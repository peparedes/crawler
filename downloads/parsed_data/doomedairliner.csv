"event","<P>Just got home from Matt Zambo's house, watched a movie there, had good company.... Before that i was at the PR park watching the fireworks, it was actually really awesome, i was expecting it to be really lame.&nbsp; So reciently life has consisted of chillin' with good friends and having good times, without any kind of drama or anything.&nbsp; Outside of the house that is.... my mom has been a nazi reciently, all of the suddon she doesn't trust me with anything, and its really frustrating.</P>
<P>Well, my last entry before i go to the youth leadership thingamagig... So heres the deal... I get dropped at the train station with 3 big ass bags, then i take it to grand central, subway to penn station, penn station to D.C. and taxi to the camp... its going to be a bitch.&nbsp; I leave for 10 days and after that i stay for another day and visit some colleges then i come home for about a week.&nbsp; And after that week i'm gone till the 12th of August.</P>
<P>I'm mad tired, and i dont have anything of much substance to say... so if you love me leave me a comment or email me <A href=""mailto:dkurzewick@yahoo.com"">dkurzewick@yahoo.com</A> or call me (914-552-7832) or visit me, or just give your body to me.&nbsp; Anywho... Peace out bitches!</P>

"event","<P>What up bitches.... I'm in a funky mood today.&nbsp; Overall, things have been pretty hectic, trying to think deep thoughts when everything and everyone around me isn't serious at all.&nbsp; But, other than that, i have two new sisters (Kristina and Liz) and they are the bestest.</P>
<P>Well, the summer offically started when we all camped out at the morrissey residence (me, alanna, liz, alex, randall, kristen, mel (at the end)) and made smores and other goodies.&nbsp; Although nobody really slept, it was awesome... and gazing at the stars made me realize that i love astronomy... i haven't EVER thought of any field i could possibly love in my life so this is a revelation.....&nbsp; Like, i mean, i really wanna be an astronomer.&nbsp; Well, back to the story:&nbsp; After the camping we went to the beach which was awesome.</P>
<P>After somemore drama i've just been having a good time, i'm so very lucky that i have the friends i have, honestly.</P>
<P>Just getting prepared for the rest of my summer, road test the 2nd, i leave the 5th i think then i'm gone playing soccer till august...&nbsp; I'm really excited, only a bit scared my shoulder will die, but whatevs!</P>

"event","Wuts up everyone... Im soo tired i got back yesterday from Orlando at 5 in the morning. My legs n everything hurt from walking around soo much. We went to Bucsh Gardens, Universal Studios, and Islands of Adventures. The best was Bucsh Gardens because it was a big safari. It had all kinds of animals an rides. I didnt ride any roller coasters though[im scaredd of heights]. Lauren, Nicole, and I rode the sky line the most cause Lauren yelled at everyone... it was funny. We went and saw this 4-d movie called the haunted lighthouse and it shot water at you and fake rats came under ur seats and touched ur feet we freaked out. It was cool though. At universal we rode more rides... like jaws ans E.T. and the woody woodpecker kiddy roller coaster. It was Ok. I think the very best rides were at islands of adventures though cause they had the spiderman and the dudley doright rip saw falls. we got soaking wet on that ride. The drop at the end was sooo steep that when you went down it u couldnt breathe to scream. We were so mad though because of what we saw on a sign. taking back Sunday was going to play right after we left. But anyways tomorrow is goin 2 sux because i got to get my tonsils and adnoids out. I got told it was going to hurt really bad. I will be out of school for two weeks though. Nikki is gonna be over here EvErDaY and help me out around the house n take care of me.... i luv u Nikki!! well neways i g2g i'll holla l8er..."

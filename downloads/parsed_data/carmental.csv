Really hot.

So hot, that I don't know if I want anything to eat today, I'd have to cook, and it is wayyyyy too hot to cook.

But otherwise, it is starting to cool down, maybe in an hour or so I will go and make something for dinner.

Tomorow will kill though.

I live on the coast, and work inland. &nbsp;There is a wonderful *sarcasm* twenty degree difference in temperature.&nbsp; Joy.&nbsp; But the most fun is where I bike, for a mile and a half each way.&nbsp; Inland. &nbsp;Where it is death in the summer.

Oh god!&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't I just deal and get a car already??????

But, I&nbsp;ride my bike anyway.

At least this will be a hell of a weight loss program. &nbsp;I&nbsp;should take before and after pictures... before the hell that summer is going to be, and after, when I am a stick.&nbsp; So, I'll at least look forward to that. &nbsp;Maybe that can help me get through being dehydrated and exausted and burnt to an unreconizable crisp.&nbsp; iiiick.

Oh well, I am done wining now.&nbsp;"

"event","<br />yes, it has been forever, right?<br /><br />Anyway, lots have happened in the last couple months. &nbsp;I&nbsp;got sued by someone I don't know, for roughly $4000.&nbsp; one thousand of which was hijacked from my checking and savings accounts two days before I got any notifications about the suit.<br />That was fun... still though, any lawyers out there that might be able to help me?<br /><br />Looking to start up a business (actual in a store business selling touchable product) but don't quite know how to get the funding, everyone (banks) keep telling me to find a friend with a house that they are willing to put up for collateral. &nbsp;Right.&nbsp; 1. Like I&nbsp;have friends who have houses.&nbsp; 2. Like any of them would put thier homes up for collateral so I&nbsp;can start a business.<br /><br />So, instead I&nbsp;am doing my best to sell Discount Health and Dental plans.&nbsp; And, being that&nbsp;I&nbsp;work with insurances at work... in a dental office... I have gotten to know some really good dental plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for those who can't afford insurance (which normally start at $200, if you are young with no pre-qualifications)&nbsp; the Discount Plans that I sell are godsends.<br /><br />I'll get back to that.<br /><br />Anyway, December 2007 I got Employee of the Month!&nbsp;&nbsp;Woo hoo.<br />The Head Assistant said it was because I always came to work really really early.&nbsp; And on the bus to boot.<br />Kinda took the spark away.<br /><br />Um, lately my boss has been really getting on my nerves, telling me to do other people's work.&nbsp; Last Thursday afternoon he tried to tell me to do something that was completly out of the range of what I do there, and I&nbsp;told him.&nbsp; Kinda got a bit mean.&nbsp; Mostly along the lines of&nbsp; &quot;I don't do that job, I do these six other jobs, you want me to start doing that too, your going to have to finally give me a raise, we both know you won't do that, so fuck off, get out of my office and let me do what I do that keeps all of us in paychecks.&quot;<br />A few minutes later, after the boss stumbled out of my office and remarkably no one else bothered me for the rest of the day, I kinda felt like I crossed some line.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;was frustrated and wasn't able to stop myself.<br /><br />Friday started, and the owner of the place, Dr G., has a solem look on his face in the middle of the check out area of the dental office as he asks me to come over, he has something he wants to tell me.<br /><br />...<br /><br />He then holds up a plaque with my name on it and says &quot;You are the Employee of the Month this month!&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations.&quot;<br /><br />Yeah, I was shocked. &nbsp;And I totally forgot what happened the day before until today when talking with 't00n over dinner.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had told his friends the story over the weekend and none of them could stop laughing. &nbsp;Hell, as I remembered the events of last week, I couldn't help but laugh.<br />I work in a wierd... wierd office.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Okay, so back to the Dental and Health Discount plans.<br /><br />I now sell these plans, and it doesn't matter where you are, you can be here in San Diego, or up there in Portland.&nbsp;You can travel across the country or have regular trips to randomness and still be qualified for the plan.&nbsp; In fact, there are no pre-qualifications.&nbsp; Okay, there is one, you have to like discounts.<br /><br />So this isn't an insurance.&nbsp; This is a discount, so you can go to any doctor, anywhere, and you get the same treatment. &nbsp;No restrictions.&nbsp; But you do have to pay when you make a visit.&nbsp; But, if you don't have insurance, this is a great start, better even than the free clinics.<br /><br />So, check it out:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.EveryoneBenefits.com/SCass"">http://www.EveryoneBenefits.com/SCass</a>, or <a href=""http://www.mybenifitsplus.com/SCass"">www.mybenifitsplus.com/SCass</a><br /><br />Or, you can sell these too.&nbsp; Yea, yea, MLM, it's annoying. &nbsp;But only when the product sucks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This discount plan is really good. &nbsp;Hell, my dental office takes the Dental Plan.&nbsp; And those patients&nbsp;get the same awesome treatment all our other patients get.&nbsp; And.... if you sign up to sell this, you get Dental discounts, Vision discounts, and Chriopratic discounts&nbsp;included.<br /><br />So&nbsp;check that out:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.IBOPlus.com/SCass"">www.IBOPlus.com/SCass</a>&nbsp;,or <a href=""http://www.myhomebusinesspays.com/SCass"">www.myhomebusinesspays.com/SCass</a><br /><br />Go ahead and do it already, and hell, if you join up to sell, or become an Independent Broker, you can write off all sorts of stuff as work related (including the broker fee!). &nbsp;That'll be very nice next April.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Okay, I'm off my soap box now, have fun, enjoy your night.<br />"

"event","So, there I was, just a couple weeks ago, I felt the 10pm, drinking-wayyy-too-much urge to make plans to go to Julian for a weekend.<br /><br />Well, Friday rolled around and there I was picking up my 2008 PT&nbsp;Cruiser, silver at the Dollar Rental place. &nbsp;I had found a year ago or so that Dollar Rental is actually cheaper than other rental companies(Hertz, Budget, Enterprize) by half, even when the Dollar Rental place doesn't have a AAA&nbsp;discount. &nbsp;( I discount the really cheap scum-bag rental places, because eeeeeeewwwwwwwwww.)<br /><br />After getting packed, my huney and I were off to have fun in the mountains... <br /><br />The drive up was uneventful, although those curvey-windy roads were almost like driving in a video game, it was still pretty simple.<br /><br />We checked into the hotel, Old&nbsp;Oak Hill Hotel, which is really someone's home that has turned his barn into a multiple studio room hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp;We got room #1 and it was pretty huge... A queen size bed, with an entry way/dining room that had wood flooring and a cute tiny round table with a couple chairs, as well as a pantry filled with a loaf of date-nut raisin bread and orange juice and yogart and tea and coffee.... there were a couple windows, one that was also a sliding glass door that can be used instead of the main entry way. &nbsp;But the nice thing, there was no phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;No internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a tv and a couple heaters (one looked like a fire place, but didn't emit much heat, the owner said something about returning it to the maker for one that might actually work.)<br /><br />Not that I don't like being on the internet, but being disconnected for a short time, is actually really nice.<br /><br />So, we were hungry, it was about noon, and we hadn't eaten.&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked down to Main street and went to Miners Diner. &nbsp;I had a veggie sandwich and he had a &nbsp;buffalo burger (&quot;made with real buffalo! Really!&quot; &nbsp;the menu said.) &nbsp;Anyway, it was yummy.<br />Well, we were well sated and decided to go look at some of the stores we didn't get to on my birthday when we first went up. &nbsp;And we bought stuff.<br />A walking stick for 't00n,<br />a tea strainer,<br />a really pretty butterfly hair clip,<br />lots of candy and chocolate,<br />a new t-shirt with a little girl holding a baby dragon.<br /><br />Soon after all the shopping, we went back on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;We drove randomly down a few empty, dark, curvy, scary, tree filed highways and back when I said.... okay, waaaaayyyy too creepy.<br /><br />Anyway, by the time we got back to main street it was roughly 8 or 9 pm, and we then went to a restaurant to have some dinner... I was craving soup. &nbsp;We went to RongBranch Diner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was definatly wrong. &nbsp;As in yucky, &nbsp;bland, sick looking food.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, don't have to spend another dime there again.<br /><br />Back to the hotel and fell asleep to the heater keeping us warm and cozy, and the tv droning on about the recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah life. &nbsp;Ain't it wonderful.<br /><br />Saturday:<br /><br />We wake at a casual hour of 9am and decide that breakfast at the Miners Diner would be a wonderful thing to do. &nbsp;I get pancakes and eggs with spiced hot chocolate he gets a ham steak with hot cider. &nbsp;We are both happy.<br /><br />But we shopped all day long yesterday! Yes, but there are a couple more things to still do.<br />&nbsp;We went to a book store to try to find his elusive book, and didn't, but we got a copy of the Duncow with the cover on it.<br />And then I got a walking stick.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be fun to mess around with.<br /><br />But then we wanted to do more,<br /><br />So, guess what?&nbsp;&nbsp;We drove down to Viejas for outlet shopping!<br /><br />So we do. &nbsp;It wasn't that rainy, at least on the way down I could sort of see a few feet out.<br /><br />Viejas was fun, really pretty place, and we shopped in the rain.<br />got some new pants for me (have designs on the butt pockets),<br />a $60 two week old really happening game for only $10,<br />and some Duff beer (an energy drink).<br /><br />Then we came back to a rainy Julian and relaxed at a nice happening Italian restaurant that serves alcohol. &nbsp;I am wondering if that is why everyone in town was there. It was good food, and there was a nice italian beer that they served, but I can't remember the name of it.<br />After the beering and dining, we went to see a town play, A Christmas Carol. &nbsp;Yeah, didn't really expect like super duper effects or acting skill, but I was at least expecting to actually see what was going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, (to those who direct plays:) if you are going to make a play, and you know that the seats are all level, don't have your actors sit on the ground all the time, because those of us in the back can't see what is going on much less hear it.<br />But that isn't was really bugged me.&nbsp;&nbsp;What bugged me was the jack ass in front of me, who really didn't have the seat in front of me, just moved there at curtain, and kept his head just so that no one behind him can see the stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn packed house. &nbsp;Damn jackass.<br /><br />At intermission we left. &nbsp;Couldn't deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we know the story anyway.<br /><br />We went back to the hotel to eat some candy and watch some tube... there was a political discussion that was pretty entertaining, that I fell asleep to.<br /><br />Sunday:<br />I had to pee at about 5 or 6 am.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then just because, I went to take a look outside......<br /><p>OMG&nbsp;IT&quot;S&nbsp;SNOWING! &nbsp;It was sooooooooo awesome!<br />So, after squeeling at cart00n, I got my boots on, and in my pj's I played around outside in awe at the snow, watched it go from really big flakes to small crystals back to big flakes, I felt like I was in wonderland. &nbsp;But I was in Julian, so I suppose that's almost the same.<br /><br />A few minutes later, after getting cold, I walked back inside to warm up and just stared out the window until the flakes made way for just the crystals that made way for rain. &nbsp;*pout* &nbsp;And I crawled back into bed. &nbsp;That was awesome!&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Around 11 or so we packed up and headed out, the owner said to just leave the key on the table and lock up when we leave, so we did so, after leaving a heart felt letter of appreciation, and a promise that we will be back on Valentines...<br /><br />And we headed back.<br /><br />Got home, unpacked the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did my best not to cry about having to return the car. &nbsp;And drove off to the car rental place.<br /><br />On the 8 freeway going west toward the 5, there was this really really crazy guy, who actually looked normal enough, but was probably deranged, as he walked into traffic daring every passing car to run him over. &nbsp;He got really pissed when I swerved around him, he was shaking his fists in the air wanting death. &nbsp;We were able later to find a cop watching over traffic a little bit away to tell them of the incident, but I am fairly certain that someone swerving around the death-wisher had a cell phone.<br /><br />After *pout* returning the PT&nbsp;Cruiser, we took the trolly and a bus back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;And now here were are.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow I have to go back to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;But today I remain headache free and very calm and happy. &nbsp;I like that.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

It's an interesting time of year of cooking and eating and schmoozing and family feudes,&nbsp; but this year,&nbsp;I get to cook the bird!&nbsp; w00t!

So far, so good.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think it is almost done, although it's a&nbsp;bit earlier than originally thought, but I&nbsp;think that will be okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some family came&nbsp;by with pies, and M&amp;M will bring green beans and yams,&nbsp;and 't00n is currently making potatos.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yummy&nbsp;day&nbsp;today.&nbsp; And it smells just awesomely!

Anyway, hoping for M&amp;M to get here soon, so that I can&nbsp;get some extra juice on the bird before I take it&nbsp;out, but I think it&nbsp;should be okay, maybe though a bit over done.... but just a bit enough to make sure that I don't get roped into&nbsp;making dinner every holiday.&nbsp; But this year is fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will&nbsp;see.

Anyway,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;I should go back now... yes, I am lame,&nbsp;don't&nbsp;have a&nbsp;camera, but it is turning out as&nbsp;pretty and crusty as last year's turkey.&nbsp; Can't wait to eat.&nbsp;

Update from Hangover central: Everyone loved it. &nbsp;Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, tasty, the gravy was a bit thick, but otherwise, dude.... I wonder how many beers I drank yesterday....? &nbsp;I kinda lost track. &nbsp;But, there was hardly any leftovers. &nbsp;And people were asking for seconds even after they were incredibly full. &nbsp;Oh, we even had two extra people show up!&nbsp;&nbsp;It was awesome.

And the Chef, the Chef, he liked it! &nbsp;He really liked it.

Update 11-30 at 4:11pm: &nbsp;I made a delightful turkey dinner pie with the leftovers (savory pie crust that of course I made, mashed potato's, shreaded turkey, frozen veggies, more shreaded turkey, and yummy yummy gravy).&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me tell you, the pie is amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;A little salt and pepper, and it's perfect! &nbsp;I was originally thinking of eating a slice of pie with some cranberry sauce, but damn... doesn't need it.
Anyway, gonna take some with me to work tomorrow if my huney doesn't finish it off... which, if he does, I soooo totally understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean dude, that pie is awesome!

Pie, pie.... I like pie!"

Palin was never on the National scene for more than a few minutes at a time, and local reporting only goes so far on a governor with an 80% approval rating. However, the motivation to cover daughter's pregnancy aligns with her political standings. She valiantly did not perform an abortion, but fell into the fundamentalist way of thinking, and covered up for the illicit (but natural) action's of her daughter.<br /><br />There could be calls below to delete this information. Calls that this type of information is muckraking and 'below us'. The truth is not below any progressive, nor any citizen of the world that is one heartbeat away from having Palin as leader of the free world. We simply ask that she be forthright, honest, and not waste our time with such juvenile games that anyone with eyes can see as fabrication.<br /><br />Bristol Palin rightfully should be able to embrace her child in public as her own, with no shame, and no quarter. And a mother should be just as accepting.&quot;</a>"

"event","This is a weird question, I live in this house that is right next to the busstop.  In the past week there has been this bum that cart00n has repetedly seen shitting on our house.  And I have seen him pissing in the neighbors flowers.  We have confronted the bum and he says this is public property and that we can't move him.

What do I do?

I've got pictures.

Update:
I called the cops.  They have a profile, and are now canvasing the area at night a bit more frequently... heh, the people driving home from the bars lately aren't too happy because of all the cars that are pulled over (at least three a night now.)  But there hasn't been any new stains.  The only thing is though, I have seen this guy a couple times in the area, across the street and a few blocks up... so they haven't got him, but hopefully he is scared enough to leave me well enough alone.
I called the manager.  He has a profile, and talked to his cop buddies.  And hopefully this will help him get the permits he needs from the city to build the fence he has wanted.  In just a week he's getting the maintenance man to do some sort of super spray cleaning to remove the yuck.

Thanks for your help everyone.  You guys rule."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chemical compound in the abortion pill RU-486 blocked formation in mice of breast tumors caused by a mutant gene blamed in many women's breast and ovarian cancers, researchers found. 

The study, published on Thursday in the journal Science, suggests a potential new path to protect women genetically predisposed to these cancers by using drugs to interfere with a hormone called progesterone, the researchers said.

A team led by University of California at Irvine scientist Eva Lee found that the compound, mifepristone, prevented breast tumors by blocking progesterone in mouse breast tissue cells.

They said they found that progesterone, which is involved in the female reproductive cycle, stimulates the proliferation of breast cells carrying a gene linked to breast cancer, possibly feeding tumor growth.

Women with a mutated version of the gene, known as BRCA-1, face a much higher risk of breast and ovarian cancers. By age 70, more than half of them end up with one of the two types of cancer.

Some of these women opt to have their breasts or ovaries surgically removed to lower the risk. This study raises hope that they might have another option -- using drugs rather than surgery to guard against cancers linked to the mutated gene.

In its normal form, BRCA-1 protects against cancer, suppressing tumor formation by assisting cells to repair DNA damage that could lead to cancer-causing mutations.

In this study, the researchers focused on how mifepristone influences the way the mutated gene functions in tissue, using mice with the rodent version of the mutated gene.

TUMOR-FREE MICE

Mice given mifepristone were tumor-free by the time they were a year old, while the mice that did not get it all developed tumors by the time they were 8 months old, the researchers found.

Progesterone stimulates the development of tumors when the mutated gene is present because it accelerates cell division, but mifepristone interfered with a process needed for progesterone to spur the division of cells, the study found.

""By targeting the progesterone receptor, it's very possible that we can prevent the breast cancer, especially in the high risk BRCA-1 area,"" Lee said in a telephone interview.

Mifepristone is the chemical compound present in RU-486, sold as Mifeprex and made by Danco Laboratories LLC. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2000 for medical abortions in women pregnant as long as seven weeks.

Mifeprex blocks production of progesterone, which keeps a fertilized egg implanted in the uterus. Mifeprex is taken with another drug called misoprostol to trigger an abortion. It is unrelated to emergency contraception sold by Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the name Plan B.

Lee noted that mifepristone may not be the best treatment for long-term cancer prevention because it affects things other than progesterone and might cause unacceptable side effects like suppressing the body's immune system.

""Mifepristone may not be the best for prevention purposes. The reason is that mifepristone actually has very broad activities, and we are aware that there are other compounds that are more specific. Those kind of compounds probably have greater potential in terms of prevention,"" Lee said.

I would have an abortion. The circumstances under which I would, might, have, or might have chosen to have an abortion are nobody's business but mine and those I choose to tell. They are not the business of any government. I do not accept the proposition that either the state or my sexual partner(s) should have any say over when and if I choose to bear a child. I do not accept any sovereignty over my body and my reproductive organs but my own. If faced with the situation, I will do everything feasible to help other women and girls I know exercise their rights to safely terminate a pregnancy if they so choose. When a state treats women and girls as chattel, the state is committing a crime.

"event","I love voting.  One of the patriotic things to do, don'tcha know?  And lately (as in the last few years) I have been going to the polling place with Ma.  So, this time around was no different (in the part that Ma and I went voting, not in the part that there was a darned election ramble ramble ramble...) except for the fact that I had to wake up early to vote with Ma.  Because she needed to get out and to the bus to get to work.  Anyway, I woke at 5am, we were out the door by 6:45am and thought we were at our polling place a bit after seven.

In the room where we vote, this is at a park-school-ground-area-thingy, there were at least five women scurrying about setting up tables and assigning who's to do what.  Then, in front of Ma and I were two or three women of differing ages, a couple of them with kids in tow.  Ma mentions later that there was a guy behind us, but that doesn't count... he got there after all this that I tell now.

Yeah, all women.  Dude.  73ish years ago, this scene would be all men.  I am quite proud that I have this chance to make a difference.  And very glad that other women do too.  Yup, just a bit o' feminism popping through here.  *beam*  (I mean, I am female, how can I not be *for* women?  That would be kinda, you know, stupid.  But I digress.)

So, waiting in line one woman walks in saying 'okay, it's seven now, can I vote?' and one of the women working the polling place said, 'nope, still 6:57, got a few minutes left.'  And we waited even more.  But that was cool to open a polling place... never done that before.  Then as we filed in and gave our names, no need for id.. hmmm... one of the ladys in front of me was pulled to the side, and one of the workers showed her the ballot box, you know, that big black filing-box-piggy-bank-thingy-with-slit-on-top-and-lock-to-side?  The worker showed it as if she were preparing for a magic trick.  Hmmmm...  But the cool thing I noticed, was that the ballots were just one piece of paper.  No cover paper, which took me (and apparanty Ma) by suprize as I was looking for that ballot booklet that covered my votes, but instead the ballot was double the length it normally is and when I finished, figured out that all I needed was to fold it over, and voila pop it into the ballot box.

So, anyway, as per the title, Ma and I were talking about this vote as we have always done, but this time while walking though the park grounds nearby where the grass was green (with splotches of brown and mud) and soggy and ants were everywhere and the breeze screamed past our heads.

Yup.  I like voting.  It's like a walk through the park."

"event","Okay, so halloween was a couple days ago, and yup, I dressed up.
<lj-cut>
Here I am concocting a witchy brew.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/witchy.jpg"" height=200 width=150>

Then just to show how far I have gone, and because I just saw the pictures... here goes... hair length went drastically short this year.

I mean, last year it was really long...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/valentine.jpg"" height=200 width=150>

Then in February I cut it.  And went from three and a half feet to fifteen inches...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/sit.jpg"" width=150 height=200>

And still I wasn't satisfied.  So I dyed it.  But the color didn't show all that well in the photographs...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/red.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
But I'm telling ya, that is red hair.  Went from dirty blonde to red.  It was quite a change.

Still I wasn't satisfied.  So I dyed it different shades of red.. orange... copper... cherry.  Then I went to Europe.  And I dyed it again for the kick of it.  But I came back and Ma and I just recently, err, last weekend, went and cut our hair.

I cut really short.  Check this out.
Before going into the hair salon...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/29bb50b1.jpg"" width=150 height=200>

Then after the hair salon... drum roll please...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v714/Carmental/real%20me/newhair.jpg"" width=175 height=200>

Yup.  Real difference.  And I kinda like it.  But I am not going to go any shorter.  I think I like it a bit longer than it is...  Anyway, what do you think?  Funny, ehh?

"event","Yeah, I am back.  And it feels very wierd.  <lj-cut>I want to be back in London and just wander the streets again, or have breakfast in a cafe again.  I want to have Europe at my fingertips to play with as I will.  I want to drink coke out of small tall bottles.  I want the smells and the looks of people wondering why I seem so foreign.  I want it all back damn it.

But I am home.  Not quite settled back in yet.  Lots have happened and there is a lot to review and analize.  I still haven't even fully unpacked yet.  I showed Ma some of the things I have collected, given a few stories here and there, but nothing nearly half of what I have collected yet.

Shortly, I go back down to San Diego.  Do my travels ever stop?  No.  Just slow to a nice rhythmic beat.

So many things happened with me in such a short time.  I haven't quite caught up with myself.

When I do... I should get work again, and start all over.  Until my next big adventure.

But I figured that you would all want to hear from me so there it is... let us do a run down of where I have been and what I have done and what I liked most.  You see, I have been keeping a diary of events and such, and it is the first time in a very long time that I have completed a diary in such a short time period.  I mean, this one book was started in May this year and just ended Oct 12th.  Only because I was out of pages.  Wow.

-July 31 to August 1, flight over atlantic to Great Britan.  Pretty as always.
-August 2 first full day in London with Ma.  Had fun, went on a tour to Stonehenge and Bath.  Impressed.
-August 3, got lost on my wadering towards Buckingham palace, but then took a bus/train to London Eye and later Thames River Cruise, where on the way I walked across the Tower Bridge and had some nice ice cream.
Had Treacle Pudding.  Ick.
-August 4 Ma and I got on the Easy Jet plane to Glasgow.  Start of WorldCon.  wow.  Good fun.
-August 4-8 WorldCon.  I impressed people left and right with my corset dress and made people wonder at me when I was working the autographing tables with Ma when I was half asleep... or sick.
Ma Leaves for London to go to Paris.  I won't see her until October.
-August 9.  I start by train... but before I take my first train trip, I go to the Glasgow Imax and see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... ick.  And then I do my first tower climb... into Glasgow Tower.  Fun.
That night I end up in York at a hostel that I pick out last minute at the York train station.
-August 10.  I climb the York Minster tower.  Pay a couple pounds to have a certificate sent to me at home.  (I got the cert today and I like it.)  Then I take the train again... I wrote a poem:
""The One""
Maybe one day he will see it.
Took a train to London, then to Penzance, the second train is a sleeper train... total first class service for a an extra 21Pounds.  About the same price for a stay at a hostel.  Nice.
-August 11 Penzance.  Stayed at Carlton Hotel, basically a bed a breakfast for 20 pounds... woot.  Right on the beach even... hey wait a minute, I hate beaches?  Don't I?
Had dinner at Admiral Benbow, looked like the inside of a ship... nice people.  
Tipsy off one glass of wine.
-August 12 Sitting at the beachside taking pictures and writing.  Also went to a place near St. Mary's Church called Muffins ETC.  Had Cream Tea.  Nice...  Yummy.  Talked to locals, when I could find them.  This was a different kind of tourist place... a tourist place for the British.  Felt, comforting.
Journaled musings:
""Bumble bee's are everywhere.  Not honey bees, but bumblebees.  You know, those big furry ones?  hehe, ine of them was on a wall just complaining about life - buzzbuzz buuuuzzz it said.  I smirked, it stoped and waved its wings and said a jolted Bzz!  Damn cute.""
Train trip to Burmingham.  Asked attendant about sandwiches he had, and found out definition of Bap... bread.
Got off and found a random con goer named Martha and got a place to stay for the night at a bar/hotel place.  Huge room, free transportation to the con.  Dude.
-August 13 LOTR Con.  Well, lecture hall.  Well, actually at the university, using all six levels, elevators not working, no place to put my luggage.   Was followed by David- err some guy at the con that was there at WorldCon.  Wouldn't go away.  Went to Masqurade at night, really nifty costuming.
Left in Cab to train station.  Wanted to go somewhere a bit more intertaining...
Almost ten pm.  Hardly any more trains to anywhere, so I take just a random train... looks like I hopped onto train to Leicester.  Nice hour ride.  But the Leicester train station looked uninviting, so I took the last train out, waited for an hour.
Train to Nottingham.
-August 14 Nottingham.  Got there early, after one am.  Found a hotel near the station.  Apparantly a bed a breakfast.  Had breakfast later that morning after a long sleep.  Apparantly everyone was watching a Cricket game or something.
Take train in morning to London.  Meet up with Lunatic.  Meet his friends.  Have a good round of card games... stay at his friend's place.
-August 15 Shopping.  Clothing shopping in gothic district.  Hehe... fun stuff.. Lunatic leaves? or the next day, didn't write anything down unti the 18th. See a movie, Skeleton Key, with Lisa and her husband?  I think so... must check earlier entries here.
-August 16 touring.  Friend of Lisa's, Alex takes me around London, places I didn't see before.  Trafalgar square, china town, convent garden, movie... saw Kung Fu Hustle.  Had dimsum.  Never had that before... yummy.
-August 17 leave for contiki hotel -ick.  Alex holds my bear for me... thanks.  Meet with him and a group of people at a nifty bar down the way from my hotel.  Got drunk off two? beers and followed mice around the room.  Yeah.  Got back to hotel.
-August 18 Woke late.  To housekeeping asking me to get out.  They have no soul.  6pm, Ultimate European Tour started.  Well, actually met people that I was going to have to survive with for the next couple months.  Ended up that when I got back to my room there was someone there sharing the room with me.  Bummer, turned out to be a nifty person... Somaly.
-August 19.  Real start of the tour.  Woke at 5am to get downstairs and packed on the bus by 6am. Went to france via ferry.  Because the bus we rode was 'home' now on.
Stay in nasty campsite half hour drive away from Paris.
-August 20.  At the Louve.  Georgous paintings and statues...  Went to Arc De Triumph and largest traffic circle.  French people like to drive fast and careless.  But otherwise really nice people.  Got some cheese and wine and bread and grapes and olives for 20euros.  Got a reciept that said it would have cost 133 Franks before the change over to Euros.  Had a good dinner that night at the campsite.
-August 21.  Did my first completly foreign language transaction.  So proud.  Drove around the garden in a golf cart at the Palace of Versallias. Pretty.  Walked up stairs of the Eiffel Tower.  I wished cart00n was around at the time.
-August 22 and 23 and 24.  Bus to Boujalois wine region.  Well, really a Chatou in the middle of vinyards.  Miles and miles of vinyards.  Had a wine tasting, like grape juice was the going thought... blah.  Tryed to get a picknick in at the 'top of the world', but was rained out, so most of us headed over to a bar in the nearist town and drank until the rain stoped.  I drank soda all day... watched them drink beer like it was water.  Had a 'Pimps and Prostitutes' Party, duh I was bell of the ball.
-August 25 another 'ass crack of dawn' waking... wouldn't be the last.  On bus again to Barcelona.  Had tour of Barcelona... not really interested in olympic stadiums.  Saw the nasty church building, designed my Gaudy.  And damn, is it Gaudy.  Ick.  Got a pin with a picture of the church on it anyway.
-August 26 diched the tour and wandered on my own.  Found a market where I totally immersed myself in Spanish.  Really fun.  Then I met up with some of the tour's Aussie boys and had drinks and food at Hard Rock Cafe.  Where I got a tank top.
-August 27 bus to French Riviera.  Past few nights I had bad dreams of running from police.  WTF?
-August 28 walked around Nice.  Got my nails done, french tip.  hehe.  Then at night, had a nervous break down.  cart00n is really good to me.  Calmed me down.
-August who knows, loosing track.  Stoped by a perfumery... my nose took quite a beating.  Ouch.  Also passed by the Tower of Pisa.  Smaller than I thought.
-August who knows anymore.  Had a gondola ride with four other people; James, Beck, Somaly and someone else... yeah.
-August 31, Wednesday.  In florence, walked to the top of Giotto's Tower.  In a skirt and my boots.  Hard climb, but totally worth it for the view at the very least.
Also had the stupid bedbugs panic.  Those aussies really are annoying.
-September  on the way to corfu, took an overnight ferry.  Long bus rides as well.
-September 5 Corfu.  Went on something called Georges Boat.  Crazy, in lame way.  Got a tank top.  But I was sick.  So I wasn't really in a mood for water sports... and the weather was with me on that one.  Cloudy... and rainy.
Greece rule - don't flush toilet paper down toilets.  It will back up.
Got a few Austrailian slang words down:  Cobber means Good Friend.  G'Day Mate, ya'll know that one.  Get a dog up ya means have a drink.  Fair Dinkun, true.  Fiesty is icky/dirty.  a Poof is a gay guy.  And to Scull is to drink a regular sized beer (LOL) like a shot.
-September Athens.  One night.  Then ferry to Mykonos island.
-September (one week) Mykonos resort living.  Recover from latest cold.  Eat at buffets made for kings twice a day.  Slept a lot.  In my room, at the pool, at the beach.  Wandered into town at one point, had a crepe to eat for lunch, got a shirt and wandered down little, I mean very damn small corridors of streets. 
-September still, ferry back to Athens.  One night there.  Stayed a night at Kavakale in Greece before crossing the border into Turkey.  Apparantly there was quite a lot of bad blood.  Saw Anzac coast, apparantly the memorial to austrialia, as James said, the first time thier country was on the world stage.  Saw Troy.  *Smiles*
Stayed at the best hotel yet.
-September 17.  Istanbul.  Wanna go back.. again and again.  That night went to dinner/ bellydancing show.  Got drunk off two glasses of wine.  Fell down leaving the establishment, left a really huge bruise on my knee, and a scrape that looked like a heart.

-September 19.  Bulgaria.  Dicthed the group again, only to meet up with the drinkers of the tour: Ray, Jason, Paul and Nigel.  We found a cheap out of the way place to eat.  Good food too.  Drank our asses off.  Went to many bars.  had fun.  I stumbled back to the hotel at some point.  
New flu.  Ick... The tour make me feel physically sick.  Grr.

-September 30 The tables are turned on the bus.  They now feel my wrath.  Gosh it feels good to finally let off steam... and all they do is bitch and moan and take it.  WTF?
-October 1 In Amsterdam we saw cheese demos and clog making demos... actually in twenty minutes we saw this guy make on shoe.  Small, but still made the shoe... dude.  Took a cute bike ride to see a windmill and wander the country side. There was a diamond show that we went to.  OMG.  I cry. Saw a sex show.

Brian and i spent our wedding night at a Best western in Olean, NY and relaxed in a huge Jaquizzi. it was just ducky...actually it was really great. we got home lastnight and conked right out. then today it was back to the grindstone."

"event","and i will be Mrs. Brian Cutway...he he he!!! it feels a little weird but it is a very good weird. i was just talkin to a good friend who was telling me about another one of my good friends who had a huge thing for me but was too afraid to tell me he liked me and now i guess he is kickin himself. The thing is that had he asked im not sure what i would have said because shortly after realizing that i kinda had a thing for him i fell head over heels for brian and i will never give him up. i guess it is just weird the way things work. For another example, Brian and i are getting married early and we expected my family to be the ones that would have a problem with it and in the end it is his family that seems to have the big problem with it. then of course we are having our wedding early so my parents wouldnt go over board and they are still prolly gonna do that. there is just no winning but i guess the bright side is that brian and i will be married and not to sound to corny but live happily ever after...lol. I know we will have some problems but honestly what relationship doesnt?!!! I hope that all my friends that i have invited can make it to the reception but so far not many of them can. that is ok it will still be fun. Ok ill prolly write more later as the Big day gets closer."

I just want to blat right now cuz he's not home for me to talk to.

He and i are happy and excited. my family is getting better with the idea but i found out today that his isnt so ok with it. they are thinking that im to blame for it. His sister says that she understands why we are doing it and when i gave her more of the reasons why she said not to mention them to the rest of the familybecause then i would be the bad guy in this. I just dont get it. why cant they all just be happy for us. We are and we just want to be able to say we are married and happy. we both know that marriage is basically just a piece of paper but that piece of paper says a lot. I just want everyone to be happy for us. ok well i am gonna go. write more later."

The me getting married and living with brian are good kinds of crazy but the part where my sister is moving to Arizona is just wrong. She has been on this whirlwind ride since her and eric split up and it is not at all good. Everyone in the family is just hoping and praying that she figures things out before she does something really derastic and im afraid she already has. She is my sister and i will always stick beside her and her ideas no matter how hairbrained they are. I just hope that she knows what she is doing."

"event","Well right now it is just about time for everyone to start bitching and yellin at eachother because it is almost the end of the semester. I know i have been doing my fair share of being a bitch and there is still 1 more full week to go. I am happy that i have my major projects done close to a week ahead of time though so that is pretty good for me anyway. I want this semester to be over but then again i want it to last forever because tonight meg and i were sitting here talking about the summer and it brought to my eyes the truth about this summer. in two weeks brian will be gone...not for good but for a month or two before he gets where ever he is going and neither of us want to be apart but that is all part of ""growing Up"" and being in a relationship. I know we will be fine but i dont want to have to go longer than i do now without seeing him. some people say i need to be in there shoes but they need to be in mine for a little while and they will see it is just as hard for them as it is for me to be away from the person i love most. Maybe i sound like a love sick teenager but i dont think i am. Brian and i are just about to reach our 6 month anniversary and that should be a time to say hello all over again not good bye for a little while. I know we will be fine and make it through after all i know he wont be going to florida and that is good. I was just offered a full time job that everyone says i will be crazy if i dont take but there are a lot of factors to look at. will i have enough time to do my school, can i get out in a year to move on to what i really want to do, what about the salary will they pay me enough to make it worth my while, how about benefits and so on? Life just needs to stop spinning so damn fast.but i guess i had better get some stuff done because the world wont stop just for me, although it would be really nice...lol."

"event","Well it has been 3 months since brian and i have started dating and i am happier than i have been in a long time but today i got some really sad news. He may be going to florida after graduation to work. I just dont know what to do. I mean when we started dating i had an idea that he might have to go a little ways away for the type of work he wants but i never thought it would be clear to florida. that and we had just started dating what was the point of gettin too excited about it right. well now we have been dating for like i said alittle over 3 months and i dont want to give him up that easy. i know that if he goes down there it doesnt mean im losing him but still right now i only get to see him on the weekends...i dont want that to be taken away and only be left with the phone as means of communicating with him. i know i have a few months yet but i think it is best to worry about it now so i can be truely happy for him when that time does arrive.
I just talked to my mom a little while ago and she told me that if the weather is as bad as they are predicting i cant go home and see brian. GGGGGRRRR im just gettin all kinds of bad news tonight. i think i just need to go to bed and not do anything else tonight and not talk to anyone else. the good news is that i got my history paper done. im not sure how good it is but it is off of my plate and i can concentrate on gettin other things done with. if i am stuck here beth nikkers and i are prolly gonna watch a movie or something so that will be kinda cool...girls night in. but anyway i am gonna go so i can finish up some of my other work and ill write more later. hopefully it will be some better news. goodnight!!!"

Staring 3 doors down. Great show great show. His name is brian and we just seemed to hit it off so well. He is 23, has blonde hair, a cute, white smile, and he does a pretty good scoobydoo laugh!!! that is just the cats meow!!we talked from about 6pm friday night until we got back to my house around midnight or so and then i went and took a shower then came back down and we stayed up and talked for another hour and a half. we held hands and he kept putting his arm around me. it just felt so right!!! when i told him that this was the best birthday i have had in a long time he just looked at em and told me ""well then happy birthday"" and rubbed my leg then gave me another big smile. that night was soo good that we have a second date this saturday. the plan is to go bowling then back to my friend's house where we will watch movies and stay the night.  Before anyone can say anything im not in love...im in like a lot. I am just tryin to take this one day at a time and just living in the moment. it has been a long time since i have felt this way and i would like to hold on to it and him if that is what it comes down to.well i dont really know what else to say. so ill write more later and tell how my second day went. wish me luck!!!"

"event","this weekend was fall break and i had a grand time!!!! On friday night i went home and got to go riding for about an hour, that was just awesome. then on saturday cheri, mom, and i went to an auction and bought my brother a little paint pony. His name is Trigger and he is just the most adorable thing ever!!!!! we did not get home until 9:30 that night, but it was well worth it. On sunday i got up and went riding again then the pony was brought to the barn and nathan got to go riding. i was sooooo excited for him. then the rest of the day was spent kinda relaxing and working on the new siding. Monday was kinda interesting. Dad and i went on a couple errands and then i had to stain the new back porch and finally i went riding again. That brings me to Tuesday. It was great until i went to the barn and after we (my friends cheri, fanny, and my brother and i) went riding we got back to the barn and my one horse who is a bitch started kicking at the pony and had my brother pinned inbetween the gate and the pony. I was soooo scared. needless to say that bitch is goin down the road ASAP!!!! i will not put up with a horse who wont get along with my other babies. And the really good news is i am getting at least 2 more horses!!!! I cant wait."

If it was not for Colleen, Shirls, and Beth, i probably would not have been able to make it through my second semester, i just want to say thank you. i think one of the hightlights of the semester was ronald mcdonald red and riding the bull. But there was also our talks and jumping on the beds. and who can forget the slumber party the last week of school.  Next semester will be just as fun if not better!!! that is all for now. maybe i'll write more later."

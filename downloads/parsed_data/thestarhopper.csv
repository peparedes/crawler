Between studying for, traveling to, taking, and obsessing over the NPTE (PTA licensure exam), I&#39;ve also been making the transition into my first paid position as a PTA. As of last Wednesday, I began as a PTA interim at a wonderful clinic in town. I am joining a great team and helping kind, humble people. With the advent of Thursday morning&#39;s delightful discovery of PASSING THE BLASTED THING, I feel like a weight has been lifted. Things are moving so quickly, but I feel like I am just loping along at a leisurely pace to keep up. After EVERYTHING I&#39;ve done to get to this point, it&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t handle.

*Edited 01/25/2016 - not only passed exam, working in a profession I was made for, but LICENSED to boot! 

Now comes the months of finding my groove, learning from my mistakes, but always being the best PTA I can be. And that means being the best me I can be. At this point in my life: 30 yrs old with life experience and the education cred to back it up; I have little choice in the matter - this is who I have become and she&#39;s awesome in every sense of the word :)"

"event","For the past 3 Novembers without fail, I have seen the latest &quot;Hunger Games&quot; upon its release. Carmike, Regal, and back to Carmike. &nbsp;#1 was viewed off my Charter On Demand. It was not letter-box, HD, or on the big screen. It was on my modest 16&quot; plasma back in my Lake apartment. I&#39;d just quit my job, started volunteering for experience and observation hours at my former lighting client&#39;s PT clinic, and I thought &quot;why not?&quot;&nbsp;I hadn&#39;t read the books, but I loved the characters. Girl on Fire. Boy with the Bread. Like Katniss, a spark was ignited and I wanted more.

So came the afternoons walking and reading by the lake after a morning of PT work. I buzzed through the series, kicked myself for buying and selling the beautiful hardbound Mockingjay when it came out, then fell in love all over again when I found a paper copy in the musty corner of a local bookstore. I&#39;ve gotten more than my money&#39;s worth from hours rewatching the dvds, driving and home-working to the soundtracks, and &nbsp;even reread the books last year when I was fasting for bloodwork...talk about Hunger games.

Being the romantic I am, I found it fitting to cap off the movie adaptation the way I did the original series: in the afternoon after a morning of PT work. And I was not disappointed; not to mention totally justified in sitting for 2.5 hrs after a good 5 hr half day (which the clinic works every Friday as a scheduled half-day). The movie makes the ultimate climax so subtly delicious, some critics are even missing it. When it all comes together - ohhhh boy. Let your arrow fly true.

And so ends another annual movie tradition...and the wait for the dvd release begins."

Well, I&#39;m starting week 4 of my clinical rotation at the hospital tomorrow and all I can say is: all that unknown? Shapes and forms are slowly assuming more definition. Colors indistinguishable from the black are growing brighter. I no longer feel anxious when I arrive, but excited to do my job, to share in my patients&#39; triumphs, to plan out new approaches to their care. More and more, I am understanding that this day-to-day immersion is the only way I could truly find confidence in working in the acute hospital environment. I am also amazed at how much I really know. Imagine, that whole year of book learning in the morning and practical application in the afternoon forged reliable connections between my neurons. I&#39;d love to see their activity patterns when I watch a pt perform a task...

Yup, welcome to Summer Qtr of what is hands down one of the most interesting qtrs of schooling I have ever experienced. &quot;Why?&quot; you ask? I&#39;ll tell you:
- 3 days a week we trundle in, sit lecture for 2-4 hours, break for lunch, have lab for about the same, then roll on home for a) chores b) studies c) nap d) fun in sun in Bham because...
- 4 days (with the exception of 2 weeks that force a Monday out of us) are spent on our own schedules, completing everything that was asked of us. This leaves ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE to not get any project done.

Breaks down to 4 classes and 4 days to address their assignments. Midterms start this week - *sigh*. One month from now will see the start of finals (!). 

I liken this quarter to a series of online courses. When we meet, we discuss topics we&#39;re already engaged in and apply concepts we have already been introduced to. It&#39;s actually quite fun and totally fits my learning style - reading, writing, THEN hands-on.

After the stunning results I had last quarter with my strict working schedule (8-8 with breaks kept to a max of 20 min between 2 hr blocks of work) I&#39;m letting myself have hour blocks with breaks to stretch as well as planning out weekends to check off touristy things. And breaking at 8pm no matter what for fluffy yogurt and FMAB/Internet dawdlings.

37 days is not a lot of time, but in that time, I&#39;ve got the time to make time for everything that I want to accomplish :)"

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">This weather put me in mind for watching snowy movies. Raised in the stifling humidity of Midwest Summers, mom would suggest putting on christmas movies in July. I didn&#39;t want the holiday snugglies, so I started watching Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (series, not movie) Initially to cool down - the snowy parts at Fort Briggs are enough to chill even the most staunchly proclaimed heat lover like myself. Then I realized I needed to do some research for an ongoing fic; enter episode 1 and 2. Yeah, once I started, I got right into the development of the story, characters, and taking smug satisfaction in saying &quot;no you&#39;re not!&quot; when a character makes some moment-defining statement/lie because I know what happens to them LATER. (oh Ed, how he doth protest too much...). I&#39;m now on ep 14/66.

Heat and fandoms aside, next week marks wk 2/8 for the last quarter of book learning in my program. Attended one day last week and realized that in doing so, Week 1/8 was done! With how little time we actually spend in class learning from the material and one another, I liken this quarter to online classes - ie. A LOT of independent study with little if any face-to-face time. AND a LOT of reading (was this close to using my Death by Books icon, but figured I&#39;d rather be saved by Al instead.) As I&#39;m still accountable for all the assigments and material for those 4 classes, it&#39;s not all fun, but there are certainly more hours available in the week to balance work with play. I&#39;ve got the rest of the summer weekends planned out with plenty of things to do in and around the region to make the most of my remaining days on the West Side (all 49 of them). </span>

As for those aforementioned festivities: Not too many boom booms, but enough to remind me that it&#39;s Independence Day and America&#39;s 239th b-day.Happy 4th to one and all!

Compared to the side of the Cascades I just returned from lo these 24 hrs ago, yes it&#39;s a bit warm outside, but nothing like the record temps we were breaking in K-town. It&#39;s nice enough for little me to wear khakis and a tank and not be too cold or too warm.

However, because of the expected heat, I got up this morning and decided to bake, quickly, before the house got too hot. What resulted was a delicious breakfast topper - 3 ingredient PB cookies (maple cinnamon whipped jif + small mashed banana + packet splenda). Paired my samplings with greek yogurt and blueberries and served it in the &quot;mixing bowl&quot; I had combined the ingredients in (ie the whipped jiff tub). Super easy, satisfying, and rewarding - kept a few cookies in the fridge and put the rest in the freezer. 

Such a hearty breakfast provided fuel for the rest of the day which entail-ed/s:
- watching CBS from 6-9, baking, cleaning, and relaxing while the dishwasher did its job
- mid morning nap
- depositing monies at my local CU branch
- shopping with coupons at Haggens
- easy lunch of avocado wrapped in turkey slices, carrots, kimchi, and dave&#39;s killer bread for doughy nibbles. YUM

Since then I&#39;ve been going through school stuff, deciding what stays/goes, and getting a headstart on this last book-learning quarter. Now, a walk over to Rite Aid to pick up sunscreen lotion and quarter supplies is in order before snackies...then starting a chapter or two for the cervical spine. Ah, it begins...and I refuse to use my leap second @ 4:59 pm to read!"

That&#39;s okay though, because I still have 2 blissful FULL days left on this side of the mts before I head back for Summer qtr. I can&#39;t wait to finish out the book learning, but still, I have ENJOYED my break. I can&#39;t believe it went by so fast:

Fri/Sat/Sun - blur of sleep, reading, food, and laughter. The rest of the week has dissolved into:
Movies: TH Battle of Five Armies, <span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;""> &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, and Rurouni Kenshin live action marathon (last two movies back-to-back, 7-11:30 Thurs night. Even on my laptop screen, EPIC)</span>

Off to shower, nurse all these gaping holes to at least presentable scars, and keep the metabolism low to beat this oppressive record breaking heat.

Wednesday, I said goodbye to 2014. It was a good year for so many reasons, but these make the cut:

- Prereqs at CBC
- getting last set of wisdom teeth removed
- getting accepted at WCC
- forming the 5 yr plan
- moving to Bham
= realizing I&#39;m right where I need to be and doing what I need to do to be happy

After a morning with &quot;Hunger Games&quot; (5th viewing I think?), nice lunch at home and a sunny afternoon out with family, I curled up in a heated blanket only to nod off at 9:00 pm. Read a page from a new book, fell asleep, and DID NOT wake up until 2015. 

For the first time in many years, I know exactly what I&#39;ll be doing in 2015:

- PTA school in Bham Winter, Spring, Summer qtrs
- Honing skills and confidence in my new healing craft
- &quot;30 on 30&quot; Bday celebration
- Relocation back to Sageland at the end of summer
- Fulltime clinicals in Fall 2015
- Trip back to Bham for Graduation at the end of Fall qtr
=?

That&#39;s as much as I can expect at least, but it&#39;s enough regarding consistency and normalcy, something I&#39;ve been craving since divorcing myself from the Asst. Manager workday grind that included a steady and easily anticipated schedule. 

Of course, <b><i>w</i></b><b><i>hat </i></b>will actually HAPPEN during the upcoming 360 days is the most exciting thing about any new year...and I feel this year especially. I&#39;m loving this person I&#39;m maturing into and can&#39;t wait to see where she takes me.&nbsp;"

I also washed my hands every step of the way (the way acute care practice taught me to) and thus assuaged another fear I have when handling raw meat. It&#39;s the reason why I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t do it often. I realize now how silly I&#39;ve been all these years. THAT and I&#39;ve seen my hands under blacklight AFTER implementation of proper and EFFECTIVE hand washing techniques. As long as I use those, I have no worries that I&#39;m acting as no more than a contamination surface.

Cooking forays aside, this day also sports yet another triumph: one (nearly solid) year of writing. I&#39;m almost done with my 5th story and it feels great.

WARNING: most obvious fact of the day approaching...

...wait for it...

...Tomorrow would have been 80th day of the quarter.

But thanks to awesome - in every sense of the word - instructors, this was my last day of fall quarter. For those with papers due via email or a lab practical to attend, tomorrow is the official last day. MY last day was today and thank god for it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have it in me to cram one more testable fact into my brain. After we got out of our clinical info session, I was good enough to drive downtown, share in a nice sushi meal with a very good friend, pay for overpriced chocolate, then drive friend and then myself to our respective domiciles. Now that I&#39;m here and the laundry is going, I can really believe that the quarter is over.

The REALLY unbelievable part?
NOTHING IS DUE/IN THE WORKS/ON THE BACKBURNER/CAUSING GUILT BECAUSE I&#39;M NOT DOING IT BUT REALLY SHOULD BE/BEGGING FOR ATTENTION/CAUSING HEADACHES/STRESSING ME OUT.

Cuz this week was finals week baby, and oh, yeah, it&#39;s OVER!
<strike>Kinesiology Upper Extremity Practical - Tues</strike>
<strike>Acute Care final and Lab Practical and Patho Takehome final - Wed</strike>
<strike>Burn Presentation for Patho and Kinese Final - Thurs</strike>

Next quarter: Outpatient clinical Mondays, heat/cold therapies, soft tissue mobilization, tests/measures, gait rehab...and much, much more that only 21 credits can provide. To be sure, more SPTA log entries to follow once January gets going.

The plan before that (and every good SPTA has one BEFORE they go into a situation) consists of:

1) getting laundry done so I can pack EVERYTHING that needs to come home and shutter away what doesn&#39;t
2) pack
3) watch the last eps of Fringe for season 3 so I can put THAT away and start afresh next quarter
4) unplug everything so my rented room functions as a storage unit for a month
5) <span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">pack car</span>
6) shop down south
7) see Christmas Play
8) crash at choreographer of said play&#39;s condo for a night
9) leave bright and early-ish from her place
10) drive and arrive home

I probably won&#39;t come back to this list for reference as I have done in the past, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be occupied with from now till I walk in the door of a house standing in the shadow of a hill covered in golden sagebrush.

What I&#39;m thankful for:

- Practice time for my Lab Practical(s) - Acute care required a real patient complete with a timed treatment. Kinesiology needed receptive ears to listen as well as bodies to palpate. Both were provided by my two most favorite people in the world. <span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">Sorry, while others may come close, there&#39;s no replacing mom and dad :)</span>

- Finding the peace and confidence wiithin myself to really enjoy the holiday as well as the food that we had in spades

- Friends new and old for making the holiday extra special

- Allowing myself to trade in exertions from practicing aforementioned treatments and house cleaning as exercise time. The bathroom floor is sparkling, the carpets are clean, and I am just as content to let them be so WITHOUT making myself exhausted ontop of it. 

- A finals week that is capped off with seeing my best bud&#39;s success at being a first-time choreographer, AND heading home for a month of relaxation, BBT, and more muscle learning.

All that remains is to eat, sleep, and study my way through this week. Thursday will be a short day (no lab, so off at noon!) and I&#39;m planning to use it to close up shop here on this side of the mountains. Friday I&#39;ll hang the &quot;back in January&quot; sign on my door and start the fun trek back home. Saturday I&#39;ll be there, drop my bags, and sleep for a week ;) &nbsp;&nbsp;"

I took time out by making little time this weekend for fun at the cinema today. Icon and title of post should be clues enough, but if I need to hit you over the head with it, then alright - 

MOCKINGJAY PART 1!

20 people in the theatre that could hold 100x more than that. Me in my own row, in the perfect spot with respectful fellow patrons. What did it all come down to?

Good acting (love Jlaw more now), beautiful effects, and a haunting melody. ALL of these things couldn&#39;t drown out the persistant whine of denial that I have to wait a friggin year for the finale. 

If you&#39;ve never read the books, there&#39;s some pretty scenes and a lot of waiting around. There&#39;s not real &quot;CLIMAX&quot; of action, except at the very end where it feels more like you&#39;re winding down a dark rabbit hole. I understand what film critics are saying, that &quot;It doesn&#39;t go anywhere&quot; and this movie just &quot;sets the table but doesn&#39;t bring out the main course&quot;. That&#39;s the problem with bisecting 1 book straight down the middle. 

We got some tasty appetizers though. For fans of the BOOK there were plenty of things to snack on. I went into the experience wanting to see just a few items that I felt the director would be amiss if he didn&#39;t address (there&#39;s still some teeth gnashing over character development from the last movie...makes my jaw ache). I got them all, plus some (didn&#39;t know how far they&#39;d take a few scenes and how well they fleshed out some that were just alluded to in the book). I felt for every single character but was really taken with Josh&#39;s performance as Peeta. He used what precious little screentime he had to emote. For fans of the book, Josh Hutcherson started out as a poor choice for Peeta. There was some level of rebellion in the streets when that little guy from a bunch of sleeper hits ascended the stairs at the reaping. Peeta&#39;s supposed to be big, able to chuck sacks of flour like they were hackey sacks. But he&#39;s got that warmth that draws people to him. That&#39;s what Josh nailed then, did it again in Catching Fire, and now through Capitol transmissions. I nearly cried. 

Afterwards, I walked out of the theatre and straight back into reality: finals in 2 wks, presentations, stresses, feeling overwhelmed and helpless. A trip to the grocery store cheered me up and after checking off something ELSE on the list, I treated myself to BBT. I&#39;m still a bit wired and though it&#39;s late (for me, kids) I&#39;ll probably work on getting a start in another subject.

THEN dream of all that&#39;s to come...Real or not real? &nbsp;"

"event","wow.... this feels weird. i haven't posted in such a long time. lost of stuff has come and gone. some good and some bad. I miss Bradenton and it's drama. My sister keeps me up-to-date on the good shit. and this week.... there was some gooooood shit. FIRST OFF... what the hell were you thinking? im sure that this comment knows where it is directed. some advice... don't hurt the people who are closest to you. if you say someone is your ""friend"", ACT LIKE IT. Think before you act and if you aren't thinking, well that's just dumb. I know I really shouldn't be getting involved, but it does deal with my sister, whom i REALLY TRUTHFULLY care about. She is NOT fake. She is REAL. Maybe one of the most REAL people you will ever meet. She would never hurt her friends the way they hurt her. I feel so bad for her and all the shit that she has been through. She gives people more than 1 chance and people continue to walk all over her. Life isn't fair, and you can't change what has already happened. maybe next time you should try and think about someone other than yourself. one word will sum up my whole lecture.... SHADY!"

"event","well im not very good at writing on here. i mostly get on and read everyone else's problems and laugh at all the time people spend being dramatic and ridiculous. I think it's so funny how people use LJ to talk shit about other people. especially the good old 'annonymous' posts. if u can't back up what you are saying then u really don't mean it. grow up people. if u have to use LJ to tell someone u have beef, then ur a fucking pussy. stop 'acting' like you are the shit. i am really pessimistic about this whole live journal thing. i think people are abusing what it is intended for. it's a journal... hence the name. it is not a place for immature people to talk shit about enemies. (or people they are envious of) this town is full of dramatic people who claim to ""hate"" drama. ha bullshit. the drama in this town is like a fucking plague. it's so contagious. so for the few people who actually use LJ the right way, thank you and keep doing so. For the other 'kids', i have some advice... GROW UP, please."

"event","so yesterday was Father's Day. Should have been family reunion day over at grandma/grandpa Davila's house. I saw some cousins i haven't seen in a while! I think there was like 20 of us in this small ass condo on the golf course. They live in Ocala in a retirement community called 'The Villages'. 
   OKAY, so my WHOLE family is FAT! i was surpirsed that there was water still in the damn pool after we all went swimming. wow. it was nice seeing everyone, but i was definately ready to go home. talk about a long day! woke up at freakin 8am to drive there. then we didn't get home til like 10:30pm. Put in some good quality family time. so i should be okay to miss the next couple family functions for a while, and not feel so guilty! 
   So after 'OLD FOLK TOWN', me nicole and will went to Mark B's b'day bash. Nicole fell in love (SHOCKER) with a boy from the PHILOPINES nicknamed 'Crazy Horse'. that was actually his middle name..(no joke). so everyone is drunk/high/just all fucked up, but im too lame to have fun anymore. I wish someone would just have a fucking BASH n everyone could just relax n get real shitty. and im not talking about a fuckin highschool party. that's all there is in this damn town. Hell i hang out with my dogs b/c there aint shit to do here. I guess some things never change. ok enough of my bitching about being bored, hopefully i will find something fun to do. PEACE OUT MOTHA FUCKA!"

"event","so today is boring. kinda like every other day here back in good ol' bradenton. i miss courtney and niki. so basically i have no one here but will. i mean that's not a bad thing, at least i have him! my family has been driving me nuts lately. i am starting to realize that living in gville isn't so bad. 1. i don't live with my family, 2. i can do whatever i want. 3. i don't have to answer to anyone! haha so basically i am looking forward to Fall! and turning 21. you can't do shit unless you are 21. man we went to ybor the other night. me,nicole, pee pee, stephanie, and shannon and let me tell you, that was the WORST experience i have ever had at the Castle. usually the people there are really nice, well we must have went to 'be a dick night' b/c everyone was such asses! so we left n we were walkin around ybor pissed off n bored, so we went to this booty dancing club called HETO. hell, i have never even heard of that place, but the club promoter hooked us up. I guess it was a double club night, meaning that you could also get into the Amphitheater. WOW. the line was SOOOO LONG! so this other club promoter TOTALLY hooked us up n walked us up to the front!! i guess it pays to be with a group of young girls! we were like beggin the guy to hook us up with some H2O b/c we were like DYING of thirst! so he did! haha. it was cool has hell. then we decided to go dance n there was a CIRCULATING DANCE FLOOR! talk about pimp! haha we all were hot n tired n had to pee so we went to the little girls room and as we were walking out we saw a bunch of B'town girls and had a little MHS reunion right there in the hall way. haha everyone was getting pissed at us b/c we were blocking the path to the shitter! oh well.. so after that we were like ok it's almost 2 we should prob start heading to the car. so that was pretty much the end of the night besides driving around lookin for a place to get a friggin drink at 2am. GOOD LUCK TRYING TO DO THAT! finally 7-11 in Brandon was open n we got like 323098 gatorades n waters hah. it was fun tho! i was soo tired the next day. we wanted to have a good time b4 everyone left. well not nicole and i haha ... steph to UCF, Shan to UF, and Pee Pee aka Lindsey G was going to her summer house in Washington. so we pretty much made the best of it. ok enough said. ADIOS AMIGOS"

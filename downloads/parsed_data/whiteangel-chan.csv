In better news, my school refund check has come in so my bills can finally be paid from Christmas. That was the first time I'd ever maxed out my credit card, and something I hope to not do again anytime soon.

Also, in case I haven't mentioned it before, I caved to the pressure and have been watching Avatar. Am halfway through the 3rd season and would be finishing it were it not for the pile of crap I have to do.

Christmas break was mostly spent killing zombies and busting ghosts as I was reuinited with my xbox, which I had greatly missed. Sadly, said reunion is already over and I won't be touching the dear machine til May. Heartbreaking, considering the arrival of Final Fantasy XIII in the spring.

Fandom-wise, I recieved the DS Kingdom hearts game, but as of now have not yet had a chance to play it. I've been catching up with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and my love for FMA is freshly renewed. <3

Also Hetalia. I loves it. :D

I've read the first 2 books of the Twilight series and still do not understand the appeal. The characters are shitty and flat. But I am a completist and since I've started, I have to finish the damn series.

My MP3 players keep meeting with tragedy. My original creative zen (a monster of a player dubbed Jack) finally became a victim of his age (5 years) and suffered a stroke. His memory remains intact, but his buttons don't work. Then I got a Zune, Jack Jr., who within months went retarded and couldn't remember shit. Seriously, he would forget what song he was playing in the middle of it. He got shipped off to the the crazy house curtesy of my warranty and was replaced with Jack, III. All went well for Jack, III until my sister borrowed him and then sat on him...He still functions, but is in a delicate state, the poor boy. His frame is all cracked and superglued. And my warranty is likely voided, damnit. :(

Am in my last semester of classes in pharm school, and I have a huge ass presentation to do. Really need to get on that, as it will be due before I know it. My topic, the safety and efficacy of continous use oral contraceptives. Sounds like a real gas, amirite?

Also, not much of a football fan as a rule, but feel compelled to give a little ""Whoo!"" for my home team making it to the superbowl. Gotta say, never thought it would happen. If they win, be ready for the impending apocalypse."

Anyway, news update:
-spent July working in a hospital pharmacy rotation. What did I learn in those 4 weeks? Simply this - hospitals are le suck.
-deflowered the xbox. Spent much of the summer in passionate throws of Dead Rising, Ninga Gaiden II, and Resident Evil 5. And some Oblivion, but Oblivion is a needy whore who demands way too much time.
-Also dove into Devil May Cry and wondered what took me so long to do so. Finished the first one, started the 2nd but couldn't get into it, and have moved onto the 3rd, which I will never finish before school starts.
-School starts, btw, on Monday
-Mum's house has become a kitten factory once again. She was good, had all her cats fixed, but her house is a <s>pussy</s> feline magnet and another calico managed to show up, have TWO litters, and then disappear before the last ones were even weaned. So, eight kittens richer, mum is bit beside herself. Throw in my grandmother's progessing senility and my sister starting to date, and she is ready to shoot herself.
-Am worried that I've started to forget how to draw. Took the Wacom out a few times <s>and pirated a copy of photoshop</s> but I want to get back to using my prismas. Don't know what I want to draw, though...I had a gothic Alice in Wonderland scene planned, but the approaching Tim Burton version makes me feel somewhat hack-ish to do that. Even though I would have made the Hatter much sexier than Depp did. (Good god, he is frightening in that getup)
-Am broke until the school decides to hand over my loan moneys
-And despite my clever hiding place, my cats have stolen my toothbrush and are now batting to each other across my bathroom floor...good chance I have a spare"

Within the hour, it's all over the news, local and national. My phone metaphorically rings off the hook and all day it's all I've heard. It was rather surreal at first. Oh wow, that's my old school. But quickly it developed into me just seeing it as being blown completely out of proportion. Everyone is spreading rumors when they don't really know anything. People are freaking out. It wasn't a Columbine by any means. It could have been bad, yes, but really, chill the fuck out. Its the reality of today, and no one was killed, so tone down the drama, please.

For me this just rings home the fact that teachers are not adequately paid for the danger level of their profession."

I finally got to pop the plastic on my xbox, which was bought back in March. Tis the Resident Evil elite edition, and I have dubbed it The Baron, on account of it's red. Spent one day fighting with getting xbox live to work. Spent another day fighting with getting the disc to cooperate (apparently the RE game has a tendancy to be flakey). But worth it, OMG, so worth it. RE 4 was my favorite game, period, and RE 5 picks up where 4 left off and the co-op is just so freaking awsome. Spent the better part of today playing with a friend who was 350 miles away, no lag. I'm greatly impressed thus far.

Also made of win this week was Star Trek. I was never a trekkie. In fact, I hated it when growing up, since Tou-san was indeed a trekkie and watched it all the time, boring the hell out of my childhood self. But I quite enjoyed the movie. Much more than I was expecting too. Really liked the way it all pulled together. Tomorrow I may be spending some time at the theater again. Possibly Wolverine and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (obligatory chick-flick with my more feminine friends)."

Devil May Cry, on the other hand, is not disappointing. Sexy main character with a sword <em>AND</em> guns who seems to be constantly getting <em>impaled</em>? Plus RPG style leveling and non-polygon graphics despite being an older game? Oh yeah. I'm there. I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I'm going to like this series."

Bleh, I planned to get a couple books read, play through a few games, finish watching my Bleach dvds and season 2 of Dexter., and maybe write a little fanfiction...All I managed to do was read Coraline and half of Brisinger and finish Final Fantasy XII (finally!!)&nbsp;and start Re:Chain of Memories. Because, once again, I&nbsp;spent more time at the parents place than I&nbsp;originally intended and in the interest of light packing, did not bring many books, games, etc. 

I should at least finish Sora's section in Re:CoM before school starts again on Monday. It plays very similar to the gameboy version (including the tedious battles and required constant leveling that prevent me from marathon play like I did with KH 1 and 2). On that note. hurling keyblades is awesome, Marluxia is way more effiminate than I remember him being (OMG that is very pink hair...), and Repliku is a major bitch.

My brain wants to cross Kingdom Hearts with Princess Tutu. I&nbsp;keep telling it no, but it will not listen. Mytho was scary enough without add heartless/nobody versions of him to the mix.

Ah, other catch up new....Got a Garmin and a new camera for Christmas as well as an assload of drawing books and The Complete Sandman vol 1 and 2. Saw Benjamin Buton over the break and rather liked it. Bride Wars was OK, but&nbsp; not one I'd particularly like to see again. And I saw The Unborn earlier tonight and laughed my ass off.

I could have done better if I really tried, but my giveafuck has been broken since September.

On another note, remember that fanart that was floating around a few months back featuring The Simpsons and Futurama done in anime and the one that followed of Death Note in Simpsons style? Well, the girl who did that apparently got a job because of it and was featured in the Treehouse of Horrors edition of the Simpsons comic this month.

So. School remains all consuming. I've found a healthy balance between stressing out and complete indifference that leaves me passing but not maxing out my potential. But no worries b/c...no worries. Much rather take the lower-but-still-passing grade and miss out on all the stress. We all get the same degree in the end, so it doesn't matter if I get A's or C's.

Got a 2nd kitty. A little grey boy that has been dubbed Sage. He's a needy little thing but affectionate. I got him partly as a means of getting Mimi to bite less, which has worked.

Searched 'em, edited 'em, uploaded 'em, and organized 'em all in one sitting, knowing that if I didn't do them now, I would simply use them as a procrastination tool later on. And for every single mood as well - no two have the same image. Which ended up being, like 131 or something. x_X<br /><br />My intention was to stay up all night and day so that I could go to bed early tonight and get back on a school schedule, but I forgot the roast of Bob Saget was tonight and I definatly want to watch that. So I will propbably be going to bed shortly for at least a little while so that I'll be conscious during it.<br /><br />Watching Steel Magnolias as I'm sitting here finishing up.

Woe is me, for after a persistant itch to replay pokemon only to discover that my Gold version had slipped into senility and could no longer remember its saved data, I finally perchased a nintendo ds and diamond version. I had hoped that there would be some means of saving my dear pokes still on my silver version, which has resisted the senility but surely hasn't much time left. However, it seems this is an imposiblity, as all my sources claim that there is no possible combination of game versions and trading which might rescue my childhood friends from their cruel fate... Damn you GBA versions and your lack of backward compatibility! Whyever would I want FireRed or Leaf Green when I mastered the first red and blue? I do not want to re-capture all those 200+ creatures and I especially do not want to train them all yet again!

Really, its the loss of my 17 maxed out level 100s that pains me so ( I really never cared about that damned pokedex or its completion). Especially my dearest Mew, who was always my favorite and was obtained at a pittiling level 5 and trained all the way to 100... *sigh* I do not want to wait around and then battle 9 year olds in order to obtain another...

You broke my heart, nintendo. I mourn the loss of the fruits of my efforts."

The masochistic part of me however, is curious to see which actors they would choose. I don't think that they could possibly find anyone better than Kenichi to play L (although a young Johnny Depp would have been close, but he's too old now)and Papa Yamgami was also very well done, but there was room for improvement elsewhere, particularly with Light. Just so long as they don't get that Disney-esque kid to play him. I know everyone says he looks the part, but I would not be able to acept that... Though I honestly don't know enough of the young actors to be able to make a good suggestion. :/ <br /><br />Maybe Gaspard Ulliel (aka young Hannibal Lecter) as Light? He's got the inteligent/sophisticated yet evil/corrupted thing down and it wouldn't be hard for him to get the look. That could work, methinks...<br /><br />Though if Hilary Duff, Linsey Lohan, Paris Hilton, or any of that ilk play Misa, I'm boycotting on principle."

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""In which I drone on about the Death Note movie dub, Princess Tutu, and fics I will never get around to writing..."">Though I usually prefer sub to dub as a rule, I did enjoy the Death Note movie premier and forced it upon a couple of my friends. Both said friends favored Light (guys, pfft) and I argued with them all the way home about L's obvious superiority. XP Had to drive practically to New Orleans to find a theater that showed it and while the extra footage was weak, I was not disappointed. Hearing Ryuk tell Light he was screwed and in deep shit was worth it alone. I was in half-hearted Mikami-esque garb and there were a few Light cosplayers in the crowd, but the audience almost ruined the experience. There was a really loud group in the front that were constantly conversing and laughing inappropriately and a girl just a few seats from us who INSISTED on talking on her cell phone during the movie. I'm all for fun, but not when it's dancing in the realm of obnoxiousness.<br /><br />Also watching the movie after having read Another Note has got my conspiracy gears turning. L's room number was 1302, I noted. 13 looks like B when you scrunch it and 02 being B, the second letter of the alphabet. XD I wanna go back to the manga and see if there's anything else like that which I may be able to work into a fic. A BB fic has been poking holes in my brain and begging me to find the motivation to write.<br /><br />Also began watching Princess TuTu. I'm not overly fond of the animation style, but it's growing on me. The dub is also actually pretty good. And the extras are absolute hilarity. Particularly the VA commentary and the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3ntFSG-Y2k&amp;feature=related"">outtakes</a> - the voice actors have a great sense of humor. Fakir's voice actor is well aware of how gay his scenes with Mytho come off. I laughed my ass off.</div><br /><br />As for the story I dont think I'm far enough in for a fair opinion. Right now it reminds me not unfavorably of Fruits Basket.<br /><br />Internet at Tou-san's blows. I miss my wireless. Won't have it back til July. :("

(And I do not mean Billy Bob Thorton among the dub voice actors...) Seems ole' Neil Gaiman had a hand in the dub. As in, he developed the dialogue from the translation.<br /><br />Doubtless, you all knew this already, as am fairly a noob with it comes to Miyazaki films. But when this sort of thing happens, it just makes me tilt my head to the side and go ""hrrmmm..."" in&nbsp;a thoughtful fashion. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the natural meshings of my fandoms are rare, but it always takes me a bit by surprise when I see a familiar face in unfamiliar territory or vice versa.

I know it's not distance, since people&nbsp;from New York are battleing&nbsp;people&nbsp;in Arizona and having no issues. My wireless has excellant connectivity, so it isn't that either. It's not possible for me to connect the net directly, as it's in a different room.

Incedently, my friend code is&nbsp;5155-2628-0037. Add me? :D"

"event","&nbsp;Ordered some art supplies the other day becaue ASW express had a really good sale on prismacolor pencils and I wanted the updated colors. Also ordered some matboard, because that's what I draw on. Now, issues with the matboard...
On the one hand, they were MUCH cheaper online. I paid about eight bucks a sheet (32"" x 40""). Michaels wanted 40$ for a full sheet. I ordered five sheets. They sent 10...was not charged for these extra sheets....However, nearly all of them are damaged in varying degrees: bent, dirty, scratched, wetspots, etc. I cut the sheets, so it's not like they're unusable, but still....
I guess the extras make up for the damage, but if I had needed the full sheet, I'd be rather irked...

Despite venturing into digital media, I don't wanna give up on traditional.

Just really wish I had more time to draw. Freakin' tests...*pout*"

"event","&nbsp;What part of ""I get faint when you talk about it as you are drawing the blood"" is not understandable? If a translation is need, then what I mean is that it is most unhelpful if you jaw on about how you thought you had the vein, but apparently not and how slow a bleeder I am wilst the needle is in my arm. The process is much quicker if you just allow me to look away and find my happy place while you do what needs to be done. That half an hour I spent lying down on your couch until the signs of impending loss of consciousness could have been better spent.

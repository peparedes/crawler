"event","Wow, it has been almost two months since I updated here. Cory finished basic and graduated with the Academic Award of Excellence. My Sailor is so smart. He is now in Groton, CT and is starting sub school in the next week or so. Sub school is only 8 weeks long, but then his A school is also in CT and is nearly 10 months long. So I guess I am on my own for a while. 

My trip to Chicago to see him graduate was wonderful. We spent the first day in the city doing a ton of site seeing things. We went to the aquarium, the museum of history and also the planitarium. We took the ferry from the Navy peir to the other side of town. The second day we spent in. It was so hot outside, so when we checked into the hotel room we just hung out there. We went to I-Hop for lunch (mmm...pancakes) and then Outback for dinner. The last day we went back into the city in the morning, we ate breakfast in the city and then saw the Broadway show Stomp. It was awesome.

"event","I am so sorry that I suck at updating this thing. I am going to try to give you a bit of an update right now:
I am busy working with Brandy today; however, I will be done at noon and Cory will be getting back from the vet office at about 1:30. I love hanging out with him. We are picking up our paychecks early tomorrow so we can pay rent on time. :( I hate money. The animals are all wonderful. I converted our huge walk in closet into a cat room. They love it. There is some cleaning up that needs to be done around the house. I had every intention on taking out the trash this morning, but that was before Sadie was let out to puke, with me in a towel, and my neighbor walking his shepard who Sadie has fought in the past. I was in my towel and robe for that ordeal. Needless to say, the trash did not get taken out this morning. I think I am going to take a nap when I get home and then Cory and I will hang out all day!! I got another dog for the rescue. My friend Mollie turned over her English Bulldog Tyson. She was too nervous about him with the baby. Oh well. School is going ok. I took a test on Saturday during adoptions and get an 80% on it. Not too bad for someone who read only the first 3 pages of the text. Cory and I will be going to the court house tomorrow to fill out the marriage license and then next Wednesday we are actually signing it at the court house. I am really excited about that. My friend James is going to take pictures for us afterwards at Kanapaha Botanitcal gardens. :) Have I mentioned that I offically hate money? It runs everything. Moving on, my Dad's birthday is today: Happy Birthday Daddy, and mine is tomorrow. How exciting. Well I guess that is everything. I need to get off so I can write up some kind of case notes for work so I can actually get paid tomorrow. Got to love work! Blah.

Have a wonderful day."

Roman is an 11 week old chihuahua. He is 2lbs 3ounces, and is just adorable. He is learning some manners such as playing nicely with the cats, sharing his mommy, and also working on his food aggression towards the other animals. Here is a picture of him.

"event","Well I am just in a pretty sad mood tonight. Yesterday Cory and I went out to this woman's horse farm. She has 16 horses and 21 acres. On her land she had an itty bitty trailor that she doesn't use, so we prompted her about if she would be willing to rent it out. She got really excited about it, as did I, but she said that she would have to go talk about all this with her mom since this is her land and everything. I said wonderful. Meanwhile, I am extremly excited about ti since it would be a spectacular opportunity for us to move out of our apartment. She (Peggy) was saying how she had always thought about renting it out, but never got around to doing the repairs on the place. Cory and I both agreed that we would come out there and help with whatever needed to be done. We figure that if this all works out we will have really cheap rent, and we would also be able to work some of the rent off helping around the farm.

So everyone who knows me knows that I am super excited about this already. Today I gave her a call to decide when to go down and talk to her mom about it. We decided on Monday, but she just did not seem as enthusiastic about it as she did on Wednesday. It totally bummed me out. I so badly want this. I am also looking for other trailors that are in better condition and maybe talk to her mom about moving it onto the property with the hookups. Maybe she would then let us live there rent free and I would just give her the trailor when I moved out. 

Peggy also said today that she did not know how expensive all the repairs are going to be. So on Monday we will have to sit down and try to figure out some numbers. Maybe it just might be cheaper to get a newer trailor that is in better condition. We will have to consider that as an option as well. There is so much that needs to go into this, and I think I am just getting nervous that it will fall through. I think the reason that I am so nervous about it, is because at the same time I am beyond excited if this will work out. She knows about all the cats, and the dog and she is perfectly fine about it, I mean this is a farm, lol. Just everyone keep us in your prayers. I would love (LOVE) for this to work out. 

Another thing that I got super bummed about today was the idea of losing one of my animals. I mean I have 6, which are just the center of my world. But as happy as they make me know, it will just crush me when one of them goes. I cannot imagine any of my babies passing. I love them all so much. I just do not think I am strong enough to lose one of my babies. I love them all."

I am working with Brandy now at SFCC. I was suppose to work with Miracle at 4, but her mom canceled. She has some kind of meeting so Sean will be with the kids today. It will nice to be home at 4, except for the fact that Cory is working. :(

I will be home all alone, and Gilmore Girls is not even on! Cory downloaded Tristan and Isolde for me. Beth said that it was wonderful, just as good as The Notebook. Can you believe it? Well I will post a followup after the movie today. I am excited that now I have my evening to watch it. :) 

I am going to start some good walks with Sadie. When I get home today (after Oprah), I am going to try taking Sadie for a 45 minute walk. This is something that Ceaser Milan (the dog whisperer) recommends. I will see how this helps her behavior for this evening. I am busy trying to plan Keri's birthday present, as well as my Mom's suprise party. We figure there are about 50 people that we are inviting. It should be awesome.

My dad is taking my mom away for the weekend, and they will be back on March 12, which is when the party is being planned for. We are planning on a salad from Crispers as well as sandwhiches. We will of course have Bru's wings, and some homemade meatballs. I need to get that recipe. I need to get a hold of my dad so I can figure out if we will be setting up tables outside. I think that would be nice. I could rent some table cloths and make some flower center pieces. I also need my dad to check out the audio stuff to make sure it is working. I think I am going to have Chris Botti's CDs playing.

Let me know if anyone has any advice."

I set up a nice fish tank in our bedroom yesterday. Gail had one at her house and was not using it. So now we have one in the living room, as well as one in the bedroom. How pretty. The one in the living room in community tropical fish, but the one that is in the bedroom will probably be semi aggressive tropical fish.

"event","Courtesy of Naomi, I have decided to post mine and Cory's love story.

Summe of 2001 a friend of mine Ashley Trott invited me to go to church with her for a fun volleyball game. (You know how us volleyball players are, you don't have to ask us twice.) So we went and had fun playing volleyball with the youth group. I met a group of wonderful people and decided I needed to go back next week. The next Wednesday (?) arrived and the youth group took a trip to the beach. I had opted against bringing my bathing suit, because that just was not happening; however, as it turned out, I wanted to go in. Tank top and soffee shorts I was swimming in the ocean with my friend Liz. 

What else do high school girls do besides finds the high school boys. Our boy radar spotted them, and we swam over to this group of guys in the ocean. The guys were Matt, Tom, Mike, Justin as well as Cory and they turned out to be with the youth group and super sweet. We hung out with them for the remaining part of the evening. 

They summer flew by and I was attending the youth group each week as well as the Sunday morning service. Cory's 17th birthday arrived, and people were throwing him a suprise birthday. I decided not to go, because we just never really hit it off. 

9/11 hit, and that is when Cory and I really hit it off. We met eachother right after it happened in the hall ways as classes were changing and talked the whole way to class. I, however, was seeing Justin at the time. Nothing really happened with us, but Cory was there during the break up to stand by me. He was wonderful. I think that is how you know you can love someone, when they have stood by your side as a friend. Cory and I started talking all the time, before school, after school, on the phone. We decided to hang out for the first time on Halloween. He came over to my house and we watched Hannibel (WHY?!?). 

The following weekend was Homecoming, and he already had a date, so I went alone. We did pictures before hand at the Youth Pastors house, and we took a limo to the dance. To my pleasant suprise, Cory was spending much more time with me then he was with his date. We took formal pictures together and had a wonderful evening. 

A month to the day later Cory asked me to be his girlfriend. I was elated. That was a Tuesday and our first date was on a Friday, he packed us a picnic. We walked to the nearby park ate our supper, and oh man, did we kiss like crazy. We both just knew there was something so special. We also attended a Christmas dance together down at the beach.
<img src=""http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e27/mrosevesey/ChristmasDance2001.jpg"" />

We proceeded to be by eachother's side for the remainder of his senior year. We went on skitrip together, that was a huge trip for us, because only a month into our relatiohsip we were deciding what we were going to do when Cory went off to college the following August. We just knew this was going to last. <img src=""http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e27/mrosevesey/SkiTripJan2002.jpg"" /> We had a blast at the beach where we met on Valentine's day, we had an amazing time at my 1950's sock hop sweet 16, and then there was prom. It was all so wonderful. 
<img src=""http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e27/mrosevesey/prom2002.jpg"" />

Cory and I had to physically seperate for the summer. I went to camp, he went to some secular college camp, and then I got back with just enough time to say goodbye to him for college. Meanwhile, we were still a couple, still Cory and Meg. We had made it, there were bumps thoughout the summer, but always went back to one another. Cory and I did not see eachother until Thanksgiving, and then Christmas, and then his spring semester he started coming home nearly every weekend. He continued to come home every weekend until I went up to college in Jan. of 2004. We had an awesome time at my senior homecoming. That was just a fun night for us, we stayed with a bunch of friends at a hotel on the beach together! <img src=""http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e27/mrosevesey/Homecoming2003.jpg"" /> We went to camp summer of 2003 together, we stayed home together summer of 2004, and we stood by eachother side. 

When I started in college, I decided to visit him every other weekend. The boys dorms are so scary girls, I am warning you all. We continued seeing eachother this way until summer came and we went home. We spent all summer of 2004 together, doing what college kids do in the summer. It was not until Cory birthday dinner came up did everything change. We had to celebrate his birthday early. His actual birthday was on Aug 20, but we were going to dinner Aug 7 since he would be leaving for college before his bday. We went to our restaurant, La Veranda. We had a wonderful dinner, he seemed a bit nervous looking back on it, but nothing too weird. He had been telling me all along that he had a suprise for me on Sunday, but this was Saturday and we were celebrating his birthday! 

Cory decided we should walk on the beach after our meal, so to Atlantic beach we went. There was a lighthouse, and Cory said he didn't see it. So as I was staring at it every time it would come around I would say did you see it, he said no, and then again, he said no. This time I was angry, what was wrong with him, how could h not see it. So I turned around, and there he was on one knee. He asked me to marry him, and I of course said yes. We were both so excited!

It is now Feb of 2006, and we are still not married. That is because my parents think it would be best to wait, but in our eyes we are husband and wife. We moved into our first apartment together in Aug, and live with our fur babies. We are more in love now than every. 

Here are just some more pictures of us together.

I am working a 7 hour day today, but I am sure it could be worse. I have a ton of cleaning to do in the house when I get home. Not fun. 

Cory and I will have dinner at home tonight followed probably by a movie. 

I leave tomorrow afternoon to drive to Orlando to meet mi mama!"

"event","I had a wonderful nap today. Cory and I both worked together, and then after we were done with our clients we hoped into bed for a nap. It was us and all the kitters. :) I am so excited that he is now working with Cooperative Adventure. He is going to keep working for Dominos on the weekends, since that is when he gets the most cash. During the week he is going to have clients at Cooperative Adventure like I do, and we will get to do things together. Today we went bowling with our clients, and then had lunch all together. 

It is amazing when things get answered. I prayed that Cory would get a job that would make him happy, and this just popped up! We are so happy. 

I made little Valentine's day presents for all the Animal People Inc. volunteers, as well as my bosses at Cooperative Adventure. This is what they look like.

"event","Hello Everyone. I had a wonderful day today. I worked for only 3 hours, and then got to spend the day with Cory. We hung around the house, and read some. We then picked up his pay check from work, and ate dinner at Sonnys. YUMMY! King of Queens is on right now, and then 7th Heaven. I am pretty sad that this is the show's last season.

All the animals are doing wonderfully. Maximus and Moses are on top of the crate snoozing. Kiwi is running around terrorizing everything. And the infamous black boys are sleeping I think on the cat condo. 

Cory and I are doing super. Cory is going to be taking a job at Cooperative Adventure, which is where I work. He will also work at Dominos on the weekend. It will be less stressful then doing Dominos 50 hours a week. We are excited, especially since we will be able to have dinner together each night."

"event","Another Saturday, another day of adoptions. So this is the way it seems to be. I went down to Gail's on Thursday and I got to start my quilt. I also helped her clean her Mom's stuff out of her Dad's house, since she passed away a week ago.It ended up being so late I just stayed down in Fort McCoy. I helped out with the dogs, worked a ton on my quilt, and picked up her Dad from the airport. I will post some pictutres of my quilt probably later today. I should have it completed by next weekend. :) 

All the babies are doing well. I got a new coller for Gibbly with hopes that I might be able to tell them apart, but it doesn't help too much since they are both so long haired. Sadie has been good. I am picking up a pinch coller today for her from Gail with hopes to break her fixation on sometimes the cats, but also the animals that are walking behind our apartment. 

I guess I should take the dog out, and scoop the boxes before I have animals peeing in the house. I need to get ready for adoptions also. I hope everyone have a good Saturday."

We have one possible adoption for today, and it is a little Pit Bull named Reeka. Hopefully she finds a home today. We are also planning on starting my quilt. I am going to be cranking that sucker out. I would love for it to be done in time for me to bring it to Orlando. I doubt it, but I am trying to stay hopefuly. If anything, it will at least be done by the time we head home for the engagement party. I will take some pictures of the litter of puppies that we have, as well as the two cats that we are babysitting to send to their Mommy. 

I slept super soundly last night. It was wonderful. I think I am going on strike from staightening my hair today, it looks like a hat day if you ask me."

I am so excited about that. I am hoping that I can get it done in time to go see my mom in Orlando on the 15th. I know that is really fast, but I am thinking that if I am able to get all the t-shirts sewed together by Saturday morning then it might be possibly. Lets keep our fingers crossed for that. I am hoping that it will be a queen size, I will need to cut all the shirts to figure that out. Does anybody have a choice of color for the backing sheet? I am planning on checking out Ross to decide what is cheap, lol. 

Ok, well I am going to head to work."

"event","Well today I am off from both work and from adoptions. I love getting a spontaneous day off every once in a while. I did not sleep well last night at all. I have no idea why. :( I will probably take a nap today because my shows are on tonight! Extreme Home Makeover will be just awesome. 

We are having some issues with Sadie. She is going after the two new black boys. She has growled at them, barked, and even mouthed at them. So we decided that we should put her in her crate at night, but last night we did and not even after 5 minutes of her being in there was she barking and growling at the cats. We had no choice but to crate her in the bathroon. We threw an old comforter on the floor and she was fine, but I just feel bad. I am going to talk to Gail about it when I get a chance. I do not think that it is the black boys that caused this, because I had seen her mouth at Paxer more than once and she does this all unprovoked. We will work something out so everyone is happy.

All the cats are doing well. Revol and Gibbly feel that it is their job to sleep with us at night. It is getting old real fast. When they do this they pin us down and I can't even move the comforter. (Part of my not sleeping well last night). Max is doing wonderful, I got a full half an hour of Paxer loving yesterday when I was in bed reading. He just parked himself right on my chest. He is super sweet when he wants to be. Moses is being bad as usually. We bought something yesterday and it was in a big box so Cory carried it up, and before I could get in from taking Sadie for a walk Moses was planted right on top looking like ""thanks Mom, I needed a new podium."" Odd little bugger. Our Kiwi girl is doing well also. She has gotten into this bad habbit of attacking my feet, but she is just playing and asking for attention. It hurts though, lol.

Other than all that not too much is going on. Cory is doing well. I just love him. Even when we get into stupid little spats about nothing, I can still just think about how much I love him. He is wonderful.

That's all for now."

"event","I just wanted to throw in a little up date before I head off to adoptions. We have adoptions today from 11-6. I have been so freaking busy with work it is just unreal. I work about 6 days a week. I think I am getting close to 40 hours a week, which is what I need, but it sucks. I think I might have figured out how to add some pictures into the journal, so I will insert some of our babies if it lets me. Cory and I bought a few movies yesterday: Batman Begins, Mr and Mrs Smith, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (that one is mine :)). I watch the Sisterhood last night, it was very cute. So after adoptions today I have to work with one of my clients. Yesterday I worked with one client from 9-3 and then I went to the office until 6:30, then I picked up another client and took him to the gymnastics meet. 

I wish I could just work doing animal adoptions and that be it, wouldn't that be nice? Cory has been really grouchy the last few days. He too is sick of work. He is going to start looking for a job as a vet tech on his next day off. Everyone pray that he finds one soon. We end up fighting about the stupidist shit because he is too tired. Yesterday we fought because I was running late for work, and the dog needed a walk. Today we fought because I needed help changing the boxes, and it needed to be done this morning, not this evening. So lets all hope he finds a new job ASAP.

We went down to Paynes Praire the other day, but the sun was just too harsh to get any god pictures. We will probably try that again on our next day off. Cory needs to get a hair cut, and then we might do some pictures of the two of us. We need some nice new ones. Other than work there has not been too much going on. I will get to see my Mom in Feb, we are meeting in Orlando. Then Cory and I will both be going home in March for Chris and Angie's engagement party, as well as my Mom's 50th birthday. That is when I am bringing little Rummy home to my parents.

I need to head off to adoptions. Wish me luck finding some good homes today.

No luck with the pictures. It is a paid feature only. :("

Payton
Sweet little Payton Freeman passed away last Sunday. He was the reason for Payton's Pals, the non for profit organization raising money to fight the awful disease of Spinal Muscular Atrophy. He was 5 years young when he passed. I found out on Monday at 1 and headed straight home. I just got back up to Gainesville this afternoon. Everything was beautiful. It is just hard when someone so young dies. The fight will go on, in Payton and the thousands of other children's memories.

A cure will be found.

Panera
Cory and I are getting ready to head over to Panera Bread for lunch. I joined a gym on Monday, and have worked out already three times. I feel great. I have done weights twice, the eliptical twice, and an aerobics class once. I plan on going to either the kick boxing or the dance class tonight. I love it!

More good news, my KATIE moved here. I am so excited. I met her, her dad and her roommate Kelly at Moe's last night. It was super great to see her. We did a little shopping at Walmart and then she meet all of our kitters. Only super fun to come with Kate living here.

So I met my new client Angel yesterday. I was there from 2:30-9:30. She is an interesting girl. Here Grandfather (who is her adoptive father) called me a miracle worker since she was in bed, showered, and her teeth were brushed by the time I left. Whatever, lol.

Ok I am being told it is time to go to Panera for lunch. Chow time!

First Blog
Hello everyone. I just found this site to create my first blog. I have been super busy this past month with work, school finishing and Animal People. Finally January has arrived, and a new semester is about to begin. I have taken on a second client to help bring in some more money so now I will be working 40 hours a week. I need to take one class in order to stay on my parent's health insurance. I first need to pay off a debt I have to the college in order to register for a class. I have I think a week or so to do it. It will hopefully get done or I will be in some major problems with mi madre.

Cory is not taking classes again this semester because we need him to work also. He is doing about 40 hours a week at Dominos while making $10 an hour. So we are doing well, finally. We need to just keep it up. We have two credit cards that need to be paid off, and we will hopefully have them done by the begining of march. Let's keep our fingers crossed on that one. Fianances aside, everything is wonderful. We have a beautiful apartment and our wonderfully little family with Moses, Maximus, Sadie, and Kiwi.

I will post again when I have some more stuff to talk about. My mom thinks that we are planning on getting married in May of 2007, which we are unless I can talk to them about us planning it for December of 2006. I have always wanted a winter wedding, but I do not want to wait another 7 months so if we have to have it in May then the show will go on. We are planning on a graden wedding at my parent's house with our color schemes being green and yellow.

Totally let me know if you have any ideas for our wedding.

Much Love.

Rap still wants me to move in with him, but I'm very sure it's not going to happen now that Anita and Micah have gone off. Before I even got to speak to them. Why does this always happen? Why do I feel like I have no home again. 

<i>Home is where the heart is..</i>

Maybe I'm heartless.  I need to head over the rainbow and go see the wizard, but I'm not allowed to talk to wizards right now and get their treats. No, I have to be a good kitty, so good that it hurts. Right?"

I love Nath alot. A whole lot. Everyone knows I'd do anything for him. (Jason more then the others.)

I think Anita might know now, which is a little scary for me because I really don't know what to say to Nath if he asks. I need to go see the rat king, I need tomake sure he's okay as well.

Then there is Lil, I should check on her too.

So much to do. How could I ever think that I could leave.

"event","Nath is safe. 

If&nbsp; that is what I can call it. I&nbsp; could tell by the mere smell of him what that bastard did to him. I could tell by the color of his skin. The way his body shock just a little. I couldn't get close to him. I couldn't even touch him. Why? Because I knew part of this was my fult. Even now I&nbsp; keep getting up to go see him and sitting back down. Because I know he will be upset with me. I also know he needs to see me. How many things have we been through, I never walked away before and I am not now. 

I just&nbsp; not sure when to go. I want to go crawl over him and place him in my arms and love him.&nbsp; Not that I ever stopped. I love the kitten more then anyone could understand. I never told him, because I know that it would change things. Change everything.&nbsp; I sat gaurd while they went out hunting. I stat with my back to the girl's door, because I didn't want them to have to see me break down. I did speak to the rat king however. I might end up having a job with him. That at least means I can start getting myself together. 

I've already tired, so many times. However this time has to be diffent. Maybe today I'll go see Nath, he's just in the other room. Why can't I do this? Why can't I stand up and walk to him. I never had this hard time before.&nbsp; 

Even after all that has happened between us and everything he's been through, the kitten still pure in my eyes. He's still a kid that I love and want to keep safe. Perhaps thats why I feel better standing out side the door and nearly hissing at anyone who steps close to the door.&nbsp; However when Jason came into the house with the baby, I was back down stairs watching Damian's coffin. 

Right now. I am going. I am going to cheek on my Kitten. I just hope I can be near him with out breaking down crying.&nbsp; God, Nath forgive me."

"event","Dear Micah,<br /><br />I couldn't say this to your face, maybe some part of me is still scared of being to weak for the pard. <br /><br />But I haven't told you. I haven't told you how good for the pard you have been. How good for all of us. Yes, I know it doesn't seem like it. I know that things have been so odd. I mean we all have our problems. You have some too I am sure. I know that you came from a pard that wasn't safe as well. Maybe that is why you take such good&nbsp; care of us.&nbsp; I wish I could go to you and tell you. It just sounds so stupid coming from me. Maybe if Anita told you what a good job you were doing. Then yeah it would sound right. But I am just your cat. Yes, your's. Yes your's and Anita. You proved that to me this morning when you spoke to me. <br /><br />I have felt that I've belong to Anita, hell, who doesn't know when they belong to Anita Blake?&nbsp; No, it wasn't your fult that I didn't feel like&nbsp; I belonged to you. It was my own doing. You see, this is the one that I've learned,&nbsp; others can put you down, can hurt you. Yet, they can't really cut you to the quick. You do that all yourself. Thats what I've been doing to myself. Cutting myself in half. Telling myself that I don't quiet belong here. Stupid, huh. <br /><br />This morning you made me feel like I belong, yes.. yes.. you've done it before but this time, this one little time I fully understood. You took me out of my beast form. It was.. gentle.&nbsp; I've never felt that before.&nbsp; ( I mean I've slipped back before..) Gabe would let me stay as long as I could in my form. No one knows this but I am&nbsp; mostly the reason why I have kitty eyes and fangs. It was just safer to stay in were form. However this morning I felt safer passing out to you in my human form then I have in a while. <br /><br />I lived on the streets for most of my life, so I learned that one has to be on their toes all the time. That they allow anyone to close. I relearned that with Gabe. I was fucking in love with him. Not the romance kind of way. It just that he was what I thought I wanted. He controled every thing about me. He hurt me. I was greatful. He loved on me. I was greatful. <br /><br />You aren't Gabe. I am greatful. <em><strong>Very Greatful. </strong></em><br /><br />I am not sure what I am trying to stay. Um, thank you?<br /><br />It doesn't seem like a enough. <br /><br />-Your cat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zane."

"event","<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I couldn't face my pard brother. Couldn't look into his eyes and tell him that I did not know where his twin was. I should of stood up and looked at him, should of took him into my arms and loved him.&nbsp; I know that I am falling a part. I know that I am breaking some how. But I can be stronger then his. The talk with Micah helped lots. Being something important to Damian helps as well. I've been trying to think of why I ended up like this. Why I am feeling like I have no path. I think it's because I knew what I needed to do with Gabe around. I was his toy. His cat. I didn't belong to myself.&nbsp; Now that I kinda of do? It scares the shit out of me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was green with want when Anita made Nath her's. But I told myself that he needed it more then anyone. That the kitten needed someone who would always be there for him. I couldn't be anymore? I had to work make enough money to buy a house.&nbsp; Right? Right? No, I had to be wild and free. I was no longer collared and contorted. <em>(I do miss the collar sometimes, I miss how tight it was, how I could almost couldn't breath.&nbsp; How can so many of my ""Happy"" memories have so much pain in them?) </em>Why am I confessing all of this to you? Maybe because I saw you and her together and I worried maybe that I was going to hurt you both. I love Cherry. I love you. I don't understand how I could love either of you differently. <br /><br />I know that she wont be able to handle it right now. I think she is close to being broken too. We'll close right Jason?&nbsp; I know we have fucked, we have laughed, we have made loved. We have done million and one things together. But how close have I let you be? Do I hold you away from me? I seem to do that to everyone. I seem to hold everyone at arms length.&nbsp; I don't want to do that any more. But I am scared of how close I can pull you with out hurting you.<br /><br />I know, I know you are going to tell me that I can't hurt you. That I can't hurt you with out you fighting back. Maybe thats why I love you Jason. You fight so strong. You also have Jean Claude, which means you aren't fully mine. Have you noticed? I always love people who can't be full mine. It was like that with Nath? Do you remember when I told you I was in love with him? How many years, months, weeks, days ago was that?&nbsp; Now with Cherry? Is it me always pushing her away or does she push me away? <br /><br />There is a list of things I should tell you. I should allow myself to say. I've been using again. I've been lieing to everyone saying I am fine. I know how very well to hide the drugs. To hide how sick they make me. I bought a party pack.&nbsp; I can't remember if I used it or not. God, I can't remember so much about last night. I can barely remember their faces Jase, I am losing it. I want to be whole again. <br /><br />Maybe that is why I want to belong to Damian. His little blood apple. Yeah, but I fucked up he can feed from me if I am using. Thats why I&nbsp; think I went to him. Because I am so good at doing things for other people. If I am his, I wont use because it will hurt him. I am not strong, am I Jase?&nbsp; You knew me when Gabe was still alive? Was I this bad? What happened to me? I remember being stronger. But I feel stronger in some ways now. <br /><br />I should tell you this, I love Anita. I love Micah. They are so perfect for the pard. They care of each of the cats, they protect them. Some how I am not numbering myself among the cats they keep safe. Maybe some part of me is still trying to be all dommy and kingly. But I can't be I think we've already proved that didn't we? God, this turned into a rant, this turned into something I didn't think it would. I am not even sure all that I've said. There must be a hole in my lip because everything is coming out. Everything is wanting out. <br /><br />I cut my hair because I felt the need for a change. The need to look a little 'normal'. I still however keep running my hand over my head, trying to run my fingers through my hair as I think. It doesn't work. I have no hair.&nbsp; I am going to call Doc Lil, I am going to tell her about the drugs. Maybe she can help me. I know it's easier for our kind to drop the shit. That it goes through our system faster. I just need the will power to make myself stop. <br /><br />Thanks Puppy, if you read this, and thank you for all of my secrets you have kept. Thank you for being there. And being one of my closest friends. <br /></p>

Carl nearly died tonight because of me. He nearly died because I&nbsp; had to ask for his help. I had to go to him. When will I ever learn? When ever I try to do something good it always seems to get so fucked up.&nbsp; I want to ingore this pain, I want to do something that I can in very big touble for. I visited nath for a while, I was there with him I felt safe. I felt safe with Micah, with Anita. But now I am sitting by myself in the dark&nbsp; with my lap top on my lap. The only light is from the screen. I could leave now and no one would know. Hell, I know places that are still open that would welcome back in their doors. 

I know people who would enjoy hurting me because I want them to.&nbsp; I am trying to fight the need, the desire to be hurt, the desire to froce my body to take in drugs that would only hurt me. But I can't. I am to weak.&nbsp; I am shaking and I know what will stop it. I just need to get up and out of here. I know I can leave the house with out anyone noticing. I know I can go hide myself in my pain. 

I know I should be scared of the killer, but some part of me wants him to find me. Wants him to tear me up. I am not just feeling this just for Carl, but for my mother and other people&nbsp; that I've wronged. I've seen so much fucking death, this one was the hardest one to face. For it was to close to home. In fact it was about four block s from the place that I used to call home. 

I think I will go. I think I'll go find some place where I can forget everything. I need to be numb. I need to be so high that I can't see. I need pain. There is only one place where I can get both. Narcissus in chains it is.."

But I know people, they aren't the fancy pancy people like who Anita knows. These are the people that are just there on the streets trying to make it day by day. I went over to the tatto shop frist. The old guy that runs it was a friend of my moms, a real hippy, also he has a slight touch thing going on. He can read idems. 

I blushed Jason's hair and took a bit. I know something magical is going on. I can <b>smell</b> it. When I walked into the shop I almost forgot how you could get high just by him breathing in you. The smell of weed was strong and almost burned my nose. He greeted me in his own little stoned way. I wonder sometimes if he ever cut his hair. Its not as long as kittens but long enough for me to do a double take. It's all white and wirey. 

It took some talking but he did a little reading on the hair. His hands looked so much older then what I remembered. He asked a few questions about what was going on, I never saw someone lose their high so fast in my life.  He took the hair and kinda went stiff. 

In the end of it he burned the hair and told me that who ever did what ever they did to Jason is someone he didn't want to mess with. But he confirmed that it was some nasty dark magicks. He told me to leave and not come back for a few days. 

I still see the look of fear that swims in his eyes. It was so scary looking him the normal laid easy going look gone from his face. The only time I ever saw that was when I saw him exiting my mom's house after she <stirke>died</strike> was killed. 

I am going to go back to see Jason tomorrow and talk to Jean Claude. Maybe I could tell what I know to Anita and she can tell her witch friend. It's not much, no, not much at all."

Why is she leaving? She's stressed? Couldn't we help? Couldn't we all go over there and lay down together? That always helps me. I never felt more afraid when I saw those words. Everytime she talks about it or does it I feel like I am going to be tore apart. I don't know why I am so fucking scared about it.

I think I am going to go over to the house and talk to her. Try to make her feel less stressed. I don't want her to leave. I know she's not the best at everything but she is Nimir-ra. Mother. 

After reading her journal I had to buy 	Marlboros, I only really smoke those when I am <i>stressed</i>. Because I am also worried about being left with Micah. I don't know where we stand. I want to be over him, I want to bring him to his knees because he hasn't done it to me. I just don't know where I am suppose to be.

I fucking hate how I can have something so nice as the girl I have but still want more. Maybe because I know we care for each other but we aren't in love. I try, I really do but I need something more. I've read Narcissus' post and I am getting jelous of Nath agian. Yes, I have become the scary green-eyed monster before because of him. 

I love the kitten. If you know him, you love him. Thats  just how it works. Yet, I watch him with Anita and Micah and I wish it was me. I am being stupid. I know Anita cares for us all and so does Micah. But I know Anita loves the kitten.

I don't want Narcissus. I had time with him before. It was enough. Honestily it was. He reminds me of my old Nimir-raj and part of me misses him. Thats the reason why I tend to stay away a little from Narcissus. I don't want to miss him. I shouldn't right? 

Gawh, I just need to keep up with everything. 

I wish I knew how to respond to Micah, I know he's diffent. He's very diffent, but I still have it in my mind that I am to kneel every once in a while.

But hearing Anita upset, Nath upset, and yes, Stephen upset worries me.  Hits me where it hurts, you know? This is family. This is people I would give my life for. 

Yes, Stephen you are on that list. How could I not feel the need to keep you safe when your brother and I are pard mates? I remember the frist time I saw you. Your eyes where the only thing I could see. They are so diffent from Greg's, I am not even sure what it was. I didn't even noticed you two were twins until I saw you both standing together. 

Yes, kiddies sometimes I am that slow. 

Anita the kitten loves you, if you left him he would die. You are so much to him. Sometimes when I watch you two I feel like a step-kid, I know you care for all of us. We are your leopards, Narcissus is right, it's like being a mother. Do you know how much we look up to you? Do you know how we listen to your every word. I know sometimes it doesn't seem like it. But none of us are truely used to a normal family. It's like we are all waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Nimir-Ra, our lives are your's to use. Can't you see that? Don't push the kitten away, don't hurt him please. He's been through so much.

"event","I remember before Anita came, before when I was  changed the feeling of the drugs rushing through my blood. I remember how heroin shoot into my arm would make my eyes go wide then close in the most dangerus of pleasures. I remember allow the most dangerus things happen to my body when I allowed the people I sold to have me. I was higher then hell. There was something about fucking a girl who was just as massed up as you, her eyes widen open her head tilted back. Your body trusting powerfully into her tighten openings. It was almost like dieing. 

The frist taste of 'E'roll back off your tongue, the feeling of pleasure as just the smallest touches from a stranger, from a john, from the wind. Oh, you never felt anything like standing in the wind while your body tries to contorl the sensations that burn over you like a wild fire. Sometimes it's so good your arms fling to your sides and it's like you are going to fly. Other times? It's so much you can bearily breath, all the air seems to be froced from your body. You gasp, you goan and you try to  blance yourself. 

But there is no blance. 

There is only in the need to take in as much air as you can gather. But it's never enough. Just like when you take one drug, one little pill, one little needle, it's never enough because you know you can have more. It just costs a little money, it just costs a little more life. And in the throws of it all you would give it. 

Here what I am wondering. Is Asher's bite like this? Is it a drug? Once you had it do you need to have it agian? Do you need to bear your neck so that he can give you in a prick <i>(most likely a large one from what I hear.)</i> so that he can give you the drug agian. You only have to give a little blood, a little life. 

I remember what it felt like in the wind. Good and bad. I remember what it was like to have Gabriel  yink me free, give me my beast and ground me. Maybe, if Asher would let me. Because his words moved me <i>( upwards if anything)</i>to want to bear my neck, to offer myself up for a diffent kind of drug. To get to know the man behind the pained blue eyes and mornful words.

But it doesn't mean Narcissus should of let him have Nath. No! I for one I am greatful to Narcissus for not allow the kitten out of sight. 

Because it showed me that he wouldn't turn me over to someone if I was pasted out. How did the Oba know rather or not it was safe for Richard to have him? I mean Anita and him offen do fight. What if they had a large fight? I heard Jason was there,I trust Jason but he is still a wolf. I do want to ask Nath why he was there with out someone. That worries me a little.

My boss is normally a cool dude <i>(Dude? Fuck, I've been sending way to much time with Adonis. But damn he's one sexy bitch.)</i> but tonight he had a bug up his butt. The other tender just got fired so now we need to find another person to work days. Because I diffently do not want to deal with the Devil!Boss. Nope, not at all. 

So this journal thing aren't that bad after all? I guess I can really get into it. Through I am not sure I like posting it all for the world to see. How would they know it was me really? There has to be other Zane's right? But I wonder how many are weres? Oh, come on stand up and rise your hands? None? Well, damn. 

I started smoking agian, tired to stop. But what's the point really? I don't do it around other people so it's just my lungs that are getting smoked filled. It's kind of hard to stop when everyone at work is smoking, the smell really gets to me. And if I am smoking cigs I am not doing anything else. 

I can still remember my frist time, smoking that is, I was 12 right after my mother's death. She was a smoker too you see. No, she didn't die from lung sickness, she just well died. <i>(I don't wanna talk about it. Not yet.)</i> I did it the frist time so that I could smell something like  my mother. Well, I just kept doing it so well now I guess I can't stop. Maybe because it's the last thing I have of dear old mom. Who really knows?

Alright, alright, I don't want to get to fucking whiney. I am going to sign off and go head out to party. I need a good drink. You would think working with the stuff all day/night I wouldn't want it, but I do have a weakness for the wiskey! 

Later Kiddies,

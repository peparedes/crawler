"event","Well, the 2002 Bay Area Theatre Critics Award nominations are in. I didn't get any, but then again... I don't think I was even IN anything that would have been eligable (:oP) Maybe I'll get one next year for Best 12 Foot Dragon. (Oh, the Double Entendre of it all)

Anyhoo, very glad to see some of the nominations that DID make it. Amongst them, Berkeley Rep's brilliant <i>Homebody/Kabul</i> for Best Production (though their Cloud 9 <i>should</i> have gotten a nod) and in the same category SJ Rep's <i>The Mandrake Root.</i>  That one is odd, because it's from the season that I heartily sold, and I remember particularly selling <i>that</i> show. I may not have had anything to do with what was <i>on</i> stage, but I sure did get a whole lot of butts in the seats to <i>see </i> that show.

Thakfully, Michelle Morain (said Homebody of said Kushner play) has been nominated for her tour de force performance, and if she doesn't get it, I'll curse the houses of all involved!

In the Musical department, both of our shows from last year (<i>She Loves Me</i> and <i>On The Town</i>) have been nominated for Best Production, along with TheatreWorks' <i>Ragtime</i> (damn, I wish I would have seen that show.)  Twill probably go to the latter, but I would love to see <i>She Loves Me</i> walk away with it. It was just so incredibly charming, and well done all around. Classic musical theatre at its best. Our own Jay Manley is up for 2 Best Director awards, my beloved Janis is up for Best Costume Design, and Joe Ragey for 2 Best Set Design awards (damn, that man can design.) 

And a special yay to Keite Davis for her Best Actress nom!

Congrats to all my folk who got a nomination, who knows, maybe next year I'll be in their number. ;o)"

"event","So, we're seeing <i>Suddenly Last Summer</i> this Sunday. I'm unfamiliar with the show, but the synopsis sounds quite intriguing, and almost everything I have seen at Berkeley Rep has been incredibly amazing. That which has NOT been, has still been DAMN GOOD, and that which HAS been has made my list of top things I've ever seen. 

So, this leads me to thinking. Sometime back, I wrote a lengthy post about the greatest single performances I've seen in my time, but I have yet to describe the CRAP I have been witness to! (a post about the greatest <i>productions</i> I have seen will have to wait)

Alas, when you see a great deal of theatre, you're bound to see some dreadful shows every now and then. It makes you appreciate the good theatre that much more. Now, I have decided to be most kind and leave anything done by children/teenagers OFF this list, as they can't be held to the same standards as professionals. (Jeckyl & Hyde and Oklahoma sigh a breath of relief as they shan't recieve a beating today)

Where to begin? Let's start at the college level (ha, thought I was THAT nice- I'm not) Hmm, politcal reasons keep me from <i>naming</i> what I consider the worst college production I have ever seen, but let's just say it was a Shakespeare, and if asked by the director what I thought, all I could think to say would be ""I don't knooooooooow"" or ""Oh, I want to KICK you!""

;o)

Then there was Oxford University's production of <b>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.</b> Yes, that's right. I am placing what I consider to be the greatest piece of theatre ever written on my list of worse things seen. This is a case where the material is not at all to blame, but the production itself had absolutely nothing going for it. The following grievances can be listed:

1) Mrs.Lovett was <i>literally</i> the ONLY singer in the cast- the only singer in a show with some VERY difficult music. So what do they do with their only talented singer? They put a choker on her! THEN they put her microphone IN the choker! The microphone hisses and buzzes with every breath she takes. 

2) They cast the Cat in The Hat as the Beadle. WHERE was Heather when you needed her?

3) Anthony had Keanureevitisis

There was SO much more wrong with this production, but eh... Tim and I enjoyed a nice train trip to Oxford (catching the VERY last train back home before all trains to London became suddenly flooded out of the city) but it was the first time I had ever seen my favorite show live. Thank God I got to see the George Hearn concert in SF only months later (to make it up, Tim was once again my companion)

Ok, on to professional shows! Time for the dirt!

AGH! Again, political reasons keep me from listing pretty much ANYTHING seen at a certain Bay Area company. Let's just say that if this company was suddenly gone, Sarah Wood might sing of how she missed it.... and a warning to all, if you think you want to see a show there- DON'T.

Madame Melville- Vaudeville Theatre, London. Ok, so this thing starred Macauley Culkin. Yeah... THAT Macauley Culkin. In that small theatre, I could have spit on him. I probably should have, then perhaps he would show <i>some</i> emotion. 

Much Ado About Nothing- Shady Shakespeare Company.... UGH.... I was DRAGGED to this, because people I know were in it (and people I don't even LI-) anyway.... the only good thing to say was that this was in a forest, and there were some very cool animals making noises all around us. It was also fun because at intermission, ""California Dreamin"" (the song that has always meant more to me than any other) began to play, and I merely commented to the several ladies I was with ""Ah, my song."" The busty gal in front of us turned about and said ""Oh, no! This is MY song!"" Without skipping a beat, the four girls I was with SCREAMED ""IT'S <b>HIS</b> SONG!!"" 

The busty gal said no more.

And now for the Crappiest Things I've Seen Awards-

<b>Worst Cast of Professional Production-</b> Chicago, London Cast- Fall 2000.

UGH... This was my introduction to this show, and I was bitter against it for a long time after. This HAD to be the worst cast EVER. Sacha Distel (who <i>apparently</i> was some singer of note in 1960's France) was a lifeless, heavily accented Billy Flynn who couldn't sing a note.  In fact, none of the leads could speak English!! They all had the weirdest accents possible! At the time, the print ads all over London were using very provactive shots of some of the ensemble members. The male used was a feller named Dan Rymer. We sat up in ""The Gods"" and I shelled out 40p to get those li'l plastic opera glasses, and just watched Mr.Rymer the whole evening. Nuff said.

<b>Most Embarassing Piece of Crap</b>- KEPT, TheatreWorks. April 2002.

Oy vey. This was just BAAAAAAAD. I call it most embarassing, because I felt SO bad for those involved in its creation. At the time, you'd read hopeful reports from Bill Russel's partner, and it all seemed SO exciting. Then, you SAW the show and felt so sad because it was NEVER near as good as they thought it was. The poor guy called the score ""Amazing.""

I'm sorry, but even if you LIKED the show... ANYONE who would label it or its score ""Amazing"" needs to be taken out back and shot for their own good,

<b>Worst Professional Show I Have Ever Seen</b>- Romeo & Juliet, The Royal National Theatre, London, September 2000.

This I shall label the worst because it was put on by such a prestigious company. Never have I seen such atrocious work from such top-notch creators. Trevor Nunn, renowned directo and the NT's Artistic Director, stepped it to try and save it, and instead was blamed for making it even worse. It was trounced by every critic around, and was a great source of embarassment for both the company, and Nunn. Ugh.

Eh, now I'm tired. If you got bored reading this, eh... too bad. If you didn't get bored, I love you! If you think I'm just a cold-hearted theatre-goer who enjoys ripping bad things to shreds- I AM. >:o)"

Ok, that's kinda cute whatever... she brought the food, and asked if we could pass her the ketchup. We did, and she proceeded to pour it out onto the little cardboard plates. Ok.... cute, but I was honestly expecting her to ask me to pass her the burgers so she could proceed to eat it FOR us.

Now, I have had MAAAANY Johnny Rocket's experiences in my life, and this policy has never been made apparent to me, so maybe she was just wacky.

Oh, madness, madness... and in a world gone mad... we all know what we do and what we certainly DON'T need. We especially are keenly aware of that which is, with little doubt, the very LAST thing we need in this topsy-turvy world where insanity is now seemingly the call of the day.

<i>The Gryphon gave the Pegasus a looking over...</i>

The entire venture, yes the ENTIRE venture was made to sit on the strength of a DAISY... that's right, a daisy!! It was soon learned that Daisies, are <i>not</i> nature's adhesive, nor can they be counted upon to do the job requested of them. In fact, they are miserable failures that really only ever cause discontention and pain. Victorian girls are made to spend several wasted minutes contemplating the virtue of structuring these items into elaborate chains. Chains that no doubt will have no strength in them, and will NOT be conducive to aiding the flying endeavors of the world. 

Daisies can also be blamed for their distasteful practice of leading many of this world's young and amorous dreamers to the painful querie of whether they are loved or loved not. Whilst many times the desired result is indeed achieved (and oft through methods that must be brought into suspicion) there are too many broken hearts left in the wake of a daisy's cruel verdict that indeed proves, they love you not. Thankfully, no daisies were fiendish enough to provide this outcome at the time in question, but one just knows there were many who would have eagerly done so. Such is their nature. They are indeed villains on high.

<i>And He liked what he saw</i>

As should have been expected, Plastics Made it Possible. False heart valves, bubble wrap, zip ties, and tupper ware. We should have known that this would be the reliable source. Daisies! What foolish ideals we had at that young stage of the adventure. Yes, dear friends... Plastic. Oh, how glorious it was, that initial take off. Soaring, soaring high. Yes, Virginia, they DO have kites in Indonesia. Intimidating, beautiful, frightening, gorgeous and terrible all at once. Scoffs all around to those with their muticolored sperm! Charles never did equal the majesty of that inaugural ascension, but he made several noble efforts, and the memory of the majesty was enough to keep the joy afloat. 

<i>The Gryphon decided he would chat the Pegasus up</i>

What ARE the odds of it being sold that very day? Madness, madness, madness. Notions of getting something cute were not realised. Oh well, what cute needs could ever surpass that which <i>is</i> had, and appreciated above all.

<i>And he did</i>

 You learn, you grow, you fall even deeper, and you just thank whomever needs the thanking for this Glorious gift.

Hmmm... Tis a real shame that John Cullum probably has a snowball's chance of getting cast. The man is one of the greatest actors in Broadway history, and his performance of Cladwell is spot on. Alas, his most bankable screen role is that of Dr.Greene's father on ""ER.""

Now, popular as that show is, that role really doesn't guarantee box office success. For instance, Bebe Neuwirth is known to millions of television viewers as Lilith from Cheers and Frasier, yet nobody beat down her door to cast her in Chicago. 

Oh well... I personally can see Al Pacino doing quite well in John's role for the film, and since Cladwell's songs are pretty simple (a GREAT waste of Cullum's incredible voice) it makes for several casting options. Eh, I still see Pacino doing it."

"event","Well, tonight ended one of my guiltiest of pleasures of the last several years, the gritty HBO series- <i>Oz.</i> I don't know why I thought the show was on for 8 years. Seems it was on only for 6. Oh well. 

I remember that when it premiered (six years ago) I used to watch it in secret, not because of the extreme violence, rape, or foul language that frequented the series, but mostly the highly gratuitous full male nudity, and homosexual storylines. (I was, after all, a highly closeted 16 year old at the time)  It was then the guiltiest of guilty pleasures, the secret pleasure. 

Eventually, I came out, and so my <i>Oz</i> viewing was public knowledge. Now, I will never claim that it was the greatest show on television, when it all boils down to it, it was a soap opera like any other. At its very best, <i>Oz</i> was a highly compelling drama- at its worst, it was downright ludicrous (the aging drug, anyone?) 

And now, I shall get all fanboy on everybody, and give my thoughts on the final episode.. this is official warning (though I don't think anyone who reads my journal watches the show) this post shall now contain MAJOR SPOILERS CONCERNING THE FINAL EPISODE EVER OF OZ!!

Y'all got that? Good.

SOO.. where does one begin? I think the writers did a commendable job of really <i>using</i> the 100 minutes, and efficiently bringing all the major storylines to an acceptable conclusion. (mostly) I still wonder, however, why- in a show that has never been exclusive in which major players they kill off- why, NOBODY could find a way to kill either Betty Buckley's or Patti LuPone's characters. Hmph. I mean, at LEAST LuPone (though Buckley still owes the world for her horrid rendition of 'Meadowlark') 

A little too much time was spent with EVERY damn character though. Did anyone need to know what happened to the CO with the sliced tendon? I sure as hell didn't need to see LuPone reading Tom Sawyer to some guy whilst he sits, completely nude in a resraint chair (wierdos.) It was nice that Ribadow and Busmalis got some air-time, and survived (bless them) and YUCK to the hideous, slutty CO woman getting preggers. Serves ya right, ya hussy!

I was livid when I thought they were going to kill off Father Mukada!! (tangent time) I remember all those years ago, feeling EXTRA guilty when I thought that the actor who plays him, B.D. Wong, was OH SO HOT. Guilty, because he only ever appeared in his priest outfit, and that just felt...icky. Oh well, he was still hot. 

Sadness abounding at the final fate of Miguel Alvarez, who (played by Kirk Acevedo) was my MAJOR Oz crush for the first few years. Poor guy, after all that, he ends up with no hope of parole, back on drugs, and the bitch of the slimy club-owner guy with the evil eye. Sigh.

Betty Buckley is insane!! They could have had Seamus shank her! Her little pre-Macbeth speech was annoying. Hmph.

Who could help but be touched when they finally executed Cyril O'Reilly?? There were just some characters you thought they would never touch... but hell, when they killed Hill, Said, and the Warden all in the last year, you knew they stopped playing that game. 

At long last- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BEECHER-SCHILLINGER-KELLER TO A GREAT END!!!!

This is what <i>needed</i> to happen. We began the series following Tobias Beecher, and we needed to end it with him. The final facedown with Vern Schillinger (who has to be one of the greatest villains in television history. Why <a href=""http:/us.imdb.com/Name?Simmons,%20J.K."">J.K. Simmons</a> has never won an Emmy for his portrayal is beyond me.) was appropriately theatrical. We've all waited for Schillinger to die for all these years, and it was a great thing to see it happen. Bah-hah! Then to have Keller meet his fate, and the look of agony in Beecher's eyes- ahhh, now that's some good tragic love-tales, I tells ya!

The final moments were a bit odd, but it wrapped up nicely, I suppose.  So long, Oswald, so long Em City, so long all you craaaazy characters.

The fact that when my parents were gone, that meant that I had the house ALL to myself (except when Mario, Katie, and the kids would pop by. Ugh) 

Siiiiiigh...

Alas, I understand WHY they're moving back. They want to save up to buy a house, but COME ON... You guys are 24! Married! With TWO kids!! Stop living at home!!! 

Also, my parents decided that there needs be a ""talk"" in which Mario and Katie are told that things have changed in their absence, and that particularly, they better not object to Reynaldi staying over. Which, they DON'T object to, but the folks just want to lay down the law. I guess that's nice. 

Sigh... the peace, the quiet... 

However, in his usual fashion, at the VERY moment I found this out, Reynaldi sent me a very simple email saying ""I love you."" Even when he doesn't know I need cheering up, he manages to make me smile. I love you too, sweetie. 

Also, in a most happy piece of news, the very LAST book on my life-long list of wanted Jim Henson related books is FINALLY being reprinted. 

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0810945797/qid=1045710934/sr=8-7/ref=sr_8_7/104-2857383-2002304?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"">The World of The Dark Crystal</a> The cheapest I have ever seen this book go for is about $400. I have OFTEN seen it well into the thousands. Now, I can get an all new copy (with tons of new collector's edition material) for only $21.00 on Amazon. Sounds a good deal to me.

Sigh.... well, I guess bitterness is subsiding into acceptance... whatever. Bring it on, bring it on. Just more incentive for me to move out. :oP

"event","I haven't been since April of 2001, and I'm itchin' to go back. However, there is new reason to want to go. Denny Doherty is bringing his show (formerly titled <i>Dream a Little Dream</i>) there in April. For those who don't know, Denny Doherty was one fourth of my favorite group of all eternity- The Mamas and The Papas.

Specifically, Denny was the lead male vocal, so when you hear songs like ""California Dreamin"" and ""Monday, Monday"" that's Denny with what was once described as ""The greatest tenor voice in pop history"" that ""ages like a fine cognac.""

Now, I have the CD recording of <i>Dream a Little Dream</i> from when it first premiered in Doherty's native Canada. The recording surely could be more complete (I wish much more of his dialogue was included) but it is a really touching account of what went on with the group. Particulary, at the end when he starts in on Cass Elliot's signature song (Dream A Little Dream of Me) and he gets very audibly choked up and teary as he says ""Cass, all I know is- you're gone... and I miss you.""  it's enough to make anyone get a lump in the throat.

Now, his voice surely has aged...and that's reasonable seeing as he is now 61 years old, but his voice is still lovely and has gained nice character. 

So, yeah... I want to go to New York.

In other news, I am definitely going to put myself forward to continue leading the Brown Bag Theatre next quarter. I have to. I made a commitment to see this out for a full year, and my word and the notion of commitment means everything to me. Aside from that, the ideas floating around for next quarter are very exciting to me, and involve things I have ALWAYS wanted to do with the program, but until now were not deemed logical.

Top on the list, the proposed 2 hour EVENING ""Best of"" show. This would give a rare opportunity to revisit past work. Normally, I don't like to do that, but some of these pieces would be very exciting for me to go back to. Particulary, I would love to do ""Love"" once more, and reprise my acclaimed role as the Devil. I would REALLY like to do ""Black Magyck Women"" with an entirely different cast. Now, I loved the ladies who did it before, they made it shine, but I think this year's group has SOO much potential for some fun casting choices. 

Already I could envision the following cast:

Loretta: Brooke (who would just be perfect for it)

Mags: Irish Jennifer (that is BEYOND perfect casting)

Hester: Heather (who is so much more the type I originally envisioned in the role) 

I could even design an all new Howard puppet! Oh! The possibilities! The madness! The INSANITY!!!

AND I COULD DO ""VOODOO QUEEN!""

MWA-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!""

Above all, this COULD be a chance for people to see me perform as those are going to be rarer the rest of the school year. 

A general note to all those who keep asking.

I will be performing in an evening of improv comedy sometime in late March. The actual date has not been determined, but it will very likely be the last week of March, as that is when we have finals. Admission will be free, and is open to all. I will alert people of the actual date when I have it. 

You can see my directing work in early April in our evening of One Act plays, <i>The Seven Deadly Sins.</i> I am directing the final play of the evening, entitled <i>Cement Hands.</i> It's a terrific play with a wicked sense of humor, and stars a stellar cast including Ms. Brooke Milos, and Ms. Heather Orth-Tribuzi. The Foothill Box Office can be reached at (650) 949-7360 for tickets, info, etc. 

The best of Brown Bag show (if it happens) will likely be in June sometime, and will be an evening event, and also likely free. I would say it's safe to say that I would be acting/directing in that show. 

Now THIS is soooo not settled yet, but there is also a possibilty that we may be doing a reading of my new play sometime before the year is out. More on that as it develops. If so, it would very likely be a one-night only kind of thing, and of course, free. 

So, that's the upcoming calendar of Jaime's Works. 

Damn, this post is long. I'm outta here!!!!

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS!!!!

"event","He opened his eyes slowly, and turned his head to see the face of the clock. Though it lie less than two feet away, he still had to squint so that his fractured eyes might make sense of the blurred splashes of red.

It was sometime after 9 am, that was all he could discern. He looked over to the arm and hand that held him tight, and he smiled. He thought to himself that there could be no other way to start a day that would rival this. To awaken in the arms of the person you love more than anything, and to be able to just lie there with him and look into his beautiful eyes and not have to say a word. To just be there with him. His thoughts began to drift yet again to the same notion they often did these days; about how more than anything he wished that every day could begin like this, and that every night could be spent in the arms of his love. 

Someday, he thought, and the thought made him smile again. For now, he would have to eventually fight the overwhelming urge to remain in the bed and trudge on out into the world. After all, the blonde girl would be expecting him to arrive sometime after noon, so they could go up into The City to see <i>American Buffalo</i> at A.C.T. That thought also pleased him, and he looked forward to the inevitable fun to be had during the drive up. He intended to introduce her to <i>On The Twentieth Century,</i> with its mix of operetta, jazz, and brilliantly witty lyrics and performances.

As he lay there, and the minutes continued to pass devoid of any leaving of the bed on either of their parts, he started to crave a McDonald's breakfast bagel. This made him chuckle to himself, and he thought ""Does anybody actually do that? Crave a McDonald's breakfast bagel?"" He thought it particularly amusing given that the two of them shared a love for the finer things in life, and that certainly extended to their dining habits. Yet, one couldn't argue with the sheer power that is the Steak, Egg and Cheese Bagel. It called to him, it's fiendish wiles knew exactly how to manipulate his thoughts, and he suggested a trip to Le Mac was quite in order. Fortunately, his love agreed, and it was another reason to smile, that they could often be thinking the same thing and not have to get into large debates over what the best course of action would be.

After all ablutions were well seen to, the journey began and they arrived with only minutes to spare before the lunch menu would be on offer. However, not even the joys of bageldom would prepare him for what was to come. 

As they sat there, reminiscing about fast food items of days long gone by, the Blonde girl called him.  Immediately, his mood sank, and he prepared himself for the excuses that were sure to come. She never called ANYONE. EVER. She would obviously be saying only one thing...

""Well, I have good news, and I have bad news.""

Did she really hope to win him over with that tired line? There wouldn't be good news! They both knew that. He began to anticipate what the reason would be this time, and wondered if he should already be at the point when he should <i>expect</i> this to happen? He didn't want to be at that point. He wanted so very much to retain an glimmer of faith in her. 

She explained away about why she wouldn't be going, and all he could think was that it was her own damn fault and that above all, he certainly didn't want to go now. He had no desire to drive all the way up there to sit next to Sharon Mahoney of all people. 

He looked across the table to his love, who of course had known the ways of the Blonde long before he ever did and recieved a sympathetic smile. He hung up, and tried to think what he would do with himself for the rest of the day. If anything, he would get to spend at least another hour or so with his love now, and that was a reason to be grateful. 

When he finally had to depart from his love, he decided to stop in on some malls, and various shops. A hankering for DVDs was strong, yet seemingly not strong enough, as none made their way from shop to home. As he drove about, he saw two seperate cars in two seperate areas with Georgia license plates. TWO Georgian cars in San Mateo, California? It was too bizarre to contemplate, and he took it as a hint that he should probably be listening to <i>Parade.</i> As luck would have it, the CD just happened to be in his small case along with his cavalcade of The Mamas and The Papas. He thought it odd for a second that it should be there exactly when he wanted to listen to it, but then decided that it mattered not if it was odd. It was there. 

His travels took him to Target, a locale where he had no real reason at ALL to be headed to. Entering, and browsing about he decided that Target is an entirely boring place to be if you have no reason to be there, and you are alone. A sudden need for the wicked satisfaction that can only be called Frappucino, coupled with an urge to see his Love for even just a minute more took him to Starbucks, where he recieved a ""wink, wink-nudge, nudge"" discount from the manager and a smile from the Love. Walking back to his car, he came to yet another of the profound epiphanies that were becoming the call of the day. He decided that he'd like to come into some kind of insane power, if only to tell the world- to tell all that would listen- that if possible, everyone on earth should get their boyfriend to start working at Starbucks, because then they too would enjoy the ecstasy of a well made Frappucino. Hell, perhaps he was idolizing it all just a <i>bit,</i> but the fact of the matter was that it was damned good. People shouldn't be deprived of this, he thought, but then maybe it was <i>just</i> the boyfriends who could benefit. Oh well... he figured people would catch on eventually.

As he travelled on, the desire for DVDs not quite shaken, the <i>Parade</i> fest continued. He began to wonder what ever happened to those people who claimed Brooke Sunny Moriber was the second coming of Jesus Christ? Because, of course, that all panned out.... he thought to himself that five to one, she was probably now slopping slaw on poorly washed plates in some dive in Hoboken or maybe Iowa. Who knew? He took some twisted satisfaction at the thought of many queens and bitches sourly saying ""Well, I THOUGHT she'd be big"" She WAS big, kiddos, it was the offers that got small.

He kept noticing that the CD was making an odd clicky noise, and that it even seemed to be skipping a bit... skipping? Skipping, in his father's luxury Sedan with it's lovely sound system. No CD of his <i>ever</i> skipped. Upon removal and inspection, the surface of the CD was in dreadful condition. A grin began to spread on his face, and he thought about how odd it was that the CD was even IN that case. It was his Love's copy. Only that lad could be owner to such a poorly cared for CD. That made him chuckle, and he thought how pristine he was about his own collection, and how it was a charming difference between them. He also marvelled at the fact that it had not yet been noted as missing by the Love. He would have to be sure to return it soon enough.

He finally decided it was time to go home, and he trudged on. Upon entering the house, he saw that there was an absolute glut of dishes to be dealt with. How on Earth was THAT possible? He never could seem to master the art of cooking for only two people <i>without</i> using every dish and piece of cookware in known creation. He decided to deal with the glut later. The cold silence of the house reminded him that he would be completely alone tonight, and that was a bit depressing. Once more his thoughts drifted into that euphoric idea that he might spend each night in the arms of his Love, and wake up each morning to sight of those beautiful eyes.

Someday, he thought, and the thought made him smile."

"event","I'm sure I could have come up with a more eloquent subject line... but right now, that's all I can really feel... allow me to explain.

This story begins almost three years ago now. It was Spring break, 2000. Late March. I was still 18 years old at the time, and been through my first two quarters of college. In fitting in with a standard cliche, that was the age and time I finally decided it was time to ""come out."" I started by telling only a very few friends, who I swore to secrecy, but there was still a great surge of the pent up emotion just TRYING to burst out of me. 

One night, during my break, I suddenly grabbed a notebook, and I began to write. I wrote and wrote the entire night, and soon it was past 2 am, but I didn't care, I just kept writing. 

The result was a 20-minute, one act play. In it, I got out all of those emotions through a character that was most obviously me. By night's end, I was in such an odd place. I had just let seven years of repressed feelings out, and I didn't know what to do next. As Spring Quarter began, I enrolled in the tiny Actor's Ensemble class at De Anza. It was my first time meeting evil Hester, and she mentioned that the class often showcased student work if it was there to be performed. I mentioned to her that I had just written the play, and she immediately scheduled a staged reading.

Now, the Actor's Ensemble performed in a converted classroom that only sat 30 audience members. For my play, I went out and I hussled my butt off to get people in seats. I went and spoke to the LGBA, and such. 

In rehearsal for the reading, I kissed a guy for the first time in my life. It was Z, who would play my boyfriend in the performance. 

It was the fact that it was actually going to be read that finally prompted me to come out to my parents. Something I was able to write about before I ever actually did it in real life. 

In April, the play was read (with such a terrible working title I won't even mention it) to a standing room only crowd of over SIXTY PEOPLE. (Remember, we only sat 30) People were literally out the door.  The results were amazing, and the crowd was in tears come the end. To this day, I will still meet people who tell me they were in that audience of only just over 60 and that my play moved them to tears. That is a feeling I cannot describe. 

The results were so good that we were asked to perform it again at De Anza's Gay Pride festival that year, which we did with a slightly different cast to an even bigger crowd and equal success.

It was then I really read that script, thought it served its purpose, but was crap that needed to be improved. I then trekked off to London, where I mapped out ideas for a full length version of the play. 

In early 2001, I began to write the new version (now called <i>What About Anna?</i>) and I have been chipping away at it ever since.

Tonight, I finished it.

Now, when I say I finished it, I mean I finshed the first DRAFT. But, NOW, now it's at a point where I can have some people read it and give their opinions. Hell, I'll be the first to admit I think it's flawed. One character in particular seems to sink eveyr time she steps on stage. But, now I can see what needs to be done with it. Janis wants to put together a staged reading of it. Last year, Jay Manley called excerpts of it ""Beautifully written"" and said that he would also love to see a finished draft. 

This feeling... is so incredible... this has been almost THREE YEARS in the making.... I can now DO SOMETHING WITH IT!!!! I've always wished it was a musical, but alas I have neither musical nor lyrical talent. That's where I need a collaborator. 

If anything, I need to iron out these flaws, because I think I have a sweet romance on my hands in this play. I know, nobody EVER expected me to write a sweet romance. I'm known for wickedly dark comedy, or fantastical tales of a mythic nature. Who knew that I could just get down and real? 

The first time I finsihed this play in 2000, it was past 2 am... and now it's ... what do you know? Hehe

There are so many people whose love has gone into this piece of work, though they may not know it. I thank them all for their unending support. 

For the child  that was, and will always be, somewhere.

For the boy that was dormant for so long, and who gave up so much.

For the man that is, and will be. 

Most of all, for He who has my heart and soul. I love you, sweetie. 

Good night, folks."

So yeaaaaah... I was going to post last night, but then I thought ""Nah, that whole LJ""

Ya know?

But oh well, guess we're all breaking that form today.

My brain is STILL miffed with me. But then my heart tells my brain to lighten up, that it was for them, and I would do anything for them. But STILLLLLLLLLL..... I have tried so very hard to escape that world, and have SUCCEEDED, why would I want to go back? A world full of undeserved egos,  friends whose only commonality is the fact that they go to same school and will never actually speak to each other again in the real world, CHILDREN... above all...CHILDREN.

I haaaaaaaaaaaate teenagers. I hated them when I WAS a teenager. :oP

As for the show itself.... eh.... nothing that I didn't expect. I just get a sick and twisted smile on my face when I think of these kids going out into the real world...

SMHS Kid: Hehehehe.... where's my mic... hehehehe?

Real World: Oh, we don't use them here, you have to project.

SMHS Kid: Hehhehehe... pro what? Hehehehe... where's my mic?

>;o)

Ok, so now that I've ranted about how much I hate teenagers, I think there are times I try too hard to repress all that. The post-pie session at the park was beyond glorious. I let all inhibitions go, whilst trying to sing ""Words, words, words"" whilst going crazy on the good swing. Those other two swings were NOT my friends. The one on the end that Heather started out on was the BEEEEEEEST!

I should resolve to allow myself zany kid-like times more often. Yes, I enjoy adulthood, and I deplore teens, but that doesn't mean I should always be a stoic grump. 

So, it seems Mr.Bob did die. Poor ol' guy. The neighborhood has lost a spot of color. Ye shall be missed, Mr.Bob.

Twould also seem that Stephen Sondheim's Jaguar is up for sale on eBay. He's selling it for charity. The user name is sondheimjag and they have 4 feeback comments. Now, I assume the username has been changed just for this auction, because how many jags would Sondheim be selling in the past? Hmmmm

Ah, but this user was a BUYER.. it seems...and they bought a classic book of anagrams. Hmm, Sondheimites all know his love of anagrams... that's kind of zany if it's actually HIM. Sondheim on eBay. What will they think of next?

So, overall, last night's park escapades were WELL WORTH the woe of sitting through the nonsense that preceeded it. I do however look forward to Janis' show tomorrow with GREAT furvor, hoping that it will counter my current inbalance of a theatrical viewing nature."

"event","I was just settling in, when I was woken by the sounds of a VERY large truck in my neighborhood. At midnight?!! I rushed over to our front windows to see a fire truck at the house across the street. Then an ambulance zoomed up, sirens a-blarin.

The house belongs to my neighbor, Bob. An elderly man who has lived in this neighborhood probably longer than anyone else. He was here long before my parents moved in, some 26 years ago. Recently, his son (who is probably arbout 50) moved in with him.

I saw the son come rushing out of the house, and the paramedics rushed in with a stretcher. Several minutes later, they came back out with presumably Bob on the stretcher, then they zoomed away. 

Wow...

I remember as a child, we would always wave to Bob across the street and shout ""HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY MISSSSSSSSTER BOOOOOOOOOOB!"" just like Dennis the Menace. That's what we always called him, Mr.Bob. He was always such an odd character. VERY GRUMPY... and looked just like Santa Claus. Fat, bald, and long white beard. 

I've been inside his house only once, and was amazed to find it full of beautifully ornate cuckoo clocks of all kinds. It was EXACTLY like Gepetto's house. MANY years back, Bob even asked my Grandmother out on a few dates. It didn't work out, apparently he told her that we (the kids) were too loud, and she didn't like that.

Mr.Bob has always been such a character... chasing potential burglars away with chains, and cursing every neighbor under the sun... although, he's always seemed to like MY family. He often would come by with bags of homegrown ""Tamaters"" as he called them.

I hope you're ok, Mr.Bob. You always were an interesting neighbor."

"event","So...

The Conservatory has a good number of very odd little quirks, we all know this. We're an odd bunch of people, that makes sense. We're actors, after all. The most disturbing such quirk is the dreaded TOM GOUGH DREAM.

Now, not just any dream mind you, the TOM GOUGH <b>SEXUAL</b> DREAM!! Yes, in the most tragic of ways, several Conservatory members over the years have had many sexual dreams involving our own Tom Gough. I've had to hear about far too many of them in great detail, and would like for this trend to stop. There is even, disturbingly, a whole sect of people who actually find Tom highly attractive, and thus welcome such mind trips...

It would seem that my particular class has altered the trend a bit to remove the sexuality of these dreams, but several members have had ones in which Tom severely reprimands them or otherwise chastises them.

Last night, down in the cafeteria, we all got on the subject of the TOM GOUGH DREAM. I loudly boasted that I had never once had any sort of Tom dream, sexual or otherwise.

...

So...

Last night, I'm dreaming that I'm in some slummy Brooklynesque neighborhood, and there's this Safeway on the bottom of all these low-income apartment buildings. Well, I go inside, and there is a very pregnant Laleh shopping with someone. She's demanding that they pick out these pre-packaged Salads. (What's with me and dreaming about pre-packaged foods?)  She's shouting ""Get that one! It's a feast, I tells ya! A Feast!""

Well...who should be her shopping partner, but TOM GOUGH. NOOOOOOOO!
He bitterly says to her, ""No, Laleh, I'm getting the Chopped Chavalier salad (what the HELL is THAT?!) with the almonds and tuna...because I HATE ALMONDS AND TUNA!!!""

That made no sense to me. Why get a salad you hate? and what does he have against almonds?! Grrr!

I woke up at that point, and thank heavens I did. This saddens me though, I thought I would make it through without having...

THE TOM GOUGH DREAM!!!!!

AHHHHHHHHH!"

"event","So, I heard on the news tonight that 7-11 is planning to start selling computers.

I'm not sure what this says about the world, or the country. Is it merely that computers are so prevelent that one should EXPECT to see them on the shelves next to ""Oh Boy! Oberto!"" beef jerky?

Or is it that businesses have gone crazy in what they think they can get away with, and 7-11 is wildly overzealous? 

I mean, really... ""I'm just going to stop in for a slurpee and a Laptop."" ??  The company making these computers is one I've never even HEARD of!! WHO is going to buy these?

COMPLETELY UNRELATED....

You make me a better man, you make me look forward to every minute ahead, you know who you are, you make me alive, I love you."

Now, given Oz's affinity for nudity, this is VERY POSSIBLE. PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS TO ME. With One Look, she will break my eyes!!!

"event","So, I've now had about 3 or 4 people tell me that I have this strange power of infusing my pattern of dialect upon them when they speak to me online. In particular, my frequent use of the word ""indeed"" as an affirmation of fact is quite infectious. It would seem that I am single-handedly promoting the use of the word ""indeed"" by people everywhere.

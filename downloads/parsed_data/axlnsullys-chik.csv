"event","Well, I never got in touch with my aunt so I am stuck here in my own private hell.  Well at least I am getting to work on finishing my poetry collection.  I guess I will deal with the issues I have later on, as right now isnt a good time.  I have realized the beauty of the little things around me.  I went to my grandmothers house today, and they have two pit bull puppies that hang around their house, and I spent time with the puppies and I felt better.  Animals have a special way of making a person feel better when they feel low.  I recommend that everyone own at least one pet, because pets can tell when you are upset, and they always come around to check on you.  They listen very well too as funny as it may sound.  I can sit and talk to an animal for hours and feel relieved.  Pets are the best therapy for any problem in my opinion.  They can sometimes fill the void that has been left by the loss of something important to you.  I cant type anymore so Im off for now.

"event","At the moment, I am attempting to get in contact with my aunt who lives in the mountains.  I need a mental health break DESPERATELY, and I feel that her place would be the perfect spot.  I am hoping that I could spend a few days at her place away from my problems and away from most modern technology.  I think the fresh air would do me alot of good, and would inspire me to write down exactly what I feel inside.  This break, if it happens, will be only for a couple of days, but would be one that I would treasure.  There is nothing more relaxing than sitting on a front porch swing looking at the mountains and the clouds, feeling the gentle breeze and listening to the sounds of nature.  Its one of the most beautiful experiences anyone could ever have.  Anyway, I may be gone for a few days, but I will return I guess.  So now Im off to try to get in contact with my aunt.  Everyone take care of yourselves.

"event","Recent events in my life have made me think hard about the person I really am, and the person I want to be.  Currently, I am no where near being what I want to be.  All of this time I thought I was on the right path, I thought that I was figuring life out and that I knew what I wanted and I knew how to treat people.  I have recently discovered that I didnt really know what I wanted, that I didnt really have anything figured out.  I lived for the moment, and I lived selfishly.  I thought the world revolved around me and that I was untouchable.  I have realized that my thinking was wrong.  I used people to make myself feel better.  I talked to people on the internet who made me feel better about myself because I dont get that in real life.  I have always been the person that people come to for help, and I have always helped.  However, when I turned to these people for help, all I got was a blank stare and a laugh.  Even the people I call my family have few positive things to say to me.  I know I've dissappointed my family by not being the perfect female.  I know that because I am not a barbie doll that people dont want to be with me in real life.  I know from experience.  I was talking to this guy once and we went on a date, a blind date, and he told me that he wouldnt date me, but that we could be friends with benefits, and it was all because I am not thin.  This has left me devastated, I thought that people could actually see the real me, the person I am inside, but they cant, not in real life at least.  I have used the internet as a way to make myself feel better, because people get to know the inner me and they liked it.  However, I managed to hurt these people, I managed to screw up any friendship I had with people I truly cared for, even though I have never met them.  I screwed up several times, hurt people who I know were good people.  I dont deserve their friendship.  I only deserve to continue living the life I have always lived, the life full of sorrow, depression and despair.  Maybe since I start college this fall it will be different, but I dont hold much hope for it.  To those who read this that I know I have hurt, I apologize.  I know its only words written down, but they come from my heart.  I cant undo the damage I have done, but I would like to turn the page and move forward.  I promise right here right now, that I will no longer be fake, and no longer use people to make myself feel better.  I have already started taking steps to improve my self esteem, and I am going to stop worrying so much about what others think, and worry more about what I think of myself.  No more will I depend on others to make me happy, I know now that I have to find happiness within myself before I can be happy with others.  So from this point on, the mask I have been wearing is coming off.  From now on, people will see the real me, not the illusion I created to make myself feel better.  Once again, I am sorry for using people, I know it hurt them, and I apologize from the bottom of my heart.  I hope that the slate can be wiped clean, and the page can be turned.  You know who you are and I want to let you all know that I want to work on building a friendship based on truth and honesty.  No more mask.  Im real now.

"event","While I was cleaning my room, and going through old things, I ran across some stuff I had written.  I have decided to go out on a limb and post one of the poems that I found.  I am no poet laureatte, but I try.  Here goes. 

SOLES TO SOULS

the road keeps winding,
the mountainous hike gets steeper,
the soles of the shoes wear down,
the soul within the shoes keeps going

neverending journey
reaching for the top
the fall is far
its do or die

the choice lies ahead
ahead are all the lies
empty promises of happiness
and no will to try

still the soul must journey
till it reaches the top
while the soles are wearing
the journey never stops

"event","I always spend alot of time debating what to write in these entries.  Tonight, I was planning on writing about the beauty of the little things, but that one will have to wait.  Tonight I am going to write about mistakes I have made and the selfishness that I express.  While talking to someone I have hurt, I realized that I made a mistake.  I put myself and my own selfish reasons before someone who means alot to me.  I found some quotes that made me realize how selfish I truly have been.  The less you open your heart to others, 
the more your heart suffers (Deepak Chopra).  This is a statement that I just discovered to be true.  I have always been the type to keep my heart closed off, the type who runs from how they feel, the type who wants more than anything to love, but never can figure out how.  It is possible to give without loving, but it is impossible to love without giving (Richard Braunstein).  This quote also expresses the selfishness that I have often made others a victim of.  This person that I hurt is the example of this quote.  This person opened up to me, and gave to me, but I could not find a way to give back.I regret that deeply.  However, this quote has helped me see what I did wrong. Learn your lessons quickly and move on (Eileen Caddy).  I realized that I have acted as an immature person, and I have learned a great lesson from my actions.  Therefore, this is my final quote for this entry. Maturity begins to grow when you can sense your 
concern for others outweighing your concern for yourself (John Macnaughton).  I have discovered that maturity is something I have been lacking in the past few months, but is something I think I am now acheiving with this entry.  I admit my imperfections, and I admit I screwed up.  I know that I have hurt someone close to me.  I hope that by reading this he will realize the sorrow I feel toward what I did to him.  I also hope that if this person still cares for me, that they will help me work on the issues I have that he and I have discussed, and I hope that we can make it work again, if I havent done too much damage already.  You know who you are, because I told you about this entry, and I want you to know that I am sorry for being selfish, and for being immature in my reasoning.  I made a mistake, and I apologize.  

One heart beating, 
one voice pleading,
knowing that the knife has left you bleeding;
My fears of what you really thought 
made me wonder if my heart could be taught
to trust the words you said that were so kind;
I know now I need to trust if I want to love,
I cant keep my heart hidden with this glove,
If I expect to ever make it back to you;
Sorry for the lies,
and sorry for the pain,
everyday my heart reminded me of your name
But Im the one left to blame.

This is nothing like what I would usually say out loud, or anything I would ever express.  I guess this is a different time now, and I guess Im a different person too.

From my heart,
AnSChik"

"event","I found this quote on the net a few months back, and it has stuck out in my mind.  This morning at around 330 AM, i woke up and I turned on my television.  On my tv set I saw a movie about women of strength, women who made a difference.  This movie was set back in the 1800's American frontier, and dealt with the struggles of keeping a home while the men fought off war and fought for justice.  It also dealt with how only one person can make a difference in an entire state, or nation for that matter.  This movie inspired this entry, but I promise Im not going to talk only about the movie.  The quote that is the title of this entry is one that I think is very true.  People find it easy to sit back and complain about how things are going and how they would change it, but they never take the action they speak of.  This attitude has always pissed me off.  I think that if you want to see something get done, you should get off your ass and see that it gets done.  How do revolutions start? How are revolutionaries brought about? How do people become inspirations to others through their actions? Simple, they have decided to be the change they wanted to see in the world.  Granted, not everyone may agree with the change, but the person still lets the world know that they dont like something and they think it should change.  People like Martin Luther King Jr.,who had a simple dream, and fought to see it become a reality, people who petition those in power to let their voices be heard, the womens suffrage movement, abolitionists,  all started by one person, or a group of people with the same goal in mind; to see a change occur in the world they were living in.  One voice is all it takes, one person willing to stand up and say, I will not be silenced.  People who, even in death, continue to inspire those of generations to come.  I once heard Afeni Shakur, mother of murdered rapper Tupac Shakur state that ""You can kill the revolutionary, but you cannot kill the revolution.""  I remember this statement, and the title statement for the power that they possess.  These statements can be inspirations to people who want to make a difference, but dont think they have the courage to do so.  One voice speaking up is all it takes to see a change occur, it takes only one individual to inspire the multitudes.  This is where greatness and humbleness originate.

"event","Im sure every person who has a parent or some form of older guardian, or for that matter has ever taken part in a conversation with a member of the older generation has heard that phrase.  Has anyone ever really paid attention to what it means though?  Usually the phrase ""back in my day"" is used in a conversation about today's generation and about how this generation has it made, and about how we dont have to work for anything we have.  Well, I can understand where they are coming from, but seeing as how they arent from our generation, how can they truly say that? In my very humble opinion, each and every generation has its own set of struggles and its own set of values that are shaped by the developments of that era.  Today's generation probably does have it easier in the fact that there have been so many advances in technology, medicine, and the economy.  However, adults who start out sentences or conversations with ""back in my day"" are usually speaking out of a prejudice that they have toward our generation.  Granted, occasionally the ""back in my day"" conversations have a lesson to them, usually they are used to make the youth of today feel as though they arent as important as the older generation, that we have never had any struggles to deal with and therefore have no right to complain.  I feel that as far as these conversations usually go, that they are sort of a back and forth banter between groups who, because of an age and generational gap, cannot and will not ever see eye to eye on the struggles of the other.  I believe that the generation of today has its fair share of struggles, just as the generation of yesterday had.  However, I dont think that either group's struggles are greater than the other.  I think that in the end, all of the struggles of the generations even out in some way, shape or form.  The older generations had Vietnam, World War II, or the Great Depression.  Todays generation has 9/11, fears of terrorism in their homeland, and a future with the possibility of having no social security.  I have these ""back in my day"" conversations everyday with members of the older generations, and I always find myself walking away not with learning a lesson about appreciation for what I have, because I already appreciate, but with having a feeling of being a member of a lesser generation.  I think that my generation is a great generation, one that holds the future and can change things for the better or for the worse.  One way to create a better future is for the generations to work together to find a common goal and to work on tommorrow, instead of longing for yesterday.

"event","Well, here I am again, making another entry on this vast plane called the world wide web.  Its interesting how much things have developed even since I was born.  Technology has soared to what we think is its peak, when in reality, the true ""top of the mountain"" hasnt even been discovered.  These days, do people really know what they are striving for? Is the goal of everyday life set so high that it will never be attained? And why do people set such high standards for themselves when they know down deep that they will never, no matter what be able to attain these goals? I think that today's society has blown success completely out of proportion.  What is success exactly? Success is defined by Merriam Webster Online as being the degree or measure of succeeding.  Well, exactly what is succeeding? And who sets the standards of success?  Society? What exactly is society? Society has many definitions, this one is from Merriam Webster Online as well and defines society as a community, nation, or broad grouping of people having common traditions, institutions, and collective activities and interests.  Okay so a group of people get together and decide what success is.  This ""society"" is defining what success is for each individual person.  So ""society"" decides that in order to be important or successful, that you need to go to college, high school, whatever, that you need an education to be successful.  This society tells us that if we arent CEO's or Architects, or lawyers, doctors, ""important"" that we have failed in society.  Also, society tells us to be individuals, yet society sets forth rules that dictate to us to conform.  Success for society is conformity.  Success for me, is finding what I want to do and doing it, regardless of whether or not society thinks it will be a successful career.  Success should be measured by each individual, with each individual determining their own success.  In closing, decide your own success, dont let society decide it for you.  Reach for what you want to attain, not what society wants you to attain.  Always be yourself and make your own path in ""society"",even better, be your own society.  Show everyone else that success doesnt have to be a business suit.

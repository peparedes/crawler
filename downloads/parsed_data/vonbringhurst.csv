"event","So it's been a while since I last posted.

In that time I dated a wonderful guy who ended up cheating on me. Sad, but I know I wasn't in the wrong. 

So I'm single again out of emotional necessity.

I've seen or talked to all of my exes in the past week. Kinda disconcerting.

I also said &quot;fucking&quot; in front of most of my family. Just a lot awkward. *rolls eyes*

Wedding receptions have begun to aggravate me since I don't have that right in this state. This is exacerbated at wedding receptions of born-again Christians, most of whom fall to the extreme right.

I am grateful for good friends who bring over ice cream when they hear about stupid boys' actions.

I am seriously in need of a tabletop RPG fix.

I am done ranting now (I think).

"event","Please tell me that everyone is that neurotic with their first car.

I got a deal on it. It's a NICE car, runs well, has the bells and whistles that I want, and is safe....

Now to find car insurance.

Oh, for those autophiles out there, it is a blue-green 1994 Volvo 850. So nice. I just want to drive and drive and drive and now i can. 

And I'm nervous about people eating in the car because of the leather. So silly of me, but I really want this car to last me.

I was proud of myself, though. In 4 hours, I:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Got the loan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signed the papers;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returned to the bank to finalize the loan;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went to the DMV and licensed the car;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put the plates on the car.

Every time I get in, I just ... feel ... happy. Vroom-happy (I do obey ALL posted speed limits).

Is this what it's always like?"

"event","so last night i called my friend and we decided to hang out. Come to find out I had NO IDEA it was said friend's birthday. My day hadn't been to wonderful . . . so I was basically going to hang out and vent. Mind you, I realized that I was being extraordinarily selfish . . . . not a very pleasant awakening. We talked, worked through some of my issues and some of my friend's . . . and overall I'm feeling, i dunno, a sense of accomplishment.

Strange.

And I'm trying to find a roommate so i can move out . . . and having NO luck. Either the roommate or the apartment doesn't seem to be right.

Anyhow, other than that life is . . . peachy.

"event","I have made goals in my life to be more honest. With myself and with others. 

Sometimes this poses problems. Sometimes the truth hurts. Sometimes others do not want/need to know the full truth immediately. This is life.

Some truths I've learned:

1. People can talk themselves into almost anything
2. Life is beautiful.
3. My greatest fear is being alone forever.
4. As much as things sometimes hurt, it helps me to know I'm alive.
5. There are very few things I honestly say I regret. Learning experiences are great oportunities.
6. Family is important - and fortunately or unfortunately, you're going to have to deal with them for a long time. Might as well get along.
7. Lack of cell service sucks.
8. Lack of communication is even worse.
9. I can be incredibly childish at times. Seriously, like a freakin' junior high girl.

I do not wish to go to a festival or for riches or for physical beauty. Although desirable to some, this is not my primary focus.

I wish for a healthy and loving relationship.

I wish to be happy and each misstep brings me one step closer to my goal.

I wish someone would talk to me, even if it was to say that they don't want to talk to me anymore."

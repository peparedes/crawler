Christmas break is almost over :'(  It's gone by soo fast!  I've had tons of fun though, none of that sitting home and doing nothing crap.  Way too many late nights and early mornings but it's all good.  At least I was having fun.  But yeah tomorrow's the last day and back to school on Tuesday.

School...it SUCKS!!  I'm soo flipping happy we only have one more week and then exams.  Then I'll finally be out of AP Lit!!  And I'll have my huge break right in the middle of the day.  I think it'll make the school day a lot more bearable.  I'm thinking of hitting up lunch with somebody my first or second day since by birhtday is in 11 days!!  It sucks always having exams on my birthday though.  BUT... we only have 1/2 a day so I guess it's not too bad.  Then we have more exams on Friday and then me and Amanda are gonna go get tattoos!  Because we'll be 18.  I just have to tell mom...  Don't know how that'll go but oh well.  She said we can do anything we want when we're 18.  Then Monday is the new semester!  And that's when I'm thinking of going out for lunch.  Good way to start out the last half of my last year in high school.  Shit I can't believe I'm already half done.  

Christmas was good.  New Years was better.  LoL oh man.  

OOH!!  I'm going to visit Nicole at Tri State sometime this month.  Just have to figure out some stuff with some people and we'll be all set.  It'd go a lot faster though if someone CALLED ME BACK.  But yeah I'm totally freaking excited!  

I think that's enough of an update for now though.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","So school starts tomorrow.  That sucks.  I really liked this break too.  I got to hang out and have fun and it was just good.  Tuesday night...did nothing?  Wednesday...babysat with Meg Meg.  Thursday...Thanksgiving and the movies with Meg Meg and Shaina..don't see Derailed.  It's not the kind of movie it looks like.  Lots more blood and killing than I thought.  Friday...hung out with Rachael and Suzie and then Caitlin and Erin and Bruce and Steve and man...long story there about this really bitchy lady.  Saturday...work..long story there too.  Then Megan came over later that night and we watched Monster-in-law even though I've seen it and took all the movies back before 10 because I didn't want a late fee or anything.  Then today I worked.  And I have to go to school tomorrow and I have too much going through my mind and I can't sleep so that's why I'm up.  I was like forget this I might as well get up and get some ice cream and read the paper so I did.  And it's a good thing I did too because Phill and Dave stopped over after work and the door was locked so I let them in.  They scared the crap outta me though.  I was like OMG totally forgot you were coming over.  So I'm all in my sweats and eating right from the ice cream carton and I'm just like hey guys...lol.  Oh well.


So on a dif note...
Mary's gonna name her baby Emma!  That's so cute.  I forgot her middle name but I love the name Emma!!  I can't wait for her baby shower.  It'll be so fun.  And I'm gonna be like an aunt!  Even though I already am.  It's still exciting.  

Called Cory today and he's doing really good.  Told him what was going on at work, everyone misses him, dairy department doesn't look so great anymore.  He said he figured.  Yeah and they changed all the locks and everything which is stupid.  But whatever.  He said to keep in touch and I was like oh I will.  I mean who else am I gonna tell all my stories to?  In the breakroom I'm always telling everyone about my day and what happened and just normal stuff and him and Ben and Cole will just sit there and eat and look through a magazine so I just keep on talking and they're like OMG do you ever just shut up!  This is our break, we just want to sit and eat in peace and you're just yap yap yap.  But they love me  :) And I come up with the most random stuff sometimes.  It's just a gift.          

I miss people from school I didn't see all of break  :(  So I'm happy I get to see everyone tomorrow, not happy I have to go and do work and stuff.  And it's now 12:15 and I still don't even feel tired.  This happened last year too towards the end of the school year.  I'd sit up all night not being able to get to sleep until like 3 in the morning.  And then I'd finally get to sleep and I'd have to get up like 2 hours later and sometimes I'd feel wide awake and other times I could barely get through the day.  So dang I hope that doesn't start again.  I can deal with one night but not when it's like every single week.  I was really tired earlier and then I get to bed and start thinking about things and then I just can't get to sleep.   And UGH it sucks.  But yeah I'm gonna finish up my convo and try and get to sleep.  Ta ta for now!  Lots of Love!!"

THIS FUCKING BLOWS


Ok...Um NHS induction ok I guess.  Little boring.  Thank GOD for Thanksgiving break.  I cannot stand school anymore.  So I think I'm goinig to switch from A.P. Lit and Comp to regular Comp.  And I'm getting a C in Calc right now but after that ""easy point"" thing of checking homework and oh I didn't do it so getting like 3/12 on that and I'm sure I'll fail my test tomorrow so that class is just going down the tubes.  My ""adopted sister"", Mary for those who know what I'm talking about found out today that she's gonna have a baby girl!!  Everyone was hoping it would be so we're all excited.  Her due date is April 16 so eeee I'm excited!  Found out my great aunt has cancer and she's having surgery on Tuesday.  I just found out today but I guess everyone already knew.  Tonight just sucks though.  Don't really feel like updating so I'm just not gonna anymore.  Lots of Love!!"

My sentence: Abbott has been in business for over 100 years.  Yeah gotta love that BUA 100 book.  

This is the last week of my college class!!  Hell yeah!  I only have 2 more chapters to read, one more discussion board to post and then fill out a little survey thing or actually it's more like a response to the class and then I'm gonna be DONE!!  I can't wait to find out what I got on my final.  I thought it was pretty good, well written, very thought out.  So we'll see what she thinks.  

So yeah...

2 hour delay tomorrow!!  McDonalds @ 9 for sure.  Just in case anyone wants to come.  Then tomorrow after school I'm getting my hair cut.  Not very short, just trimming off all the dead ends and stuff.  Maybe I should get it highlighted or something...hmmm I don't know.  We'll see.  I'll talk to my hair lady about some options.  

Mix it Up day...our school's attempt to de-clique us.  News flash: Not gonna happen.  You can make us eat lunch together for a day, but that doesn't mean we're gonna be friends afterwards.  You'll get to know someone more maybe and be like huh they're not a bad person.  Doesn't mean you'll ever talk to them again.  So whatever.  I just sat with my friends like always and the table that sits behind us, more friends, joined our table so it was like a joining of tables, not really mixing it up.  

Yeah I gotta go read a book for a literary analysis that's due Friday.  And it's like super small print, 600 pages.  But I don't have anything planned the rest of the week so I can dedicate it to that and reading Frankenstein which needs to be ready by Monday.  I'm tellin ya right now: DON'T TAKE AP LIT AND COMP AS A SENIOR!  Or calculus for that matter.  They're both SUPER hard and you're just gonna wanna hang out with your friends senior year and do fun stuff, not school work.  So don't take those classes.  Ok, going to work on my LOADS of homework.  Sleep in tomorrow!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Oh wow I just watched the season finale of Laguna Beach!!  Yeah I def cried.  It just makes me think about going to college  :(  

I talked to Aubrey tonight and she was like we'd better not lose contact even when we're in college.  She's like I'm gonna be mad if you don't call me!!  It's just weird knowing that everyone will be going separate ways and I'm gonna make new friends.  I like the friends I have now.  

Yeah and Tate said that this is our senior year and we should be getting closer instead of drifting apart and it's like I'm already driftiing away from some of my closest friends.  If I can't even make the time for them now when they're still here, how am I gonna do it when they're not here and I don't see them everyday?  I think I'm going through some kind of crisis or something.  

It's been sooo long since I've hung out with Tate and we're supposed to be best friends.  Like the last time I did was at Megan's birthday party and before that I can't even remember.  Labor day weekend??  If she's not working then I am and if I'm not working then she has her college class and it's like I need an extra day in the week just dedicated to hanging out with her.  Weekends are always busy, weeknights are pretty busy.  I mean like when am I supposed to find the time to?  And then tonight when she didn't have to work I had to and Wed night she has college and then she has to work tues, thurs, fri, sat and I have to work Sunday.  Seriously, things just aren't working out.  Ugh it sucks!!  I don't even know what's really happening in her life.  I know she's been going out with Stephan for over a month now and it's like whoa I haven't ever met him.  Obviously he can't be too bad of a guy though.  And then Tate has work work work work work and college and hanging out with Steve.  I don't know everything just sucks right now.  So I've been hanging out with Megan lately because I mean she has her college class on Thursday night but other than that she's usually pretty free.  But her and Shaina are best friends so it's like just friends hanging out and having fun not like best friend stuff.  She's just not Caitlin.  I used to have a story for Tate like everyday and we'd laugh and make fun of someone or something and have our own little inside jokes only we understood and now it's like I have so much backed up to tell her I don't even know where to start.  We did have a pretty good laugh at the sub today though.  Oh boy!!  He's kinda weird though!  No, really weird.  But still all we do anymore is be like hey and stuff and just small talk and that's it.  It just sucks.  This is supposed to be the best time of my life right now, big bad seniors, tons of fun all the time.  And it's not.  I have sooo much homework all the time, college, work, committees, that pretty much takes up about all of my time.  This year is supposed to be fun.  

A bunch of people are going to Bob Evans for breakfast on Wed and I thought about going but it's at 7:30 so I'd have to wake up waaaay earlier than normal so I don't know.  Maybe me and Tate should just hit up McDonalds at like 9 and then we can finally hang out and talk and it won't be so stinking eaerly because I'm sorry but my delay is for me to sleep in and right now I really need it.  So I think I'll ask tomorrow.  That way we'd still get to sleep in but we could ya know ""go out for breakfast"" like everyone else does and it'd be fun.  Sooo...
Yeah sounds like a plan to me!

I think I'm going to go to bed.  It's now 11:20 and I didn't go to bed until like mdnight last night.  I submitted my college final at like 11:30 and it's due before midnight so heck yeah for half an hour!!  Alrighty I'm outta here and hittin up the bed.  Lots of Love!!"

Right now I am waiting for Megan to get online or call me or SOMETHING!!  That girl is like impossible to get ahold of whenever I like really need to.  But tomorrow should be fun.  I'm hanging out with her and Mark tomorrow and we're gonna go ice skating and that's all I know of right now because she HASN'T CALLED ME!!  I don't even know if we're supposed to go pick him up or anything but yeah I'm thinking mom would like to know what I'm doing and where I'm going.  Oh well she knows we're going out and doing stuff.  

While I'm waiting for Megan, I'm working on my senior pics.  So if you didn't pick one out yet which not a lot of people did because I did it for a few days and then just kinda forgot then let me know and I'll get ya all set up!  I haven't even written messages on them or anything yet so don't expect them for a while.  I'm quite a procrastinator.  

I am getting excited about graduating!  Turning in all my graduation order stuff for like announcements and thank you notes and all that jazz.  It just makes me wanna graduate right now!!  And then I can freaking be done with school.  Ugh!!  Seriously, if I didn't have math or english, my life would be soo much better.  I HATE those classes.  They SUCK!!  Big time.  I def already have senioritis.  I mean part of me is still like this is my last year, tear but the other part of me is like I WANT OUT!!  

I talked to Brent the other night and I haven't talked to him in FOREVER!!  So that was nice.  Love ya!

Oh and in P.E. the other day I got hit in the leg twice with a ball when we were playing handball and those left bruises and then I got smacked right in the head.  That is a dangerous class I'm tellin ya!  Especially them guys, they just like throw that ball as hard as they can.  

And I talked to Jessy Rose the other night for those of you who remember her, prolly not a lot of people.  Waaaay back in middle school but some ppl saw her last year at our last band concert.  So that was cool.  She's a BAND GEEK!

I'm freaking TIRED!  I'm waiting to see if Megan will call though but if not I guess I'll just go to bed and she can call me in the middle of the night if she wants to which she prolly won't even though I've told her it's fine to.  She doesn't believe me or something.  IF ANYONE WANTS TO CALL ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT GO RIGHT AHEAD.  Only if it's something worthwhile though, not like yeah just thought I'd wake you up, haha.  Umm..no.  I'm usually up late anyways.  I seriously think I'm gonna go to bed though.  Lots of Love!!"

My weekend was ok I guess.

Friday - babysat.  Kids were actually good.  Me and Megan were tossing around a football outside after they were in bed and it was dark and scary and these dogs started barking and Megan was like yeah they're guard dogs...the guy works at the prison and so do the dogs and I'm like ok so if they get out they're just gonna like KILL US!!  Then this guy came home and was like there's a cougar!!  I freaked because I didn't know anyone was there and didn't hear the guy drive up or anything and I was like omg a cougar.  LoL so I bolted for the door.  Then we went inside and watched Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants.  It was soo good!!  I read the books though so I knew what would happen but still the whole story line is just so cute!  I think I'm gonna cry!  LoL I said that like 5 times during the movie.  Megan was like Cindy...stop it.  I'm gonna hit you.  Yeah it was fun though.  Except when their dad came home at 2:45 in the morning and was fighting with someone over the phone and we both kinda woke up.  But yeah it was fun.  

Sat - worked.  All I ever do is work or that's what it seems like.  Came home and took a shower and mom and dad went out to eat with some friends in Battle Creek and me and Shaina were gonna stay home and watch Hunter but then I went to the movies with Ryan instead and Jill and Jon.  We watched Saw 2 and it was fricking SCARY!!  I hate scary movies.  I had my face covered like the whole time.  Idk everyone said the first one was scarier but I didn't see it and don't really want to.  But yeah there's so gonna be another one.  It was a good movie, just super scary.  And the line was freaking loooooooong.  I missed the first few minutes of the movie but that's ok.    

Today-worked.  All freaking day.  10-6.  So I came home and did my college homework and now I don't feel like doing my reg high school homework because I'm tired so I'm gonna go to bed.  Hopefully tomorrow won't be too bad without doing my homework.  As long as we don't have a homework check 2nd hour I'll be ok and 5th hour probably won't be good.  I didn't exactly read the whole book.  More like the first 30 pages out of about 600.  And I didn't finish the essays we were supposed to.  So yeah...  Hopefully it'll be ok though.  Well I'm off to bed.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hey how is everyone?  I've been a little sick lately, not really, just a stuffy nose and stuff ya know.  And I've been babysitting a TON!  Dang.  LoL  I never babysit and then I did Wednesday night with Megan and last night with Aubrey and then tonight with Megan and I might have to watch my brother tomorrow night.  I hope not so I can go to the play but we'll see.  So yeah I've been pretty busy.

I'm waiting for mom to call right now so I can go get my book from the library that I need to read for AP Lit.  Yeah it's due Monday and it's freaking long.  But they didn't have it in and the bookstores didn't have it so what else was I supposed to do?  So I have a lot of reading to do today, tomorrow, and Sunday.  

Totally bombed my math test yesterday.  Hopefully did better on my physics one.  Talked to someone at work last night and they're gonna try to get me working Thursday nights again instead of Wed.  No more John!!  YAY!  Then me and Aubrey ate at Applebees and then babysat from 6:30-10:30.  He was a really good kid though so it was easy.  

Tonight I'm babysitting with Megan from like 7 or 7:30 ish to like 8 tomorrow morning.  Then I have to work from 10-4 tomorrow.  Yeah it'll be a loooong weekend.

"event","Hey I'm back!!

Well, I had a lot of fun.  There were a few things...but overall it wasn't that bad.

I can't wait to:
Sleep in my own bed that's wider than 2 feet
Take a HOT shower, not just kinda warm
Wake up warm instead of shivering
Get some sleep!  Def didn't get a lot
Leave whatever I want to on my plate (you're right jake, that's kinda brainwashing (had to have been there))
Be around ppl my own age!

The kids weren't really that bad.  Most of them weren't anyways.  There were a few that were just ahhhh!!  I wanted to just leave them there.  My girls were great.  There were 3 that kinda were a group on their own but everyone got along ok and survived 3 days being with eachother.  Then the 3 that were always together were in my ""travel group"" along with 8 other boys and Dan Layton.  And I soon figured out why there were 2 councelors when some groups only had 1.  Because they freaking have behavior problems!!  They would not be quiet and just listen to the councelors tha work there and they were always arguing and being loud.  The first night was the absolute worst.  Then we had a ""talk"" with them, mostly Dan, and they were better yesterday and today.  Haha my girls were like we don't like Dan, he's mean.  Then one of them was like Dirty Dan.  So tha was his nickname and I still don't think he knows why.  It was funny though.  The kids were soo cute though!!  They said the funniest things.  

The teachers honestly thought that they'd sleep on the way home because there were all tired and no one had wanted to get up in the morning.  They didn't wanna wake up the first morning either but they have like a nonstop energy supply.  So they're all like oh we don't wanna get up but once they are, they forget about being tired.  So we were like uh...ok sure.  If that's what you wanna believe, go right ahead.  So yeah they were just as wound up on the bus as any other day.  There were a few that tried to sleep but the only ppl that really did were us councelors.  

Then we had all the girls in Jake's travel group who thought he was just the hottest thing ever.  This one girl said something about him one night and she was like yeah I like him and I told him.  I was like ok...  Then we had skit night and their skit was like getting ready for bed and stuff and so they're all sitting around talking and someone was like you know Jake, the councelor, and they're all giggling and they were like he is so hot!  I was like awww poor Jake.  It was funny though.  Then today at lunch they gave all of us councelors teddy bears that the kids in our groups could sign and stuff and everybody that signed his had a little heart by their name.  It was kinda cute.

I had to deal with all kinds of 5th grade drama too.  I had one girl upset because this other girl said she didn't like her and they fight all the time and then they were friends and stuff so I don't know.  Just your average friend problems.  Then I had lots of girls upset because other girls were saying they like all these boys and they didn't and ppl were asking out ppl for ppl and I was like omg you guys stop.  I told them at dancing that I don't care who likes who or who doesn't but I don't wanna hear anymore about the boys and who's dating or whatever.  They were just getting mad at eachother and stuff and I didn't want anyone talking about boys to boys so they were better after that.  Thank goodness.  Then we had at least 3 kids I know of that threw up.  One of the girls in my cabin on Jeanine's side had a bloody nose so we had Mr. Raehtz and one of the ppl that work there and another lady that I don't even know where she came from because I didn't see her at camp at all except for that one night all in the cabin.  It was crazy.  And there were tons of kids crying all week!!  Mostly boys.  I was like omg how do these ppl do it.  I even asked one of the counselors that like works there how they do it because I wouldn't be able to.  He was like oh you just learn how to deal with them.  Then when you learn how to deal with them, they're much better.  He said don't let the chaos get to you.  I was like yeah right.  I'm too much of a control freak.  But I got through it.  There were lots of fun stuff too.  It's not like the entire trip was horrible.  Just those few things.

Some of the girls in my cabin were really sweet.  I was like aww I just love you guys!!  They listened to me and did what I said and got around for bed and showered when they were supposed to and were just really good.  Then I had Victoria.  She was pretty awesome.  I woke up at 6 so I could get showered and everything so when the girls woke up at 7 I could get them around and everything and keep them moving.  So the first day Victoria woke up at like 6:40 and came in and talked for a min and then went back out.  Then at like 7 she came back in the bathroom and was like want me to get the girls up so I was like yeah you can if you want to so she went out and just turned on the light and was like get up ppl!!  Then today she did basically the same thing except she went around tickling ppl.  I was like you're awesome!!  Kyleigh was just funny.  She was said the cutest stuff without meaning to.  Then she slept in her clothes last night because she didn't feel like putting her pajamas on.  So I was like fine then sleep in your clothes and she did.  Then Alyssa Fletcher was just good.  She was quiet, wanted to go to sleep on time, had little footsie pajamas, and did everything you said.  She was sweet.  Gabby was tall!!  She was just big for her age.  I was like dang!  Frances was like Gabby's swimsuit top is bigger than yours.  I was like yeah...thanks.  Gabby was cool though.  Alyssa Hayner, Frances, and Jordyn were the groupies.  They did everything together.  So that was my cabin.

I did dodgeball both days during our free time.  That was fun!  I was like alright I can actually hit people because they're way smaller than me.  So yeah I was getting people out right and left.  The second day there were a lot more ppl but it was still fun.  The food was good too!!  Dang!  OMG and I did archery.  It was fun!!  And using a compact bow? I think that's what it's called yeah I got 2 arrows in the yellow section.  Not right smack dab in the middle but still.  It was like yellow section, red section around that, and blue around that.  So I was like alright I got two.  It was pretty close though but still.  Then I def did not get very far on the rock wall.  Alyssa made it to the very top!  I was so proud of her.  I made it up the latter onto the wall and about 3 steps up and then I was like ok that's too high I'm coming back down.  Even though it was only like 13 feet maybe.  At the most.  It looked super high.  Dino made it to the top too and Dan but he doesn't count.  Then we had dancing one night and I danced.  Then we did canoeing!  That was fun.  Me and Dan were awesome, but that was a given.  Two of our kids almost flipped their canoe over.  I was like OMG YOU GUYS!!  All the kids were like leaning to whatever side they were rowing on though so then the whole canoe would lean that way.  It was kinda funny because they didn't really realize they were doing it.  Everyone stayed dry though.  Except Brogan who I think just got splashed from rowing.  We had to go on a 4 mile bog hike this morning.  It was frcking freezing and they were tired of walking and it wasn't that great.  The bog was pretty cool but the walk and the weather made it not so good.  We played lots of fun games and did lots of cool activities.  It was pretty awesome.


OK...

Tomorrow is paintballing.  So I need to call RJ like right now.  Then Ben was like are you gonna stay after paintball and just hang out and I was like ummm... I don't know.  So we'll see.  And then Blast! tomorrow night.  That'll be cool.  Then work Sunday 10-6 and TONS of homework.  So I have a pretty full and busy weekend.  But I think I'm gonna go call RJ and find out where he is so I can pick him up tomorrow morning and then go to bed.  Because I'm freaking tired!!  So I will see everyone Monday at school and talk to you guys later!  Lots of Love!!"

Worked 9-7:30 today.  Freaking awesome.  Gotta get hours somehow though since whenever I ask for like a few days off he doesn't ever give me any.  So I worked today, work Wed, and work next Sunday.  Whatever.

Tomorrow: Bow-a-thon.  Still need to get my $50.  Mom will give me some and I'll just cover the rest.  I might need to go to the bank though...

Tuesday: YAC 4-5, no biggie

Wed: MEGAN'S BIRTHDAY!!!  work 4-9 maybe 10 ish??

Thurs: Jake's hockey game

Fri: football game @ Northwest   Cheering on # 31 and #72.  Woo!!  It's the last game though so I figured I might as well.  It's not that far away.

Saturday: Megan's party!  which means sometime ^^ I need to do some shopping.  It'll be fun though.

Sunday: Work 10-6.  Sucks.  I've worked 9-3 the last couple months.  And then they just go and change it one me.  But it's just cuz Nicole is back so I won't complain too much.  It was fun Friday with me, her, Shelly, and Vickie working.  Poor Erik.  She's working on the weekends though because she comes back all the time anyways so might as well make some money.

Sometime this week I have to:
clean my room - majorly.  or else i won't be going anywhere.
do my college homework - big paper due by sunday plus read two chapters and do the quizzes.  def can't be doing that all sunday night.
go shopping for a halloween costume - any ideas about what i should be??

not really a whole lot but it kinda is.

anyways, i'm going to bed.  i'm freaking tired and have had a looong day.  a looong weekend.  Lots of Love!!  nite nite"

"event","Ok so yeah.  Band trip definately isn't to Atlanta anymore.  We're going to Chicago because it's cheaper and more ppl can go.  Whatever.  I signed up to go to ATLANTA, not Chicago.  It's only gonna be around $350 now instead of $600+ so more ppl said they'd be able to do that.  UGH!!!  It'll still be fun with our friends and stuff but still I'm not very happy.  I could go to Chicago for the weekend if I wanted to because it's like really close to where we live.  And now we're leaving Wed morning instead of Tuesday night and we're getting back Friday night instead of Saturday night but it's still the same week.  So it's gonna be shorter too.  We'll be there Wed, Thurs, and Friday and then coming back.  They better have lots of fun stuff to do and have time for shopping, that's all I gotta say.  At least the rest of the $250 that should've gone towards the trip I can just put towards spending money.  Yep I'm just a little mad right now though.  That's all I really had to say.  Hope you have a better day than me.  Oh and my guinea pig died.  Yeah today is even worse than yesterday I think.  She was my little baby.  She was like 6 or 7 though so that's old for a guinea pig.  Still though.  So I'm really not in the best mood today.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  I don't see how it can get any worse than these past few days.  Ok I'm going.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Ugh testing today.  It sucked.  I had to get up freaking early to be there by the normal time school starts, I had really bad cramps, and the test was stupid.  Who really cares if you know how a car works.  That's why they have mechanics.  So they can fix it for you.  There were questions on mechanics, electricity, shop, currents, I mean really.  I don't know any of that stuff.  But the first part was pretty easy.  Basic math, reading, it wasn't hard.  Then we got done an hour early and just hung out in the gym playing volleyball and talking and yeah.  But school basically sucked today and now I have to work from 4-9.  I just wanna go to bed right now and not get up until tomorrow when it's time for school.  

Forgot my math book last night so def didn't do my math homework.  Good thing I didn't have that class today.  But now I have to do it all tonight and look over Act II of Macbeth.  Tomorrow, Key Club.  That's about it.  Might go to Jake's game, we'll see.  Friday - work.  Suck ass.  It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't our meat sale but it is and they GROSS ME OUT!!  Then I have to work Saturday morning now and then after that going shopping with mommy and then maybe to the movies.  Not with mom.  But I don't know.  And then working Sunday.  So my weekend basically consists of working.

Yesterday was our 5th grade camp counselor meeting.  I'm getting really excited!!  I think it'll be fun.  I hope my phone gets service up there though.  If it doesn't, that's gonna suck.  Yeah the sheet said like not to bring cards, food, money, cosmetics or hair products, and electronics only for the bus ride.  Yeah right I'm bringing like all of those things.  I mean I need my hair stuff.  I don't care if it is just camp and we're all scrubbing it.  My hair is like a fro if I don't have stuff in it.  But it'll be fun anyways.  Going with Warner are me, Osha Jackman, Jena Garnett, Jeannine Mick, Jessica Cottingham, Andrea Wynn, Dan Layton, Bobby Ganton, Derek Copp, Jeff Chambers, Alan McCrum, and Jake Sinkovitz.  So yeah we'll have fun.  And it's on Wed, Thurs, Fri so then it'll be the weekend when we come back.  I have a few things to get before then though like a rain poncho thingy because I have a feeling it'll prolly be rainy.  I hope not, but it prolly will be.  And a disposable camera.  Maybe 2.  I take lots of pics.  Yay it's only 2 weeks away though!!


Well, time to go do some homework so I can sleep when I get home tonight.  Lots of Love!!"

Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 
The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 
There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.

You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 
Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 
You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 

You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 
Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 
You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 
You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>

"event","Ok another update.  I don't really update very often anymore but when I do they're long so yeah...get ready!!

Homecoming was lots of fun!!  Very emotional being my last one and all but that's ok.  I got through it.  After halftime I started crying because I was like omg this is the last time I'm ever gonna march at a football game and I like marching so much better than normal band and it was senior night and everything and us seniors were having so much fun and yeah I just started crying.  So John wanted all the trombones to meet afterwards so we could ""row"" back to the bandroom and be silly and so I was like ok so me and him were leading the lines and my mouthpiece fell off so I turned around into a bunch of ppl to get it and got it and was running back to the front between the two lines and I def tripped over Laura's trombone and fell, just about flat on my face.  So I pick myself up, yell at some kid that kicked my mouthpiece I was like JUST GIVE ME MY MOUTHPIECE and yeah my knees were burning and I didn't really look at them until I got in the bandroom and my jeans were ripped and my knees were bleeding and I was crying and everyone was like are you ok and I'm like yeah I was already crying so it just wasn't good.  And mom said she was gonna stay until the end of the game and everyone was going home to get ready for the dance and I was like I don't know what to do!  So I went to Hutch's and yeah everyone got me all fixed up.  They wrapped them up and everything and I was like thank goodness I have a long dress.  So yeah I couldn't ""get down"" very far because I was in a little bit of pain but I still had fun.  And then I cried on the way home too.  It was just a crazy night.

Then I had to work the rest of the weekend.  Yeah...fun.  Oh and our phone lines def weren't working so I couldn't do my college homework so I had to go to Megan's and I thought I left my book in my locker so I didn't have it with me and had to take my test without even reading the book.  So I was at Megan's for a while.  On Sunday night.  Then I had to go home and go to bed.  

COngratulations to Devin and Hannah!!  I def voted for both of them.  

Mom and Dad left for Vegas Wed morning and they just came home tonight.  Grandma Sally stayed with us though, so I couldn't have a big party like everyone wanted me to.  LoL.  But yeah I was out a lot and not even really home.  Work Wednesday, party at work Thursday, work Friday.  Party was fun, cake, ice cream, balloons, confetti.  Cory's 21 now.  Lots more partying a lot closer.  Friday was sooo fun!!  I had a class meeting and we got done like 3:30 so I just went to work early and was gonna clean out my car.  So I get there and I'm like that looks like Nicole's car and then I was like and Shelly's here prolly out back smoking and then I saw her in her car so I went over and Nicole was there too and Shelly's like hop in!  So we're all sitting and talking and laughing and it was really fun.  Then we all went to work and I think Nicole is gonna start working there on the weekends because she's always home and hey might as well make some money.  So I hope she does!!  Me and Shelly were being goofy all night though just having fun.  Then at 9 when I left, I heard someone across the street screaming and I was like that looks like Aubrey so I went over there and I was like what the hell are you doing.  I heard you all the way across the street.   She was like oh I was just like IT FEELS GOOD OUT HERE!!  And then Shelly came so we're all sitting around talking because there's no one there at like 9:30 and Shelly was buying us lotto tickets and we were scratching them off and stuff and then she left and I was doing my bingo and I won $2 but I couldn't turn it in because I'm not 18!!  So I have to get someone to do that for me sometime.  Actually I just want another Bingo thingy.  I'm gonna get so addicted to those things.  But they're just so fun!!  

Yeah hope everyone is having fun at Eric's house!!  Sorry I'm not there.  I just needed a chill out night and mom and dad just got back so yeah.  Maybe next party.  Hi to everyone there!!

Umm yeah have to work tomorrow 9-3 and then I'm getting my ass home and doing homework.  Because I have  a lot of it.  So nite nite everyone!!  Oh and I love you Tate!!  Yay!!  LOL.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Well I haven't really updated in a while and thought since I have nothing better to do tonight at 11:11 (except make a wish!) I just thought I would.  

Spirit week!!  I've done all the days and I'm doing tomorrow so that'll be like the first time every I've done the entire week!  Yay it's a feeling of accomplishment.  And our last home football game is tomorrow night  :(  And our last band show  :(   And our last Homecoming  :(  At least for us seniors anyways.  I'm getting my hair done at 5:00 so hopefully I'll be back to the school by 6.  I should be.  But I also have to go get a band t-shirt.  Yay for senior show and wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  And our formal assembly is tomorrow 6th hour and then voting for King and Queen and then 7th hour is our pep assemble and I'm playing hockey.  Yay for being involved!!  I think it'll be fun, I don't see why no one else does.  I'm gonna so be crying tomorrow night.  You have no idea.  I think I might start crying now.  Ok let's move on to happier things. 

Umm...not a whole lot going on.  Work, school, the usual.  I talked to Aubrey last night when I was getting gas.  Yay for that!  And Cory who showed up too out of nowhere.  He's kinda weird like that.  So that was cool except I got home a little late but ya know it's all ok.  Mom didn't say anything.  

I had to work until 10 tonight instead of 8 so Vickie could go home early.  Just because I'm nice like that.  And I made the guys listen to my car because it definately clunks and stuff and it kinda scares me and yeah they said it's prolly my engine and it might blow up.  Not literally but kinda like explode and it'll just shut down and everything but it won't blow the whole car up and kill me.  No no.  So that's good that I won't die or anything but not good that it's gonna stop working soon.  But mom said when it does they'll just get me a new one because it'll be cheaper than putting tons of money into it because something else is always wrong with it.  Stupid piece of shit car.  So yeah that was my night.  And we had pizza and I don't think it was setting well with Cole because he was smelly all night long and it was gross.  He'd be like come here and I'd be like what and he was like does it smell and I was like I don't know and he was like I think it does, take a big whiff and I would and I was like yeah kinda and he was like it should because I just FARTED and then laugh and run away.  ALL FREAKING NIGHT!!  It was really gross.  Everyone was tired though.  I was going around to everyone and drawing a smiley face on their arm with a red permanent marker but they didn't appreciate that very much so mostly I just got the eyes.  But it was ok. 

In school we're watching this old movie of Hamlet and it's in black and white and it's really funny but really boring.  It's only funny because it's so old and they like over dramatize everything.  Oh I need to bring in popcorn tomorrow.  I'd better go put that in my bag right now.  And 6th hour is super boring.  Physics.  Or Fizzicks as Alyson would say.  Or write.  Or whatever.  Yeah thinking of Alyson makes me think of band which makes me wanna cry.  So I think I'm gonna go put some popcorn in my bag and go to bed.  Tomorrow is school spirit day!!  Yay for that.  Oh and Shaina got new glasses today so tell her tomorrow how cute they are because they are.  She looks totally hot in them.  Only I can say that though.  Yeah I'm gonna go to bed though.  Man I think my feet smell.  It's kinda grossing me out.  Yeah though, NITE NITE!!  Lots of Love!!

Ooooh I am totally in love with this song even though it's country.  I kinda like country now.  Some songs.  

Georgia Rain

Barefoot in the bed of your truck
On a blanket looking up
Half a moon peaking down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneaking out again
Heard the thunder rolling in
We were falling the moment when
It all came pouring down

The Georgia rain on the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away what I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothing in our way 
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
A flash of lightning drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was pounding more
The heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in and storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain on the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away all the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing 
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind 
Same old house I grew up in
I can't believe I'm back again 
After all these years away
You fixed your daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made yourself a real good life
What else can I say

The Georgia rain on the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away the way I've loved you to this day
The old dirt road's paved over now
Nothing here's the same
Except for the Georgia rain

Oooh I love it!!"

I have class officer stuff, Key Club, SADD, YAC, work, homework, a college class.  This is not gonna be good.  Last night already I worked until 10 and then was up until 1 doing homework.  At least this year I don't have 1st hour and can sleep in a little bit but I just can't do this the whole year.  

Tonight should be fun though.  Marching at the football game and then the dance.  Yay!  Then home to sleep.  Then work tomorrow night.  It won't be too bad though.  I'm already tired though.  I'll prolly be falling asleep in the stands.  Wait no me and Megan are gonna have STORY TIME!!!  LoL then get on our dance pants.  Great great conversations.  LoL.  

Ugh this whole situation sucks.

Yeah news of the week: me and Aubrey were kinda fighting but everything's ok now.  And that's the extent of my news.  I think I just really need to talk to Megan.  That'll make things better.  But right now I need to go get around for band.  Yipee!!  And wait for Meg Meg to call back because she said she's not going to the dance now :(  

But yeah I'm really tired and don't feel like writing in this right now.  I'll write everyone comments later and yeah.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","My Weekend:  By Cindy Rees

It all started Thursday night.  Football game.  Tons of fun marching, football team didn't do so hot though.  Lost my music, freaked out, but people found it thank goodness.  Um rowing and roller coaster and the wave.  They were all fun.  I kinda lost my voice a little bit from yelling so much and having fun.  Then after that we went to Rachael's and hung out until like 2:30 and then went to sleep.  Woke up around 10:30 ish and went home.  So now it's on to Friday.

Friday was a lazy day.  Went home, slept, woke up for a while, watched movies, went to bed.  Yeah really exciting there.

Saturday, slept in, woke up, pretty much did nothing.  Went to work, got out early, went to the fireworks, went to Caitlin's.  Hung out, chilled, went swimming, had to come home at 12:30.  

So when I got home I went to bed and then woke up this morning and worked from 9-7:30 and now I'm home.  Trying to find out where the hell Aubrey is.    

Tomorrow I have to work from 4-10 and before that clean my room and do my homework.  Yep it'll be fun.  NOT!  But it won't be that bad.  Just relaxing.  Kinda.  

But yeah I'm gonna go get something to eat.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Wow I've been in school for a whole week already!!  And I've got loads of homework already.  It sucks.  But I think I'm getting more used to it.  Except for the whole sleep thing.  I still come home and take naps.  Normally I'd already be used to it by now but for some reason I'm just not.  So I'm always tired.  LoL.  And I'm always complaining about how sore I am from P.E.  You've prolly all heard me by now.  My stomach hurts from crunches and sit ups and stuff like that and my arms from push ups and the weight room stuff and my legs from running and weight room stuff.  Haha.  Hopefully I'll get better about it.  It's just cuz I'm used to like no physical activity at all.      

Ummm this weekend is definately going to be fun!!  First of all we have a football game tomorrow night!!  Even if you know our team doesn't win as many as the other teams, it's still fun to go and cheer them on and just hang out on a Friday night.  Or in this case Thursday night.  Then after the game party at Rachael's!!  After we like march and everything because yes I'm a proud memember of our marching band!!  Then Friday is free right now.  Maybe shopping or something.  Then Saturday, work from 4-10, but I think I'll be able to get out at 9.  Then fireworks.  Then Tate's house for a party.  Yay for parties!!  Then prolly there all night and work the next morning at 9.  :(  That's gonna suck having to get up early.  But I'll survive because I can come home and crash and sleep on Monday.  So yes I'm excited.  Lots of FUN!!  Boy-girl, spending the night, skinny dipping, bonfire, hanging out, talking, food.  Can't get much better than that.  

I have to work tonight.  That sucks.  So I should prolly go start on my homework right now.  So I can get it done before I have to work so then when I get out at 8 I can come home and go to bed.  And I'll have to be first cashier tonight because I always am when John works unless it's like a Sunday.  But Cole will stay up front with me because yeah we don't like having to go do other stuff when it's John.  So we just kinda talk about stuff and act like we're doing something.  We're smart like that.  

Yep just an update to say that school sucks but I'm hanging in there.  Maybe it'll be better after this long weekend.  But I doubt it.  Yay fun this weekend.  That's about it.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Today was only the second day of school.  I was talking to Teresa at work and I was like yeah we started Wednesdsay and she was like yesterday?  And I was like oh yeah I guess so.  It just seems a lot longer.  But I don't know.  Right now I am just in a mood to get my shit done and get all nice and organized.  So I think I will do that as soon as I'm done with this.

After school got out for me at about 1:40, I got a community service sheet and took it to work for Cory to sign so I now have my first 2 hours of community service!!  And I got my check and some stuff for school, actually Key Club.  I got a 3 ring binder and a folder and then a notebook just because all of mine like you can't rip off the pages without getting all the little stuff at the end.  And it's annoying.  So I got some dif ones.  And some cool paper clips to hold my music down for band so it doesn't all fall out.  They're really cute though and like different colors.  So yeah that was that.

Then I came home and did some of my homework (shocking) and then went to the bank and cashed my check and went to the gas station and the guy asked me what my name was and I'm like always in there and stuff so now I feel like I go there too much and he thinks I'm weird or something but whatever.  So that gave me a good laugh.  And then I went and talked to Josie for a while.  About lots of stuff.  But then I HAD to get home so I had to cut that short.  But I'll talk to her tomorrow night.  Ugh stuff is just so confusing.  

Hmmm...JV football game tonight.  I might go.  We'll see.  And people think it's stupid that we start school before everyone else but hello isn't it nice like getting used to your classes for a few days and then having the weekend and then starting to settle down.  Yeah.  Instead of just starting off a week of school.  So don't be complaining about it because it's nice.  

And yeah the other night Cole wanted me to switch him my Thursday for his Friday so I had to talk to mom because I'm supposed to be watching Hunter Friday night for a little bit so I had to talk to her and then I had to talk to Erik to see if it was ok if I was a little late so finally I was like ok I guess.  And then Cassie came in and wanted me to work Saturday morning 10-4 for her and I was like ehh because me and Megan were gonna go see Mark so then I had to call Megan and her mom was kinda iffy about it and I was like maybe it's better if you do go by yourself so you can spend time with him and maybe spend the night so then I called Cassie and was like ok I guess so.  So I went from working Wed, Thurs 4-8 each night and Sunday 9-3 to working Wed 4-8, Friday 4-10, Sat 10-4, and Sun 9-3.  So my entire weekend will be spent working.  If you wanna see me, it'll prolly have to be at work.  And then Saturday I have to go shopping sometime.  Hopefully I'll be getting a nice, fat paycheck for all of that.  

But yeah I'm gonna go organize myself for this school year and do lots of fun stuff!  Hhaah   Lots of Love!!"

"event","Today was my last ""first day back to school"" ever!!  There's gonna be no more back-to-school for me.  At least not back to Western High.  I'm kinda sad.  But the day was ok.  Mr. Rogers is my homeroom teacher, and we went to our homerooms today and not to the gym :(   The gym is like a tradition.  The seniors sit in the student section and yeah we didn't get to.  But then after we were dismissed to first hour, me and Shaina just hung around and walked the hallways doing nothing.  Then second hour, Calc, it was pretty fun.  I think it'll be a fun class because it's all seniors.  And Megan is in that class so yeah we were having all kinds of fun and just goofing around.  Other than that we just filled out stuff.  Band, marching, usual stuff.  4th hour strength and conditioning.  That class will be interesting.  Maybe I'll actually get muscles.  Everts is in that class so yeah.  There's like 6 or 8 girls maybe and the rest are guys so we're def outnumbered.  I don't think the class will be that hard though.  Then lunch.  SECOND LUNCH IS FRICKING CROWDED!!  Like half the school has that lunch I think.  Then after lunch is AP Lit and that class is gonna be hard I think.  And we only have 14 people.  It's really small.  But Shaina and Megan Stonestreet are in there and Jesse Fritz and Devin will keep it fun.  Then Physics I have with Kaitlyn.  And we had to do like work in that class.  And I was so tired.  I thought I was gonna fall asleep.  And yeah Mr. Nicolai gets so off topic.  He'll be talking about something and then think of this story that relates to it and tell us the story and it's like omg.  Could prove to be useful later though.  Then yeah after 6th hour, I go home.  Pretty handy dandy.  

I'm tired though so I think I'm going to go take a nap and then go to work.  I got my car back yesterday.  Yeah mom said it would be like $1,000 to fix it.  Or they could not fix it and wait for whatever the problem is to ruin the engine and that would be around $1,000 to fix or just put heavier oil in it and not drive very far so that's what we did.  Like my oil light comes on sometimes but then it goes off so it's working for now.  But yeah they're gonna look for a dif car for me because that one has so many problems.  But I got it back the other night, I'm happy.  :)  But I was up half the night just thinking about this being the last year of high school and everything and then I had to get up early and I have to work so I'm gonna be really tired tonight and I am already which is why I'm going to go take a nap.  Oh and this weekend me and Megan are gonna go see Mark if our moms say we can.  It'd be so fun though.  So hopefully that'll work out!!  But yeah.  Lots of Love!!"

I'm not a morning person.  Obviously.   And then mom came in like a few minutes later and was like whenever you get up and around we'll go get your class.  And I was like yeah whenever I get up and around.  I think you kinda helped that process along a little bit.  Since you kinda woke me up.  But whatever.

I won't have to drive out there and stuff at night and I can do it right from home and don't have to take off work for it or anything.  So yay!!

And I was up until 1 this morning taking a trip down memory lane with David Chapel.  Elementary school and all that good stuff.  We have the same ""bad habit"" and talking about Titanic and Really Good orange juice.  Haha it was fun.  And yes we're definately gonna have to go paintballing sometime!!

Then last night I went to see Red Eye with Amanda and that was so scary like the last 20 minutes.  I work myself up over movies so like at the beginning I'm like already scared and she kept grabbing me and I'd jump.  Then I was like all over her arm at the end.  I'm ""one of those ppl who scream during scary movies"".  But I only did once and there weren't that many ppl there.  It was an ok movie though except she helps the bad guy so he won't kill her and then saves the ppl the bad guy (with creepy but kinda sexy eyes just with a dif haircut) was going to kill and saves her dad and kills the bad guys.  And sorry if I just gave it away but I saved you an hour and a half and $8 and you would've figured it out anyways so I gave you the shortcut.  

I saw Rob and Tiffany's new baby last night too!  Cassidy Diane Matthews.  She was soo cute!!  And I saw the rest of the kids and they're cute too.  LoL  And they're going to Western this year instead of Jackson so that's cool.  She was so small though!!  

Yeah before that I was working.  It was just the usual.  We got pizza for lunch.  And I found a cricket but that whole story is in my AIM info so you can just read that.  And I killed a lot of flies.  And I tired to grab someone's balls.  Not really I was just putting money back in their pocket and he was like go a little deeper next time and then told everyone I tried to.  Yeah nothing majorly exciting though.   

I had to work Saturday night too.  Nicky, Vickie, and Chris left at 9 and RJ left like before 8 so it was me, Cory, and Josie from 9-10.  I was like omg everyone is leaving me!!  And then when they both came out of the office and punched out Cory was like don't give me that look like everyone's leaving you.  You still have me.  It was weird though only having one person there on Sat night.  And it was busy too!  I kept thinking it was Thursday night because I don't usually work Saturday nights.  Like not this whole summer.  And Cory's always manager Thursday night and Vickie always works Thursday night and I just kept thinking it was.  But it was Sat.  Yeah it confused me too.  

But yeah my weekend was basically working.  And tonight is like really the last night of summer.  Because tomorrow night I can't do anything because school is the next morning.  Duh.  So that's why I'm going to Tate's tonight and having a sleepover!!  Like little kids.  It'll be fun though.  Movies and...candy.  Yee haw!!

But yeah gotta go to band pretty soon here so I need to eat and stuff and gosh it's freaking COLD out.  Like pants and sweatshirt weather.  So yep I'm gonna go do all that.  Summer is almost over!!  Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Ok I feel a lot better today.  Yesterday was just very stressful.  Just another one of our infamous ""road trips"" lol.

Ok so I was gonna pick up Caitlin, pick up Megan, and hit up the bank in Parma and get on I-94 from Parma and be off.  But the bank in Parma was closed.  So I had to go to the bank in Spring Arbor.  And then I was just gonna get on the highway from Jackson, but I'd never actually done it before and didn't really know where I was going.  I was just following all the East I-94 signs.  Yeah almost got hit by a train...not cool.  LoL but pretty funny.  So anyways we're already like kinda late.  And we finally get on the highway.  And we're cruising along when my oil light starts blinking.  And then it's just staying on.  So I'm like ok what do I do.  So we're all calling our parents and stuff and they're like oh you're just low on oil.  Pull off at a gas station, get a quart of oil, put it in, and you'll be good to go.  And if you don't, it'll just burn up your engine.  GREAT...so we pull off and get some oil.  Then we don't know how to get the hood opened and when Megan finally does (you're awesome Meg Meg!) we don't know where the oil thing is at.  They said it'd say oil right on it, but it definately did not.  So this guy showed us where it was at and we were like oh OK.  So then I call dad because the oil thing had like steam coming out of it and we didn't know if we should put the oil in it.  So Caitlin hands me the oil and the lid is off but I didn't know that because I was trying to talk to dad so I like bend down to do something and get oil all over my sweatshirt.  Yeah that wasn't cool.  So finally some guy pored it in for us because it was all hot and stuff and then we checked the oil checker thing to see how much was in it and we were like IDK it looks good so we get in and the oil light goes off and we're on the road again, right?

WRONG!!  As soon as we're on the road again, it comes on again and stays on and I'm like omg wtf is wronog now.  But dad said if it was really low on oil it might need 2 quarts.  So we stop at this BP gas station and get another quart of oil and put it in because we're experts at it now.  So we're leaving waiting to turn out of the gas station and my light comes on again and I'm like ok this is really starting to piss me off.  We've put oil in it, there's enough in there so even if it was low, it should have plenty now.  So we go back to the parking lot and we're just kinda sitting around wondering what to do.  I don't wanna call dad beceause well I just don't.  So I call Ben and Cory and neither one of them answer their damn phones so we're like omg who else would know anything about cars.  So we decide to put some more oil in it and I go in to get the oil all by myself and the guy's like you have a very pretty smile.  Never stop smiling.  And I'm like OK... and then he's like Toronto Hard Rock, have you been there before because of my shirt and I'm like yep and then he's like well have a nice day and I'm like ok don't go in there alone again.  So we put more oil in it because we thought it could hold like 4 quarts or something.  So then there's this guy reading the paper and eating a banana in the car next to us and he finally gets out and helps us check how much oil is in it and by now there's TOO MUCH.  UGH.  So we're like ok well we know we have plenty of oil, let's try it out again.  I'm like I'm just gonna drive around the parking lot and see if the light comes on.  Well what do ya know, it definately did.

So I pull into a spot kinda off in the corner.  And we're like OMG what do we do.  Soo after sitting there a while, I'm like gimmie the owner's guide thingy.  And yeah it says the oil light indicates oil PRESSURE damn it, not if it's low.  And if the light comes on and stays on, it's not good and you need to pull off right away or it might like make your engine not good.  So we're like OMG we didn't even need oil to begin with.  But it said if there's low oil pressure it might be because there's not enough oil.  But yeah that wasn't the problem.  So I'm like omg what are we gonna do.  I can't drive it because it'll ruin my engine.  So I call mom and I just start crying and tell her what happened and we're between Jackson and Ann Arbor somewhere and didn't even make it to the college visit and we're stuck and I can't drive and she's like OK I'll call dad everything will be OK we'll get something figured out.  So then it was like dad kept calling and we were just hanging out listening to CDs and stuff while we were waiting and finally he's like OK I'm coming to get you guys and we'll just have to have it towed back to Jackson.  

So after a while this tow truck comes and we're like ok it beat dad here...and we start gathering up our stuff and yeah it was there to tow the truck that was right next to us.  Then we all start laughing because it's been a very long day and we can.  So dad finally finds out where we are.  I'm like it's exit 169, what more can I tell you.  I was getting very frustrated.  But yeah he gets there and we go to this place and then get a tow truck and move everything out my car into dad's and we're headed home.  Finally.  

So we get back, drop off the car at this repair place and mom comes and gets us and takes us home.  Being the super awesome mom she is, she doesn't make us go to band camp for the first part, even though it's only like 2:15.  So we get home and all run to a bathroom because we REALLY had to go and then we get some lunch and watch Remember the Titans and dance around and just chillax.  LoL I hate that word.  But that's what we did.  Then Ben was online and I was like I called you this morning and he was like yeah I was sleeping.  Oh that's nice.  The one time I really needed someone.  Then it was dinner time and mom made sloppy joes and stuff and had chips and cheese and pickles and watermelon and everything.  Then we all get around and Shaina takes us to band.  

Band was the same as always.  I was by Megan a lot of the time so we talked a lot.  Haha at least we didn't get in trouble like her and Caitlin did though.  That was pretty funny.  Not really in trouble Mr. B was just like some squad leaders need to be talking to their squads, not other leaders.  Caitlin and Megan, are your squads ok?  And they didn't even hear him.  I was like omg you guys.  Band just went by SO SLOW though.  Then finally it was time to go home.  And I was just like thank god.  It'd been a very very long and stressful day.

So I get home and I need to take my Hutch's Kid shirt back and as soon as I walk in Cory's like what'd you need today and I'm like OMG I've had the longest day ever and so I had to tell him everything and he found it very funny and Bryan came in and was listening and he thought it was pretty funny and I thought I was just gonna cry.  Cory was like yeah I was in bed, I kinda wasn't any help.  No shit you think.  You guys were all sleeping.  Then he was like yeah I guess we're not paintballing Saturday night anymore.  Cole can't now so that means nobody can I guess.  I was like yeah that's what they said about Saturday morning Cole was like well I have to work so we can't.  And I was like were you gonna play and he was like yeah I was gonna go play with you guys but now I have to work tomorrow night, Saturday night, and all day Sunday.  And I was like huh they didn't even tell me but yeah I have to work Saturday night anyways.  So my car better be fixed soon because I have to work Saturday and Sunday.  Those fuckers didn't even tell me they were gonna play though.  So I told Cory to keep me in the loop from now on.  I need to save my money for my own gun though.  Then I won't even have to borrow anyones.  So then I came home and just chilled and then went to bed.  So that was my exciting day.  

And Amanda - Red Eye comes out today so we need to go see it sometime but I'm working tomorrow night 4-10 and prolly Sunday 9-7.  And I don't know when I'll get my car back.  So yep just lettin ya know.  Let me know when works for you and we'll work something out.

Sorry this is so long!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hmmm band camp this week.  It's been ok I guess.  My squad does what they're supposed to do and everyone gets along.  Except we don't get along with squad #26 because squad 26 never knows where they're supposed to be or what they're doing :P  But yeah it hasn't been bad.  Except it's been a little hot and today we got a lecture about leaving ""campus"" for dinner, but whatever.

Tomorrow me and Tate and Meg Meg are going on a college visit to U of M and then hanging out afterwards and skipping band until after dinner.  Hahha.  Let's just say we're gonna have lots of fun.  :D

I called Nicole tonight since I haven't seen her in at least a few weeks.  Yeah she's leaving Saturday, heading off to college.  I was kinda like :'( afterwards.  She went down there for a week though and it sounds like she's gonna have a lot of fun and I think it'll be good for her.  But I'm still gonna miss her a ton.  She was like yeah I'll call you sometime and I'll be back on the weekends and then she was like bye chica.  Because that's what she always called me.  And then that's when I was like sniff sniff.  So yeah she better be coming back sometime soon.  LoL  Yeah and Shelly is gonna be working at Hutch's so that'll be cool since her and Nicole were like best friends so I'm sure she'll be just as cooky and Nicole was and she seems really nice so we'll prolly get along just fine.  It just seemed like summer lasted forever and it was like yeah the seniors are going to college and now it's actually happening and they're really leaving and stuff and it's just weird.  It just never seemed like it would actually happen.  And now I'm the senior.  Ahhhh!!  LoL it's cool but not.

But yeah that's what's been up with me.  Let's just say some people were looking pretty scrubby today that we saw *coughtatecough*  Hahah.  But yeah we're just mean like that.  And nobody gets that except for us.  ROAD TRIP TOMORROW!!  Ahhh it'll be fun!  LoL  Ok well I should prolly get off and go to bed since I have to wake up early...ugh.  Hope everyone enjoys their last days of summer.  Lots of Love!!"

I definately feel like a senior now.

Locker # 686.  Come visit me!  LoL

I got my dual enrollment...Foundations of Math and it's with Megan!  And the counselor changed my schedule around so I have 1st and 7th hours off.  How cool is that?  I get to sleep in and go home early.  Pretty awesome.  

Hung out with Caitlin and then we got our band uniforms and then hung out with Amanda and Caitlin and Jesse and Phil Dye and Rachael and her kids she's babysitting.  And now I'm home.  And I have to leave in less that 2 hours.  Phew!!

I guess I should be a good squad leader and do my stuff, but I think I'd be a funner leader if I was just kinda laid back and not like Shaina.  Haha.  She seriously was a bitch last year.  But I'm gonna be fun.  But I should at least try and know where I'm going.  So I might look over my stuff.  ugh.  LoL it's not that bad.  Yep see everyone later!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Well my last few days of summer have been really fun!  Summer kinda ends for me tomorrow with band and stuff so I had to make the last few days really count!  

Ummm Thursday night I worked and then I couldn't get to sleep that night and I know why but it's nothing I can help.  The same thing always happens but yeah I prolly sound really stupid right now because no one knows what I'm talking about except for me.  But yeah.  So then I had to wake up at 9:00 on Friday but I slept in until like 9:45.  I kept hitting my snooze.  So I got up and got around and went to the school to get my dual enrollment stuff and then I had to come home and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!  My room was so messy and I had to get it cleaned so I could go to Eric's.  I got it done though.  I just had to pick up my clothes off the floor which was like all of them and vacuum and yeah wasn't really that bad but it was so hot and that made it worse.  

So I had dinner at home and then went to work for a quick minute to talk to Ben and see if the schedule was up which it wasn't because of the meat sale.  Egh.  Thank God I didn't have to work.  So then I headed over to Eric's.  Yeah his parents were in Florida and rule #6 was No Girls in the House :) with the smiley and everything.  Yeah that rule was def broken.  :)  There were people there when I got there and people coming and going all night and it was fun.  Saryn and Liz were there and Suzie and Jory and Emily and this guy named Andy? and Wendy was there for like 2 seconds and Zak and Alicia and Amanda and Julia and Shane Miller and Caitlin and Eric and Rachael of course and I think that's it.  I'm sorry if I forgot anyone.  But yeah it was def fun.  Me and Caitlin and Suzie and Jory and Shane pulled an all nighter.  Didn't go to sleep at all.  We played Mario I think all night long and laughed and drank a NASTY energy drink.  But we had to have something to keep us going.  Lots of sex jokes.  Lots of eating.  Lots of drinking (just pop).  Yeah just lots of fun.  We need to do that again.  

Then at 7:20 I had to leave and go home so I could shower and get ready and meet Cole at the Concord High School parking lot.  And he was def like 1/2 an hour late but yeah then we went to Ben's who live way out in the middle of fucking nowhere and played some paintball!  Me and Cole got there and there was already this guy named Parker there (well that's his last name you know how guys are) and Ben was like this is Cindy we work with her, she's gonna be playing with us today and he kinda laughed and was like really?  Cool!  I was like oh you did not just laugh.  Then RJ came and this other guy named Chad I think with a long last name and I don't even know if that was his first name but we're gonna go with it.  It was so fun though!  I always got out like right away but that's not what's important.  The first game I didn't really know what I was doing and Cole nailed me right in the face mask.  Then we went back to the barn and the guys all played with their guns for like ever and then we went out and did another game and Ben freaking shot me right in the hand.  That hurt.  I was not wearing gloves or anything.  But it was from far away so it wasn't that bad but they said they heard me scream.  But I'm a girl so they'll just have to get used to it.  Because I am definately going again sometime.  Then we went back to the barn and played with the guns for a long more time and then went out and played another game and this time everyone on my team like got hit and was out, except for me.  Yeah the one who had no idea what she was doing.  So they finally hit me and I was out.  I was like I just wanna go out anyways.  But it was so fun!  Definately.  I wanna get my own pink paintball gun so I can fit right in and not have to use someone else's.  Cole has put $610 into his paintball gun.  A fricking paintball gun.  That's stupid.  But whatever.  It's pretty tight though.  And yeah we go out in the woods for our first game and there's a table so we're just all kinda talking and Parker goes off to do something and I turn around and he's peeing in the woods like right behind me.  I was likek whoa!!  At least warn me beforehand.  And then RJ's like yeah that's a good idea and he goes and does it.  It's like guys, c'mon.  I'm right here.   Then being the girl I am I had to change out of my paint covered dirty clothes into something cuter and cleaner and dryer.  Then today Cole was like yeah Parker said you had a nice body but he wanted to see more of it.  I was like ok...lol.  We might just have to give Parker what he wants.  Haha no he just wanted me to take off my hoodie jacket thing I had on.  Yeah I got there though and I bought a Mountain Dew on the way because I was seriously about to fall asleep just driving so I drank like the whole 20 oz even though I hate the stuff and I got there and I was like yeah just letting you all know I didn't sleep last nigiht and I'm tired and cranky and Cole was like don't even talk to me about no sleep and he starts going off on how he was trippin on RJ's ADHD medicine and thought he was gonna die.  Then today Ben was like Cole you were kinda bitchy yesterday morning and I was like yeah! and Ben was like so were you! and he was like you guys were just both bitching at eachother going at it.  Right in front of my dad's window.  He was like I'm surprised he didnt' come out and yell at you guys.  Haha I didn't think we were being that mean though.  It was so fun though and they were all like are you gonna play next time?  and then like well next time you can... and I'm like ok awesome.  I'm in.  Me and Aubrey def have to go together.  We would be so funny.  Give the guys a run for their money.  Yeah I'm just one of the guys though.  :)  I'm not complaining.  Guys are usually better friends than girls.

So on my way back to Spring Arbor/Parma I call work because Cory wanted me to help out and stuff at Kid's Day but I told him I was paintballing and stuff and he was like well then come by when you're done but we got done around 2 which was when it ended so I was like oh well I'll go anyways.  Ben and RJ said they were gonna have to help clean up anyways so I went and he was like you're a little late.  But me and him and Ryan did a lot of stuff.  I was there for 2 freaking hours outside doing actual work, still with no sleep.  Me and Ryan were boxing with the big gloves and I was laughing too hard to do anything so he was just beating me up.  It was so fun though.  Then he was throwing ice at me and shoving it down my shrit and pants and we were just having a fun time.  Then we had to help take down tents and stuff and that was hard!  Then we goofed around some more.  He like picked me up and laid me right down in all the ice and held me there.  Then Cory was making like all these sick but funny jokes.  He was like are your headlights on and I didn't know what that meant at the time (I do now though) and I was like looking at my car and I was like no I don't think so.  I didn't have them on all day.  And they're just laughing because they know I don't know what they're talking about but eventually I figure it out.  They're like turn them on for us.  Then we had to go get Cory's blazer parked waay out in the field and he had the seats down in the back and that's where I had to go and he's driving all crazy and he's like yeah you like it back there?  You've prolly been back there enough, have a lot of experience.  They were freaking turning everyhthing I said into something bad.  Like there weren't enough of those jokes on Friday night.  Haha.  It was fun though.  We were all walking out back and Cory was like we need to pick you up and put you head first into one of those puddles and I like looked at Ryan and he looked at me and I was like no and backed up and he was like I won't do anything while he's like grinning so he picked me up and I was like so close to it I seriously thought he was going to and Cory's like go ahead and I'm like NO! and put my hand down and he was like no don't do it.  I knew they wouldn't but I was scared there for a minute.  Guys are just fun though.  Just hanging out and being stupid.  Cory said we need to have a swimming party at my house and Ryan was like why not mine and he was like I didn't know you had a pool and I was like is it inground and he's like yeah and I was like ok I vote for Ryan's house.  He was like you guys can after work but I didn't.  I was way too tired.   I came home and fell asleep on the couch and then mom woke me up when TJ called and then I ate dinner and went to bed around 6:30, 7:00 and got up this morning at 7:30 and was seriously way tired still.  But I had to go to work.

So I worked 9-6:45ish because I had my band meeting to go to.  Yay for band geeks!!  Work was fun though.  Erik was being so mean, but so funny.  And I was tired and just laughing at everything being really goofy.  That's pretty much how I was all weekend.  It made it way easier to get through though.  So then I went to my band meeting and everything and yeah blah blah blah.  Nothing really new.  Wasn't really ""excited"" to see anyone beecause the people I would've been, I hung out with this summer.  It's like I wanted to see you and I did and it's cool I'm seeing you again.  And the rest of the ppl I just really didn't care about.  No offense.  Everyone was the same.  No one was dramatically different.  AMANDA - LOVE THE HAIR!!  It's sooo cute!!  Oh yeah we def made a pop run Friday night.  FUN FUN!  But yeah I'm in love with your hair.  Love the layers and everything.  

Yep I've been having fun and living it up these last few days.  Haha Ryan said I was like ""bad"" for staying at Eric's house when I told mom I was at ""Rachael's""  All the girls were at ""Rachael's""  LoL it was so funny.  I mean it's Eric.  He's not a bad kid or anything.  He's actually like really good.  And nothing happened at all bad.  But yeah I've had FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN!!  It's been pretty fucking awesome.  

And tomorrow is registration.  I'm getting there like at 7:30.  So I have to get up early and shower and stuff.  And go and wait and get a locker by all my friends and then band uniform fitting at 10 and then band at 2.  It feels like school mode is in full swing.  And I'm definately tired and need to go to sleep.  Sorry this is so freaking loooooooooong.  I'm just an interesting person though, what can I say?  LoL not really.  I love you all and I'll see you soon!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","My main goal today is to get my room cleaned.  So then I can go to Eric's party.  If mom will let me.  Basically I just had clothes all over my floor and most of them were dirty so I picked them up and now I need to vacuum and that's about it.  It looks pretty good though.  I think my goal is accomplished.  Or will be soon anyways.

So yeah prolly spending the night somewhere tonight.  Then I have to get up early tomorrow to go paintballing.  Then Cory wanted me to ""volunteer"" at the Kid's Day tomorrow but I have no clue doing what.  He said just stop by when I was done playing.  It'd be community service though so I'll prolly go from Ben's to work and then home around 2 or later.  I think it'll be pretty cool though.  Jaymi is gonna be the leprechaun the kids get to eat breakfast with and Josie is gonna be in a costume.  That's kinda what they wanted me to do but no.  LoL if I wasn't doing anything then I would.  But I have plans.  So maybe I'll just like help if they need anything and tear down stuff or something.  Everyone stop by with some kids though!

Yeah I was just eating lunch and needed something to do so that's why I updated but now I'm done with my lunch so I think I'm gonna go back to cleaning my room.  I hope it's this breezy next week for band camp.  Nice and cool and breezy.  But it'll prolly be fricking hot.  Ok I'm off to finish stuff.  Lots of Love!!"

Love is knowing someone inside and out and never getting bored, never wanting more, always being content with who they are no matter how many things you ""don't like"" about them.  Love is putting someone's faults aside because everyone has them. It's wanting their happiness more than anything you've ever wanted for yourself.  Love is patient, it's caring, it's unconditional, and it is FOREVER. Love is missing the fights because every moment with them, even the fights, are cherished. Love is knowing you can be with one person forever and never want to be with anyone else ever.  Never wanting to hold or kiss another person because the person you're with is so perfect that even the imperfections become perfect.

It's just so cute and true.

OK let's talk about last night!

Chelsea picked me up around 5 and we went to Jereamy's house for a cookout.  There was me, Chelsea Herlein, Melissa Spice, Abby Buter, Katie Clark, Becca Matthews, Sara Nees, Jereamy Slager, Danny Nelson, Abe Janson, Bobby Ganton, and Jake Sinkovitz.  We fit all 12 of us into 2 cars!  It was insane.  So we were all very crowded but Danny's dad had saved us two spots at his work right across from the fair and we didn't have to pay or anything.  So then we all walked around the fair and lost half our group and saw tons of people we know and then finally went and sat down.  Then we saw tons more people we know and we were in the THIRD ROW!!  We were seriously so close.  It was awesome.  The opening act was Sleeping At Last and they played for a while and then set up more stuff and then Switchfoot played!  It was so cool.  He totally pointed at Becca and afterwards they were all like ahhh he did and the boys were like no he didn't.  There were so many ppl taking pictures even though you weren't ""allowed"" to.  It was fun though.  We finally got out around 10:30 and then we all went to Steak N Shake and there were a ton of ppl that went there after the concert.  I saw Allie Kramer and she was talking to Danny and then she was like Cindy!  How are you?  What are you doing?  I was like wow she remembers me.  Then we all went back to Jereamy's and went home from there.  It was so much fun though!!!!!  Awesome.

So this morning I woke up around 8:30 because my mosquito bites were very itchy.  Like they start halfway between my knee and ankle because I had capris on and then they're all there and down my feet and I have like 35-40 on each foot and that little bit of leg that was showing.  That's just insane.  Mosquitos ALWAYS bite me though.  And it's not a good thing.  So I couldn't sleep because of that so I got up and put some stuff on and came down here for a minute and then went back up and slept until noon.  When Shaina gets out of the shower I'm gonna shower and then go to the school and do my dual enrollment stuff but I need to talk to Megan because I wanna know what class she's taking and stuff.  And then I have to go to work.  

Last night was really fun though!!  LoL   Lots of Love!!"

"event","So yesterday was really fun!!

Got up and got around and Tate picked up me and Amna.  We got lost like 5 different times on the way there and finally were like ok we're just gonna follow signs that say GVSU this way.  We stopped at a lot of gas stations too and really someone in Lansing didn't know how to get to Jackson.  That was like umm ok.  So anyways we got there and it was really pretty and quite more of a laid back campus.  It was really cool though.  I liked it.  Then we went in to Grand Rapids and were looking for the mall and we're just driving through the city and there's so much construction and Tate is freaking out because she doesn't know where she's going.  It was kinda funny.  So we finally stopped at a gas station and this guy was like what mall and we're like um any one really.  So he was like ok go down this street until you get to 28th and turn left and it'll be on 28th.  So we're going down this street looking for 28th and we're like driving through the ghetto part of town and we're like freaking out and Amna was like hold on to your purses at stoplights.  So we didn't think we'd ever find it and I was about to call and see if Stephanie was at work because she goes to GVSU and I'm sure she's gone in to Grand Rapids to the mall before.  But FINALLY we found it.  Then we went to T.G.I.Friday's for lunch/dinner and our cute waiter told us how to get back on the highway and that was another trip.  LoL it was just a fun day overall.  We were all yelling at each other about which way to go and yeah one of Tate's CDs flew right out the window.  We couldn't stop laughing about that.  We stopped and got some ice cream and Amna's was melting all over the car so we stopped at a gas station to get some paper towels for her and that was really funny.  It was just fun.  Hhaha our road trips ROCK!!

Then Shaina called me on the way home and said Chelsea invited us over to go swimming so as soon as I got home we left again.  That was really fun too.  Kaitlyn McCarrell and Megan Bartlett and Megan Stonestreet and Chelsea were there and then me and Shaina and then Aaron Skeene came and then Nate Holton and this other kid that I keep forgetting his name.  All I know is his last name is Benson and then Mike Aikens came and then Josh Lane.  So we all hung out and were swimming and then there was a bonfire and s'mores and lots of talking.  It was cool though to see ppl I haven't seen all summer.  Then at the end it was just me and Shaina and Megan and Chelsea left so we had boy talk and girl talk and then at midnight we all left.  The boys all left at one point to go see Josh's new truck and we T.P.'d Nate's car.  Hahah it was great.  Then he was like ok I gotta leave and someone else was and I'm like c'mon Chels let's walk them to their cars and she was like oh OK!  He was like no what'd you do.  Then he backed right into Josh's new truck and he about had a heart attack.  It was really fun though.

Now today I have to get around and get ready and then Chelsea is picking me up before 5 and we're going to Jereamy's for a cookout and then we're all going to the Switchfoot concert.  There's like 12 or 15 ppl going alltogether so that should be fun.  I have to go get something to bring though.  So I should go get showered.  And yeah I guess there's a squad leader meeting on Sunday night?  So yep I'll be seeing some ppl on Sunday and some on Monday and the rest in about a week.  Have fun the rest of the summer while you can!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hey Hey quicky update to let you know what's going on in my life.

Thursday was the beach.

Friday was hanging out and then watching Hunter at night.  I took him to McDonalds and then to work to get my schedule and some cards for mommy and daddy and he met Josie and RJ and Cory.  He asked how long me and Josie had been friends and just kinda wandered around while I talked to RJ and he had a little convo with Cory.  He loves his truck because it has big wheels.  And it is a hot truck.  Cory was like how do you put up with her and he kinda laughed and was like I annoy her.  He was like yeah pain in the ass.  I mean hello he's only 7 here he doesn't need to be learning words like that yet.  Then Hunter was like yeah I have another sister...it's like girl heaven.  He was kinda funny.  Then I let him have 2 quarters to get a bouncy ball.  Then we went to Frosty Boy and I let him play mini golf.  Then we went to the park in Parma and then to the Parma Party Store to get a water because he was thirsty and then back to the park and then finally home.  He told mom he had a lot of fun though and I'm an awesome sister.  :)

Saturday I was supposed to work at 8.  I set my alarm clock for 6:40 but it was too early so I turned it off and went back to sleep and mom came in to my room and was like are you working today and I was like yeah and she was like what time and I was like 8 and I'm kinda noticing it's pretty light out and I'm like what time is it and she's like um 8:06.  I was like holy shit mom I have to go to work.  So she went and called and said I'd be a little late and I didn't even shower or nothing.  I just threw my hair up and ate really quick and left.  Rick was just like good morning.  But at least I got to sleep in a little.  And they didn't say anything really so it was cool.  LoL I like working someplace so flexible.  Then I came home and took a nap and then woke up for dinner and Amanda called me and said Allie was having a little party so ppl could meet her foreign exchange student and Manda was like yeah mine'll be there too.  So yeah went and hung out with Allie Savoy and Laurie from France and Amanda Andrews and Julia from Germany and Marc WITH A C Haugen and Jesse Fritz and David Chapel.  It was fun though and we fit 6 ppl on the couch.  The exchange students seem really nice though and they'll prolly open up more as they get more comfortable.  It was just fun hanging out with some ppl and watching Tommy Boy.  American classic.  

Then today I had to work from 9-3 and then came home and watched America's Next Top Model for like 4 hours so I could see who won season 3.  Then I pretty much did nothing.  And tomorrow I have to get up at like 8 because Tate's picking me up at 9 and we're going on a college visit to Grand Valley!!  And then maybe some shopping.  And then maybe back home.  It'll be fun though.  Watch out, here we come!!

I think I'm going to go to bed so I'll see you all when school starts!!  I'll prolly be seeing ppl next week for band stuff and registration.  So yep!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Dang I had a freaking blast yesterday!!

So Wednesday I was talking to Rachael and her birthday was on Monday and she was like yeah a bunch of us are going to Lake Michigan so wanna go and I was like ehhh I don't know if mom will let me because me and Tate wanted to go and she was like I'm not sure I want you to so I was like I'll ask her and since more ppl are going she just might let me.  

So mom got home and I was like mom Rachael called me today and her birthday was Monday and she's having a b-day party and invited me and so can I go and she was like ummmm and I was like it's at Warren Dunes and she went there a few weeks ago so she knows where she's going and she has a reliable mini-van that won't break down like my car might and Eric and Suzie and Jory are going and they're 18 so they're ""adults"" and then Rachael and me and Tate so she was kinda leading towards yes and she was like you'll have to ask your dad and so I was like dad I'm going to Rachael's birthday party and he was like ok...and mom just had to tell him the details and he was like oh ok have fun and I was like yes!  

So I got up around 7:30 so I could get ready and around and go to work and get my check and go to the bank and then to Tate's house and then we went to Rachael's.  When we got to Rachael's she was like crying and she was like mom says I can't go and we were like WHAT!?  Her mom said that the weather was bad and being on the beach we might get struck by lightning and she didn't want Rachael driving in the rain and everything like that so we were like oh no we have to go.  Then Suzie came over so she was calling everyone and we were gonna stop in Kalamazoo to pick up another one of her friends so she finally convinced her mom to let us go to Kalamazoo and her mom was like if you get there and Saryn's mom says that the skies are really clear and it's ok then you can go to the lake so we were like alright!  So finally like 10:40 we head out and pick up Eric and Jory and we're on our way!

We get to Kalamazoo and her mom says yeah we can go because it's really fun and stuff so Saryn had a friends with her so they were gonna follow us because we only had room in Rach's van for one more person.  So they went to their dad's work and her mom took their dad's car and they took the van so then we went to Taco Bell for lunch and we're all done eating lunch getting ready to go to the lake and Rachael's ""reliable mini-van"" wouldn't start.  so she was like this has happened before just wait a few minutes and it will.  So we're like ok waiting and yeah it's def not startinig so we're like ok what do we do.  So Saryn was there with her van and we were gonna try and use jumper cables to start it but no one had any so they went to go look for some at their house and couldn't find any so Rachael was calling her brother and asking what to do because he'd worked on it before and stuff and he was like well I'll drive up so I'll be there in about an hour.  So we were just all hanging out and waiting for him and we were like is he gonna take us home or fix your van so we can still go to the lake.  I mean we didn't go all that way just to go back home and not go to the lake so she was like no he'll fix it.  So it's about the time that he's gonna get there and like two different ppl come over and are like having car trouble?  Yeah that would've been nice an HOUR AGO!  So then those two ppl are looking at it and her brother gets there so we have 3 ppl all looking at it and he bought a new starter for it and they put it in and it worked!!  But he said that we were gonna take his CAR to the lake and he was gonna take her van back home.  Just in case it didn't work all that well.  So it's a little Cadillac and we have to fit 6 ppl in it.  But on the way to the lake some ppl went in Saryn's van and me and Rachael and Tate rode in her brother's car.  

So we finally made it to the lake at 4:00!!  Only 4 hours later than planned.  So me and Tate and Rachael are just pulling our clothes off and running into the lake.  And the rest of the ppl are just setting up on the beach and laying out their blankets so we get out and are like get your asses in the lake.  We did not go through all that trouble so you could sit on the beach and do nothing.  So everyone went in.  It was kinda cold but not like super cold.  It felt good and you got used to it.  So after awhile of swimming we decided to climb up the sand dune.  That was a mistake.  That thing was freaking big and steep and it was hard to do.  But finally most of us made it to the top.  On the other side it just went down to like a forest so me and Eric and Jory slid down the other side and just kinda laid there for a little bit and then had to climb back up.  It was so fun though!!  We were like I think I'm gonna die.  This isn't a bad place to die though.  It's very pretty.  But then we kinda walked around at the top and then ran down.  Then we crashed about halfway down and just laid there talking for a while.  Then Tate came and found us.  And then we ran the rest of the way down and went swimming again.  

Then Saryn and her friend had to go so everyone had to get the stuff out of her van and put it in the little car.  Then we were swimming and Rachael said it was time to go.  We didn't wanna go but it was getting kinda late and it was still like a 2 hour drive home.  So we were like what should we do with all the chips we have left?  I was like maybe the birds want them so there was like this huge cluster of birds just hanging out so me and Tate got a handful of chips and threw it at them and they like all flew right to them and we were like screaming and running away.  It was so cool though!  So then Eric is like throwing them at Tate and she's running and screaming because all the birds are flying at her and I set my stuff down and then he threw them where I was and I was running away but I kinda left my stuff there and the seagulls were surrounding it.  So then I ran towards them screaming and they kinda hopped away from my stuff.  Then we started walking towards the car where Rachael and Suzie already were.  Eric fed the rest of the chips to the birds and we didn't really wanna get in the car all wet so we were kinda trying to dry off a little and get our clothes on because we were gonna stop somewhere to eat on the way home.  We had to have 3 ppl in the front seat and 3 in the back seat.  It was a little crowded.  We went back to Kalamazoo to this Wild Wings place and it said Bar and Grill and we were like ok and I was like it's prolly like Applebees because that has a little bar place.  And there were tons of cars in the parking lot so we were just gonna ask how long of a wait it would be.  So the ppl were looking kinda confused and they were like it's seat yourself but we need to see some ID and we were like oh uh.  But they let us go and order our food and then we ate on the way home.  It was one awesome day though!!!   We were like we so have to go back!

Then we had to stop at Rachael's brother's house and get her van and give him his car and then she dropped me and Tate and Suzie off at Jory's and took Eric home and then went back to her brother's.  So then Jory took me and Tate back to Rachael's because that's where my car was and I took Tate home and then went home and went to sleep.  Climbing sand dunes is freaking hard work!!  Oh and me and Tate got buried in the sand and we made a kinda sand castle.  It had a lot of problems with it but the moat was pretty cool.  Yep it was a fun fun day though!

Tonight mom and dad are going out to dinner for their anniversary and stuff so I have to watch Hunter.  We're gonna go to McDonalds and maybe Frosty Boy and just hang out and swim maybe.  Just chill.  It shouldn't be that bad I hope.  Maybe I'll take him to the park.  Then he'd think I was the coolest sister in the world, which I am.  But yeah I think I need to go shower and stuff so I don't smell like lake.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Dang our power went out last night for a long time!  I got home from work and sat down to look at the paper and went upstairs to show Shaina something and the lights like flickered and came back on and then they went out for good.  So we were all trying to find our way around in the dark.  Not cool.  But it's back on now.  It was weird though because it wasn't even raining or anything.  

This morning dad told me to go drop off my car so they could fix it so I did.  I just want my stinking radio to work ok?  Apparently that's too hard for them to do.  

So I was making dinner the other day and cutting up some potatoes and it was wet and slippery from washing it and the knife slipped and yeah I cut my finger.  Just as my other one is better.  It kinda just cut into my skin and not straight down which is good because that would've been bad.  But yeah it hurts.  But I think I'll live.  

And since I had to get up early today, I'm going to lay out all day.  I don't have to go to work or anything.  So yep that's what I'm gonna go do.  Have a great day!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Wow it's oficially August.  Band starts in two weeks and school in three and a half.  That does not seem possible.  We were talking at work the other day about school and how when August comes around you just start dreading going back and it sucks.  I remember being a freshman and the seniors were like so scary to me and now that is me.  And I still see those people a lot at work and now it's like they seem so old.  And in a few years that will be me.  Life just goes by so fast so you have to make the most of it while you can.  Which is why my final year in high school is gonna rock!!

Today is Rachael's birthday, Brent's birthday, and mom and dad's anniversary.  Wow!  I was talking to mom the other day and she said that dad asked her out like the beginning of November and he proposed on Thanksgiving.  Yeah they dated for like a few WEEKS!  And then they got married in August.  That was moving along really fast.  But they'd both been married before and knew what they wanted.  And they've been married 13 years so something went right there.  It's just kidna weird though.  

Today I have to go to the dentist.  And then right to work from there.  I think I'll run for a little bit and then take a shower and then get ready to go.  With Strength and Conditioning, I definately need to start running.  And I saw Mr. Meredith the other day at work.  Yep he looks just as tough as ever.  That class is gonna BLOW.  But I'll get through it and be stronger in the end haha literally.  ok enough jokes for me.  

I really am excited about band camp.  I talked to David Chapel the other night and we're gonna make it fun!  LoL not really but I'm still excited!  Everyone at work was making stupid jokes about band camp and laughing because I'm excited about it.  But what can I say.  

Tonight I'm gonna ask mom if I see her about going to the beach on Thursday.  Or if not then maybe next week sometime.  That would be so fun though!  Laying out all day getting a very nice tan.  Just in time for back to school.  Yep I'm gonna maybe tan a little bit today if I have time. I have to do some chore stuff first and then get ready around 1 so that's not a lot of time.  But maybe it's enough to get a little color.  Well everyone enjoy their last few weeks of summer and I'll be seeing you all in a few weeks!  Lots of Love!!"

Seriously I'd go out and spend all my money but I need some for the rest of the week.  I think I'm going bowling with Sara tomorrow.  That should be fun.  I have to ask mom though but she should let me.  

Yeah this morning I went to work, got my check, signed it, went and cashed it and was all the way to the mall and then I was looking at the little slip thing that said how much per hour I make and I was like whoa this is not mine.  Yeah it was Stephanie Hammond's and the bank let me cash it and everything.  So I called work and Johncie was like go back to the bank and give them the money and ask for the check back so they did and then I took that back to her to do whatever with and then got mine and went back to the bank and cashed it and then finally went shopping.  If she would've given me the right check in the first place none of this would've happened.  But I didn't look at it or anything either.  And I can't believe the bank let me cash it because it said Stephanie Hammond on the front and I signed it Cynthia Rees and had my account number and everything so I don't know.  It was weird though.  Tate was like call Hutch's and ask what to do.  I don't know what I'd do without her.  LoL.  I have to go to work though so I'll talk to you all later.  Lots of Love!!"

I went to Tate's today.  LIke always.  First we went to Burger King and then to her house to watch Guess Who? and that was really good.  It was so cute and me n Tate were like awwww like we always do when we watch movies.  

Tomorrow we are going shopping and then I'm going to work.  I need new shoes and pants.  I need some red shoes to go with our new work shirts.  They say I AM A Hutch's KID.  We're having a kid's day festival on August 13th I think so that's like ""promotion"" for it.  At least it's like dress down.  I so wanna keep my shirt though so I'm gonna see if I can.  But yeah I was wearing white pants and the shirt was white and it just didn't really match.  So I need some like dark khakis.  Or black.  Just something that's not white.  And I just feel like going out tomorrow.  So yep that's the plan.

Work Monday night was fun.  That's all I'm saying though.  

Tonight me and Shaina went ""exploring"".  We like went out back in like the weeds and everything we have and went over the barbed wire fence and then into some corn fields and then walked along those for a while until we got to some woods and walked through those until we saw this field and some dirt bikers and then we were like running out of there so they wouldn't see us or nothing.  Then I was freaking sweaty and I'm sure I got eaten by mosquitos.  We're going back again sometime though when it's cool like this.  Def can't do it when it's hot.  It was fun though!!  And I think I'm going to go eat some ice cream now.  Lots of Love!!"

I was gonna lay out and tan all day today but it's not even sunny so I don't think that's gonna be happening.  Yeah everyone at work yesterday was like what the fuck did you back into.  But I checked my lights and they work.  The one is just white instead of red but it still blinks for when I turn and it works when I push on my breaks.  So I shouldn't get pulled over for it.  But yeah I was like nothing I think someone hit me and they were like uh huh.  I should prolly get it fixed sometime though.  My finger is doing ok.  It kinda hurts but I think it's getting better.  Then yesterday at work I kinda cut one of my other fingers but it was like just the skin.  But that one hurts more than my other one.  And I scraped my hand on something.  I'm just getting all kinds of beat up.  I think I'm gonna go make myself some breakfast.  Nothing really sounds good though.  Maybe I'll make some hashbrowns and toast and bacon.  Do a little gourmet thing if that's even how you spell it.  Sorry there's nothing exciting to talk about.  Maybe next time.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hey Hey I've had an exciting few couple of days.  

Wednesday I went to Caitlin's!!  Because we're chicas.  We hung out and tanned and went swimming and rescued frogs!!  And I got really burned but now it's just a tan.  So that was fun hanging out and tanning.  We're such girls.  

Then Thursday was MSU!!  ROAD TRIP!  We were kinda getting lost on campus and trying to fing where we were supposed to go and then we had to walk for forever to the building.  OMG dorms are so small!!  Seriously like my room is twice as big as they are and I don't have to share my room or use a community bathroom with everyone else.  I'm gonna have a lot of adjusting to do.  It was so cool though.  I can't wait to be out on my own.  We kinds skipped out early and went to Cheddars because we were starving.  Caitlin was like a little camel and had like three glasses of pop.  Dang girl!  It was so good though and we were being so stupid.  It was fun though.  Then we went shopping afterwards.  I got a shirt and a hoodie from Old Navy and a shirt and pair of pants from Deb and a purse and a wallet from Satchel.  Me and Caitlin got the same purse but mine is black and hers is white.  And my wallet is hot pink.  Oh yeah it's awesome.  Then we went to DQ when we were done shopping and then we went home.  It was raining and we got stuck behind this person that was going 45 in the construction zone, even though no one was there working.  They were freaking holding up like everyone.  It was frustrating.  Then we just hung out at Amna's until midnight and then me and Tate were going homem and we were lost and there was this Road Closed sign and we almost went down that road a no outlet one and it's scary when it's dark and raining and your radio doesn't work!!  It's so quiet and spooky.  But we all got home ok.  And it was a fun fun day.

Friday I just kinda hung out and did nothing.  I went to get my work schedule but it wasn't up yet so I went home and went back later and it still wasn't up.  So I hung out there for like 2 hours while I waited for John to make it up.  But I talked to Ryan and RJ and Cory.  OMG I wanna go paintballing sometime.  They all do it like Saturday morning but I always have to work Saturday mornings.  So I'll have to talk to Ben about that.  I think it'd be so fun though.  Even though they would seriously all shoot at me.  Before summer is over though and school starts back up, that's what I wanna do.  

Then today I had to work 8-4.  Like always.  I seriously cut my finger open on a boxcutter.  I thought I was going to die.  I don't like blood at all.  I'd kinda been cutting myself all morning but they didn't bleed or anything so when I did that time I looked down and it was like running down my finger so I went to the back room and Brock was there and I was freaking out and it was dripping all over by then and he didn't know what to do so I got some paper towel and was just holding it and it wouldn't stop bleeding so I went to the break room to look for John and Cory and Bob were back there and Donna our deli lady.  So Cory was just like keep the pressure on it to make it stop bleeding since he like took a paramedic course and all so he knew what he was talking about.  Then Bob wanted to put that stuff on it that bubbles and I was like get away!!  It was very traumatic though.  Cory put a band-aid on and it bled through so we had to get the super duty kind and he put two on and said if it went through that then I'd need stitches but it's ok now.  And he checked the blade to make sure it wans't rusty or anything.  It's my little pinky finger too.  Mom looked at it when I got home and she said it's ok.  Nothing too serious.  I just have to keep the band-aid on to let it all heal up.  That was my exciting day at work though!!  And then me and Brock were cleaning windows and he fell off this huge stack of like water softner salt and charcoal and scraped his arm on the brick wall and so he was bleeding and it was just kind dangerous at work today.  

And this morning on my way out the door dad was like what'd you back into and I was like what?  I didn't know what he was talking about.  I was like nothing and he was like well then you'll prolly get stopped for having a busted out taillight.  I was like ok...and just went to work.  So when I got there I looked at it and it's like the glass is like totally broken and I have this huge dent like someone backed into my car and I was like mad.  I totally did not do it and someone just ran into it and left.  It must've just happened the other day though.  And dad still thinks I was the one who did it but mom believes me.  I'm not happy about that though.

Then I come home today and tell mom about my car and my finger and I'm looking at the pool and I was like who's the weird kid.  Yeah Hunter totally has a friend over and he's spending the night.  Talk about torture. Two little seven year olds running around and being loud.  My idea of a fun night.  Not.  And I have to get up and work tomorrow morning.  And if someone else calls in I'm gonna seriously have to scream.  I think I need to go watch tv or swim or something.  Wait for my finger to get better.  I know I'm a baby, but I seriously don't like cutting myself and blood and it just all freaks me out.  I don't like being hurt at all.  So I need to go take care of it so it'll get better.  I think the band-aid is a little too tight and it's cutting off the circulation to it.  It feels weird.  It's prolly gonna fall off or something.  I need to go think of something else though and stop typing and using it.  So I will let you all know when it's better.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","I had a nice talk with Caitlin this afternoon.  I just called for one little thing and we got to talking about everything.  I have to go sign up for my JCC class sometime soon.  First I have to figure out which class I want to take and then go to the school and get the form and then go to JCC and get it all filled out and signed up and get my book and everything.  I'm so excited though!!

I know it sounds crazy, but I'm excited for school to start!  I'm gonna be a senior and taking a college class and I think it will just go by so fast.  And the closer college gets, the more excited I'm getting.  I just can't wait to be out on my own and doing my own thing.  I mean I'm going to miss home and the people here and like work and stuff, but I'm gonna be meeting new people and probably getting another job and being on my own with no parents!!  I think I wanna go to U of M if I can.  It's in Ann Arbor so there's like good shopping and plenty of job oppurtunities and it's a good school and only like 45 minutes from home.  So if something ever happens that I just need to get home, it's not even a long drive.  But maybe after my college visits I'll find something I like better.  But really I'm not gonna be that far away, but far enough that mom and dad won't be able to tell me what to do.  

Speaking of mom and dad being far away...they're going to Las Vegas in October.  They're leaving on the 5th and coming home on the 8th.  So woo hoo there's gonna be a party happening somewhere.  Not here though because grandma will be here to watch Hunter.  Because I definately am not doing that.  But I know someone who's turning 21 while they're gone so...
We'll just see what happens.

Caitlin we'll definately stay friends after high school.  Can you say party at my dorm?  LoL and I will definately call you about all the new college guys I meet and all that jazz.  So I'll be calling you a lot.  I think I'll need a good phone plan.  I mean we've already hung out so much this summer and talk all the time.  And Megan definately too.  We'll all be chicas for life.  I love you girlies!!

I can't wait for band either!!  My squad will be freaking awesome and we're gonna kick ass and have fun doing it!  And look good too.  Can't forget that.  Especially in our spankin new marching uniforms.  Oh yeah.  And we get like a freaking 1 1/2 hour lunch break.  I'm definately thinking Taco Bell some night and shopping.  It'll just be fun.  

My plans for tomorrow include:  Going shopping for a raft for the pool and then laying out all day and getting nice and dark.  And then I have to take Hunter to his swimming lesson at 3:30 and that's about it.  Then Thursday is MSU and shopping!  So tomorrow will be a lazy day.  

Aubrey is gone for a few days visiting her man.  And Ryan wasn't back last night like he was supposed to be.  Maybe I'll go call some people.  I've been so bored today and I just feel like talking.  And we got a new computer and I think dad wants to hook it up and stuff.  So I'll update later.  I'm excited for college though!!  I think that was the main point of this entry.  Oh well.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Ok so the weekend was not all that exciting.  

Friday I went over to Tate's house and that was fun!  We just kinda hung out and listened to music for a little bit and then went to Frosty Boy and then back to her house and then to Amanda's and then to Caitlin T.'s to get her and then to McDonalds and then back to Tate's house and then back to Caitlin's to drop her off and then back to Tate's and then I went home.  We just all talked though and it was nice.  Except for all the mosquito bites I got!  Holy crap my hands and feet have tons on them since I was wearing a sweatshirt and jeans, that was the only skin I had showing.  They really itch though.  And the one right in the middle of my hand made my hand get all puffy and stuff so my hand looks extra fat.  I so told Caitlin we should go inside but she didn't listen to me.  And now we're all itchy.

Anyways...I got home at 1:30 and then had to get up at 6:30 for work.  So yeah I wasn't in the best of moods.  But we didn't do anything.  Everything got faced Friday night so we touched it up and then just kinda goofed around.  I spent a lot of time out back just sitting on a bench watching it rain.  Until it thundered really loud then I was like ok I'm going inside.  And it wouldn't stop raining!!  It did like all day and the balloons didn't get to go up or anything.  Then John came in to work at 2 and actually made us do some real work.  That sucked because it was like stupid stuff.  So me and R.J. and Brock were hiding in the dairy cooler.  I was glad to go home though.  I really really wanted to call Caitin and talk to her but she was at work so I called Megan because I just HAD to talk to someone.  Then after I talked to her I fell asleep for a little bit and then woke up and watched a little bit of tv and then went to bed.  That was a fun and exciting day.  Not.  I was really tired though.  

So I had to wake up this morning to go to work.  With John.  I was not looking forward to it, but it actually wasn't that bad.  I pretty much stayed on register all day but it was better than having to face or do other stupid crap.  Cole was up there too so we just talked and cleaned out drawers.  Haha it was funny.  Then I talked to Aubrey on my lunch break and the break room smelled like paint.  Because they were painting it.  So that was gross.  Then I had to stay until 5 instead of 3 because Nicky called in again.  She did that last week too and it's like annoying.  And today I actually wanted to go home because like everyone was there for Shaina's party.  Oh yeah Happy Birthday Shaina!!  And there was like cake and ice cream that I wanted to eat.  So I was a little annoyed.  But now I'm home.  And I fell asleep again.  And now I'm just bored because there's nothing to do.  Maybe I'll go out and go swimming or something.  I don't know.  But I have to work again tomorrow night.  Tomorrow night should actually be kinda fun.  Ryan will be back from Florida and I'm sure he'll tell me about all the hot chicks he saw.  And I'll just be putting up candy and maybe I'll convinve Bob to let me stay until 10 since I had to get someone to work for me Thursday.  Even though I asked for it off they still scheduled me and I was like sorry I'm not coming in because I asked for it off.  I mean hello I'm gonna be out of town.  So I worked an extra 2 hours today and then an extra 2 tomorrow and that will cover the 4 I'm not working.  Yep I'm smart like that.  And if mom doesn't leave us a huge list of crap to do, I'm going to lay out most of the day and get even tanner.  Just a lazy relaxed day.  

I can't wait for Thursday!!  I haven't seen Amna all summer and it'll be fun just us girls hanging out.  Ok well I'll talk to you guys later!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hey Hey how's everyone!!  

I just had an awesome few hours with Caitlin!!  I haven't hung out with her in forever so we got to talk talk talk.  And it was super nice.  And I love you Tate!!  We were just watching Real World and being mean and it was fun.

And I got my car back!!  It was the alternator I think.  And I think they forgot to reconnect the radio because it definately doesn't work.  And it sucks so much.  So dad said to go back tomorrow and tell them and I was like are you crazy!!  I'm not doing that.  I'll just have someone at work see if they can fix it.  It totally wouldn't start the other night though when dad went to go get it.  He like jumped it with Shaina's car and as soon as he took off one of the cables it would just stop.  So we had to have it towed which was $50 and it was over $400 to get it fixed.  But mom and dad paid for it so it doesn't really concern me.  And it's not like I was doing anything to make it break, so it's not my fault it did.  At least it's fixed though and they vacuumed it and everything!!  It looks spanking awesome now!

Ok so hopefully I'm gonna be going to Caitlin's house on Friday night.  We're just gonna hang out and I'm gonna spend the night and get up and go to work.  Mom was in a mood today so hopefully she'll let me.  I hope so!  It would be so much fun!!  ;)

I got my senior pic previews today!!  I'm like so excited and I already know which ones I want and stuff.  But I'm gonna be showing everyone!!  He said to get lots of opinions and stuff about what people like and stuff and go from that.  So tomorrow I'm gonna get my check and I'll take my pics and show everyone and then I'm working from 4-8 so I'll show all the night people and that way everyone can see them.  Some of them are really bad though and there are like some weird poses and in some of them I'm squinting and stuff.  But there's a few really good ones I think and so those are the ones we'll get.  I was so excited though!!

Not much else going on.  Megan's spending the night.  Her and Shaina are watching a movie right now though and I already missed half of it because me n Tate were watching Real World and talking.  So I'm just updating.  Haha someone at work said all I do is flirt all day.  I don't think so.  I just talk ya know and have some fun when I can.  But whatever, if that's what I am, that's what I am.  I can't change it.  I'll just have to be more careful. 

I miss Tate already!!  I'm kinda tired so I think I'll just go to sleep and wake up bright and early tomorrow and go get my check and cash it and get some gas and yup.  Then come home and lay out and tan and then go to work and then come home and I don't know.  I think I need some ice cream though.  Mint chocolate chip.  Yum Yum!!  Talk to everyone later!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Ok I'm having more car troubles.  And it really sucks!!  So the other day I was at Subway getting my dinner and talking to Aubrey so I'm getting ready to go back to work and my car would not start!!  It like made this weird like click click click and like my speed thing was going like all over the place but it wouldn't start.  So I was like omg Aubrey so she like jumper cabled it for me and it started and she was like let it run and it'll recharge the battery.  So I go back to work and park and let it run and stuff and then Ben comes out and I tell him what happened and he shuts it off and tries to start it again and it won't.  I was like you idiot you weren't supposed to turn it off.  So then anyways I just work and then around 9 Aubrey comes in and I help her shop and then me, her, Chris and Ben are all looking at my car and jumping it and stuff.  So Chris used his car and it was going and I get in and put it in reverse and turn on the lights and it just dies.  So I turn it off and we hook it up to Ben's car to jump it and it won't even do anything.  I was like omg my car won't even freaking start!!  So Ben took me home and I told mom and dad and dad went and jumped and when he turned the lights on it died again because it took too much energy.  So today we're taking it to the auto shop thing and getting it fixed.  So I have to shower here and take Shaina's car to go clean mine all out and stuff.  Dad said it's not really the battery, it's something that regulates how much energy goes to stuff and like if you get too much it will blow your battery up, but mine is definately not getting enough since just turning on my lights makes it quit.  And my power locks wouldn't even work.  

So that was my eventful night.  At least Shaina has a car I can use.  I don't have to work until Thursday though so it might be done before then.  I just want my baby back.

So in other news...I laid out yesterday for half an hour in the pool and I got burned.  But in a few days it'll just be tan.  And if the sun stays out, I might go out around noon and tan again today.  But it's looking kinda rainy.  And I woke up this morning and made some cookies but I think I burned them all.  Not really burned, but they're a little dark.  They still taste good to me though.  And Shaina.  So I have to clean up my dishes, take a shower, go clean out my car and get some french fried onions and come back home and make dinner for tonight and then go lay out in the sun.  Sounds like a pretty laid back day to me.  And I have to like put my laundry away and stuff but that's not a big deal.  So I think I'm gonna go get started on my stuff.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Ok so I had fun with Jenny.  We hung out at The Sweet Tooth and just talked for a while and then went to the park and rolled down the big hill and talked and then went bowling and that was super fun and Nick is like the nicest guy ever, he bought pizza for us.  It was fun though and it was cheap!!  It was like $6.  I was like dang!!  Then I spent the night and got up and went to work on Saturday morning.  

Work wasn't too bad.  We had pizza for lunch.  I ate pizza so much last week I don't care if I don't eat any for another month.  I had it Tuesday at work, Wednesday with Aubrey, Friday night, and Sat for lunch.  By Saturday I was like no pizza for lunch.  But I asked Cory what he wanted to do since he was like I thought we were supposed to be a team, ask eachother what we want for lunch.  So I did and he wanted pizza, so that's what we had.  I hate facing and that was like the only thing to do on Saturday.  Thank gosh I left at 4 and wasn't there all night with Bob.  

Then Saturday night (last night I guess) I went to Bryan's house for a movie night.  It was me, Bryan, Katie Stafford, Scott Hasbro...I don't know how to spell it, and his friend Mike.  We watched a Knight's Tale and it was so good!  Bryan kept saying stupid stuff though like his dad got beheaded and he really didn't.  And he has the cutest puppies ever!!  So I didn't get home until like midnight.

Then I had to work this morning at 9.  Nicky was supposed to get there at 10 and she called in like at 9:40, leaving no time to get anyone to come in, so we were down a cashier today.  She was supposed to work 10-6 so I just worked 9-7 because we were really busy and stuff.  It wasn't all that bad though except we had to face.  Just because I hate it so much that's what he made me do.  Then we had to empty like all the bad dairy stuff into trash bags and keep the containers for credit or something.  So we had to trash bags of like yogurt and nasty stuff like that.  So me and Josie were trying to put them in the big dumpster out back and they're starting to rip and they're freaking heavy.  So Josie got all covered in like yogurt stuff and we finally get one bag in and then we can't get the other one in.  So Cory's laughing at us because we're weak so he helps us get it in and I turn around and he's like ha you got that shit all over your ass.  I'm like what are you doing looking at my butt.  So it was all over my smock and my butt and really nasty.  Then Ben and Ryan were like it looks like some guy came all over you.  Yeah they're just a great bunch to work with.  Then someone fell asleep today and Les came in like the guy that actually owns the place.  I was so worried that he got in trouble but I didn't wanna ask while Les was there.  So after he left I was like omg did he walk in on you sleeping and he was like nope I woke up right before he came in.  Sleeping on the job.  It's not like we were really doing anything today.  It was so boring.  

So it was like 7:30 before anyone left, and I was supposed to leave at 3.  Mom knows I always work later though when certain ppl are managers.  Some let me and some don't.  So after that I went to the gas station and was talking to Aubrey and then Josie came in and so we're just all sitting there talking and it's like 8 and I'm like crap I'm gonna get in trouble.  So I turn on my phone and yep I have a voicemail from mom so I call her and tell her and then I lost the call and I came home.  She wasn't mad though like I thought she'd be.  Which is way good for me.  She was just like ok.  So Aubrey is coming in tomorrow night after she gets out of work at 8 to talk to me and Josie again.  And she said she's gonna buy me a ""present"".  Her and Josie are gonna get me a vibrator.  I was like what the heck!!  Because I like don't do anything with anyone because I don't know why, I just don't.  I'm not just gonna make out with someone I'm not going out with, but I don't wanna go out with anyone.  So yep they're all like omg you haven't done anything.  She says she's gonna get it tomorrow morning, but I don't htink so.  Josie said she's gonna have us over somenight and just party.  And we can just stay at her house so we won't have to go home and she's like 50 something but she's so cool.    

But yeah today was pretty fun.  Me and Ben and Ryan were just going at it in the breakroom.  We were throwing salt shakers and Ryan shook it all in my hair and we were throwing Oatmeal Cream Pies and powdered sugar donuts.  It was a mess.  They were like you should go paintballing wiht us sometime and I was like what the heck.  No way.  You guys would all shoot me and no one else and yeah from what I hear it's pretty painful.  And besides I don't have a gun or stuff to wear and I always work Saturday mornings and that's when they go.  They were like we wouldn't all gang up on you, you're like one of us you know.  I was like yeah right, it's never happening.  

I think I should go to bed since I haven't gotten like a good nights rest in like so long.  I'm used to like 12 hours a night and I've been getting like 6.  And it's just not working for me.  I wanted to fall asleep today too.  Just be like yep sleeping party in the office.  So tomorrow I think I'll actually sleep in.  And go to bed early.  Sounds like a plan.  Tomorrow I'm going to call Caitlin and Megan, so be expecting me!  Ok time for bed.  Lots of Love!!"

"event","So I got my pictures done the other day!  I had to smile a lot and my mouth was just getting tired.  Hopefully they'll turn out ok though.  

I didn't really get to see Jenny.  :(  Shaina went and talked to her while I was getting my pics done, but they weren't open yet when she was getting hers done so I didn't get to talk to her.  So then for lunch afterwards we went to Subway and then I went over to see her, but she was at the park.  So Kelly called her to hurry back becasue I was there so I was just waiting for her and mom was like we really have to go I have other things to do today and she wouldn't even let me stay and talk.  I was so mad.  So I called Jenny and was like I have to go and she was like I'm almost there so as we were drivng away I saw her walking down the road.  I was really mad.  It's like hello mom I hardly ever see her anymore and the one chance I have, you can't just wait for like 10 minutes.  But we're hanging out today.  Mom was like why don't you do something with her so I was like tomorrow and she was like well ok.  So she has to babysit until 3 and so I'll just leave here at like 3.  I'm so excited though!!  We're gonna go to Aunt Barb's and swim and haha have some other kind of fun.  I was like what!?  But I have to work in the morning, so I don't know.  I asked mom if I could spend the night though, so just in case anything happens I can just crash there for the night.  But I have to get up at like 7:15 so I can get dressed and drive back by 8.  We'll have fun though.  I'm so excited!!

I finally got to talk to Caitlin yesterday for a decent amount of time!  We're so alike, it just makes me laugh.  If you know what I'm talking about ;) coughworkcough

I should probably go get showered and go in and check my work schedule.  I forgot to ask for Monday off, so I hope they didn't schedule me.  If they did, then I have to work out a few things.  

Well I hope everyone has a great day!!  Lots of Love!!"

"event","Hmm I'm just bored so I thought I'd write in here and then I have to write Megan a damn long e-mail because she's not home and I don't know where the heck she is!!  I know her cousin is coming up sometime like she was around the 4th of July and she's probably with her somewhere, but I'm not sure where that is and I've tried calling her on Sunday, Monday, not yesterday I don't think, and then today and she's just not there!  So I'll write her an e-mail, even though it's not as good as talking.  It'll just have to do.  I miss her though!  Megan I miss you!  Come back home!!

And then Miss Caitlin and I keep having stuff to do and not getting to talk.  Yesterday she had to work at 7 and I had to work until 4 so when I did call her, she had to go get ready and stuff and then she wasn't supposed to work today but she did and I called at like 6:30 ish so she had to go again!!  I think I'm just having bad luck in the friend department.  

But I'm doing pretty good in some other departments ;)  Won't go into too much detail since I think you can all figure it out.  We're just talking right now, not really anything more.  But who knows.  Haahahh :)  I'm happy though.

Work was so funny the other day.  Me and Cole and Cory were stocking Jello and Cole asked me out of nowhere if I'd ever seen a weiner before.  I was like what the f***!  He's like do you wanna?  I was like no I'm good thanks.  Weird ass kid.  It was funny though.  Who says weiner anyways?  Fun times at work though.  

Ugh Aubrey called me at like 9:50 this morning and was like wanna go shopping?  So I got out of bed and asked mom and she's like ok so Aubrey was like be here in 20 minutes.  And it takes like around 15 just to get to her house.  I was like I have to shower!  She was like no we have to go so I can get to my grandma's house!  So I went out today without showering.  My hair looked nasty.  So we went to her grandmas and she lived like far away.  Like a half hour or more. But she was super nice.  Then we came back to Jackson and went shopping at one mall first, then ate at CiCi's and then went to the other mall and then home.  It was fun though, just a girls day out.  Dang does she get a lot of calls though!  Her aunt was asking her about tomorrow and called like a few times and her friend called becasue she's having her baby like tomorrow and then she was talking to this hot guy she used to know becasue she saw his little brother.  I was like whoa!

Then I had to be home by 2 so we could leave for our senior picture appointment by 2:30 and I had to shower.  I'm excited for my pictures tomorrow though!  The actual people that take them are like these two girls and they're like a year or two older than me so they were really fun to talk to and everything and I think they're gonna turn out really good!  Then I went to the Sweet Tooth right across the street and talked to Bonnie and Howard because Jenny wasn't there today.  But she will be tomorrow so I'll talk to her then.  Yay!!  I have all my outfits picked out and everything though so I'm good to go.  And Albion has a lot of parks so I think my pictures will be good.  Shaina's are at 10 and mine are at 12.  Then I have to work from 4-8 with Bob.  Ugh.  Hopefully it'll go fast though.  

I think I need to go write Megan's e-mail and then go to bed.  I was up until like midnight last night watching James Bond but I fell asleep.  And then I was woken up this morning before I wanted to be.  And I have to get up early tomororw.  Ugh!!  Ha we got the cell phone bill today.  Between me and Shaina we used 700 minutes.  I only used like 300 though.  She had like 409 or something like that.  Dad was like who's number is 2552...Cindy and I was like um that's Shaina's.  Then he was like well you still used 300 minutes.  That's like 5 hours.  I was like ok.  I mean we have 900 for the whole family to use.  And we didn't even have any extra charges.  So I don't know what he was complaining about.  And I got the lecture about how ppl need to call the house first even though Shaina talked way more than me.  And 5 hours for an entire month is not bad at all.  Dang.  Whatever.  I'm outta here.  Lots of Love!!"

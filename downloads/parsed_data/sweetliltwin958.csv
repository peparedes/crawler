"event","I just had the perfect night EVER:)  Fee went to Ricky's so I was home alone for a little bit. I ate dinner *ugh left overs* n played with my lil brother chris:) he loves me, he kept grabbing onto my legs n stuff so I couldn't move but hey hes cute an' lil so its alright.  After that Eddie came home and I went to his house. We went ridin for a little bit cus justin speilburg was there too. not that I mind..haha i still get to hang out with eddie:)  Anyway we got back to eddies around 8ish..we played pool. let me just say I am a pool *ALL STAR* yup thats right I'll be on ESPN someday doin all them trick shots..haha yeah..right..I suck really bad :) but its okay cus I have fun doing bad.  Anyway, the most amazing part of my WHOLE night was having eddie say he believed me, I prolly smiled almost all night about that..just cus I was so happy..n things are SO perfect..I wouldn't trade it for anything. I haven't been this happy in SUCH a long time it just feels so good to be so happy:) its 10 now..n im not even tired at all. fee isn't even home yet..which i dont care about cus I'm never here without her so its nice to be without her. My mom left us money tomorrow night for pizza cus shes going to the nursing home to visit my grandma n jim's workin on some job er something like that. Ok ima go:)..first ima put a little love *ditty* in here haha:)

It's YOU. You mean everything to me...you are the first into my head in the morning when I wake up, my last thought before I go to bed, you smile at me in my dreams, when you are sad I feel sad and when I see your true smile, I feel incredible, like there is no other thing around and all I can see is you"

"event","Oh man..what an intersting day I suppose. Got up at like 10ish an' talked to eddie till he left for the car auction. Took a shower n made lunch n talked to Nicky for awhile after that. Around 2:30 eddie came home..he dind't get his car..which sucks n he was in a bad mood. I tried to make him feel better but I dont think it worked.  Felicia kept being a dyke when me n eddie were actually having a serious converstation on the phone.  I dunno..I know what I did to him before hurt him and everything..but now he dosen't believe me. I guess he dosen't understand what he means to me now cus of what I did to him before.  I get really sad when he doesn't believe me..sometimes I even cry about it just because I'm afraid to loose him now that he means so much to me..I guess time will just let things get better.  Anywho..now im finishing watching general hospital..eatin dinner n hopefully goin to eddies house:) I'll write later maybe"

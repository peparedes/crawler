"event","It was inevitable that Peter would introduce Regulus to <i>Doctor Who</i> at some point. After all, the Doctor had been around since 23 November 1963, and Peter loved science fiction.

Peter wasn't sure how Regulus would feel about the show; his friend had only just been introduced to the concept of television in the past week or so. Muggle inventions were rather new to Regulus.  Peter could only hope that he'd would like it.

""Reg!"" he called from the living room. ""Come on! The Doctor'll be on in a few minutes. You don't want to miss any of it."""

"event","For the next week or so after the lecture, Peter wrote in the Inn-provided book every chance he got.  Most of his yearmates didn't notice; they were too busy revising for NEWTs. Two months wasn't very long to study when your entire future hung on the outcome of several competency tests.

And Peter understood this. He, too, studied, as he'd been doing for rather longer than he liked to recall.

But he also spent day after day scribbling in the book, plotting a bloodless revolution.

The Monday after the Lecture, Peter was outside, sprawled on the grass, writing. Life, at the moment, seemed very good."

"event","<lj-cut text=""That Flighty Temptress, the Order"">Eventually, even the worst had to be faced.  The day came when Peter simply didn't want to put off Dumbledore's lecture any longer. He had no desire to be talked down to, patronised, condescended to, but he sensed that it was time to get the lecture over with.

Besides, and this was very much to the point, Dumbledore's poor opinion of him mattered less now than it had before.  His conversation with Lily Evans from a parallel universe had told him that he <I>did</I> have courage.  Maybe it wasn't flashy, like James's or Sirius's. Maybe it didn't have the quiet dignity of Remus's. But it was there.

And his talks with Teppic had convinced him that the war was a disaster, and the Ministry no less so. The fear of Muggles, the widespread ignorance about them, the absymal political and judicial system, the refusal to grant non-humans equal rights, making them prime targets for Voldemort...it had to stop, and it had to stop now. Even if Voldemort was defeated tomorrow--and Peter didn't believe that would happen for a minute--if nothing changed, then in twenty or thirty years, the same thing would be happening all over again. Just in time to kill Peter's kids, and the kids of his contemporaries. Not an acceptable alternative.

Activism. That was what the wizarding world needed. That and a bloodless revolution. It didn't need Voldemort, and it certainly didn't need to maintain the status quo. The status quo was what had got them into this mess in the first place.

It would take time, of course. Years. Decades, maybe.  And he couldn't do it all on his own.   But he had a feeling that he wouldn't have to.

Thinking all this, Peter collected his books--and a new blank-paged, leather-bound book that the Inn had provided--and walked out the door into Hogwarts Castle once more.

Dumbledore was waiting when he walked into the Headmaster's Office. ""Sit down, Mr Pettigrew,"" he said solemnly.

Peter sat.

Dumbledore was silent for a long time.  <I>Trying to wear on my nerves</I>, Peter thought, and mentally shrugged. There were a lot worse things than having someone sit and stare at you. 

At last, the elder wizard spoke. ""Do you know why I called you here?""

Now was the time to throw himself on Dumbledore's mercy, but Peter found that he didn't want his headmaster's mercy. He hadn't done anything that demanded mercy or forgiveness.

""Because I created images on the ceiling of the Great Hall,"" he said steadily. ""And you think that either the ceiling has been destroyed--and it hasn't, the images will fade in twenty-four hours and the ceiling go back to normal--or you believe that this is something that James and Sirius dreamed and/or did, and that I am unfairly grabbing the credit. Well, they didn't dream it up; they had nothing to do with it. I did it all.""

So saying, he turned around, faced the door and created a lovely image upon it of the Fourth Doctor emerging from the TARDIS. Feeling that this settled matters--it wasn't an image he'd used on the ceiling, after all--he turned back to Dumbledore. ""I thought you were going to make me wait while you talked things over with McGonagall.""

""<I>Professor</I> McGonagall,"" Dumbledore said absently, staring at the door. ""How did you do that?""

""A combination of Charms and Transfiguration. And a lot of practice.""

Dumbledore, Peter was gratified to notice, was looking a bit wild-eyed. ""You--a combination?""

Peter nodded.  ""It's mostly a question of control--keeping the images sharp, clear and focused.""

""But you can't maintain them more than twenty-four hours.""

""I don't know whether I could or not,"" he said honestly. ""I wasn't interested in creating images that lasted. I wanted to create good temporary images that would fade without doing any damage to the ceiling or its spell.""

Dumbledore steepled his fingers and gazed at the boy with the kindly expression that always set Peter's teeth on edge. ""Peter. No one has cast such a spell in at least a thousand years."" 

""So?""

""Not since the time of the Founders has anyone succeeded in performing such a task.""

""Yes, I know,"" said Peter, wondering where this was going.

""Surely you are not claiming to be the equal of the Founders!""

""I'm not claiming anything,"" Peter said patiently. ""I just cast a number of spells to create an effect similar to the one on the Great Hall ceiling. Besides, the Founders weren't the Founders--not as we know them today. A thousand years ago, they were just a couple of witches and a couple of wizards trying to build a school of magic. They weren't <I>demigods</I>.""

Dumbledore looked shocked beyond reason. Peter sighed, and fell silent, certain that the lecture would resume in moments.

""Why""--and Dumbledore's voice sounded infinitely more strained now--""did you perform this...these...spells publicly?""

""Well, there wouldn't have been much point in doing it secretly, would there?""

""I mean...surely you know that some of the students do not share your opinion of Lord Voldemort.""

<I>Oh, get off. You don't even know what my opinion is.</I> ""You mean, I should have concealed my abilities so that no one who might end up on Voldemort's side would know about them.""

""Exactly. There are dangers to such actions, and you took a serious risk. Most immature, Peter. Most unwise.""

Peter gazed seriously at Dumbledore. ""I wanted people to see what I could do,"" he said, enunciating every syllable. ""I'm tired of being taken for granted as the inept also-ran, the fat little boy who tags along after James and Sirius, the one who's 'not quite in their league, magically.'  James and Sirius are great at magic--yes, I admit that--but I'm not hopeless at it. I may not be as flashy as they are, but I'm far from incapable. Ask Madam Pomfrey if you don't believe me.  The Slytherins know this, even if they don't like me--they've had enough run-ins with the four of us over the years. It's the STAFF I have a hard time convincing. The staff--and the Headmaster--needed a public demonstration. So you got one.""

""But, Peter,"" spluttered Dumbledore, ""I've always known you were capable--""

""Is that why you insisted I was lying until I demonstrated on your door?""

Dumbledore flinched at that. Mentally, Peter cheered and set off fireworks.

""If there's nothing else, sir..."" he said, and started to stand up.

""Sit down,"" Dumbledore said gently. ""Tell me, what do you think should happen to you as the result of this--demonstration?""

""Well,"" said Peter, thinking that he might as well go for broke, ""I really think that I've earned Outstandings in Charms and Transfiguration, and that I shouldn't have to take the NEWT for either.""

""Is that the best you can think of?"" said Dumbledore, sounding grievously disappointed.

<I>Two guaranteed Os on my NEWTs would be great</I>, Peter thought. <I>Three if you count Potions.  All I'd have to worry about then would be Herbology and Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Getting into the Healer program would be easy then.</I>

""I'm not sure what you're asking me, sir,"" he said quietly.

""Doubtless you have heard of Lord Voldemort's armies,"" Dumbledore said, eyes dramatically aglow.  ""The humans and the Dark Creatures alike that flock to his side, hungry for the taste of power, blood and death...""

<I>How very Mills & Boon,</I> Peter thought.

""Doubtless,"" Dumbledore continued, ""you have feared for your life, and the lives of your family and friends, especially with no one to bring his war of conquest to a halt. But now...now there are those who would have chosen to fight him....an organization, founded by myself, called the Order of the Phoenix...""

Peter listened as Dumbledore rambled on about the Order. The group was scarcely formed--only a handful of wizards and witches. One or two members were disreputable, and there were a few older ones--like Dumbledore, supposedly. However, most, the Headmaster made clear, were young. Recent graduates of Hogwarts. Some were still students.

<I>Schoolkids</I>, thought Peter with sick horror. <I>Dumbledore's trying to fight You-Know-Who with old people and crooks and schoolkids.</I>

<I>Why?</I> he shouted silently. <I>Why US?</I>

Because they were expendable. It was as simple as that. Dumbledore might care about his students; he might want them to be loyal. But in the end, their main value was that the fact that they were young, reckless and stupid, willing to risk their lives as if it were a game.

""...was wondering if you would like to join us, Peter, "" concluded Dumbledore.

There was only one possible answer to that.

""No, thank you.""

""What?"" said Dumbledore, as if a chair had spoken.

""No, thank you,"" said Peter steadily. ""I'm not a warrior. I'm a Healer. That's what I'm good at it. I'd be no da-<b>darned</b> good at killing people, or hurting them. And I don't want to waste my time trying.""

""You should be willing to fight for the freedoms you enjoy,"" Dumbledore said sternly.

""I am,"" said Peter, thinking of Teppic and their conversations. ""But I don't see any good coming from this.""

""Your friends have joined. They were asked over Easter vacation.""

<I>How nice of you to finally ask me,</I> Peter thought. <I>You really <b>didn't</b> think I was any use until now, did you?</I>

""That's their business,"" he said aloud. ""I'm not their shadow. I don't have to do everything that they do.""

""And are you not concerned for their safety?""

""I've been concerned for it for seven years,"" Peter said quietly. ""And I've kept them from being hurt, as best I could. I kept Remus alive. You know that.""

Dumbledore looked away. ""I do know. That is why I'm amazed at you. You do not lack for courage. How can you ignore the call of Gryffindor?""

""Because this isn't about a mystical call to arms,"" Peter said. ""It's a civil war. And wars, ultimately, aren't about glory or mysticism. They're about wounding, killing and which side has the bigger, more powerful battalions. I'm going to heal wounds, not inflict them.  That's important too.  Vital, you might say. Especially,"" he added softly, ""to those who are maimed or wounded in battle.""

""Peter,"" and Dumbledore now looked so shattered that only a saint contemplating man's inhumanity to man could have surpassed him, ""your skills are extraordinary. I beg you, do not waste them.""

""I won't, sir,"" Peter replied. ""But neither will I join the Order. Or Voldemort, if that's what you're worried about.""

The startlement on Dumbledore's face said that that was precisely what he had been worried about.

The wrangling went back and forth for some time, but the discussion effectively ended then. At last, Peter stood up, gathering his books.

""I don't think we're going to accomplish any more by discussing this.  If you don't mind, sir, I'll leave. I still have homework to do for tomorrow. I trust that you're satisfied that my abilities are my own, and that no lying or cheating was involved.""

""Yes,"" said Dumbledore bitterly, ""I am--in that respect--satisfied.There will be no loss of points for Gryffindor.

""But in another respect, I am profoundly dissatisfied. I cannot tell you how gravely disappointed I am in you, Peter.""

Peter knew that before he'd met Teppic, those words would have shaken him to his core. Now  they meant nothing.

""Well, sir,"" he said, ""you've been disappointed in me for the past seven years. I don't think that two more months will make any difference.

""Good luck, by the way. I think that you're going to need it.""

And with that, he turned around and walked out, quietly closing the door.</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""In which Peter plays a trick, and all does not go as smoothly as he'd hoped."">Peter had been practicing the Transfiguration Trick for months, and now it was time to try it. He knew that he still wanted to continue practicing, but he also knew well enough that he was stalling.  He'd delayed too long already--first because he suspected McGonagall would kill him if he did something so irreverent on Easter Sunday, and then again because there weren't enough students at Hogwarts over the spring hols to make an impression.

He waited until the evening meal on the Monday that classes resumed; he didn't want to have to compete with morning or afternoon classes for peoples' attention. He was too nervous to eat much. Fortunately, no one noticed.

About mid-way through the meal, he silently cast the first Charm--<i>Aholomora</i>--and the doors to the Great Hall flew open. A non-verbal <i>Mobilicorpus</i>, and the Giant Squid (which had been floating in a water-filled bubble of air for over an hour) drifted into the Great Hall.  Before more than a few snickers could erupt, Peter cast the musical Charm <i>Symphoniam Canto</i> followed by <i>Wingardium Leviosa</i>, sending the Squid spiraling up to the ceiling to the tune of Queen's <a href=""http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~choh/anato.htm"">""Bohemian Rhapsody""</a>. It even looked as if the Squid was doing the singing.

Gripping his poplar wand beneath the table, he waved it in the intricate gesture that would cast the Barrier Charm which would protect the existing charm on the ceiling. The ceiling that resembled the sky by both day and night was one of Hogwarts' treasures, and Peter had no desire to destroy that. He made the Squid swoop down across the first section of the ceiling, which made it look as though the Squid was creating the barrier, colourless and opaque, which was following in its wake. An upward swoop--and suddenly that section of the ceiling transformed from starry skies to Earthrise, as seen from the moon.

Another downward swoop by the Squid, and another portion of the ceiling was protected by the Barrier Charm. Another upward swoop, and another image appeared--this one, the cantina scene from <i>Star Wars</i>. And it was moving.

On and on, images materialized to the tune of ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" A mating flight of dragons, performing a slow and languorous dance across the sky. Two teams playing rugby. A bakery so vivid that one could almost smell the breads, cakes and pastries. Starships zooming through space. A Highland landscape in autumn. A phoenix, weeping over a bloody battlefield. A picture of the Outside Inn for McGonagall. Sixty-four larger-than-life images in all, some moving, some not. 

And finally it was done. The Squid's bubble leaned forward in a kind of bow, and then floated out as gracefully as it had arrived, the doors opening for it and then closing afterwards. Peter closed his eyes, hurrying the Squid back to the waters of its lake home.

He had just put the Squid back in the lake when he heard Dumbledore speak in a voice like thunder. ""Who has done this?""

<i>Now for the hard part.</i> 

Peter stood up, casting a surreptitious <i>Sonorus</i> Charm to ensure that everyone could hear him; he was under no illusions about how well his voice carried under normal circumstances. ""I did,"" he said, enunciating as clearly as he was able.

Dumbledore gazed at him sternly, ""Mr Potter, Mr Black, Mr Lupin and Pettigrew, report to my office--""

""No!"" Peter yelled, for the first time understanding what ""seeing red"" meant. There really did seem to be a reddish mist across his vision. And he was too angry to care.

""No?"" Dumbledore inquired in a voice as cold as liquid hydrogen.

""No,"" said Peter, his voice carrying to every corner of the Hall. ""You're not <i>listening</i>. <b>I</b> did this. Not them. ME! They didn't know anything about it!"" 

Which, he reflected, should have been perfectly obvious, judging by Sirius's gape-mouthed expression, Remus's evident bewilderment and the flabbergasted look sprawling all over James's features. But then, adults were not always observant, he'd found. Especially when they thought they were being clever.

""You!"" That was McGonagall.

<i>Yes, Professor</i>, Peter thought, <i>and you know it, too. I know that young Min remembers in there somewhere.</i>

""Peter,"" said Dumbledore in that wise-yet-sorrowful old mentor voice that invariably set Peter's teeth on edge, ""why would you do something like this?""

<i>Because I had to,</i> Peter thought. <i>You proved that when you assumed that the other three had been part of this and that I was just trying to grab all the credit.</i>

Dumbledore stood waiting for an answer. Peter ignored him, and directed his answer to McGonagall.

""Out of curiosity, have you ever done anything like this? Something very tricky that you felt you had to do?""

He thought he saw a flicker of recognition in McGonagall's expression, but he couldn't be sure.

Dumbledore stared at him for a long time. At last he spoke. ""Go to my office immediately, Mr Pettigrew, and wait there. Your Head of House and I have much to discuss.""

Peter sighed, nodded, grabbed his books, quills and parchment, and exited the Hall, feeling as if he were impaled on a thousand eyes.

He did head in the direction of Dumbledore's office. Really, he did.

It wasn't his fault that when he turned a corner, he found himself <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/outsideinn/32452.html"">walking into the Inn</a> once more.</lj-cut>"

This actually makes sense in terms of Peter's dynamic in the Marauders, and in view of his later choices. He seems to be an appeasing sort in canon; he's always either going along with someone else's wishes, or trying to convince someone that something isn't a good idea. And he stubbornly sticks with a bad decision that he clearly hates for years."

"event","<lj-cut text=""In Hogwarts' Library"">It's Saturday afternoon--Holy Saturday, in fact--and Peter's in the library of Hogwarts. Much, it must be added, to the consternation of his friends, who are convinced that he must be suffering from some dire illness. Who studies during school holidays?  He's had to make a lot of excuses, most of them involving a passionate need to ace his upcoming N.E.W.T.s. So he's studying ahead of time. That way, he can shock everybody with his brilliant marks.

James thinks that he must be suffering from a virulent strain of dragon pox. Sirius thinks that he's been hit with the Confundus Charm once too often by some Slytherin.  Remus says they have a bet going.

And yet, the funny thing is, it's almost the truth. He really is studying for a test, even though it's not one that the Examiners will give.

He's practiced bits of the whole routine--not all of it, of course, but some. He's found that he can Summon the Squid and keep it surrounded by enough water to keep it breathing, as well as making it bob around in a semi-graceful manner. He can--sort of--duplicate the sound of ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Unfortunately, it sounds rather tinny, not unlike the wireless in his flat. And he's managed to create a scene or two on various surfaces--tables, flagstones, walls. But they've all been a bit blurry, and not at all well-defined.

The results, overall, aren't bad. They'd probably get him an Exceeds Expectations in class.

And that's not good enough. He doesn't want an Exceeds Expectations; he knows bloody well that his professors don't expect anything from him that's even close to what they expect of James, Sirius and Remus. What he's done so far would garner them Acceptables. Maybe. If they were lucky. Exceeding low expectations is useless. He has to do an outstanding, superb, perfect job, something that'll make everyone gasp...or really, what's the <b>point</b>?

He sighs, gets up from the library study table and--ignoring the suspicious looks Madam Pince is giving him--goes down an aisle to retrieve <i>Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes</i>. Maybe there'll be something in the book that can help him improve his Transfiguration of the ceiling.

He isn't expecting the aisle to lead to <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/outsideinn/26975.html"">the Outside Inn</a>.</lj-cut>"

The lake isn't frozen, but it has a sort of murky middle-of-winter look to it. The Forbidden Forest--visible from the lake--is a dark mass of snow-laden trees. Hogwarts Castle, in all of its massive, turreted glory, lies straight ahead.

"event","Peter supposes that his friends think he's gone nuts, since he's been spending a lot of time at the library for the past couple of months. He's not sure if they know he's been sneaking into the Restricted Section; if they do, it's not because he told them.

He's been there a lot for two reasons--upcoming N.E.W.T.s (which he is worried about--he's not James or Sirius, who can stroll into any exam without studying and get top marks every single time) and, what's more important, researching the right way to do that spell he and Anakin talked about. The one involving the Giant Squid and the ceiling of the Great Hall.

What's vital, he's decided, is creating a barrier between his transfiguration and the ancient spell which causes the ceiling to reflect the outside sky. He doesn't want to destroy that charm...just change the ceiling's appearance temporarily. 

It's tricky. Very tricky. It means casting multiple spells in quick succession, and maintaining all of them--levitating the Squid, creating a watery environment around the Squid so that it can continue to breathe, moving the Squid slowly, holding the barrier steady, painting vivid scenes as the Squid moves over the ceiling--at the same time. It'll take both power and a great deal of will and concentration.

If he can manage to make the Squid sing ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" while he's doing all this, he'll be thrilled.

He knows there's going to be trouble about this. <i>McGonagall is going to positively KILL me.</i> But that's not really the point. He also knows that what he's planning would be a challenge for a fully-trained adult wizard. But that's not really the point either.

The point is, he <i>has</i> to. He's tired of being the also-ran, the one who's consistently underestimated by teachers and students alike.  He's tired of James and Sirius getting sole credit for things he planned. He's tired of them being the stars and him always being in the shadows. 

He needs to prove that he's  neither stupid nor useless, and that he's got power and skill in his own right. And he needs to do so publicly--preferably at dinner--so that everyone in school will get the message at once. And of course, so that he can say, openly and immediately, that he did it. Before any of the other three can grab the credit.

It probably wouldn't make sense to anyone else, but he has to do this. He's going to be a Healer when he gets out of school; it's what he's good at.  But there's nothing dramatic about a Healer. Quite a few people, he knows, will assume that he simply drifted into that profession because he wasn't much good for anything else.

So...one shot. One chance to prove that he's not a useless lump. That he's <i>worth</i> something.  That he won't forever be James's and Sirius's friend"" or ""Remus's friend"" to the people he respects, or treated with lightly-coated contempt by the people he detests, but someone in his own right. Someone who deserves respect.

That's all. 

That's everything.

And so he bends low over a stack of restricted books, studies and scribbles notes...for the sake of a prank that's no longer a prank at all."

"event","Older Peter's room is notably warm, well-lit and, with the exception of the desk, scrupulously clean. Blinds--in a half-up, half-down position--hang on the two windows. A white closet door lies to the left of the left window. A bedspread in autumnal shades of gold, orange, scarlet and brown covers the bed, which sits crossways in the center of the room.  It matches the wall-to-wall carpet, which is a soft yellow.

There is a narrow space between the foot of the bed and an executive's chair with soft, crimson cushions. The chair is pushed up against a large oaken desk with a multitude of drawers and crannies.  The desk is piled high with highlighted medical books, cups of coffee, Potions ingredients, and notebooks filled with cryptic pieces of information, bits of Latin and Greek, and the odd mnemonic.

Two immense and solid bookcases face each other, one on either side of the bed. They are filled with a number of books--a medical dictionary, more books on medicine (both the magical and the Muggle varieties) texts about history (ditto), Potions books, and quite a few novels...classic, historical, mysteries, science fiction, and so on.  The books seem to be sorted according to genre, and then alphabetically.

On the blue-tinged white walls are paintings--landscapes and cityscapes, mostly. Given pride of place, however, are two photographs. The first is of a short plump dark man and a tall, blonde-haired woman, both very young and in old-fashioned wedding garb. The second shows the same woman, now fiftysomething and unsmiling, three tall, dark young women in their twenties or thirties, and a short plump blond boy of ten or eleven. All are dressed in their stiff, uncomfortable best; the flowery hats on the women suggest that this picture was probably taken in the spring.  

The room is illuminated with a blaze of electric light from an overhead fixture, a floor lamp beside the bed and a reading lamp on the desk."

"event","Young Peter's room is geek city, and looks smaller than it is thanks to the untidiness.  Books--a combination of magic textbooks, well-thumbed science books of the 1970s and science fiction novels, the latest published in 1977--are strewn around the room, some left face down, others stacked in asymmetrical piles, and some scattered across his bed. A painstakingly crafted hand-made quilt (the mirror of the quilt on his bed back in Birmingham, in fact) lies carefully folded atop the foot of the royal blue bedspread. A firmly closed closet door--white, like all of the woodwork in the room--lies opposite the bed.

A few posters decorate the white-and-gold walls--again, mostly of the scientific and science fiction variety. The most prominent is a Muggle photograph of one of the American astronauts on the moon. The two windows in the room are hung with gold drapes, while the gleaming wooden floor is partially covered by a gold-edged blue rug.

Three or four notebooks are open on a large oaken desk that has a remarkable number of drawers and crannies. Most of the notebooks detail scientific or potions experiments, complete with notes on how the experiments worked. A couple show a half-written campaign for a futuristic RPG play-by-mail (or in Peter's case, play by message sent by owl post and then transferred to the Muggle post office) involving planetary colonies, space battles and starships. Resting atop one notebook is a set of bright green plastic dice--four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided and twenty-sided. There is also a bag of potions ingredients on the desk, along with some beakers and vials, as well as the odd mug or two that he's plainly used when all the other receptacles were occupied.

The room is illuminated with a blaze of electric light from an overhead fixture, a floor lamp beside the bed and a goose-necked reading lamp on the desk."

"event","Done for <lj comm=""theatrical_muse"">:

<b>What is the biggest lie you ever told? What were its consequences?</b>

The biggest lie I ever told? Oh, there wasn't just one. There was a whole series. I told them to myself, and I believed every word.

The funny thing is, I didn't know at the time that they were lies. Or maybe I didn't want to know. That's more probable. 

So what were the lies?

<lj-cut text=""The list of lies"">That Voldemort had chosen me for torture and turning at random.  I didn't want to think that there was some fundamental weakness in me that he or his agents had spotted.  

That I didn't see myself as a strong person. Others were tortured by Voldemort and died.  James would have goaded Voldemort into killing him; Remus would have been coldly sardonic, and made his killers feel his superiority; Sirius would have defied him with the pride of a dying prince.  I didn't have their calm assurance, their courage, their raw nerve. The torture and pain were unbearable; but more unbearable was the feeling of hopelessness.  I saw only endless vistas of pain and madness stretching out into my future.  I never believed that they would stop if they didn't get what they wanted. It never occurred to me that I might be able to win by dying.  I fought. I resisted.  But not with any belief in my own strength; only with the helpless despair of the child who knows the bullies will hurt him beyond endurance eventually, but who is trying to hold them off for one minute longer.

I did not see Voldemort or the Death Eaters as foemen but as bullies.  And bullies, in my experience, always won. They always made you give them what they wanted.  There was no way to stop it.

And believing this, I was lost before I began.

There were other ways that my mind conspired against me. For one thing, I didn't believe that I had any courage; how could I have courage when I was so terrified that I could scarcely think? I had courage confused with fearlessness, and this too played a part-- for how could I resist forever without courage to help me.  I didn't realise that I could be brave; I only looked at James, Remus and Sirius, saw their boldness, strength and guts, and knew that I was nowhere near their nerveless bravery.  They were the strong ones. I was strong, but only around them, or for them. Not on my own. That I could be brave and strong on my own was so far from my experience, I didn't even consider it a possibility.

Then, too, I feared Voldemort's people, and didn't know how or if I could resist them. They were the aristocrats, the nobles, the lords and ladies of princely blood.  If there was darkness in them, it was a darkness they had chosen. And there I was, petty Peter Pettigrew, the baker's boy from Birmingham.  I had grown up with consciousness of my own innate corruption dinned into my ears--the magic, the damnable magic that I could not escape or cast from me. I would have given  anything to rid myself of magic. My dearest wish, in those days, was to wake up free of the magic I had spent seven years honing. I wanted time to run backwards and allow me to grow up ordinary, free of the magic that had cost me the love of my mother, the tolerance of my peers and the acceptance of the Church.

In this, I was a virtual gift to the Death Eaters. I was a Muggleborn wizard who hated and despised myself nearly as much as Voldemort and his minions did..  And I accepted the Death Eaters as my superiors almost without thinking.  They were the bluebloods. They had the titles and the money. 

How they must have laughed.

But the worst lie of all was that, once I had turned, I could not ask anyone for help, nor could I help myself.

I could have gone to Dumbledore. He would have helped. I know that now. I could have asked James, or Sirius, or Remus.  They would have been horrified, but they would have broken their necks to get me free.

Instead, I began to hate them. I blamed them for not noticing when I was absent, for not recognising pain-filled movements born of Crucio and Carna Corruptis, for failing to see that I always wore  long-sleeved shirts in the summer now.  I wanted them to see that something was wrong before I spoke of it.  It did not occur to me that they  might have indeed noticed that something about my behaviour was off, but that, English fashion, they had chosen not to speak of  it, lest they be considered rude.

It did not occur to me that I was blaming and hating them because it was so much easier than blaming and hating myself.</lj-cut>

And the consequences for those lies? They continue. And I and others are still caught in the fallout.

Will I ever free myself from those lies?

I don't know.

God help me--I don't know."

"event","Peter is now in the House of Arch, pretending to nurse a hangover.  He does not, of course, have one--the hangover potions he makes have seen to that. But it provides an adequate excuse for not returning to the bar.

He does not know if he will ever return to Milliways. Returning does not seem worth the candle.

Not after Morpheus betrayed him as he did.

It is clear to Peter that Morpheus's plan would not have worked as he had thought. After all, Liz had sensed Morpheus's intent. So much for the shielding of her mind that was to keep her safe and sane.

He had trusted Dream. Trusted Dream to think of them, as well as himself. He had trusted Dream to know that such a risk--a risk which will hurt all of them in one way or another--was not acceptable.

He had trusted Dream to see that those who were to be affected by his actions should know about them. At the very least, they deserve the right to speak up about something that could destroy them.

He had trusted Dream to have the brains to comprehend that a friend may disagree mightily but still remain a friend.

He had trusted Dream to realise that all of his worry, for Liz, for Moiraine, and for Dream himself, had stemmed from love.

And instead he has been dismissed. Shut out. Treated as if he were garbage.

He does not need this.

It is perfectly obvious that Dream has chosen to be offended. God forbid that a mortal have the temerity to disagree with the Lord of Dreams, oh yes. Never mind that he has risked his life and sanity for Dream. Never mind that he has tried to offer Dream comfort at when he is in pain. No matter that he has kept all of Dream's secrets, save this one. No matter that Peter helped patch up a millions-of-years long feud between Dream and Desire by the same blunt speaking that Dream so despised last night. 

No matter that he has given his friendship, his loyalty and his aid a thousand times over. None of it counts, because Dream has decided that it does not.

Well, the friendship is over. Unless Dream apologises for flying off the handle, that is. Peter has no hope of that ever happening. That would require Dream to admit that he had been wrong. And Dream could never admit that.

Peter does not know how long he will absent himself from the bar. He does not, in truth, care. Dream's treachery was one betrayal too many in his life.

If Sirius felt like this before he left the bar, Peter can understand why he left so abruptly.  There is, after all, nothing to stay for--nothing save more heartache, and watching the woman he loves be destroyed or driven insane by Dream's folly. 

He does not think he will be able to endure that.

<i>It is not given to mortals to love the Endless,</i> Desire told him once.

Now Peter understands why."

"event","An owl arrives at the House of Arch's owlery, bearing a parchment scroll, sealed with sealing wax, addressed to ""Moiraine, Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, Milliways, care of Peter Pettigrew, House of Arch, London Below.""  The letter itself reads as follows:

<lj-cut text=""A Letter From Dumbledore""><i>To Moiraine, Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah:

I am indeed familiar with Milliways.  I travelled to it many times while preparing for the battle with the Dark Lord Grindelwald.  I have never met anyone from your world, but the parallels between our worlds cannot be denied. Somehow, I do not doubt that you would guard young Harry with your life, as I do not doubt you have done in the past for the youth known as the Dragon Reborn.

Through the young woman whom you know as Tonks, I had obtained a copy of Peter Pettigrew's confession some weeks prior to my receipt of your letter. As a boy, Peter had--still, apparently, does have--a frighteningly accurate memory. Peter has not tried to be representative of his crimes. Instead, he has detailed each one: what he did, where and when, how and why, and to whom. It makes for an ugly tale, for he makes no excuses, and justifies little. 

I honestly wish I had not read his confession; it is a terrible document. I feel no joy at knowing how far Peter had fallen.  

And yet...I can see Peter before me, his head bowed as he confesses in a shamed, self-hating whisper. He is legally dead in my world; he has been presumed dead since the day after the deaths of Harry's parents, fifteen years ago. Moreover, for the past year he has stood relatively high in Voldemort's favour. He truly has no reason to reveal his survival to the government or to expose his myriad crimes to the Aurors; it does not make him safer or more secure. Quite the opposite, in fact.

Despite knowing all this, I still wondered. I could envision Peter throwing himself on the mercy of the Aurors if he were in sudden and potentially lethal trouble with Voldemort's followers. Aurors are not noted for their merciful qualities, yet they would be kinder than Death Eaters would.

That, however, was before I read your letter.

The Peter you describe has far more in common with the young man I invited to join the Order of the Phoenix than with the Death Eater he became. That he has taken up Healing again is one of the best signs that I could have asked for; magical Healing in my world has much to do with the emotions--particularly compassion and empathy.  Evil men and women are rarely capable, or even functional, Healers.

I find myself oddly touched that he would choose to re-create Lake Hogwarts, the Whomping Willow and the Shrieking Shack. (The original Shack, by the way, is actually in a village near the school called Hogsmeade, but we will let that pass.)   These places are linked, both in his past and in his mind, with a loving and loyal boyhood friendship.   

Those memories evidently have more power than I would have dreamed. It is no small thing to create the image of a world, and yet even creating a permanent solid illusion is difficult.  If I am reading your letter correctly, Moiraine Sedai, Peter did not create a solid illusion of the grounds; he duplicated the originals, down to the smallest blade of grass.  To create a place exactly as it is elsewhere--including the life in that place--well. Such spells are known. But they are rarely cast successfully, and the legends say that love of another is always a factor in the spells' success.

For a Death Eater to recall his past, and his past friendships, affectionately, would be strange enough. For a Death Eater to create part of a world for one whom he has deeply wronged--this is a contradiction in terms.  No man, pledged body and soul to evil, could do such a thing. Yet beyond question it has been done.

I, too, have rarely seen men who have submitted to darkness overcome it.  I do not quite know what to say or to think.  It is strange to think of Peter changing so swiftly in a matter of months. Yet I know that Milliways is capable of working wonders on both mind and spirit--if the person in question is willing to change.

Those in the Order who know of Peter's confession--and not all do--tend to be deeply sceptical. Tonks, I think, believes it, and him.  Kingsley Shacklebolt remains noncommittal; I do not know what he thinks or feels, if anything. Molly Weasley is fiercely hostile to Peter, as are most of the Weasleys.  Alastor Moody believes that this is all a vicious trick, something that Peter is doing with the connivance of Voldemort.

And then there is Remus Lupin. The only one of Peter's former friends still living. He has always blamed Peter (more justly than he knew) for James Potter's death and (with less cause, if the confession is to be believed) for Sirius Black's imprisonment.  It is hard for Remus to deal with a repentant and remorseful Peter. I believe he would much prefer to believe that Peter did what he did out of conviction and evil, twisted loyalty to his master; he wants desperately for there to have been a purpose to all this. 

Peter admits to what he has done, but he does not speak of conviction or fanatic loyalty--only of guilt and fear and desperation. This, above all, Remus finds intolerable. I believe that he wants to kill Peter, or would if Peter were here.

Yet Tonks often arrives with questions about Remus. Not the sort I would expect from a spy, either. Simple questions. Is Remus working? Is he eating? How is his health?  Are his transformations getting any better?  Does he need any extra Wolfsbane Potion? 

Foolish questions. So far Remus has declined to answer each one. I cannot forget, however, that of Remus, Sirius and James, Peter admired James the most but described himself as being closest to Remus. Nor can I forget what I heard from Madame Pomfrey, the Hogwarts school nurse: that Peter started helping to patch up his friends' injuries (from pranks and such) when they were no more than twelve.

Peter and I need to talk, I think. And shall, as soon as I can figure out what to say to him.

And may the Light illumine you, Moiraine Sedai, for giving me hope for a man I once feared was lost.

I remain,

Your obedient servant,

Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore
Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</i></lj-cut>"

"event","It has been three days since the rescue party to the Dreaming saved Morpheus. Three days since Peter Pettigrew, Elizabeth Bennet, Will Stanton and Moiraine Sedai returned from walking through the World of Dreams together. 

And Peter is feeling at loose ends.

He is not sure why. The quest is over. It succeeded beyond his wildest imaginings. And he has come back safe and sound to Milliways, which is the same as when he left twelve days ago.

Maybe that's the problem. Milliways is the same--the same influx of people, the same insane crises (the bar, for example, has gone missing for no logical reason), the same questions and demands about how to get out of the bar once you're Bound.

Peter knows that he is different now. Having walked through a lethal labyrinth of terrors, both his own and those of his companions, he is no longer afflicted with the burden of fear he has borne for so long. He can still feel fear, but fears and insecurities have ceased to trouble him as they once did.

Moreover, to overcome those fears--and the group nightmares--he had to choose to overcome much of the weakness and evil in himself. To choose the Light, as Will and Moiriane would say. He still has to deal with the fallout from his earlier actions, but he has changed.

There is no going back now, if there ever was.

Unfortunately, there's no going forward, either. He is still Bound here, though he's checked outside the front door, and the path which he believes leads back to his own world is far clearer than before. He does not know how the investigation started by his confession is going, or if it is going at all; only Tonks would know this, and he is reluctant to ask. He knows how entangled bureaucracies get in red tape, and he honestly doesn't want to make too much of the confession. Besides, Tonks generally hangs around with Crowley, and while Peter admits to liking the demon (much against his better judgement), he has not forgotten that exposure to Crowley's hellspawned power came very close to killing him, damning him, or both.  

He would like to talk to the others. But Will has gone back to his family's farm in Buckinghamshire; Moiraine seems preoccupied; and Liz, alas, does not reside in the bar, but in the House of Arch.  As for Morpheus, he has been busy mending a millions-of-years-old estrangement with his sibling, Desire.

He needs...

He doesn't know what he needs. Something to do. Some challenge to overcome.

"event","Tonight was a disaster.

And it was a disaster because of love.

<lj-cut>Regulus has fallen for Hob Gadling. Why that's bad, I don't know.  But Hob was impossible. Cruel, angry, mocking. I really had to restrain myself to keep from hexing the arsehole into oblivion.

I tried to explain. I spoke about how important it is to grab love with both hands. About how love matters.  But Hob only laughed.

What I couldn't say: I envy you, Hob.

What I also couldn't say: No one ever looked at me that way. 

I'd kill to have someone look at me the way Regulus looks at Hob--all soft and bright-eyed and hopeful, the look of someone who knows what you are deep down, good and bad, and who loves you anyway.

I never had that.

I know that I never will.

Hob telling me that he has loved and has been loved by hundreds of men and women and has lost them all is like Elizabeth Taylor complaining that satin wedding gowns can't be dry-cleaned.

You're complaining because you have had so much love in your life, Hob? How would you live if your mother believed from the time you were seven that you were a servant of the Devil? If only three people ever became close friends--and two became your enemies when the third became your victim? If no woman has ever embraced you without being paid first?

And Hob looks at Regulus' passionate eyes.  And spits in the kid's face. Metaphorically.

Merlin, it drives me crazy.

I tried to make it right between them. I tried.  I have no expertise when it comes to love. I only know what it is like living without love, and I am very, very tired of it.

But Reg said he didn't need a big brother defending him. And Hob just kept telling me to shut up.

And finally, I apologised and left.  Which was a defeat, even if they didn't know it. Love and kindness do not come naturally to me. Paul Morlock and I have more in common than I would like.  We are both whisperers, destroyers of others' mental health and hope.  Both of us have suffered torture that broke something in--where? Our minds? Our souls? Both? We both hate the people who tortured us and made us what we are.

The only difference is that I am still struggling to escape the effects of my version of the Pain Room. Paul has given up. I have a horrible feeling that his response might be the saner one. I have little experience of friendship, and none of love. I am wagering my life and sanity on the possibility that there is actually a Tooth Fairy.

I want to believe there is a Tooth Fairy. And sometimes--as with the look in Regulus' eyes--I catch a glimpse.

But never directed toward me.

And not in my own heart. Not for many years.

If only I could have explained this to Hob. 

If only I could have made him see it.

If only he would have listened.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Peter's Bio"">I was born on the nineteenth of March, 1960, in Birmingham, England, to Albert and Louisa Pettigrew. I was their only son, though not their only child--I had (still do have, actually) three elder sisters: Mildred (born in 1935), Rose (1937) and Judith (1940). I was a surprise baby, born to a man in his mid-forties and a woman not far behind him in age. From comments I have heard over the years, I gather that it was not altogether a pleasant surprise, but they rallied. 

I was named Peter after my paternal grandfather and Joseph because I was born on St Joseph's Day. This last would not have been significant to any of wizarding family, nor to many halfbloods or Muggles, but St Joseph the Worker, Patron of Happy Deaths and Invoked Against Doubt, had great signifcance to my parents, who were both Roman Catholics.  

My father, who was an accountant, was struck by a car and killed when I was four years old.  The funeral and the estate taxes all but bankrupted my mother. Even the pittance that was my father's life insurance policy went to pay bills. My sisters helped, of course, but they had husbands and children of their own to care for, so any aid they gave was sporadic at best.

My mother worked at a number of menial jobs (scrubbing out various shops, for instance) before becoming a baker in a local pie shop. The accountant's-wife-turned-scrubwoman remained a good joke in my neighbourhood long after she had taken the job at the pie shop; one boy at my primary school summed it up with the words: ""Pettigrew's mother takes in stairs to wash.""

At seven, I began showing the first signs of magic. I made books fly to me and footballs (aimed at me with deadly force by bullies) fly around me. Nothing out of the ordinary--but my mother, once she began noticing, didn't agree. She decided that I had to be possessed. 

So began a period during which my mother would haul me off to various Catholic churches--and when those failed to exorcise me, various occultists, spiritualists and frauds. I got quite good at reciting the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary, as these were accepted means of proving that I was not possessed.  Not that that helped much; being young and under considerable stress meant that my magic tended to erupt at odd times--sending things flying across the room, exploding solid glass...things like that.

It drove my mother mad. I do not exaggerate. She was a devout Roman Catholic and everything that I was doing seemed vile and corrupt to her, signs of a pact with the Devil.  She cried frequently, sank in appalling depressions and demanded that I pray, or go to confession. She often begged me to disavow my allegiance with evil--which I learned to disavow, despite not having such allegiance. Doing so saved me countless lectures, punishments and hysterical scenes. And I did not want her upset. She was my mother, after all.

Why the Ministry never came to Obliviate her, I do not know.

In any case, I spent four years being punished for magic, both at home and at school, that I could not control and could not cut out of me. This changed on my eleventh birthday, when Professor McGonagall came to visit our flat.  She explained to my mother that I had won a full, seven-year, all-expenses-paid scholarship to an extremely exclusive public school dedicated to the very highest moral standards.  She strongly implied, though she never said, that the school was Roman Catholic.

My mother was thrilled. I was considerably less so, until Professor McGonagall took me aside and told me privately that I had been born a wizard and that I was not evil by nature at all.

I've tried to hang on to that assurance over the years.

My introduction to Hogwarts was typical--Hogwarts Express, boats across the lake, Sorting Hat. The Hat hesitated a moment before putting me in Gryffindor; it said I might make a good Hufflepuff.  I objected, not because I knew anything about the houses, but because the word ""Gryffindor"" sounded better.

I was happier in Gryffindor than I'd ever been in my entire life, and quickly became friends with three wonderfully insane chaps in my year: James Potter, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. 

About James. There is a contingent that says that I desired him sexually.  The truth is more complicated.

I never desired him; I was and am heterosexual. But I did love him, yes. Part of it was fear (for James could be cuttingly cruel when he wanted to be), part of it envy (for James was the epitome of what I wished to be--tall, handsome, athletic, brilliant and rich).  But mostly it was because of what James was. He breathed goodness; he exuded decency. 

This is not to say that he (and the rest of us) could not be utter prats, particularly where Severus Snape was concerned. But--when he was not showing off--he was kind. His first thought when we learned about Remus Lupin was, ""Poor devil. That's not fair. Wish we could do something to make his life easier."" He tried to understand people.  He brightened the world (or at least Gryffindor Tower) with his enthusiasm. And it was James who ran to drag Snape away from the jaws of a werewolf, risking his own life and humanity in the process.

I was not his best friend--Sirius was. But I would have done anything to make James happy.

So yes, I loved him.  Merlin help me, I still do.

The four of us remained friends after leaving school. We were all working for the Order of the Phoenix, though we were also labouring at more prosaic jobs.  I was working in the Experimental Charms Division of the Ministry of Magic, dating a young halfblood witch, formerly of Hufflepuff, and enjoying my life immensely.

Then came James and Lily's wedding. 21 December 1979.  James chose the date because that date has the shortest day of the year--and the longest night. 

I remember the date well. I was captured after I left the wedding. And I was brought to Voldemort.

Voldemort wanted a spy in the Order. I don't think he picked me, particularly. I think that he was testing every Order member that he could get his hands on. 

My memories of that time are blurred.  Repeated doses of Crucio will do that. So will Carna Corruptis, which rots the flesh from your bones in a matter of hours, and Terantis, which transforms you into a monster that still bears a grotesque resemblance to yourself. And Voldemort, raping my mind over and over again. I think that the only reason that I am still sane is because my memories ARE blurred.

Let me say right now--the Imperius Curse had nothing to do with why I turned.  I could claim that it did, but it wouldn't be true.

No. Voldemort broke me. He broke me by alternating physical pain, mental anguish, and relief.  He described in loving and gruesome detail what he would do to James, Sirius, Remus, Lily and my mother, should I refuse. I have no doubt that he was telling the truth; Voldemort, even then, was wholly unused to being refused.

At last, I gave in. The pain, the mindrape and the terror were too much. I agreed to what he wanted, thinking that I could surely control what I said about the Order.

How it must have amused him to realise that his latest toy had some notion of autonomy.

I did try. I tried to leak only insignificant information. I did my  best to place a few innocents--such as little Dora Tonks, whom my friends and I had babysat when she was younger--under my protection as a Death Eater.  (How that galled dear Bellatrix--a Mudblood guarding a halfblood freak, as she put it.  She was all for skinning Dora alive, and making her parents watch.)

And so it went, until the Potters made me their secret keeper.

A fact he plucked from my mind with Legilimens.

He misliked my reluctance to talk of this, probed, and discovered my fondness for James.  He did not stop questioning and mentally probing me until he had wrung me dry.

He had me guarded for a week to make sure that I could send no warning to the Potters. Then, that Halloween, he  took me with him.

He didn't need to. He knew the address, and had it written down. But he wanted me to see the results of my betrayal.

And, I discovered when we arrived, he wanted me to kill James. He simply handed me his wand, and ordered me to make it painful.

I don't think I'll ever forget James staring at me in shock and disbelief. 

I did not make it painful. I made it quick and painless--one Avada Kedavra, no more. And if I whispered a plea for forgiveness as I murdered my closest friend, that is surely no one's business but my own.

I don't regret the Muggles who died in the explosion I caused in Muggle London later. I suppose I should, but I don't.  I do regret owling Cornelius Fudge and telling him where Sirius was. I knew Sirius would find me; he is a dog Animagus, after all. I assumed that he smelled my scent at the Potters and would be after me. Whether or not he scented me, find me he did--with Fudge and twenty hit wizards close behind. I screamed out a sentence or two of blame, blew open the sewer (deliberately blowing off a finger in the process) and transformed into a rat.

For this, they gave me the Order of Merlin, First Class and gave it to my mother. When she  looked at it, she saw a Muggle medal--the St George Cross.

I really never expected Sirius to be arrested, much less thrown in gaol without a trial. I expected him to be detained for an hour or two at best, giving me enough time to escape. I never intended him to spend twelve years in Azkaban. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. 

All right.  On Voldemort, yes.  But no one else.

I spent the next twelve years as a rat, mostly as Percy's and then Ron's pet. I don't know why I stayed with them so long.  The twins alone were enough to shatter my nerves.

Then there came all that business with the Shrieking Shack. Without making any excuses for my past behaviour--I did what I did freely, or as freely as any Death Eater can act--I'd like to point out that I begged for mercy.

Which implies, doesn't it, that I believe that mercy exists, and should be shown in some cases?

Go on. Find another Death Eater expressing that view. 

After the Shack, I sought out the Dark Lord again.  I think I had some vague notion of turning myself in rather than wait for the few unimprisoned Death Eaters to torture me to death for setting up the situation that led to the disembodiment of the Dark Lord. I'm not sure why I did this--I was certain that he would kill me. Or maybe that was the reason. I don't know. 

At this point, I'm high in his favour. Cutting your own hand off to re-embody your master goes a long way to proving your loyalty to his cause.

Which does not mean that the Dark Lord likes or trusts me. Oh, no. Not at all.

<b>What Peter doesn't want to mention:</b>

Peter's looks are unprepossessing.  He's short (about 5'7"") and scrawny, with watery blue-grey eyes and greying, thinning blond hair which is rapidly falling out. He looks closer to fifty than to his actual thirty-six years. His one distinguishing feature is his silver hand, which he generally hides under  gloves.

He has a fear/hatred of cats and dogs that would amount to a phobia if he were not, occasionally, a rat, and therefore legitimate prey of both.

Peter is not welcomed by his fellow Death Eaters, due to his Mudblood status and his being a rat Animagus, and is very much aware of not belonging. He believes that he would get on them better were he more attractive, either as a human or as an animal.  Much will be forgiven you, he thinks, if you've had the foresight to be comely. 

He's created the persona of Wormtail, the fanatically loyal Death Eater, to enable him to function within the organisation.  He tries to keep Wormtail and Peter separate and distinct personalities.

Peter's old wand was poplar with a dragon heartstring core. Poplar is associated with endurance, shielding and protection, speech and conquest. That works well in view of Peter's talent for survival, his being the Secret-Keeper who was supposed to shield and protect James and Lily, his divisive words which convinced James, Sirius and Lily that Remus was the traitor, and his being ""conquered"" by Voldemort.

Peter's new wand is blackthorn with a phoenix tailfeather. Blackthorn is associated with dark magic, as well as fate, and strong influences that cannot be resisted. And the phoenix is, of course, a symbol of transformation, resurrection, rebirth and hope--fitting for the Animagus wizard presumed dead for so many years and who owes a debt to the prophesied saviour of the wizarding world.

Peter is cautious, obsequeious, cowardly and a bit of a suck-up. He's also very intelligent, well-read, and surprisingly powerful in that many of his magical abilities don't require the use of a wand--the results of the twelve years he spent (mostly) as a rat. He deeply regrets what happened to James and Lily, and wishes he could change what happened--even if it meant his own death.  He still misses James and thinks of him frequently. 

And he feels he owes Harry far, far more than he can ever repay.</lj-cut>"

Its been a while this time and right now im bored as hell so i think i will. So anyways today was wednesday my second favorite day of the week because we get out an hour earlier. The bells were a little weird but not as bad as before cus i was like really confused last time. Today, just bells 6 and 7 were switched. In computer we did this like computer game from like 1992 about probability and stuff so that was easy. Science was boring because all we did was turn crap in and watch her play science related games on her computer. Language arts we had a sub and that was boring. then algebra... not much. then lunch with Hannah which was interesting becaus her and like 3 othe gurls were having like this major laugh attack the whole time. But then they stopped when it was ""social time"". And then now i dont want to write anymore crap in this thing so now im going to go and work on my band and general music buddy icon website.

I Love Hannah!

Bye"

ok so im going to start off by sying that today blowed! so i got home from spening the night at haggertys house because he had guitar then he was going to pick me back up ar something so that we could do something. but my parents decide to make me finish my book report bfore i did anything. so i did that and then it like got really icy out on the roads so haggerty couldnt pick me up. Then we try to plan a movie with a bunch of people but we didnt have a ride because all of our parent are fat and lazy and they didnt want to get off of their asses and take us to a friggen movie. JESUS GOD!!!!!! Im so mad! and to round all of my sucky day up, hannahs best friend sammie, her boyfriend friggen played her like a 5 year old child would play with his McDonalds toy for a week then drop it off and leave it in the dust somewhere. He told her that she only made him realze that he only likes half of the things about her. MAXWELL YOURE A FUCKING IDIOT TO LEAVE SOMEONE AS GREAT AS SAMMIE. I was tlking to hannah and she said she is at her house laying on her bed scared and shaking. Sucks.

Bye"

I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out"

So anyways i woke up at like 10:15 and my mom called and was like ok since youre staying home today you have to do all of your homework and know all of you Social Studies vocab word definitions. So i was like half awake like yeah whatever mom. Then she was like no Im serious. So like Ive been studying and typing out my book report for Language Arts for like 2 fricken hours. Now that i think about it i prolly should have not been lazy and turned my ski form thing in. So now that im done with my project and i dont feel like studying my S.S. words. Im going to go upstairs and watch some t.v. then read some of my new LA book so that Im like ahead. I have the whole Fricken day today to do something with Hannah since she stayed hame too and my mom had to be gay and say no. So Im not very happy with my mother today.

Um yeah so today was wednesday which means that we had a short day. So computer applications class was retarded and boring. Science seemed really short (i was ontime today) we had to make these like rocker launcher things out of toilet paper rolls, rubber bands, and straws. it was pretty boring! L.A. sucked cus i forgot to do my freaking homework so like me and tony burnett, jordy b, david, and i think thats it had to go out in the hall for two fricken whole bells to read a book and answer like 25 questions on it. So then after that i went to math which was like not boring and not fun. We played jeopardy with alegebra questions and crud. Then i went to lunch with Hannah and some other peeps. So that was like fershizzle awesome. Then it was off to Social Studies... bleh! But i did my homework! :-D Percussion clas was boring today... Mr Maegly like played notes on the fricken merimba (or h/e you spell it) and we had to like number a peice of paper 1-15 and guess w/o looking at what he was playing what note it was and write it down so, yeah, that was fer~shizz~izzle boring >>>Fer~shizz~izzle<<< that is soooo my word! Then i rode the bus home. I HATE THE BUS! It really really sucks that my brother is a senior cus now he gets out 1 hour earlier than me and cant drive me home! :-( Anyways so that was my day and now i have no homework or atleast i dont think i do ............... Nope no Homework ..................... so now im here in front of my computer bing really bored, eating chips and some AWESOME salsa that my gma made when she was here and drinkin mountain dew!"

Well today was really sucked! One reason is because I late for science. And i have never ever been late for science. The reason I was late was because I had to pee like REALLY REALLY bad. Haha. Well anyways so i walked into science clas and Mrs. Huber was like ""MR.BAIRD!"" (long pause) ""Why are you late?"" so i told her the truth because you know... i never lie ;-)... i sad i was in the bathroom so she like gives me this huge, nasty stare. And then she just kinda gave me a demerit and forgot about it. But im no too worried about it. So like my day got better every time i saw Hannah in the hallway. Oh tommorow is wednesday i get to have lunch with her! :-D I have like a little bit of homework so im going to do that then prolly drum  and/or watch the televisorationer. <-- that means tv i like to say it like that. hehe

I Love You Hannah

Goodbye!"

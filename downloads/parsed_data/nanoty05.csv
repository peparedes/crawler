"event","Though I've known about <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org"">NaNoWriMo</a> for a few years now, (thanks to <lj user=""mehrvigne"">), I have yet to participate in this writing challenge of olympic proportions.  And frankly, after struggling through the monotony of a strict school/work routine for a year, I'm glad to have found something I hope will help me break from the schedule and add a little ""flavor"" to my mundane life.  And if nothing else, it gives me an excuse to spend mindless hours wasting away on the computer, which is always a good thing.

For the most part I plan to use this space as a sort of ""desktop"" for my pre-writing phase.  I've got a lot of outlining and character development to work on, and this is most likely where I'll jumble together any brainstorming.  HOWEVER, come November 30th, should I be lucky enough to have endured the challenge and accomplish writing my 50,000+ words, I'll be sure to post my work for all to read or comment upon.

Will NaNoWriMo 2005 be the single event to send me off the edge?  I guess we'll simply have to wait and see..."

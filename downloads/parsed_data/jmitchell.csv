"event","First semester over... I'll probably update more on this later.  However, tonight, I leave you with a quote:

obfuscated SN: what's the theme [for the vareity show at Buford] for this year?
AmayaSumi04: seasons.
AmayaSumi04: life/weather
AmayaSumi04: good one
AmayaSumi04: funny to see how he will tie life and weathe rtogether
obfuscated SN: isn't it obvious?
AmayaSumi04: sorta
AmayaSumi04: but like not fully.
obfuscated SN: lightning was probably a catalyst in the creation of life on earth circa 3.5 billion years ago
AmayaSumi04: lmao
AmayaSumi04: justin.
AmayaSumi04: no one n the audience is tha  nerdy

"event","One final down, two to go - heck yes, school is almost over.  The last few days have been of the more interesting variety, primarily spent disassembling my laptop to remove the soda I spilled on it, studying for finals, and more thought on social dilemmas.  People are quite an interesting species; unmatched not only in intellect and genius, but also in our sheer illogical thought processes.  Our brains are but neurons and chemicals, and yet from a self-organized network of connections comes the most amazing computer ever known.  Of course, Descartes would disagree with the last statement, as will a significant portion of my readership.  Ah well, good topic for discussion, I suppose.

With the many situations developing in my life recently, Christmas break should be an interesting diversion from the monotony of normal life.  Given the sensitive nature of most of the situations, I suppose I will abstain from writing on it all now.  I also am doing a major project for ICS, integrating a few servers and attempting to create a working prototype of our final product.  Finally, given the multitude of friends I've promised to visit over the break, I imagine I'll manage to stay busy, even without school.

In conclusion, I recommend everyone goes out and reads ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" right now.  Nikkie recommended the book to me, and I must say it's quite a nice read.  It's very short and to the point (I managed to read it in about an hour over her house), but everyone can learn something about dealing with change from it."

"event","Today is mine and Justin's six month anniversary! I'm so happy that we've made it this long, through all the hard times that we've had. He's stuck with me through many times that I was surprised that he even wanted to stay with me for. He's been more faithful to me than anyone in the past has ever been to me. He never lets me doubt that he loves me. He never lets me lose my confidence in myself. He keeps me accountable. He and I are able to pray together in order to keep our relationship with God as a part of our relationship. We're able to talk about spiritual things and try to see each other's views on them. We are so similar in many ways, but are also so different that it makes our relationship interesting. He takes care of me. He gives me everything that I could have wanted in a relationship. I'm so thankful that God put us together, my life has been truly blessed by Justin.

We're not able to be together today, which makes this anniversary a little more sad than the others. Six months is a big deal to both of us and I wish that I could see him, but I know I can't. We'll just see each other all weekend (as we normally do) and celebrate our anniversary then. 

I would have never seen myself dating Justin when we first met! We were so different that I thought of him as just some random guy that I was in a band with. After I had been in the band for a while, he and I started talking online and becoming friends. Pretty soon, he was one of my good friends and a person that I could confide in about a lot of things. At the end of April was when things started to change (for those of you who read LiveJournal at that time, you know what I'm talking about because I know some of you read the entries that we wrote while he was at my house). I started seeing him differently, as someone that maybe I could see myself with. We had our first date on May 2 after talking about the feelings we were starting to have for each other. I became his girlfriend on May 18th and that was one of the best decisions I've made this year! I was afraid that we would break up when we left for college, but that didn't happen. We're now closer than we were before we left for college and our relationship just keeps getting stronger everyday. I didn't know at first why God was putting Justin in my life, but now I realize that He did it to show me what love really is and how a relationship should work.

I really do love him so much and I'm so glad that he's in my life. I love you, my geek :-*  Happy six month!"

"event","Today is the six month anniversary of when Katie and I became boyfriend and girlfriend.  Though I suppose to some people, this means nothing, I must say it marks the best six months of my life thus far, and therefore it's meaningful to me.  Katie has always been there for me, being one of the nicest, sweetest people I know.  She's also let me be there for her, opening up to me about everything; trusting completely, just as a relationship should be.  I wish it were possible to see her today, even if I could just have taken her out to dinner.  She deserves more than a dinner on this occasion, but the closest she'll get to seeing me today is through a webcam.

I'm truly blessed in so many ways.  I'm blessed to have the best girlfriend in the world (yeah, yeah, I know everyone says that... but mine really is ;)).  I'm blessed to have found someone so kind and loving.  I'm blessed to be in a stable relationship; not void of disagreements, but lacking the uncertainty that plagues so many people our age.  I'm blessed to have found someone who generally shares my beliefs on God and religion (except for women pastors and predestination... *cough*).  Most of all, I'm blessed to love someone that reciprocates that love.

Happy six months, my love :-*"

"event","Since Justin and I apparently never update, I'll update to prove that statement wrong ;) Justin has been crazy busy lately, like me, with school and other such things. He and I have been lucky enough to be able to see each other every weekend since I've been away at college (the only one we didn't get to see each other was the one where he moved into Tech and I was getting ready to move into NGCSU, but that's the only one other than that). I didn't think that we were going to be able to see each other but once every two weeks and Justin told me that he thought we'd see each other more than that... I'll admit it, I was wrong and he was right... thank goodness he was right! I think that the old saying is true... ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder."" I really believe that, the distance doesn't make me love him any less, if anything it makes me even more grateful for the time that we get to spend together. He's such a blessing in my life and I'm glad he's such a big part of my life. He and I get to talk a couple of times a day on the phone, send each other text messages all day long, talk online, and he talks to me every night before I go to bed. Even though we don't get to see each other every day like we pretty much did this summer, we're in constant communication during the weekdays. 
      I'll update about what we did this weekend because I don't think I can really remember all the places we've been since we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") updated his journal last. Yesterday, we went to The Varsity for dinner and then to Tech for a while. It was great being able to just talk to him and see him. He picked me some flowers too, which was just an adorable thing to do :) Then he and I came back to my house and he stayed here for a while before he had to go home. Today, he came to my house and we stayed here for a while this afternoon, where I proceeded to make him watch Gilmore Girls in agreement that I would watch two episodes of one of his favorite shows for making him suffer like he says that I did. Oh, today was our five month anniversary, which is so nice! I'm glad that we're making it, even though we have distance between us for most of the week... on the weekends we're inseparable :) Anyway, so we left my house and went to Applebee's on the way to Steph's grandma's house to celebrate Steph's 19th birthday. We decided not to eat until after the party so we went shoe shopping for me so I could have some brown shoes to take back to NGCSU with me since it's getting cold. He was a little annoyed because I found some shoes I liked but went to three other shoes before coming back 45 minutes later to the first pair I saw and buying them ;) He got over his initial bitterness once we arrived at the birthday party after taking a few wrong turns (::ahem:: I told him the right way to go but he didn't think it was and it turned out to be right ::ahem::). We stayed for a while before going to City Cafe Diner, where we were the only people in the place for a while which was creepy. Then we went to Conyers to get a Blockbuster rental card for the two of us, since we always watch movies on the weekend and we're running out of stuff to watch! The guy who helped us get the card was really funny and made fun of Justin's lack of handwriting skills, for all who care. I was rolling for about ten minutes while he was filling out the paperwork and making fun of Justin's penmanship (apparently, Justin was born in 1705 instead of 1985). Then we came back here before he had to leave and meet his friend. Tomorrow should be fun... he's coming to pick me up and take me back to NGCSU because my BSU is doing something for Gold Rush Days and I have to be there and wanted Justin there.
      Well, to end off this loverly (yes I spelled it wrong on purpose) entry, I will now include a little sappy stuff that nobody wants to read! I figured that I would save it for the end so nobody that didn't want to would be forced to read it ;) I'm so glad that God put Justin in my life. Justin said the sweetest thing tonight... he was praying for our meal and thanked God for putting us together. Then he told me after he prayed that it was God that put us together because I wasn't the type of girl that he'd normally date. Yes, that may seem odd to someone and not so sweet to others, but it was sweet to me. It made me feel good that he was acknowledging that God had put us together and that there's a reason for us being together. He's been a big blessing in my life and I'm thankful for him daily. He's my boyfriend and my best friend. I know he'll do anything for me and I'll do anything for him. I'm looking forward to seeing what God has in store for us, I think it's something great. I'm just trusting God with what he wants for me and Justin :) So... Justin, I love you more than anything in the whole wide world and I'm grateful for you, geek :-*"

"event","Since Justin never updates, I'll step in once again and do the job for him so you can all be informed as to what's going on in Justin's life. On Friday night he went to Six Flags and had a good time there. He told me all about it when he called me and woke me up at 1 AM when he got home ;) It was ok for him to do that though because I told him he could. On Saturday he came to pick me up early (by early I mean 10 which is early for a Saturday morning) so we could go to the Yellow Daisy Festival. We stopped to get gas and got him breakfast at Chick-fil-a on the way to the park. Traffic was horrendous as expected, we didn't really leave at an early enough time but that wasn't my fault (::ahem:: Justin's fault, but I didn't say that!). The Yellow Daisy Festival was actually really nice. We walked in and Justin said that he'd never felt more out of place somewhere just because of the crowd and the environment. Basically, it was crafty (and some cool artsy stuff thank you very much)and... we were a weird age, older than the kids who's parents dragged but younger than the parents who wanted to come... so we were the only teenagers there of their own free will (well I was there out of my own free will and Justin claims that I dragged him there which is somewhat accurate). It was still fun though and I know he had a good time after he got used to it. It was so nice and relaxing, we just walked around the festival with our arms around each other, enjoying each other's company. It was really sweet... and he bought me a blue ring there which is pretty and I've worn it everyday since then... he's sweet to me :) We went to Blimpie's after that for lunch before we headed to Tech. Wow, Tech. That was pure insanity right there. All the fans there for the Tech/Auburn game were insane! It was madness! Have I emphasized enough that it was pretty crazy? Well, Tech won which was awesome and that excited me... and Justin obviously. The only bad thing about Saturday was the fact that he found out that something happened the night before, I'll let him update about that if he cares to. Since he was unhappy about his unfortunate revelation, we went to The Varsity and I bought his dinner :) I like being able to do stuff like that! Then he and I went back to my house and watched the old Music Man again because it's so good. We finished watching the rest of it yesterday, but that's coming up later. On Sunday he came to Logan's Roadhouse to pick me up after I got finished with eating lunch with my family and a church friend. He and I went shopping after that for a cable to put on laptop's so they won't get stolen (I still can't figure out how to put mine on but oh well). I then dragged him to Old Navy to get me a new purse since mine broke. He was very patient with me and I appreciated that :) We went back to my house after that and finished watching the Music Man. Butch's parents came over for a while so we talked to them before packing his car with my stuff. He and I got all my stuff in his car and we started driving to Lauren's house so she could take me back up here. He and I went to eat dinner, then we went to Lauren's house. He stayed until we had to leave. It gets harder and harder for me to leave him every time. Seeing him drive off right before we did was really hard, I don't know why it gets so difficult sometimes. I wish that I were closer to him sometimes, but I realize that God has us apart right now for a reason. And I treasure the time we do get to spend together when we see each other so that makes those rare times more special. I miss him today and I love him :)"

"event","Quite a bit has happened since my last post, most of which will never find its way into the hallowed halls of <em>The Live Journal</em>.  My first week of classes ended well, with little (or, more exactly, no) trouble at all.  In fact, I've already completed all homework due until Friday (I'm such a nerd).  Political Science is still great, and English/CS/Calc are there.  I missd PSYC 1000 yesterday... thought it was at 2, turns out it was at 1.  When I arrived, I found myself at the mercy of a class full of management majors... scary stuff ;)

Anyway, Katie came to visit on Sunday, which was incredibly nice.  She already updateded about that in here though, so I'll just leave it at that."

"event","I know that I have my own journal, but I still wanted to make a quick update on Justin's :) I had forgotten how fun it was to take over his journal to make an entry! So anyway, I was able to see Justin on Sunday. He picked me up at a gas station where my family met him after driving me all the way to Tucker from Dahlonega. When I saw his car pull up in the parking lot, all I could do was smile and scramble to get out of the car. If you haven't seen someone that means that much to you in ten days, you get very excited about it :) I didn't think I would be able to see him until this weekend but it worked out for me to see him last weekend too! He and I went to Tech where he showed me around campus some before we went to eat at the Student Center. He showed me around the campus some more and we just stayed there for a while. Spending time with him was so nice and much needed. He and I stopped to get some food on the way home to take back to my house. He and I ate while watching Chicago... good movie. Then we went to visit my grandma (Nanu) for a few minutes before coming back to my house. He had to leave pretty soon after we got back to my house and I didn't like that one bit. I think it gets harder and harder for me to have him leave each time he does it. I feel like seeing him on Sunday made our relationship even stronger. Just some of the stuff we talked about made me trust him even more than I already do and made me realize how strong our relationship is. 

I get to see him in two days :) I'm coming home for Labor Day weekend and I get to see him on Friday, Saturday, and possibly another day in there somewhere! I can't wait. Yes I just saw him a few days ago, but I still want to see him again and am just as excited as I was the last time to see him :) He's the greatest and I'm thankful for my best friend/boyfriend that I miss and love :) I love doing sappy things like that every once in a while!"

"event","ah, now I remember what ""study music"" is :)  Though, to be truthful, I've really not had much studying thus far.  I went to my first CS class yesterday, since I skipped my lecture/recitation earlier in the week.  I was so completely bored I ended up creating some artwork... I'll try to scan it in and put it on here sometime.  Calc is still dumb, but I'm sure it'll get more interesting sometime.  Ah, oh well... so far, POLS 1101 is my favorite class.  How sad, a math major preferring a humanities class (note: I still like math and computers more, the classes are just extremely boring).

I get to see Katie on Sunday... I can't wait :)  I haven't seen her for over a week, the most since she went to Alaska.  Then I get to see her over Labor Day weekend too... that should all be good.  I'll be able to hang out with some old friends tonight at the final On The Bricks, featuring the Goo Goo Dolls.  Ahh... good times."

"event","Here I am again, 3:42 in the morning, though this time I graced the Student Center with my presence.  Needless to say, all the sane people have been sleeping for hours, whilst I finished all my homework assignments from today.  In addition to this, I finished the first phase of a project for ICS tonight, which mostly consisted of shuffling data amongst several spreadsheets.  In theory, I'll finish a Gantt chart tomorrow, which will represent inventory at a warehouse in DC for a certain well-known-but-I'm-not-sure-I-should-write-it-here retail chain.  Ah well...

Classes went well yesterday.  My college career commenced with a 12:00 lecture in Political Science 1101.  The class should be fairly entertaining, and the teacher won bonus points for mocking both major political parties within 15 minutes.  In the class, we will set up our own congress, and each person will create a bill and attempt to get it passed.  We must also write an argumentative essay, roughly in the style of an editorial, on some topic (preferably it should be arguing for your bill to get passed).

English lasted all of 15 minutes today, with our only assignment to create a WebX account and read a little 16-page something.  The theme for the class is nuclear arms... heck yeah... this is my kinda english :)

Calc was... Algebra.  We reviewed inequalities mostly.  We should be dealing with calculus by next week, though.  I just finished my 30-or-so math problems that were assigned as homework.  For some reason, I'm strangely motivated to do schoolwork here, something I've never quite felt before.  Perhaps it's the constant reminding that ""Tech is harder than High School"", but I think it's something more than that.  I think the environment itself fosters a sense of learning and a desire to succeed.  My High School studying consisted primarily of grabbing a bite at Chick-Fil-A before a test, and maybe skimming through the book... depending on how much I was in the mood for CFA.  Ah well, 'tis all for the better I suppose.

In slightly less academic news, Katie and I have been dating for three months as of yesterday.  I miss her, but realize it's only temporary and that I will see her eventually, though it'd certainly have been nice to see her yesterday.  I become more convinced every day that it wasn't a mistake to stay together in college.  She starts classes today... I'm quite positive she'll do fine (I mean, she has to be smarter than the military guys... and she probably is smarter than most of the girls there too).  I keep meeting new people here at Tech as well, which adds a nice break from studies.  Just tonight, I finally met someone with whom I've spoken for quite some time.  I keep attempting not to shun my old friends, though it's quite difficult at times.  I'll probably try to get a lot of us together this Friday to go see the Goo Goo Dolls down at On The Bricks.

Anyway... I ought to get some rest before my 1:00 class tomorrow (oh yeah, my schedule rocks).  CS starts tomorrow night as well, which should prove interesting.  Anyway... g'morning all."

"event","As I figured, I haven't been able to update as frequently as my pre-college years.  I'm presently in the Library West Commons at 3:16 in the morning, primarily to avoid waking my roommate with my nocturnal patterns.  I shant bore you with the mundane details of my day, as there were merely a few highlights worthy of mention.

First, I stopped by a fraternity today... not just any frat, but a Jewish frat :)  Amazingly, I finally met another discrete math major there, and we talked for about an hour.  We played Egyptian Ratscrew/Chinese Whore (depending on whom you ask) again, and I actually set up an excel spreadsheet to keep track of winnings throughout the semester.

Through the hustle and bustle of the season, I've managed to make a few personal contacts... I'm rather surprised at my level of social interaction over the last few days.  Mind you, I have done more than merely partying... I've actually gone through a bit of CS and Calc, and managed to procure all my books for the semester, aside from English.

Tomorrow (today, I suppose) marks my first day of classes... it's strange, but I cannot say I feel homesick in the least.  In fact, I'm inclined to say I feel more at home here than anywhere else.  The one major detraction of Tech is that Katie isn't here.  She moved in to N Ga today, and ended up having a fine time (I told her there was nothing to worry about).  In fact, that's probably the only thing I could complain about here, the lack of Katie.  We talked on the phone tonight, where I found out some, ahem, interesting activities they have planned for tomorrow.  Ah well, I trust her... if there's no trust, there's really no relationship.  Especially when she's an hour away, and I have no way of really knowing what she's doing other than what she says.

Stuart also called me tonight, needing something done by tomorrow.  Splendid... I spent an hour or two earlier this morning figuring out Gantt charts in Excel.  He's suppose to email me sometime this morning, detailing some preliminary work for me, and then call at 10:00, to discuss putting the data in presentable form for the execs.

Anyway... classes start in 8.5 hours.  Wish me luck."

"event","well, I finally moved in to the dorm here at Tech.  I don't expect to update as much or in as much detail, probably just when something interesting or notable happens.  Some general observations so far are that most guys here are desperate, and make themselves look like fools chasing girls, and that the buzz card is awesome.  I'll be getting lots of excersize here, even if I never set foot in the SAC.  Anyway, Katie got an LJ tonight too... <a href=""http://livejournal.com/users/mykatiebug/"">mykatiebug</a>.  

I must say, I absolutely love it here at Tech, though.  Despite the dominate Y chromosome, the people here are really friendly and intelligent.  My roommate is a fairly quiet guy, I don't think he'll give me any problems (nor I him, I hope).  I've met quite a few friends, so I'm not terribly isolated here.  My dorm is larger than I expected, not crowded at all, in fact... I could put my couch in here quite comfortably.  The only part I don't like about Tech is being away from Katie; I can't wait to see her in a few weeks.  I took seeing her all the time for granted this summer, and now I won't much at all.  But at least life here is great... Tech is really a perfect fit for me."

"event","Geek... I know I know, that's an odd term of affection for someone... but mine is Bug so what else would you expect but something equally weird? Justin just left a few minutes ago, it gets harder and harder to see him go. Now I realize that sounds weird and sappy but let me explain myself :) Justin moves into Tech on Thursday and I move into NGCSU on Sunday. He and I don't get to see each other for a couple of weeks after Wednesday. So that's why it gets harder for me to watch him go because I know that I'll only see him one or two more times before we don't see each other for a couple of weeks. Enough of the sappiness... onto details of stuff that's been going on that might actually interest someone :) I have officially seen Justin for the past four days straight... it's been nice. He came to my house on Thursday and we went to Wendy's before practicing for tonight. He, Jason, Corey, and I were playing at Tucker First Baptist tonight. More on that later ;) So we ate supper then went to the church as the church band had practice before us. As Justin was running sound, I was kept entertained by this precious little girl that was there... I mean, this kid was so cute! Anyway, so practice went well then Jason, Justin, and I went to get a quick bite to eat (I'm always hungry) before my family came to get me. Friday, Justin came over and he and I watched Fools Rush In because my friend Ashley left the movie at my house. Then he and I went to eat before heading to his house to pick Jason up. When we got Jason, we went to On The Bricks to see Tonic and Hootie and the Blowfish. Tonic was really really good... and of course Hootie was great (I love them!)! He and I went to Waffle House with Clay, Jason, and Dustin to eat after the concert (as I said before, I'm always hungry) which was nice. Then I went home :) Yesterday, Justin came over and we went to practice again at TFBC. Practice didn't go very well, to say the least. We went out to dinner with Jason, Dustin, and Rachel. After dinner, we went to a video store and rented Heartbreakers. I know that's a random movie and a few years old, but it's so funny. I was glad that they liked it because I hate recommending movies that people just wind up disliking! Then Jason took Rachel home and Dustin went home... Justin left later after he and I talked for a while. Today was church and lunch at different places for both of us... then we met up at the church. After setting up and practicing, we did the show. That went pretty well, for being thrown together in just two days. Justin, Rachel, Dustin, Jason, and I went to dinner after the concert. Justin and I came back here and watched a movie. Then he and I sat in the computer room and just talked. It was so nice, he and I are getting closer and closer to each other. He truly is my best friend and I do love him. I know that's sappy and nobody probably cares but him, but I do love him. I'm thankful for him daily. Well, I hope I get to update his journal before we both leave for college. If not, I'll talk to you LiveJournal folk in a few weeks or so :)"

"event","My relatives left tonight, after 5 days of visiting.  It's always enjoyable to spend time with them, never a dull moment.  Saturday, we ate Thai (yes, even I sampled some shrimp and some weird sauce... I was pleasantly suprised that I enjoyed it), and then came back to the house to play Blurt.

Sunday, we drove out to Montgomery to see cousin Becky at Maxwell AFB.  Never been on a military base before, it was quite interesting.  What was really cool was seeing her get saluted by the guard as we entered... she's been in the Air Force 3 weeks and is already a 2ed Lieutenant.  I guess they treat doctors well :)  Anyway, I drove almost the entire way there, and the entire way back... about 300 miles.

Today, I mostly researched stock Options, and how to trade them.  I think I will start investing in that, just to see what I can do.  Anyway, my cousins came over for the final dinner tonight, then we played Blurt again.  They drive back to New York tomorrow... anyway, that's all.  G'night."

"event","'tis the title of my vocal performance in my final Mustard Seed show last night (a rare combination of Hendrix's Purple Haze, and the lyrics to Amazing Grace).  The entire story, however, really begins a long long time ago (that would be Thursday), far far away (approximately 5 miles), in a little section of town built around Euclid and Moreland, generally referred to as ""Little 5 Points"".  This section of the city caters to, shall we say, a very ""interesting"" group of people - not exactly my customary hangout.  My relatives from New York happen to be in town, so cousin Sarah, Jason, and I trek the 10 minute drive down to Little 5 Points, walk around, venture into several stores, merely to discover the pricing to be detestable.  Following that, the three of us journeyed Starbucks, and then the Salvation Army off Marietta St.  There, I purchased a shirt for the concert for $2.99... God bless the Salvation Army.  We ate at Felini's, and then went back to my house to futilely attempt to coerce Jason and Mom into watching <em>Run, Lola, Run</em>, a German flick representing three possible outcomes of a certain 20-minute timespan (note: Sarah and I had previously seen it).

Katie and I met up early on Friday, and spent most of the day together.  At her house, I had the distinct ""pleasure"" of viewing <em>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</em>.  Aside from <em>Dude, Where's My Car</em>, I don't believe such a loathsome work of film exists.  The only remotely humorous parts involved mispronunciations of historical figures, but, alas, a movie can only use that so many times.  Perhaps the most annoying quality was the characteristic ""dude-speak""... again, how frequently can the same idiosyncrasy be used and still have comedic value?

We (by which I mean Katie and me) arrived at Faith Community Church in Grayson (the venue for this particular performance) at approximately 6:00, 1.5 hours preceeding the opening song.  I personally think the show went well, though various band members have differing opinions.  Katie was outstanding, particularly in the songs with just her and me.  I did fairly well, with room for improvement... but Amazing Haze and I'm So Afraid (my main two songs) were excellent, I think.  Anyway, Dustin was kind enough to tape the show on my camera, so I've posted some of the better songs on my website at <a href=""http://caffeinehigh.net/narf/FaithCommunity/"">http://caffeinehigh.net/narf/FaithCommunity/</a>.

The interaction on stage was good too, especially between Katie and me (imagine that... almost like we enjoyed looking at each other :)).  I attempted to appear a bit more lively tonight than in previous shows, seeing as that's often noted as something on which we need improvement.  At some point during the concert, I whispered into Katie's ear that I loved her... I think she liked that :)  I was glad to see Natty and Isaiah were able to come as well... Isaiah and I spoke for about 30 minutes about economics and forign policy after the concert.  Afterward, Katie, Dustin, Corey, Jenn, and I went to Steak 'n Shake for a post-concert dinner, then Dustin brought me home."

"event","Freshmen Orientation at Ga Tech was last Sunday/Monday... I don't think I've ever been surrounded by so many people who could actually conduct an intelligent conversation :)  I skipped most of the sessions, as they were completely pointless (particularly if one had previously attended Connect With Tech), and just exploring campus/meeting some people/eating better meals than the ones provided.  Unlike Connect With Tech, I actually socialized a fair amount, getting a few email addresses, and staying out until 3:00 on Monday morning (I don't think my roommate was pleased when I woke him after he'd be sleeping a while).

Most of my time was spent with Patricia, Courtney, and Alex, speaking with the latter two for almost 4 hours Sunday night/Monday morning.  The conversation was actually fairly deep and certainly intelligent... not bad for people I randomly met a few hours before.  Coincidentally, Alex was the only other Math major there, but we didn't know this until only the two of us showed up at the Math adviser.  Anyway, I'm completely convinced Tech is absolutely perfect for me... from the social scene, to the urban environment, to the challenging classes; I will love it.

My classes are as follows (14 hours):

CS 1321 (Sebastian gave me an online copy of the text book and a copy of Scheme last year; so when Dad and I were in Barnes and Nobel and he randomly opened the text book about 3/4 of the way through, I recognized a program I had already made... this class should be easy)
Math 1501 (Calc I... skimming the text revealed a lot of stuff I learned in Brie's class)
ENG 1501 (Freshmen English... blah)
POL 1101 (Intro to Political Science, should be pretty interesting)
PSYC 1000 (not a psych class at all, just some dumb freshmen thing... making resumes, getting a job, blahblahblah... at least it's only an hour and an easy A)

Sound check for the concert on the 1st was last night after I got home from Tech.  James was a bit pissed at Kevin for the setup, and was generally in a bad mood all night... other than that, however, I think it went well.  I'm looking forward to the concert this Friday... I don't doubt it'll be our best show ever.  

I spent most of today with Katie, meeting up around 1 for lunch, then hanging out at her house for a while, after which I took her to the doctor and waited on her (aren't I a nice boyfriend?).  Following that, we ate dinner with her parents, where I heard, in more detail than before, pretty much everything about the accident back in 77... truly an amazing story.  Then we went shopping for shirts for the concert on Friday, but weren't able to find much, so got a movie, went back to her house, and watched it.  It's nice being completely comfortable with someone... especially when she knows you better than anyone else.  As she said in her xanga... she's not only my girlfriend, but my best friend (of course, we were good friends even before we started dating, something I highly recommend from now on :)).

Stuart left me a message today around 1:00 saying he needed something done by 3:00... 'tis a shame I wasn't going to get the message until I got home around 12:00.  He'll eventually learn that asking me to do stuff same-day is generally not a good idea :)  Ah well, that's all folks."

Katie and I visited our grandmothers on Thursday, having lunch with her Mom's Mom, and dinner with my Mom's Mom.  It was a fairly enjoyable day, I suppose.  We played Boggle and Scrabble too, which are always fun.  Word games are so interesting... I don't usually consider myself as having much of an aptitude for lingual subjects, but I really enjoy testing my vocabulary and, moreso in Boggle than Scrabble, my pattern recognition skills.  

Today, Jason and I had some homeschool conference at the Cobb Galleria, so he and I went over to Cumberland for lunch, and then over to the Galleria (the conference started around 2, I think).  Seeing as we were eight-sixteenths of an hour early, we played chess for a while in the exhibit hall.  The only well-known speaker was Phillip Johnson (Berkeley Law professor, and avowed anti-Evolutionist), who gave the opening lecture.  Anyway, had dinner with Mom and Dad at Ruby Tuesday, attended the final session, then started driving on down to On The Bricks.

Somewhere around I-75 South and Howell Mill, some blue strobe lights appeared behind me... thankfully nothing happened.  Anyway, we met up with Clay, Dustin, and Katie there at On The Bricks.  Tonight's sound, from a technical standpoint, wasn't nearly as good as Lifehouse.  One speaker was constantly buzzing through an entire song, amazingly enough.  Ah well, Maroon 5 was still good... especially the guitarist.  Katie and I decided not to stay around for Everclear (which happened to be a good move... Dustin said they really sucked), so we went on back to her place for a while, then I came home.

And now I'm here, waiting for this fricking video to render, updating my journal to waste time."

The video should turn out fairly well, especially the little Indiana Jones intro scenes (I particularly like the arrangement Georgia and I came up with for those).  I was at Stuart's house until 5:30 this morning, but I left before it was completed, attempting to beat traffic back to Atlanta... who knew there could be so many people up at 6 in the morning.  The speeches this year were of a lower caliber than last year... I had to rewrite one or two, in fact, just so they weren't quite on a second grade level.  The speeches were only rivaled by the footage, the quality of which is simply deplorable.  I don't believe I've seen such shoddy, nauseating camera work since the Blair Witch Project.  The entire time I was capturing it, I couldn't help but wonder whether this was the camera person's first time.  From now on, if I'm going to do a video, I'm taping it myself... when you're the editor, you know what shots you want for certain parts, you know how things will look when editing, and, perhaps most of all, you have an appreciation for good taping :)  Ah well, editing with Stuart is quite a pain as well; he acts as though he knew what he were doing, as though he'd done this before.

Last night, I finished the New York Times bestseller, <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em>.  I basically expected another fiscally responsible how-to guide with the typical ""invest early"", ""mutual funds are your friend"", and, of course ""the wonders of compound interest""; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it challenged many common ideas pertaining to money.  First, money isn't real... of course, we all know this (or at least, anyone who has attended an economics class).  Money used to be backed by various standards (gold, silver, etc...) which meant that for each paper dollar you had, there was actual gold or silver that it represented.  Now, however, money has no value other than what we agree it to be... the book didn't actually even get into much detail other that saying money isn't real... I just kinda felt like extrapolating on it :)  It also challenges assumptions like your car/house are assets, risk is bad, and that you should work for money.  The point of the book was making you understand that money should work for you, not that you should work for it.  The one rule he leaves you with is, basically, but assets, not liabilities (along with generally increasing financial intelligence).  Seems simple enough, problem is knowing what is what :)  Anyway, I highly recommend this book... especially at a young age, understanding these principles will serve you well later in life.

Today, I finished <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> by JD Salinger.  I found I related fairly well to the narrator, Holden, mainly in his finding most of the people in the world to be phony.  Of course, I don't necessarily feel depressed or have suicidal thoughts, as did he.  Something I've noticed in myself, however, is that phony people just tend to amuse me (Nicole and I had a discussion about this a while ago).  People are often surprised at who I spend time with, and I'd say mostly it's for my amusement and enjoyment.  I occasionally attempt to stimulate conversation with some ""intellectual"" topic, though this usually fails unless the conversation is one-on-one... perhaps this is why I prefer non-group activities.  Perhaps the strangest phrase I'm often told is ""you make me think""... I assure you all that this is my intention :)"

Thursday started out around 8:00 as I awoke to my cell phone alarm.  I hurriedly prepared myself for the day... then I went down 78, got CFA for myself and Natty, and arrived at the Robertson's house.  Natty's Mom wasn't home yet, so we just talked for 20 minutes or so as I ate, and poked fun at her cousin, David, pressure washing their pool.  Afterward, Donna and I discussed her business' website (http://dolcibydonna.com), and I set up the nameserver information, etc... blahblahblah.  Following that, Natty and I listened to some old records (mmm... Fleetwood Mac), I saw her mural thing she's painting, and I departed for Border's.  I was suppose to meet Katie later that night for a youth group activity at her church, and had a few hours to kill, so I started reading the financial bestseller, <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em>.  I finished about half of it in the Border's cafeteria, in approximately 2 hours... quite an interesting read.  I'll write a review of it upon completion, probably... it's a good book.  I highly recommend it already.  I left Border's around 4:00 and stopped by CFA to eat lunch and do a few lessons of Spanish... after that I went down to Katie's house.

I arriived at Katie's house around 5ish, and proceeded to take a nap while she ate/got ready.  We left around 6, met the rest of her group at Park Place, at which point Jason called me to remind me that I was suppose to tape a magic show at my church that night.  Thankfully, he offered to tape it for me, except that I had the camera.  We agreed to meet half-way, so I flew from Park Place (way down almost in Rockdale) to the Super Target off W Park Place, where I met him.  On the way back, Libby gave me directions to her house, where the youth group was meeting after the church for a Bible study... somewhere way out in the boonies.  Amazingly, I remembered the directions and got there without any help or getting lost.  I think Katie was surprised :)

The Bible study was on the topic of using your experiences to help others, and what God might be teaching you through your experiences... Libby did a wonderful job.  Afterward, Katie, Ashley, and I drove to the bowling alley separately (way down in Conyers... ugh...) and met everyone else there.  Andrea, Ashley, Katie, and I were on our own lane... which was pretty fun.  After two games, I took Katie home, though we stopped for Wendy's on the way.  Then Katie and I said our goodbyes, and I came home... ah, three paragraphs for... Thursday.  Wait until Friday ;)

Jason decides to wake me up on Friday, inviting me to go bowling with Clay and himself.  We end up meeting down at Midtown Express Lanes or something like that, just off Cheshire Bridge.  Then Jason and I come home, fix up the car a bit, and I drive down to pick up Katie for our two month anniversary.  I know it generally isn't much, but I felt like doing something nicer... so we dressed up a bit, and I took her to the Old Spaghetti Factory off Ponce.  After that, I took her to the Westin Peachtree Plaza, and up to the top with the wonderful view of the city.  We looked down at On The Bricks and Ga Tech, and other random things in Atlanta happening on a Friday night, then just drove up Peachtree St for a while, wondering what to do next.

Katie's grandmother, Nanu, wanted to see us dressed up a bit, so we went over her house for a few minutes, then back to Katie's.  We stayed there for another few hours, just talking and being together... quite nice and romantic, if I do say so myself.  That was by far the most I've ever spent on a girl in one night, but... Katie's worth it :)

I met Katie for breakfast at Waffle House to start today (Saturday).  Band practice started at 11, with Corey absent for today (unfortunately, he probably needs more work than do we :)), and we really just worked on a few rough songs.  Notably, we did Amazing Haze (Purple Haze with the lyrics to Amazing Grace) today... something I actually ""sing"" (yes, quotes needed).  I believe it went fairly well, at least the guitar parts, the vocals probably left something to be desired.  Katie and I came back to my house for a while, ate dinner with my parents at Jason's Deli, and went to see Art Garfunkle tonight with Dustin and his parents.  The first opening act was fairly pathetic, but the second act was really good (the drummer and bassist were awesome), and then Art was, of course, magnificent.  Cecilia was really neat, with a 5 minute drum solo in the middle that rivals any I've ever heard.  I called Jason/Mom for Mrs Robinson, so hopefully they enjoyed that... and then the Sound of Silence was the last song for the first encore... my personal favorite Simon and Garfunkle song.  Afterward, Dustin brought Katie and me back to my house, then we met Katie's parents at the CVS near me... it was a very pleasant evening... nice to have Katie next to me at the concert, holding hands, etc...

Anyway, here's a picture of Katie and I on Friday:

It actually went well, with us almost playing through the entire set list (albeit backwards).  The bass/drums still aren't ""tight""; but I think James, Katie, and I can perform our parts pretty well.  I've been working today on a few weak spots (notably in Don't Speak, Enough, and If You Could Only See), so maybe that'll be better for Saturday.

Tuesday... Jason and I met Dad for lunch at N DeKalb Mall, and then went to the bank because Jason's ATM card stopped working.  He wanted to just withdraw some money from the teller, saying he didn't need an ATM card anyway, but I convinced him it'd be better if he got one.  After that, I dropped him off at the house, and went to Katie's.  It's always nice to be greeted with her running out to give me a hug and a kiss.  Then we had an interesting conversation with Kevin, and went to Applebee's (my favorite... thanks, Katie).  Discovered (yet again) just how well we know each other, and then met Danielle and Mark to see Finding Nemo.  Although the story itslef is rather amusing, the animation is simply marvelous.  Pixar movies are amazing... I mean... the textures are so realistic... if anything, they're too perfect, they need some imperfection to seem real.  The underwater parts, I would imagine, are even more complex as far as rendering glare and such... although a simpler background, I suppose.  Anyway, on the way home, she played Everything for my by Lifehouse and kinda sang it to me... quite sweet :)  Then we spent some more time at her house, and I came home... and talked to her some more

Today, I read a bit more of the Catcher and the Rye, practiced guitar most of the day, and went to church.  Scott was on an anti-intellectual tangent tonight, and at the end asked everyone to go down for an alter call, saying that everyone needed to be down there.  This really irks me, I can't stand when pastors guilt people into coming to the alter.  In addition, his anti-intellectual message (basically saying we should eschew worldly knowledge, and just blindly accept the Bible) creates a mindset of Christians being ignorant fools that don't need to go to college or be ""smart""... which is completely wrong.  Anyway... went out to eat afterwards at Applebee's, then took Nikkie home, said hi to her sisters, and came home.  G'night all."

"event","A friend told me that once... I, unfortunately, can't emphathize one bit.  I hate to eat.  Were it possible, I'd be perfectly content with never eating again, perhaps being fed intravenously.  I often forget meals... and am rarely hungry; it isn't unusual at all for me to skip 2/3 of my meals in a day.  But, alas, eating has such importance, for instance: that whole nutrition thing.  In addition, socially, eating is very important.  Indeed, the Bible describes Heaven as ""a grand feast""... what great joy that brings to me.

So what does everyone think about the African-Uranium/Weapons of Mass Destruction fiasco now?  Of course, if you really thought the war was about WMDs, you're about as naive as... um... something really naive (can't think of a good comparison... perhaps... as naive as a Christmas tree?).  Anyway, I'm not aligning myself with the econauts claiming it was a war for oil (though the thought has crossed my mind), but, nor am I believing it was entirely for the official stated reasons.

Did anyone really think we were going to find lots of evidence over there?  I can name one person who obviously didn't: George W Bush.  If he were as confident by the end as he seemed at the onset of the war, the focus wouldn't have shifted from ""WMDs"" to ""freeing the Iraqis from the big bad evil-doer, Saddam"".  Not that it isn't a nobel cause, but it isn't justification for invading another country and toppling a regime.  In fact, it was a very Clinton-esque handling of the situation, not something of which I'm terribly fond.

People really shouldn't blindly trust the government so much.  I remember telling Natty yesterday something to the effect of ""it's our patriotic duty to not trust the government"".  In addition, our ""two party system"" should really be renamed ""two wings of the same party"".  The differences between Republicans and Democracts are dwindling, as Nicole pointed out yesterday.  Then we went on joking about how the US had gone expansionist, and that we needed to conquer a bunch of other countries :)

Saturday was good... went over Katie's, saw Danielle (note: Danielle seems really neat... fairly shy/reserved, yet intelligent too), had dinner with Christina for her B-day, vainly went to three music stores to find guitar strings, and finished the night at a nearly pointless band practice.  Went bowling with Jason yesterday... a brother night, I suppose.  I consider it a bit of a math lesson in exponents, though... for instance, if you bet a coke, and go double or nothing twice... that's equivement to 4 cokes.  We played 4 games... scores:
<pre>
Jason    Justin
122      122
145      155
115      119
155      167
</pre>
Ah well, 'twas fun.  Bye all."

Imagine a life where lying on your back is your greatest thrill, and where a tennis ball or the remaining calcium deposits of a dead animal bring you unexceedable joy.

"event","I recently stumbled upon this perplexing paragraph, donated to the public domain by one Mark Twain a number of years ago:

In promulgating your esoteric cogitations, or articulating your superficial sentimentalities and amicable, philosophical or psychological observations, beware of platitudinous ponderosity. Let your conversational communications possess a clarified conciseness, a compact comprehensibleness, coalescent consistency, and a concatenated cogency. Eschew all conglomerations of flatulent garrulity, jejune babblement and asinine affectations. Let your extemporaneous descantings and unpremeditated expatiations have intelligibility and veracious vivacity, without rhodomontade or thrasonical bombast. Sedulously avoid all polysyllabic profundity, pompous prolixity, psittaceous vacuity, ventriloquial verbosity and vaniloquent vapidity. Shun double-entendres, purient pscosity, and pestiferous profanity, obscurant or apparent. 

Next time your English teacher accuses you of writing from a thesauras... just show him/her this lovely work of, well, polysyllabic profundity ;)  And now, on to slightly less important, though vastly more interesting, updateage (bite me, so I started a sentence with a conjunction...)

I recently discovered a modern literary treasure: my brother's online journal.  'Tis quite a shame I never noticed it before, seeing as it's prominently displayed in his AIM profile.  For those interested, the link is <a href=""http://blogitall.com/blog.asp?un=jason"">http://blogitall.com/blog.asp?un=jason</a>.  I think I'll devote the remainder of this paragraph to explaining my brother as best I see fit.  He's certainly intelligent, though as academic as his own hamster.  He has developed web sites (namely <a href=""http://myonlinequiz.com"">My Online Quiz</a>) with millions of visitors, yet no real means to become profitable (aside from a few dollars from banner ads).  Despite this, his coding style is sloppy and any sane CS professor would flunk him, yet his programs amazingly appear to work the majority of the time.  Abstraction is his enemy, and kludge jobs his specialty.  I somewhat fondly remember a challenge we once had: to develop competing Connect-4 programs, and see which won.  He, ahem, ""borrowed"" his program from a code-distribution website, whilst I slaved for a day or so to perfect my AI.  However, were it not for his liberal interpretation of the rules, I'd not have been pressured to keep working on my program until it was able to beat ""his"".  I'm still waiting on my checkers challenge ;)  He's one of the most generous fellows I know, yet most forms of bacteria have more culture than does he.  While lacking in social skill, he more than makes up for it in tagging along with me :)  Like me, the majority of his friends are older than himself, though particularly lacking in estrogen content.  His entrepreneurial spirit will most likely lead to him either becoming extremely rich, or extremely poor... I find it simply impossible to envision him working some 9-5 job in a stuffy grey box for 40 years just to have the government tell him that his pension bought a few AAMRAM missiles for our war on the <em>country-du-jour</em>.  Perhaps I speak too much of the young lad sleeping but a few feet above me now.  Ah well, he'll be glad to be mentioned.

Earlier today (yesterday, technically), Natty pointed out an article claiming that the way the majority of high school students write could be best described as a ""tangled mass of internet lingo"".  Do people really have such a difficult time distinguishing formal essays from informal IM conversations?  Not that I'm a terribly huge fan of internet shorthand in general, but how hard is it to avoid use in formal papers?  More importantly than that, however, is the lack of coherence... basic theses, outlines, and concise points.  We discussed a few possible causes, from not readings much (presumably the fault of TV or the computer).  As previously stated, I believe TV dinners are the root cause of the dumbing down of America ;)

Of course, the highlight of Friday was On The Bricks that night.  Allow me to list the friends that accompanied me (along with probably 80,000 other people): Katie, Melanie, Christina, Danielle, Butch, Nikkie, Dustin, Clay, and Jason.  I realized something tonight I've noticed a few times before, that I seem to be the common link between a lot of people I hang out with on a regular basis.  It's almost as though I've formed my own social group, after giving up on everyone else's.  For instance, Dustin knows me from Masters, an while he technically knew Jason, they'd never have become friends were it not for my originally befriending Dustin.  Nikkie, of course, was a friend from Pleasantdale, and now is Dustin's girlfriend.  They're all connected to the Mustard Seed social group through me (with whom we often eat out).  Katie came to Mustard Seed through Natalie, a friend of mine... and now she's my girlfriend.  Rachel and Christina are part of our social group through Katie, who came to be part of the group through me.  Melanie, who also previously knew Jason and Dustin, has remained friends only with me and came tonight because of me.  And then, how could we forget Georgia, who still seems to talk to many of my friends... obviously a connection through me.  Other various people whom I don't see as much, for instance Chris or Rachel Sedlak, are also links into the social group through me... though I didn't count them in this exercise for the don't hang out with this group very often.  Ah well, pardon my tangent... it's 5:01 ;)

As for the concert, it was fabulous.  Melanie and I rode together, and somehow made it to the Varsity near our meeting time.  From there, we went down to Centennial Park, although I believe Butch wasn't as familiar with downtown as I am :)  Anyway... $3 admission... good stuff.  Ingram Hill was the first major band to play, and I'd say they might have been the best band of the night, had I been familiar with their songs.  There's something about familiarity that makes one enjoy a song more when it's performed.  Lifehouse played next, and were, as you'd expect, very good.  Katie and I embraced each other during ""Everything"", a nice sweet moment.  Better Than Ezra was the closer, and was also very good.  Clay, Jason, Dustin, and Nikkie left after Lifehouse finished, and then Butch, Christina, Katie, and Danielle left after a song or two by Better than Ezra, so Melanie and I found each other and listened to a few more songs together before departing.  Anyway, it was a great night."

"event","I don't really care to get into details tonight... so this may be short :)

I read the Picture of Dorian Gray this week... quite a good book.  Oscar Wilde is a great writer, though I disagreed when my cousin Sarah told me this a long time ago.  My reading list now includes Harry Potter (don't flame me... I've had some friends love it, and some hate it... so I'm now reading the first one to decide for myself), The Catcher and the Rye, and Jane Eyre.  I'm getting moreso into the classics, it seems... something I've never really been interested in before now.  

I went rafting down the Middle Ocoee on Monday with First Baptist, by far the best rafting trip I've ever attended.  I ended up not really talking with anyone in the youth group, but staying around the few adults and a college couple.  Band practice that night was a bit exasperating... I wish certain members would know their parts and not forget every week.

Tuesday, did a bit of Spanish (so far I've done over a year of coursework in about a month and half).  Then I met up with Jared and Katie, went over Dustin's and stayed for a while.  Dustin and Nikkie ended up singing along while I played guitar, which was fun.  There was a bit of disagreement as to where we should eat, but, um, yours truly came up with a nice compromise :)

Wednesday... I went to church for the first time in a while.  The sound system was a complete mess, so I spent about an hour fixing all that, and hooking up the video stuff.  Went out to eat after, quite exciting.  Rachel came along... oddly enough.  Not certain how that came about, but it was fun having her there.

Today... went with Jason, Nikkie, Dustin, Rachel, and Katie to see some pirate movie where the star resembled a male hooker (make-up and all).  It was fairly interesting, but not worth $6.50.  After that, stopped by First Baptist for a while to check on sound equipment and drop Jason off, then went to Wedny's to eat before seeing the preview of The Tale of Cymbeline at the Shakespeare Festival tonight.  Don't we all feel more intelligent after seeing that? ;) (told you all you'd have no trouble understanding it anyway)

Going to Lifehouse tomorrow... should be fun.  Melanie, whom I haven't seen since her graduation party, will be coming too.  Hopefully I'll be home by 12... who knows :)"

"event","ah, what a good few days... Monday was spent studying muchos espanol (about 4 normal-class-weeks worth, I estimate), and then band practice and the interview that night.  Kevin and I arrived early, and handled the interview mostly ourselves (Corey and James were yet to arrive when the reporter came).  At first, she asked mostly about Faith Community (the church at which we practice), so Kevin answered all that... and then she asked about the band some.  Afterward, she photographed us practicing (we ""performed"" three songs for her, sans a vocalist; unfortunately Katie's away this week).  I believe it all went fairly well... the article should run in late July.  We added Number 9 and Crazy Times to the set list, and they seemed decent in practice.  I suppose we'll see how they turn out in reality.

Yesterday, Melanie called to make sure we were still going to hear Lifehouse on the 11th... which, of course, we are.  We ended up talking for a while, oddly enough (I generally hate the phone, but she lacks IM, so we mostly just email).  After that, Dustin, Nikkie, and I went up to the lake house in the pouring rain... lovely.  We ended up going out on the lake during the storm anyway, which was actually quite fun.  Unfortunately, I was the only one that felt like water skiing that day (or perhaps merely in the rain), so they were just lazy and stayed in the boat and... uhm... had fun.  Needless to say, I neglected to bring the video camera out on Friday... except to catch Dustin speeding in the rain as I told him to attempt not to kill me.  We ended up watching Analyze That and Willow last night (although, I didn't really watch the latter, was mostly focused on the computer).  Katie and I talked on the phone for 5 minutes (we've talked every day this week... quite nice, if I do say so myself.  We've talked everyday since she's gotten back from Alaska, I think).  Dustin and I, somewhat amazingly, talked until 5 in the morning... I think we had a few too many Mtn Dews.

The plan was for Jason to meet us at the exit at 10am today.  Needless to say, Dustin and I sleep in, and then w sort of wake up, and Nikkie comes in and joins Dustin on the bed.  This, however, put me in the interesting position of Nikkie being in the room while I was wearing boxers and a t-shirt... oh well, c'est la vie... I got dressed anyway, and she turned her head :)  Jason ended up being early, so we flew over to the exit to get him.  Got back, switched into swim clothes, and then we went down to the lake.

First, we were going to do skiing... so I nominated Jason, who had never attempted water skiing before today.  He, however, wanted someone to go first, so he could see how it was done.  I ended up going first... stayed up for a while... had fun with the fricking huge wake from the boat (Dustin's a pretty fun person to have driving a boat).  Then Jason tried a few times, unfortunately he wasn't able to get up (can't really say anything, everyone falls their first few times... but most of us keep on going ;)).  Dustin then went once or twice, then we went back to get the tube, wakeboard, and video camera.

Jason was up first on the tube... and he amazingly held on much longer than I anticipated.  Of course, he hated being taped, but he really should be proud to have had that recorded.  I went next... caught some major air (Dustin said I was about 10 feet off at one point).  I completely killed my back and rear extremity.  Unfortunately, as seems to always be the case, my friends prove to be less talented videographers than am I, so I'm not sure how well the video turned out of me.  Dustin was next, so I drove the boat (heh, only the two of us were allowed to drive).  I, um, only hit 20... or 25... or 30... with him trailing me ;)  The video of that didn't turn out so well either, though (Jason needs to work on tracking ability, methinks).  After that, I tried the wake board, with little sucess... no one gets that on the first try either, and no one else tried besides me.

Anyway, Jason and I left around 3, got home a little after 5 (stopping to eat on the way).  I've done some work on a site for Stuart for church recently, adding the last thing today.  <a href=""http://hmumcyouth.org/"">http://hmumcyouth.org/</a>.  In case you couldn't guess... it's basically a copy of my livejournal style, but it seemed to work well.  Other than that, I've been moving DNS stuff over to my server the last few days.  Ah well, my life in a nutshell."

"event","I'm leaving tomorrow morning for summer camp and I'll be gone until the fourth of July. Sad! I'll miss everyone a lot (especially Justin). I'm sure you've noticed by now that this is Katie :) Anyway, Justin and I were sure last night that he couldn't come over to see me today even though I'm leaving for camp tomorrow and this will be the longest that we've been apart since I've been his girlfriend. Today when I got home from church, I talked to him online and told him that I wished that he could come over. He decided to ask and his parents said yes :) That was exciting... so he came over and got to my house about 3:30 or something like that. He and I just sat and talked for a while until he and I practiced for a while for next Sunday (he's coming to my church to play guitar for me because I have to do a song during the service and I wanted him to play guitar for me) before we ate supper. He and I ate out on my front porch which was nice and relaxing. Oh and earlier on... I played him a song from a cd that I burned(""Dance"" by Derek Webb)and he learned how to play it really quickly for me. We might do that song next Sunday for my special music in the service. I love that song and I was so impressed that he learned it so quickly after hearing it only a time or two before. He and I just talked and enjoyed spending time with each other for the last time for a week or so. I really am going to miss him but I know he's going to have a fun week while I'm gone. Y'all livejournal people need to make sure he's good while I'm gone ;) Just kidding... sorry, couldn't resist that :) Now I'll leave you with something that I love very much...

L is for the way you look at me
O is for the only one I see
V is very very extraordinary
E is even more than anyone that you adore
Love is all that I can give to you
Love is more than just a game for two
Two in love can make it
Take my heart and please don't break it
Love was made for me and you"

"event","Yesterday's festivities began when Justin got here late in the afternoon. He and I sat around and talked until we had to leave to go out to eat with my family and my cousin Melinda (she offered him a job when he goes to Tech in the fall). He and I ate with them (Dustin called at that time and we told him to pick up a movie and come over) then headed back to my house. Dustin, Christina, and Jason all came over and we went to Chick-fil-a to pick up some food for Christina and Jason before getting back to my house. Dustin and Jason rented Signs (which sucked so bad but it was one of the few options) and we didn't even watch the whole movie. We turned it off not even halfway through the movie because it was so bad. We all just talked and tried to get the Internet back to working on my computer before Jason and Dustin had to leave. Justin stayed here for a while longer... actually longer than he planned to stay. Christina asked me to go to her car to get her bag out of her car. When I looked for her keys... I couldn't find them. They had fallen out in Dustin's car so he had to turn around and bring them back to her. After he left, Justin left too. Christina and I did talk to Justin again last night though because he and I had our nightly phone call before I go to bed. 

Today was another fun filled day. Justin got here a little after 4 and we hung out here before eating with my family. He and I went to Best Buy after dinner and bought a movie for us to watch (Monty Python and the Holy Grail... excellent choice). We stopped by my grandma's house on the way home and stayed there for a little while. Let me give you a little background... my whole family lives on my street (Nanu, Aunt Pam, Erin, Uncle Jerry, Uncle Paul, Aunt Becky, Aunt Mary Grace, Uncle Ralph). Yes this is odd that we all live in almost a row down my street, but it's also nice to have them all so near. What started out as an innocent conversation with Justin, my grandma, and I turned into full blown chaos. I went over to the next yard to see my Uncle, then my cousin, aunt, and my mom all came over. So Justin, Nanu, Mom, Aunt Pam, Erin, Uncle Jerry, and I are all sitting on the porch talking. Basically Justin got to experience the full insanity of my family for the first time. Anyway... he and I came back to my house, watched the movie, and talked for a while. The next thing that happened was what I like to think as the highlight of the day... we went in my yard and looked at the stars. It was so nice and I think it was the high point of my day. I won't see him after tonight for a week because I have summer camp. I'll miss him a lot and I hope he has a good week without me (this is Katie in case you couldn't tell before now). Bye all :)"

"event","I saw the preview of The School for Wives at the Shakespeare Festival on Thursday night.  Rachel was figuring there wouldn't be a large crowd, being a Moliere play at a Shakespeare festival; however, there were about 300 people there for the preview (read: dress rehersal).  Moliere eschewed the ""respected"" theme of tragedy for the less respected comedy, though managing to still make a point in his plays.  'Tis a shame he wasn't English :)  Anyway, The School for Wives was done in a vaudeville style, of which I'm generally not a fan... but for some reason it seemed to work well for this.  Afterward, we (by which I mean Talitha, Rachel, and Andrew) went to Brusters, caught up on Master's gossip and made fun of Tal's and my short-lived relationship.  Then I brought them all back to Rachel's house and went home... good times."

Actually, I've been home since Tuesday but my computer has been acting up and I haven't been able to update. While I was gone, I talked to Justin everyday and told him everything that happened at orientation. I know this is his journal and all about him but I want to say something about my college. As soon as we drove into the front gate of the campus, I fell in love with the college. It's in the mountains and it's absolutely beautiful. The college is perfect for me, I couldn't have asked for a better college. It's centered around the ROTC so it's all about military life. They're Southern people, they're concerned with respect, it's a small town, small college, it's perfect. Enough about me... while I was gone, Justin had a good bit of stuff to do. He had band practice and other things like that. I missed seeing him while I was gone but he came over yesterday so that made up for it. He came over to my house yesterday at 11:30... actually it was 11:26 but who's counting. We ate here and then just stayed at my house for a while before I had to go to guitar lessons. During my guitar lesson, Justin went to eat somewhere because he was bored and hungry. He came and got me after my lesson then took me to eat somewhere (he ate some of my fries but that was ok). Then we went to Dustin's house where we watched a movie with Dustin and Nikkie which was fun. We stayed there for a while, left there, and headed to my grandma's house for a while. We finally went back to my house where we talked with my family for a little bit before we stood in the driveway and argued about who started flirting with who first when we started actually talking to each other a couple of months ago (he started it by the way). We did the usual talking on the phone til really late before I went to bed. Oh and something exciting happened at about midnight last night! My best friend is a US Marine and I called him to see how he was doing and when he was getting to come home to visit us (he's stationed in CA where he's learning to speak Arabic and he's coming home next Thursday for 10 days). He called me back and I got to talk to him for the first time since he called me on my graduation day! Anyway... I think that's all I have to say right now. Thank you for your time :)"

"event","Friday... got up, went to the bank, went to the eye doctor to grab my perscription, came home, went to Costco to get glasses, ate, came back home, then the fun started.  Natty and Isaiah got Katie from a party, and then we all met at Stone Mountain for a while.  Meeting Isaiah was interesting (note: for all those who are unaware, Isaiah is Natalie's online boyfriend who came down to visit for 2 weeks this summer).  At first, I felt as though he were either attempting to impress me with his intelligence, or perhaps trying to make himself look smarter than me.  Also odd was his choice of clothing: a button down shirt and khakis for Stone Mountain, a bit overdressed to say the least.  The situation remained awkward for a few minutes, and then Nikkie and Dustin joined the rest of us (note: Jason was there too).  At that point, Natalie, Isaiah, and I started what Katie describes as ""smart people talk"" (note: this really means just poking fun at Bushie Jr's terrorist and international policies) while everyone else moved away and started talking amongst themselves.  Unfortunately, we couldn't stay longer, so our discussion was cut short and everyone sans Natty and Isaiah piled in my car and went to Chick-Fil-A for dinner.

We got back to the park just in time to hear the last song of the Hiss... but they were pretty good.  The next band, whose name escapes me, was pretty much horrible... just a bassist and drummer.  Katie and I just hung out back away from the crowd, while Nikkie, Dustin, and Jason moved forward for the White Stripes.  At exactly 9:30... the Stripes took the stage and were awesome.  Unfortunately, Katie and I left around 10:15 so as to beat traffic out of the park and escape the contact high we were getting from the people around us.  As we were leaving, I got a call from Jason: Nikkie passed out.  Oh the joys of concerts :)  Katie and I stayed at her house for a while, before I came home around 11:30.

Saturday began, for me, at 7:00 with a pleasant wake up call from Katie... unfortunately, I thought it was my alarm clock and hung up on her :)  Anyway, we performed some music for a fair at her church, spent some time with her friends, then just hung out the rest of the day.  She was really sweet all day long, made me feel really loved.  Anyway... enough rambling... she's at N Ga College now, having a good time, meeting people, wearing the shirt I left at her house yesterday (doh!), etc...

Sunday started really early too (another wake up call :)), then I went to church early... as always.  On this day, however, I was playing guitar instead of running sound,perfect day too: we performed My Glorious.  That song is an awesome song to just rock with (hmm, ended sentence in a preposition).  Anyway, then, as always, I had to tear down the sound stuff.  I think I do more work for that second service than anyone else.  I slept a good bit of the day, then went back to play guitar again that night.  Afterward, I went grocery shopping for ""whatever I'll need for the next week"", paid for by Mom.  That was actually pretty interesting... who knew grocery shopping could be :)

"event","Last night, after band practice, a certain friend of Katie's and Katie talked on the phone for about 20 minutes.  The topic of conversation being yours truly, the friend proceeded to inform Katie of why:

1. She was compromising her standards by dating me.
2. My frieds were a bad influence.
3. I wasn't spiritual enough.

Rarely in my life have I ever had someone rail against me in such an objectionable manner.  Generally I wouldn't feel the need to comment on such obvious stupidity, but for some reason, perhaps boredom, I felt like doing it today.  Though I'd like to think this was some dispassionate discourse on hypocrisy, I must admit this is somewhat of an impassioned defense of my character; and hence, if I become harsh at times, try to understand.

First, lowering standards?  Pray tell, what standard could I possibly be below?  Am I not nice?  Am I not intelligent?  Am I not a honest, decent, moral being?  The only possibility I could think of was appearance, but I'm certain such a spiritual person as Katie's friend wouldn't care about that.  Perhaps she meant physical standards, but even at that, we haven't done anything wrong or bad or that would compromise our standards.

Second, I take much offense at this comment.  Surely such a spiritual person, such at Katie's friend, remembers in the Bible where Jesus socialized with sinners.  I suppose her memory isn't as good as her opinion of her own spirituality.  Should Christians be nothing more than an incestuous clique?  Pardon this, but it is people like that which make me thankful not all my friends are super-spiritual Christians hypocrites.

Third, judge my character, judge my friends, and now judge my relationship with God.  I think she'd make a good pharisee :)  There are so many problems with this, I don't know where to start.  Perhaps I could remind her that we aren't suppose to judge others, or perhaps that we really can't know the state of someone else's heart.  But then again, I'm also sure such a spiritual person would know that already ;)

In conclusion, I really desire to spout a long string of adjectives describing this goddess, but I don't feel that necessary, as she seems perfectly capable of making a fool of herself without my help.  In addition to judging me, Katie's friend is really insulting Katie by saying all this, as if Katie weren't ""spiritual"" enough. Besides, I'd hate to judge the friend and be a hypocrite :)"

Saturday was perfectly splendid.  I got up, went to band practice, hung out with Katie and had a great time, practiced a bit for the thing next Saturday, and then came home around 6:20.  Last night, Nikkie, Dustin, and I, along with Dustin's brother, his wife, and a friend, went to see Norah Jones at Chastain.  Mom packed me a nice dinner: turkey sandwich, grapes, Mtn Dew, etc... and we ate there at our table.  The opening act was Gillian Welch, whom I had never heard of (doh! ended a sentence in a preposition... developing nervous twitch now).  She was decent, I suppose, especially the last two songs, but nothing really noteworthy.  

Around 8:45, Norah took the stage.  She opened with Cold Cold Heart, my personal favorite song of hers.  Anyway, the concert was wonderful, and I love Chastain... much more intimate than Phillips or other venues.  It was probably my second favorite concert ever, right behind Fleetwood Mac (of course).  I wish Katie could have come, I always associate Norah with Katie, because Katie introduced her to me, so I was thinking of her quite a bit of the night ;)  Anyway, we also had great parking, and were out of the park by 11, and I was home by 11:10ish.

I'd update about today... but there's really been nothing interesting of which to speak.  Happy Father's Day, all."

"event","Isn't it odd how plans and situations can mutate into some completely different form so quickly?  If one had asked me my plans for the day when I awoke this morning, I'd have replied with something along the lines of ""picking up Amanda and seeing Blues Traveler with Nik, Dustin, James, and Kelli"".  As the day progressed, however, I discovered Kelli's parents were in town, and that James and Kelli would not be able to come.  No big deal, we still had a nice group, until Amanda decided she didn't care to brave the inclement weather.  Down to a clan of three, Katie invites us to some random event at some random church way out in Rockdale county.  After a slightly glimpse outside, I quickly decide an indoor event would be preferable to On The Bricks.  So my night concluded with attending the service, named ""Overflow"" (a nice description of which follows this paragraph), and then a slight disagreement which led the majority of onlookers to believe me an inconsiderate jerk, though really no fault of my own.

As for the service, it was some random fellow whose name was yet to grace my ears before tonight: Derek Webb.  Evidentially he is somewhat well known in certain social circles, mostly for his work in Caedmon's Call (which I have heard of), which I assume he recently left to pursue a solo career.  His genre was of the acoustic singer/songwriter sort, which I personally believe to be a bit exhausted.  No offense, but the world has too many people with a guitar and a decent voice all sounding alike.  Unfortunately, and this seems to happen a lot in Christian circles, everyone is always supportive of everyone, and therefore all people with a voice and a guitar think they should be doing gigs and such, when really there's no need.  It's not entirely unlike pathetic.org, where everyone in the world posts their poetry and everyone compliments it all.  Most of the stuff on Pathetic is, quite simply, pathetic :)  But I digress...

Overflow itself seems to attract a certain, shall I say, Christian-preppy crowd.  For those who don't know me so well, I'm not generally a fan of stereotyping.  However, when I first pulled in the parking lot, and saw a group of approximately 10 males in red baseball caps turned backwards, white t-shirts, and khaki/blue pants... my first thought was that we were at a Fred Durst look-alike party.  I don't feel the need to continue my description of the Christian-prep, for anyone who'd understand what I mean probably already knows what I mean.  That was my general impressive of Overflow, not precisely a social situation for which I hold any particular affinity.  In fact, I felt quite out of place most of the night.

Derek Webb talked about how Christianity had gone ""pop culture"" and become commercialized.  What irony!  He is, perhaps, preaching (I use the word lightly, he really wasn't preaching) to the -most- commercialized group of Christians.  I really agreed with most of what he was saying, and though he wasn't explicit, I picked up on references to some popular books like the Left Behind series and the Prayer of Jabez.  Anyway... in conclusion... don't commercialize religion ;)"

Good Charlotte... good stuff.  Was listening in the car with Nik and Dustin yesterday, I didn't know either of them enjoyed it.  They don't seem like they'd be into that type of music, but alas, there are always surprises.  Speaking of yesterday, I suppose I ought to talk about it some.  Dustin, Nikkie, Katie, and I went to Stone Mountain for a while, then back to D's house to watch Office Space and hang out.  Then Dustin and I took Katie home, and met up with Christina and Steph, went out for some Ice Cream, then came home.

"event","Friday was Corey's rehersal and the rehersal dinner.  It also happened to be the day They Might Be Giants was playing at The Big Rock and Third Day was at On The Bricks.  Anyway, I got up early and picked up Katie for lunch and to hang out a bit, since I wasn't going to see her much with all the wedding crap the following two days.  The rehersal itself was fairly unproductive, but it gave me a chance to tape something, and work with Thob's camera some.  Afterward, we all travelled 20 minutes up 85 to Corey's neighborhood's club house for the rehersal dinner: BBQ.  I thought about ditching the party and heading downtown to hear Third Day, but decided to stay anyway.  Following the dinner, we went back to the church and set up until about 12, when I came home and played around with the camera some more.

Woke up around 10:30 on Saturday, got to the church around 11:30 and started setting up the cameras.  It was a bit awkward at first when the other videographers arrived, but we quickly got to talking and actually exchanged numbers so we could share tape later.  After the wedding (which I went fairly well, with some dry spots), we all went to the reception.  Katie and Christina left almost right away, but Jason and I stayed around a while.  After that, I went home, changed, retrieved Katie from Christina's house, and went to Pleasantdale to help Jason resurrect the sound system for Sunday.

Later that night, Nikkie, Dustin, Katie, my parents, Katie's parents, and Jason went to a concert at El Tecelote (I have no idea how to spell it correctly) right off 78 by Stone Mountain.  Dominic, Katie's guitar teacher, was playing with someone... and they rocked.  I mean completely, hands down, they were awesome.  Katie and I played Kiss Me and Landslide during the intermission, which was greeted warmly... but we really didn't deserve to share the stage with Dominic.  Katie kissed me on the cheek during Kiss Me, which was really sweet.  Anyway... that was a fun night.

Anyway... congrats to Corey and Jenn.  G'night to everyone else."

"event","That was, by far, the best concert I've ever attended.  The seats were wonderful, we had a spectacular view of the stage... no need for binoculars where we were sitting.  They started off with one or two older song, then went into a bunch of the new stuff, starting with Peacekeeper and then Come (my personal favorite track off the new CD).  Then they went into some slower songs, including Landslide, for which I called Katie and let her listen.  A few songs later, they performed I'm So Afraid... for which I called James.  That completely rocked.  As much as the song rocks on the CD... experiencing it live is like nothing else.  Other random highlights include Go Your Own Way and Don't Stop, two oldies for which I've acquired a bit of an affinity.

I particularly enjoyed Lindsey's commentary on some of the new songs, taking a few seconds to explain the meanings.  And, of course, I enjoyed his awesome guitar playing... I'll never get how a rock guitarist can fingerpick :)

"event","Ah, Skynard... good stuff.  This entry will cover the greater part of the last two weeks, so brace yourselves.  In fact, many of you would probably rather skip my semi-coherent rambling in favor of, say, a television show or perhaps a good book.  But, alas, I continue delving into the world of one 18 year old Atlanta area youth.  On an unrelated side note, Mountain Dew and cheese don't mix.

Last Sunday (not yesterday) was spent mostly thinking about random things.  I ended up driving down to Borders for a while to just get out of the house, and then just drove down Peachtree for a while, got some Krispy Kreme, and went home.  I find driving is one of the most relaxing things one can do, and provides a great time to think.  Of course, I spent like 20 minutes on the phone with Bailey and Faith while I was driving... but oh well, talking to them doesn't require much thought anyway :)

Monday was Memorial day... awesome day.  In the early afternoon, Mom and I pick up my graduation present from them: a video camera.  It fricking rocks.  It's a JVC MiniDV camera, and connects to the computer through firewire (muchos better then the SVHS camera and analog capture card).  I absolutely love firewire and DV camera... so fricking awesome.  No more dropping frames during capture, or having to render everything (ah, Premiere makes all this so easy).  I made a short little home movie thing on Memorial Day... you can find it at <a href=""http://caffeinehigh.net/narf/memorialday2.wmv"">http://caffeinehigh.net/narf/memorialday2.wmv</a>.  Dustin already thought I was a lot like Brendan, the lead character from the cartoon Home Movies.  I suppose I reall am, heh, I love this stuff :)

Tuesday... I don't really remember why, but for some reason I met Katie and we hung out most of the day.  Also went to Jason's baseball party, which was somewhat interesting though mostly boring... but hey, it's free food.

Wednesday... met up with Dustin to get some food, pick up Nik, and go back to his place for a while.  Something happened with Nik and I while we were there... but... I don't feel the need to divulge that information here :)  We ended up seeing Bruce Almighty that night with James and Kelli, and then went out to eat afterward at the Atlanta Diner.  Then, of course, we went back to Dustin's house to watch Futurama.  Unfortunately, I had quite a headache though the movie and missed about half of it sitting outside drinking lots of water.  Oh well, the movie wasn't really that good anyway :)

Thursday... Nik, Dustin, Katie, and I had plans to go meet Mchie (Nicole) for Sushi.  Of course, Dustin was grounded, fighting with Nik, and Mchie was sick.  So Katie and I met up and spent most of the day together.  We hung out at her house, then my house, then met Christina for dinner, then went back to her house and watched a Norah Jones DVD (I guess that's as close as we'll come to seeing her live).

Friday... Dustin, Mchie, and I met for dinner and then watched the Blair Witch Project together.  I have to say... that is probably the second worst movie ever (right in front of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"".  While we were eating, we noticed the church next door has ""Holy Ghost Night"" on every last friday from 10PM-2AM, so after the movie we take my video camera and head on over there to produce the ""Holy Ghost Project"".  Of course, just our luck, Mr. Ghost and the rest of the congregation forget to show up, and we end up just parodying the Blair Witch for a while.  Gave me a chance to mess around with B&W filters and contrast/brightness adjustment, though.  I think we're going to make a real parody, something along the lines of ""The Atlanta Bum Project"" talking about being scared of homeless people downtown.  Ah, oh well... good times.

Saturday... helped Corey move in the morning and saw the lasershow that night.  I was reminded of my distaste for all things ""Dixie"" (the lasershow always leaves me feeling that way).  I was somewhat surprised by the lack of 9-11 references in it too.  Ah well, I know I'm not the most patriotic person, but really... patriotism is merely the conviction that your country is better than all others merely because you were born there.  Seems pointless to me.  I think my favorite part was the psychedelic song in the middle... just like back in my early drug years ;) j/k

Sunday... got up early for church to setup/run sound, as always.  I'm starting to get tired of waking up at 6:30 on a weekend (no pun intended).  Had lunch at the church picnic, then went to Christina's graduation party.  After that, went back to Katie's house and watched the old version of the Music Man, which was pretty good.  Last night, Katie said quite possibly the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me... which, of course, will go without repetition here ;)

And now, 'tis Monday."

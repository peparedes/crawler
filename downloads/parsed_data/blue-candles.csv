"event","Soo I decided to write. I'm sick of life honestly. Whats the point of living when every little bit of happiness only leads back to misery. I have no friends, I have no life. I have an amazing boyfriend, who I completly take for granted and don't deserve. I really hate myself. I hate everything about my life. When are things going to be different. Whats wrong with me. Any ideas. Because besides being a complete screwup, I think i'm a pretty decent person. Why is my karma so much worse that other peoples. Did I do something to deserve this. Because if I did, someone up there please fill me in and i'll rectify whatever horrible mistake I made in every way possible. I hurt so bad and I have no one to talk too. I was on top of the world, really I was. And then all of a sudden my boyfriends in jail, i'm drinking and doing drugs all the time again. And I make the worst possible choices you could make. When will I get better?

I have no reason to live. No desire to live. The air I breath enables a completly unwanted existence. Hurt me please. 

Bruise Me, Cut Me, Make Me Bleed, Make Me Suffer. When you think you've tortured me enough. Give Me the Decency of a Quick Death. 

Completely broken with no one to turn too. And still my smile will stay in place. I'm going to shatter soon. </3"

"event","Kay I think its time to write, you may not understand my pain.

The last entry I wrote I said that I met this cute boy right? Hes where my story starts.


His name is Chipper (Austin) && he's in crips, he saw me at a party, heard that I thought he was cute and got my number from his friends. He called me and even though we had never talked before it didnt really seem awkward. His best friend Lee (another crip) and him came over to my house. Lee left to go pick up some people. Me and Chipper sat on the steps for an hour or so and just smoked ciggs and talked. I really liked him. He was easy to talk too, and despite his reputation he was suprisingly gentleman-like. We started hanging out like every day. Jensine being her bitch ass (prolly cause we had been fighting && recently been dumped horribly) even started to flirt with him and he didn't respond. Jensine set her eyes on Lee. Who I thought was nice && fun to be with, but I was pretty focused on Chipper. I admit he swept me right off my feet with his charm and sweetness. He finally asked me out in an incredibly adorable way. We went out for three amazingly happy days, he almost seemed too good too be true && he was. He disapeared. Just vanished. No phone call, nothing. I called him a million times like an idiot. He simply just didnt pick up. The Lee && Jensine thing never even started, he just didnt like her very much. So I tried to forget about them and move on with Jensine.

Right after that I started going to a school called academy. A bunch of druggies and gang members went there. 1st grade work that you don't even much have to do. Automatic A's. A dream come true I thought. I found out that an old friend of mine went there, we started hanging out doin yayo and smoking weed. She knew Lee and hadnt seen him in forever so she persuaded me to call him. Thats where her deception started, I played right into her hand. Then she had me call Lee to get her a ride home in the middle of the night. We weren't even really friends, and Lee could be really mean I heard. I was positive he would say no, he was in the middle of sleeping and he said yes. That was when I started to suspect Lee might like me. We started hanging out, he was just such a fun person to be with. Everything was going pretty good honestly. Then one friday night me and Ashley decided we wanted to roll, since jensine had been getting jealous of me not spending time with her, I decided to invite her. Mistake number two. Lee picked us up, we took the rolls and bout a G of yay. At the time I was feeling so close to Lee that I leaned against him and started rubbing on my back. Jensine noticed this and apparently started talking shit about me to his sister. We dropped Jensine off at 12 and were at Ashleys house by 1.

Me && Lee had been holding hands the whole car ride, and when it was over, I asked him if he wanted to kiss me. I was on alot of drugs and feeling kinda brave. He did of course. Lee was yayed up too. He bought an 8 ball, so did his sister and his sisters boyfriend. While I was at Ashleys house, his sis Debbie took the phone from him told me that she knew me and Lee liked each other and that she liked me and all this shit. Then AShley got in a fight with her mom cuz she was pretty skeeted so we left her house at like 2:30 hiding in the bushes from the cops waiting for Lee to come get us. We spent the whole night doing coke (&& holding hands with Lee under the comforter) Everybody was goin kinda crazy cuz nobody had been to sleep. Lee had to be at work at 7 so he dropped us off at Jensines house till he got off at 12. I asked Jensine if she'd be mad if I dated Lee. She said of course she liked him first. There were rules I KNEW THAT and yet drugs had me in a fucked up state of mind, I just didnt care about her feelings.

So Lee picked us up, && I spent the whole day at his house laying in the bed with him tired as fuck, making out && leaving hickies on each other ;p.. I did really like him though. There was just something that attracted me immensly to him. While I was there Lees sis told me what Jensine said about me (supposedly) so I got mad at her. When she called I picked up and told her I aint wanna speak to her bitch ass no more and hung up. Then while I was chilling with Lee, Debbie(lees sis) was using my phone to send nasty text messages to Jensine, like leave me and my man alone you nasty slut. Thats when I guess she truly found out about me and Lee. That night me her, Ashley, Amanda && Lee were about to get some more white. Even though I didnt have any money. I decided that I didnt want to do any. I found out later Ashley never planned to give me any. Bitch. I decided I didnt want Jensine and of course Lee would agree with me. But Ashley convinced me we needed Jensine, so I made up with her so that it would be bearable. But when we got to our homeboy Fanfans house, Jensine saw Lees hickies and started screaming that she was gonna stick him in his face. (she was skeeted) So I begged Lee to leave because I hadnt slept or eaten in going on 3 days and I just couldn't deal with a fight. 

So we left and went to his house for a while. He asked me if I wanted to spend the night. And of course i'd rather spend the night with him then those 3 fucked up girls skeeted as fuck, staying at some random guys house.I noticed then that Ashley was playing both sides, mine && Jensines. So Ashley called for Lee to come pick them up, Lee didnt even wanna pick them up, I had to beg him not to let them sleep in the streets. So we dropped them off and got back to his house about 4:30 am, I was supposed to be spending the night at Ashleys. We passed out on his couch as soon as we layed down. My mom showed up at his door at 7 am, His mom told me I was never allowed to hang out with him again because I lied to her about being allowed to spend the night. Apparently my mom called Jensine looking for me and Jensine had been so angry she told my mom EVERYTHING. My mom took me home and gave me a drugtest. I came up positive for Cocaine, Exstacy, && Marajuana. I was grounded for a month. My mom talked to Jensines dad and they pretty much figured out everything else about Jensine && Ashley. Jensine went to rehab for 6 months. Of course I got called the snitch. Ironic huh?

Anyways Lee started coming to see me everyday. I liked him alot, he was pretty good to me. While I was grounded Lees friend Justin (yet another crip) got out of jail, we became phone friends, cause he was on house arrest and I was grounded. He flirted with me but I figured he was just fucking around. Then I started to notice Lee would get insanely mad over nothing, and his mood changed frequently. I ignored it though. Then he finally asked me out in another adorably cute way. That friday I decided to jump out my window to go hang out with Lee, Chipper was supposed to catch me, he didn't. We were also supposed to find a ladder so I could get back in, we didnt. Me && Lee had a fantastic night together until we noticed missed calls from my parents at 5 in the morning. I decided I wouldn't go home for a while. So I hung out with him and his friends at his house. He started to get moody and started being kind of mean. He said he had to go because it was Justins lil sis's sweet sixteen party. He had asked me to go the night before but now he was just being mean. I had no where to go && I didnt want to go home. Ashley wasnt helping she was physing him out by telling him poe9 were watching him. The police and my parents had already questioned him. He told everyone we got in a fight and broke up the night before.

Since he was being mean I got my stuff and told him I was leaving, he asked me where and I told him I didnt know and walked out. A normal boy would have came and got me, instead him and his friends got in the car and drove by. Even though I was an hour or so away from my house, with no sleep, only pj's on && no cellphone. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? So I walked to a gas station && called my parents to come get me. Made up some bullshit ass story about having a mental breakdown and jumping out of my window and walking around town all night. The believed it. I was pretty upset but not for the reasons they thought I was. LEe was being kinda stiff to me when I called him later. Then the next day we got into a fight because he was acting angry and mean and wouldnt tell me he was mad at me. I was being nice. Actually really nice. He started screaming at me that it was over, he didnt need no bitch in his life, HE FUCKING CALLED ME RETARDED! He just flipped out on me I dont even know why. But on our 4rth or fifth day of going out it was over just like that. I was heartbroken, not only because I liked him but because he just treated me like a peice of shit on his shoe. I've never been talked to like that in my whole life (not including my dad) by anyone even if I deserved it.

So we stopped talking. The next day Kelly took me to get my stuff. His sisters boyfriend threw my necklace at me and told me to get the fuck out of there. I just could not understand why they were treating me like I was this horrible person when I did nothing but be nice and honestly like Lee. I still talked to his friend Justin who started flirting with me even more. And then finally I went to visit him && I guess he liked what he saw. The next time I talked to Lee was when he called me to tell me I wasnt allowed to talk to Justin. We got in a fight, and then Justin called me on 3-way with Lee and told me we couldnt talk no more. He was only saying that to make Lee feel better though. Lee and me started slowly talking again. That friday me and Ashley decided we wanted to roll again, && I decided I wanted to be hanging out with Justin when I did. Then Lee calls me up asking for rolls and saying he was hanging out with Justin, SO I knew he wanted to chill with me. He came and picked me up at the mall and Ashley and Amanda met us at Justins house. We had to wait forreevverr for the rolls. And Ashley was ALL OVER Lee.. I mean literally, I think you'd have to see it to believe it. And from what I knew from before he did not like her, he only hung out with her when I was around and dodged her calls when I wasnt. I ended up rolling hard that night, and me && Lee started acting like we use to even though Lee wasnt rolling that hard. We had sooo much fun. I didnt take the roll till 11:30 && my parents picked me up at 11:45.. So by the time I got home I was rolling face and got Lee to catch me from my window again.

I ended up spending the night at Lees again. We ended up having sex, it was nice, quick but nice, we cuddled for a long time afterwards, I really liked him. But at the same time I had kind of been flirting with Justin, Justin had even kissed me and everything, even though I didnt kiss him back. I didnt go home right away cuz I didnt want too, I stayed at Justins for a few nights cuz if lees mom caught me at his house she'd kill me. I didnt know what to do cuz Lee went hot and cold with his feelings and I didnt want to completly put Justin to the side. I told Justin that me and Lee def. did not have sex. One night I guess Lee decided to confide in Justin. I was chilling with Ashley getting fucked up. Justin called me and was like sooo Angela did you have sex with Lee or not? I was like uhmmm noo.. and then I hear Lees voice in the back ground saying fucking lying whore. They were both mad at me. I was freaking out, I was having a panic attack and an anxiety attack at the same time, and I was tired of running away I just wanted to be home. So I begged Lee to come get me, he didnt talk to me the whole way back. I knew I couldnt fix this. But Justin wasnt mad at me and we just got closer and closer.

Then one night I was at Justins and Debbie called up Justin screamin at him saying that Ashley told Lee that I had been fucking with Lees head and fucking Justin and Lee and all this shit. Which was not true. All I told her was the night I was rolling, Justin and Lee were laying on both sides of me, justin had his leg wrapped around one of my legs and Lee had his hand on the other one rubbing it. And I was just praying to god that neither of them noticed cuz I didnt want either of them to be mad or upset. OBviously I liked Lee more. But AShley completely twisted it around, made up shit even, she told him that I used him for his car and cuz he bought me ciggs. WTF.. I really liked him. But nobody but Justin believed me. And Eric was mad and getting ppl to try to fight me over summin that Lee, Rubin && Justin started in the first place. Everybody was blowing up my cellphone yelling at me, trying to fight me, Ashley called me a hoe and said she was gonna knock me out and shit but she never showed up.

Me and Justin continued getting close, Really close, we ended up having sex, we could talk about anything together. He was like my best friend. Then my grandma died and I had to go to ATL for a week and then went to JAx for 3 weeks and somewhere halfway through he just stopped talking to me. Now I found out that Lees pretty much going out with Ashley.. OR maybe he really is and Justins like her best friend. She got what she wanted she stole my friends and everyone hates me. Ill write more later.. Im exhausted. havent been to sleep in two days.

Just too damn anxious."

And I was like look why are u telling people all this bullshit to hurt me? If you didnt care about me still then you wouldnt be doing this. Why can't you just grow up and we'll be friends.

And then he called me and was talking to me and was like I never cheated on you I just said that cuz I was mad that u were going out with tony.. And then he was like nothing matters anymore all I do is get fucked up now. Fuck probation, fuck my GED, Fuck my job cuz I quit and all this shit. I felt soo bad.

and then he was still being kind of an ass. But he called me this morning to go riding on his boat w/ him. I couldnt go though. He's still trying to hurt me in small ways. And I know he still cares. I think he thinks I don't care. But I do I do so fucking much!! HE was talking to me about tony earlier and was like when is tony coming down and i started to talk about tony and he freaked out on me he was like I DONT FUCKING CARE!! and I was like damnn then why did you ask, you have a g/f why should you care when I talk about him? And hes like so im not allowed to care? And I was like no your not, not after how you did me and he didnt say anything.

But then earlier he was like im going fishing tommorrow over by where you live in like the middle of a conversation and im SO SO hoping he'll call me and ask me to go. But I dunno if he will b/c I didnt go today.

Also me and tony broke up a lil while ago b/c of something im not saying on here.

I dunno what to i'm loving the wrong type of ppl.. I need to get away from this.. I need a new life, an alias where nobody knows me and I can just start over..

shit like this is really starting to take its toll on me.. I cant sleep at night and when I do fall asleep I dont wake up until really really late, and then im too tired to do absolutly anything and i get so anxious and depressed sometimes I just dont know what to do....."

Lets just say from the last entry me and Andrew ended up getting back together so we were only apart for like 2 or 3 days.. And he stopped talking to Nicole completely.

Lets just say our relationship was FUCKED up!
We always fought. Like literally 24/7.
We cheated on each other.. (i'm not sure he did but hes saying he did now, he could just be mad but whatever I believe him.)
I mean it was horrible.

But through all that I still loved him. 
I mean we had some amazing times.
I love him very much actually.

We broke up wednesday on our 5 month.
I got back with Tony.
He went and got a girlfriend too.
We dont talk anymore or anything.
I miss him SO damn much.
I just don't know what to do.
And its so hard trying to put on this fake ass smile in front of everyone, everyone thinks I don't care, including Andrew.
But I do care, I care so fucking much.
I walk around with my heart in so much pain.
All I wanna do is see him, hold him, kiss him. 
I feel like i'm dieing slowly.

GOD I MISS HIM... and he doesn't even know how much I love him.
But the sad part is I don't think he'd care.

I wrote about it in my journal and told all of my friends but I always acted like I didnt care.
But he just had to get passed that first phase.
I dont like feeling vunerable.
even though now im exposing myself more than ever.

Now his X girlfriend is telling him she loves him and buying him presents and stuff.
ugh.
I just want to fucking smash her pretty little face into the concrete.
She couldnt have fucking waited a bit before jumping all over his fucking dick?

And now he's so confused. Hes with me and then with her and he just doesnt know what to do.

Kay now who would you pick.

#1 girlfriend(me) she doesnt really act like she cares, you fight with her over everything and she breaks up with you 3  times.

#2 girlfriend (her aka stupid slut/whore/bitch)lol who tells you she loves you buys you cute sentimental shit... someone you've gone through everything with and never fought.

Ive been grounded for coming home trashed
and I didnt go to the rave because Andrew begged me not to go
and why not he has a right to not want me to go. I wouldnt want him to go to a club rolling and fucked up but whatever.

Im sick of fighting with him though, and I told him today if he doesnt learn how to trust me then I dont want to be with him. Bottom Line.

Anyways Sunday when I was getting trashed I was hanging out with Phillipe, Janea, Chris, Jensine, Zac oh and Shaunn too. I love Janea and Chris and I guess they like me cuz they always want me to come chill and talk to me on the phone and were so mad when I canceled on the rave.

Tuesday I hung out with Katy and 4 of her friends. Lets just say her friends aren't my cup of tea. The wash out Bright green and blue in there hair and the colored contacts just seem a lil Jr. highish to me. But maybe its just me.

Wednesday Jensine came over before work and then I decided to let her go for me. Phillippe was there too, then Zac and Andrew came but they couldnt chill for long. Then after they left Kelly came and chilled for a while. Her new pitbull Kalua is sooooooo cute.

Then today Phillipe andrew and Zac picked me up we chilled ran some errands and smoked a blunt and then they dropped me off.

Tommorrow im not working but Im waking up at like 10 to get all cute to see Andrew, getting my paycheck and going to the mall to get my nails filled and hopely Andrew will be home by then.

My Baby will finally be home tommorrow =) 
Hopefully everythings okay.
Because if this relationship gets fucked up too, then guess what?
I GIVE UP! Im goin lesbian.. ok well maybe not but you get the point.

How adorable right but Andrew would kill me the outfits see through and its a thong bathing suit. Jensines wearing a hot pink thong bathing suit with the same outfit, Janeas wearing a electric blue thong bathing suit with the same outfit. Were all wearing white visors with our hair straightened and in pig tails. I have black open toed lace up heels Jensine has regular black heels and Jenaes wearing black boots. Were getting all glittery and make-upey and have passies and glow sticks its gonna be great!

But im definitly gonna get caught.
I hope its worth it.

"event","Kay time to REALLY update.

Ive been hanging out with Jensine ALOT. She's like my best friend now. I love hanging out with her, shes so much fun. And she's already my ride or die girl. Even though me and Brandii have been best friends since we were 6 it took us 6 or 7 years to get to the point me and Jensine are.

Anyways so we'll start 3 weeks ago cuz thats all I can member at the moment.

So me and Jensine wanted a ""girls day out"" So we decided to go to the mall. And then my homegirl called me and asked if we wanted a half O so we were like yea! So we decided to go back, we got on the WRONG bus like a dumbass. So we were a million miles away from home and we decided to hitch a ride back. We finally got back and walked to my homegirl Chelseas house. It was SO hot and we were so tired. Then we went up and had Gabe roll us a blunt and smoked. Went back to my house and Leddie (Jensines ol' man) called and was like i'm coming over to chill and i'm bringing a friend. His friends name is Ray.

We all chilled and smoked and drank (except for Ray cause he dont smoke.) Then Ray started acting kinda shady and was like I gotta go and dropped us off. I was like wtf? But like 10 min. later I get a phone call from Leddie and he was like Ray wants to holla he was only acting shady cuz he thought you had a man. So I was like yea lets hang out tommorrow.

I g2g i'll finish later I just realized imma be late for work"

He brushed the hair out of my eyes.
Held me so the waves wouldn't knock me over.
Rubbed my arms and cheeks.
Made me warm when I was cold

And the big thing is he wasn't just trying to ""get some.""
     Or maybe he was and i'm just unaware?
But he didnt try to kiss me or rub me in a ""i want sex"" kinda way.

and he's not a coral springs boy.. yay!

       but i dunno i've lost all my trust and respect when it comes to boys.
 
           I just can't trust him and I don't.

 We'll see.


            Today was a good day. I'll explain later."

So friday right after school I went to the mall with Kelly, it was so much fun. She made me listen to this song that was out when I was a kid, C'est la vie or summin by bewitched, at first I was embarressed but then I started to have fun just being silly girls! I bought a cinnamon pretzel and blue rasberry slushie from Auntie Annes yumm. Then she dropped me off and my friend Chelsea and her home boys picked me up, we went and smoked, drank a few beers and played cards. They were really nice, kinda dorks and pretty ugly but i like them lol.

Saturday I went to work all day, all day I waited for Juliet to call me cuz we made plans and she wasn't picking up my calls. When i finally did get ahold of her she was drunk as fuck and was like oh yea sorry. I was pretty mad. (oh yea I want nothing to do with Ray because after i left on saturday he was like Juliet why didnt that girl jump on my dick? I was like WTF!! so thats OVER!) Anyways so I called Kelly and I was pretty mad cuz it seemed like in a way she fucked me over. So kelly came and picked me up and we went to her homeboy Andrews house. Who btw is sooo cute. We decided to go to a bar to play pool. I ended up having to sit in his lap cuz there were so many people in the car. He's a sweetheart and we shared a beer lmao <33 At the pool hall there were like 20 million people that met us up there. We got kicked out of the first one because of these stupid preps that met us up there.

Because they were acting so young, I mean I literally hear one of them say ""OMG, i could like see my mom here"" So we went to Hustlers and thankfully on the way they got lost and didnt try to find us. Me Andrew, Christina, these 2 boys and 2 other girls smoked and then we went to play pool, I actually had alot of fun! BTW Andrew is single! And he told me I had pretty eyes <33 eww la la ! 

Sunday I did a whole lotta nothing and enjoyed it like hell! 

Monday and Tuesday Jensine came to work with me cuz Hannys getting fired and shes gonna start work there so im training her. Then we came home ate and chilled. Plus this boy I met at the gas station called me twice and I might chill and smoke with him this weekend! Hes really cute! Buuutttt I forgot his name lmao!

 Maybe this weekend i'll get to hang out with Andrew, he seems like a real sweetheart <3
 
But I might be going to Lehigh and spending the night at Justins =) Thats if my parents say yes.
     And two things
-I might not be going to Jax this summer... KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED FOR ME!! 
-I might be moving to Ft.Myers.. Im not sure whether thats a good or bad thing since I hate it here i dunno

           I need love <333"

I know I havent written in a long time but I felt like I was finally getting my life back and I didnt want to jinx it by writing about how good it felt.
But now its all back to the same SHIT!
Ohh btw there are gonna be alot of pics in this entry or maybe the next.

Anyways so I was hanging out with Jensine Alot, shes become one of my best friends now :) We've smoked together and chilled together and we also have a daily routine and our very own notebook. I love her very much.

I cant stand Joe now most of the time because he acts like such a lil bitch but I dont wanna get into that, it makes me mad! But sometimes I couldnt love him more. I dunno its a weird love hate relationship.

Me and Gabe dont hang out anymore :( I dont know why.. one day we just stopped talking its kinda crazy. The last time I hung out w/ him was on 4/20 and me and a couple of his friends smoked.

I also started hanging out with kelly again and her best friend Juliet.

Brandii and Felix have there own place now (she got kicked out). I've decided not to move there but I will be there this summer to take care of her though!

I got a new job at a drycleaners I love it, I hang out w/ hanny almost every day now and her adorable lil nephew.

Kay well thats all I can remember even though soooo much more shit has happened.

Three weekends ago I went and visited my 3 best friends and Justins best friend in Lehigh. I spent the night there with Jemma, Justin, Justin and Justin. lol. I LOVE them. We got so high and drunk and didn go to sleep for two days and I ended up liking Justins best friend! I stole his shirt haha! (dont worry he knew lol)

Then 2 weekends ago My best friend and his best friend came up from lehigh we had alot of fun! I love them sooo much and soon after that I started goin out with Justin.

Then last weekend I finally went with Juliet to meet Ray her boyfriends bestfriend who they have been trying to hook me up with forever. Unfortunatly I dont remember meeting him on friday lol. He  didnt get off work till 9 and me her and Pat started smoking and then drinking and she took like 3 or 4 regular shots and me and Pat took like 8 or 9 double shots and hadnt eaten since thursday afternoon. So about the time I started throwing up he showed up. And then I guess I went to sleep on the couch. I dunno I don't remember. Angela makes the best first impressions doesnt she. lol

Then we went and picked up my best friend cuz he came up here and we went home and went to sleep, I was so drunk lol. 

Then saturday I took Justin to work with me and then we went to the mall and I bought a new bellybutton thing and got my nails done then I chilled with him and Chris(his friend that was taking him back.) After he left :( I watched cinderella with hilary duff, such a cute movie! Finally then Ray and Juliet picked me up. And yes he is pretty cute I think, we drank and smoked but we didn like talk at all. I dunno i didnt get the nicest impresion of him but then again he didnt get the nicest impression of me either im sure. Im going there again saturday, I think?

Ohh yea I broke up w/ Justin he just lives too far away.

And now I feel sooo lonely again, i just dont know how to explain it."

Watching Ishmael and Hanny(my married friends) together makes me feel that.
I miss that feeling more than anything.
Its almost been a year now and nothing has even come REMOTELY close to anything that feels like it.
It really disheartens me, will I ever feel it again.

You know nobody knows how I feel, everybodys like oh its been a year shes okay now.
But NO IM NOT. I still love him and miss him with all my heart and soul. I still think about him EVERY single day, all I want is to see him walk through my door and say Im Home Baby. It was never over for me and still isnt. I wish I had told him that instead of telling him I didnt care. God I love him so much.

Ill write about my week later."

"event","Some people are sluts hah. But im not mad I actually consider it kinda funny and immaturish, Good thing I had a change of heart. I feel much better.
Anywaayyyss
Yesterday I literally slept ALL day. Then today I had to get up at 11:30 even though I went to sleep at like 9 am.
I went to see Miss Congenialty with my parents goood movie.
Then I went on a walk and called Gabe and hung out with him for an hour or two and he got me some ciggs.
Tommorrow is his Bday so I got him a card and burned a CD of mine that he really liked.

I realized I didnt like him and I feel so much better because of it. I was pretty confused back then. I confused liking the fact that I had someone to talk too down here finally with actually liking him.
I feel so much better and not so guilty too.
Though I could be convincing myself that I dont like him because I dont wanna like him.
Thats Angela's way, push away the people you love if you dont feel right about something. LoL 

I hope he has time to hang with me 2morrow cause I know he's got plans it being his b-day and all.

BTW did I tell you E's in jail ? Thats why he hadnt called me in forever hes been locked up. How sad. :( I reaaalllyyy miss talking to him.

Marcus confessed that he really likes me, honestly I dont like him that way.

I dont know what im looking for and it kinda sucks, I dont think i'll ever find that person im searching for..."

"event","Hello all.
Heres a review of my week..

When I was at school it was goin pretty good, I missed my friends sooo much. Theres like such an unspoken tension between me and Gabe, its pretty weird.

Tuesday I found out that this poem I wrote that my mom made me enter in a contest is a semi-finalist. I know i'm not gonna win but its pretty cool for something that took me like 5 secs to write.

Friday night we left for jacksonville and got there around 1:00.. Saturday morning I met my grampa Johnny. Its really weird. Then at 12 I went 2 Brandii's and we walked too The woods. It was soo much fun I missed my friends. We smoked some dirrtys and drank a few quarts. Millers high life.. yummy! Then I dropped her off at work and went out to dinner with my aunt, uncle, three cousins, grampa, parents, moms best friend and her daughter. Mann I was soo high and they were all staring at me, it sucked.

Then we went to CD warehouse and I got 3 CD's:
1] Bone thugs n harmony: greatest hits
2] Krazyie bone- gemini good vs evil
3] Tupac- the rose that grew from concrete
    I lovveee Krazyie bone !!!!

Then went and picked Brandii up from work and she walked out crying cause she got fired cause she went into work so high. Then we went back to the hotel chilled in the hottub, worked out(for like 2 secs till I was tiredLMAO) and went too bed.

Sunday we went back over to her house than got dropped off at The woods again and met up with brandiis ol man we got 2 quarts and then another 2 then I met up with my big bro and we went to this chicks house to smoke. Then I left and Justin and Jemma and Chaos came OMG I Love them. Then big bro came back I was pretty drunk cause we drank some more I feel asleep on my bro hah. OMG brandii started humping lix in publix in front of all these people.. i was like dieing laughing, and Lix was like omg no more drinks for you! lol then my mom picked me up she was mad i was all stumbling and shit and she was like you smell like beer.Then shane, jemma and justin came 2 my hotel 2 chill. Poor shane he still aint got no looks goin 4 him but hes still a major sweetheart and is still so in love w/ me lmao..
Look Pics in Jax! ~>(i did have ALOT more cute ones but stupid jemma accidently erased them. errrr

We use to be something so beautiful.

I still love him though he'll never know.

Even though I said I wasn't gonna have a boyfriend for a while, being lonely is definitly taking its toll.

I wish I could find someone like him and be something beautiful again."

Its been okay I guess besides being bored and lonely :(

I went to my first 2 Saturdays of class. It was really gay, I got there at 8 and we watched movies from the 80's about criminals and shit for four hours. The second time I was pissed because I was ready to go and at the last minute we remember that I have to take my drug test. SO I have like a minute to pee and their screaming at me to hurry up and banging on the door. So I couldnt go. LMAO. So I went to the class and I told my dad to let me talk to my PO and he barges in and is like SHE COULDNT GO in front of all my classmates. I HATE him. And the sad part about is he thinks humilating me is funny.

Anyways so I havent done much. 

Friday I heard voices outside my door and I look out and Gabe and Steven and some other kid are sitting there. That made me smile. I love talking to Gabe.
Btw he's the one I like...shhh...

I got two new pairs of shoes.. 1 that I paid for.. 1] Lugs all white birdman's
                                                   2] Hightop Iversons
It sucks though cause I had to go to the kids footlocker to find a pair of Iversons that fit me and their still too big.. So are the birdman's.
I also got my nails done with royal blue tips.. prettyyy

Im really tired today, it was my first day back to school, I was really excited to see my friends. I was sad at lunch cause Gabe wasnt there, but at the end of lunch he showed up and I think he was looking for me. His dad dropped him off late.

He was sposed to come over today at 3:45 but I dunno what happened. I think hes scared of my dad cause my dads so rascist.
And I told Gabe today about how my dad and me got in a fight and he was like if any more niggers show up at my house imma shot em. LOL
WOW I really honestly hate him.

On a good note though, im going to jacksonville Saturday to meet my Grampa  and I get 2 stay with Brandii.. but its sad cause shes gonna be working most of the time. Imma get soooo BlAzEd ! hah lol

           Anyways imma go but ill WmL

Guess what?
I like someone.
Like really like someone.
Like when he comes around I get so nervous and dorky. HAH.
Which is funny considering who he is.

I knew how much I liked him when I hung up the phone with a huge grin on my face when my friend told me he doesnt come to lunch anymore cause i'm not there.
LOL how adorkable. LMAO

Im retarded. Retarded and confused. 

Liking him goes against everything I believe in.
If only one thing was different then liking him wouldnt matter but it isnt so it does.

it really sucks.
Its weird cause I could end up regretting this for a long time if I dont do something or regretting it if I do.

 I dont know what to do :(

Well it doesnt really matter im grounded for 2 months so that should give me some time to think. But I really dont think im gonna tell him and its sad.

  GOD hes sposed to be physic and read my mind so he doesnt put me through this! LOL 
He has no clue ahh what should I do ???

"event","Okay i'm going to try to make this short because I dont know when my dads coming home..

Kay this is what happened on Friday..

Im sitting in third period and Juliet is breaking up weed on her desk like a complete dumbass.. she puts some in a piece of paper to give to this kid Bronson sitting next to her, the teacher comes up and takes the paper thinking its a note. Only when she opens it she gets a big suprise! (very funny moment!!) So while shes calling security Juliet passes me the weed and a couple of blunts to hide for her. So like a good (&stupid) friend I take it. Everyone is talking about Juliet getting arrested by lunch, EVERYONE also knew I had the weed. In lunch before I could pass it off security comes to get me. I was caught with 17.8 grams, 2.2 more grams and it would have been a felony (thankgod) a pack of ciggerettes 3 blunts and 2 lighters.
I was handcuffed and taken to Juvie where they booked me, stripped searched me took all my stuff including my bra (wtf) and put me in a cell. I sat there for 4 hours before my mom could come get me. I slept most of the time. lol

I am grounded for 2 months, I did not get my car, as a matter of fact my dad is now using the money to buy him a truck. He also bought me a camara phone which I will nwever get. I no longer have a phone at all. I dont have my laptop either. Im using the living room comp. I am not allowed to leave my house. I cant do anything, I am so lonely I have no one that I can talk too, im not allowed. Im suspended for 2 weeks and pending investigation I might be expelled. They think im serving in the school. I also got a tobacco citation.. again ugh.

After I got out friday I saw Gabe, while my dad was at my moms work I got to talk to him for a few mins that made feel alot better.

Saturday we went to go pick out my dads new truck, I was pissed.

Sunday I did absolutly nothing.

Monday I sat up at my moms work Steven came and sat with me for a while and gave me a couple of newports. (I need some SO SO bad, I have no way of getting them now:( Then when he was leaving I told him to tell Gabe to come over there if he saw him. 2 seconds later Gabe comes over there with Julian that was even better! Then my mom ran them off I HATE her sometimes I swear. We went to an Italian restraunt at night, it was fun you can color on the table on a paper tablecloth, they give you crayons.

Today I went to court I met my PO officer.. I will not be going to jail, they've decided to give me a second chance. Even though I have previous arrests so I shouldnt be allowed. They think im a good kid :D.. God sometimes I love how sweet and innocent I look!! So I have a class I have to attend every Saturday, Im on probation I have to be in at 7 on weekdays and 8 on weekends(not that that matters with my parents). I have to be on school on time every day as well as attend every day. I will have to do community service and also bootcamp for a weekend. For the smoking citation, I owe $100, which sucks considering I just payed them $75 for the last one. I also get my liscense suspended until im 18 and have to attend another class on saturday.. All my saturday classes are 4 hours each. I have to take random drug tests, go to drug counsling and family counsiling classes so im just fucked and basically I hate life right now. Especially since Brandii is not allowed to come down here, and im not allowed to go up there for spring break. I am reallllyy realllyy upset about that one. I miss Jacksonville so much that it hurts.

But I did read a REALLY GREAT book today ;D... i'm trying hard to keep in good spririts.

 Definitly g2g everyone send me some love so when I can check this thing occasionally I have something to look forward too. LOVE you guys.. smooches Angela"

I have been sleeping so much lately so now I am very awake. Plus I just got done watching The Grudge O.O wierd movie.

Yesterday I slept all day, literally. I don't know whats wrong with me.

Today I went to my phychiatrist and she made me take this 467 question personality test. It had weird questions like... Do you believe people are out to get you?... Do you hear voices no one else hears?... Is someone trying to poison you?.. hmm maybe she thinks imma skitzo. Heh.

Then my dad took me to The Pancake House because it was really early. Then we went to a carlot, we're prolly trading in my mustang this saturday and getting me this used Kia, its a little SVU. Its pretty nice for a first car, since the Mustang doesnt count, I never drove it. Then came home around 1 and I went to sleep since I got none last night.

Then at around 6:30 my dad's father called who ive never talked to in my life. (he just started calling after 15 years of not calling or writing and walking out on my grandma, aunt and dad.) He was like well sweetheart do ya know this is your grand dad! i was like okaaayyy, and I care because? I dunno it was weird. Then I took a shower and was gonna go out but my mom got here with food and we sat down to watch the movie. So I havent really done anything lately. 

SO now I have no cigs eeerrrr. I have to go get some tommorrow.

Jerome (the kid on the bike) called me around 12 to ask me to meet him at the players club park at 1. So I walked up there and this guy in this nicceeee Porsche smiles at me so I smiled back. And then he turned around pulled into the lakeview shopping plaza and waved for me to come over there. He was like 40 how gross. So he pulls into a parking spot and smiles at me as I walk by. And then I cross the street and he turns around crosses the street and pulls into an apartment complex and parks and watches me. Im freaking out by now... Then I walk into the park where NOBODY is there and he pulls into the park and I start freaking out, Im thinking that im about to die. So I call Jerome and I was like please hurry up some scary guy is stalking me, and hes like i'll be there in 2 seconds. Well after I get off the phone the guy tears out of there real fast. I was like THANK GOD!!! whew close one.

Anyways after that scary episode I met Jerome hes really nice. Hes 19, has a 4 year old daughter and is down here visiting his sister from Boston. I went over to his house had a few beers and some vodka, then went home. Then my parents left to go to the Jimmy Buffet concert and he called me so I came back over there and smoked with him. I saw Gabe and Julian today too, I want to hang out with them again it was fun.

"event","wellll hello everyone, i just woke up so bear with me. 

Yesterday started off bad but ended good. I was supposed to go to Joeys to smoke with him and Jenson, so I woke up at 1 and waited ALL day for him to call me because he doesnt have a cellphone and they never answer there house phone. I could have been hanging out with other people but because of him I waited.

 Im pissed me and joey are done being friends. I cant stand him anymore anyways. So im going over to his house today getting my shirt that he has and my $5 he borrowed back. Fucking little bitch. 

Aaaannnnyyyways when I finally realized Joey was not gonna call I text messaged Marcus cause we were sposed to hang out today and he came over. I think hes really cute and sweet ! I gotta get to know him better though. 

Yesterday I was walking down the street and some kid on a bike saw me and stopped and was like how old are you? I was like 16. Oh Do you have a boyfriend? No. Really! Can I get your number? Sure. Do you wanna hang out?!! haha some people know how to make you feel good without realizing it. Yea but that was pretty funny!

 Today i'm going job hunting! hooray i'll finally have money again !!

                  Well g2g <3333 Angela"

Saturday- Derick came over and hung out!
Sunday- Was my day in Mourning so to speak.. It was me and Tonys anniversary. I had hoped I wouldnt be sad but as soon as it turned 11:30 am Saturday night I was already depressed. I miss him. The old him. ahhhh
Btw I talked to his cousins best friend who I havent talked too in forever. Tonys back in Pensacola so apparently he's not with Carmin. I dont know why I still bother caring though.
Monday- I woke up in an okay mood, and then it got worse because Valentine sucks when you don't have someone you really love to share it with. But I got homemade valentines from a bunch of my friends that I love even more than storebought ones cause there unique. I also found out I have 4 F's 2 D's and a C in school blahh. And found out that Derick likes me alot, it was so cute and that Tay-Tay who btw is only 14 has a crush on me lmao!
Tuesday- I stayed home from school because ive gone everyday for like a month and its killing me! SO since I wouldnt go to school my mom wouldnt let me do anything.
Wednesday- I talked to E all day and went to dinner with just my dad, it wasnt half bad.
Today- Was a pretty good day Me and my friends took these crazy pictures I cant wait to get them developed! haha and I busted my ass today because Jenson jumped up for me to catch her and she tripped and landed on me instead and I went down on the ground really hard it was funny as hell. School has actually become quite fun. Then after school we did the MC hammer dance Du na na na na da da cant touch this... lmao Then I came home and slept!!!!!! I havent actually slept for more then a couple of hours all week ive been sooooooo tired lately and i still am. Then went and visited my friend at work, got a pack of cigs and came home. I am so extremely tired but like usaul cannot go to sleep at night. 

Brandii's coming in 2 weeks :D We are gonna have a huge hotel rolling/smoking/drinking party... no yayo though so thats good. But Brandiis still pregnant.. What can I say im not her mother shes gonna do it regardless atleast I can moniter her.

One of my friends from school just got an abortion thats so horrible how can you kill your child, it makes me so sad just thinking about it. ;(

I think im in way over my head as of now and its time to stop talking about serious matters and keep it to myself. I guess you cant really talk to anyone.

anyways I have to go clean my room now .....Ta Ta my loveys...."

God  i get so sick of this place sometimes..
E called me today but my mom took my away my phone last night so I only got a message( a very sweet message!) and I called back later when I got my cell phone but he was already gone :(
And it really pisses me off because I was supposed to meet someone today and I showed up late so either he didnt come or he wouldnt wait, how annoying I really wanted to talk to E so i missed his call and walked far for no reason ughhh!!

Yesterday was pretty okay, this kid named Tay-Tay came home with me and then at 4:15 we met up with Gabe and then he went and got his friend Julian. Then we rode across town to go to Tay-Tays, I felt so young being on the back of a bike lmao.. then we went and hung out with other kids (all good people!) We smoked a little bit and walked around it was actually pretty fun.. Then Gabes dad came and got us.. Gabes so sweet though, when he was introducing me to his homeboy and his boy was like oh do you smoke, and I was like yea, so he looked at me like they do all the lil hoes that follow them around just to smoke and was like oh yea, and then gabe put his arm around me and goes naww shes not like that, theres more to this girl then you even know..
he says sweet stuff all the time.. whatta cute kid lol

So anyways tommorrow Gabes fighting this kid at the fair and I get to go and watch this kid get his ass beat yay !! lol

My mom made me go see a shrink today, i think shes worried about me. It was alright I have to go once a week though, ugh..

E's been at his friends house in Orange Park so he hasnt been able to call me, I miss talking to him :(

Ive been hanging out with Gabe alot lately he is just so adorabley cute!! I had the hugest crush on him at the beginning of the year but then I found out he was younger than me and I was like whoa back up ! lol But I dont think that matters to me anymore because the more I talk to him the more I like him, he is so incredibly mature, like more mature than all my ex's put together and their all like 18 or 19 and stuff. God hes so damn cute that I cant help but flirt with him.. I know alot of girls that like him, but I think he likes me he is one of the sweetest boys ive ever met and one of the most gentlemen like too. Ahh and again with the cuteness.. plus he looks 19 ;P

Anyways gotta go cause im soo tired, plus the F-cats 2morrow.. ugh..

Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired and I felt it for awhile now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old
It's four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

And won't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright lit city
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there to so you can see
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
And we'll drink and dance the night away

As long as you're alive
Here I am
I promise I will take you there

I have three people close to me having babies..
2 of my VERY BEST friends.. and my best friends sis who considers me her sister cause i've known her just as long.. ahh its so cute, kinda bad but still cute..
Im gonna be an auntie x3
I miss being an aunt, tonys neice Traciana called me Auntie Angela cause I took care of her so much I miss that little girl :(

Thats Tracie ^ I remember the first night she stayed the night at my house cause her aunties and uncle were soo tired of her lol. She may look cute but shes a badass lil girl! I put her in one of my sleep shirts, it was so adorable cause it was so big on her that it went past her feet lol. It was like 12 and I was wondering how I was gonna get her into bed cause she was running around. So I was like hey tracie wanna watch a movie with Auntie? she was like yea! She came and laid down and fell asleep in like 2 minutes on my shoulder. i couldnt move cause I didnt want to wake her. It was such a beautiful moment.. 

Anyways monday me and my friends got in fight with these nerds..
Why are you attacking me?
Your dissing me in front of my friends!
and then we got in trouble.... Completely hilarous!

Tuesday I found out Danielle had been in the hospital :0
That scared me alot, what would I do without her, it made me realize how lost i'd be without her.. I got to hang out with Joey though and I love him soo much!!

Wednesday I got in a fight with my teacher and he had me escorted out by security, so now I have ISSP for 3 days stupid fucker.. 

Thursday was kinda funny, me Juliet and Jenson, ran around getting money from ppl (i'm talking about quarters and stuff lmao) so that we could get a quarter and smoke on Friday.

Friday was such a bad day I hurried up and got ready so I could get to school early and my fucking dad takes his sweet time even though I told him to be ready early and I get there late any way. Ugh I can't stand him, so I didnt get to smoke my weed and I had ISSP which is where you sit in chairs all day no desk, you cant get up, can't sleep, can't work on classwork or read or draw. Its SO STUPID! and I have it monday and tuesday too, and tuesday is Mardigras and I really wanted to be with my friends and have fun! errr.. It was really boring, my knees were acting up which they always do when its cold outside, I was able to walk up to the store where i hung out with Tony and Gabe and then I couldnt move at all so I layed down and watched I Robot and went to sleep early.

Today is going to be boring, my knees still hurt and im soo tired even though I went to sleep early, I feel so Blah today maybe i'll go to the mall or something.. If my knees feel better..

Ohh yea me and E having been getting along so great, its funny how we get along so well and he told me that he really likes me and wants to be with me, I told him I didnt know. The truth is I like him alot, but I want to wait before jumping in headfirst like I did with Tony.
 
        well anyways i g2g get dressed. x0x0 Angela"

"event","hello, I know i haven't written in a while but i've been pretty busy... Heres whats been going on the past couple of weeks.. On the 19th I started going out with Eric, I hung out with him that whole week, then that weekend I went to the keys again but it was alright this time cause michelle and mellissa were there and I like them alot we have alot of fun together! Then when I got back Monday night Eric had a bouqet of flowers waiting for me.. It was adorable.. So I hung out with him all that week and then on friday Eric brought me over a bouqet of roses and the sweetest card ever... we went out to eat with his bestfriend and his girlfriend who btw I love so much cause she is so pimp and were so much alike.. and then Saturday night we all went to the beach and had so much fun cause on the way back we decided to sing love songs out the window to people I was like literally hanging all the way out the window it was so much fun! Honestly the only reason i've been going out with him is because i've felt so lonely lately..lol.. Our relationship doesnt compare to me and tonys and it never will. Hes so good to me & then he flips and he is the biggest asshole you'll ever meet, all he does is bullshit and lie.. yea in the end it didnt work out, like I figured. itll tell u why later. Then on sunday I got a horrible phone call... My best friend got raped it was soo horrible she was crying so hard and I felt so bad like it was all my fault.. because we've been best friends since she was adopted at 6 yrs old and im sposed 2 protect her and I always have but this time I couldnt cause I wasnt there, my heart was literally broken I cant hear her like that.. So Eric asked if I wanted to go up there and I said yes cause I had to take care of her she was a mess.. He paid for my plane tickets and I went up there and spent all weekend taking care of her... Jemma and Justin came over to her house for a bit, I had missed them soo much, then on Sunday my ""big bro"" came and picked both of us up and we went to his house I missed him sooooo much !! We ended up smoking all weekend like literally! I hadnt done that in a while but me and Eric keep getting in these stupid little fights cause hes an ass and then monday night he pissed me off so bad we broke up.. Were still really really good friends though and we kinda still act like boyfriend and girlfriend he keeps asking me out, but I dont know I still love tony, plus I dont know whats gonna happen with me and Tony and I DONT want to hurt him and the fact is I dont like him that much! Thank god im moving back to Jax this summer, I get to move in with my sis Brandii yayayay  I luvz her! anyways this wednesday Derick took me to a movie and then we hung out, I like chillin with him I hes so supportive and he understands me but theres nothing between us cept friendship.. Then Thursday Joey spent the night so that was alot of fun and harrison (a new friend) chilled with us for a while. Today Harrison picked me and Joey up and we went to hang out with Amanda (this cool ass chick from my school) and harrisons girlfriend.. Me amanda and Joey smoked and then my mom came and picked us up and dropped Joey off at home and took me home.. after that eric christine and Jason came and picked me up and we went back to Erics house.. Tommorow is going to be so much fun cause Eric and Jason are picking me and christine up and were putting makeup, and girl clothes and we get to do there hair and nails its gonna be so much fun!! and then were going to the beach at night.. anyways g2g ttyl"

"event","Hello everybody :D! Everything has been a little better... I've talked to Tony a couple of times and hes not moving up here. I understand though.. but w/e I really dont want to talk about him anymore.. so besides that everythings been alright I hang out with Joey like every day and chill with other ppl and stuff.. uhmm like 3 weekends ago I went to Seaworld cause my parents dragged me there but it turned out to be straight cause I met this girl named Michelle whos cool as hell. Then 2 weekends ago I went to the keys which was fun cause it was so nice up there and I met this hot ass boy named Jessie whos lives in palm beach ! Then last weekend I was really sick but I still went out with Eric and Joey.. Eric took us to outback and paid for us.. He is such a sweetie!.. He likes me (and I think I might have a crush on him but shhh !!) lol I know im not ready to be with anyone yet cause of Tony Blah! Anyways I felt so pretty cause I had on this pink skirt and a pink off the shoulders shirt with pink high heels on and my hair was curly.. When I walked outside Erics mouth dropped open and he was like wow lol.. Anyways this wednesday I went on a date with this kid named Derick.. he took me to the movies and we saw some stupid movie but it was scary and it scared the shit outta me so he put his arm around me when I was scared it was cute.. and then when we went back to the car he opened my door for me and everything then at the end when he dropped me off I thought he was all gonna try and make out with me but he didnt he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek it was adorable and then he asked if he could take me  out to a nice restraunt today but I went out with Eric and Joey instead and we went to Erics house and watched a movie and ordered pizza.. he has nooo clue that I have a TEENY TINY crush on him now and I dont think imma tell him... Anyways tomorrow I have a lunchdate with Derick and then at night im going out with Joey, Eric, samantha & christina sooo I better get some sleep !! soo ta ta for now !"

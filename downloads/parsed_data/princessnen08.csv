"event","I invited this guy over to watch a movie tonight. I'm a little nervous about it because it's only the second time we've hung out.  Sarah told Lisa I was an idiot for inviting him over because I'm just ""leading him on.""  How do I know that I'm leading him on? Maybe I'll really enjoy hanging out with him.  Maybe I won't.  But I'll never know unless I actually hang out with him.  Does this make me an idiot?  All my roommates will be home tonight, which I liked so that I wouldn't be alone with this guy, but now I'm not sure.  I just feel like they are going to make fun of me.  Is it really this hard to hang out with a guy?"

"event","we are so alike and so meant for each other on so many levels.  I understand we can't be together but why is all the simpler stuff so complicated. I am a girl. You are a boy. We are friends. Such a simple concept yet there are so many forces that try to prove otherwise.

I'm hurt and each set back is just adding depth to the wound. How much longer am I to be cut? I was talking to a friend here at school today and she simply said ""I wish I could heal you."" Most people would have wished they could help me but she saw past the superficial pain and saw straight to my raw ache. The phrasing caught me off guard but it has stuck with me all day. It brings me comfort as I lay here in bed that just across campus is a friend who honestly knows what I am going through and aches with me. Knowing that, I feel less alone, which eases the pain."

"event","I love that there are apps for everything! Basically I can update livejournal from my phone by touching a button. I can do all of my updating from my phone now, which means maybe I'll update more haha.  Usually I have all these ideas while I'm out, things I want to share, but by the time I get home I forget everything.

So experiment: let's see if I actually do update :p"

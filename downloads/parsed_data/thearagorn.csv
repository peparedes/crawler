"event","This is the new site for a little magazine that I help produce. It took a day out of my weekend to build it (the site) and weeks of my life to produce it (the magazine). I am really happy with this issue as I actually -like- my writing in this issue (rather than tolerate it) and continue to hope that it (the content of the magazine) finds a home in the minds of (future) friends.

"event","I have a couple new projects that I don't want to announce before they get off the ground but would like to get some help with. Asking for help has never been easy for me and trying to attract people to ""spotlight"" projects (like writing) has met with mixed success. I'm not sure if this method is public enough to reach all the people who might be interested or provides enough context to be appealing to who I'd like to reach but I will give it a try...

Oh, I guess a little.

What is new with Little Black Cart - October 2007


<p>Little Black Cart continues to be a project of anarchist distribution. We carry more than a few things anarchists and their friends should find interesting. Everything we carry we enjoy, most of it we agree with and the rest we disagree with gently. We continue to be inspired by the poetry of action and the energy of our friends to stay committed to the project of transforming the world even when hope no longer holds even ironic appeal.</p>

<p>The past few months (since our last update) have been busy. We have picked up a few new anarchist publishers, have been to Canada, and are starting a few new projects.</p>

<strong>We Have Your Red Hot Slingshot Organizers</strong>

<p>We are now the most convenient way (besides moving next door) to get the pocket-sized or spiral-bound calendar that reminds you about birthdays, anniversaries, and when Emma Goldman was born. They come in crazy colors and have enough space to write in all the tasks in your busy days. <a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/category/publisher/slingshot/ "">http://littleblackcart.com/category/publisher/slingshot/</a> </p>

<strong>Our First Paper Catalog</strong>

<p>You can download it here. Check it out. <a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/static/lbccatalog.pdf"">http://littleblackcart.com/static/lbccatalog.pdf</a></p>

<strong>The Prisoner Literature Fund</strong>

<p>We want the project of putting anarchist literature into the world to be explicitly connected to the project of supporting -our- prisoners. Anarchist prisoners. As time is progressing there are more and more anarchist prisoners and we believe that it is imperative for anarchists to support each other. The LBC Prisoner Literature Fund is the first way we can do that. Help us help them.

<a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/category/donation/prisoners/"">http://littleblackcart.com/category/donation/prisoners/</a></p>

<strong>Abolishing the Borders from Below</strong>

<p>Did you know that there is an anarchist magazine that covers all of Eastern Europe, from Berlin to Moscow (and beyond)? It is called Abolishing the Borders from Below and we recommend you check it out. LBC is the North American distributor of ABB and we will help you get single issues, subscriptions or bulk copies of this important magazine.

<a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/category/publisher/abolishing-borders-below/"">http://littleblackcart.com/category/publisher/abolishing-borders-below/</a></p>

<strong>New publishers</strong>

<p>In addition to ABB we are now carrying publications from Kerbloom, Significant Failure, Mishap, and A Longing for Collapse Press. Kerbloom is a fantastic letterpress personal zine formerly from the East Bay (Oakland-Berkeley), Significant Failure produces the modern situationist pamphlet ""Gasping from out the Shallows"", Mishap was a long running, high quality, anarcho-punk zine (now moved to the Internet), and A Longing for Collapse is dedicated to spreading information about animal and earth liberation, thoughts on anti-industrial/anti-civilization, updates of political prisoners/prisoners of war, indigenous/native struggles around the world, and practical skills related to direct action, animal liberation, and wilderness living. </p>

<p>Check out each of our publishers at <a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/publishers/"">http://littleblackcart.com/publishers/</a></p>

<strong>LBC on the road</strong>

<p>We just returned from a successful trip to Canada and the Victoria Anarchist bookfair and will be visiting the Mid-Atlantic Radical Bookfair and the Reclaiming the Anarchist Tradition conference over the next few weeks. If your town is holding an event or is interested in having the Little Black Cart come to town <a href=""mailto:info@littleblackcart.com"">drop us a line</a>
</p>

<strong>We want to work with your local Infoshop</strong>

<p>We now have discount rates for Infoshops and radical bookshops. Drop us a line for more information.</p>

Until next time.

"event","I cnp my latest blog entry here but usually I blog at the Anarchy Magazine site (http://anarchymag.org/aragorn)

We've sent AJODA 64 to the printer with an above average number of printing problems occurring in the process. The process of producing the magazine was actually a bit smoother (logistically), prior to getting it to the printer, than the past few issues. Producing the content, on the other hand, was considerably more difficult. 

I have found that I am comfortable juggling many tasks only if they are in a similar problem domain; for instance technical tasks. The transition of switching from one domain to another is incredibly challenging. Switching from my daily practice (which usually involves responding to emails that are logistical or technical) to writing takes at least twice, if not four times, more time than it should (given what I actually end up outputting). Maybe it's incorrect to blame the domain switching, and it's just an issue of how difficult writing is for me, but the process is brutal. 

This upcoming issue is on the theme of anarchism and business. 

Doing a theme issue is a pain in the ass. On the one hand you can take the scattershot approach and just print whatever comes down the pipe that is even tangentially related to the theme or you wait for the right content to tell a story. Add to this the pressure of doing this on a timeline when (seemingly) fewer and fewer anarchists appear to want to write anything at all (and who can blame them) and I'm beginning to think that theme issues have to follow the content we have on hand rather than our desire for a statement. 

This issue should be interesting since the theme lives somewhere in the space between an interest in anarchists and their relationship to capitalism in theory and practice AND the question about where there is anything reclaimable about talking economics, economic theory, or the logistics of mass society at all. Again we are confronted with the question of how to live with the implications of these beautiful ideas, how to do it successfully (defined here as sustainably and without putting yourself in financial ruin), and how to make a dent in the bullets heading in our direction. 

Speaking of... 

The Little Black Cart project is slowly becoming a success along the lines I was hoping for. A lot of publishers are connected to one another in a way that, I think, honors them. Now to start actually getting their stuff out there! One of the big pieces to the LBC project that we just launched (and something I am really happy about) is the <a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/category/donation/prisoners/"">Prisoner Literature Fund</a> which is a way that people can donate money to support specific prisoners continuing their reading in anarchism. I look forward to this actually being a way that people can make sure some forgotten prisoners (like <a href=""http://supporteric.org/"">Eric McDavid</a>) can be remembered."

"event","Usually I will not repost my blogs from http://anarchymag.org/aragorn but sometimes I will.

If you haven't noticed I haven't been around much lately. When I started blogging a bit more regularly it was in the context of traveling and made a lot of sense in that context. I was doing interesting things that I wanted to share with my friends (and possible friends) and didn't want to have to tell the same story over and over again. The last two months have been filled with a lot of drudgery that I would hate to bore people with (as it usually bores me to tears) but there have been some exciting things too.

Let's start over. For about the last 4-5 years the months of January to March are filled with preparations for ""the big event"" of the year (for anarchists) which usually happens in March. Because of some decisions made by the organizers of this event this year was pretty different than other years (for me). I, and the projects I'm involved with, decided not to explicitly table inside the event (we still set up our ""Critical Carnival"" outside of it). Instead I vigorously prepared for <a href=""http://8daysofanarchy.org"">8 days of events for the middle of March</a> which took no small amount of effort. We also prepared an issue of Anarchy to be published in time for the 8 days period which brought its usual amount of grief. I finished the second part of my ""Anarchist Mythologies"" which I shared with quite a few friends. A few of us started <a href=""http://ardentpress.org"">a new anarchist publishing project</a> that I will talk about more when our first book is delivered from the printer (which could be any day).

<lj-cut text=""more below"">

Along with all this I also started one of the largest projects I have ever undertaken. It is a deceptively simple concept but beneath the simplicity lays chaos. Simply put I have begun the process of putting together an anarchist e-commerce site. This site will reflect what I consider to be the wide variety of the anarchist press and will take advantage of modern technologies and distribution methods. Hopefully it will grow into a useful addition for the anarchist press. <a href=""http://littleblackcart.com/"">It</a> will be launching during April and I will talk more about it then.

On the one hand each of these projects is really exciting and I could go on and on about how awesome it is to be able to spend my time working on them, I want to be circumspect. Tempering all of these exciting things are the real tensions of working with people who are ambivalent when I am excited, who focus on what I consider to be errata instead of what I consider to be important things, and the fact that I am in the middle of building infrastructure (for lack of better language) for people who are no longer there.

The bottom line is that the anarchists appear to have left the building.

Maybe it is just me but outside of the pettiness that is endemic to radical politics is a real sense that we are on a smaller and smaller stage. We are talking to fewer people. The tone of our discussions seems a bit more shrill due to the lengthening amount before we hear the echo. Even our conflicts seem to peter out due to lack of interest far earlier than they used to. We can't even summon the energy to disagree with each other any more.

Thinking about this eats at the borders of my projects. It isn't that I feel like what I am doing is doomed but that it just may not be relevant. This isn't because the content of what anarchists are talking about is any less relevant than it used to be but that something has happened. Call it the end of post-irony, the myspacification of social formations, or the irrelevance of radical politics in affecting anything like change in the past decade (or 6) but add my name to those looking for something inspiring. Something more inspiring than the latest pretty picture on the same old boring activism, the same old incoherence defended in the name of individual freedom (dude), or of the suffocation of politics by cliques."

"event","What are 8 days of anarchy? They are a series of events coordinated around the BASTARD conference of anarchist theory in the San Francisco Bay Area in March. This year the events include: several discussions, an anarchist martial arts seminar, strategy gaming, a movie, a conference, and an all day derive (on Friday).

On Saturday we are featuring the opportunity for people to spend time in a seminar with Jeff Monson. Anarchist Mixed Martial Arts fighter who has recently fought for the heavyweight title of the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). He will also be giving a presentation at the BASTARD conference on Sunday.

Check out the site at http://8daysofanarchy.org for more information and look forward to seeing many of you there."

"event","It is that time of the year again. The Berkeley Anarchist Students of Theory And Research and Development are holding their seventh annual conference. The conference will take place at the University of California, Berkeley campus on Sunday March 18th, 2007 from 10am to 6pm. This year there will not have a specific theme but there will be two keynote addresses that you are not going to want to miss! There will also be an anarchist trivia contest at the end of the day. This will be day six of 8 days of anarchy (http://8daysofanarchy.org)

Submit your Proposal!

We are now accepting proposals along any theoretical theme that anarchists might find interesting. The form is available at http://sfbay-anarchists.org/conference/ (bottom of the page) or you may email proposals to the conference email (conference@sfbay-anarchists.org), or send us your proposals and a little background info about yourself (and a SASE) to ASG c/o Long Haul 3124 Shattuck Ave. Berkeley CA 94705.

Finally

As always the goal of the BASTARD conference is to hear from the multiplicity of people who are working with anarchist theory. We recognize that there are many different ways to understand anarchism. Each of these approaches has valid points that are worth examining. Please share your approach at the conference."

"event","I am one of the collective that puts out Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. I am planning on coming out to the Midwest between late May (for the Our Lives Ahead conference) and (tentatively) early July (for the Mid-Atlantic Radical Bookfair). It is my plan to try to travel to Infoshops and anarchist communities throughout the region speaking and listening to what people are doing outside the West Coast.

I am hoping that you can organize an event for me during the month of June in your town. I have written about and given presentations on Post-left anarchy, Second wave anarchy, Nihilism and Anarchy, Indigenous Anarchism, Non European Anarchism (and APOC), the future of Green Anarchy, Bolo Bolo, Anarchy and Strategy, /Anarchy/ magazine, Anarchy & community, the Situationists, Nietzsche, and Elise Reclus (an anarchist geologist contemporary of ..... whose work is relevant to today's green anarchy tendency). My writings are in widely-available pamphlets, /Anarchy/, and /Green Anarchy/. My presentations have mostly been at the conference that I help organize in the Bay Area (the BASTARD conference http://sfbay-anarchists.org/conference) but also at other anarchist events and conferences. I will also bring a variety of media if the venue is more appropriate for showing movies (mostly documentaries) that could inspire discussion (or if it makes sense for me to stay several days in the same town).

I am originally from Michigan so I will plan on spending some time there during June but would like to hear from any of you that are interested as soon as possible so that I can finalize my itinerary. Motivation for this trip is to get the word out about the magazine, some interesting anarchist projects & to start or further dialogues with communities, to learn how our magazine can serve them better (given its pre-existing constraints). Ideally some (or many) of these events can cover the expense of driving around the Midwest but I will also bring our catalogue of magazines, pamphlets, and whatnot for display.

"event","As anyone who knows me personally knows, I am a very serious SF person. This is kind of self-evident given that I was born with the name that I was but at the age of 5 I started my own journey into SF. The first books I read (at age 5) were Isaac Asimov's 'Lucky Starr' series. I read a lot into my teen years and then I picked up the pace. I can say that for at least 5 years during my twenties I read approximately one book a day, almost entirely SF. This was assisted by the fact that I worked night shift at a hotel at the time but it would not be an exaggeration to say that I have read a lot of SF. 

I'd go further and say that I would not be an anarchist if it were not for SF. I am not a huge fan of a lot of 'political' SF (I have never really enjoyed UKL's Dispossessed for instance) but the idea of speculation on the scale of most SF still inspires my politics.

Anyway, I have always been a fan of SF in print but never a real fan of it in visual media. I enjoy some of the big SF movies (Aliens, Starship Troopers, etc) but they aren't particularly SF, or even speculative, to my eyes. I have absolutely hated the major SF TV shows (Star Trek being a particular offense IMO) with the possible exception of Babylon 5. With trepidation I started d/l and watching the new and improved Battle Star Galactaca series. I never really like the first show, although was a bit young, and really only remember the Henson puppet vividly so the bar was set pretty low, particularly because the SciFi channel has been a pretty consistant pile of shit (with the tentative exception of their redoing of the Dune series).

BattleStar Galactaca has far exceeded expectations and given another strong season or two will superceed B5 as the best SF series of all time (as far as I am concerned). I just finished watching the finale of 'season 3' (really season 2) and it was fucking great. The best thing about it... They were not shy about moving the narrative forward in time in service to the plot. Fucking great! Plus next season will be a combination of the best of V, B5 (with the internal conflicts w/i the Cyclon coming to fore) and BSG. Finally there are good times for the TV watching BSG fan (even if they just d/l it a week later...)."

I just put up a new poll on <a href=""http://anarchistnews.org/?q="">Anarchist News</a> and one of the early favorites is 'Against Hierarchy' (the Q: Best definition of Anarchy?). I have always wondered about this definition of Anarchism since it seems to be the one most plagued with nitpicking (Isn't your skill at X, like, a kind of hierarchy?) and most <a href=""http://sfbay-anarchists.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=345&Itemid=26"">ressentiment</a>. I'll post more about this later into the poll but it fascinates me that people would define themselves by a political perspective and then define that perspective in such a way as to be downright toothless. What exactly is hierarchy?"

"event","Many of the people who are subscribed to my blog find it because of anarchist shite so I'll give a few more thoughts about the '8 days of Anarchy' events some of us are organizing during the week of the bookfair...

Last year I was fucking exhausted after organizing 4 big events during the so-called Unleft Anarchy Week and said to myself 'Never again'. As a result we have organized twice as many events this year...

The big difference is that all of them (in particular the ones that I am the most concerned with) are really low key. Two reading groups, a movie, some board games, a couple days of meetings, a benefit show at Gilman and the conference. It actually sounds like a lot but it should be a lot less stressful than last year.

That said I am also trying to finish an enormous pile of writing & prepare for a workshop for the conference...

"event","For the past few years (including this one) I have had to privilege to set aside worldly concerns and treat the first 2 months of the year like an extended holiday. This isn't to say that I haven't worked or done the things that are necessary to live but that I have had the change to work a little less and spend the bulk of my free time preparing for one thing. The Anarchist Bookfair.

The San Francisco Anarchist Bookfair is celebrating its 11th year this year and really only serves as an excuse for anarchists from up and down the west coast to come to the City and visit. I'm not even particularly excited about the Bookfair itself. It completely reflects a set of values and a clique that I am not a part of. The speakers (on the occasion that I can catch one) are just about the same ones that speak every year (and represent the inclinations of the clique) with very few exceptions. And I (honestly) don't begrudge the clique their party.

But I also think it is important to recognize that not all of us party the same way.

This will be the second year that I organize a series of 'counter' events that should provide some entertainment. I am sure some/many of you will see some internet chatter on these events later in the week. I am also working on some writing to share with my friends during the fair. I am excited about all of this.

The nice thing, for me, is that this gets to be my holiday. I have long since stopped having any feelings about the bank or religious holidays that represent values different than my own. This week of friends, food, meetings, and play does represent those values. I am not sure I could handle doing this sort of stuff all the time (before the fall) but I sure would like to try."

"event","I had a friend say something to me the other day that I am still thinking about. When referring to the conflict that I am in right now he made some mention, or implied, that it was hard to take seriously because every couple of years I am in another major shit storm ""This time is is about your collective workplace, next time it is about..."" and even though it is true, and I have made the choice to 'problem solve' in the way that I do I am given reason for pause.

Here is an excerpt from a letter I am sending to friends on the issue.

<em>The reason that friends should not do business with each other is not because it doesn't work, but because when there are problems (and there are always problems) you don't prepare for them ahead of time because you trust that things will 'just work out'. It is a lot easier to 'wing it' when you are talking about the sums of money represented by a phone bill than by the amount that it takes years to save up.</em>"

"event","I am back from the East Coast and instead of engaging in the drama that is happening here (which is considerable and acute) I'll talk about my impressions.

Veganism
It is easier to be vegan along the NYC-Philly axis than it is to be vegan in the Bay Area. This seems hard to believe given the 'health' consciousness of the Bay Area but what it really means is that it is easier to be a certain kind of vegan (let's call it the wheatgerm and granola vegan) than the kind that I most resemble (which would be the facetiously titled meat-and-potato vegan). Given that I am from the Midwest and was raised on a diet of casseroles, chili, and hamburgers it should come as no surprise that I have never really been taken with California cuisine. Big plates are fine, but the fucking portions!

There used to be a place in Berkeley that, while I never really liked (probably because of the cult-y feel to the place), exemplified the m&p approach. It was called Micheal's and it closed 3 or 4 years ago. There is another place in the heart of Telegraph ave called Smart Alec's but it has gone from being entirely vegetarian to serving cow and chicken patties on the same conveyor belt as the soy patties which makes it pretty repulsive to most vegans. Their fries can be very good (they are air baked) but usually they aren't (limp would be the usual description). I stopped going there (as a rule that I have broken) after they added beef to their menu.

In the NYC-P axis I had (just to count the m&p vegan items): several types of soy cheese and analog-meat pizzas, fake cheese steak sandwiches, a Millennium quality (at about 2/3 the price) seitan smorgasboard that included 'steak' and several casserole-esque items, and at least 4 different kinds of BBQ chicken wings. This was in a 2 week stay and did not include the fucking incredible desserts (Philly has 2 or 3 active vegan bakeries!) including Peanut Butter Bomb, many types of cheesecakes, fucking vegan cannoli, angel food cake, etc, etc.

It also does not include the great Ethiopian food I had in Philly (in the top 3 I have ever had), great Chinese in NYC (although I expected nothing less), and vegan SOUL FOOD which rules the vegan meat and potatoes universe. There is nothing better than that.

I'll talk about the gloom in sunlight, crushing burden of the cost-of-living, and intense insularity later. I think right now I have to go find me a snack!!!"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I took a long walk from Chelsea down to battery park (the far southern tip of Manhattan). The big highlight of the trip was that I walked all the way around so-called Ground Zero. The striking thing about GZ isn't the high security fence, plaques, or the side devoted to being a 'commerce free zone' but the fact that really what it is is a huge fucking hole in the middle of a city that is so fucking developed that the micro small parking lots I walked by today had fucking individual lifts so that two cars could park in the spot of one.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see an enormous hole in the middle of that gave me pause and made me grin. Viscerally it is just satisfying to see this wound even though I realize that it didn't particularly harm Empire or that it isn't exactly a point for us working people against the powers-that-be or any such thing. Watching the somber faced suburban dads keep the kids in line to honor and respect isn't the kind of irony I get to see everyday and coupled with the stark nothing of the hole in the ground... Reminds me of <a href=""http://pistolsdrawn.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=31"">a rant</a> that I wrote about this constellation of feelings a couple of years ago.<br><lj-cut text=""Read more on an AJODA criticism""><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""http://leftthought.blogspot.com/"">This blog</a> posted some thoughts about the new AJODA that are worth examining. The fact that I am even doing this has already inspired one of the other collective members to scorn my so-called ""ecumenical nature"" but I think that there are some worthwhile points to address and some larger questions about how to communicate with other radicals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gist of the post was that the issue (#60 on Democracy) was flawed because it only addressed its criticisms towards Democracy under capitalism and not capitalism in general. It follows this with this quote

<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Seriously, because the whole notion that democracy can never work under capitalism and that therefore people shouldn't participate in democracy, elections, or in agitating for greater democracy, is probably the most misguided thing that could be done right now while the Bush administration is aiming at taking that very democracy away. It calls up memories of the RCP's Bob Avakian, who penned a book called ""Democracy, can't we do better?"" which made the similar case that because democracy in capitalism is bourgeois democracy that therefore Revolutionary Communists shouldn't work to extend democracy but should work for its overthrow, along with that of capitalism, in the hope that, like magic, true socialist democracy would materialize the second capitalism had been overthrown, without any need for building or organizing.</span><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which if I were to summarize just along the line of the biases that are most striking to me...
<br>1) That somehow democracy should not bear the weight of criticism but of questioning-through-participation
<br>2) Democracy has something to do with voting
<br>3) That the Bush administration is qualitatively more dangerous or anti-anarchist than another administration
<br>4) That by criticizing Democracy there is an (implicit) advocation of 'maximalist' strategy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will come back to this another time but I believe it clearly demonstrates the gulf in the anarchist milieu when you have a wing that actually argues for greater participation in the current system in the name of 'greater democracy' complaining that a magazine, by criticizing their actions, is in league with Bob Avakian. Here is the kernel of exactly the kind of infighting and sectarian politics that is the worst of radical politics. I agree with the people who take one look at this and run the other direction."

"event","My last post probably didn't thread together all that well. I guess my simple point is that taking a walk isn't something I make time for in my life 'normally' but find the time to when I am taking a vacation. When I have checked out of daily life. Taking a walk is a clear thing to be 'for' even when I'm not all that fond of where I am walking. Even when I want to boil things I don't like (nyc, urbanism, straight lines, crowds of unhappy people, etc) into things I am 'against' I can recognize their value to me, at the time and generally. 

After all of my driving lately I am having a bit of a hard time slowing down to a simple life. It doesn't help that so much unresolved drama is still dominating my thoughts but the next step for me is getting down to it, not creating my own future problems.

On New Years Day we took a hike in the NJ Palisades that was rather intense. We kept taking paths without any real sense of how long they were until we found ourselves at the foot of these rather forboding cliff walls and among the fallen remnants of their granite cavings. While is was wild to be 15 miles and a thousand years from NYC it was also some of the scariest, ankle shattering, hiking that I have done. At one point while I was feeling rather exhausted, yet plucky, I pulled out my phone and said ""At least we still have great reception"". Because we were right on the bank of the Hudson river the entire time we could see Yonkers while we were lost and the sun was setting.

I am reading the newest issue of the Match that I picked up while I was in Tucson. I still find Fred to be one of the best writers in American Anarchism, I just wish he weren't so fucking cranky. I don't even mind that I just about completely disagree with him I would take one Match over a hundred ASR's, IW's and NEA's just for the writing. The new issue actually has some sectarian writing by other people in it that I'll report more fully on another time. Fred has actually found people willing to travel abroad (in this case to the Bay Area book fair) and talk shit in his voice for his magazine. Charming!"

"event","I have set a new project for myself while I am in NYC, daily walks. I am not a big fan of NYC, the crowds, the hustle, the fucking dirty buildings that make the Bay Area seem affordable but walking around the city has started (and I am only on day two) to make the place seem a bit more tolerable. I am staying in Chelsea and so far have walked south and from the west side to east river (this Island is actually really small. You can walk across in just 30 minutes). I think I am going to walk through Times Square tomorrow and then start adventuring north after that.

Just to give this a bit of anarchist relevance, I am slowly moving away from framing my politics in terms of being against. This is not because I have such a clear vision of what exactly I am for (other than the obvious stuff) but because the 'anti' framing exemplifies so many problems with radical politics.

1) Aesthetics. I found big red circles with lines through them just about summed up my politics when I was a teenager. DRI just about summed up my sophistication with songs like ""I don't need society"" and ""Reagonomics"". The point was that I wasn't actually thinking about the lyrics (which I generally still would find sympathy for), I was feeling what was going on. It felt good to dance around like a fool. It was great to see DRI when I was 15. I was in a room full of people who were against the shithole little town that I was just beginning to understand constrained me and I was for that. As I passed through anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-meat eating, anti-leftist, anti-drugs, anti, anti, anti. I was less 'anti' than I was 'for' something that felt against this. This is far too big to actually stand up against, to put something in the ring with that stands a fucking chance. So I was for whatever stupid fucking cause gave it their all. It just felt good.

Many years later I recognize that it was this cloak, this presentation that was the way to understand many peoples politics. Anti politics are not the only rhetoric soaked politic based on presentation and not examination. Fundamentalist politics are the same, Leftist politics, the politics of mass, the politics of identity... Just about everything I have ever known, everything I have ever seen, is as much about aesthetics as it is about content. It just thinks that it isn't.

2) Slave morality. Every time I revisit Nietzsche I am reminded of a few things that I agree with that he puts very well. It is useful to talk about the origin, or more appropriately the geneology, of values, ideas, and systems. Foucault's only mistake here is his fucking popularity (and tenure). Back to Nietzsche though, this idea of master and slave morality is pretty rich. Simple definitions.
	Master morality. I am good. By inference everything that is not I is bad.
	Slave morality. The Master is bad therefore I am good.

Even if you don't see this in your own politics I find it really useful to see in the formations around me. Whether it is about capitalists or terrorists this kind of moralism is deep. <a href=""http://anti-politics.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=940"">Here</a> is some more discussion on this topic that I am participating in.

3) Public relations. This is a total sidebar and not generally what I am interested in but since I am talking to myself... Anti politics of the left, right, and rhetorical varieties is bad copy. While people may be titillated by the scandal and flavor of it, the idea that radical politics gains one whit from this orientation is niave at best.

The sad truth of crass, brutal, political reality is put well by Born Against (Nine Years Later)
<p>""I've got to wonder what the fuck its going to take 
can it be undone 
can we stem the tide of violence 
or are we gonna sit back relax and watch tv 
while the ""have nots"" get their heads kicked in 
keep counting the policies that failed and the lies 
that worked they worked we swallowed them down deep
swallowed them whole.""</p>

"event","When I was a little tyke my father (who I saw about once a month) told me that when I grew up that I was going to be a very good driver. He said there was something in my personality that told him that this was the case. I didn't see it at the time (other than in contrast to my fathers DUI habit) and as a teenager I had neither the inclination nor the resources to pursue driving when I was at my stupidest (which was probably a bullet dodged). 

If anything they stress me out. Because of my nearly constant poverty the only kind of cars I have ever driven have been teetering on drivability and my personality is of the 'stress out before the crisis so that you can be cool during it' which means that driving shit-cars has stressed me out.

This said I have just finished my third cross-country driving trip in the past 3 months (2 in the past month). I wouldn't so much say that I am exhausted from worrying about the car breaking down (it wasn't mine which means that it was in half-way decent shape) but I am just exhausted. I have been in crisis mode for the past 2 months. My business has gone to hell, my political projects are just not as excellent as I believe they should be, the ship is leaking and my bucket has holes.

But I am a hell of a driver. 2500 miles in about 56 hours as a solo driver aint too bad. Fucking sucks but I could imagine a fork in the road that involves me as a truck driver. Maybe that will solve all of my problems.

I guess I'd be a lot more freaked out about it all if my relationships were also fucked up but, other than having all my friends feel like they have to pick sides in my business conflict, I feel as though I am (for possibly the first time in my life) kind of on top of my personal shit. It is pretty nice feeling like I actually have a list of people who I enjoy spending time with and who understand and like me, warts and all.

This is starting to feel kind of pointless but I am going to use this for the next couple of weeks as a way to 'prime the pump' for some of the more serious writing projects I have going on. I'll update you all when they are more-or-less complete.

"event","I am sitting in a gross corporate deli in Amarillo TX right now. Nothing I can eat, creepy patrons, and desperate pimply faced teens. Nice. I am in the middle of yet another trip across the country (this is my third in 3 months and 2nd this month). Don't ask me about it. It is so fucking horrible as to escape the possibility of making sense of it.

I did a nice thing though that I am somewhat regretting now. I have been estranged from my fathers family since I was a teenager and for good reason. They aren't so horrible but as my desire has been (although for a long time without realizing it) to lead an interesting life they have been barriers. For the past 3 days I have stayed with them and done the Christmas thing. My secondary motivation was that it was on my way and wasn't inconvenient for me to spend a few days in AZ with them. My primary motivation was that my aunt (I have two) Karen passed away 2 months ago. She was the last dependent in the family (being a 40 odd year old Downs Syndrome person) and was hit by a truck walking to work. Shitty. My other aunt (on that side) was her primary care giver and had dedicated a sizeable portion of her life to caring for Karen. She is pretty down. Down enough that she made me uncomfortable one evening a couple bottles of wine in talking about not caring for anyone (in a mothering way) anymore and having lost the capacity. So... it was appropriate for me to spend the first holiday after Karen's passing with them and I did.

I just mentioned to a friend that instead of 3 middle aged people sitting around being sad it ended up being the 3 plus me sitting around being uncomfortable. You can actually see them go through the list of things that they would like to talk about but will not because of fear of me flying off the handle. They actually stated several times ""I hope this doesn't offend you"" as if there were anything that they were doing that didn't! If I have made it to this age in this society still fighting and surviving there is no way that dinner table conversation with comfortable people is going to really provoke a response that I don't want to give...

Speaking of comfort, a couple of things struck me on that topic. 1) My uncle at one point said ""The goal of life is to be comfortable"" which reminded me of exactly how wide the gulf between them and we are. It's not like I am purposely intersted in discomfort per se but I would safely say that I would consider comfort a defeat not a goal. Comfort is not interesting. 2) ""Aragorn! you don't seem to be angry anymore"" One of the few statements that actually DID make me angry during my visit, but got me thinking about what kind of life doesn't involve anger. Doesn't involve hatred, bile, and plotting.

I can't imagine it.

"event","and to benefit Rob Thaxton's release from a 7 year prison sentence

At the request of Rob 'Los Ricos' Thaxton, a prisoner who has spent nearly 7 years incarcerated as a result of a Reclaim the Streets protest against capitalist globalization in Eugene, OR, in June of 1999, we have answered the call for a new holiday in honor of the Haymarket Martyrs. The Martyrs (Albert Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, and Louis Lingg) were executed on November 11th 1887 for being associating with the radical labor movement. These Martyrs were anarchists, against the State and Capitalism. Their struggle was sparked by a general strike on May 1st in 1886 where protests where broken up by police batons and responded to by an unknown bomber. This date, and the execution of the Martyrs, is now known as International Workers' Day other than in the United States honoring the struggle for the 8 hour work day. In the United States there is still the need for a holiday to honor the struggles of the past and those who strive for social transformation today. This anarchist holiday, in honor of the Haymarket Martyrs, will be November 11th the day they were hung from the gallows by the governor of Illinois Richard Oglesby. His act, in the knowledge that he was executing people for their political beliefs, is held by anarchists to be the type of action that any politician is capable, and empowered, to make. The loss of the Martyrs is an understandably tragic affair that is to be celebrated in that it vindicates the spirit of resistance, and opposition, to statist authority and the spirit of life that these Martyrs represent.

This first year of celebration is particularly important because it will benefit Rob Thaxton who will be released from prison in the spring of this upcoming year and faces great uncertainty beyond his incarceration. We intend on a two part celebration of our holiday.

Friday November 11th we will be showing the movie Fight Club. While this movie has arguable political content, it is inarguably an engaging story of dissatisfaction and modern desperation. The movie will be shown at 8 pm. To determine the location of the event you will need to call 510.287.5917 on the 11th. We will be discussing the implications of the movie at its conclusion and will be accepting donations for Rob.

Sunday November 13th we will be preparing and sharing a meal at the Long Haul (http://thelonghaul.org/) at 7 pm. 3124 Shattuck Ave. Berkeley Ca. Phone (510) 540-0751. There may be music proceeding the meal.

Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed (http://anarchymag.org/) is celebrating 25 years of publishing the most challenging, creative, vibrant and critical strains of anti-authoritarian thought. Our newest issue examines the relationship both antagonistic and not between anarchist and democratic thought. Rob 'Los Ricos' Thaxton is a frequent contributor to Anarchy Magazine."

"event","I have been making sounds about taking some time off of my daily grind for a couple of months and in September I did it. I left the Bay Area for what is planned on being a 6 month hiatus. I'm still working on the projects back at home but am doing it in rural western Michigan (where I am from, originally).

Before I ended up here I went to the Reclaiming the Anarchist Tradition (RAT) conference (report back is forthcoming) and spent a couple days in NYC (great vegan food. Shitty everything else).

Michigan is really nice this time of year. I kind of wish that I didn't work such fucked up hours cuz I am missing most of the daylight but the fall in the Great Lakes region is spectacular. Crisp air. Beautiful foliage. It really is a sight to behold. Watching the leaves fall and feeling the temperature drop really gets me thinking about what winter is going to be like... What I am actually dreading the most is the fact that I will have to close my bedroom window when I sleep. I really enjoy breathing clean cold air when I sleep but since it is frequently -20 degrees here I am going to have to draw a line at some point.

This is not the point of my post though, although catching up is useful. The point of my post is to talk about how life affirming my evening was on Saturday. Grand Rapids (the town I grew up in and am just north of now) has changed. It is still one of the most reactionary, segregated towns I've every been in BUT there is actually an Infoshop in town that also serves as the place for DIY shows. It is called Sabos and is an IWW Infoshop. It's probably a bit generous to call it an infoshop as it really is an IWW propaganda set piece but even something that stale feels fresh and exciting in a place where the sidewalks still roll up on Sunday's and half the downtown is owned by the family that founded Amway (and the other half by Steelcase and American Seating).

Anyway the way that the Infoshop actually pays the rent is through punk shows. Makes sense and isn't all that uncommon of a phenomenon, but what made this particularly touching is to see the scene in action. Having lived on the west coast for most of the past 18 years it isn't particularly difficult to go to shows but it is difficult to -feel- anything at them. There is a certain level of watching people not only go through the motions at places like 924 Gilman but of watching people no longer exhibit any other characteristic than that of their particular genre. Not only are there no longer any Nazi skinheads (and the danger they brought the punk scene of my adolescence) but there feels like there isn't anything other than patterns and empty rituals.

This isn't to say that there still isn't a beauty to it but it just doesn't necessarily inspire me in any where near the same way that it did 20, 25 or even 10 years ago.

This show was very different. Of the bands that I saw the first one was an awkward but stalwart kid playing acoustic guitar with his own lyrics on the state of the GR scene and his own observations. It was painful to watch but so, so sweet that my teeth started chipping. Especially nice was the fact that 20-25 kids were watching and being supportive of him even though he wasn't very good.

Next was a local band whose name I missed and who played through the entire first 7"" from No Comment. As likely the only person in the room who had ever seen No Comment I felt as though they caught exactly the spirit of what they were trying to do. It fucking rocked. They fucking rocked and the crowd had a blast (it was something like 10 songs in 15 minutes).

Did I mention that it had a Halloween theme? About 1/2 the kids were actually dressed in some sort of costume which was touching. 

I am not sure what else to say about the event other than that it made me envious to be 16 for about the first time in 10 years, that I actually talked to a crusty kid who whined about being oppressed as a crusty because he is also a Christian (only in Western Michigan would that happen), and that I look forward to seeing what else happens at this space."

You wear dirty jeans, well-worn t-shirts, and your hair is a mess.  You're sinister and mysterious and look as if you don't give a shit.  You worship the Rolling Stones, MC5, and your older brother's band.  You're gonna make it big one of these days, you can just feel it.</div>

Sure... that makes perfect sense."

It is strange to continue to have my old bandmate (Jose) call me 'arrogant'. But I guess I've been called worse."

"event","Having spent some years now in the Bay Area my experience at parties is a little different than it used to be. At one time my experience at parties was actually extrememly hesitatant. Maybe this is because I experienced parties so clearly as a child as being one way tickets to self-destruction. Maybe because I see so many people who I may like otherwise acting like total idiots. Mabye what social skills I have just don't map to party reality. Anyway, went to a party at some friends house and actually had a pretty good time. Ran into some people whom I have some level of comfort with and ended up chatting them up for about an hour.

I am helping organize a dance party for next weekend. More information can be found <a href=""http://sfbay-anarchists.org/"">here</a>. Dead Radicals Dance. Damn straight they do."

"event","I've been emuling a bit tonight, looking to see what options there are from my punk/hardcore past. Given that I tend to use emule (and not soulseek), due to ease of use (I am not going to put together albums, it's hard enough just to clean out my hard drives), I only see snapshots of the past. It is easy to find the Descendents or even Mission of Burma due to their popularity/importance. It is much harder to find bands I actually had affinity towards like Still Life, or even some of the old New York Hardcore shit that I still have a soft spot for."

"event","Through what seemed like an unusually obscure and trying process my collective workplace Open Guild (http://openguild.net) finally was accepted as a member of NoBAWC. Now the question is, what does this mean? Will this be a way for me to actually coordinate with other 'coop-y' types on projects that actually interest me, will it just be another useless meeting for me to attend, or will I just let it slide as a pursuit all together?

Whatever, knew half the room so at least it is all cool. It's kind of nice to have events like this at the Long Haul anyway cuz it felt like home turf... which reminds me of the funny I made at the meeting.
R: We could have benefits here (at the LH).
A!: Which will be great because it will provide an opportunity to throw an event that no one will come to.

ha ha.

Obviously this was linked to the general statement that people shy away from the long haul because of it's 'counter-cultural' nature."

or could ever be standing in this place. 
part of me needs to know but the other part is telling me to run away
ask me to stay or to drive or maybe you should just play
and ill listen... ill always listen.

i hope you agree 5 hours equals love"

well ashes to ashes, I always fall down.

Wrapped up in my fantasy i'll be safe and sound."

youre just like a summer day,

Was my biggest mistake,

WANTED: HEART TRANSPLANT
competition never ran in my blood
to lose is to accept
she keeps me up all night
just trying to forget

thats just what he wants
but it hasnt happened yet
extened arms tremble in pain
and wait for it to happen again

one who can find comfort
in the trembling arms of a complete waste
is nothing but a far sighted soul
just looking to feel safe

goodbye, lay the blame on luck

If i keep hanging around
im gonna forget what it was i loved about you
the memories are already starting to fade
so for the sake of 
our perfect past
our perfect love
your perfect smile,
Im running away

i can't stay 
in this place 
i can't stand 
when the room turns round 
on my fate 
you give no guarantees 
there's no promise 
you can keep

Its time to stop pretending
this cycle is eating me alive
making me bitter
burning inside"

I shiver as I lie here naked on the floor,
Your lies that kept we warm for so long,
slid their dirtty selfs right under my door.
A quick escape was what they needed,
for they feared they would get caught,
they snuck out while my eyes were closed and our bodies in a knot.
Their plot to send the one they loved, 
into a frenzy of tears and regret,
worked with with such amazing ease,
that they will be impossible for her to forget.

New
4/1/2003

First fast forget the past,
The new has finally arrived.
Never the new will ever know,
What this girl had survived.

Bad before but new begins,
Just like the rising sun.
Time ticks through the trouble,
And love is finally won.

Leaky Dreams

I close my eyes I drift away,
Down a river of dreams that never does end.
The water splashes up against the sides of my boat,
Sometimes that water leaks in.
But not enough to actually make a difference,
It always eventually drains out.
I turn over on my back,
I stare at the sky.
The tiny lights seem so unattainable,
That I begin to cry.
My tears wash the crystals in the sky away,
Until nothing but pitch-black remains.
Now I am lost on this river of dreams,
My oars of time are wearing down.
And if I am not careful,
I will become stranded in a dream,
With no chance of returning,
To an enjoyable reality.

ugly girl 
in the world
everybody just point and laugh at her
she dont care
if you stare
cause you havent seen the better half of her
ugly girl 
a hidden pearl
no one should ever have to feel like her
cant you see
what she can be
if youd only give the chance to her...now

Your sin has finally set me free,
straying from the path of self destruction.
It was everything I didn't want it to be,
Now I'm surprised with my reaction.

No tears were shed,
Cause whats the point.
I no longer care enough about all this.
Whats done is done,
You cant take it back.
And everyday I hope you regret this.
Cause I'll never forget this.

Dont bother trying to get back in,
My mind will always overflow with doubt.
You stepped up to my plate and swung your bat,
And three strikes means your out.

You were nothing but my ball of clay,
That I molded so carefully, never pressing too hard.
I served the feast and poured the wine,
Never realizing you'd turn in to my fucked up Frankenstien.
What a waste of time..... 


An Avalanche Called LOVE
5/23/03

It was a quite eveing. No one had much to say but there was no akwardness floating thru the air. Everyone sat quite and content with eachother. NO problems and no drama. all was well on the western front. soon the sky became grey. the clouds that blinded the eyes of the pure now were dark and deceatful. they heard a knock on the door. no one had wanted to get up for they were too comfortable lying in their skin and exsiting in their life. She got up... she was always the one to get up... although things were perfect in every way they were just not good enough... compared to what i dont know but she knew... she had always knew or thought she had... she answered the door... a tall dark man stood there.... 

that night the sky fell... everyone was gone.. it was funny that something so beautiful and peaceful would end the lives of these people forever..."

If this is a lie,
then dont get to the punchline.
If I'm on the wrong road, 
dont show me the sign.
Cause I live for your love 
and I'd die for your soul
I never wanna see you go.

Lifes been on my side.
I spend everyday lost in your eyes

just for you to fall in and for me to forget what I'm told.
Cause memory is useless when you've got no one to tell, 
and my screams became silent long before you would yell.
But for reasons unknown I'll hang on a little longer,
while your heels crush my knuckles and I try to be stronger.
But strengh serves no purpose in a world that refuses to glow,
I close my eyes, take a deep breath, extend my fingers and finally let go.

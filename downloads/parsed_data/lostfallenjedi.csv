"event","So it's finally come to this.  I'm finally taking this big chance.
I've been so hesitant to try dating seriously ever since Renae and I split.  But I'm finally going to give this a honest try.  And I swear, I won't sabotage this one like I've been doing all year.  No more finding faults with her or pretending like I have glaring ones of my own.  I'm going to give this one a chance.
I think maybe what makes me so ready to try this is because I actually am going by the whole friends first system, which I do believe makes a difference.  It's early enough that if things don't go according to design, we still have a solid friendship and chemistry to build on.

Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday

[Bridge]

I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss and we make up on the way

[Bridge]

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

[Verse 3]

Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, 
maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby youuuu and I

[Chorus]

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow"

"event","The past few days have been so dramatic.  A few days back, I saw Renae while I was on Grand River with a friend.  Of course she had a cow and I got blasted with e-mail after e-mail, a couple of text messages and some facebook messages for good measure.
Really pissed me off/shook me up, because quite frankly -- at the end of the day, how long have we been broken up?  And I don't remember making some agreement that I can't have a life and go out and have fun.
But that's only the start.  I was with Lynn and Tuck later on that night when I started getting all the text messages (""hope you're happier with her than you are me; good luck"") and what not.  We agreed how immature it was and I suppose on the outside I took it all in stride; but on the inside I was absolutely seething.  Well I guess Lynn was too.  Yesterday, when I was at work, she sent Renae -- and I had NOTHING to do with this -- a totally 2 1/2 letter, basically just letting her know about herself and that it was about time she finally grew up (""you're not 18 anymore."" you're almost 22 for christ's sakes!).  She gave me a copy of what she sent and apologized for her intrusion; but after reading this letter, I didn't mind at all.  It moved me.  It's weird it was obvious that it was biased because it dealt with my well being and feelings, but at the same time, it seemed objective.  
I always get in my moods where I bitch and moan and complain that I don't have any friends.  It's times like this that remind me how full of shit I can be sometimes.

"event","Catchy title huh...I'm just catching up that's all.
With every passing day, my life seems like it's improving.  And that makes me happy and scares me both at the same time.  I've said time and time again that I like to know where I'm heading, and at this point, I have no idea.  Sometimes, I'm really spontaneous and at other times I've very tentative and hesistant.  I think too much, instead of being lead by my Spirit.  I know that part of the problem lies in the realm of me not wanting to let go of things that lay behind me and the other half is that I'm scared of what lies in front of me.  This is just something that I have to work on; please be patient with me.
Last night was awesome.  First time in a long time I just got to hang out and relax and be with someone who makes me feel comfortable on so many levels.  Seeing ""Meet the Fockers"" again wasn't all that bad.  I need more nights like this; here's hoping my wish comes true.
Later my best buddies came up to visit me -- quite a surprise.  I love my KLIQ.  It's been hard being away from them so much, but they are my real friends, and have been for sometime.  We got to planning a tentative party/barbeque for my birthday, but we'll see how that goes.
Tonight was interesting.  I said sometime ago that I felt like I owed it to me and others to be a much nicer person.  So I've made a conscious effort to do that.  It's still a work in progress.  One thing I've noticed though is that I get hit on a lot now -- maybe a direct result of my attitude adjustment -- and sometimes it's flattering; but more often than not I get annoyed.  Flirting can be fun, but there's a big part of me that considers it to be so superficial and one dimensional, so I almost get angry when people do it constantly.  I think I hurt a girl's feelings at work tonight, because -- I know she's only playing and not serious -- I kinda snapped at her when her flirting went a little too far.
But I guess that's just me -- being a persistent work in progress, I suppose those who want to deal with me will have to understand that I'm improving with each passing day, one step at a time."

And so much different from all the other Tuesdays and Thursdays of the past 5 weeks, the walk from the Bailey parking lot to class didn't affect me one bit.  I'm pulling through this.  And that makes me happy.  You know, I keep hearing everyone say that Renae didn't deserve me, and because I loved her so (despite the fact that she put me through so much) that God is going to bless me with someone even greater.  I'll have to admit, I find solace in such comments.  But I've tried not to think about such things so much.  I figure -- if it happens, it will happen.  And if not, who cares?  Que sera, sera, right?
In the long run, I know where my happiness lies, who cares whether I get it now or later.  I know it's coming.  You don't have feelings this strong over something that one day won't come to pass.

I can't be really in depth.  But i acknowledge that I'm a work in progress.  I just feel like something lies ahead of me that is really great.  And I can't be unwillingly to accept that responsibility.   Things change and people do.  And I have to be able to accept things in order to carry out my life's purpose.
I wish I had a clear cut idea though, exactly what that is.  You know -- ?  It just seems that it'd make life easier to live.  I kind of have an idea, but I guess I need to know too much to soon.  I just feel ... maybe if I'll become more open to change -- my life will began to work its way out the way it was supposed to be, and in some fashion, the way I want it as well.
I've been installing a lot of change.  There are things that I want to change.  
My body -- it's a work in progress.  And I'm not doing that for anyone but me.
And my name.  It's funny.  I've always been kinda running from myself -- from my destiny, because I didn't know what it was.  And the names I've taken on in these years have kind of symbolized my flight.   I was born Riccardo.  And he was I and I was he for 14 years.  Then came Ricco, and after that Ricky -- and I've alternated between the two ever since.  But now... on the cusp of hitting the real world and 50 months from turning 30...once again the name Riccardo has meaning to me.  I believe it is the name of the the true me.  I failed once; I won't fail again."

One thing I've learned through my pain these past few weeks is that I need a major attitude adjustment.  I wasn't always the nicest person.  I could be downright mean.  I'm not exactly sure why I was like that.  Maybe some deep rooted insecurity on some level.  But my temper and my anger ... it cost me something that I loved and cherished dearly.  What I have lost is something that I wish and I hope and I pray that I may once again have again.  I miss you Renae.   I love you Renae.

I'm sorry that they even had to end.  Never once did I think they would.  I thought we'd always be together.  This last month has been so miserable for me -- you not being here anymore.  You just don't understand how much I love you.  I try to tell myself that I'll be alright without you, but my heart and my head both let me know that it's a lie.
I want you to know how much I need you, but my mouth won't speak, because I know it won't change anything.  I've never loved anyone the way that I love you and I doubt that I will again.  You are at the heart of my very soul.
Just the other day, I was listening to ""Tell Me it's Real"" by K-Ci & JoJo.  And it made me think of us....in particular the very last lyrics of the song.

Three more classes and then I graduate!

"event","Man...28 days away.  All thing start anew for me.  I seriously cannot wait.  I feel like there's so much I'm going to do, and find out in 2005.  Honestly -- I feel like 2005 is the first chapter to the rest of my life.

I've decided that I'm having another GWP (The Great Women Purge) in 2005.  I just feel like it's necessary that I get rid of all that dead weight in my life.  Especially one person who's done nothing but drag me down for the past year and a half.  I have taken all my associated feelings and locked them deep inside; when the first of January hits, I will cast them off.

Damn!  I wish i Could just hit a button and be there already."

"event","This is has been a really up and down year.   It I had to define it one way or another, I'd have to say it was more down than up.  But that's okay, because I'm starting to see the end of this one and the emergence of a new one.  It's really exciting and weird....in the sense that you can cast away every bad thing and person that appeared in one year, all because a new year is emminent.  But that's exactly how I feel.  I felt the same way 2 years ago, as 2002 drew to a close.  And 2003 was better...but I feel now as though I didn't capitalize on all that 2003 had to offer, and I let the few mistakes that I did make that year carry over into 2004.  Well, 2005 can't be like that.  I have to do this the right way...and I'm sure as hell gonna try.
With 46 days left in this year, he's looking to a new one and hoping that I do things the right way."

"event","I don't know why she did it.  It wasn't even necessary, but she did it.  She said she did it because she wanted to stand up for herself, but along the way she stood up for me too.  She struck a mighty blow.  And for that I thank you.   You know who you are."

"event","I guess I just naturally expect the worst from everyone.  I'm probably the world's leading conspiracy theorist.  I say that because I called Renae last night after I knew our obligations were over.  Obligations -- you ask?  Well I, had to finish washing the game and well, I knew she was all over the latest episode of the Real World, so I waited til both were over to call.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 10:50 I think it was.   No answer, so I left a voicemail.  But I never got a return call.
So always needing a reason to explain such occurances, and because I trust no one, I've decided that it was because she was with someone else.  Yeah, THAT guy.  It doesn't matter what it was exactly that they were doing, because you can take it for what it's worth: whatever it was, it was important enough not to answer the phone and even more, not to even call back.  Now I suppose that I'll find out sooner than later that she was actually just sleeping, and this will all soon go away....

But my theories and suspicions are far more entertaining!"

"event","Man...does everything have to be a fight or a disagreement or a misunderstanding?
Females/girl/women always have to go digging for something that isn't there...
In fact, I don't know what's worse -- the fact they're like that, or that I'm just realizing that.  I dunno...both are pretty bad.   I mean -- but isn't it always like that?  Something's always wrong or ""you're"" always acting strange/different -- you can't win.  And you just can't say ""nothing"" -- whether it's true or it's the first answer that pops in your head, you just can't say it. I guess what I really wanna say is, if something seems like it's bother me, you should just trust your instincts, and leave me the HELL ALONE!!!  9 times outta 10, you will see a change."

"event","So I've decided -- again -- that this is it.  This ""love"" thing just isn't working out.
I guess that's why it's a forbidden emotion.  Because it consumes your thoughts and your feelings, allowing both to betray you.  Or it just could be because I make terrible choices in women.  It was a nice two year ride, but I think 2005 is going to mark the dawning of a new era for me.  
Everyone keeps telling me to keep myself grounded and things will work out.  Last night a friend told me that just keeping this current headache/girlfriend around is the very reason for all my misfortune, even suggesting that her presence is blockage and a deterrent for someone new to make their entrance.  I suppose she's right.
Who knew that Jedi mind tricks worked on a Jedi -- I thought they only had success on the weak-minded individual.  Perhaps that's my answer right there.  I've been fooled, manipulated, advantaged, lied to -- you name it and it's happened....all in 2004.
And all jokes -- and fanatical Jedi talk -- aside, it's something I must accept, and put off once and for all."

"event","so many thoughts but not enough words to express them.  that statement pretty much sums up the way i've been feeling for the last two years.  i feel like a helpless jedi -- not sure whether to use my gifts for good or evil.  a myriad of questions surround me, but i only THINK i know the answers.

LOVE

i love this woman so much, but everything i do to prove it, seems like a backwards step.
i was a lost and fallen jedi when she met me, but she saved me.   i didn't realize she was a savior in that sense, and i've squandered so many opportunities to redeem myself and be happy.  is it too late for her and the world to see.

HATE

a burning emotion that i keep caged in.  it fuels my temper and drives my quest for redemption in so many different areas of my life.  what happens if i lose control?

FRIENDSHIP

not too many.  and the ones that do exist aren't always around when needed.

ENEMIES

exist everywhere....


my head is a mess right now.  i'm trying to be mindful of my thoughts but right now it's too hard.  i'll be back later when i can be more....focused."

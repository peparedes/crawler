"event","<i>The following is not directed at anyone in particular, and was not inspired by any one post or event.</i>

What is up with people who don't capitalize or use correct punctuation or grammar because ""im too lazy"" or ""its not important"" or whatever? Fine, fine, you only don't do it when using online communication. I get that. I'll even grant that maybe you won't slip up when you're typing up a resume, a cover letter or (if you're lucky enough to get the job) an annual report or email to your boss or something like that. To me, that's a good enough reason on its own. I am a creature of habit, and if I misuse it in casual conversation, I'll be more likely to misuse it when it matters. Maybe it doesn't work that way for them. ""kewlies""

But here's the thing: It's online COMMUNICATION. I.e., by DEFINITION, you're trying to send a message to a reader. Non-capitalization, incorrect punctuation and bad grammar make it HARDER for the reader to receive your communication. I don't WANT to read something written in that way, unless I have a very good reason to. What you have to say probably doesn't qualify. I'd wager most people who read your writing are similar.

The bottom line: If what you have to say isn't worth enough of your time to write correctly, it isn't worth my time to read."

"event","My girlfriend bought me a 256 MB Lexar jumpdrive for Christmas, and while I haven't used it a ton, I still think it's pretty cool. After reading all the stuff on <a href=""http://www.hackaday.com"">Hackaday</a>, I got to thinking. . .

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Garf226/pez1.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

That's the actual guts of the jumpdrive. I scanned my room for something about that size. I thought of making a Zippo-drive, attaching it to my watch (it's about the size of the face of my watch...the USB plug would be sticking out to the side, and various other things. I then went in search of a Pez dispenser after reading about the <a href=""http://news.com.com/Pez+to+dispense+MP3s+instead+of+candy/2100-1041_3-5637456.html"">guy who invented and successfully pitched to PEZ an .mp3 player stuffed into a Pez dispenser</a>.

So anyway, I pulled out my easter pez dispenser and its two packs of Pez candy. Hmm, I thought.

I got to work. Using a pocket knife I heated in a candle, I managed to cut a CD case down into the sizes I needed. I then duct taped the pieces together, resulting in this:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Garf226/pez2.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

That part took the most work. Then I simply carefully unwrapped the Pez candy (it USED to be a removable sleeve with the flavor around the foil pack of candy...that would have been a LOT more handy, thank you very much...now it's all one piece), wrapped the USB drive and taped. The results:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Garf226/pez3.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v605/Garf226/pez4.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

It's actually smaller than the size of a pack of Pez candy: two inches long, plus the plug, and about 3/8 of an inch thick. I like it."

For example, I'm writing this post right in Semagic without any intervening windows or input areas. One of the coolest things about the software is that regular cursive handwriting works!

and that's exactly how I'm writing on my graphics tablet. Another pretty cool thing is that you can write entire phrases at once, just as if you were writing normally. I would estimate about a 75% success rate (and it even handled the percent sign and parenthases just fine!) (and the exclamation point!) at this point, and I only downloaded it about fifteen minutes ago. It is slower than typing, but it's interesting and might just be worth the $20.

I'd be willing to bet that a large portion of my CDs are unique to me. Anyone ever heard of Knowdaverbs? Christian rap artist. Yes, really. Luna Halo, anyone? Up With People? I've got local groups too. Also about 8 bajillion compilations, mostly Christian music.

Some actual interesting ones: ""The Wit & Wisdom of Andy Griffith"" (all comedy), ""The Other Guys"" which is an acapella group from the University of Illinois, ""Thank You"" by Straight No Chaser (the acapella group of Indiana University), and ""Main Street Electrical Parade"" from Walt Disney World, which is just the soundtrack to the parade.The song only physically takes up about half of the disc, so the other half is transparent. It's pretty cool.

<b>Name a book you own that no-one else on your friends list does:</b>
Jeeze, I have no idea. Most of my textbooks you probably don't have. I have <i>M.C. Escher, his life and complete works</i>...Henry Ernest Dudeney's <i>536 Puzzles & Curious Problems</i> published in 1967? Considering the political bent of most of the people on my friends list...<i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>?

<b>Name a movie you own on DVD/VHS/whatever that no-one else on your friends list does:</b>

"event","Firstly, I should say that I'm not entirely sure what made me realize this particular thing at that particular moment. I believe it was that I was looking up the history of eye-black use by athletes for a thread on the <a href=""http://www.straightdope.com"">SDMB</a> (that's that message board I'm always talking about, for those of you (that one of you?) on my friends list who are (is) unaware). That and the fact that I received a <a href=""http://www.levenger.com"">Levenger</a> catalogue in the mail the other day, and have been using my fountain pen more. Odd combination, I know, but stick with me here.

Ok, so the thing is, I don't appear to be specializing in anything. I'm not sure if it's a problem or not, but it's just strange to think about. I'm comfortable on a baseball/softball field. As I was looking up the eye-black, I reminisced about my days in little league and chuckled to myself over the thought of a couple friends of mine being in that situation. Would they even know what to do with the eye-black? Where the shortstop plays? The proper way to catch a fly ball? I'm talking fundamentals, people. Runner on first, no outs, pitcher up? Bunt the man over. Lay down a good one too, none of this jabbing at the ball crap. This isn't billiards.

I flit back to the Levenger catalogue, I don't know why. Deep earthy tones, leather armchairs that swallow you and your book, gleaming fountain pens with real ink flowing smoothly from the nib onto a textured page. Leatherbound. Academic. Lavish. Makes me think of fall for some reason.

Flit back to my job. I know basic principles of design. I know basic principles of journalism. Give me stories and photos and I can throw together a readable and perhaps attractive newspaper page, program for a play, poster, etc. Give me a camera and a subject and I can make a passably artistic photo. Give me a notepad and a pen and I can interview.

Flit back to college. Stately. Academic (again). Slow. Archaic. I sing, solo or in a choir. Acapella or not. Latin? Italian? German? Spanish? French? Olde English? Check. I play piano. I explore campus.

Flit back to sitting in front of the computer. I can slap together a crude HTML page. I know where to find things. I have access to information and I know how to use it. I've designed Flash animations for various things.

Thing of it is, I know how to exist in each of these worlds. I can get along in any or all of them just about as often as I need to. More worlds than this...these are just a sample. I can get by in any of those environments. So what's the problem?

I guess the problem is that I'm not entirely comfortable in any of them. Not entirely. I don't quite fit. Something's just a bit off. I go after one for a while, and the part that doesn't fit, the part that's irritating me, the part that is unfulfilling, the part of me that's not getting satisfied, whichever of those things, makes me move on to the next one. And after a while, I do it again. I'd like to find something I'm comfortable with. Some thing, activity, place, that's mine. Completely.

Another part of this, and one that I happen to think is pretty selfish but at the same time, normal, is that I'm not the best at anything. I don't mean the best of anyone anywhere, I just mean the best I know. As far as I'm aware, no one ascribes any particular ability or activity particularly to me. I've never heard of anyone in my real life (admittedly I'm limiting the sample considerably there...) thinking ""Hm...he really knows _______."" or ""Maybe I should call him to ask about/see about doing _______."" If I was the ""go-to"" guy for something, I think that would (sort of by definition, if you take my meaning) make me feel as if I had a niche.

Anyhow...just something I was thinking about."

The normal hot lunch and the ""special"" for the day costs $1.40. Other items sold separately. Snack bar items are fairly cheap, pizza is $1.00 a slice, I think. In short, a regular, filling lunch should cost no more than $3-4, depending on the particular food.

Policy: The school will not accept $10 bills (or anything greater) for payment. The individual cashiers say they do not receive enough change to make this a possibility.

"event","Woah. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air rap had an extra verse, featured only in the first three episodes. Since Nick at Nite is now showing them, starting with the beginning, I heard it for the first time ever tonight.

Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys said ""we're up in no good""
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""you're moving with your aunt and uncle in Bel-Air""

<b>I begged and pleaded with her the other day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kissin' and she gave me my ticket
I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
First class, yo this is bad,
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like,
Hmm this might be alright!</b>

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
License plate said ""Fresh"" and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought now forget it, yo home to Bel-Air
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby ""Yo, home smell you later""
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air"

Tonight, the guy had a 29-year-old divorcee, a mid-20s woman who was a surgical resident at a nearby hospital working 100 hours a week (and oh yeah, she had a three-year-old son living in Australia), a 23-year old attractive but quiet woman, and a 22 year old B*tchy shrewish waitress.

In the first round, they went white water rafting and he eliminated the Australian woman. Then the weirdness started.

The shrewish waitress was taken off in an ambulance for heat stroke while they were having their round-2 picnic. After that, 23-year old attractive woman and 29-year-old divorcee got into it about 29-year-old's age.

Then in the third round, the two people and the guy were at a bar. He said he felt gypped, and <b>left to find another woman</b>, asking everyone at the bar.

After he brought her back (a 24-year-old middle school teacher), they sort of ganged up on the 29-year-old, who said she was too mature for it all and left.

I thought he was going to end up with the 24-year old teacher, but no.

That was just odd."

Anyhow...

I just sat down to play a game of Madden 2003 on the PS2. I was the 1988 Chicago Bears.

After I ran the opening kickoff back for a touchdown and intercepted a pass on the opposing team's opening drive, running it back for a touchdown, I got to thinking...

83 points and four quarters later, I had held the computer to 0 points and my offense hadn't stepped on the field once. I scored 83 points with my defense and special teams. And that was with 5 minute quarters!

I ran back most of their punts and the opening kickoff for touchdowns, and I intercepted a lot of passes, running those back for touchdowns. With three seconds to go in the game, I picked up a fumble on their five-yard line and ran it in for a touchdown. Whenever I got the ball not in fieldgoal range (and didn't run it back for a touchdown), I punted.

I ended the game with 0 rushing yardage, 0 passing yardage, 0 interceptions thrown (pretty hard to throw an interception when your QB never takes a snap), and 83 points.

That was fun."

<hr>Let me introduce you to my room:
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/layout.gif"" width=400 height=400 alt=""Room layout."">

I've lived in the same room for about 15 years, and I've slept in the same bed for like 10 years. The walls have been painted once. White. The carpet came original with the house (it's the only room in the house with the original carpet).
<lj-cut text=""Circa 1970."">
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/carpet.jpg"">
Yep. That's my carpet. It's a good thing I have a Lava Lamp, balances out the carpet.

Referring to the diagram above, number A is my waterbed. I enjoy my waterbed, but it takes up an immense amount of space. I wish I had more space so I could have friends hang out in the room. Tradeoffs.

B is my dresser, C is my closet (it used to have sliding doors, but I took them off), D is my bookshelf, E is my crappy desk, F is my record player (sitting on two milk crates holding all my records), G is my computer desk which also holds my TV, VCR, and DVDs and videos, H is my keyboard.

The first thing you'll probably notice when you walk through the door is the art border around my wall. It's just this little tedious project we did in my first year of art (that I hated and subsequently dropped...). People seem to like it though. This is the top of the West wall, you can see the tops of my bookshelf and computer desk:
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/borderart.jpg"">

If you look left (at the north wall), you'll see a mural I did a few years ago on my wall. I asked my mom if I could paint a mural on my wall. She said to draw it out first. She didn't mean on my wall. I didn't know that. This is on my wall, in colored pencil. It's about 7' high and 4' wide, to give you some perspective...
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/mural.jpg"">
(I had to crank up the contrast in Photoshop so it would show up. It's pretty light on the wall.)

So you walk to the foot of my bed (the end not at the wall...) and check out the east wall, which has this hanging on the wall above my bed:
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/chalk.jpg"">
This thing is about three feet tall and five feet wide. It's chalk. No, I didn't make it myself, but I wish I did. It's currently unframed, because it costs a lot. I might sacrifice one of my checks eventually and get it done.

So, you're at the foot of my bed, the next thing you'll probably notice is the record player (F). I've bought most of my records at the annual sale the local public radio station puts on, where it's $1 per album.
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/turntable.jpg"">

As you round the bed and head toward the keyboard (H), you'll notice the bulletin board hanging over it. I used to have a desk over there. Well, a few years back, I ordered a catalogue from <a href=""http://www.crazyshirts.com"">Crazyshirts</a>. I noticed that one model appeared in each catalogue several times. One very <i>attractive</i> model. So I made a collage:
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/ladies.jpg"">
She's purtier up close.

Finally, as you turn back toward the door, you'll see the rest of the artwork from that same series, which I hung above my dresser (B).
<img src=""http://mypage.iu.edu/~baljones/artwall.jpg"">

Well, that's about it, I suppose. I hope you enjoyed your tour. Any questions?"

"event","Yeah, so yesterday wasn't really an entry. I'll make it up later. 
<hr>
I've been wanting to buy <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078902/"">Breaking Away</a> on DVD for quite some time, and finally, this morning, I did. I watched the beginning of it, then went to class, and just finished it up. The movie is set in Bloomington, Indiana, where I went to school for a year and a half. It follows a group of four boys dealing with life after highschool in a quintessentially college town. To cut the intro short, it's a great movie and I recommend it to anyone.

<i>Breaking Away</i> is so true-to-life, it's amazing. One of the things is examines, being true to life, is the disparity between the residents of Bloomington and the college students. <lj-cut>

Bloomington was settled in 1815, and just five years later, Indiana University was started. The earliest-known <a href=""http://terraserver.microsoft.com/image.aspx?t=1&s=11&x=1344&y=10827&z=16&w=2"">limestone quarry</a> in Indiana was opened 15 miles or so away from Bloomington in 1827. 

Bloomington was very much a boomtown. When the limestone was discovered and demand was high, fueled regionally by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and a similar-though-not-so-great fire in Boston a year later. Indiana limestone also won awards at the Philadelphia and New Orleans Centennial Expositions of 1876. Then it <i>really</i> took off.

The Indiana Statehouse and Chicago City Hall are just two of the many buildings that employ limestone quarried from southern Indiana. The number of quarries <b>doubled</b> between 1889 and 1895. George Vanderbilt built a complete mill to produce stone for his <a href=""http://www.biltmore.com/"">Biltmore Estate</a> in North Carolina. In the early 20th century, Indiana Limestone was used for more and more buildings, including skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building in NYC and the <a href=""http://chicago.freeservers.com/index/tribune/tribune.html"">Tribune Tower</a> in Chicago.

Then business fell off. The Great Depression, WWII, all these factors contributed to the slowdown. 21% of the current buildings on Indiana University's campus (most built from limestone) were built before 1940. Taking advantage of the of the available labor, many factories moved to Bloomington in the 1940s and 50s, including RCA. In the 1960s, the University experienced another boom, and a second (or sometimes third) generation of men went back into the quarries. During the 1960s, <a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~libarch/iuchron/iuchron.html#1950"">24 buildings</a> were erected on IU's Bloomington campus.

During the 1970s, production fell off again. Only five buildings were constructed on IU's campus, and the energy crisis and economy staved off construction in many other places. Many of the men whose fathers had worked the quarries in the 30s and 40s, and who themselves did the backbreaking job through the hard times of the 50s and the boom of the 60s, had established households and children before they were laid off when this recession hit.

<i>Breaking Away</i> features a group of 19-year-old friends whose fathers had worked the quarries before being laid off. Raymond Stollar (the main character's father) now makes his living as a used car salesman. The father of Mike (played by Dennis Quaid) is a police officer in town. I don't remember what the other two main characters' fathers do.

Anyhow, during a poignant and touching walk through campus with his son David (the main character), Raymond says:<blockquote>I cut the stone for this building. I was one fine stonecutter. Mike's dad, Cyril's, Moocher's. All of us. Thing of it was, I loved it. I was young and slim and strong, I was damn proud of my work. And the buildings went up. When they were finished, the damndest thing happened. It was like the buildings was too good for us. Nobody told us that. Just...felt uncomfotable, that's all. Even now I'd like to be able to stroll through campus, look at the limestone, but I just feel out of place.

You guys still go swimming in the quarries? 

<i>David</i>: Yeah.

So the only thing you got to show for my twenty years of work is the holes we left behind.

<i>David</i>: I don't mind.

I do.</blockquote>"

I remembered having some at a friend's house, a kind where you popped the corn, then put a slab of caramel on it, which then melted as you tossed the corn to coat it. So I drove to the 24-hour store.

Well, they don't sell that kind (that I saw) anymore, but PopSecret has a kind where the caramel is included in the bag, and you dump the whole thing out and mix it up after it's popped. So I bought it, came home, popped it, and ate it. It's pretty good.

"event","I have discovered a whole new level of job suckage.

<lj-cut text=""images and elaboration"">
So I've been painting stuff.

Now I'm getting down to painting the last stuff I have to paint. Unfortunately there are lots of them, and it's going to be frustrating as all getout.

Why, you ask? (or not.)

<img src=""http://paintedover.com/uploads/5/racks.jpg"">
This is a representation of some of the racks in the warehouse I'm painting. To give you a sense of scale, they're probably 20-25 feet tall, there's probably 4 feet or so between them, and the aisles vary in length from long to very long.

See the little yellow rails at the bottom? Yeah, I paint those. They're 4-5 inches tall and run around each rack. I (thankfully) only have to paint the ends, and about 10 feet into each aisle.

I put down two strips of wide masking tape, paint with a roller, move on, and come back to do a second coat a while later.

Now, all this wouldn't be so bad. But...

This is a working warehouse. By that, I mean that I work when they work. Unfortunately, in this case, that means that they need stuff off those racks. While I'm painting those rails.

They use lift trucks to get it. The lift trucks are designed to nudge up against the rails (so they don't bash up against the racks, so they line up correctly in the aisles, etc.)
<img src=""http://paintedover.com/uploads/5/detail.jpg"">
Again, the rails and racks. The yellow thing in the middle is (supposed to be) a lift truck. They have these little black wheels on the side that are designed to nudge the rails in case the operator can't get it to go right down the middle of the aisle.

And they scrape off the paint, if it's not COMPLETELY dry. And it takes at least an hour to completely dry. And we have eight or so lift trucks buzzing around all the time, so the chances of them needing to get down that particular aisle within an hour or so after I've painted it is quite good. I'm literally in the next aisle over when I see a truck go down the one I've just painted, bouncing up against one rail, then the other. I'm not faulting the truck drivers, they're just doing their job, and I'm sure it's nearly impossible to go down the aisle without touching either side (they have maybe an inch of clearance on either side if they're perfectly centered).

I've told my boss that it seems almost futile, that I barely make any progress until the very end of the evening (when the workload lightens), and that they tear up the rails quicker than I can paint them. He said, ""Well, there's not a lot we can do...""

It's like I'm sitting at a desk furiously writing a report, and as soon as I'm done with one sheet and onto the next, someone takes the full sheet and rips it into tiny pieces right in front of my face. Over and over again.

The next few weeks are going to be immensely frustrating."

    The job, not so good. It could be worse, but quite frankly so could a lot of things, and it might interest you to note that the phrase ""it could be worse"" has not once in the history of man made anyone feel better about their current situation. In fact, if popular media serve as any indicator, all that uttering the phrase aloud ensures that it will start raining on hapless protagonists in the second or third act.

"event","One of those movie ideas I just had:

I want to rig up my car (or a car) with a bunch of video cameras (top looking forward, top looking back, looking out the left and right windows, looking at me and each of the passengers, couple on the sides, etc.), load up the car with a few of my more entertaining acquaintences, and road trip. Route 66, possibly.

All the cameras would be rolling all the time, capturing all the conversation (some possibly scripted, but improv, I'm sure, as well). We'd have a few loose cameras for stopping at gas stations and restaurants and roadside attractions. Kickin' soundtrack, of course. Heck, that could be a minor ""plot"" point. I keep changing the radio to classical, and the other guys change it back. Or we talk about how we're going to pick the music, and decide that the driver gets first choice, and from that point, you can identify the driver by the background music. I don't know.

Then I edit. We'd have the 1.5-2 hour version for the theater, of course, but the DVD is where things get interesting. I envision several different choices for the movie: a half-hour version, an hour long version, two hours, and so on. I'd edit them all, and they could all probably be different. Probably have an option where you could watch the entire trip in realtime too. That might have to be a separate disc.

Everytime I've been on a longish trip (more than an hour) with one or two other people, we always come up with at least a half hour of some of the most funny things I've ever heard. That's not counting what would be scripted, or any roadside stops.

I think it's doable. Maybe it's been done."

Firstly, it was on video. Who wants to hear about EVERY SINGLE STUDENT at their highschool every time they want to browse through their yearbook? Secondly, assuming only a ten-second spot per student, if you've got 1200 students, that's over three hours. And that doesn't count any coverage of sports, extra curricular activities, or other things.

I could see something like this being done with DVD today, and I think it could be very cool, if done well.

Now, my school did do a senior video, which was cool, but it was just candid shots of seniors around school, sports, extra curricular stuff, various other things, all overlayed with the popular music of the day. Only lasted about a half hour, wasn't meant to be comprehensive, but ""highlights.""

"event","My local public radio (and television) station, WILL, held their annual ""Vintage Vinyl"" sale today.

Every year, they rent out a (large) room in a not-very-popular mall (there's an old one and a new one, and this one's the old one). They fill the place with THOUSANDS of old LPs, cassettes, laserdiscs, and some CDs as well, all sorted by genre, then artist. They also have hundreds of pieces of vintage audio equipment for sale, from belt-drive turntables to top of the line (for the 1970s) speakers.

Prices are INSANE. The equipment fetches decent prices, of course, since it's not terribly common, but LPs are a dollar. $1. Even Boxed Sets. There are a few higher priced ones, but those make up less than 1% of all the LPs they have, and probably more like .1%. For instance, this year, they had nearly complete collections of Frank Zappa material and Etta James material.

Firstly, when I got there ten minutes before the thing opened, the line was stretched all the way around the building. Everyone rushed in and gravitated toward their favorite genre. I went for Comedy.

I spent $20 on LPs. For that, I bought:

   <ul>
<li>FIVE Bill Cosby albums, including ""Bill Cosby is a Very Funny Fellow Right!"" which was is first album, produced by Allen Sherman. Also got ""Why is there Air?"" which was his third album. Last year, I picked up ""Revenge,"" ""Wonderfullness,"" and ""I started out as a child..."" which complete his five-album run on the Warner Brothers label. (the other three I bought this year are from later in his career). </li>

<li>FOUR Tom Lehrer albums, ""An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,"" ""That Was the Year That Was,"" ""More of Tom Lehrer"" (which is just a re-recording of ""An Evening Wasted"" done in the studio instead of live...), and ""Songs By Tom Lehrer."" Basically, I now have every song Tom Lehrer ever recorded, save a few. </li>

<li> A double-album of Woody Allen, ""The Nightclub Years: 1964-1968.
""In 1964 he recorded his first album live at Mr. Kelly's in Chicago. The following year he recorded a second album at The Shadows, a small cabaret in Washington, D.C. Finally, in              1968, he recorded his third album in concert at Eugene's in San Francisco. . . .United Artists, believing these albums to be important milestones in American comedy, purchased the three masters and after reducing them to two discs (with very few deletions), is re-issuing them so that the world wide following Woody Allen has built up . . .can have an opportunity to hear him as he was in his developing years..."" </li>

<li>""The Best of Spike Jones"", and ""The Best of Spike Jones Vol. 2,"" which include such hilarity as ""My Old Flame,"" ""Der Fuehrer's Face,"" the William Tell Overture (""aaaaaaand Beetlebaum....""), and ""Yes, we have no bananas."" </li>

<li> Two P.D.Q. Bach albums, ""P.D.Q. Bach On the Air,"" including ""New Horizons in Music Appreciation,"" which is a ""play-by-play"" of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and ""Portrait of P.D.Q. Bach, "" including his ""Consort of Choral Christmas Carols."" Hilarious. Professor Peter Schickele, the guy who ""discovered"" PDQ, has a show distributed on NPR, Schickele Mix. </li>

<li> Bob & Doug McKenzie's ""Great White North."" Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas (not the Wendy's guy...) are like hilarious, eh? Don't be a hoser, just go get yourself a copy of this album today, like if you can even find it, eh. This also included a single sheet to order Bob & Doug stuff from them (T-shirts or toques for $7!). </li>

<li> A SEALED copy of ""Shel Silverstein Songs and Stories,"" including ""Father of a Boy Named Sue,"" ""Someone Ate the Baby,"" and ""The Smoke-Off,"" (which definitely didn't make it into any of his children's poetry books...). I don't know whether to open it or not!!! I'd like to listen to it, and rip it to the computer (so as not to have to worry about scratching the record), but I COULD sell it, and it would probably fetch more wrapped than not. </li>

<li>Other than comedy, I love showtunes. I picked up two different copies of the Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat soundtrack. One touts itself as the ""first recording of the complete work,"" and was recorded in England in 1973. I actually had a copy of this before, but the sun ruined it. Hey, everyone does it once, right? The second recording is the Original Broadway Cast Recording, and was recorded in New York City in 1982. </li>

<li>Finally, I got a boxed set containing ELEVEN LPs (for $1, remember) of the ""120 greatest Broadway songs of all time."" This includes a guidebook, which contains commentary on each song. Can't find a year on it, but it includes ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" from the musical ""Little Johnny Jones"" (1904!) to songs from The Roar of the Greasepaint -- The Smell of the Crowd (1965). These aren't the original broadway casts, but rearrangements and orchestrations, but they'll help round out my (sparse) collection with some of the essentials. </li>
</ul> 
So, 30 LPs for $20. Correction: 30 GREAT LPs for $20. I love public radio."

Also please note that, as long as he or she has a brush or roller in his/her hand, there is no answer to the question ""Done yet?"" more satisfactory than forcefully placing the brush or roller into a random orfice of the asker's body."

Take your LJ username and replace each letter with the corresponding number (A=1, B=2, etc...). - mr_funny_man (what's an underscore? 0? Wildcard?) = 13+18+0+6+21+14+14+25+0+13+1+14.

Add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number. - 139 (if I did my math correctly)

Make a note of the first digit of this number, then add the digits of the number together. - First digit = 1. Digits added together = 13 

Find the post of this last number in your LJ. - <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mr_funny_man/2001/07/29/"">Post 13</a> 

Take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post. - ""Well""

Use the resulting word in a Google Image Search, and select a picture from the first page. - 
<lj-cut text=""Semi-NSFW (scantily clad woman, but all the good bits are covered..."">

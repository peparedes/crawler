"event","It's finals week.  I beasted my chem final and that makes me really really happy.  And I'm working 20 hours this week to pick up some extra cash so I can afford necessities like this really cute top I saw in the window of Forever 21 today.  And I had my first White Russian tonight.  And I got a free Red Bull.  And I saw two gay boys walking drunkenly down our street at about 10 and one said ""am I drunk?  YEAHH!  Its finals week!"" or something to that effect.  And its gorgeous out.  And I had about 6 girl scout cookies today.


How on earth is the most stressful week of my life THIS amazing, really?"

"event","What the FUCK Cincinnati?!  Seriously.  It's snowing and it's March.  I was okay with the rain and wind storms but this is too much for me.

I'm really happy this quarter is coming to an end.  I always love the last two or so weeks of classes because everyone hangs out more before their finals.  I am terribly stressed out about biology, but that's nothing new for me.  I just have to buckle down and do it to it.

And I'm changing my major, again.  Secondary education and chemistry here I come!

I had a dream about JM last night and that made me wake up in a good mood.  However, I woke up at about 7am after drinking far too much last night and had a headache so that put me in a bad mood."

"event","This snow is really getting to me.  I have had to call off work for two days in a row because I can't get Castro (my mazda) out of the driveway.  It just bothers me and I feel really bad.  But what can you do.

I had a dinner date with Kirstyn and Natalie this past Thursday.  It was our day after Valentine's day date.  We went to Cheeeeesecake factory and our server was Scott.  He had an Australian accent that would randomly disappear.  All that matters is that he was decently attractive and flirty enough to get good tips.

I was supposed to go on a dinner thing with my co worker daniel on Vday.  Due to the weather we cancelled.  He, however, had decided to send me text messages every day.  INCLUDING DURING GREY'S ANATOMY.  Big time party foul.  The messages have stopped since I responded with ""DO NOT DISTURB DURING GREY'S ANATOMY"" and we'll see how awkward things will be when we work together on monday... god willing I can get my car out of the driveway.

Trisha and I went to a Valentine's day party at some friends' house on Friday.  I'm going to put up pictures because I looked really pretty and that doesn't happen often.

The roomies and I at the beginning of the night.  Right before this was taken someone said ""OKAY now everyone smile and pretend we all get along!""

"event","Laaaaast weekend was amazing.  I always love seeing Natalie and her boys.  And I got to see Anna and Dave in a White Castle in Grove-tucky.  I miss those crazy douche bags.  I have to work for the first time in over a week and I am not looking forward to it.  I get to work with the 17 yr old that asked me to dinner on Valentine's Day.  I mean, it will probably be one of the most awkward situations if I end up going but he said he'd buy me cheesey fries from Longhorn.  How do I say no to something deep fried with cheese on top?  And then Thursday I'm getting Cheesecake Factory with Kirstyn.  And Friday is the Valentine's Day party and some other boys are having a thing at the Holy Grail.  Jam packed with fun!

I have been feeling very unmotivated this week.  We got 6+ inches of snow yesterday and all I wanted to do was listen to rap music and watch people do donuts in the lot across from my house.  I can't wait for this weekend.  I'm skipping all my classes Friday (nothing important, really) to drive down to columbus Thursday night to celebrate a friends birthday.  I'm beginning to lose my social life here in an effort to maintain my relationship with Natalie and form new ones with her fantastic neighbors.  I'm going to put in some photos now if I can figure it out.

"event","Well well well.

So, I woke up at 5:31 am today (without an alarm) after going to bed at 8 o'clock and missing Grey's Anatomy and the Office.  And I have been completely bored for the past three hours.  I've already done the online shopping thing and the shower thing and the facebook thing.  And then I looked at JM and Trisha's ljayyyys and decided to make one.

I tried to make it as obnoxiously cute as possible.

Anyyyyyways.  I am fairly excited about this weekend.  Today is FRIDAY.  I didn't have too much homework or studying to do this week, but I am nonetheless relieved for the weekend.  Today after classes I'll probably come home and clean up a little bit.  I'll probably end up doing the dishes as much as I hate doing them.  Sacrifices... lol.  Leah/Trisha and I talked about hitting up the hookah bar that they opened a few weeks ago on campus.  I'm pretty amped.  Its by the same people who have Gypsy in the bus.  If that falls through, I might just stay in and study because I have a midterm in BIOLAB and lord knows I need to study study study for that.  But Saturday I work 10-4 and then I'm driving up to Columbus to see my friend Rita Mikita (that is seriously her name) and Natalie and her neighbors for a night of dancing and drinking and general fun.  And then... work again on Sunday.

I know this is all fascinating to everyone.  Yeah!  What's more fascinating/embarrassing (?) is that I've been listening to shitty techno for the past few days.  I've infiltrated Trisha into the world of Cascada.  I'm sorry.

Well.  Time to get ready for the day.
I love you!

P.S.  Sorry for any spelling errors."

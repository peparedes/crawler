"event","Yay... another 6 day cover-up... i dont remember too much from some of the days... i've actually been spending most the week trying to not think about.. well.. today.. 

ok, so to the best of my memory, not too much happened on thursday.. and, since nothing stands out, musta been a normal average B-day. got up, prolly drove austin to school... again... sat threw class, went to work.. 

ok, the 14th.... waaas a Friday... uhm... and an A-day.. OHH ok, i went to work, then, after that, i didnt really feel like going to track and field, so i didnt, instead,&nbsp; i went to Cody's house and i stayed the night there. it was amazing.. played guitar hero till 4:30am, while talking to Kayla, our friend from camping, not his girlfriend, and her sister.. and i still managed to wake up at 6:30 and be at work on time!! =) got im good..

Saturday.. got up at 6:30... like i said, and drove down to Harrisburg, to Knife River, and started unpacking the 8 spools of wire, and the holders for them. then after we pulled the mouse threw, then the mule tape, then the 3/4 rope, we were ready to strap up the wire and pull that threw... god that was hell... pulling 8 strands of 2/0 wire sucks.. so then, after that, i got to take Steve to go drop off his truck, then drive him to the shop. next i went home to go pick out a christmas tree and hang some lights on it... its funny, we got a small one this year so we didnt have to put so many god damn decorations on it. after that, Rachel asked if i wanted to go to Catherines house with them, but first she told me i needed to ask her. so i did, and she told me i could just as long as i stayed on a seperate couch.. which i did... for the most part... =)it started out fine, just chillin, watching movies, kinda sucked tho, cuz i found myself wanted to go sit with rachel really really bad.. im still confused about her, i dont know if she actually likes me, or if she's just flirtatious like that... heh.. look at me, using big words.. i almost sound smart. anyways, i found out that, given the proper circumstance, she'd fuck me, which either means.. i am really fucking hott, or, she likes me... right? then i got dared to wear catherines underwear, oh, after they froze mine... so i did, and well... i found out i could never be a cross dresser.. that shit was too damn cramped... then i got to kiss Rachel.. for which i owe a thanks to Catherine *TY* and spent the next hour or so, cuddled up next to Rachel, trying not to fall asleep..i think i pissed off Catherine tho.. i didnt stay in my recliner... i've mastered, sit, beg, roll over, and smile... but i havent gotten stay down quite yet... At least im Potty Trained tho =).

Sunday... i didnt do too much, got home at 11:30 saturday night, and went straight for bed, then woke up at 11 on sunday.. went over to cody's house, after a half-assed attempt at cleaning my room, then i got a call from Catherine asking for a ride to work. so i picked her up, and dropped her off at Vally River, then went back to Cody's. We then went to McDonalds.. where we ordered 17.75 worth of food, but i left my money at home, so cody paid 15, and we spent the next 5 minute counting out 2.75 in nickles and penny's... were so fucking amazing.... then i went home, and went to bed

Monday, got up.&nbsp; then, of course, off to school, worked threw the first hour and a half. and since no one else was there to go to lunch with, i went over and chilled at cody's house. decided that yet again, i didnt wanna go to class, so we didnt, and instead chilled there till it was time for work, left his house at 1:30, got to work at around 2.&nbsp; got the mail. cleaned shop a little, then, at 4:30, went with dave to go help him pick up a T.V. from his mom's house, after that. drove home. hung out there. fucked around with my comp. went to bed.

Tuesday. i got up, and today just felt bad. i think i was dewling on it too much. today, 7 days before Christmas, mom and dad decide, well mostly mom, that they wanted to finalize their divorce.... yay... fun... so of course, i went to work. washed the trucks, did the stock, got the mail. ate cookies, kinda dragged ass.. went to school, did track and field, worked on our core some more, then sat threw government, after that. i took John and Mike to night school, then went to Cody's, mom dropped Austin off and the three of us went to go see I Am Legend. it wasnt too bad, kinda a shitty ending... just got home a while ago, didnt do too much, tho i didnt have the worst day ever, it was still burrowed in the back of my mind, and would pop out at random moments and completely ruin my mood... =("

Saturday was boring, Rachel said something about hanging out around 8, so i pretty much just laid around until then, got my hair cut, it was bugging me in the back. Rachel texted me later saying she couldnt go, she said she was hanging out with her family, and it was gunna take longer then she thought. so she said she wanted to do something Sunday instead. so i played guitar hero till i got tired, and went to bed.

Sunday came, Rachel said she couldnt hang out again, didnt really get a reason, i think she said it was her homework. so i laid in bed and watched T.V. with dad, then went out into the living room and watched T.V. out there, at about 5:30, we went to pick mom up from the train station, went back to dads, ate, then went home.i fell sleep at about 12.

Monday, woke up at 7, austin slept in... again, so i had do drive him to school, went to work, started out doing little odd things around the shop, then went out to the shed and picked up all the scrap metal and loaded it into the Chevy, then picked up all the cardboard and burnt it, that was fun. then headed into the G-rrom and started filing returns and putting them away, did that till 11, then drove down to the post office and got the mail, then went on my merry little way to school. ran track, sat threw government. came home, cooked pizza, ate cookie dough, and sat on the computer.its sad, its only 8:25 and im already tired.. i need something to do, i think i might go to cody's after work, or something, if its not too late.."

monday, oh joy... mondays can go choke on a knife... dad called me at about 8:30, woke me up. and told me to be at the shop at 10 to talk to debbie about working there. its right next to safeway in junction city.. so i showed up, talked to her, and my first job was to find a heater for the shop. so i hunted around for about 20 minutes, and couldnt find the damn thing, and just when i started thinking it didnt exists, she turns around and go's. ""oh, here it is""... -angry face- so we found that, then she had me run to safeway, and the post office. then at 11:30, left to go to school, and afterwards, talked to lourie about RTEC paying for my Residential wiring class. she said they dont deal with RTEC, Randy told me different. so did pete. i think lourie doesnt know what the hell she's talking about... dumb bitch... then, on top of that, i locked my keys in my car, so i had to wait for mom to come and unlock it for me.. then i went to cody's and we drove down to the harley davison dealer, and he picked out the harley he wanted. apparently he's getting a bike... look out world.. so.. thats pretty much the extent of my weekend/monday.. off to bed, night!"

Austin woke me up at 7 and asked for a ride to school, since i didn't have class until 9 45, i figured I'ld take him, and just get more sleep when i got home. so, i sat up, stretched, and realized just exactly how messed up u can feel after sleeping on a floor, i still hurt from Rachelle's apartment. so after i took Austin to school, i came back home, and called in sick. so i got to spend the day, sleeping. Austin ended up calling dad, and having him come and get him, and take him home, so him and i slept till about 3. then we got up, and i made him help me measure the house, so i could get started on my blueprints. we measured the house, and i got one of the three prints that i needed done. then at 5 30, i left for LCC.. yay =(&nbsp; 

Tuesday:
i woke up at 7, showered, and got ready for work, worked till 11. i spent most of the time thinking of gift ideas for Rachel, i have a few. but I've realized that , Catherine,&nbsp; your really the only one that reads these..&nbsp; after work i met Austin for lunch at taco bell, what a great idea that turned out to be.. lets stuff our face with Mexican food, then go run for an hour and a half. then i got to sit threw government, where we took notes about the judicial branch, and memorized, all three branches and their purposes.. after school, i came home and started on my project thats due tomorrow at LCC.. which really sucked because making it has turned out to be harder then i thought, which stresses me out, and, due to my laid back nature, i deal with stress in a self harming, almost panicky way... not too good... but its okay, i got tomorrow morning to finish it, its a late start, and after Willamette.. so i should be fine... hopefully... i just keep counting down the minutes till i get off work on Friday.. 4045 minutes.. almost there =D..."

Even Alex, who is gay him self, said Josh was gay.. anyways, i got to drive Chelle's jeep, and i drank 3 2liters of Dr. Pepper!. we had pizza and pop, and basically just sat and talked all night. i did get to prank some of her friends. that was really really fun! i convinced one that chelle was naked on her balcany, another that i was madly in love with her and met her on thanksgiving, talked to her sister for 2 hours, telling her chelle was at the porn shop, and all three of us talked to shelby til about 11. then we watched some witch movie, and eventually i fell to sleep at about 4am.

"event","Starting from birth would be WAY too much, plus not a lot of special things happened in middle school, but, since i made an account a loooooong time ago, and i haven't kept it up, im going to start from high school.

I started going to Willamette High (Will High) about 3 years ago, I'm a senior now, used to spend everyday doing the same thing, go to class, pretend to listen, then just wait until lunch, when i would walk around with Cody (best friend since 3rd grade) and we would eat bologna sandwiches he made that morning. We would walk all over the place. Down to his house, back behind the school, to the park back by the apartments, even trying to get into fights, though i knew it would never happen. So i pretty much passed threw the school year like that. Cody started dating my cousin Kayla, who lives in Washington, and are now working on thier 2y 6m aniversary... I think i hate her.. ill explain later. Cody dropped out of high school towards the end of freshmen year.

Over the summer nothing amazing happed, i started working at what used to be G.I.Joe's, I started out working in the wearhouse, doing for the footwear department, i would price and security tag the shoes, and an older lady named Marie would take them out on the floor and put them on the shelves, it wasn't hard work, but got boring fast. so i kept working, til finally, school came again!

Sophmore year came, and this time, with no Cody, to hang out with, i got to chill by myself, sometimes hanging out with Casey.I joined the chess team, and took 5th board. About 1/3 threw first semester, i met a bunch of people, including Nicolo, Micheal, Travis, Ethan, Jason, Mason, and a couple others. and we would play hacky sack at lunch and break. Some where during this year, Cody moved up to Washington to be with Kayla, he got a job at a pet store, Pet Puree or something like that, and worked his way to Reptile manager, he also earned his GED which was pretty awesome too!. Starting second semester, I had meals class, and thats where I met Tara Ross. She was my first girlfriend since middle School. about 5'4, brown curly hair, italian, she was pretty. most memeberable thing was my birthday, where my present was colonge and head. We&nbsp; lasted about 2 months total, she said i was pulling her away from God. Later that year, i met and dated Sarah Wood.. that didn't last long either. after that, there was destiny.. that lasted 2 days then I broke up with her.

So summer started, and Cody moved back down, and we went out and got us some lap tops, bummed wireless internet from his neighbors, and stayed up 3 days in a row!! pretty grand accomplishment.. 75 hours i believe was how long it was. i continued to work at G.I.Joe's, and waited to start my next year at Will high.

Third Year at Willamette. I started playing Chess some more, and started my CAM class, Industry and Enginering (I and E). we basically got to build a Race car that had to meet a list of Qualifications. By the time the races started I was the only one in our group with a drivers license so i was the driver. I was grouped up with Kenneth, John, and Jarred. John knew nothing, so we gave him all the shitty jobs, Jarred thinks he knows everything, so he tried to do it all, and we could only work on something after he fucked it up and we had to go back and fix it. Some time during second semester, i met Cori in English. We started talking, and i intoduced her to Cody, who started liking her, and would go hang out with her, once he stopped like her as much, i asked her to hang out, and we ended up fucking, thanks to Isiaha, who walked in afterwards, he had to ask if we were dating, and i dumbly replied yes, thus starting the longest 6 months ever.We started dating, i had many times, and reasons to end it, but like a dumb ass i thought i was in love, so i got&nbsp; kinda got serious about it, we fucked countless times, and did a lot. Cody started to hate her, still does today. She eventually left me, ironically, for a dumb ass named lucas, I see her every so often with him still. i used to go to lunch with Cori, then skip the next two periods with Cody, who had no school or work. during this year, Baily, Cody's dog, who i considered just as much mine, died. was the most depressing thing ever... 

Start of junior summer, i continued to work, and put all my free time to Cori (we were still dating at this time) she left me mid summer. start of the summer, we found out dad cheated on my mom with an old friend's ex girlfriend... thus entered Kim into our lives.. after mom decided she wasn't going to take dad back, he continued to see Kim. They now live together in Harrisburg. I've been working all summer. 

Finally a Senior... I have 4 classes, 2 each day. on A-days i have track and field, and Government. B-days i have I and E for the second year in a row. i work on my off time, mornings on A-days, afternoon on B-days. and i go to my dad's house every other weekend. 

Nov. 14 Wednesday
&nbsp;Got up, I think i was a B-day, I woke up, waited til school. worked threw I and E, then went over to Cody's.&nbsp; got a couple of texts from Catherine trying to get me to go and hang out with her and her friend Rachel, I wasn't gunna ditch Cody, so I told them i would stop by after LCC. LCC was boring, so i ditched out an hour early, and went to Rachel's house in Junction. we chilled there and watched Exercism of Emily Rose. I was lucky enough to be a pillow for both of them. Then 11 came around. I was supposed to be HOME at 11, but was reluctant to leave, with no help from them, so i ended up leaving at 11 and getting home at 11:25

Nov. 17. Saturday
&nbsp;Been staying with dad all weekend. both Catherine and Rachel were at work. so I had no one to hang out with till they finished. So Dad and i went out and got oil and a filter for my car, and we took it back to his work and i changed the oil and the filter while he fixed my cigarette lighter, then we went out and bought a car charger for me, and had lunch at Junk yard dogs, a hotdog/hamburger stand a friend of my dad owns. then at about 6 i got a text asking if i wanted to go to Catherine's house, i&nbsp; got there at about 7:30, Rachel got there a lil after that, and we set up to watch the Grudge 2, we started it downstairs, and i impressed them with my ability to pull out a hide-a-bed. but the couch was too close to the T.V. so we could only see half of it, so we moved up stairs to Catherine's room, and climbed into her bed. after a while Catherine decided to take out my wallet, then remove my pants.. this doesn't get sexual... she took hers off, the Rachel followed. a lil before the end of the movie Catherine made me take off my shirt.. after the movie ended we decided to jump into the hot tub, i chilled in there in my boxers while they were inside changing. we floated around till about 10:30, then we climbed out, and i marched around her kitchen dripping over everything. finally, when the chlorine was out of my eyes enough for me too see clearly, i drove home at 11, and got there at 11:20. laid in bed till 12:30 trying to get to sleep. my eyes were bright pink and both them and my nose was running constantly, and i had a head ache.. finally though, i fell asleep on Dad and Kim's couch downstairs."

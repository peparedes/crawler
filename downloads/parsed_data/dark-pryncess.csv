"event","One more day and then I'm on vacation.  After 230 tomorrow I'm offically off for one week.  YEA!!! I hate my job.  I really don't like the people I work with.  Correction, they are decent people outside of work but at work they are just complete morons. AH!

Being at work all day everyday with no interaction with anyone has really given me time to think.  I've come to a couple conclusions.  I'm kind of glad I'm single.  I don't know how to behave myself when I'm in a relationship.  Not that I cheat or anything.  I've only cheated on two of the people I've ever dated. Remy and Bryan.  But anyway.  I just don't know how to act.  I always isolate myself from my friends and spend every waking moment with whomever I'm dating.  I also have fits of anger and take it out on them.  I do that to my friends too.  I don't know how people put up with me.  But Duckie and Judi have said that I am getting better. 

I have to learn how to handle relationships.  It's just something I have to learn how to do so that I don't piss anyone off anymore.  Time to grow up I guess, all that jazz.  I just realized this this morning.  I was thinking about my other relationships and why they ended and it all came down to one thing.  My attitude.  I mean it wasn't entirely my fault but my attitude has played a big part in my relationships.  Christina was always bitching at me cause of my attitude.  Maybe it's time that I change that. I want to change.  I'm not doing it for other people though, I'm doing it for myself so I can be a better person.  I want to be a better person.  I think that if I really try I can do it.  Hope for the best."

This place is hell to me and I can never get no sleep 
there is a devil in my bed with me whose talk is cheap. 
You feel like heaven to me all I want to do is sleep 
you're like an angel lyin' next to me 
you look so sweet close your eyes and lets pretend 
remember why we're just friends 

my tangle hair will weave a web of lies within my sheets 
and in the morning I'll be nailed where you crucified me 
your blackened hair will leave a stain inside my mind so deep 
and when tomorrow comes I'll wish that you would worship me 
close your eyes and lets pretend. 
remember why we're just friends 

There may be a storm in London tonight because it's cold and raining hard 
my body aches, my lover waits, 
I pick the scabs from my arms there must be a storm in LA tonight 
because it's cold and raining hard I miss your kiss. 
I miss your face, I miss the stars of your arms the man that I lust in 
he I do trust for he is my God my anti Jesus he is my saviour my salvation 
he leeds me into temptation in my highest hour
my lowest moment he is my torture 
he is my torment and I will pray for him to remain my friend and save me from my enemies... 
forever amen
this place is hell to me and I can never get no sleep 
there is a devil in the bed with me whose talk is...

Let Her Cry


She sits alone by a lamppost 
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind 
She says dad's the one I love the most 
But Stipe's not far behind 

She never let's me in 
Only tells me where she's been 
When she's had too much to drink 
I say that I don't care 
I just run my hands through her dark hair 
Then I pray to God you gotta help me fly away 
And just... 

chorus: 

Let her cry 
If the tears fall down like rain 
Let her sing 
If it eases all her pain 
Let her go 
Let her walk right out on me 
And if the sun comes up tomorrow 
Let her be, let her be 

This morning I woke up alone 
Found a note standing by the phone 
Saying, ""Baby, maybe I'll be back someday"" 
I wanted to look for you 
You walked in I didn't know just what I should do 
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself 
Saying... 

(chorus) 
(chorus) 

Last night I tried to leave 
Cried so much I could not believe 
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago 
She went in the back to get high 
And I sat down on my couch and cried 
Yelling ""Oh mama, please help me 
Won't you hold my hand"" 
And...

I thought maybe he had changed. Well he did change but he still has his some of his old habits that I just can't stand. Like telling me he's gonna call me and doesn't then ends up giving me an excuse that's really fucking lame. I don't think this is gonna work out anymore. I talked to him last night and he said he was gonna take care of the little obstacle in our way but I don't even know if he did that. I've heard these things one too many times. I was forced fed the ""baby this time will be differnt"" senario too many times to believe it anymore. My faith in men isn't there anymore. I know all the lines and I hate them.

I'm glad we're friends, I really am.  Maybe it's just better that way. I'm just not the kinda girl that you date I guess. oh well, not my problem.

Bif Naked
I stand here in the pouring rain 
You couldnt even be there to pick me up. 
Yer taking me for granted, again 
Yer running outa time, and yer out of luck! 

Just a moment of weakness. 
I should examine my head! 
Just a moment of weakness. 
I never meant a word I said! 

I'm sick with the Bejing Flu 
and you choose not to come home 
A week later i caught you 
kissing a girl who was my clone! 

Just a moment of weakness. 
I should examine my head! 
Just a moment of weakness. 
I never meant a word i said! 

(oh, why should i stay and pretend? 
you make me laugh again 
My darling, truth-is we are not even friends! 
oh, love comes and it goes. 
where you heart stops no one knows... 
how did i wind up in this mess, here with you!) 

Just a moment of weakness. 
I should examine my head! 
Just a moment of weakness. 
I never meant a word i said! 


**okay I'm in love with this song. It just sums up how I feel right now, like my whole life is just nothing but a moment of weakness.**

**okay i've been lying I don't hate this song, it just reminds me of someone. I use to listen to this all the time around her but little did I know that it was her and her EX GIRLFRIEND'S SONG. It's pretty anyway. Oh well it doesn't matter anymore. I like the damn song. Are you happy now Krys?? love you.**

Bif Naked
It was a Monday, when my lover told me, 
""Never pay the Reaper with love only."" 
What could i say to you except "" I love you"" 
and ""I'd give my life for yours."" 

I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES, DEAR. 

The first time we made love, I..I wasn't sober. 
(and you told me you loved me over, and over) 
How can I ever love another, when i miss you every day... 
Remember the time we made love in the roses? 
(and you took my pictures in all sorts of poses!) 
How can I ever get over you, when I'd give my life for yours 

I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES, DEAR. 

My dear, 
Its time to say I thank God for you. 
I thank God for you in each and every single way. 
And i know...i know... i know... i know...its time 
to let you know. Time to let you know. Time to 
let you know. Time to sit here and say: 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES. 
I KNOW WE ARE..WE ARE THE LUCKY ONES, DEAR

Possession


Listen as the wind blows 
from across the great divide 
Voices trapped in yearning 
memories trapped in time 
The night is my companion 
and solitude my guide 
Would I spend forever here 
and not be satisfied 

And I would be the one 
to hold you down 
kiss you so hard 
I'll take your breath away 
and after I'd wipe away the tears 
Just close your eyes dear 

Through this world I've stumbled 
so many times betrayed, 
Trying to find an honest word, 
to find the truth enslaved, 
Oh you speak to me in riddles and 
you speak to me in rhymes 
My body aches to breathe your breath, 
you words keep me alive, 

And I would be the one 
to hold you down, 
kiss you so hard, 
I'll take your breath away 
and after I'd wipe away the tears, 
Just close your eyes dear 

Into this night I wander, 
it's morning that I dread, 
Another day of knowing of 
the path I fear to tread, 
Oh into the sea of waking dreams 
I follow without pride, 
Nothing stands between us here 
and I won't be denied, 

And I would be the one 
to hold you down, 
kiss you so hard, 
I'll take your breath away 
and after I'd wipe away the tears, 
Just close your eyes dear..."

Hoping to catch a glimpse of me.
Have you ever smelled my perfume,
And thought I was near by.
Have you ever looked at my picture,
Just so you could see my face.
Have you ever picked up the phone,
Only to dial my number and hang up.
Have you ever dreamt of me,
Only to wake up and realize you can't have me anymore.
Have you ever longed to have me in your arms,
Only to realize that you can't.
Have you ever looked at your new girlfriend,
And almost called her by my name.
Have you ever wished to just hear my voice one time,
Just to remember that you keep pushing me away and can't.
Have you ever woken up in the morning,
Only to see that I'm not next to you.
Have you ever regretted giving me up,
And remembered it was our stubbornness that drove us apart.
Have you ever wished that it was me you were with,
Instead of this other girl.
Have you ever wanted to get back together,
But were too afraid to admit you were wrong.

You still linger in my mind,
Refusing to go away.
I tell myself you never loved me,
As if that would make it easier.
I tell myself I'm better off without you,
But I still want you by my side.
I love you,
Even though I don't want to.
I long to hold you,
To kiss you and hold you close.
I miss feeling safe in your arms,
I miss laughing together.
Do you even think of those times,
Or does your mind linger on the bad times.
Do you let yourself think of me,
Or did you really erase me.
If I could tell you one thing it would be this,
I will always love you.



<3 I miss you sunshine, and I do love you, despite everything. I just wish you would talk to me. Can't you put aside your anger and your stubbornness? I would if you would. I know you have someone else, I don't care about that and I'm not trying to mess that up. I just want us to be able to speak like people again. You are the one person who I get so angry with but still love unconditionally. Why? But I'm gonna stop this now. If you are infact reading this you'll just dismiss it and say i'm crazy. You'll say I'm obsessed with you and tweaking out.  I'm not crazy, I'm just hurt.  I would have been fine if I hadn't had the hope of us getting back together in August. I guess I know now how Rachel felt when we got together. Liz will know what it's like too probably. It sucks, but I'm surviving. I can't be with you anymore, I know this. But it doesn't mean that it still doesn't hurt. I just want you to know that if you ever need me for anything, I'm here. I know you have friends you can go to but if you ever feel the need to just talk to me, call me. <3"

She crawls on webs of lies
I die up inside her

too old to fix
too dead to ever acquire
slit wrists - talk shit
But she will never inspire
a plan to save herself

"event","Yeah I'm in a mood right now. Oh boy do I feel like taking my anger out on someone. Well not someone, someone in particular. I feel like going off on her and just fucking making her feel all the pain that I have trapped in my heart. I feel like a bomb ready to explode. I've been on the brink of it since August. Now my fuse is slowly burning towards the bottom. I just wanna go off somewhere tonight and break shit. I need to be destructive. If I don't do something I'm gonna turn on myself and I'll start the whole vicious cycle. fuck me. 

To top it all off, I'm having all these weird feelings towards a friend of mine and it's just not cool to have these feelings. They know too much about me. But damnit they won't go away. I can't stop them. I just finally admitted what people were telling me all along and I want it to disappear. I want it to go away!! But I like impossible situations, cause I like to have something to complain about. Someone said that to me I forget who it was, but they are fucking wrong. But whatever.

Back to this exploding thing. What set me off, you don't even want to know. Let's just say she's about 5 foot 8 or 9 with brown hair and big brown eyes. Need a bigger hint, SHE USE TO LOVE ME. I have been thinking about her alot the past few weeks, well the past month and half. It's like she's stuck in my damn head. I wanna take a power drill, put it to my temple and drill her out of my head. Then maybe I'll get some peace and quiet up there so I can think. Every time things get quiet all I hear in my head is her telling me how much she loves me and how we're gonna be happy together. I hear her promising that she'll never leave me. NEVER LEAVE ME HUH???? Seems like ya did. I mean I tried and tried and tried. Then i gave up. Then my damn birthday came along.

Why did she have to send me those flowers. Why? Cause she knew it would make me weaken, cause I'm weak. Well not anymore. NO more crying, No more tears, No more pining away, NO MORE YOU. Never leave me huh? Ha! Yeah right. You dropped me for that girl faster then I could say Hey. Story of my life. There's always someone better than me, prettier than me, YOUNGER than me, thinner than me, and the list goes on and on. 

How easily I was replaced. That goes to show you how important our relationship was. I bet every single thing she told me she's telling her new little princess right now. AHH fuck it they deserve each other. I'd rather DIE then deal with posers and people who spout off the same generic lines to ALL of their g/fs.

As you use to say to me all the time ""No one likes a whiner"" So I'm done.

""fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you. I'm out."""

Fuck making appointments and shit, I shouldn't have to do that. They got pissed at me last year when I kept blowing them off and all they do is blow me off. Yeah okay dude, that makes perfect sense. I've apologized numerous times for blowing people off when I was with Christina. What about you???? You've been doing more than blowing me off. You blow everyone off but your signicant other. And you're changing into something that isn't you. You don't make your own decisions anymore, or even act as social as you use to be. Eveytime we hang out you hardly talk, that is if we actually have time to hang out just the two of us. It hasn't been just the two of us for awhile. Fuck this I'll see if we can do it next week shit. I'm going through a lot of shit lately and need my best friend. But whatever dude it's alright. Go on discluding all of your friends from  your life. If shit comes crashing down and you have no one to go to or a shoulder to cry on remember it was you who pushed us all away. We don't know who you are anymore.

Call me bitchy or whatever but I'm sorry I've been holding this in for too damn long. It had to be said. So I'm sorry if I'm being harsh but sometimes life is harsh."

Turn her over
A candle is lit, I see through her
Blow it out and save all her ashes for me

Curse me sold her
The poison that runs it's course through her
Pale white skin with strawberry gashes all over all over

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
with strawberry gashes all over

Called her over
and asked her if she was improving
She said ""feels fine"" it's wonderful wonderful here

Hex me told her
I dreamt of a devil that knew her
Pale white skin with strawberry gashes all over all over

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
with strawberry gashes all over

I lay quiet
waiting for her voice to say
""Some things you lose and some things you just give away""

Scold me failed her
If only I'd held on tighter to her
Pale white skin that twisted and withered away from me away from me

Watch me lose her
It's almost like losing myself
Give her my soul
and let them take somebody else get away from me

Watch me fault her
You're living like a disaster
She said kill me faster
with strawberry gashes all over all over me"

I hung out with Seretha, I haven't seen her in like a year, and we caught up but afterwards it was like wow what do i talk about. It's like that with Kris, Phyl and Andy too. I talk to them and I start to feel weird after 10 mins. It hurts that I'm having these feelings cause I love all them so much. I've never had a problem talking to these people and it just seems like the don't care or anything anymore. Well not Seretha, things are just weird with her cause i haven't seen her in a while. But Andy, Kris and Phyl, I don't know. I feel so weird around them. Ah I think i'm cracking up.
Why do i feel so disenchanted? 
Why can't I just feel normal again?"

"event","I think I'm seriously a dork. I was eating dove chocolate promises last night. Incase you don't know they have little words of wisdom on the wrapper. Well one of the ones I got said ""Call an old friend"". So I did. Well I didn't call her I i/med her. No it wasnt Christina. I'm not THAT insane. Besides I don't know her new s/n. It's better that way. But I decided that it was time to talk to this old friend because I do miss them. I miss hanging out with them and talking to them. Hopefully we can get together soon and catch up but who knows really? Certainly not I. But I really really want to see them. It would be soooo nice. 
Oh well gonna go. Later......."

There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home
Oh, seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
and maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
But right now..

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains..

You're gone..
You're gone..
Baby you're gone
Girl you're gone, baby girl, you're gone..
You're gone..
You're...

I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
Time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
and maybe I could change my every day 
But baby I don't want to 

So I'll just hang around
and find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
and I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do

Yeeaah....

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I Drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains

You're gone..
You're gone..
You're gone
You're gone...you're gone.. you're....
Gone

Ohhh...

Oh what'll I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby where will I be
We are apart
Am I still in your heart? 
Baby why don't you see?
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I've drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
But the truth remains

Been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind

You're gone..
You're gone..
You're gone
You're gone
Gone
You're gone..

But the truth remains
You're...."

That happened on Tuesday. I went to the eye doctor and they wanted 200 dollars for glasses. I was like NO FUCKING WAY, KISS MY ASS!! Well i didn't say that. I told my mom that. I was like fuck it i'll just put in my contact anyway. Today my eye is okay. Yea!! I put my contacts in and my eye is perfect. Yea!! And today I made 47 dollars in tips in 9 hours. Yea for me.

Cruel Summer


Hot summer streets 
And the pavements are burning 
I sit around 
Trying to smile but 
The air is so heavy and dry 
Strange voices are saying 
(What did they say) 
Things I can't understand 
It's too close for comfort 
This heat has got 
Right out of hand 

It's a cruel, (cruel,) cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel,) cruel summer 
Now you're gone 



The city is crowded 
My friends are away 
And I'm on my own 
It's too hot to handle 
So I got to get up and go 

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel,) cruel summer 
Now you're gone 

Gonna feel only it was 

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer 
(Leaving me) leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel,) cruel summer 
Now you're gone 



It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, cruel summer 
Now you're gone 

Gonna feel only it was 

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer 
(Leaving me) leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel,) cruel summer 
Now you're gone

It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer 
(Leaving me) leaving me here on my own 
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel,) cruel summer 
Now...

Family reunion in WVa is today. Mom, Dad, and ChaCha are there. Wish I was. I love WVa. It's so pretty there. The mountains and hollers. It's all beautiful. I had wanted to take Christina to show her the house where my grandfather grew up, but things change. She would have loved WVa too. It's country enough for her LoL. Anyway.

Been doing my usual amount of thinking and shit. My brain needs an off switch but I'm not as lucky as some people. I can't stop the thoughts coming into my head. I woke up this morning in a real bad attitude. Cranky and shit. But it wasn't a bad day all in all. Can't wait to go to the bar. Then my brain will have the off switch. Cause I'll be drinking. I just have to stay away from phones. Keep me away from phones. Amanda plus alcohol equals me calling someone who said they never wanted to hear from me again. 

But I don't have to be drunk to want to talk to them. I want to talk to them NOW. I want to hear their voice. Laugh at their stupid yet funny jokes. Snuggle up and watch movies. Have them laugh at my ""duckie"" face. But we can't get what we want sometimes. Lifes a bitch and so am I. Well I'm gonna go, I have to go jump in the shower.

Yeah I can feel the cleanness <----is that even a word??? I don't know, who cares???"

"event","Word to the wise. Before you judge me, walk a fucking mile in my shoes AND take a good long hard look at yourself. Before you say I'm so terrible and mean, take a good look inside your heart. Look what you have done to people. Look how you have treated them. Especially people that you have ""written off"". I'm sure that you will find you'll keep your mouth shut. 

I don't hate anyone. I have no reason to. Hate is a very strong word and should only be used when meant. I have said that I hate people but I really don't because of the meaning. I may strongly dislike some people but I don't hate them. 

It's funny how when people break up with people or are broken up with they go into a self destruction pattern. They say that they don't want to hear from the person and try to make it look like they are being stalked. Ha!! My problem is that I care too much what happens to the person I broke up with. Maybe I shouldn't. She has more than enough people caring about her. And I'm sure more than one of them would be more than happy to take her pain away from her. I was stupid and wrote an e-mail asking her how she was, what do I get, ""the one who hates me wrote me an e-mail"". NEWS FLASH--I don't hate you. Maybe it's easier for you to pretend that I hate you. Keep up with the illusion, if you want I'll help you."

When this began 
I had nothing to say 
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me 
I was confused 
And I'd let it all out to find 
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind 
Inside of me 
When all the vacancy the words revealed 
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel 
Nothing to loose 
Just stuck, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own 

I wanna heal 
I wanna feel 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long 
Erase all the pain till its gone 
I wanna heal 
I wanna feel 
Like Im close to something real 
I want to find something I've wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 

And I've got nothing to say 
I can't believe I didnt fall right down on my face 
I was confused 
Looking everwhere only to find 
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind 
So what am I 
What do I have but negativity 
Cause I cant justify the way everyone is looking at me 
Nothing to loose 
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own and the fault is my own

I want to find something Ive wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong 

I will never know 
Myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel 
Anything else, until my wounds are healed 
I will never be anything 
till I break away from me 
I will break away 
I'll find myself today

Breaking the Habit

Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safer in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
Who battles always choose
Cuz inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Cultured my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I have no options left again

I dont want to be the one
Who battles always choose
Cuz inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
Cuz I'm the one that falls
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Last Thursday I went to go see Twisted Sister with Andy and Hector. I was sooooo excited. I mean come on, how long have I been in love with Dee Snider. That's all I could talk about for weeks when I heard that he was playing after pretty suicide awhile ago. But I didn't get to go to that show. Ever since then I've been patiently waiting for someone to find out if or when Twisted Sister or just Dee would be playing. Finally Andy pulled through. So Andy, Hector and I went to the Meadowland's fair grounds and saw Twisted motherfucking Sister. It was AWESOME. i love Dee Snider even more then I use to. The orginal band was there in all their Twisted Sister make-up and out fits, it was great. I had so much fun.

Friday was the fourth. Blah, Blah, Blah. Fireworks and my cousin Mel came and visited me. Todd came with her. He's such a wonderful guy. I'm so glad that they are still together. It's nice to see that sometimes relationships CAN work out even though there are arguments. But anyway. They slept over. We all had fun.

Monday I went to a concert. Missy Elliot was there. Busta Rhymes, Fabolous(:P),50-cent, Jay-Z. It was nice. Fabolous sucked. Jay-Z got boring. MIssy was good. Busta was better. I had a good time. Few glitches but I don't want to talk about them.

But anyway. I'll be working more starting in September. So I guess if you want to see me you should see me before then cause the only free time i have is after work or on weekends. But I gotta do what I gotta do. Whatever. More soon. Later."

I don't want to sound bitchy but I wasn't about to spend that much money on someone who doesn't even want to spend time with me. But when I got to the jewelry store, I looked at the necklace and decided I'd take it anyway. The lady gave me a really nice discount. Really nice. I don't know though.

Well I told her it was in and she didn't sound that happy about it. Shit if someone was giving me something I really wanted I would be at least a little bit enthusiastic about it. It was almost as if I said hey babe the sun came up today.
Maybe I should have just gotten my money back. But when I saw that necklace I got this image of the look that would be on her face when I gave it to her and I had to get it. I love her so much. I just feel like we're going downhill again. I don't want that to happen. I love her very much and I want things to work out between us but if we aren't meant to be then we aren't meant to be. You can't beat a dead horse. Maybe this is a dead horse issue, and I'm the only one not seeing it. It's definately something I have to think about.

One thing is for sure, if I plan on getting my money back I have to go with someone who won't let me change my mind so that I'll do it this time. That way I won't have the chance to be a pussy. Oh well I'm gonna go now. later."

am i too lost?

my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation

do you remember me
lost for so long
will you be on the other side
or will you forget me
i'm dying praying bleeding and screaming
am i too lost to be saved
am i too lost?

my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation
my God my tourniquet
return to me salvation

my wounds cry for the grave
my soul cries for deliverance
will i be denied Christ
tourniquet
my suicide"

"event","Do you ever feel like you just want to disappear? That you matter to no one? I don't know I just feel so unimportant lately. Like if I just locked myself in a room for a couple of months no one would miss me. Well someone would miss me but I know of one person who wouldn't and that's the person who is really important to me. I just don't register on their radar lately. But whatever. Like they said, they are doing them, so I'm gonna go and do me. I'm gonna hang out with all my friends who I've been blowing off and I'm gonna be me again. I miss me. I guess in every relationship this is how things go. You spend every waking moment with each other and then slowly go back to your friends. Thus is life. It's no big crisis. Well I'm gonna go, I think i'm gonna go write. I haven't written in months!!!! 
Later."

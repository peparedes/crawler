Kimura Takuya and Beyonce???? In a handbag ad? I have no idea what the marketing people at Samantha Thavasa were thinking cuz that's one of the oddest pairings I've seen, but luckily they picked Kimutaku, [Warning: here I proceed to drool...] because he just about goes with anything. (Like strawberries n cream, floral table cloths and...high waisted pants. Hohohoho. Kidding. Not all together, of course.) And look at those features! The jawline! The nose! Just where does the man get his genes from?? I knew he was good looking, but man, in this picture, Beyonce's been relegated to the arm accessory."

"event","I feel brittle. Like I could snap at the slightest bit of pressure, applied the right way, taken the wrong way, anyway. 

I think it's cuz it's been a mad two weeks, largely fuelled by the adrenaline from one project that I perhaps shouldn't have taken so seriously. But, I worried (and worked) my way through it, submitted it, and am still waiting, nail gnawingly, for the okay signal from my bosses that the paper hit the mark and met their expectations. Nail gnawingly. It's been 5 days. 

Since then, I've fallen ill, gone on a day's MC, MISSED LILI's BIRTHDAY AUGH, returned to work and tried hard to wriggle out of two ego-clash sessions, only to find myself sliding right smack into the middle of BOTH. Having concluded an eventful week, I then proceeded to WORK THRU THE WEEKEND, yesterday, today, gone, gone, gone. I still have copious packing to do, and, oh, yes, more <i>werk</i>. Why is it always like that before I fly off??? Dear God, you who plan my life and order my days, is it too much to ask for a pre-travel lull week, for once? Or is it just my fault, for not having learnt whatever lesson there is to learn, the four or five times I've gone through this? (Which would put me squarely in the 'slow' class, I suspect). At least this time I've gone and bought all the necessities like travel pack tissues, extra moisturiser and random other jingalings I need in advance, so I don't need to run around so much.  

Am aware that this entry really juxtaposes with my previous post about being well rested. Ah, well. Reminder to self that rest cannot be hoarded, any more than daylight and youth, and...opportunities. Regular upkeep and topups would be the healthy, wealthy and wise way to go."

How was your Chinese New Year? 'Scuse me if I sound unbearably chirpy, I think I'm still pinging off the walls with excess energy from the amount of sleep I got over the long weekend. 

Here's a quick tally of how much credit I have in my sleepbank:
-Sunday, 25 Jan: 10.5 hrs (Sat to Sun) + 1.5 hrs (late morning nap) + 3 hrs (afternoon nap)
-Monday, 26 Jan: 8 hrs (Sun to Mon) + 4 hrs (afternoon nap)
-Tuesday, 27 Jan: 7 hrs (Mon to Tues) + 2.5 hrs (afternoon nap)

Are you not impressed???? I was a sleepsponge, in between very efficient visitation, a moderate amount of eating, some very communal tv watching (family bonding over chinese new year afternoon filler programmes!) and a few sleepy attempts to get some productive work done. 

I also rekindled my old love of silly WoW custom games, namely tower defense (and it's ten thousand variants) which involves strategic tower building to kill waves of creeps. CNY was good."

"event","Whee. Just like that, and it's been six months. The stuff I read in the news just six months ago is now painfully irrelevant, and I can generalise quite safely to say that there hasn't quite been a six months like the one we all just passed.

I've been to Peru and back (spent 3 days of my life criss-crossing timezones and continents and the inconvenient aisles of economy-class airtravel). I've been to Japan, deposited a part of my travel-loving self there and neeeeeeed to go back. -freaky addict gaze-

But more than my travels marking the passage of my time, what I've found noteworthy is that in the last 6 months, the day to day has had the surprising ability to capture my interest, and keep me happily busy. 

I still do like my work, and my colleagues very much. 
I discovered Gossipgirl (hur hur, bestfriend)
I celebrated my birthday, genuinely GLAD to be turning a year older.
I've had loud screaming matches with people, the likes of which I havent had since I was...pre-pubescent. 
I watched a startling number of foreign language dramas.
I'm still staunchly <i>not joining facebook</i>.
I've gotten more attentive about replying smses.
I've found a new place for facials! No more Leonard Drake and their patchy facial standards!
I've learnt that anger is a choice, like love and commitment, like tv channels and what to eat for lunch. And I've learnt that in the face of extreme stress, I can hold up, and still choose rationally. 
I've learnt that humble pie is an acquired taste that I can expect to spend the rest of my life acquiring. What makes it more palatable though, is first-hand experience that the alternative is often worse. 
I've learnt to cook decently! Now to keep practising. 
I realized that many of the things I thought I was good at were called to the test, and oftentimes I was found wanting. 
I didn't read as much as I would have liked to. 

There are so many many more things I learnt and experienced and felt in the second half of 2008. But enough about the past. Onwards to 2009!"

Hullo journal--I've been reminded of you, always and only incidentally, when I read articles about the ""connected youth of today"", for whom blogs, Web 2.0, and internet-speak are second nature. And just to make sure I'm a normal, connected youth, I run through this mental checklist: own a webjournal (check), user of Wiki (and other Web 2.0 sites) on a regular basis (check), basic html knowledge (check), communicate with friends regularly via online messaging applications (check). So you see, you serve only to assure me I'm normal--purely for my placement in the 'not-so-uncool' crowd. 

You also deal, stoically, with my faithlessness. I run to you only when I'm unbearably restless, angsty and need to vent, or when I'm feeling slightly exhibitionistic (or any combination of the 3). You've only ever eaten my post once, when I dithered too long over it for your liking, even though there are many many other posts that you should have eaten, for my own good, to stop me from adding to the massive amounts of personalized garbage in cyberspace.

As a record of the things I've done, felt, mused over, you're imperfect but significant. You're terribly biased and prone to slap-dash judgements based on precious little evidence, and your record is patchy, with huge chunks of my life missing between entries. Yet, even the ordinary moments you capture are worth remembering.

Oh, and I have to hand it to you, for your consistent networking. You have far more capacity, and constancy, in your wooing of my friends' journals than I sometimes have for my friends. Shame on me. And although this post was never meant to end up as a tribute to you, it is fitting that it turned out this way, because the only reason why I even logged in today was because I missed the time I spent with you."

"event","""For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.""
~1 Timothy 1:7 (KJV)

It occurred to me, in a sudden blitz of clarity, that I'm terribly fearful about my work. I'm been going around in this strange welter of depression recently, and it hits particularly when I a.) think about work b.) am at work. Given that I'm at work 5 days a week, and i can technically think about it 24/7, this means this black mood basically follows me around like an evil stalker that I cannot shake. 

And over the long weekend, while I was busy being busy and hating every single commitment that seemed to stave off more of my precious rest time, it suddenly hit me--this black mood I have, I can name. And, recognizing it as fear, plain, unvarnished and ugly, I suddenly realized why my eating has been out of whack, why my insides always feel so curled up, and why I've been so tensed and unhappy at work. That's a start, right? Once you've identified unknown substance X, you can begin to deal with it, slowly. 

I wasn't always fearful. But i guess, the longer I've been here, the more the pressure to perform, to <i>know better</i>, even as responsibilities mount. And with the recent release of bonuses, the sense is that the stakes are higher, the expectations elevated. And me, I've this desperate sense that I'm scrabbling, nails to the wall, limbs moving frantically but with not much progress to show for it. And I always, <b>always</b> feel like I'm not fast enough, not effective or efficient enough. And the ""try harder!"" solution I keep at doggedly just makes me feel more ineffective, and ten times more stupid than the average person, who seems to achieve simple tasks with a fraction of the effort, twice as quickly.

And it's at times like this, at the end of my own ability to do anything about it, that I can only cry out and ask for His assurance. How apt, your truths, O God, for even as my fears--rational, irrational, inexplicable--mount, you remind me of your presence through your word. Put last place in my day, yet you're patient enough to wait for me, gracious enough not to turn your face away from me. Dear Father, comfort my heart, ease my fears, even as I CHOOSE to trust in you, over ALL my fears. For it is you alone who assign me my portion and my cup, and favour comes from you alone, not from man. Teach me to raise my eyes from my narrow view of earthly things, and lift me to the rock that is higher than I."

Before I start, let me introduce you to Schnoogles, the intrepid, globe-trotting (PUN), four-legs-good-two-legs-bad, pig. This is Schnoogles at the train station at Anguk, the nearest station to where he stayed for a good part of the trip. This is a very very cool picture, and frankly, I'm not quite sure how I did it. Talent, I think it was just inborn talent. I will tell you more about Anguk later.

Ubiquitous street food, which we freakishly clean, hawker license-regulated Singaporeans don't get.</center>

I had grand plans to organize my photos and weave some sort of coherent thread thru them, tell a proper story so you'd be able to get a good idea of what I did, and why I love Korea. But it's been 4 months since the trip and I still havent composed my grand piece de resistance, so i've given up and will just provide little notes for each picture--bear with the randomness, friends.

N Seoul Tower! I was ill that day--I take to the cold poorly--but the cable car ride up was in daylight, and the view down was myeongdong by night, and it was very pretty. I think I have some blurred shots (they pass off as arty-farty) of the ride down. I don't remember enjoying much else cuz i was miserable and cold, other than the toilets having almost floor to ceiling windows with a view of seoul that felt like someone had thrown a giant map at your feet, because most stuff looked 2-D from the view above.</center>

And then we went to Krispy Kreme, which has the most amazing doughnut-making machine EVER. It's got little lifts for the doughnuts, and they are completely formed by machine, right from the ball of dough to the glazing under a fountain of liquid glaze, up and down and in and out and it's fascinating. And, as Krispy Kreme has the commendable habit of handing out free doughnuts, if you stand and gawp at the machine long enough, appreciative staff will come over and reward you for your homage.

"event","Back from San Francisco, and then Netherlands-Paris. It's been a short (admittedly un-typical) stint of jet-setting for work this year. And now, firmly grounded, I'm wondering how people can do this continuously as part of their job. Initially, travelling is gleeful fun, but I'm only beginning to realize, in a small way, the sacrifices and constant disruptions inflicted upon me, upon people around me, because of frequent travel. Count how many times I talked to you this year, friends. Take a random sample of how many times I talked to you within any two consecutive months last year, and you'll begin to see what I mean. Having to go thru the hassle of packing up, and then very quickly replacing all of your things in their proper drawers, cupboards, shelves back home aside, there's also the irritating inability to plan for anything in the short term. After some time, even the slight self-important air that one gets from brandishing a full schedule peppered with glitzy trips runs out, and you find yourself alone in an unfamiliar hotel room, with patchy internet connection, grey unwelcoming weather outside and you wonder why on earth you ever coveted a jet-set life.

Like for so many things, the romance of travel far outstrips its realities. Some places you like, some places make you miss home with sickening childishness. And all the time, what occurred repeatedly to me as I was overseas was the concept of 'home'. I think I reflected on this before, a few years back, in response to National Day. And my conclusion then was, for better or for worse, Singapore is my home. Through this season, from place to place, I find myself assessing each city and asking myself, searchingly, can I live here? Can I stay here and make this place as familiar to myself as Singapore is familiar to me? Regardless of whether I want to, is it even possible for me to efface the imprint of the place where I grew up, and adopt another? Understand that this ability would probably differ from person to person, correlated with factors like the ease with which one adapts to change, the ability to shed sentimentality, the degree of one's national pride, etc. 

Criss-crossing the continent gives you much time to navel-gaze. And after thinking about it, my answer is probably, scarily, most contradictarily, yes. If I <b>wanted to</b>, I think I could un-Singaporeanize myself. I currently don't want to, but I think if I wanted to, I could. And isn't that scary? Realizing that all that keeps me loyal to my country is my desire to be loyal? Trite, but you know how sometimes you think you're in some way protected from doing horrible things because you don't have the capacity to do them? An argument as weak as they come, I've realized. And one that bears remembering every time I start to get sanctimonious."

"event","Right. After I filled in the title bar, it suddenly occured to my perverted mind that there are people out there who might misconstrue the title. Agggghhhh MEL! This is YOUR DOING. I never confirmed-knew what the slang meant till your sms abt the doublemeaning. auughhhh. 

Anyway! I plod on. When I say spoon i mean 'cutlery', not more, not less. And I mean to announce my grand green plan, starting by not using plastic spoons anymore when I take away food. I started two weeks ago by bringing my metal spoon to work and refusing all plastic spoons from surprised hawker centre aunties. Tomorrow, I'm bringing chopsticks and a small tiffin carrier (yes they still exist) to work. I meant to bring them a week ago (yes before the newspaper article came out), but, being lazy and much inclined to the easy convenience of disposables, I've shamefully procrasinated and therefore chalked up more  meaningless waste. Sigh. But yes! This is a canvas for more spoon-toting, unabashedly green office-working types! There is so much we can do to treat this earth a little nicer, make the seas and skies less yucky, if only we bothered trying. I'm starting to bother, <b>why don't you?</b> 

Some things we could do:
-bring own spoon around, always
-bring chopsticks to work (saves the bleached bamboo thingys which always give splinters anyway)
-refuse plastic bags when buying small items/less than 3 items--they can all fit into your bag, if you're carrying a decent-sized bag
-be way more conscious about saving paper to be recycled, like boxes from cereal, envelopes, printed paper with one blank side
-print less stuff!
-BUY LESS STUFF. Consumerism is an awful culprit. But then, a culture cannot be a polluter unless people subscribe to it. So think three times about buying something if you can see yourself throwing it away in two, three years time. And by that same leave, (although this is tonnes harder) forget about buying useless stuff for people, because they'll probably be throwing it too. The threshold between what is 'useless' and what isn't is not clearly defined, true, but I think it's not such a copout to say we usually know when we're buying useless stuff. 

If you think of any more brilliantly inconvenient things to do, please tell me, and I'd be happy to see how I can adapt my lifestyle to be less wasteful and more earth hugging."

"event","Back from Korea again! This time, with truckloads of photos, the latter half of the batch all without optical zoom cuz i dropped the camera and thank God, only the zoom button spoilt so I was still able to take photos (or manually zoom as far out as my arm could go without falling out the window/off the mountain).

About eight hours after I touched down I attended Eeling's wedding, which was a lovely lovely small simple meaningful affair. Key learning points: 1.) Being a jie-mei is super fun! 2.) Shall wear pants or have a detachable train for my wedding (or both), given how ma fan a train is. And I don't even get to see the train, everyone else does. Completely unfair. 3.) Don't sweat the small stuff, and have as much fresh flowers as can possibly be viable for everything! Hair, car, dress, deco, flowers flowers flowers! (:

Now clearing mail and various other minor errands needed to get back into routine again. Next year shall be Japan year, I have decided, with all the imprudence of someone who has not yet looked at her finances. hahaha. 

Looking forward to the Christmas season! Came back to find the tree in the office has been put up, the fake presents all decked out in bows and tinsel and the lights a-dancing. It's like I jumped from holiday season straight back into holiday season! Whee."

"event","Here's complete decadence for you: Boss today came back from New York and gave me a cookie that's so big it weighs half a pound. How's that for instant weigh gain huh? -licks fingers-

Okay indulge me with what comes next. A lot of the references would probably leave most who don't watch jdoramas (the Anglicized name of what Jap drama serials are called) scratching their heads, but I've been craving the exercise of writing down some of the thoughts which have been swimming round my head on this issue.

<i>From DramaWiki: ""TBS announced in August of 2007 that there will be a live action movie for Hana Yori Dango coming out in the summer of 2008. The cast will remain the same, but the script will likely be different.""</i>

Whee~! hahaha. Excuse the complete fangirlism, am now watching Ikemen Paradise (the Japanese verison of Hana Kimi) and completely enjoying myself. The show also raises similar gay-tension issues as Coffee Prince (a Korean serial that's managed to attain arthouse chic AND mass-market appeal at the same time, haha oxymoron of sorts) where one of the characters falls for the girl but thinks he's going completely nuts cuz she's a 'boy' and while it takes a fairly light-hearted, non-angsty treatment of a serious subject, I like how it isn't dismissive of the struggle. 

Okay but back to the announcement for HYD the movie. I'm bringing up Ikemen Paradise cuz like HYD, it's a manga adaptation, and I've found that I'm beginning to like, very much, how the Japs do manga adaptations. I like how they keep to the 9-12 episode structure with an almost moral rigidity, because it forces them to be very disciplined about what goes into the plot and forces them to discard what is essentially just sentimental indulgence on the director's/producer's/scripwriter's part. This means the pace is often quick, extremely gratifying to watch, and the storytelling is clever. I like how they cover ground without having to actually SHOW it, sometimes, by using simple devices like flashbacks, or voice-overs where one character recounts to another, or, get this, they assume their audience is intelligent, and it's merely implied! Brilliant! Saves time! Less unneccessary stuff!

And I love how the Japs take the same story and make into a completely unique work of art while adapting it for tv. I think it takes courage and confidence to tear apart an already very successful piece of work (i.e. the manga, as it is usually the famous mangas that are adapted) and rework it for the medium of tv, while keeping the essence of it authentic. That's why it's called adaptation, which involves being creative with making the neccessary changes, and not conversion, or copying, or some other word that implies less creativity and less effort in understanding what lies at the heart of each original work and how to bring that out. 

I frankly think jap serials would make for interesting study...where else would you get a.) a manga version (already a very visual form of storytelling); b.) an anime version; and c.) a live action drama version of the same story?? Three different media, all extremely visual, and three very different ways of telling the story. It would be interesting to see how the various pivotal scenes are translated into each medium, and across media, as well as how the strengths of each medium bring across emotions, tensions and character quirks.

Beyond the unique availablility of various versions of the same work, and even beyond the deftness and creativity of the adaptations done, I'm often struck by the thought and cleverness that go into even the most mass-market, fluffy, teen-idol dramas, the kind that you and i would write off and scoff at. I watched Ikemen just intending to be entertained at the most superficial level (eye-candy, a fun but not very original or realistic storyline), but was pleasantly surprised at the way some of the little details were handled.

For example. There's a brilliant scene where Nakatsu finds out that the 'gold bars' that he and Mizuki (whom he likes) have just won in the dance competition are actually just chocolate-wrapped bars, and also confirms, in almost the same scene, his devastating suspicion that Mizuki doesn't like him, but likes his best friend, Sano. Get this: Mizuki is a girl dressed as a boy in an all-boys school. Nakatsu has liked her even before he found out she was a girl, and he went through this whole I-might-be-gay thing, before he finally accepted that he didn't care what liking Mizuki makes him, he's going to like him (her) anyway, even if he's (she's) straight and not into boys and he therefore has no sporting chance. THEN he finds out he's actually a she, and he's overjoyed, thinking it's all going to work out. And then comes the dance competition, which they work very hard for, and he's thinking he wants nothing more than to win the competition with Mizuki and win the gold bars. The parallels drawn in the scene where he finds out that a.) yes, he's gotten what he wants, he's won, but the gold bars are really just chococlate and not what he thought they were and b.) Mizuki may be a girl, again he's gotten what he wants, but it's still no good and he still has no chance with her, are played to amazing poignancy. 

The bestest part is when Nakatsu, visibly upset after confirming that he stands no chance with Mizuki, is being congratulated in a wildly happy scene by all his oblivious classmates for winning the competition. They chant for him to give a speech and propell him to the front of the crowd, forcing him to accept his chocolate bars and expecting him to give the typical speech of joy after his victory. And as he stands there clutching the chocolate, you're watching his face work as he tries to decide if he has the courage to turn and bolt. Right up to the moment before he opens his mouth to speak, you're dead sure he's either going to say something rude like screw the stupid chocolate, or turn and walk off. But what he does is a complete surprise--he starts by sounding a little shaky, but he pretends thru the whole speech like the gold bars are really gold, and gives the same old happy-go-lucky Nakatsu attitude so well that the juxtaposition with what he really feels couldn't have been more effective. And the irony, as the crowd roars and he walks out of the hall, is devastating. Brilliantly executed scene, brilliant acting, and incredibly nuanced, for a drama aimed at teenage girls who would probably not notice much beyond the pretty faces of the leads. Who would have thought?

This is just one of quite a few examples that struck me. There are also several understated, layered scenes, with such rich characterization I'm left wondering if my disc got fused with some other arthouse flick by accident. Whatever happened to my flaky drama? 

Of course, i also love the silliness of jdoramas, and how they never take themselves too seriously, and somehow manage to insert the most inapproriately FUNNY scenes into the storytelling. I think what i want to say here is that they usually have a lot of fun, and it shows, which makes me happy. hahaha.

Okay! impromptu thesis on jap shows aside, I'm pleased and worried abt HYD the movie coming out at the same time. Pleased, because the story continues, and after following 20 episodes of the Tsukushi-Domyoji romance, it's nice to see them grow up and move on. Worried, because I thought the drama had a pretty neat ending, and with the movie coming up, the phrase hua-she-tian-zhu comes to mind. I hope they aren't bowing to (immense) fangirl pressure to keep spinning stuff off the insanely profitable HYD franchise, because the japs have always been pretty disciplined abt things like that...no serials of serials, no silly spin-off series and thereby flogging a theme/story to death. So anyways. I await the HYD movie with....much anxiety. I hope they give Oguri Shun (hanazawa hui) good hair, cuz his hair in Ikemen P suxxx1000. How did the Japanese, who came up with Gatsby and a million other hair products for every style under the sun, manage to screw up Oguri Shun's hair???"

"event","I'm going to Korea again, me pretties! This makes it..uh, the third time in less than 12 months. I know, I know, what's the obsession right? I don't know, except that going there makes me happy. I'm not going to psychoanalyze it with my Japan-going obsession, because the thought of going to Japan fills me with awful apprehension; it's all heart-lurching desire and equal parts fear that I won't ever get to go, or that I'll lose the passion/courage to move there when the time comes to let go and leave. The thought of going to Korea, though, fills me with warm happiness, like going back to something I know was good, and familiar, and I know I won't feel horribly lost and alone there. 

I thought about it. And realized that some part of me needs to move overseas somewhere and throw myself in and put myself as far out of my comfort zone as borders masochism, just to see how I adapt and survive. I think it's like going for harder and harder goals or, um, wanting to earn more and more money, depending on what you derive your kicks from, or what you need to stretch yourself to grow, to put it more positively. 

Finished reading Persuasion--it's one of the Austens that I knew next to nothing about, and since my cousin had it conveniently on her table when I went over for tuition, I picked it up and i now realize why it isn't quite as famous as the rest. Quick off-the-top-of-my-head reasons why: the story isn't quite as compelling, perhaps because the supporting characters aren't built up as richly, and also chiefly, I think, because the character of the male protagonist isn't as developed. The ending felt like Austen was getting tired of sustaining the enigma of Captain Wentworth. I loved how it began, though. There was such promise, in her characterization of Anne's father and sisters.

Oh oh oh and I found pretty shoes that I am going to buy: Converse! Take a look.

Pleased grinning all round. My Nikes are dying and I need proper shoes that don't pinch my toes. Wearing heels during weekdays to work just makes me want to wear stuff that's the complete antithesis of what yinyin calls my 'proper shoes' during weekends. I LOVE these Converses! I've always been abit undecided abt Converse; they're not the crowd pleasers that Nike Dunks are, and they're far harder to carry off. But these are the first Converses I've fallen in love with on my own two feet (as opposed Converses on other people's feet, which seem to be easier to fall for), and since the moon and stars are in alignment (i.e. I actually NEED shoes)....-pauses- Looking at my rambly paragraph I'm tempted to throw in a Polonious-type statement here like: ""brevity is the soul of wit"", before proceeding to declare that, in short, I'm buying them. And just so I can run the point as dry as a desert-bleached bone, I AM buying them, with mirth and glee and the funny bouncy frothy happiness that one gets from buying nice shoes that were sort of exactly what you wanted, only you didn't know it until they happened right in from of you. Is this what being in love is like? You talk and talk and make so many rounds around the subject you lose even your most ardent friends; you annoy yourself, but you can't stop bubbling over, you just have to tell everybody. -trots off in glee-"

Wednesday September 26, 2007

<b>factotum \fak-TOH-tuhm\, </b>noun:
A person employed to do all kinds of work or business. 

Such an elegant word. I believe we over here have a more graphic (and appropriate) phrase for the same, it's called <i>doing sai(2) kang(1)</i>. Over there, it's titular. Here, the focus is on the task, with the sense of it being distasteful, yes, but fleeting; an accidental assignment; a bad pitstop before moving on to better things. Like: I may be <i>doing sai kang</i> now, but in two months I'll ORD. hahahahaha. This amused me greatly. 

And indeed, it is a day for trivial amusements. I don't feel productive. I woke up on the side of the bed labelled ""thinking-too-much"", which puts one in a sort of belligerent discontent with everything. Without sense, without reason, with complete disregard of evaluative judgement and shedding even the ever preserving rememberance to be thankful for what I already have that usually keeps me in check, <i>I want to move to Japan <b>NOW</b></i>."

"event","I haven't done this in awhile. This, being staying up late with the family all asleep, with only the laptop for company. Doing frivolous stuff. Like updating the journal. Being <i>on msn</i> (though not actually talking to anyone on it, but it's the <u>possibility</u> of having midnight msn conversations that counts).  

Had the most frustrating, maddening, ridiculously confounding conversation with my mum abt an issue that neither of us really cared to have a strong opinion about. But somehow, we ended up at the pole ends, fighting for the extremes as if our idealogical beliefs depended on it. She could have been speaking swahili and I some other esoteric language, for all the progress we made. And I ended up so blooming mad I was on the verge of being downright rude just for the horrible pleasure of hurting her. It's been awhile since I got this close to throwing all notions of self-control aside, esp with regard to my parents. Just when I was upbraiding yinyin for not exerting self-control too! -gets poked squarely in the eye by Irony- I got so mad I loaded up my computer and began to finish work i hadn't meant to finish quite so soon.

Week past has been extremely eventful, so eventful that I don't quite know where to start. Like every well-meaning person with a lot of things to accomplish in a limited period of time, I shall tackle the most frivolous things first. Having been stuck in Shangri-la for the past week, (more on why I was stuck there later) I have discovered, amongst other pertinent findings, that there is an extremely CUTE staff working at the front desk there. While I have neither name, age, vital stats or photo, I proffer, my darling devotees, my infalliable assurance that he is CUTE. heh. Feels good, this eye candy gushing. It's been awhile. 

So so so. Why I was at Shang. I was working as a liaison officer for a series of meetings involving foreign dignitaries, and even though I was working 15 hours a day and through the weekend, I enjoyed myself thoroughly and would recommend the job of liaison officer to anyone who likes interacting with people. It wasn't easy and the hours were long, yes. But it got me out of the office, I got to meet and mingle with people of different nationalities, I learnt a whole new, different set of skills and I found I was good at it. I found that I could like and serve people who initially didn't think very much of me. I liked making my delegates happy. I liked seeing their opinion of me change for the better as I kept at trying my best. It was a good week.

Back in the office, much drama was ensuing, and there's been a huge shuffle in upper and middle management. Gossip is rife and work has kinda come to a standstill, morale is at an all-time low; if you wrote a movie script about an office drama my office has probably got about 70% of the required plot twists. I am extremely glad I was out of the office. God really protected me, and kept me out of the storm.

More news another time maybe, I say blithely aware that another time will probably not come. The unsaid words this time will likely remain unsaid, some stories will likely remain untold. But let me end with this: the breakfast buffet at Shang is freaking GOOD."

lots of things happen in the spaces between diary entries. The unrecorded slips of life we allow to fall between the pages only to find them wedged firmly in our memory. A smile, a word, a turn of phrase, the slant of a neck, the way the light catches under your brow. Let them be unrecorded no longer. In quick recap, here's what happened to my oh-so-eventful life between thursday night and saturday morning, 20 mar 2003 and 22 mar 2003: 

(in chronological order, starting thursday night) 

1.) I got locked out of the house at 1050pm, when I went to meet Yin and pass her stuff. When I came back, the house was all dark and I was locked out, keyless and handphone-less. Such a throwback to primary school days, when I had to run downstairs and across the road for a public phone whenever I got locked out. I ended up getting back in only at 1230, miserable, angry and unable to do the work I'd planned to do. While waiting, I'd climbed into the Senior Citizen's corner at the void deck of the adjoning block and sat there for close to two hours to wait and think. Nothing but your own thoughts for company. And a Bangledeshi worker with a very chirpy handphone. Hum. 

There was someone else asleep, illegally, at the Senior Citizen's corner, with a deck chair and boards to hide him away from prying eyes. He was behind a board, barely two metres away from me. All I could see were his toes and a pair of rubber slippers, laid very neatly beside his deck chair, soles pressed together. It was quite surreal, watching the fan blow, turn, click, rhythmically, hearing the gentle croon of breath from a perfect, faceless stranger, and me, crouched over the concrete stool, trying not to feel so miserable and out of place in the Senior Citizen's corner. 

2.) I went to the LaSalle-SIA open house on friday, and it was such an euphoric feeling of liberation, being in the company of people doing exactly what they wanted to do, not bothered by the ""economic viability"" and ""commercial value"" of a fine arts degree. I felt almost embarassed to ask about job prospects from the students we found when we crashed into the printmaking studio illegally. It was like art for arts sake; heck, if you like it and can get your highs from what you create, why can't you be happy with that and live with that? I would like to say I can't be happy with just that, but I suspect this whole obsession with ""economically viable degrees"" is just a state of mind, more an indoctrination than a personal, self-found belief. 

But that said, there's always something to be said about being practical in your pursuits. I don't subscribe to the poor artist living in a garrett picture of stylized poverty anymore than I believe happiness is the only thing you need to survive. You also need a meal ticket. Lucky those who like doing practical, ""economically viable"" (it crops up again!) things then. In my wildest dreams I graduate with three degrees from LaSalle: Fashion Design, Communications Design, and Fine Art. In my wildest dreams. To heck with my damn BSc. 

4.) This is also LaSalle related. I've found the sculpture that I aim to buy ten years' from now, when I'm rich and successful and earning the profits from that damn BSc. See? I have to have an incentive for continuing where I am, and it comes in the form of a tall, thin, sinuous black statue. My current love is called Agony, made by Brother Joseph McNally. I spotted it in the LaSalle sculpture finishing studio and it's got such a lovely finish and such lovely curves when it catches the light that I want it, want it. I couldn't keep my greedy hands off it, gently stroking, running my fingers up and down the ebony resin shape of an impossibly proportioned human being with arms crossed above his head. Oh, it also costs $45, 000 bucks. Ten years, ten years. Wait ten years. It's like buying two-thirds of a toyota-corolla, in present-day real costs. 

3.) I read the scripts of Mergers and Accusations and Wills and Seccessions! This was lovely, only I kept imagining Eleanor Wong herself as Ellen Toh, and I can't shake the awful suspicion that when I go and pay $75 bucks to watch the triple bill, Tan Kheng Hua as Ellen Toh will disappoint simply because she's not the Ellen Toh in my mind's eye. It's unfair, it's unfair, but I will still watch the triple bill anyway. Assuming I remember to buy the tickets from Sistic! 

Well that's it for my little life. I would say ""in a nutshell"" except that I've realized I've written an awful lot and I've never seen a nut this big. So it's out with nutshells. ""Oh I could be bound in a nutshell, and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I had bad dreams."", so said Hamlet. This is from memory, and I'm sure I'm misquoting it horribly, but I can say with certainty that at least there's the words 'nutshell', 'king of infinite space' and 'bad dreams' in the original quote. I never liked shakespeare anyway. 

In other news, war has started with Iraq, and Channel News Asia has gotten a lot more colourful as most of the time, they're showing exerpts from US news agencies with solemn looking anchors reading too many stats for me to absorb. In the papers today the editor of The Economist, Bill Emmott, predicts the war will last 3 months. That's short by most standards but then whose standards are those? History's, where they had hundred year wars? America's, the world's? How about the fact that suffering is unbound by time, and hell on earth can last a day and feel like eternity? But we keep to prudent estimates, unmarred by subjectivity and undue violent emotion. So, three months is a short time."

"event","This review...I read it ages ago, in a copy of TIME magazine my bro brought home. And I remember back then, I loved it immediately, in the weird hero-worshipping way I loved, and still love, good writing. This time, I was reminded of it again while reading the review of Jay Chou's much hyped I'm-proving-to-the-world-I'm-a-multi-talented-popstar movie debut, Secret, when Life! quoted it's last line in reference to Jay Chou's co-star, Guey Lun-Mei. 

Ach, it's still good, and although now I still love it for it's writing and I can smile indulgently at remembered angst, I'm not quite sure if it works as a <i>good</i> movie review, other than making me want to like the show very very much, even without having watched it. It's perhaps...too involved? It's a fine line, this movie reviewing thingamyjig. Enjoy, noneless.

<b>A Taipei Love Triangle 
Monday, Jul. 28, 2003 
By BRYAN WALSH 
</b>

With the possible exception of ""Christian Slater vehicle,"" few words chill the heart of a movie critic faster than ""coming-of-age story."" Before the sepia tones have drenched the opening frames, we already know what we're in for: turgid nostalgia, with teenage protagonists not so much living as waiting around for their by-the-numbers life-changing experiences. The Taiwanese film Blue Gate Crossing grasps, however, that adolescence is more than a sweetly remembered holding pattern for adulthood. The story of two Taipei high-school girlfriends and the boy who comes between them, Blue Gate Crossing achieves innocence without naivete; sweetness without sacrificing realism. Its characters fall in and out of love but never quite manage to come of age. They're too busy living. 

What they're living is a teen-pop-love triangle with a k.d. lang twist. Girlish Yueh-chen (Liang Shu-hui) has an obsessive crush on her blithe classmate Zhang Shi-hao (the F4-quality cutie Chen Bo-lin). Too shy to talk to Zhang, Yueh-chen feeds her imagination by collecting or stealing his pens and papers, old water bottles and basketball shoes, like a devotee hoarding a saint's relics. Yueh-chen even resorts to sending her best friend, tomboy Meng Ke-rou (Guey Lun-mei), to feel out Zhang, which she promptly, and literally, does. Zhang falls for Meng, Yueh-chen worships Zhang, and as for Meng, well, she's not sure which one she wants to smooch. So she kisses both, with mixed results. 

The beauty of Blue Gate Crossing is in its summery, sedated atmosphere. Writer-director Yee Chin-yen likes to repeat shots, sequences, even whole lines of dialogue: Zhang piloting his bicycle through Taipei's streets, Hawaiian shirt fluttering behind him; Yueh-chen writing her crush's name over and over in perfect characters; Meng hugging her school desk, staring hard at the girl she doesn't want to love. It all adds up to the diffident burn of an adolescent season, the sense of sameness that circumvents time, until time hits back. ""You're 17, the summer's over and you haven't done anything,"" Meng says near the end of the film. It's a shrug of a line but not a mere dismissal; when you're 17, you want and you hate with the same casual intensity. 

Yee also has a sure hand for the way teenagers communicate or, rather, don't. Zhang struggles to understand Meng, and Meng struggles to understand herself; eventually the two just resort to shoving each other, which ends up working best of all. Chen has a smile as winning as his personality and a guileless befuddlement that plays well off Guey's nerves. Guey, a high-school student Yee discovered on the street, is a real teenager, emotionally opaque save for moments of piercing transparency when her pain and confusion overwhelm her. It's then, as feelings flicker across her moony eyes, that we can watch someone coming of age the way it actually happens: second by second, heartbreak by heartbreak."

"event","It's twelve noon and I've done practically nothing. Well. loading up this journal and deciding, most suddenly, to update doesn't quite add to my (work) productivity either, but do you see me looking behind my shoulder lest I get turned into a pillar of salt? Noooooo. I am looking ahead, looking ahead, my darlings, for whatever the next turn of the road will bring my way; tears, joy, success, failure, humility, learning, definitely more learning for the heart, for the soul, for the mind. 

My boss tendered her resignation, and I'm still figuring out how much damage my system sustained. I'm systematically gearing up, preparing myself for missing my boss, like one prepares oneself for a race or some long-distance, pain-inducing ritual. She's been clearing out her room, and popping by ever so often to bestow me with random knickknacks like: a scarf with the london skyline, a set of coasters, a (dusty) bear (called Pete) and various documents. I now have all these things that will remind me of her. And lots and lots of emails, for which I'm not quite sure if I'm being the sentimental fool about for not deleting. This is how much I'll miss my boss. Ach. So the world is full of comings and goings.

Okay I shall trundle off to go do something more productive, something that might actually be part of my jobscope, for example. Bad testimony corrine, bad!

Oh one last thing! I was reading someone's blog which had a feature where one of those autoplay songs go on the moment you load up the page...and i found myself humming to it while idly surfing the site. And then! I suddenly realized! The song sounded familiar in that horrible dawning kinda way like when you recognize an old crush who KNEW about your crush. DUM DUM DUM! And I realized! It was Paris Hilton's awful aful song. *doleful* Can I still be saved????"

"event","<i>""Hear my cry, O God; 
       listen to my prayer. 
 From the ends of the earth I call to you, 
       I call as my heart grows faint; 
       lead me to the rock that is higher than I.""  
~Psalms 61:1-2</i>

I realized, looking back today, that it's been a gruelling two weeks. Just remembering what I did exactly a week from yesterday makes my head ache, the same kind of achy feeling you get after, say, being stretched out on a rack and your limbs are being winched further and further apart with terrifying regularity, like the bell after every lesson back when you were in school. No, I jest. There's nothing like tragi-comedy for making me take a second, hard look at my terrifying capacity for self-pity. It <b>has</b> been a gruelling two weeks though. That much, I maintain, with the clearest bit of, um, clarity I can muster right now, can stand up when held to objective light. 

Anyways. This is not an entry about how I crawled out of bed, dog tired, was determined to grouch through my day and thought, oh for the upteenth time!, about how much I hated having to live from task to task, like my life was one big television lineup, with no spare time and where nothing stands still for a minute, AND with a precise five minutes between each programme for ad breaks. Harh. Look! More self-pity masquerading as lucid prose! Look how easily it slips out of me, <i>this kind of things no need to practice one</i>. What a marvellous job I'm doing juxtaposing my text with the verse above though, all me, me, me, me. Which brings me nicely back to my point, actually. The verse--one of many which leapt at me when I was chafing in my head against having to wake up and face a full day of work n activities (I got no energy, Lord. Humanly, I need a break. Can't I just lie and get an MC? Why must life be so difficult blah blah yadda yadda yadda...) made me remember why I invest my time and energy believing and in whom I believe. The Psalms were written when David was running for his life, despite the fact that time and again, he had spared the life of the man who was seeking to kill him. Full of urgent need for strength, encouragement, protection, assurance. David probably knew, humanly, that he would probably go crazy if he didn't set his sights higher than eye level, where as far as he could see, everything around him suckked. What David DIDN'T know, was that what he wrote would be recorded for posterity, and would one day come back and hit a 23 year old chinese girl with all the force of brick. <i>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</i> When things snowball and I get helplessly subsumed by all the collateral damage from the crap people throw around, <i>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</i> When I'm squeezed from every side, <i>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</i> When I'm tired, lonely, frustrated, confused, angry, hurt you list the adjective I'll tell you how I cope: <i>Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</i> Oh, for a perspective and a strength that never wavers, lead me to a rock that is higher than I."

Korea was fantabulous, I wanna mooooove there and live there and love the place not just as a tourist but as a bonafide resident. Photolog to be posted AS SOON AS I CAN COBBLE HALF AN UNINTERRUPTED HOUR TOGETHER sheesh and unpack the sediments that have collected from living out of suitcases and various overnight duffles for two plus weeks. Desaru was pretty good too, got a few pictures for that but was mostly too busy running after my babysitting charges to take photos. Kids amaze me, I find myself staring at their miniature perfect features and fully functioning faculties, and marvel at how much they understand so intuitively (even when all I want to do is give them a good spanking). The wonder of a child...is something I don't quite know how to put in words without being afraid of my words coming out bland, ordinary, or worse, trite. I'm still apprehensive like crazy about it's ever going to be possible to have at least two kids, raise them to have rock-solid values, and, uh, maintain a loving, relationship with <i>their father</i> for 30, 40 years all at the same time??? But! I digress. It's good to be back, although I still can't watch planes take off without a slight pang in my heart, thinking, <i>what is there out there that I'm missing just by being comfortable back here?</i>

Anyways. Came back to the office this morning to a reallyreally good surprise. Am still v v stunned from it, but oh Father God, you are faithful, and I still have so much to learn. Teach me the language of thankfulness, I who am so untutored. A word, two words, let me babble my praise."

"event","A surreal moment happened in Japanese class yesterday: We were going through the drills of conjugating verbs (I love how systematic Japanese verbs are!), when my teacher introduced an unfamiliar verb, ""shinu"", and told us that it followed the same conjugation pattern (negative form, polite form, dictionary form conditional form, volitional form, 'te' form) that we had been learning. She then said: okay, repeat after me, and proceeded to bring us verbally through the conjugation of that verb. After we had dutifully repeated the whole string of the verb after her, she said, with a deadserious face, do you know what this verb means? (A non-sequitur, since we obviously had no bliddy idea what the verb meant). And with the same deadserious face, she said, it means to die. Now, repeat after me again, class: (in Japanese) I don't die, I am going to die, I die, I should die, I plan to die, please die. And, being the brainless-robot Singaporeans that we are, the class obediently opened their mouths and repeated after her their collective intention to expire, albeit most politely expressed. I don't know if the irony hit anybody else, but it was crazily absurd for a fleeting moment there, that calm nonchalance in the face of a lip-serviced death."

"event","Don't you think 'orangery' is such a lovely word? For me, the word conjures up intense colour-rich images of lush green fields, a mediterranean joire de vivre, dappled sunlight and the tang of rows and rows of nearby fresh ripening oranges on the breeze. Such broad strokes of colour accompanied by a whole dizzy array of smells, sights, possibilities. A word, such power. <i>My mind is on holiday, somewhere in Italy</i>. 

I am, obviously, stuck somewhere that's the complete antithesis of that. It's only when you're somewhere completely uninspiring that the breathtaking clarity of <i>where else you'd rather be</i> kicks in."

"event","It occurred to me, I say diffidently while examining my nails, that I actually have a lot of work to do today. Well, more than my usually manageable workload, at least. On an ordinary busy-type day I would be huffingpuffing rushing, getting all task oriented and mentally ticking off my list of things to do, chafing at the extra minute wasted, etc etc etc. Trot out any number of typical task oriented behaviours and i would probably be a textbook exhibit. But not today. Today I got up with a lump in my chest that beat, beat, beat down upon me, and all I wanted to do was to throw on my invisible cloak and <i>disappear</i> from the world in a puff of swirling smoke. Oh damn all these busy-ness, if I were to worry one whit more, it would probably make me feel less shitty, but I just can't summon up the energy to try. In addition to worrying being completely pointless, I hasten to add.

In other news. It hasn't been that way for awhile. 

In other other news. When has it been since I wanted to smile like that? A warm, tummy originating, completely unplanned, unfurled smile? I smiled so hard my cheeks must have retained the memory of it long after, maybe even programmed the pattern of that smile into my facial creases.  And the weird stab of buoyancy that accompanied it. From where, from where, from where?

I should tell everyone the albino cocoa beans story that joel and I came up with after consuming, most rapidly, a whole pot of chocolate fondue. High on fresh fruits and cocoa beans~! I sing, in tune with Suede's Beautiful Ones. 

I should also tell everyone how I have all these devious thoughts about skipping lunch and oh, dropping a waist size, only when it comes to lunchtime I throw all these resolutions out the window and go eat heartily at Amoy or something. But! today I ran. At the gym. I ran, and felt like I could have run for hours. It was a good feeling."

"event","I woke this morning with the Jason Mraz song, I'm Yours, in my head. Or rather, not so much with the song per se, but with the slightly folksy clenched strum of the beat in my mind. Which surprised me, because the last time I heard the song was when bestfriend posted it on her journal, in an incredibly incredibly sweet video someone made for her friends' wedding. The song must have made a bigger impact on me than I initially thought, to have lain dormant in my mind for so long and surfaced, unexpectedly, almost three? four? months later like this, on an unguarded morning.

So then, can you guess what I'm listening to now??? *grin*

I'm waiting to see how long it takes before the song gets <i>jelat</i>. I love how jason mraz makes falling in love sound so light and fluffy, like well beaten eggs and sugar, like a walk in the park on a warm sunny morning with the day stretching blessedly free ahead of you. Like, like, like so many of the warm fuzzy lovely things that happen to you that you don't quite know how to describe to someone else because they're <i>yours</i>, so intimately, and no amount of clever words your expensive education brought you can quite pin it down."

"event","<b>Love and Marriage...</b>
I finally know whom I want to be when I grow up: I want to be Cate Blanchett. I say this with the same inimitable steely serenity that she brings to the characters she plays. From Elizabeth's Elizabeth I to LOTR's Galadriel, An Ideal Husband's Lady Gertrude to The Aviator's Katharine Hepburn. Always the epitome of <i>woman</i>--strong, terrible, feminine, brilliant, beautiful. But the clincher, the clincher, was when she said in an interview--I think it was either in TIME magazine or in a tv interview--that a key factor of her success derives from the fact that her husband adores her and has always unstintingly supported her work; even on her worst days, he thinks she's a goddess who somehow landed on the pillow next to him (here, I paraphrase liberally, but the sentiment remains the same and the phrase ""He adores me"" really stuck in my mind and hence is pretty much ad verbatim.) And I thought, o you lucky woman, on top of everything else, to have this. Then it struck me that so few successful women can lay claim to the same. It seems to be either success or marriage, career or love. 

So when I say, Cate Blanchett, I want to be you, I'm really saying: Beyond success in my career, which everybody wants (duh), I want the serenity and security you radiate, not because of where you are, but because you seem to be at peace with yourself, because your marriage isn't falling apart, because your husband adores you, and because in an industry of beautiful people you stand out with an undefinable grace. 

<b>Go together like a horse and carriage...</b>
All drivers of dark green Honda Civics, you better watch out. Yesterday on my way to work, as I was walking past the Chinatown area, I got honked at, in an extremely rude fashion, by the driver of a dark green Honda Civic. This was ostensibly because I was walking too far out onto the road instead of keeping docilely to the pavement, thereby blocking his way. This was especially galling because a.) There is NO PAVEMENT. CARS PARK ALONG THAT ""PAVEMENT"" b.) There is, however, a five-foot-way that I could, theoretically, have been walking along, EXCEPT THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY METAL POTS AND ASSORTED PARAPHERNALIA because the uncle of the shop unloads his vans in an extremely expansive fashion at the exact time I walk past to get to work every morning; and c.) the little old auntie who collects boxes was pushing a HUGE cart of boxes and was attempting to trundle out of the side lane and I was making space for her. 

So, the story goes, I was attempting to balance all these onerous considerations and somehow wandered a little too far onto the road. Just as I managed to identify the thrilling <i>new</i> sound--the low growl of a motor--that assailed my ears, I heard two short, strident, extremely loud honks meant exclusively for me. From behind me roared a--yes, you guessed it--dark green Honda Civic, at whose behind I glared very malovently until it turned the corner out of sight. There was certainly space on the road to accomodate me, the little old lady and the car. The road is the same one on which they open two rows of stores every CNY for the night market, i.e. I am trying to tell you it is WIDE. You, the driver of the dark green Honda Civic whose number plate I neglected to memorize because I was in such a haze of injured anger, have consequently become the villian in my little anecdote-with-a-moral.

So my moral is simply this: there is NO WAY to honk politely at a person. Haha. Okay fine, that's a lousy moral that doesn't quite follow from...anything. There wasn't really a moral to begin with because I started this section merely wanting to rant, but the exercise of writing it all down made me get all pious and self-righteous, and along the way in sneaked this high-sounding <i>moral</i>. *laughs at self* So maybe the real message of the story should be: don't be so hasty, take a moment to stop and evaluate before making a judgement. *deadpans* ESPECIALLY when you're in a big roaring car and the person you honk at actually has a pretty good reason for being where she is on top of there actually being enough space for you to drive safely past. Haha. Okay I feel slightly more vindicated now.

<b>It's an institute you can't disparage...</b>
Ann, Cance, remember how I said I was impressed with the copywriting in the Uniquely Singapore ads in TIME magazine? Um, I retract that. I've just found an ad in the same series that has completely undone any sort of esteem I had for the campaign. Sample this:

[a close-up picture of a couple with a child playing at a fountain in Sentosa, complete with splashy water and palm trees in the background.]

[main caption, in large text] We were caught in a shower on a bright and sunny day.

Who can resist playing with water? It refreshes the soul and unleashes your inner child. <u>Such spontaneity and innocence abound in Singapore,</u> a city like no other. It is an ever-changing mosaic of fascinating contrasts. One that can be appreciated with grown-up awe as well as childlike wonder. From raves to symphonies, from experimental dance to butterfly parks, Singapore offers you an experience so uniquely enthralling, it's <i>beyond words</i>. [underline mine]

Helllllooooooo. Are we trying to get people to ridicule us or visit us? Plus. Unleash your inner child??? Singapore, the place that previously, and most infamously, banned chewing gum??? Plus, since when have we been so devoid of attractions that the <i>butterfly park</i> has to be mentioned???? 

I am proud of my country, but when the STB allows such embarrassing ads to see the (international) light, I want to tell people we're actually a part of China. I wonder why we're always trying so hard to pretend to be some fun, funky, <i>spontaneous</i> Singapore. Whose weird idea of tourist desirability are we trying to conform to? We're strict, we're unapologetically capitalist, we're clean and green, we have fun in our own strictured little way (read: NOT bartop dancing). We're a hodgepotch of cultures, languages, cusines; there are so many things to sell. Of all things, why can't we be cool enough to accept who we are, stare the countries still struggling with inflation, unemployment (hello, Europe), private ownership of firearms (and you too, America)--any number of problems our tidy laws have kept at bay--squarely in the eyes and <b>really</b> celebrate the things unique to us for once?

So for example, you get something like: bluebottle - boat. This reminded me of what someone did using the yellow pages (which has a similar format), and it works for dictionaries too--assigning meanings to the compound words that are randomly formed from taking the first and last words on a page.

Here are some particularly useful ones, because my brain needed exercise first thing in the morning, and mostly because coming up with them amused me greatly:

coconut-cozignance: the burst of mental activity after being hit on the head with a hard object falling from a great height (see also <i>Newton's apple</i>)

money-monolith: (see <i>multi-national corporation</i>)

pecuniary-peg: 1. a money-clip 2. the cut in your allowance after your parents realize your handphone bill can keep a third-world village afloat for a month

redeemer-reference: the quote, especially from a recognized authority in the field, that saves your floundering gp essay from falling irretrivably into the abyss

"event","This song, it's always this song. The great paradox of the Christian faith:

<i>Your grace is sufficient for me
Your strength is made perfect, when I am weak
All that I cling to
I lay at Your feet
Your grace is sufficient for me

(Taken from 2 Corinthians 12:9)</i>

Sometimes I wrestle with the word 'sufficient'. Sometimes 'grace' and what what it encapsulates. Sometimes it's the whole line: all that I cling to, I lay at Your feet. So I did this:

<b>sufficient</b>
[Collins Cobuild] <i>If something is <b>sufficient for</b> a particular purpose,   there is enough of it for the purpose</i>
[Longman] <i>as much as is needed for a particular purpose</i>
[Oxford] <i>sufficing; adequate; enough</i>

<b>grace</b>
[Collins Cobuild] <i>The kindness that God shows to people because he loves them</i>
[Longman] <i>God's kindness that is shown to people</i>
[Oxford] <i> favour of God; divine saving and strengthening influence</i>

The definitions for grace are so paltry. Oxford comes the closest, but it's still sketchy and nebulous and awfully confining. It's like trying to define love. You have to receive it to know it, and practice it to understand it. When I think of grace I think of all the things I don't deserve that have been given me--yes, even the silly As in uni that completely surprised me because I thought I wouldnt make it. I think of answered prayers and people who love me. And wonder--of all the people in the world, many more good-hearted, more talented, more deserving, who try harder or even those more dire, more needy--why me? And the best part? I've only just started on the static part of grace...daily I wake to find more; the dynamic part of grace that sustains me on a daily basis, so much so that I often miss it in action. An ever-running brook that flows and flows and flows if only I learn to drink more, deeper, lean in closer to hear its music. <i>Your grace is sufficient for me</i>."

So I watched Half-Nelson, and the biggest takeaway I had from the movie was the interrupting cow joke, which brought me great joy and which still continues to bring me great joy. Oh dear I just typed 'joy' as 'job'. Great job, great typo. Anyway. I have rapidly gone forth and....uh, spread the joke like an infectious virus, and I'm pleased to report that I've only flubbed it <b>once</b>, which is a pretty good record considering this joke  rests completely upon timing and, uh, generous doses of corniness. The hidden fun part is watching everyone blink in confusion after you deliver the joke, cuz the punchline happens so fast. 

But I digress! I wanted to say: the unfortunate recipient of my flubbed joke was none other than ann, but I plead my case as I had a mouthful of food. Lesson learnt: don't ask interrupting cow jokes when eating. The flubbed joke had a propitious conclusion however, in that ann informed me, very patiently after I had to get her to sit through the joke again because I spoilt it the first time round (I am so uncool), that there was actually a WHOLE SERIES of such knock-knock jokes! I didn't know knock-knock jokes had sub-genres!!! Now this opens up a whole new avenue of inspiration, but so far most of what I've come up with aren't very socially polite, hawhaw. 

If this post completely bewilders you, chiefly because you have no idea what the interrupting cow joke is, ask me when you next see me and I'll regale you with it--allow me to, it would bring me so much joy!"

Most ironically, before I bothered, um, being bothered I was always stubbornly sure I had <b>good grammar</b>, and with such self-possession then, I could actually write normally and not second guess every other sentence I churned out. gaaaargh. 

Today in the office we had coffeebean sandwiches leftover from a seminar and they were very very good. We must randomly order the take-away party sets from coffeebean sometime soon, bestfriends, because they are unbelievably SATISFYING, especially if you're perennially greedy and undecided about what to eat, like I am.

Am aware that the above is a mishmash of completely random thingamijigs, with probably the only commonality being that all of them occurred to me today. I think one needs what i would loosely call a 'blogging-mindset' to maintain a successful webjournal. What do i mean? Like when things happen to you, and you catch yourself thinking, automatically: oh, i must blog about this! Obviously, this doesn't often happen to me, and when I do think: oh, let's go comfort my poor neglected journal, I load this page up in a welter of burning ambition and then proceed to stare at it, on and off, throughout the day, wondering why I can't string two interesting thoughts together. And when I DO finally type the first sentence out I find myself editing it heavily, wondering why my grammar is so <i>cannot make it</i>, while trying to remember if writing was always such a chore in the past. Probably not. Words used to come easily. Now every measured word seems so trite and paltry, what I mean to say disappearing in a mist of softened edges and not-quite-theres, with writing becoming a mechanical motion of chew-spit-chew-spit. I read menstruate's journal entry (who is a friend of a friend and who will probably be extremely alarmed by seeming stalker attention) today and almost had a seizure trying not to laugh in the office, and then I got very sober, wondering why I can't find joy in writing that way anymore."

-get a masters in lingusitics
-get a phd in econs
-get a degree in law
-take the communication design course at NAPFA, or heck, if could get in, at Parson's or St Martin's
-get a degree in an esoteric dead language, like Latin 
-get a degree in creative writing, like at columbia, which sounds so wonderful, sigh

Of course, by the time I achieve all of the above, i would also be 50 years old or something, and very much a wrinkly old prune, not to mention an extremely confused one, given the diverse nature of everything I want to do. Now there's a thought. I would be an extremely wrinkly confused old prune. Hoohoo. This beats the image of me, creaky and old, in a rocking chair howling at the moon, which Jo-ann and I used to talk about, that was to be our retirement plan if no one wanted to marry us. 

Meanwhile, i still owe, um, the general plethora of eager-beaver readers who frequent this livejournal the graphics from WHAT BESTFRIEND AND BESTFRIEND DID LAST WEEKEND, and pictures of my lego-sweet-man, called ANSONR0XX88, so named for no other reason other than the general pleasure I derive from coining nonsensical names that sound like a 15 year old's msn address.

EDIT:
grin. I realized that instead of NAFA, I'd written NAPFA, which was, y'know, the sadistic PE thing we had to all take from primary 4, all through secondary school, and up to JC? Till I spoke to Keith, I didn't realize i'd mixed up sadistic-PE test with the art school hahahahaha."

<big>Tuesday January 9, 2007</big>

<big><b>uxorious</b></big> \uk-SOR-ee-us; ug-ZOR-\, <i>adjective</i>:
Excessively fond of or submissive to a wife. 

Now we can all act smug and superior, instead of saying 'henpecked'. But then come to think of it, henpecked is such a delicious word. <i>Uxorious</i> just sounds like the unfortunate husband has liver troubles. And, why does no one ever say 'praying mantis eaten', or 'guppy oppressed', when referring to repressed husbands? The female praying mantis EATS her husband after he has ceased to be useful to her, and the male guppy has to carry the eggs after the female gives birth, while the she guppy gallavants and goes partying or something. The rooster, on the other hand, doesn't look particularly docile to me, or he wouldn't also be called a cock.

And, I love the definition: excessively fond of or submissive to <b>a</b> wife, like there's a few more wives waiting in the wings that don't quite command the same level of submission or fondness. Why not use THE wife, since we're in this opression-suppression mood? Or ONE'S wife, which would only be unobtrusively logical. 

Ah well. Guess who's in a nitpicking mood today! I huffed my way to work today, the latest i've been yet i think, after I ran out of the house without my wallet, trudged halfway up the hill, then then realized its absence and had to run back to get my brother to throw it down from the window. What with having my wallet defenestrated, sprinting to work and finding slightly pointless word-of-the-days to fill my mornings, I'd say I've had my excitement for the day already, thankyew. Am getting old, now all I wanna do is put my head down and sleep."

Alternative Title: What Bestfriend and Bestfriend Did Last Saturday

Cance has already provided a teaser, but mine will have <i>graphics</i>, i say inventively.

Oh and in other news (since yinyin is slothful with her posts), yinyin's back! The kitties, ann, and I are delighted, all for various reasons, some merely logistical (like: I CAN EAT MY DINNER BEFORE 9PM ON WEEKDAYS AGAIN!!!!), some not. 

And oh, I'm really turning into a prepubescent teenage girl. It's second puberty all over again, like some dratted leftover hormonal surge I left unexpended (why, oh why?? What was I <i>saving</i> it for???) when I was 17. My one saving grace? I refuse to let my fashion sense slide back to my pre-pubescent era, notwithstanding the stubborn urge to pair hot pink and red, and sudden convictions to run around in bum clothing and buy big shapeless sack dresses. Other than that, all other claims to sanity I think I've irretrievably thrown out the window. Proof of this? I've started to think 17 year old ah-bengs are <i>kinda cuuuuute</i>. There! I've gone and said it! *yelps* 

It did just occur to me, that this is probably not the most ideal platform for, um, catharsis. I should start having a nom de plume like oxox_fairy_ger on a separate blog with lots of badly photoshopped pictures of taiwanese boybands and cryptic statements like: ""My love waits in the shadows, My pain will always be stabbing little spikes when I see your face"" scrolling in the margins. 

Okay. Grin.

That was just bad. And mildly funny, in a ""I can't believe I said that"" way. See I told you I've gone bonkers. It must be all this festive eating, and then the sedentary way I'm sitting in the office watching each day slide away so thoughtlessly, like slides in a badly prepared slideshow. Hey look! *click* one day gone. *click click* more days gone. More forgettable slides no-one would have missed. *click* *click* *click* Aye. It must be the turn of the year doing this to me. When the earth ends one cycle and starts another surely something, tangible, must change?"

"event","Am back from Korea, in what was possibly the most mishap-ed trip of my LIFE. First. My baggage got delayed by almost 24 hours. Uh huh, SIA, way to go!! *wiggles the irony-dipped pompoms* Second, it was 2-3 degrees out. Where was my warm clothing??? IN THE LUGGAGE. What did I have in my precious hand-carried bag, instead of a set of extra clothing? THIS LAPTOP. For which I FORGOT my secure-pass so i couldnt log on to office email so basically what I did was hand-carry with me a very heavy mp3 player. yeh. 

So because my warm clothing hadnt arrived I caught a chill, which meant being sick in Korea, with an average temp of 0-5 deg outside. Being cloistered in an ornate hotel room 24 hours a day, delirious with the flu is no fun, you kinda lose track of whether it's night or day, the air-con will never be the right temperature so you're either sweltering or shivering, and I think I now know how it feels to be a druggie, where you're never quite sure what's real or some elaborately accurate dream, and you can wake finding yourself in some part of the room without quite knowing how you got there or how much time has passed since you've been there. Um. yes. not quite the most glamourous thing, and definitely not quite the way I envisioned myself passing my time in Korea.

But! Annoyance with self and circumstances aside, I mustn't forget to record the miracle. In my desperation at being sick and with none of the familiar contrivances and home remedies to turn to (the hotel brought me an ADAPTER, after I called for A DOCTOR, despite me making sure I articulated what I wanted into the phone several times so they wouldnt get it wrong! O tragic hilarity), I thought: okay this is it, this is a classic textbook case of <i>being at one's wits end</i>. Funny how it's only when I've exhausted all my human capacity to help myself that I turn to the answer that was there all the time. A bit of the wrong way around to do things, but I remember thinking, in my half-dead, shivering, great unwashed state (remember no clean clothes cuz no baggage), dear God I feel awful and I don't know what to do, please, please help. I have four more days in this horrid cold place, and I already feel like dying. Please make me better. And PLEASE, make my luggage arrive before midnight so I can bathe. And then after that prayer of desperation I kinda expired, in this half-dead comatose state curled up in a corner of the bed. 

I was woken by the phone ringing, and the awful thought lodged itself in my head that the airline was calling to tell me they had lost my baggage for-EVER. Yes, my mind is naturally positive that way. The chirpy voice at the other end informs me my baggage has arrived at the hotel and will be sent up immediately. Blearily I register the phone clock's flashing display--it's 10.39pm. One prayer answered. yay! 

So my luggage arrives, and with it the prospect of clean clothing and better smelling uh, armpits. Do I rush to bathe? No. I fall right back to sleeping, suddenly daunted by the prospect of struggling out of my clothes because it sounds like too much effort and it's also FRIGGIN COLD. My head was also pounding with the kind of headache one gets from being too cold. Well to end the story of unwashed woe, and to placate my horrified fans, eventually I do get up (I think it was at 1plus am), coordinate one limb at a time, get myself to the bathroom, and BATHE. Yes, it was that bad, I've never been so floored by having to move myself over such a short distance before (ha ha catch the bad-flailingly-awful pun?). 

But the true miracle was when I woke up the next morning, surprisingly spiffy for someone who had been going through the worst throes of a bad flu less than 8 hours before. I've never recovered this fast from the flu before. I actually checked for a sorethroat, tested my creaky voice, stood up and sat down several times in some elaborate ritual to find something wrong with me. Even more amazing was the fact that I had taken no medicine, and had had none of my mom's potent home remedies. Factor in a completely unfamiliar environment (which usually means you take longer to get well), and you'd be able to better appreciate the extent of the miracle. I was up and running by the third morning, and life resumed so I could actually get some decent shopping done by the fourth day! (Always a good measure of normalcy, the ability to shop is). So yes. How could I forget the miracle? Battered down by everyday cynicism, it's easy to come back home and attribute it to 'luck', 'strong immunity', 'an overblown sense of the initial severity of the flu'. But held up to the light and no matter which way I turn it, I can't run from the quiet assurance inside that knows my desperate prayer was heard, and more saliently, answered. Oh it's so easy to ignore the small stitches of His handiwork, because they're usually crafted to be quiet, gentle, unassuming, even (humanly) forgettable. But I think learning to recognize the quiet, non-dramatic things is the hardest, and also the most rewarding part.

"event","Re-reading Tolkien for the nth time, and still discovering new things that thrill me, old things that continue to thrill me, and new ways to love LOTR all over again. Not quite sure why, but I think different parts of the story speak to me at different times. Sometimes it's human heroism I want, sometimes it's the reminder of fragility. And then sometimes I want the slow bits, where I sympathize with every hard-won struggle, recognizing that the progress of a centimetre at a time is still victory worth celebrating. In all, mass appeal of the movie notwithstanding, I really really like LOTR. 

This particular song of Tolkien moves me strangely, the song of the Ents and Entwives. I read it out loud in my room and I love the rhythm of it and the slightly wistful descriptions of the changes in nature, as well as the fact that it's sort of a mating song, with the Ents recalling their missing Entwives. 

ENT:
When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough;
When light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow;
When stride is long, and breath is deep, and keen the mountain-air,
Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is fair!

ENTWIFE:
When Spring is come to garth and field, and corn is in the blade;
When blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid;
When shower and Sun upon the Earth with fragrance fill the air,
I'll linger here, and will not come, because my land is fair.

ENT:
When Summer lies upon the world, and in a noon of gold
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees unfold;
When woodland halls are green and cool, and wind is in the West,
Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best!

ENTWIFE:
When Summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry brown;
When straw is gold, and ear is white, and harvest comes to town;
When honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West,
I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best!

ENT:
When Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay;
When trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day;
When wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain
I'll look for thee, and call to thee; I'll come to thee again!

ENTWIFE:
When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last;
When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past;
I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:
Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!

BOTH:
Together we will take the road that leads into the West,
And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest."

<b>For an Unborn Baby</b>

If she's a girl,
I hope she'll stretch her wings
and grow up free, wide ranging
like a seagull, dealing with the winds
competently, swifting of currents of air,
able to live on anything she can find
in the murky sea, or even in rubbish heaps,
adapting with ease when storms drive her inland.
May she choose wisely if in the end
she settles on one name, one piece of ground.

May she banish those who'd seek to protect her
from heartbreak, or joy.
- And may he achieve no less
if he's a boy.

Was very properly horrified when I re-read it today and found a thousand edits, thoughts clumsily expressed, etc. Gnnnnnngh~! *buries head in sand* Next time I'll let a poem sit for a day or two before I attempt to show it off. Same goes for lots of things in life, I think, like jelly, newly toilet-trained puppies, and uh, dental surgery.

Struggling a little with the pronouns here...But oh well. Was inspired by random throwaway a colleague made this morning about insurance."

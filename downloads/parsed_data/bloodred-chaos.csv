"event","why is it that I'm SO&nbsp;incredibly hormonal or horny or whatever that ALL&nbsp;I&nbsp;CAN&nbsp;THINK&nbsp;ABOUT&nbsp;IS&nbsp;WHO&nbsp;I&nbsp;CAN&nbsp;FIND&nbsp;TO&nbsp;HOOK&nbsp;UP&nbsp;WITH??? sexual frustration has got to be one of the worst feelings ever -___-&nbsp; and then getting rejected at every turn by random ppl just cus, for some reason, I've made myself incredibly DESPERATE?&nbsp;wow. 

&quot;all I&nbsp;want is someone to want me&quot;&nbsp;right?&nbsp;well. I've been told that men are turned off by women who are so incredibly open about such things as being horny and such.&nbsp; okay then, should I&nbsp;bring out the plaid miniskirt and spandex, pink polo and whatnot, and gossip about people all day, using excessive amounts of &quot;likes&quot;? Should I&nbsp;become the ultra girly girl that I've always semi-despised as simply an image of what men want?&nbsp;I&nbsp;think not. 

So WHY&nbsp;THE&nbsp;FUCK&nbsp;CAN'T&nbsp;I&nbsp;JUST&nbsp;WAIT&nbsp;TILL&nbsp;COLLEGE&nbsp;THEN? I&nbsp;know I'll find plenty of people to hook up with in college, maybe even fall in love.&nbsp; So why do I so desperately NEED&nbsp;someone now?&nbsp;I&nbsp;suppose because I&nbsp;live in the now, and &quot;you'll get it eventually&quot;&nbsp;just doesn't cut it for my mind.&nbsp; &quot;instant gratification&quot;&nbsp;is a phrase that makes me feel guilty, but I&nbsp;suppose it aptly describes my tendencies.&nbsp; well shit. &nbsp;

So if all I&nbsp;can think about is this all day, surely there's gotta be some guy thinking the same right?&nbsp;that's what my mind keeps telling me, thus I&nbsp;continue to put myself down just because no one will screw me.&nbsp; Even my ex bf, he must have felt too &quot;pressured&quot;&nbsp;and nervous to have sex.&nbsp; I&nbsp;obviously underestimated teenage boys.&nbsp; What really bothers me though is that I&nbsp;thought every teenage boy wants to have sex right?&nbsp;but I&nbsp;guess it's the whole sexist image of wanting a shy, sweet, innocent girl.&nbsp; I&nbsp;suppose the fact that I&nbsp;actually WANT&nbsp;to fuck is a &quot;huge turnoff&quot;&nbsp;to them, as one friend has told me.&nbsp; Uhm okay, so if they don't like girls who WANT to does that mean they want to rape them?&nbsp;I&nbsp;know they don't. But still.

I'm just frustrated because I KNOW&nbsp;I'm cute, I&nbsp;have a decent personality, etc.&nbsp; all I&nbsp;have to do is STOP&nbsp;BEING&nbsp;SO&nbsp;OBSESSED&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;THIS. 

if anyone actually read this, help is DESPERATELY&nbsp;needed and greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Any suggestions -sigh-"

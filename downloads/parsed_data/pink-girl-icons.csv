"event","Welcome to Pink Girl Icons... this will be my icon name. My regular name is <lj user=""lacheyluver""> but please don't request stuff in my personal journal or just friend me just because you think I'll make you an icon just because you did so. If you want icons made for you all you have to do is just reply to the request posts that I will do from time to time in here and sometime there will be freebies for you to take but you <b>MUST</b> credit <lj user=""pink_girl_icons""> if you do take my icons because I do work hard on them. Well this is all for this intro post so I hope you have an enjoyable experiance at Pink Girl Icons!

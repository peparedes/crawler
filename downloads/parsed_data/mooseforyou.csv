"event","While talking with a friend, I realized that I hate 85% of this journal. The majority of these entries are incredibly depressing and I do not enjoy seeing them and reflecting on the person I used to be. I don't know how you guys view me.. but I have completely changed. I feel it is time to move on to a new journal, for a clean slate with God in my life.

"event","I know what my life is lacking. 

<font size=""4"">An undeniable and genuine relationship with God. </font>

I am honestly trying and making a distinct effort to encorporate Him in every decision and aspect of my life. It takes a lot of strength, and I know God will help me.  He wants me to accept Him into my life. And I have known for awhile that I need to be a lot more active in my relationship with Him, and there really is no adequate reason to excuse me for being distant. At least I am realizing and eager to accept Him now. I plan on this to be a permanent improvement in my life. No longer will it be temporary.. I am done with letting my faith slip my mind. It should be one of or the most important aspect in my life, and I want it to be. I really do."

"event","I just got grounded. And I really could not care at all. At least at the moment. Jon and Marc were talking about religion and I was just completely awstruck the entire time. And I definitely had an awakening with my life.. and the world as a whole. God put those two amazing individuals on this earth. Such beautiful people...I was sitting there at Spudnuts.. and I just felt so honored and thankful to be sitting there hearing their perspectives and beliefs. The fact that I was given the opportunity to converse and hear their words.. it makes me feel like a new person. I cannot even bring this to words how I feel right now. 

Ah, I will finish this tomorrow.. my parents are incredibly angry with me right now. I wish they could understand me. It is highly depressing that when you try to tell your mom you just had the most amazing experience and realization and she wont even forget that its 4 in the morning and just sit and listen to me in complete amazement and happiness. Yes I am SO happy right now. God Is Amazing. I feel so alive right now. This is how I felt when I went on that mission trip. 

I am sorry Mom and Dad that I cannot obey your boundaries on my curfew. But I need to make these decisions on my own. If I feel like my night is not fufilled. I am not going to go home. I like ending the day with a sense of fufillment and adequacy. Goodnight. I love you so much. 

Thank you Jon and Marc for giving me this feeling. You have no idea. This is why I need to be a follower of God and Jesus Christ. The things He has done for me despite the rough things that have happened in my life..and despite breaking my curfew. I could care less about the time on my clock. I could care less about my berates on lonliness. All that matter is that I, Stacey Nicole Martin am alive."

"event","Well.. i don't know. I am not even sure what to say. Except I am probably going to take a leave of absence from my ""social life"" if that's what you would call it. Not like I am really expecting anyone to miss me except for a small few. I am not mad at anyone.. I am just frustrated and lonely.. which probably isn't exactly the best way to cope with that.. by NOT GOING OUT at all...oh well. Lets see how it works. 

I have just unfortunatly become so seperated from my family.. i might want to try and rekindle a relationship with my family. And let them really and genuinely know that I care about them more than they ever could know. 

I'll probably end up at a random park everyday this week. Taking photos. Walking and enjoying the beautiful nature that is sometimes hard to find around here. And then I will come home and talk with my mom and dad.. and even my brother and catch them up on my pathetic excuse for a life. And hopefully repair the cycle of dissociation. 

But being disconnected with my family is not the only thing that is getting to me lately. I have dipped into it more than a few times on here. Hmm.. lonliness. Yep. I hate even talking about it. Because just talking about it makes me look like a weak individual who can't deal with the fact they they are completely and utterly alone. And when I say ""alone"" I am referring to my wretched love life. Which is very much nonexistent. Love is not even the appropriate word choice. Just thinking about it makes me want to go into social isolation. Which is also a bit ironic. 

Who ever thought that Me, Stacey, once characterized by my friends as the ""strong"" one who had it all figured out, would be writing/complaining about how lonely she is. I just honestly need to learn to love being independent. If that is even possible. Not that I <i>want</i> to be dependent on anyone.. That is not what I meant. I just.. blah.. I really don't even know anymore. 

I am sick of making pointless efforts. I am sick of getting my hopes up. I am sick of being optimistic when I probably shouldn't be. I am sick of getting involved with people when it will just fall into shambles within 2 weeks. I never want to be used by a guy EVER again. I am sick of waiting around. I am sick of CARING ABOUT THIS CRAP IN GENERAL. But the truth is.. I don't know how to <i>not</i> care about it. 

I really need to stop focusing on trying to attain happiness from a nonexistent force in my life. It may never happen in my life..and I just need to deal with it. And find happiness in other areas. Which I can do. But the problem will be learning how to fufill the emptiness that I feel everyday when I wake up.. and everynight when I go to bed. 

So there. No livejournal. No enclave. For as long as it takes for me to realize what needs to be done in my life. Everyone take care.. and enjoy your happy lives full of love."

"event","I am making this public for some strange reason. Have fun with this one Arny. 

It's nice when your parents think you're an embaressment. When they think that you're the most irresponsible waste of life. As we are speaking..""You were doing so good.. what the fuck happened."" Thanks Mom. Telling me how worthless and embaressing I am is really going to boost my confidence. Whatever. I can blame it on being an artist. Missing all my classes today was an accident. Yes, probably irresponible on my part...well aside from the flat tire. But besides missing my classes.. I feel like I grew as an individual a bit today. I feel so distant from my family. Each and every day I feel like I am growing farther and farther apart from them. Yes, it is slightly depressing.. but when I have a horrible time relating to ANYTHING with them.. and I disagree almost 95% of the time with them.. I cannot force myself to stand there and take it. I know I need to put more focus on school. And I have a problem with following my sporadic urges when it comes time for class. I guess I just need to have a one track mind when it comes to class. It is a bit of problem with hanging out with older people I do admit. They are a lot more tempted to forget about class and get away with it. I am still young, still in high school for god's sakes. If I was at mentor there would be no way in hell I would be able to miss classes to spend the day going out to lunch and seeing the results of a photoshoot sitting in a coffee shop meeting an aspriring musical artist. Yeah.. no way. I still enjoyed today. Until I got home. Whatever. I need to leave for work. My parents have no idea how they make me feel and I am sick of reiterating the point to them that they make me feel like I shouldn't want to be a part of the family."

"event","Hmm.. came home sick today.. threw up.. and slept for eight hours. AWESOME. Now I have been watching The Real World and Laguna Beach and at the commercials.. election coverage. My what a pathetic <s>evening</s> day it has been. Atleast I got ALL my art projects done last night.. and turned in. 

I decided to sit in the other room away from my parents while they watched election coverage. I don't completely despise bush.. but I am not pro Kerry. I am not really too sure who I would like to be in office. They both make me cringe at the sight of either of them in office. I really did not want to be around my parents biased views and commentary though. And they wouldn't let me go out for the second night in a row.

 What the hell is that about? No longer is it about having my homework done before I go out.. it's about developing an appreciation of living in my own house? Sorry mom and dad, I am not going to force myself to appreciate something.. especially something that makes me upset the majority of the time. I need to realize it and learn it on my own.. and by giving me more and more reasons to despise being at home.. isn't exactly the way to get me to appreciate it. I really do not understand their parenting skills sometimes. 

But hey, I still love em'. SO if my dear half-brother reads this.. and so conveniently rewords it with severe exaggeration and it makes it back to my dad.. like it usually does.. I am not saying i dislike or do not love mom or dad. They are great people..but like you once told me.. I need to realize that my parents aren't always right about everything."

"event","Sorry about that entry from two in the morning. I cannot even bring myself to read it anymore. It is so depressing. Who knew such pathetic and desperate thoughts would leave my fingertips. Luckily only the people on my friends list were able to read that. I would proabably feel a slight sense of embaressment if everyone was able to read that absurd piece of writing. I guess that is just how my brain operates at two in the morning. Although it felt like three in the morning because of the time change. Oh, and if you are not a livejournal user, and not on my friends list.. ignore the above paragraph.. because it really wont make any sense at all. If you care that much.. create a livejournal account.. and let me know who you are.. and I will add you to my friends list. 

So today I got to work 15 minutes late.. but I was able to leave an hour early. Hah. I was insanely bored at work.. I ended up voluntarily cleaning all the tiles and scrubbing the walls. Took me a good 2 hours of doing that. I was enjoying it though. Maybe I will be a good housewife someday. I was also drawing Halloween related pictures all over the schedule. Well, they were all halloween related except for the giant teddy bear. I passed Paskan on my drive home from work. He looked like he thought he was all slick with his Aviator's on. 

So today is Halloween. It really does not feel like it at all. I am probably just heading up to the enclave tonight. I'll slap on some black eyeliner.. put on my cat ears.. and be a cat. Wow.. I am so original. Maybe I'll put my tail on. Although, I had bad experiences with that last year. Especially while going to the ladies room. I forgot about the tail and I dunked it in the toilet. So disgusting. Did I just call it the ladies room? Wow.. I have never labeled it in my entire life. Pisser, crapper, lavatory, restroom, bathroom, ladies room; same thing. 

Well, I best get going and finish my homework, and do some work with the computer. Hope everyone has a splendid Halloween.. and be careful! Take Care!!"

"event","I am getting really impatient. I just want to buy my new computer NOW! But of course my parents want to be gazing over my shoulder while I input their credit card number on the internet.. because they don't trust me or the internet. They went to go shopping somewhere.. atleast they are bringing home chinese. I always get really excited when I buy something on the internet. Then I get a package with my name on it a few days later! So exciting. Oh, I am buying a Dell Dimension 4600.. with 512MB of ram, 2.80gHz, 80 gig,  16x DVD-ROM & 48x CD-RW Drive, and a 17"" flat panel monitor. Yay. New computers make me happy. I am paying for 2/3 of it. $546 to be exact. The rest is going towards part of my christmas present from my parents. Ha.. I remember when anything over 200 dollars used to seem like SUCH a huge amount of money.. but that's like half of one of my paychecks... that i get every two weeks. I like having a job. I like knowing I can pay for my own stuff. 

A lot of my friends seem really down lately. Which is weird.. because I am usually the one who is down. And I am in a really excellent mood right now. I actually WANT to clean my room and I WANT to work on my art project. I just hate using that stupid exacto knife. My blade is dull.. and I don't have any cash to dash out and buy a new blade. My graphic design class isn't <i>that</i> bad.. I just get behind in all the tedious work.. because I am too busy being on my computer or at the enclave. Atleast I am able to pin point why I don't get homework done. 

<b>List of things to do tonight:</b>
 Clean room
 Visual Org. project (x2)
 English Paper (i still don't have a topic)
 Buy Computer
 Eat Chinese
 Enclave (i doubt will be an option tonight)

Oh and what's some music I can download.. I feel like getting into some new music..."

"event","I woke up this morning feeling the wrath of pizza. Yes, pizza. Last night Curtis and I got a large pizza and ate the entire thing just the two of us. And Eric was there watching us and bitching about his horrific childhood experiences with cheese... ;) . Last night was definitely one of the coldest nights so far. The colder it gets.. the sooner till I learn to snowboard. :) Yay! Yeah.. enclave last night.. but there was no steak and shake.. because we were kicked out.. Eric claims he's taking care of that though. I hope he does. Well after pizza hut.. we headed back to the enclave.. hung around there for a little longer.. then Brad contacted me about Denny's. I decided to go... Eric and Jamie came along as well. We were probably only there for 45 minutes? Yeah last night wasn't that bad.. except.. I AM HAVING REALLY FUCKED UP DREAMS. I mean.. I like the dreams.. but I shouldn't be having them.. because they are creul.. because when I wake up.. it's all gone.. Nevermind.

Soulseek is the most amazing file sharing software ever. You can basically down load music in bulk. No ads, no spyware. Just music. It's really awesome. 

Well.. I feel like making myself a hearty breakfast. And I don't mean cereal and orange juice.. an omelet with perfectly toasted toast, and orange juice. Yum.  

Catch ya on the flip side kids.."

"event","I kinda miss when I used to have really long hair.. Sure it was a huggge hassle.. but I was complimented on it atleast 5 times a day.. I could put my hair back with ease to conceal the fact that I hadn't showered for days at a time. When I styled it wavy I could leave it like that for days.. and not even need to wash it. When I left it straight, it would take atleast 45 minutes to straighten.. that really sucked. But look how pretty it once was..

<center><img src=""http://plasticbox.us/photos/oldhair.jpg"" border=""1""></center>

<center>but those were the days when I spent an hour and a half getting ready.. 
i actually wore lip gloss.. 
i wore wayyy too much eyeliner.. 
i was even more self-conscious than I am now..
oh man have i changed...</center>

Althougth.. short hair is fun & easy. And it doesn't take a freakin' liter of hair dye when I dye my hair.. So which is better...

YOU DECIDE!

"event","So I've decided that OSU and OU are my two colleges of choice. 
BUT.. I need to build up my portolfio like mad in order
to get into VCT (visual communication technology).
So this means.. probably one more year at lakeland.
WHO ISN'T GOING OFF TO COLLEGE NEXT FALL?
We will be best friends. :) 

But it makes sense that I don't go off to a 4 year college just yet.
Build up portfolio.. Make money.. 
Oh and since my mom works at lakeland..
I basically get another free year of college.
I just really hope all my new buddies wont be gone next year. 
:( Hmm..

Well.. I need to work on crap for my Visual Org class.
Oh, and I think I got someone to switch with for Thursday..
So this means.. blood brothers, Against Me! WOOOOOOOOO"

"event","well. 
worked 4-close. 
i was definitely in a working mood tonight.. and an OCD mood as well. I was wiping EVERYTHING down in the store.. and I covered pretty much everything metal with saran wrap. It made work go by ten times faster. It rocked. Then after work I just took it upon myself.. regardless of NO ONE picking up their phones.. and I just drove to steak and shake. Turned out the gang was actually there, but an absence of Eric. Found out he had another bad night; ouch. I hate seeing people so melancholy.. It hurts me.. especially when there is not one damn thing I could possibly do to help them. And I didn't even attempt to; oh well. Feel better buddy. 

Steak and Shake was real breif..I was only there for about twenty minutes. Then sandi, pete, jamie, & tang all left, and myself as well. Yeah.. my car was getting blown about by the wind on the freeway. I wish it would just snow already.. I wanna go sledding, and have a snowball fight.. and LEARN TO SNOWBOARD. <b>Larissa.. you promised this year is the year. </b> I love you. I am calling you tomorrow.. because I haven't talked to your whoreness in a while. 

Oh, and also at work.. I decided to turn mcdonald's into my own personal photoshoot. Well, orginally I was going to take photos of all the disgusting attributes about mcdonalds and turn it into some project.. but I ended up just being a dork and taking photos of random stuff.

oh, and i just realized.. that everything that has happened in my life up until lakeland.. it really doesn't even matter. give or take a few memories. i want to forget about the majority of people i hung around with.. also give or take a few people. there are just some people that have screwed me up or over. of course what they did to me.. just made me an even stronger person. the person that i am actually very happy to be. i just need to not reflect on my past.. and how i let people walk all over me for far too long. 

i feel disgusted now..

what a big load of crap.. that and valentine's day..why do we need two days out of the year to appreciate our significant others? shouldn't you be doing that <i>every</i> day.. anyway?

"event","I decided that I am actually going to take care of myself from now on. What will this entail? Well.. 

<b>#1 Quitting smoking.</b> It is a disgusting, pointless habit. I don't even know why I started.. boredom maybe? I actually have made an attempt by the way kids. 
<b>#2 Sleeping. </b>Okay, lets face it; I need sleep.. we all know this. Maybe I wouldn't be an irritable bitch sometimes if I actually got more than 4 hours of sleep each night. And I could work on those bags under my eyes. 
<b>#3 Keeping my wallet closed.</b> I spend my money.. way too much and way too fast. I definitely need to work on my spending habits. 
<b>#4 Boys don't matter.</b> Why do I always get caught up on..""oh man... why am i always single?""..""how come i can't find someone special?"" Who cares if no one likes me. Doesn't mean I can't have a good time. I really don't need to be worrying about that stuff. I am still young. I feel almost timid about writing this though.. because all this hasn't exactly registered in my head yet. 
<b>#5 EXERCISE. </b>I don't even remember the last time I woke up early to go for a morning jog. I would feel more confident and happy with myself if I took care of some problem areas too on my body. *cough cough* so yeah.. i actually am a girl. i do have boobs.. they are there.. i just seem to conceal them a lot lately... I think my phase of.. ""i really dont care what i look like,"" is slowly fading... because today I was laying on the couch like a lazybum and I am sitting there thinking about the last time I felt sexy. And it has definitely been awhile. Haha. It isn't really about looking good for other people.. just knowing for myself that I look good. Holy crap its been awhile since I felt that way. 
<b>#6 Getting projects/homework done; on time might i add. </b>The last week alone has been incredibly stressful.. and what do I do when I get completely stressed out? well I usually get sick, my face breaks out, and I get really anti-social, and just look and feel like crap in general, oh yeah.. and i dont sleep. Yeah.. I definitely need to work on all those things. 
<b>#7 Religion.</b> Does anyone remember how happy and spirited I was when I came home from that church mission trip? I have NO IDEA why I neglected having any relationship with god the past couple of months. Well I missed the meeting for the upcoming mission trip at my church last week.. and it hit me that I need to get active in my religion.. because I have always been the happiest in my life when religion was a big part of my life. I hate that I go through phases though.. I finally am working later this sunday.. so I can attend church. :) yay.. I am excited. 

I am trying to think if there is anything else that I want to improve in my life. Well.. atleast the major things. I am honestly trying to reach an understanding with my parents.. and talk to them more. I love them.. I truly do.. and I hate that we fight. I just hate that I am always being judged by them..  

oh.. and i am sure most of you know.. but if there is anyone else i haven't told.. I got hired at circuit city. :) Bye Bye Mickey D's!

and i don't know why i am making this entry public. but here goes."

"event","We all are more than well aware of the broad and open ended term, procrastination. We all know it is not the healithiest act, but we all do it anyway. But why? Well.. I think we are afraid we are going to miss something... so we put off some of the most important things. Or atleast the things that are supposed to be important. Importance is not the issue though.. because honestly.. if it was <i>that</i> imporant to us.. why would we put it off? It is all a matter of priorities. I know damn well that my priorities have never been how they should be. The things that matter less in my life.. I tackle sooner.. and the things I should be worrying about.. I set aside until I feel it NEEDS to be done and I have no more time to put it off anymore. 

I hate that I live this way. The more and more I procrastinate the more I notice how stressful, and unorganized my life is. When I do actually get whatever it is done.. it is never even close to my best work. It may not be bad work.. but it is definitely not to my full potential. I really wish I could live each day to its full potential. But instead I waste my time. Maybe this little pep talk of mine will give me the ambition to actually get things in order, because when it comes down to it. When I do actually get things done before they need to be done.. I feel so much better about myself.. and I feel like there is so much time left in the day. I wouldn't be up till three or four am every single night complaining that I am not tired.. when I know damn well that I am exhausted..but I would rather fool my brain into thinking that I have the whole night to get things done. Even though I know I most likely will not complete whatever it is I need to get done. If I would just train myself to accept reality and just DO things. 

I am actually insanely procrastinating as we speak.. which is exactly what triggered this entry. I have another art project to work on. We need between 30 and 40 thumbnail sketches of an object. And I was going to work on it when I got home. Turns out... my object.. which is the family camcorder.. its missing. My parents took it to new york with them. So since I conveniently forgot to tell them I needed it.. I am screwed. And I need to start all over. And I blame myself for this one. 

So this is only ONE example of many. I despise procrastination.. BUT i do it anyway. I cannot live like this anymore. If I would have just did the sketches over the weekend.. I would have remembered to tell my parents that I needed the camera. But i failed to do all of these things. This is just another lesson.. and I need to deal with it. And maybe for once ACTUALLY learn from my mistakes."

I need my parents to think Eric is Mr.Wonderful so then they can let me stay out late.. knowing I am in good hands. I wish they would just trust my judgement.. ha.. I just thought about what I just said. Now let's think about my friends of the past. Ehhhhhhhhh.. well.. my judgement has gotten a lot better! I hope.. 

Brr.. it is really cold! It feels like it should be snowing. I was laying on my car after work staring at the stars. Beautiful sky tonight. Made me smile too. My choppy sentences rock. 

I just realized how much homework I have to complete tomorrow after work. I have good ambition to get it done though. :) Eric visited me again at work. Shannon wanted to go to dunkin' donuts after i got out of work.. but she forgot that we didnt close till midnight. So she had to bail.. and I ended up meeting eric at dunkin' donuts. I think we need a new late night spot. The people who work there are so fucking creepy. We got free munchkins though. 

Well.. I am completely wide awake right now.. so I am going to watch mallrats... AND then wake up at an ungodly hour to go to work... which i plan on being late by the way. Yeah.. goodnight! ;)"

"event","Well.. brad and i were discussing how we both are very analytical people.. we really cannot help it.. it just sorta happens. I guess we just tend to always analyze our surroundings. I wish I could find some sort of explanation for this. All I can think of is that I am highly selective of what I do with my time and who I spend it with.. BUT that does not make much sense. Maybe it might relate to my obsession with details and how I fucking love them. I just find so many things entirely too interesting. I really cannot decide whether this is a bad thing or not. I mean, it could be.. if I over analyze something.. this will lead to paranoia.. thus making me completely fucking stresed out. That is never a picnic in my book, or anyones book for that matter. But if there was no stres.. wouldn't life just be a complete bore? I think it would..

I think partly the reason i over analyze situations because I am fearful of losing something. I mean it could be anything, a person, a friend, an idea, my surroundings... etc. I just have a terrible time with accepting things as they are. For instance.. a friend stops talking to me.. My brain then goes into attack mode and I need to know every fucking possible reason and truth behind why this friend decides to ""de-friend"" me. 

But putting analysis on a different level is actually more entertaining to me. Being able to understand a person for more than just their basic characterists. Knowing all the unspoken traits about a person.. the way they carry themselves in a room, how they bite their nails, how the look at you, where their eyes are in a room. Just having the ability to know and perceive exactly what someone else is going through or seeing is completely inconceivable. It's physically impossible. And that is partly i think the reason why I love to analyze. Just for the sake of maybe understanding another persons perspective as much as I can to my ability. People are amazing creatures and i like stating the obvious, people are different, every single one of us. There's so much to know and learn about a person.. and when I get interested in a person.. I want to be able to connect with them and find out as much as I can.. just for the sakeof understanding them.. and trying my best to relate to them and feeling the same things as them. 

You may label this as being extremely obsessive over a person. But I don't see it that way. I just always feel the need to understand a person. And it pisses me off when people choose to, ""not want to talk about things."" I do respect that statement.. but damn it pisses me off. I want to hear your anger. I want to feel your pain. I want to be there when you burst out into laughter. I want to know every damn thing that makes you smile. It's just they way I am. It's my fucking way of life."

"event","Alright. So my mind is telling me to update.. but there really isn't much to update about. See.. I was trying to put some thought into what I have done this weekend and I was trying to figure out if anything could correlate to a deeper meaning.. but I failed at that idea and just decided to post one of those, ""hi im still here, but this is what i did the past few days,"" entries. Yeah.. those completely superfluous posts that never really have any distinct purpose at all. The only purpose I can think of is that is satisfies my livejournal needs. Haha. 

Well.. yesteryday.. woke up late for work. After work I raced around, took a shower and went to Shannon's where we tried out our auto mechanic skills for about 20 minutes while we changed the bulb for my license plate light. Ha! Take that you pretentious kirtland hills cop bastards. Yeah.. then my fam and I went out to dinner for my Aunt's birthday. It basically was a mourning session about my grandma, and my aunt looked incredibly depressed and kept rephrasing the same statement, ""now i know what it feels like to be completely alone."" Poor gal. Then we came back to our house and ate some cake.. then Shannon met me at my house and we went over Brad's house and watched some television. .. we were watching SexTalk with Sue Johansen on oxygen.. haha that show rocks..it was an all around good time except I kept dozing off for 45 minutes.. and when i woke up and Shannon was gone and it was like 1:10 or something. SO then I stuck around for another hour.. My incoherency brought me to saying my usual late night jibberish that a few of you may understand. haha. I've noticed that Brad is real hospitable to his guests. I like seeing that in people, especially guys. Yeah.. so then I left around 2 o' clock. My parents were completely asleep.. didn't even notice when i got home two hours past my curfew. I slept on the couch again. I just can't sleep in my room. Its a complete disaster area, and I despise my bed. grr.

In other good news though.. if I clean up my room and maintain completion of my weekly chores.. I will get my grandma's silver honda accord. :) I can't wait! I hate the cutlass with a passion. Oh and sean got a new car.. its real slick. A 2003 black pontiac grand am. He also might come back to mcd's on saturday's and sunday's so he can pay off his car faster. That would be awesome if he came back! I am SUPPOSED to be getting my hair cut & dyed sometime within the next week. 

Life has been real fun lately.. been hanging out with a bunch of new people and I like it, a lot. I love meeting people. :). I am so glad I chose to go to lakeland this year. Whoo. 

well I am actually going to clean my room.. and FINISH IT this time. I wanna go out for a few hours tonight.. who knows though. Well later on kiddies.."

I was pretty surprised that a boss at a store was talking to a future customer that way..so i didnt say anything.. and he just shoots back, ""i'm serious go on your internet and play around with your camera all you want."" I very badly wanted to unleash my inner-bitch on him.. but for some reason I didn't. It's people like him who dont realize why they don't make as much money as they probably could.. because I <i>was</i> planning on buying things from that store..but that man doesn't deserve the fucking satisfaction.. so yeah.. i just let out an ..""ummmmm okay."" SO yeah.. epo and i decided to head to the enclave and we tried this real good strawberry papaya drink. And we bullshitted for a good 2 hours. (oh and Epo is this cool dude that I met at lakeland on thursday, his real name is Erik, but everyone calls him epo..works for me..although he does believe that oswald was the single shooter... BUT i wont hold that against him ;] ). He wanted me to meet his good friend Mike.. so he stopped by too. Turns out I've seen him all over lakeland too. So it was 15 till 4 and Epo asks me if i had a dog.. and then all the sudden i realized I forgot about my dog stranded at the groomers. Hah! Lol. yeah so I picked up the little bugger and he devoured a milkbone on my car seat and got it all nasty. Yeah.. then I went to work! Where I wanted to kill myself and got a massive migraine. Well its just about time for bed time.. or in my case, couch time. (oh yeah.. i refuse to sleep on the twin bed.. i cant fall asleep in it for some reason).. who knows.. WELL.. i need something to do tomorrow night.. is anything going on.. call me.. 796-1620 ;)

night kiddies..

oh yeah... and i talked to casey about a half hour ago.. she wasn't exactly sober.. but it was highly entertaining.. :) i miss you caseyy!! i will visit sooon."

<img src=""http://plasticbox.us/photos/sneakpreview.jpg"">

it should be up within the next week.. i have to compile all my photos that I actually want to display. And I am going to start selling my photos.. probably prices ranging .50 to $5.00 depending on what went into the photograph. I will eventually be selling designs, altered photographs, and layouts. Fun Fun! Everyone always told me I should try to make money off this stuff.. So maybe I can! If anyone has ever been interested in purchasing a photograph..<lj-cut text=""this is what it entails.."">

<b><u>purchasing a photograph means:</b></u>
1.)you either would like the rights to use the image as you wish, (but cannot claim it as your own.)the full size image will be e-mailed to you. and you can send check or money order or preferably paypal. I will <u>NOT</u> e-mail any photograph until I have received the proper payments. This is a business people ;)

2.)or you would like your own print-out.. which will be mailed to you.. s&h, and any other printing fees will be additional. and like above.. I will not mail any photograph until I have received the proper payments. Thank You..

this is all coming soon of course..but I just thought I would keep you guys updated.

"event","Hooray for lakeland! Yes, indeed. I love it. Anyway.. I met some cool people today. Seems the more friendlier bunch is introducing themselves more often than I expected. That ""gorgeous"" guy seems actually kind of like a douche. But alas, I don't know him! But yeah.. I was sitting around after classes.. didn't feel like going to my car.. and some guy named rob came over and sat by me and we started talking for a bit. Then his friend Eric joined him.. and starting talking about the enclave and photography.. and right there I joined the conversation. Rob had to leave.. So eric and I were talking straight-up photography and digital cameras and photoshop. Haha. Sounds like my type of person. Turns out he's going up to the enclave tonight to hang up some of his photography.. I thought that was real fucking cool. Yeah.. so sorry I havent had anything of substantial value to talk about besides lakeland and my job. But hey! I'm not doing anything else besides those 2 things. 

Maybe this weekend I will have some more elaborate and less ""boring"" topics to associate with. Considering my social life has drastically increased the past month. Finally I am beginning to hang around with what my parents would label as the ""right crowd."" 

I also was playing phone-tag with shannon all day and finally met up with her after classes and she met Rob as well. I also met a nice girl named Olivia today. Maybe I will start talking to random people too. I really enjoy all of my classes. Sure.. I am a bit nervous about some of them, visual organization for example. The only class I really have a slight problem with is English. BUt as long as I tune out my peers in the classroom I think it wont be a hassle at all. COnsidering my teacher is actually real cool too, I thouroughly enjoyed his, ""pass the fucking salt story."" Ah.. well I need to get something in my stomach before I keel over. Hope everyone has a lovely thursday!"

And. I saw the beautiful guy again.. About three times today. He was staring at me it looked like. :). He sat down and ate his lunch at the table right next to me.. and he was definitely looking over at me. This is very good news. I'll eventually say something to him. Haha. 

Well.. I really don't have much to say. I caught up with Shannon a few times. I kept running into everyone today! I saw Dan Z like 4 times today.. hahah. Apparently he's in Shannon's english class. Yeah.. well I am going to get my algebra homework done before work. Later guys!!!"

"event","Soo.. lakeland = the sequel of mentor high. Literally. My english class... All mentor students.. minus 3 people. Blah! And I swear.. my teacher.. a clone of Mr.Macura.. I almost shat myself.. because i hate that man. Algebra was a a little better.. only about 8 mentor kids. I already knew the teacher through my mom.. my mom is his secretary.. haha i saw him before class started. It was funny. Art Appreciation seems awesome, and ultra-easy. And the teacher is real young, and real cool. Sporting a hawaiian shirt the first day. Haha.. I thought it was sweet. Tomorrow I've got Visual Organization, Algebra again, and Government. Hah.. should be nice.. i hope. I like the classes that have people I don't recognize. I don't know why... I just really want to start over fresh with everything. But unfortunatly lakeland is crawling with mentor students. AH well.. its not like I can change it. Well after lakeland.. Vaune and i decided to go thrifting.. so I scrounged up $2 in dimes and met her up there. I found a sweet t-shirt.. it says, ""braces are beautiful."" haha. It's a great find. Then I found some more change roaming around my car and bought a pretzel from auntie anne's. Then I realized I needed something to drink.. so I visited mcd's and bullshitted with shannon for a few minutes. 

I am still real excited to be out of mentor. I might actually learn something? And today I was walking through breaker's and i saw the most BEAUTIFUL guy. I must meet him. I've never done that before.. when I've been completely drawn to a guy and almost ran into a pole while staring at him. Never happened before! I barely could remove my eyes. Hahaha..

I wasn't feeling too good when I first got there.. but it wore off shortly. Hmm.. who was up there? Casey, Russ, Shannon, Jason, Josh, Ike, Amy, Brad, and some dude. And by 1:30ish it was only me, casey, josh, and ike left. Vuicich texted me.. and he actually came! I knew he would though.. the way i persuaded him at work. hahaha. I didn't get to bed until like 5 or something last night. And I didn't wake up until like 2pm. And that was only because my dad called me. Yeah.. I thought the clock said 2:56 when I woke up.. if it did I would have felt like a real waste. 

My mom just got home from work and started bitching at me. About not mowing the front lawn. I don't get her. WHY the fuck does it matter what time of the day I mow the lawn.. as long as I get it done. She wanted me to wake up at like 9am this morning.. Umm.. i have a day off of work.. why would I ever wake up at 9 on my own free will. But I do seriously need to get back on a somewhat normal sleep schedule.. with classes starting and all in 5 days.. Oh man.. I am sooo excited! I also need to take a look at my text books.. and go through my classes at lakeland.. I don't know where the rooms are at all. Blah..

Once school starts I am still going to be working like 30-35 hours a week. It's kinda funny. As long as I have mondays and fridays off. I am set. I hate working monday's and i hate working fridays. So it all works out. I am so excited. September 3-5 I am goint to columbus to visit Casey in college, and to visit my brother.. and party with him and his wife. :)"

anyway.. last night i fought with my parents about going to denny's.. there is absolutley nothing wrong with going to denny's! It would be a sin, and the ultimate punishment if they ever banned me from going to denny's. I think I would have to get emancipated..I think the gang is going up to denny's again later.. Casey leaves in like two days so we've been going everyday the past 2 days? Yeah.. well I accomplished absolutley NOTHING today.. except maybe when I read Newsweek.. the cover caught my eye about wives who cheat on their husbands, via the internet and work. I think I just spotted the word internet and my messed up dork-radar kicked in. Yeah.. no more elaboration on that.. that just makes me laugh and think of.. ""photoshop?!?!?!"" remember vaune..how could you forget? 

Wow school starts in eight days, Justin's trial is in two days, Casey leaves in two days.. hmm.. anything else that is worth caring about for the future? Remind me if there is.

"event","So.. today I remembered why I despise working mornings. Not only am I usually forced to function on barely any actual sleep. (Alright.. so that was my choice.) But anyway. Dragging your feet into work when you are already late because when  your alarm clock goes off at 7:30am it doesn't actually inspire you to get up. Also noticing a lobby full of customers who all look mildly depressed and pissed off they cannot have their fucking food when their greedy, egocentric minds want it. Not to mention Sheila was on one-window by herself and it was 8:15. As soon as I walked into complete chaos.. Sheila was already all aggravated with the headset.. Nathan was on counter..being the complete moron that he is. If a mentally-retarted turtle could be employed at McDonald's.. that would be the equivalent of Nathan. I passed Matt Morton who was of course by himself in kitchen pending 8 orders.. and was waiting on round & folded egg. As I passed him I realized the perverted-perspiring-touchy-feely-daniel-tomas had not asked me in his disgusting tone of voice, ""how are you my lady?"" Then I realized he wasn't there and I asked Morton where he was.. Apparently the bitch decided to call off because he is on ""medication that gives him the shits."" After calling Tomas a handful of names, and much laughter with morton..I knew it was going to be a wickedly long day. 

And that was just an understatement. I joined Morton in kitchen and hopped on assembly to a lovely 11 pending orders. I made a joke of it the first hour.. and then I just got really fucking angry. Vuicich got there and yelled at me that I needed to go in the hole.. (that never happened though.) Lobby was still full, drive-thru was still wrapped around the building.. and dumbass was still the only one on counter, and poor sheila alone on drive-thru. Oh yeah.. then we got a bus. But going on..Vuicich kicked me out of kitchen.. and I had to help up front. Then we realized that we had absolutley no bacon left in the store. That was fun..Yeah I was making fun of the customers with sheila.. some dude was bitching at sheila because he didn't get his food yet.. his exact quote was (with hand motions included), ""everyone else is being helped.. but no one has helped my space."" Right sir.. I didn't know you owned half the fucking counter. I am sick of customers bitching about how we are understaffed. Maybe if we didn't hire 90% criminals, morons, and druggies.. the store might actually function correctly. That way people wouldn't be getting arrested on the job, quitting because their mental capacity can't handle Mc-fucking-Donald's, or because their too hung over or fucked up to work. %$@%$#&%#^%@^%!@RAAAAAAAAAAA

And lets not forget when that 8 hours is finally over. Or 8 1/2 in my case. You drive home at 4:30 in annoying traffic. FINALLY you get home.. you get bitched at because you were out late the previous evening. And then you get automatic instructions for chores. Why the hell would I want to work again?.. and definitely wouldn't be paid for it. That's why working nights is grand. You leave your house as your parents are getting home.. and then when you get home from work.. they are asleep. You get on a pattern of hardly seeing them at all. Sure its depressing. But whenever i DO see them. there is something for them to bitch about. Yeah morning suck, majorly."

Ha.. but anyway.. it was off to denny's earlier.. but we went to the willoughby one because the mentor one wasn't serving food due to regular maintance..or something like that. Our ex-con waiter really fucking sucked and he had some fetish for cheesecake and added it twice to morton's check and mine..but we didn't order cheesecake. AH well.. it was a good turnout for denny's..although i didn't have as much fun as i was expecting.. ah well.. it happens.

Today after numerous hours of bullshitting at work i headed to kmart to pick up some hair dye.. but after a full fifteen minutes of indecisiveness i called my parents to get their input.. of course it was only bitching from their side about how i change my hair color too much..(but yet its been at least four or five months) and my mom was saying in her motherly nagging pissed off tone, ""if you fuck up your haircolor and i hate it i am NOT paying for your senior pictures."" yeah.. so i figured.. fuck my parents.. its my hair. SO i selected the Clairol nice & easy..""Dark reddish brown."" The color on the box looked fun.. but after i dried my hair i was getting really paranoid about how dark it came out.. But mostly everyone from the denny's crowd said they liked it. I was also infuriated that my sister stole my straightener, <u>AGAIN</u>. So my hair was doing all this i-hate-you-stacey-so-i-will-flip-out-to-piss-you-off. I just looked in the mirror again and realized i do infact like the color.. except my rents haven't seen it yet. SO i am a bit nervous. 

I need to go shopping tomorrow for a few new shirts for senior pictures.. and i need to wash all my clothes try on a bunch and decide what will look nice for senior pictures. And if i am too paranoid.. i'll take pictures and get <b>YOUR</b> opinions. But i need to do all this in the matter of 24 hours.. My photos are scheduled for 3:30pm on August 11th. 

Well yeah.. that was my annual update of my life. Don't get <i>too</i> excited. I need to find some chapstick and get some rest. 

oh and <b>PS</b> vaune and i appear to be on good terms again.. i am glad to hear that but still of course feel bad. It will take some time to heal.. at least definitely for me."

And then I had to hurry home and grab my hooker clothes... then drove to casey's and changed there. I must say we all looked very trampified.. I walked downstairs and Mrs.Hemiovitz goes..""what ARE you wearing stacey?"" Haha. I was upset my digital camera was dead. But yeah.. we headed off and got to Rocky Horror nice and early.. enough time to buy some coffee too. Of course Rocky Horror never fails to amaze me.. and it was a very awesome time. Yeah and then we headed back. We chatted for a bit in Kc's kitchen and then we all headed out around 3:30ish? 

Yeah.. so I am driving home and i have 3 missed calls. One from my parents, one from vaune, and one from kevin. SO i check my messages.. The message from my mom was just telling me to not forget to take my meds.blah blah..motherly stuff. Yeah.. then I didn't check the rest of my messages and decided just to call back. I knew something was up as soon as she answered with a not-so-friendly tone. She had asked me what i did yesterday (thursday) and i was so messed up with my hours i couldn't remember what i did.. and if it was on a thursday. But yeah.. she got straight to the point and asked how my breakfast with matt was.. in a very mocking, angry tone. And then I was called a liar and I just began to completely feel like an ass.. and a creul person. I mean.. i should have told her that I hung out with matt.. right? Well definitely considering our circumstances.. yes i should have. But I knew if I had it wouldn't be so pretty.. but I am sure it would have been prettier than not telling her at all. Unfortunatly I am a moron and a bad friend. Yeah and then there was a ""whatever"" and a hang up from vaune's side. I wasn't surprised.. 

so then I am driving like a maniac on those kirtland roads just completely distraught and mad at myself. Feeling totally bad about the situation.. Then I realized I needed gas badly.. so I figured I'd stop at BP.. well I eventually get down that-a-ways.. and i get a lovely red light. SO i am sitting at the red light and i realize i forgot my wallet at casey's.. so i'm like fuck. BUt yeah.. I wasn't sure what to do at this point.. but I decided to head in the direction of the gas station anyhow.. but I slowly get into the middle of the intersection and my car just stops. I am seriously pissed off and emotionally disturbed at this point and i just burst out sobbing in the middle of the damn road. Let's not forgot my rocky horror makeup was still fully intact (but not for long with the added waterfalls from my eyes). So I decided to call vaune back.. and bear my soul telling her how i am a complete asshole.. i feel like a jerk.. I am a moron.. blah blah blah.. pathetic crap that i dont even want to repeat. Just last night was a very bad bad night. And I felt like dieing.. I felt like I was letting people down left and right. 

I am just completely worried that i fucked up any chance of having a friendship still with vaune. And it fucking sucks.. and its all my fault.. and I feel like there is a big plan plotted against me. But this is paranoia.

BLAH.. i never meant to hurt anyone!! I just still feel like crap and I am completely tired.. so I am going to bed.. who knows if i wake up."

"event","So far this morning I have accomplished getting all of my laundry into the bag, putting on my robe and making some coffee.  Go me.

I have to admit that sitting here with this miniature lap top and my favorite coffee (with half and half and sugar of course!) feels pretty fucking posh.  The new bathrobe I got for Christmas is helping as well.

So the new apartment rocks, but the fabulous home decor has been put on hold due to lack of funds.  I hope that it is more temporary than I think it is right now because I see myself being pretty hard pressed for cash through the middle of February.  Oh well at least I can sit here and feel posh even if I am broke!

I was plagued by bizzare dreams again last night. 

 First I dreamt that both my sisters and I went to college and wanted to dorm together.  The school seemd to be in the middle of no where and though I was indoors I was highly aware of the fact that it was bitter cold outside.  When we got to our room it was jammed with 5 beds and a crib!  Then this bizzare couple comes in with their baby.  My sisters and I were all freaked out and we insisted that one of the parties had to move pronto.  There were moved and for a very short while we were happy, but then, as in real life S started disappearing and avoiding us.

After that I had another dream that I was still away at this barren waste-land of a school but that I was a vampire.  Every night I had to choose a different victim or I would not be able to fake being human during the day.  So I was having a lot of fun picking out the biggest jerks and bitches on campus and picking them off.  Then a cute senator type person came to speak at the school and I decided that he might make a good slave instead of killing these idiots all the time. I was very torn about the descision though because there were still so many dumb folks to choose from."

"event","John got me a keyboard for my Palm for Christmas, it rocks!  Now my little divice can live up to so much more of its potential.  I have no excuse not to start wrtiting again now.  I'll have to start thinking of ideas again.

I've been dreaming of beig on boats lately. First time I was dreaming that I was in the Navy but that I had to be discharged because I had a ""viral syndrome"" that they couldn't figure out.  I physically felt horrible in the dream.  It was a releif to wake up which I cannot say that I have that feeling often.  But when I went back to sleep I dreamt that I was on a ship. Above board, were cruise passengers, below was a hospital.  When I ent in the kitchen, there was blood every where pooled all over the place.  I heard someone coming and I hid.  Two women, nurses, came in (one was Betty White) and they were both covered with blood. I remember focusing on a big glob on Betty's neck.  I knew that they were planning on butchering everyone.  strangely, I wasn't scared, just horribly horribly exhausted.  I don't know how one feels exhausted while already sleeping, but it was weird.  The next night was more boat riding, but more sedate. 

Last night I dreamt that I was traveling through a restored colonial village or something, but the grass and trees were really lush. As I was walking along somene told me that my old landlord had died.  I didn't know how to feel about it in the dream.  It was confusing."

"event","I am so freaking wound up today that I don't know what to do with myself.  It's like I want to stand on my desk and do the rumba.  I wish I could channel the energy into doing my work, but I am just too frenetic to pin myself down.  So weird.  Anyway, I am trying to get a little group together for lunch but everyone else is in slow motion.

I'm taking Indie and Sky to the vet on Saturday for their 1st annual check up.  I have to get another carrier before the appointment because they have outgrown the one that I brought them in last time.  On their first trip to the vet they weighed about 5 lbs each.  Now one is 15.5 lbs (a little bit of a fattie) and the other is 12 lbs (a little bit skinny for a Ragdoll.)

I had a disturbing thing happen with the skinny one that made it hard to leave him and come to work today.  We were laying on my bed yesterday morning having a snuggle when suddenly he stuck out his tongue and started ""coughing.""  It didn't seem like a gaggy hair ball thing, but rather a wheezy thing.  I was alarmed, after a few seconds of waiting for him to work it out, I lifted him up and he was like a rock frozen in pose.  I looked into his eyes and he didn't look afraid, so I blew in his face to see if I could interrupt whatever the problem was.  (My friend's Yorkie used to hyperventilate with excitement when people came over and that worked for him.)  So I blew on him and he seemed to perk up and relax.  I put him down and watched him until he returned to seemingly normal.  I have been a little suspicious as of late because he hasn't been greeting me at the door every time I come home or run right to me when I call his name as usual.

Anyway, I called the vet and told them about it.  They told me if it just happens the once, then coming in on Saturday is fine and it might just be a furball thing.  (I gave him some fur ball medicine 1/2 an hour after it happened.)  But if it happens again, I have to rush him in.  Poor baby!"

"event","One of my least favorite things ever is having to poop while at work.  Men have all kinds of pooping at work etiquette but women don't have any.  If you are in a stall trying to do your thing, it is almost a guarantee that the next woman in the rest room is going to choose the stall right next to yours!  This totally prevents your process and you are forced to just sit there until they are done.  All the while you know that she is looking at your shoes and can tell its you even if you are one of those types that have 400 pairs.  Because women notice these things.  And you'd think that if women were so astute as to notice every damn thing that they would just get over poop issues.  But something in our psyche does not allow it.  So we continue to live up to the unrealistic expectation that women never poop.  Even though we all know that the other ones do."

"event","The weekends just pass to0 fast anymore.  

Saturday I picked up some around the apartment and then gave up thinking that I would finish it on Sunday.  I didn't finish it though so the place looks comparatively messy with how it was on Friday.  Oh well, I did nearly finish the hat and scarf for ""T"" though, that'll be one holiday gift down and about a zillion to go, but it's a start.  

Yesterday I went to CT with my Dad and helped him close up the cabin.  The end of the season is always a little sad but it's so pretty there this time of year that it more than made up for it.  I was also looking forward to getting some apples on the way home, but apparently, with the drought the apple crop in the area was about 1/3 of the usual.  So none of the roadside stands were boasting them as part of their wares.  I'm sure that John will be disappointed that there is no apple pie on the horizon in the near future."

"event","So I think that I am very close to being a full-on slacker at work.  I seem to have cultivated the same skills I used in school to beat the system, doing well while doing the bare minimum required of me.  I could labor over every detail and make up tasks to do, but I've lost all motivation to go above and beyond the call of duty.  I hope that sometime soon this methodology will pay off and I'll stop suffering all of the stress related garbage that I seem so prone to, like feeling sick all the time."

"event","So I had a fun weekend.  Got to go to the fabric/craft store which is just the ultimate as far as I am concerned.  I don't know why I like it so much.  I am sure it is partly because these type of stores remind me of good times with my mom.  Probably also because it is a place to be creative which I don't know if most people get a lot of that in their 9-5 worlds.  I know that I don't, unless you count ""bullshitting"" as an art form.  

I plan to crochet gifts for Christmas this year so I picked out some yarn for a hat and scarf for T (my dad's girlfriend.)  There is a certain color wheel that is just for T, it has kind of a deep aqua blue on it, a green, a purple and a pink of the same tones.  All very blue tones I suppose.  So I got a T purple.  I think she'll like it.  I hope I got enough though, its a thick yarn and so its hard to gage weather 3 skeins will do the job.

So yesterday I woke up and I had a sore throat, so I took some Advil and tried to forget about it as John, the kids and I tromped around the mall.  Today though, my tonsils are so big they are practically touching. I am starting to feel nauseated from all of the Cloraseptic I have sprayed on them just to be able to keep talking on the phone.  ""As needed"" is just about the worst thing that anyone can put on a label for me, sure enough I will have enough of it in my system to sedate an elephant in short order.  Talking on the phone is about 30% of my job.  In case you are curious the other parts are 30% e-mailing and 30% making up shit to talk on the phone about and e-mail.  I am required to be a happy camper with clients and others at all times.  For a person who's very friendly but prone to melancholy moods and macabre humur it can sometimes be likened to being in hell.  I am sure it would be different if my company wasn't in the toilet, but this is the hand that I am dealt so I must play it.  My tonsils, however, are staging an anarchy."

"event","It was suggested to me last night that I could use this journal as a forum to review the many, many books I read.  Everyone has at least one addiction and I'd venture to say that reading is definitely in my top three if not #1 on the list.  

As much as cigarettes cost in NYC now-a-days, I think were I to purchase all of my reading materials in paperback at retail, my books per week habit would be just about on par with a pack-a-day smoker.  Example, my most recent read ""Lost"" by Gregory Macquire set me back $14.95 at Barnes & Noble, two packs of cigarettes about $14 now and it took me two days to read the book - see the logic here?

So maybe I can help someone save their pennies on any of the crappy shit I come across so that people can smoke more cigarettes, pay more taxes and keep animal shelters open 24 hours in NYC."

"event","Well, I set my mind to spending less time bitching about how much my job sucks today and I got a whole lot more done.  It's a vicious cycle though.  Sometimes I wish that I was an under achiever, I think that life would be a lot less stressful.  But somehow somewhere way back in early childhood I set up these high standards and expectations and now I must plod on.

There is a remote possibility that I might run off to Germany for a week for Oktoberfest or however you spell it.  It sounds like an awful lot of fun but I honestly don't know if I have the energy to go on a trip right now.  

I don't know whether I'm fatigued for some reason like stress or illness or maybe I'm becoming some sort of hypochondriac.  Most of the time I am fine and then sometimes I have times like yesterday evening where it was all I could do to remain conscious while I lay on the couch.  A very small part of me thinks that I should follow these episodes and see where they lead but the majority of me just feels guilty about indulging the laziness of being that way.  Sometimes I think that maybe John will get fed up with these bouts since the majority of women in his life, romantically and otherwise, seem to be crazy in some way.  But maybe that is why he puts up with it."

"event","Today is the first day of on=line journal keeping.  Hopefully this will be a greater success than writing all of this with a pen and paper. Writing by hand has just become too laborious to do anymore since my typing speed far surpasses my hand writing.  Plus, this is hopefully a better alternative to blow off steam at work during idle moments than bugging everyone I know on IM, which is all of 4 people, 2 of whom are never logged on.

Maybe someday I'll even get brave like John and start poop-typing my messages.  Don't let your legs fall asleep!"

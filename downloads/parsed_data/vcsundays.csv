"event","i dont think i would ever date someone who is as old as my mom. that means the guy im dating is 55 ,that also means he is three generations older than me. If some one is more than a generation older then you and is dating you there is something wrong with the picture that is my opinion though."

"event","so heres a stry for everyone. Me and fred went to the river with a group of friends and we decided after a morning and afternoon of drinking and beer bongs that were going to go on a jet ski ride. I hop on with fred asking him if hes okay to drive and he says yes. Were cruisin for a couple of minutes and we go around this cove and fred goes around the cove at the same time a guy coming the opposite way in a speed boat does and they end up colliding .. i would just like to thank god that i was thrown off before the impact. if i would have been on the jet ski when we crashed going like 4omph i would probably be dead. So i come up out of the water and i have no idea therehas even been a accident until i see fred kind of slouched down on the jet ski and i see foam in the water. After that everything just kind of went in slow motion. The boat has been hit right down the middle and it is now breaking apart into about five diffrent pieces and the guy on the boat is standing on the bow of the boat as his boat is sinking to the bottom of the colorado river.Me and fred have sunk a boat as im lying there in the water i see beer cans all over so instantly know the guy had been drinking. we try to get back on the jet ski ands it start to sink. Then we see a boat coming to save us and they come and pick us up and try tyo tow us back .By this point i know me and freddy are alright im just thinking about how we have been drinking all day and im not 21. So the cops come and pick us up off these peoples boat. Turns out the cops are really cool, they are talking to us about NASCAR and shit . Then they got a statement from both of us . Here comes the shitty part they start giving fred the drunk test and he goes all the way through until they give the breathalizer and he blows over the limit. The cool part is that the cop filed all this under arizona law so freds licence is okay the other guy in the accident got arrested under california laws. Freddy just got a fine it looks like. The jet ski we were on looks like it went into a brick wall the engine was hanging out ther was no more front end. There was someone up there watching us. The jet ski gets towed back to camp and the people who towed it back said i was drving but heres something i dont even know how to drive a jet ski so thats impossible. the image of the accident keeps going throguh my head how we cheated death ..wow i guess. We have to buy a new jet ski and we dont really know what the situation with the boat is .. but the other guy had been drinking to so i dont really know how all that goes. im gonna go to bed now oh by the way i have been having back spasms since tuesday i think i fucked my back up."

"event","so todya my dad calls me right hes like your in big trouble so of course im like oh crap apparently i went over like a thousand minutes on the cell phone big fuckin deal ill pay you the fifity bucks. But no he just starts ripping into me telling me that im a cold hearted person and saying that im not doing anything with my life and that all i do is waste money. He always brings up shit from the pasat just to intentionally hurt my feelings. Then he says to the only reason i have high blood pressure is because of you and he tells me that i treat my mom like shit and i have to admit me and my mom have a pretty strained relationship its not a very natural relationship very forced. okay so i have this thing against my brother right now. my brother decided that he was going to buy a house in vegas like all of the sudden had no plan no job lined up nothing. So my dad goes with him and my dad gives my brothermoney for the down payment like 8 thousand dollars. My brothers chick who he met on the internet moves across the country to live with him . So now my brother wants to move back after only living there for a year he just wants out of the deal my dad doesnt want the money back i guess cuz he doesnt say anything. Then he bought my brothers chick a car... ( they did pay him back though)okay so im jealous big deal im just jealous cuz if my brother fucks up its no big deal but if i mess up im a big loser my brothers 28 and went to junior college for like 9 years. so my dad is calling me all these names and sating i am a uncaring person and none knows the real side of me ...hes my dad hes not supposed to just see the bad sides of me and bring me down as a person .. i think my dad intentionally likes to make me cry because he knows he has that power over me . and freddy calls me today and im all sweet on the phone with him and  i get off and my dad goes "" whens fred going to know the real side of you"" whats with the charade. I said the reason im nice to fred is beacuase he is nice to me. Its a two way streak. fred knows all sides to me and doesnt judge me .. im just in a depressed mood i guess."

"event","so i have been doing all kinds of projects and tests for school this week i am so happy the semester is almost over i think im going to do summer school . a online class and probably economics and anthropology. i have just realized over the past few weeks how comfortable i am around freddy i can really be myself which is awesome because im a pretty crazy chick. Fred is there for me through it all and doesnt judge me which is insane. i mean i have never met someone like him  and i am so happy that i love another person unconditionally.wow i just sounded so sappy whatever.  so i have been going on my space so much lately its likev an obsession with me . i get excited when people messgae me , maybe im just starved for friends or something. haha wow heather you are so sad. so everyone around meis pregnat or having a baby lets see renee just had a baby, tiffany, briana, my cousin dawn, heather ( freds bros chick), this girl i worked with liezel, and definitly not me. on that note i have to write my preschool paper ."

"event","My mom's brother Basil got married a a year and a half ago, he was 52. The last of the 12 siblings to get married because he was the typical rich playboy and insisted that he wouldn't ever settle down until he really felt like he couldn't live without the lady he would marry. He finally did get married though, to a divorcee who already had a 7 year old son from a previous marriage. We called her ""New Aunty"" HAHA. 

S: Was it worth the wait?
B: Definitely worth the wait.

Kudos to her on being accepted and settling well into our family, my mom's side are incredibly loud and obnoxious and anyone who can put up with ALL of them, deserves a medal. She was 16 years younger but changed his playboy ways, they moved onto a huge beautiful estate with wedding photos posted all over the house. 3 months ago they had twin boys, Dylan and Ryan and just two days ago Uncle Basil legally adopted Michelle's son Aaron. They were now a family of 5.. as you know, all good things come to an end, but so fast? Last night ""New Aunty"" was at home with the babies when the part time amah found her passed out on the couch and both babies on the floor, Michelle had passed away unexpectedly and is her body is currently undergoing an autopsy. They think it's an aneurysm. It was very unpredictable and she leaves behind Uncle Basil with 3 sons, 2 of which were still breast feeding, on a huge estate with no wife/mother to his boys. I cannot even begin to even imagine the pain he feels. I thought stuff like that only ever happened in the movies, and if did happen in real life, I never thought it'd hit so close to home. It weird though, because it seems so fated, like with the whole adoption thing being official the day before.

So, from the wise words of my father, study hard but party harder, nothing lasts forever.

<i>Rest in Peace and God Bless.</I>"

Thank the lord. Though now my lacrosse ish starts again. In fact it started tonight. From sever to nine, you were probably at home either doing homework, out with friends, or sitting on a couch, day dreaming about summer and in the back of your mind I am sure you thought, ""Hmmm, I wonder what Annie's doing right now...""

I will tell you, not to fear. From seven to nine pm, I was running my ass off at practice with all these really fit hydrated people. I realize I am not the best when it comes to running, but I can hold my own when I'm prepared. Though today I was really dehydrated (probably cause I haven't sipped water in the past three weeks). I was dizzy and wanted to stop, but I kept going and going and I felt so good afterward. I mean it was no picknick while I was running the never-ending laps around and around and the sprints afterward. I wanted to die. BUT, after, I had an endorphine high and it was FUNNN. OH and they gave us all this sweet gear and new sticks. whoa. I was like, I don't deserve this cause I'm so lazy. Though I took it and am keeping it anyway.

SUMMER IS SO CLOSE. I AM SO DONE WITH HOMEWORK (I think I was done with it about three months ago actually).
I am going to be depressed at some point during the summer beacuse I know I will not get to see everyone. They will al travel and go places and have things to do, which will be sad. Then I remember I have no obligations really and all that depression subsides. Still. This summer better be good."

"event","I feel it is about time that I make an entry in LJ after abandoning it for so long. Today is an entry worthy day!

So I spent this weekend doing really random things. I went out on Friday with people tyring to get tickets to XMEN 3, but sadly it was sold out. We all decided to stay and walk around bridgeport for a few hours and have dinner. We stopped in Urabn Outfitters where Dylan made a very special, cute purchase.

Then we went to california pizza kitchen and sat forever talking about random things. The end

I saw the Da Vinci Code last night and I thought it was ok, but already having read the book, the movie seemed anticlimactic and even prehaps... predicatable. 

I FINALLY RESERVED AND AM GAURENTEED A PUPPY ON JUNE 10TH, 2006!! She is the cutest puppy in the world (i think). She's a yellow lab with a soft coat and twinkly eyes. I'm still pondering names like: KEIRA (my dad likes Keira Knightly in Bend It), CALLIE(""beautiful"" in Greek, TESS (my brother's idea), HOLLY, HEIDI... you can comment on your favorite if you want or give me ideas for names. I am needing suggestions. I walked into her pen with all her brothers and sisters and she was sleeping with a kitten squished next to her. It was quite adorable. Kodak moment! I could go on, but I will spare you.

After that fun visit I went to my grandparent's for dinner (sortakinda like in gilmore girls) where I learned that my macho, Jewish grandpa sold bras and hosery to poor unsuspecting women back in the day. He would stick his extremely hairy arm into a stocking leg and show the color of the hosery against his MANLY skin. How awkward? He said, and I quote, ""I was a Hoser."" I love that man."

"event","Aight, below is the annoying quiz, that I find really amusing. Fill it out if you want, and are feeling like you need a break from improtant things, or don't, no pressure.

The other day I saw pocahontas for the 1st time in a long time. I'd say it's been about 5 or 6 years. It was the most enjoyable experience. I felt like I was a kid again, without a care, just hanging out watching this fabricated love story threaded into a true history. But honestly, I don't care if it didn't really happen, because that's not the point. The point is that it made me happy. I found that I still know the lyrics. Maybe that's because I watched it all day every day when I was little? I need to purchase that movie, but I think it's in the ""Disney Vault"", sealed away until they decide to ""restore"" it and beautify it. Til then I will be waiting... 

Can you say obsessed?

Ok I just wrote this whole paragraph about Corbet and how he scares me, but I also really like him and I think he likes me, but of course I deleted it with the touch of a button. I have no idea how. In short, I feel like if I show up to that class with no homework I will be sent to hell. Which in some ways is good cause I always, without fail, have my homework as does the rest of the class. He told us that ""I am suprised at this year's class because usually by this time my gradebook is spotted with missing assignments, but your class seems to have all their work in."" I wanted to shout, it's cause you scare the crap out of us, but I restrained myself. Thank God.

We almost beat grant in our lax game. We took it into overtime tied 8 to 8, but they pulled ahead in sudden death by 4. That really pissed me off, but I was proud, cause we lost to them 15 to 3 in our previous game against them. Wohoo.

"event","A Short Summary of Social Events of my Week:

I love being able to do things on weeknights! It's really relaxing not having to have that nagging feeling in the back of your mind, like you are missing something. ahhhh *sigh*

I went to ""She's The Man"" (the Amanda Bindes/Bines chick flick) and it was amazing. I didn't think that a girl dressing as a guy could fool so many. The world suprises me sometimes. I love how in movies you can just suspend reality and you can go with the plot even though it's completely ridiculous. I am honestly going to purchase that film when it comes out / I am going to see it again in theatres. I don't know why, but it was just such a feel good movie that makes you happeeeee.

After the movie Robyn, Nicole and I crashed the dormie bowling trip because, frankly, there was nothing else for us to do, and we ( I ) had a really good time. I haven't bowled for a while, but I wasn't as bad as I had assumed. Robyn is a beast at bowling though. I said it was because she's Canadian. I don't know why that helps, but... I know it does somehow. 

Today, I went to starbucks twice (the 2nd time only as a chauffeur) After school Nicole and I worked on our Digital Portraits until 8pm. That was insane. I was mezmorized for about 5 hours and I finished. Nicole was good company because she put up with me singing to every sone on the radio. Now that I have finished my first portait I am moving onto my 2nd. I am making a portrait of my brother's favorite actor, Bill Murray. I found a sweet picture of him in his ""costume"" from The Life Aquatic, which is him in a little red beanie, a blue collared shirt and some aviators. It's a fun way to make a birthday present for my bro. The biggist plus is that it happens to be free! I'm cheap!


I love how 6th grade my week was: a pg 13 movie, cosmic bowling, arts & crafts and birthdays!

I remember Cosmic Bowling was THE SHIT in middle school. Still is..."

I was this close to starting to study at 7, then Rahael called from mexico and I really wanted to talk to her... so I did. 

She told me that gwynneth was out in the sun for hours at a soccer game so she got a horrible burn and possibly got something close to a heat stroke. I was freaking out because Rahael said she was really sick at the time, but now she is getting better, so, therefore. my life can go on.

"event","Today turned out to be a really good day despite my skepticism. I thought that I would be really depressed because all of my really close friends have left for Mehico, but in fact, I found some friends to chill with who made me vary happy. I met Yen at 7 at the mall where we shopped around for about 2 hours. It was very tiring and all I found was a shirt. I did buy a ring from claire's that I really like. Yeah cool story, but Yen kept me company. We stopped at the Cheesecake factory on our way out and bought a slice. It tasted good going in, but it made me kind of sick (again) afterwards. We stopped at Freddy's stocked up on some dinner stuff then went to OES. I hung out in her dorm room for about two hours with Diana too. I really appreciated how nice they were and how they made me feel not like a loner. I realized that I hang out with certain people way more than others...

Was there an earthquake tonight? Maybe it was just Yen and I, but we felt a rumbling and a loud noise. maybe it was the Cheesecake that caused hallucinations. Shit, who knows?

My rents dropped me as well as and my grandma who is in a wheelchair cause she thinks she's disabled. It was slightly embarassing to be pushing her around and I felt bad for not wanting to be seen with her. Idid get some door holds though from some hot men so it was all ok. (they were probably like ""who's the loser munchkin with the granny?"") We had like an hour wait so I went to brookstone and got a massage from this chair that was AMAZING. It like knew where I was soar. It was so unnatural. My gran has a slight case of dimentia so she offered me cake like 20 times and each time I felt obligated to eat a piece cause she was like insistent so I got home and felt so sick. The cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory sucks. What a let down. Good story...

I was innocently playing ultimate frisby at OES and we got sent away by a rent-a-cop? Why is OES so f-ed up? Twas only 10... we weren't breaking any laws. WTV, now I can say I got busted by a cop and proceed to make up a better side story. hah

I talked to Alex Platt for about an hour about some random shit while awards were being presented (parents glared). It was great, I really appreciated his humor cause I haven't talked to him in FOEVAH. I also talked to Sam Prichard who actually participated in science fair even though he doesn't go to OES? Oh well, he is still funny and basically the same. I love those kids. They made middle school so memorable. *sigh*

Oh and now I am sitting at home where Elsa and Alix and I have been hanging out and ... sitting. Story of my life. Although in Lax today we ran three miles again (2.8) and we also did like 11? sprints. It was really tiring, but I feel good about my improving endurance. I am not the fastest, but I am not the slowest. That's all I care about really. I set my goals lower so as to avoid disappointment... yesss.

P.S. My friends have boyfriends who buy them Tiffany's and diamond rings.... and I get nada. (what is wrong with the world) Since when do new, TEENAGE relationships cost that much. It's crazy, or I'm just jealous either way something's up. hmmm

I finished science fair too! Lauren and I had a sweet time putting our damn good board together. She is so entertaining. I love it when you find those ppl that you just get along with all the time. It was jollygood because we also went for a run to OES and passed the lax ball around on the field. Sagar was at OES coaching his girls' Bridlemile team. He was a beast. He worked those little kids. I felt badly for them because they were all breathing really hard, like little sweatshop workers (whatever that means). I guess it's good for 'em in the end, but wow. I would be tempted to kick scott if he yelled at me continually. Welcome to Varsity I guess.

The dynamic of the lax team feels so weird because I have this feeling that I'm not part of a real clique on the team. I find myself looking for a familiar face I can just walk up to and I find very few. It's just weird because I realized that I always pick sports that none of my really close friends are in. For example, Rahael, Gwyn, Erin and Laura all play tennis this season. Oh well. I think variety is a good thing. It's fun.

Ok, because I am feeling really optimistic I am going to advertise on lj:

 I am selling jewelry (mostly earrings) down in The Gallery. It's really reasonably priced with some sweet beadage, good quality.

I have that feeling where I am missing something, like I didn't know I was at a loss without it until now...but I don't know what IT is. 
I want to leave. I want to see light. I have been here on this couch for days, wallowing in self-pitty. 
My thigh is twitching, reminding me that my legs have carried me no further from here than my bed. 
I need to see POEPLE. I need my friends. This fever better break, or else I might have to ""slap a bitch"".

This could be my fever talking but I am so sad. It's like a culmination of all my emotions, built up over the past few weeks, packed into this late night. I feel like I need a soundtrack to emphasise each thing I am feeling. That happens to me a lot though. If I am sitting alone, really happy, I have to find that really good song that makes me want to dance and appreciate everything. Similiarly, if I am sad, I like those songs that catch you in your weakened state. You think the song will calm you, when really it exposes melancholic emotions, it just makes you want to cry. The lyrics in some songs really get to me, so much so that I feel like I wrote each word.

Current song of choice: 

Breath - Anna Nalick


Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable,
And life's like an hourglass, glued to the table.
No one can find the rewind button, boys,
So cradle your head in your hands,
And breathe... just breathe,
Oh breathe, just breathe 


I wish I could rewind to when I was little and could just sit in awe of the world...

P.S. I am trying to breath, but the mucous clogging my nasal cavity is making this a rather arduous task to complete"

"event","This is about Into the NIght, so only read if you wish:

The busride there was funnn. I realized Jews have really small bladders because we stopped so many times that we got there later than expected. At first it started out that I was in the front of the bus with Robyn and her friends that I had met before the ride, but then I moved to to back with Ben, Sam and BEJ, where I had a good time. They make me laugh. Mostly I talked to Ben and Sam, then I met this advisor named Jonhnothan, who was really awesome. He had a really good sense of humor and was at that age where he can still talk to kids our age without seeming like an adult. You know when you are in a situation where you meet someone older than you and realize that if you were their age you would want to be their friend? no yes? Well, anyways, that's how it was for me. Cool dude. I then proceeded to talk the whole busride with the usual suspects as well as some new ppl. Had a blast. 

We got there and gathered in the gog, where we were debreifed by the advisors, then were set loose. They had dinner there, but I had no interest in eating, sorta seemed impractical. I dunno why, so I just walked around and talked to people. Mostly Robyn was my hostess and introducted me to people. I love Robyn's friends, they are entertaining. We danced and socialized and sat and saw other Jews hook up. They were everywhere. It was great. 

While she went off and talked to poeple Ben and I stuck together because Sam had other friends to talk to and BEJ was involved with other stuff, hah, and uhh yeah, so ben and I were a team. good times. I think we bonded a little bit from that. We fell asleep on the couch together. Some prime realestate compared to the wooden bench we occupied for about 30 min. I slept for like 2 hours at five and woke up a little after seven. 

What I thought was hilarious was the fact that I left Sam in this one game room playing ""catch phrase"" (where he had been THE WHOLE EVENING) with other jews and came back after sleeping and he was in the same seat. I laughed so hard. 

Services in the morning were horrible. I was too tired to stand. I sat between BEJ and Ben. I tried to sing along, but I was just too dead, BEJ had to help me up a few times from my seat. All that sitting and standing was taxing. Then we ate breke wich was of course bagels and schmear. 

The busride home yesterday was fun. I slept for part of the time due to my exhaustion, but I also sat around with Sam S, Robyn, har friend Maya and Bella as well as Benhamin. 

Ahhhh. Ok no more about jews for a while.

What a man. I am thinking I want to meet some really hot Jewish guy. I am hoping there are some of those there. I'm thinkin ""ahyes"".

My mom called me to warn me there was a tree in the road on the way out of our neighborhood. I didn't even need to go out that way, but she called me just in case I ""missed it"". Hah, yes I think it would be hard for me to see an enourmous tree blocking my way, easily missed. One word: CAMOFLAGUE. I can see the concern, but really?

I just saw the remake of The Pink Panther. Ok, I have to admit, I never thought it would be better than the originals... cause that's just impossible, but Lia and Rahael and I were in a really good mood, so it was good humor for us at the time. Really stupid, but we laughed so hard whilst Elsa and Ryan and Erin HAD to go to Final Destination III. Wow, the third one must be really good. Third times the charm...Love those guys.

Before the movie at the mall this kid came up to us, obviously as a dare and he was really funny. He claimed to be from one of the many ""stan"" countries where they have ""many pools"". He was nice. Met some funny ppl that evening. 

Ahh weekends are good."

We just finished watching the OC. I feel weird writing on lj while they are sitting here, but I am highly entertained by multitasking between writing about my day and watching some crazy ass procedure preformed by a doctor that was two seconds ago crying because someone in their family died. The doctors on the show are such heroes. I aspire to be able to do more than one thing at a time like that. Seems hard. Doing homework without getting completely distracted is hard enough. 

Soo, yeah, my parents are the most embarassing people I know. HOLY LORD! and my friends think they're funny? what is with that? I dunno...

Other than homework the weekend was fun. Semi was a good time. Brian was a fun date. He is a good guy. Even though maggie was a little unprovoked yenta... I wont go into it. (I really enjoy maggie's company. She is like non-stop entertainment) I went to dinner with him, Maggie, Sam S and Elsa (of course, mi solo amiga). That part was ok. it was a little weird cause it was just a strange dynamic. We went to the dance and then everything became 20 times more exiciting. Dancing was funnn. I hate it when poeple are really serious when they dance, for instance some people touch themselves all over and like rub their hair, trying to look sexyish? (Can I get a Mia Garret? Love that kid) which looks just weird, then there are some people who are like loose cannons that are intense, trying to look professional. Those kind of dancers really spice up that dance floor. I just like to keep it simple with the sprinkler, the shopping cart and the occasional hammer dance...yeeahh 

Now there's all this drama with Maggie not dancing with Sam at semi and it makes me laugh. 

I had forgotten what the Forestry center looked like and I went to set up for the dance and the moment I walked in I thought, ""whoa, this looks eerily like my grandparents basement. I mean this in the nicest sense. The stone floors and the worrd siding just looked uncannily like their basement. Good times. Hopefully dancing like that didn't occur at my grandparants house with kids groovin to a 70's version of ""get low"", which would be something more like ""get high"". 

Nonetheless it was a good location. Fun stuff. I enjoyed dancing like a nerd as usual.

P.S. Saying my myspace drives me crazy cause it sounds like I have a stutter. Especially if you say it quickly, as I am doing it now. It's funny to me at least. hah whew, I get laughs from a lot of stuff."

"event","Today was a good day. I woke up at about 11:00 (early for me) fully energized. When I woke up I had a message from Laura asking if I wanted to go shopping for a semi dress and of course, I had to go. I called Laura to tell her I could go and she said ""oh I am already on the way"" That was a fun day out with Laura and her Colombian Parents. They are funny folk. I loved sitting in their car listening to their conversation in spanish. I pretended not to be listening, but they sound so suave. They all just came by picked me up and we looked for about two hours on 23rd and of course found nothing (all too expensive or looked like...shit). That is the thing about being a girl. You can really enjoy getting all dolled up, but sometimes you can't find that ""perfect thing"", in this case a dress, so you get frustrated spending all that time looking. Or at least that's just me...It's all part of the ""experience"". Beside the point, Laura went to get a Horse today or at least look at one, which is sweet. Much envy/admiration here.

With my parental units I went to see Pride and Prejudice and I was definiely not looking forward to it... until I saw Emily and her mom, going to the SAME movie and she saved my evening. Emily is so fun and nice. And, if you read this I hope you know you were really fun to be with. Thanks for happening to be there! SUPER! That movie is ok... I had already seen it so it wasn't that good the 2nd time. It's decent. We thought Mr. Darsy was hott, but the ending is so cheesey. I did not like it. You had to put all that effort into seeing their love bloom and wither that seeing their only physical expression of love in the form of a kiss was just a let down.

I then went out to dinner and proceeded to eat too much tofu veggie stir fry which was soo goood. It distracted me from how much my parents talked about boring stuff. They embarass me. That is a major indicator that I am most definitely a in my moody teen stage.

Basically my brother (19 years old) has fucked up my social life. Because Mark is such a genius that he screwed up so many times (drinking, violating numerous laws simultaneously, as well as frequently) that my parents automatically think I am like that. I get my lisence, my dad threatens me. If I break 6 months, basically... I dead woman. No one cares and essentially I don't care, but if I ever disappointed my parents I would be soo full of guilt that it would eat me from the inside out. Why is it that I can't do those things without freaking out and being stupid, while my brother as well as almost every other person in the world can without a care in the world? Even Kokobun drove with a new driver! DEAR GOD! Why do I have these morals? Where the fuck did they come from? I almost think they are not really morals, it's more like fear of getting caught. I can't stand to have someone, especially my parents dislike me for stupid reasons. They will still love me as parents, but I saw what it did to my brother's relationship with them. In short, what I am trying to convey is that MY BROTHER RUINED MY LIFE AND LEFT ME HERE ALONE TO DEAL WITH MY CRAZY ASS PARENTS. I miss having that guy here. I miss having someone who will judge me and act like a dick, but will still be the coolest, funniest person around.

I SOUND LIKE AN OOBER NERD.... oh wait, I am one, and damn proud. *cough*

Blah. I am such a boring person lately. I feel like I am not the person I used to be and I am not going where I want to end up. I don't know what I want. Well, I do, I want love. I want to find that person that you know you were meant to be with, at least until you realize otherwise. (not love from someone who squeezes your cheeks and calls you ""punm"".  I feel so bland. I need to be more... ""spicy"". Yes that would be awesome.

Oh one thing I am extremely frustrated about is that Myra or as us AASK tutors know her ""rainbow"". asked me to write this short 1 to 2 minue bio about a famous Jewish woman that I admire and who lobbied for peace. I found this woman named Golda Meir. She is pretty cool. I am not embarassed to talk about her. I just don't want to sound stupid. I don't want to get nervous (cause I usually do in front  of a formal audience). AND Myra happened to ask me a day before the chapel. Thanks a lot. You know a little notice wouldn't hurt. I know most OES ppl don't give a shit about chapel and just want to get through the boring lecturers so I hate being in this position, cause I know I would be bored out of my mind if I had to listen to that. I am not very intregueing. This is why I will stop writing.

I am so relieved that it we have finally reached winter break. At least it's a break well deserved, unlike the breaks I take weekly by not doing my homework. I have made another new years resolution beside the one I made earlier. I will resolve to work really hard on homwork and actually do it next year. I will get better grades and yes, yes I will get all A's? Nah, but I guess I can dream.

This week has been crazy. I took my last finals, which btw were quite varying in difficulty. I.e, I owned my intro to fit final which isn't that great of an acheivement, but it's something. I honestly knew everything on that test and took up all 4 pages of paper available. On the other hand, there was my chemistry test that owned me. I actually did well on the first section, then when it came to the conversions I just got confused and blah. They aren't hard, I am just really thick. It wasn't that bad, I just felt like I got the wrond answers. I am really unsure. The end of that test was really peculiar... If you want to know you can ask, but I wont bore you. 

THIS WEEKEND:

I went to a friends house and watched The Notebook and inevitably balled my eyes out. Wow, I want to find a guy like that. 

ESCAPING on saturday was sweet. Oh god, I had fun. I would do that again any day. There were like 30 OES ppl there, haha. 

NORRIS it SNOWED! Yay for you. IWhen I saw it I got a mental picture of you leaping for joy.
 I am so excited. I think I am going to go sledding with Laura if it stays like this. 

My brother is home from Cali and it's so much fun. Today our power went out. I must admit I was sad at first. I sat lounging in front of the gas fire place all day UNTIL our neighbors, who happen to be our cousins came over. We watched The Godfather on a previously charged laptop. That movie was great. I thought it would only be appealing to the males in the group, but we all liked it. Wow, what a day. The power did finally come on at about 10:00pm, but I loved seeing our house full of candles.

I was sick today (but really I was only exhausted to the point of sickness) I woke up this morning at 6am when my alarm went off. I had to set it at the other end of the room just to get my ass out of bed, but not to anyone's suprise, it didn't work. I got out of bed, stumbled across the room and hit the snooze button, then fell back into bed and pulled my warm covers up around my face and inevitably fell back asleep. It felt so good. About ywo hours later my mom came in my room and told me to get a move on. I opened my eyes and knew that I wouldn't make it through the day without having a mental breakdown or something of that nature. You know when you just need a rest day, just one... or a month's worth? But still, I am so tired, even after my rest day. I have work to do that basically takes up my whole life. I have never felt so bland and boring until now. My life almost feels like it's on repeat (refer to the move Groundhog's day for more info. It's not necessarily bad because what I need now is reliability and familiarity, but this pattern isn't what I imagined my life to be. I thought that I would be an A+ student with reliable friends that I always get along with, or at least I dreamt it. I am so tired of being an average student because not to sound pretentious, I know I can do better, a lot better. I have been doing horribly in math because it's ""just not my thing"". I have a late english paper and another to edit because ""I am so busy and afraid to put my words on paper"". I haven't started my age of faith paper because ""I have more important things to do"", which is a lie and I don't have assignments done in science because ""I don't get the lewis dot structure system"". This is all BS. I know I can get it if I actually take time to do my hw, instead of getting distracted with other things that interest me more. God! I am like a child who needs someone constantly monitoring my work, telling me what to do. But in another sense I am a teenager who is trying to break away from rule making superiors, attempting controlled independence. Wohoo for me. I am not depressed. I am just... here. I want to do better, but I just don't know how to manage my life. I see all these other perfectionist doing EVERYTHING at once and I don't know how it's done. They have honors classes and get good grades. Those people deserve awards or at least a badge that they can flaunt for heaven's sake. Did I really just say that...? for heaven's sake... Ok, I obviously need to sleep again.

Whenever I am sick or miss school, I always think something amazing happened like someone started a food fight, or Peter Langley sung a ballad in Gathering or someone other than me fell on their face in the great hall... From what I heard none of this happened, but a girl can dream."

I had a good weekend (minus the 1092323 hours of basketball managing that I had to to) Wtf is with all the work required. I guess I overlooked the whole service part of service learning. I actually have been learning a lot about basketball, bringing back some old memories of middle school bball. Frankly, memories I wish not to remember. Elsa and I are wrokin the stats sheet. Cool stuff. Maggie's nice too. Uh, after open mic, where I missed my tambourine solo, I went to erin's with the gand and had a good old fashioned girly sleepover. I forgot how fun those were. Good times.

Oh and Quel suprise, I had to manage bball on saturday too. woohoo. At least the girls' varsity are winning their games. They rock. I must say that the guys should be winning, but they always get way ahead at first then peak and from there lose their lead and slowly but painfully lose by about 10 pts by the end.

Elsa came over today and we watched part of the  portland pilot girls college soccer NCAA national title and they won championchips! woohooo

Don't you love it when you think you know someone really well, but then... you don't. Good times. Oh well, weight off my shoulders. 
Emily I appreciate your veiws on this, God damn it. I always appreciate you. 

Oh my god, this little quiz is basically defning the predicament I am in. Wow, I never knew... Ok I am officially shunned, i am a hippy, but a loser, wow, that is like the lowest form of being. Yessssss

The theme of the entry: bball
The moral: don't manage bball wether you have a life or not. It's too scary to quit. Coach Black is too tall to confront."

I went to palm desert and basked in the glorious sun as well as listened to the highly offensive ratial jokes (at least one a day i swear... even tho he isn't racist?) cracked by my grandpa. I sort of get offended by the jokes and I look around and everyone is laughing and I wondered where everyones priciples went. Yes, I too think it's weird that I talk about my grandpa on lj, but eh whatever. He is so funny he almost deserves it. I had a debate with him at dinner when he was a little drunk, and SUPRISE. I think I won! barely. Besides that the turkey was excellent and we watched the James Bond Marathon. Good stuff. Bond is such a womanizer, i think Gwyn or Rahael brought that to my attention, but I still think bond movies are sweet.

I also saw Mark who actually looks pretty decent for a college student. He isn't growing a beard and he has a tamed jew fro to my suprise.

Saturday I went to this Jew dance merging of BBYO/USY and I realized that I should have gone to scheckter not B'nai B'rith because all of the BBYO girls are ""whores"" according to robyn, Sam S and Brian as well as all USY peeps. I had no idea! They are nasty. All of the non-jewish ppl have no idea what i am talking about (but you're not missing out on my uneventful life), so to get to the point, the dancing was ok, not the greatest, but I got to know my fellow Oesian Jews better which was a plus. Robyn is nice. I have known her forever, but haven't really talked to her for a while. good times. 
 
My mom took me shopping today and it was glorious. I feel stylish. Sorta? hobo slacker style is a style right?

So i am watching Gosford park right now. It's this really good british murder mystery and I love it! I have seen it before, but it's even better the second time around. I love all british murder mysteries! It's like a drug.

Monday I am going to lia's to do watch xmas movies and make reindeer candy canes, COME SOPHOMORES!
Then I am going skiing on Tuesday with the gang! I haven't been to the mountain for many months hence  I am going to fall on my ass about 1000 times. 
On wednesday I am going to Palm Desert for Thanksgiv. I get to see him! I LOVE BROTHERS, even though he is in college and does not care. He is probably doing fun things and not even thinking about me : ( ugh. 
What a week...

I AM STILL HAPPY! Yay, break is sweet!"

Events that I am looking forward to and why: cause you are dying to know?

1) short school day on Friday: oh thank god, any excuse to have no class with Hope where she, no offense, might accidentally cause a heart attack with her lack of control over her volume.

2) Harry Potter 4: Oh yessss, HP nerds unite!

3) USY gathering: A bunch of jews dancing in the basement at Nevah Shalom Synagogue. It screams rave! I am not really excited, but I have been harassed by other Jews to go, so I feel obligated. I'll just check it out. Ahhh. Robyn you have to be my ""date""! PS What does USY stand for? United Semitic Youth? ehh

4)Girls Soccer Finals: Damn! That's gonna be sweet/they're gonna kick ass.

5)Thanksgiving break"" going to Palm Desert (warm and nice) to visit the Grandparents. My brother is gonna be there too! I miss that guy so much. Also, my grandparents are too funny/honest for their own good. Many good times in store."

I really don't like where our furbicle is right now. We are joined with the froshies (sounds like a blended drink). It is so uncomfotable, just because I really want to have our own space in stead of being jammed in the corner where all my shit gets stepped on by freshmen. 

Scott Sagar didn't show up for intro to fit today... come to think of it, he hasn't showed for the whole week, so it's not news. He used to tell us he wasn't coming, but now he is too lazy to even get us a sub. I am not complaining either, cause I really enjoyed having another free period, Scott is just unpredictable and off the wall.  Oh one plus to him not showing is us getting to do yoga with joel!!! lord.

"event","This weekend was a weird weekend. I saw Prime twice... Haha, that man is hot, the only reason I was even willing to go again was because of him. 

I had a great time getting to know the exchange students better. I was bummed that i didn't hang out with them more. They laughed at my jokes. YESSSS! So, I have been sitting around on my ass for like two days. I did go for a run. I am proud because I am perfectly content with sitting around, but I finally took some initiative. 

On the way home from dinner last night I rented the Notebook (have not seen that yet but i heard that it's a tearjerker) and the desperate houswives dvds. Wow, good show. I love all that drama. Those writers are telented. How great would it be to have a job that includes writing whatever you want and seeing all of these famous ppl act it out and then getting an award for your creativity. 

oh lord, teen life is comlicated... what a cliche"

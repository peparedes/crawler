"event","Well, today I went swimming for the first time in nearly... Two years probably! The water was super nice and soothing, I'm even contemplating swimming again tomorrow!

I made me mum sit and watch ""Beauty And The Beast"" with me because I'm cool like that. But, dang, that is such a splendid movie. It melts my heart and makes me giggle. I also have been watching it because OCP is doing a production of it this winter, I'd really like to be a part of it. It's such a sweet story. Heck, I wouldn't even mind being a spoon!

My interview was incredibly... Short. I mean, I knew it wasn't by any means going to be a long drawn out process but holy-crap. I feel like I must have appeared to be a freak or something >.<... I just hope I didn't fold... I am in desperate need of a job, and my parents are getting fed up with me and my... Jobless-ness. Too bad they don't realize how hard it is to find something, ANYTHING right now.

Hmmm... I feel like watching another cartoon..."

"event","So yeah... Once again I fell into the habit of... Not updating. So, I felt like posting a brief summary of my summer. Ready, set, go!

I've been searching up and down for a job, and I've been lead to place to place with no success... But it appears I may have a job at Mcdonalds... As horrible as that may be... I've heard terrible stories from people who worked there. It's apparently a very... upsetting enviornment to work... But meh, a job's a job!

Other than that my summer has been extremely boring, I've mostly sat at home taking care of Carrie. So, yeah... Better than drama I suppose.

Hmm.. I'm getting sleepy. Hopefully there will be more to come soon.

<3 hugs <3"

"event","So, it's been a long while... But anyways...<br /><br />We had auditions for the sound of music last week, with it being my last play I was hoping to get a decent role (Especially since I've never really had a big role in my four years of CAPA). I feel like Woodworth really likes getting my hopes up then disappointing me... It's clear the man doesn't like me, for whatever reason.<br /><br />During the first audition (We have to sing a prepared song) I sang <em>reflection</em> by Christina Aguilera. When I was through Woodworth asked me if I could play guitar, having never seeing the movie before I thought it was a pretty random question. Then, later on someone told me Maria plays guitar. SO, I had the idea in my head that if I made callbacks I would at least get a chance to read for Maria. I didn't, but that's okay because I read for Lizel.<br /><br />The role of Lizel came down to me and Rikki Jo Cunningham (This happened during the last play as well, it was me and her up for Helen of Troy... She got it.). I thought I did pretty well, considering I figured that Lizel would be the wholesome, innocent type... And Rikki Jo... Doesn't exactly fall in that category (Not to be mean...). After callbacks most people said I had it cause she made Lizel out to be a, well, seductress. So I thought , maybe, JUST MAYBE, for my last play ever I would have a decent role. But, I was wrong to hope for that... Because all it did was disappoint me. <br /><br />According to Mr.Woodworth Rikki got the part because she's a little taller than I am.<br /><br />I'm ranting on this because I don't want people to see me being diva about this ordeal... But nobody knows what it's like to lose 2 parts to the same person (Who is a freshman) your last year of theatre... I realize he wants what is best, but my God, it's high school theatre. He can't make a few sacrifices for the sake of someones self esteem?<br /><br />This is what CAPA has done for me... It has made me feel like crap about my height, my weight, my voice, and my overall appearance. I feel like no matter how well I read for a part, he always finds some dumb physical flaw I have so he can't cast me... Up until now I haven't cared too much, but spending four years in a group that really hasn't done anything but made you hate yourself feels like a big waste of time. <br /><br />I'm blowing this out of proportion, I know... There are people who are hurting way worse than me... Which makes me feel even worse about being bitchy about this... So yeah, if you're offended... I'm really sorry..."

"event","We worked out pretty hard today. We usually just do a workout video.

We did:
2 1/2 minutes of jump rope... Which doesn't seem like a lot... But I can't jump rope to save my life... ha ha

streched

did a weird leg lift thingy that worked the abs... (You would have to see it...)

20 minutes of non-stop aerobics... I had to run... 

We lifted... 
15 reps 
20 reps with a little more weight
25 reps with a little more...

Had to work with other lifting things in the weight room... I don't even know the names... 

We did that sit-up thing where you have a partner throw a medicine ball at you, then you sit back and throw it back at them when you sit up.

I don't even know what else we did. AND, my belly button ring fell out... He's lucky I found it. I would have thrown someone out the window had I not found it. >.<"

"event","Blocking for plays has always been chaotic and stressfull... Now it's chaotic and stressful times seven!

Mostly because it's a cast of teenage girls, with the exception of about 3 guys who don't have to come on a regular basis.

Which means PMS fills the room like whoa!

Then, yesterday Mr.Woodworth told us something...

""I think there are a few people on this cast who could stand to lose some weight.   So every week I'm going to keep track of your weight... During tracers the cast lost a combined weight of 35 lbs.""

Hmm... Lets think about this... Tracers was a cast of GUYS! We had girls ready to cry when they found out Mr.Woodworth was going to keep track of their weight... I'm not sure how I feel about it yet...

But... I really like food... So, I'll work out for him. But my eating habits are staying the same... ha ha.


Any-who!!

"event","Today started out pretty slow. I woke up, sat in my room for a good hour trying to figure out what I should do with my Saturday afternoon. I decided I would watch some flash movies on Albinoblacksheep.com. Then I had a bright idea... Maybe I could try to make a silly movie for media. So I picked a song...

Bette Midler's ""I'm beautiful Dammit'!""... Next I had to think of something funny to do...

Now, to be honest, I have nothing against Bette Midler. She's an okay person/celebrity to me. But I guess I was in a cruel mood...

I went to google to search for a picture of the ugliest dog I could find...

Once I tracked the dog down I saved it, got onto photoshop, and did different things to it. Such as opening it's mouth, tilting it's head, rotating it etc...

Now on to movie maker...

Now... Bette Midler is a dog... Muahaha....


Yep... But I only got about 30 seconds of it done... It takes a long time to put something like that together...

Then I got a call from Ryan. Yesterday we discussed him coming over if he could get his chores done, he also wanted to make dinner... Again.

Well, my mother talked him out of the dinner because by the time he got his chores done it would have been too late anyways. So we just played the Disney trivia game for a while... I whomped him. ^.^ It was a lot of fun... There were some pretty hard questions on it. >.<

Then We watched Zoolander, one of my top ten favorite comedies. It was terrific having someone to watch  movies with for once. Someone who has the same humor as I do and won't trash the characters acting ability... I'm not saying any names mind you...

Yep... Wonderful, wonderful day. ^.^"

"event","So, I've decided I'm going to try to update the livejournal along with the Xanga as much as I can ( I've said this before... But I swear this Time I'll try harder... Ha ha).

According to an article Mr.Woodworth gave us last week, women have been conditioned to seek and play a lower status role. Because of how our culture has encouraged us to speak and act over the past 4000 years we have become more physically closed than men. We try to ""take up less space"" so to speak. Apparently women slump more so than men do (I like sitting up unusually straight so I guess I'm weird), which immediately affects how we are able to speak, and project. Another difference is how we stand. Somewhere in history women formed the habit of clasping our thighs together and only opening our legs past the knees. some women have a difficult time standing with their feet apart and squarely under the hips, simply because it isn't habit (It was at this point I looked at how I was standing... My legs and feet were together... Uh-oh).

""They also learn to protect their breasts and become round-shouldered. As a result their spines collapse in the centre, they stoop slightly and appear to be backing away even as they move forwards. women will tuck their heads, look down at the floor, devise their hair and fashions to hide behind.""

I found that to be true about me as well. This makes me a saaaaad panda...

But... On a brighter note...

I got the candle to go out!!!!!!!

It might have something to do with the fact that we were working on plosives... But... I'm still going to be proud dammit'!"

It really does have a great message. But it's sad as heck... When Dumbo See's his mom after she was put into solitary confinement... And she is rocking him with her trunk... I just can't handle it... It's ever so sad. I also forgot about when Dumbo and Timothy get drunk! That's actually how Dumbo realizes he can fly! lol. Hrm... I wonder what I should do now.

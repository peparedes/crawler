But wow....just wow!!! My life has been WOW....and confusing! But eh thats life right? Well today was my last day of school for this year!!! I am most definitely a BEAUTY SCHOOL DROPOUT now.....yeah not too fun!!!  Okay, now you are probably wondering why its my last day....a lil early for school to be out, right? Well, i havent been in school for the longest time cuz of my problems (ie ext. headaches, tremors, and fainting)!!!  So after how many days out of school and not being able to do the work....my teachers basically said that they ""rather see me withdraw than get an E"".  I agree with that but I DONT want to leave all of my friends!!! Also, this means that i....i...get to be a kewl FRESHMAN again next year!!! So i basically get to do my freshman year again....yeah not too fun!!!  and i am sooo NOT a SUPER SENIOR!!! haha


Beauty school dropout......I miss everyone already!!!"

"event","Well, Spring Break!! This year i went to Florida..same ol same ol!!  But this time it was because my grandma was rushed to the ER. She then had immediate surgery becuase of a perforated ulcer!! The scary part was that if she didnt get surgery she would have bleed to death!!!  I am just sooo thankful...THANK YOU GOD!!!  Luckily, my aunt uncle and lil cuzins were down there becuz if they werent then my grandma would be dead....wow thats a hard thought!  So we got plane tickets asap and went down there early sat mornin (10th).  So i had one day to pack!!! That majorly sucked...but that night i went to kels's so it was all good!!!  We watched cheaper by the dozen and all i have to say is....la sauce de croche!! wow that was funny felse hahaha! 
Neways, back to florida... I stayed with my other grandparents. My mom was in the hospital everyday with my grandma until she came home! The weather was ok there, Zephyr Hills. I mean i had a couple really nice warm sunny days and there were some rainy cold days too.  I didnt get to go parasailing tho!!! It was too windy...tear tear!! O well there is always next year...right kels! But i did a lot of shopping and thats always fun!! Especially with my grandma and papa...they crack me up!! So overall i had a great time!!!

And the best part is....my grandma is out of the hospital and should be home in Michigan in two weeks tops!!!  I love her soo much!!!"

"event","Um..this is very hard for me to say so please forgive me!!!

I got a call today in my third hour from my mother.  She called to tell me the result of some of the tests i had (mri, blood, tap, etc.)! She said that Dr. Jehnke (my neurologist) called her with some good and bad news!! 

I took the bad news first. And i think the term ""bad"" was putting it lightly.  I would say horrible devastating terrible....or life changing!!! The MRI results came back and...and it showed something bad the first time. The results had come back from the second MRI w/ dye and my worst nightmare came true!!

It showed that I....i....i uh have cancer.  I have severe brain tumors formed from a rare form of cancer.  Now they have done many MRI's before and this has never shown up!! But the doctor told my mom that with this form of cancer it doesnt show up until it gets into the most severe stages. The doctors don't know in what stage it is in yet until further testing. But it's not looking good!!!


I didn't even remember the good news...the ""bad"" news took over my mind...literally.   


The worst part is that they don't know how long I have to live...."

I also havent been able to go to skool....like at all (which most have you have probably noticed)!!! So i dont get to see any of my friends, which also hurts! AND i couldnt play any sports this year!!! Now if you know me, then you know that sports are my life!!

"event","I swear this has to be one of the worst days i have had in a long time!!! First off i didnt go to school because i had and still have a EXTREME headache and the shakes!!! then i found out that the doctors wanted to take me off medicine....well i already knew that. but what i didnt know is that they are taking me off the medicine ""midodrine"". i started taking this medicine to stop the fainting i had. well the so called doctors want me to stop that medicine becuz they think it is causing the headaches. so basically the situation is i get rid of the headaches i get the fainting back...i get rid of the fainting i get the headaches back. it's a lose-lose situation. WHEN AM I GONNA WIN!!! oh and another thing...becuz im stopping the medication i may not be able to go to Florida anymore!!! my parents tell me that they dont want me in a different state when there is a chance i can faint!! What the hell!!!! (excuse my language)


There is only one good thing that came out of this day so far...
I know i made the SAGINAW AAU VOLLEYBALL TEAM!!!"

"event","Well!!!  My doctors can't figure anything out for my headaches and tremors!! But they haven't been able to for a while. i think they gave up on me...seriously! all the doctors have been doing is puttin me on NEW MEDICINES!! i swear i have tried every single medicine that exisits! oh and probably every test too! Neways every time that i see each doctor now (i have a neurologist, cardiologist, physician, & social worker) all they say is that they dont know what to do until i go to ann arbor!!! (Well, for nebody that doesnt know, ann arbor is this huge medical complex and is supposed to be like #1 in the country or something.  They are supposed to work miracles!) ALL OF THE FAINTINGS, MIGRAINES, AND TREMORS STARTED ABOUT A YEAR AGO!!! You would think they would have an answer by now! 

so, i went to ann arbor on thursday and i had just a pleasant time haha! luckily i wasnt poked with nemore needles becuz i have been poked by enough of those!!! i spent around two hours going over my history of all of this. then the two doctors left for about a half hour to talk it over with a group of doctors.  so i was expecting this big answer to my problem! i was expecting a miracle! do you think i got that....NO!!!  All the doctors told me is to stop all medications and go from there! so, these fabulous doctors dont know what the problem is either! so one set of doctors is puttin me on medications and the other set is taking me of of them! So, basically they are doing nothin!!!   THAT'S SOME MIRACLE!!!


I really don't know if i will be NORMAL ever again!!!"

"event","So, this is my first entry!!! i am really confused right now!! and it's sooo stressful! for all of you that dont know, i have extreme headaches and tremors. i also had faintings but those are under control. so for everyone who has been asking...THAT IS WHY I HAVEN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL!!! so these million doctors i have can't figure out why i am having these migraines and tremors. therefore i have headaches and shaking, no school! which sux booty!!! last semester i had to drop down to three classes so i couldnt play volleyball. now this semester i cant play soccer becuz u have to have passed FOUR classes in the previous semester to play any sports. so i couldnt play soccer this semester (and i live breath play soccer). u think i would be a lil pissed? now this semester i had to drop down to four classes. BUT my parents teachers and counselors are pushing for me to drop out completely!!! that will screw me for ne chance of sports for next year. also when in the hell am i supposed to see everyone!!! also if i drop out then i might not be able to even graduate w/ my class!  i mean class of 007...hello freakin awesome! (another thing that suckz ass is im four days too young to do drivers training this summer but thats a whole separate thing) can you see why i may be just slightly confused frustrated freaked!! ahhhhhh...
pleez tell me your opinion or suggestion or nething!

I just want to thank all of my friends who have been there for me through all of this! i dont know how i could be getting through this w/o you!!! i luv you and thank you! you dont know what you all mean to me!!!"

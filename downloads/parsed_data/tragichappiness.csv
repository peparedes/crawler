It's the worst feeling even imaginable besides the feeling of being negleted which is another feeling I am feeling deep inside
This torment and mutilation I am putting myself through sucks
I don't wanna go through it anymore
I just want to get out of this house and find what I am looking for
My mind is filled with all these thoughts but all of them seem to be about you
Then there is the thought of why I even think about you so much
I mean, whats the point of thinking about you when all it does is hurt me inside?
I don't understand life
I don't understand why after we are born, we get old, we die and then we don't exsist anymore
Why does that happen?
I'm sick of feeling like shit all the time
I feel like I am here just for people to have their fun with me, then after that they want nothing to do with me
Another thing I don't get is, how can people like you one minute but not the next? All the people I've ever liked I've never gotten totally over them
People are fucking hypocritical assholes and need to be shot

Self Mutilation is the key to endless unliving and to everything not worth living for.
In concluding that statement, LIFE SUCKS!!! 

This is the HATE poem......

I hate that you're not here with me right now when I feel like I need you the most
I hate that I love you
I hate that I can't feel you
I hate that I can't smell or taste you
I hate that you don't feel the same way and that you just think of me as a ""friend""
I hate that I hate so many things about you, But I love the person I see inside of the body I see
Everytime I look for comfort, I think of you
Everytime I'm happy, I think of you
Everytime I see you, I miss you more
There's just no winning with you

That's my poem that I wrote like 2 months ago haha"

He is more rocky than the other one - Mike (who is more pop). I prefer Rock (well I'm not a rocker, actually I listen to Punk but in this case I prefer Rock *lol*) and that's why I want Tobias to win. 
Greeeeeets at all

It was like every other school day: on the one hand kinda stupid because of having to get up very early but on the other hand I liked it cause we went bowling in the sports lessons *yeah*
Last night we got 15cm fresh snow and when I pulled back my curtain this morning I was like ""Wow, snow!"". I never expected that it would snow, I mean meteorologically seen it's the first day of spring today but I couldn't care less!
I'll go for lunch now and after that I'll do my homework. I'll be back online this evening!

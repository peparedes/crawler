"event","Well this is a strange thought to have in the middle of the night. I just had to write about it, even though I know I haven't written in months now. It just hit me as I was lying in bed thinking to myself about various things while trying to go to sleep that I am TWENTY. It's so strange even now to say it!! I know I actually am 20, and that I shouldn't be surprised by that fact. I've lived 20 years now, I remember them all. Okay, maybe not the first two or three. I feel like I have the mindset of a teenager still, like maybe 16 or 17, really. Maybe it's on account of those first few years that I don't remember. That's it. I feel like a teenager, because cognitively I still am. Actually, now that I come to think of it, I do remember from Psychology that you technically remain in the teenage ""state"" until you're around 24. So I have a few years to grow up. But in my mind I'm 17, even though my body and papers say that I'm 20. Oh well. Life continues, you can't stop it..."

"event","This week, from Monday afternoon until Thursday afternoon I went with my church to the biggest conference of Christian college students in the United States: Passion '06. 
So what can I say? It was incredible, as usual. The people who led the music/worship time were the David Crowder Band, Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman, and a somewhat new artist, Christian Stanfield (I may have his last name wrong, but if I do, I'll come back and correct it.) The main speakers of this event included Louie Giglio, Beth Moore, and John Piper. The music was awesome, the speakers were great, and the atmosphere was incredible. Besides the fact that excitement is simply contagious when you are around 18,000 screaming fans, it's something quite different to be in the midst of 18,000 fans of THE Famous One. Chris Tomlin has a new song called ""Party,"" actually inspired by a Big & Rich concert that he saw at the CMA's. He was in the midst of thousands of fans of Big & Rich who were partying their brains out and having tons of fun, but realized that we have a Much bigger reason to party. Of course the song includes the word ""party"" and ""we're gonna party"" over and over, but the thing it rejoices is stated in the line ""We have already won."" 
We HAVE already won, and we have more of a reason to party than anyone on the face of the earth if we know Christ and belong to Him. 
Louie Giglio also did a great job of showing us just how small we really are. He showed us pictures of our earth, solar system, our galaxy, other galaxies, and finally, the cross. The thoughts that remain in my mind after seeing and hearing that message is not only how itty bitty I am compared to the massive universe God created and holds in His hand, but the fact that he loves us silly, itty bitty creatures He created, so much that He'd become one of us silly, itty bitty creatures that He created and placed on this speck of dust in a sunbeam and not only that but to be killed by us only to save us. There aren't words. 
Though I'm sure everyone who reads this who wasn't there will think right away that it sounds like some religious high experience that everyone gets the same feelings every time they go to one of these things, and they think I'm just going to sit here and say ""well this was different."" I'm not going to say that. It was bigger yes, and more exciting, yes. But no different. It's the same God we go and experience every time we go to one of these ""revivals"" of sorts. He's the same forever, and so will these things be, but truly encountering the God of creation and continuing in that intense, passionate relationship that is different from encountering some of your own intense passionate feelings that come from nowhere and are for no one. 
God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and He is to be forever praised!

"event","Tomorrow I will have officially been home for Christmas break a week! It's kind of sad, really... thinking about how fast it's going... but at the same time I love being up at school minus the classes. 
So what have I done since I've been home you ask? Let's see... last Tuesday I went shopping with my mom and did a bunch of Christmasy stuff like wrapping gifts. Wednesday I started my new job, which is going really well, it's fairly boring, but pays REALLY well. Everyone is extremely nice, which is a great bonus. Besides work not much has been going on, it really wears me out every day, and I'm only doing 6 hours, I can't imagine a full 8 every day. 
Saturday my mamaw and I went shopping and I got a BUNCH of clothes for Christmas. What can I say, I'm a bargain shopper. Then that afternoon my dad and I went on a walk that lasted about an hour and a half that took us from walmart, to underneath the interstate, to a place called Camp Jordan (I swear I'm not making this up if you're reading this and not from Chattanooga), to alongside a river where we talked about the Indians that used to live in that area, the civil war, the missionaries that settled there and witnessed to the Indians, it was a pretty neat day :-) I love nature and I love my dad. Going on those kinds of walks are the best and irreplaceable. Oh, I can't leave this out; after all those conversations along the river bank, when we went back through camp Jordan talked about the Simpsons. For quite a while actually. The intellectual benefits of the Simpsons to be precise, lol.  It wasn't too cold Saturday, either. I just wore a sweatshirt with a hoodie which actually blocked my perifferal vision and almost walked into a biker. 
Then Saturday night I hung out with two of my best friends and went to see King Kong. Good movie, but I'm not about to give a review on here, I need to go to bed soon. 
And finally, today... I had it all planned out in my head... I went to bed at 1am after SNL, setting my alarm for 8:30 to go to Sunday School then later church, and planning on a  nice long nap after the service. However, my plans were changed when I was awakened this morning at 6:45 by my mother telling my brother had backed out on taking my Mamaw to Alabama for the day and that I would have to instead. This meaning that I wouldn't get my 7 1/2 hours of sleep plus the nap I was planning on (it ended up being less than 6), in addition driving 4 hours total today. I'm not complaining, no, the day was great, I just wish I had been prepared. Sleep is one of the most important things in my life at this point. It'll be bumped down one day when I have kids, a husband, and a steady job one day, but for right now, it's pretty much top 5. 
Good night everyone!"

""LISTEN! I am telling you a mystery:
We will not all fall asleep,

For the trumpet will sound,

Incorruptible,

Because this corruptible

with immortality.
Now when this corruptible

and this mortal is clothed 
with immortality,
then the saying that is written
will take place:
Death has been
swallowed up in victory.
O Death, where is your victory?
O Death, where is your sting?
Now the sting of death is sin,

"event","I know it's a little late in coming, but I wanted to write about my weekend. :-)
I got to go home this weekend for the first time in over a month! It was so much fun! Since I hadn't been home in so long, all I wanted to do this weekend was hang out with my family. I love my friends at home, but I've just been so busy at school lately all I wanted to do was have some down time with my family. 
So I got home Friday night and we went out to dinner to celebrate my dad's birthday which was a week ago today (He's 49! holy cow!). It was my parents, my mammaw, my brother, sister in law, and me. Texas Roadhouse. YUM! So that's about it for Friday night, lol, I just came back home, hung out with the family for a little while, recorded the Friday night standup on CC of Brian Regan, and went to bed! I love bed.
So Saturday, I got my hair did! You can't tell can you? It's okay, that's the whole point, I had roots I didn't want anyone to notice. But you know now so it doesn't matter! Then I went to lunch with my friend Alexandra, who may be coming up here this weekend, yay!! Then came home, went on a walk with my daddy around the riverwalk. Then ate corn dogs... went to Payless and Blockbuster with my mom, and ended the day off with a viewing of Sahara... I didn't like it too much, sorry :-/ 
So Sunday. Sunday was GREAT! I had a blast at church! I hadn't been to my home church in probably two months because the last time I was home I didn't go b/c I slept in :( It was nice because I sat with my family (I don't normally, isn't that terrible?) and the pastor's sermon was great. Then I went to Sunday School and EVERYONE I saw there I was SO happy to see! And they were all happy to see me too which made it even better! Plus the Sunday School lesson was great and I'm hopefully going to get to go to Passion again this year! Yay! 
It's funny... God knows exactly what's going to cheer me up. I love it. This weekend did cheer me up, it gave me such confidence in my friends and my home church, and inspired me as well. It was so inspiring to see that the growth and friendships that were started last January during our Passion trip to Nashville were still going strong. It's amazing, and God is so good."

"event","""The result of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever."" Isaiah 32:17. 

It's funny how you know what it is that will make you happy, yet sometimes, you don't do it. When you get out of the habit of doing those things, your mind starts to convince you that maybe those things didn't really make you happy. Lately I have struggled a bit with peace, with inner confidence and with happiness, and I didn't do anything about it. Of course I wanted it, and I knew exactly what it was that was effecting my moods. I wasn't reading my Bible every day. I wasn't praying except to bless my food. I wasn't praying for the people whom I promised I would pray for. I wasn't trusting God, or believing Him, or even acknowledging His holiness. Don't ask me why, I just didn't. I had gotten out of those habits, I wasn't making it a priority to do my quiet time, and now, even though it's only been a day since I've decided to ""change my ways"" and start prioritizing my relationship with God and put my role as Believer above every other role in my life, I already feel peace. God is amazing. It's like how we used to have it explained to us in our youth group... it's you that is walking away from God, and no matter how many steps away from Him you've taken, you only need to take one step back toward Him, and He'll be right there. It's funny how even when we don't realize it, God is pursuing us."

"event","This is my second update within the past 15 minutes, but I'm not going to not post just because of that. For some reason lately what has been on my mind is my friend Asher. Many probably didn't read the blog about it I wrote this summer, but he is the younger brother of one of my old friends Hadrienne who fell from 38 1/2 feet inside an abandoned building this summer. Asher is only 17, and is pretty much a quadrapalegic. He is an artist and a skater. This is nothing he nor anyone else expected, but God knew. I don't know why it happened but most likely since I'm at a fair distance from this situation yet at the same time know the people personally that are involved, I know God has a reason. It hurts to think that sometimes you just don't understand. It hurts to think of someone you love hurting. Asher is an amazing person, and so is his entire family. They are one of the most beautiful families I know, they all have this peace about them that you can't help but be attracted to. The dad is the director of a ministry called Widow's harvest, which I volunteered for one semester during my senior year of highschool. There are so many little old Christian ladies praying their hearts out for this family, and I want as many people possible praying for it, so that's what I'm asking for. 
If anyone who reads this would, please visit The Asher Update at http://asher.chattablogs.com/archives/029350.html#comments. If you can, just read the first couple of paragraphs and skim through the rest, it's kind of long, but definitely if you feel led to, read it all. Definitely look at the picture and the words around it. That's my friend Hadrienne. I have never in my life seen her this way. Also read the first comment on the page. It's amazing insight. 
Thanks guys! Please keep praying for the Mendonsa family. 

Sort of a p.s. My quiet time this morning was about knowing God, believing Him, and enjoying Him. The passage I read was about Jesus calming the storm and calling Peter to walk on the water toward Him. The Bible study pointed out that ""Christ did not say, 'Take courage! I am calming the storm. Don't be afraid.' Instead, with the winds still raging, He said, 'Take courage! It is I! Don't be afraid.' He does not always immediately calm the storm, but He is willing to calm His child on the basis of His presence. ""Don't worry! I'm right here! I know the winds are raging and the waves are high, but I am God over both. If I let them continue to swell, it's because I want you to see Me walk on water. This set of prints can be seen only in a storm. I'm in this with you, and I love you more than you'll ever know.' We'll probably never learn to enjoy our storms, but we can learn to enjoy God's presence in the storm!"""

My first real record, yeah,

I was in eighth grade,

I thought he had it coming,
he died of Aids that year.

"event","I meant to edit that post yesterdy afternoon and add to it because I was going to write more on the Seed Company trip to Nashville. I was writing during my computer class and didn't want to get yelled at in front of everyone for ""typing too much."" 
So about the trip... It was so much fun! We stayed at Keith's brother Brent's fiance's apartment, and the boys stayed at Brent's. They're really cool little apartments too. Only freshmen live in dorms there, the rest get to live in the apartments! But on Wednesday we got there in the evening and kind of settled in. We went to a little coffee shop and then to the grocery store then rented a movie, which I fell asleep during because I had only gotten 2 1/2 hours of sleep the night before because of mid-terms. The next day we woke up around 11 and decided to go into Centennial Park in the afternoon, but on the way got in a bit of a fender-bender, which was quite a sad experience. No one was hurt tho, just a little soreness and some seatbelt marks. Which i'm glad for my seatbelt mark, they save lives people! That night at about 5:30 we went to RCA studios to start recording. So many famous people had recorded there back in the day! Including this little Tennessean named uh... let me think... Elvis. So needless to say, it was fun just being there and touching things saying ""I bet Elvis touched this piano!"" But the recording for that night went well, we recorded all the instruments first, then dubbed in some vocals, and we were done for the night at 1:30 am (Central time!). 
The next day... we got up early (the boys DIDNT) and sat around for a while, wanting to go to lunch, and finally went to this taco place surrounded by people with buckets of beer. Then we went to Centennial park and hung out there for a while. Then came back to the apartments just in time for recording again! That day was a day with just finishing touches like a few vocal add-ins and some lead guitaring. Then the mixers went to work and mixed their little hearts out while the band went to dinner at Longhorn and toured downtown Nashville. We left the next day early early early!!! Got back to Jeff city, and then I went and hung out at my dear friend Lindsey's house in Greeneville (Mosheim) Tennessee!!

The normal odd stuff she does are things like laughing at her own jokes, and the laughing isn't a little ""dang I sure just made a stupid joke"" laugh it's more of a ""I just said something really wrong on trial and I'm going to jail for it"" laugh. More like a fit of laughter that just bubbles out of her mouth and then explodes in front of the class and she can't help it. Anyway, it's weird and it happens all the time. <BR>Sometimes, she also has these sudden bursts of anger for very small things, where she normally is very even-tempered. I should probably start keeping a log of those sudden out-bursts of anger, maybe to see if there's a pattern, or a certain day she does them. In the past they've been for things like a guy walking in the middle of a class to ask a question (he actually belonged to the class and she just didn't recognize him) and in the middle of talking about Microsoft Word goes ""Please Leave! This is a classroom!"" Yeah, that happened twice, and she threatened the guy the second time it happened. Then she has outbursted (if you will) at us before for clicking too much on our mouses (mice?). <BR>So the outburst of the day was of the mouse variation. I was checking my email and so was the girl beside me, so I guess we were clicking a little too much because looking in our general direction, she says ""I better not hear ONE MORE mouse click!!!""

"event","I hardly ever write about actual events in my life and usually write about theories or quotes or something cool I heard so I thought I'd write about something that happened. So I went to Amelia Island, Florida this weekend! It was so much fun :-) I got to go with my mom, dad, mammaw, Patrick, brother, and sister-in-law. It was so much fun, for the two full days that we were there all we did from about 10 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon was stay at the beach, which was totally fine by me, I laid out, collected shells, got sand in my bathing suit, and just hung out with family and Patrick. Every night we went to a different restaurant, and they were all really nice. The first one we went to everybody's meal was good except mine cuz I had these nasty sour olives on my salad, which would have been good except for them.... second night I had crab legs (yuuuummmm) then we went to a ""country"" restraunt except it was right by a swamp and had signs everywhere that said ""don't feed the animals"" aka alligators, lol. 
They also had a cute little downtown area, lots of little shops and stuff, right down by the docks where a bunch of boats were held (including a casino boat). The little shops were cute, they had books stores, silly little touristy stores, a celtic shop, an ice cream and fudge place, a coffee place, a bunch of little shops that weren't open every time we went, and the coolest shop with the most random stuff in it called ""Go Fish"" it was supposedly a Christian store, which I thought was really neat b/c I didn't see much ""Christian"" stuff in it except for the T-shirts (Oh by the way, my dad got me a shirt in there that says ""Mustard Seed Company"" on it... I find that very appropriate.) But this shop had the neatest, most random stuff, like okay I can't even describe it, but I got a cute necklace with a huge shell lookin thing on it and Patrick got a wooden monkey for his apartment (speak no evil). See what I mean by random junk? Anyway, I had a lot of fun and hopefully I'll be able to get some pictures from the trip onto my photobucket soon!"

"event","I just wanted to write some good quotes that I've found in two of my books that I've been reading lately. They really don't have anything to do with anything that's going on in my life right now, and I'm not ""sending a message"" to anyone, but I just thought they were really good and applicable. So read on and I hope it inspires you to read the whole book! :-) 



""Once we understand that our future, our blessings, our worth, our reputation, and our success are all in the hands and under the control of a loving God, we can sit back and rest. God's plans for his children are plans of ""hope and not despair."" No longer do we need to pander after the praise of people. People can be for us one day and against us the next; ultimately it doesn't even matter. It's God's judgement of our lives alone that matters.
In keeping our eyes on God and letting his commendation, ""Well done thou good and faithful servant,"" be what we live for, envy will be curbed and compassion will be encouraged. If we are exercising our gifts and concentrating on how to serve God better, we won't have time to envy others' gifts, and the expression of our gifts can itself be a form of celebration- a living out of our gratefulness to God for his blessing.""
-Rebecca Pippert ""A Heart For God"" 

In the book ""The Screwtape letters"" by C.S. Lewis, an older demon is writing to his nephew, a younger demon ""Junior tempter"" as they call him about various topics throughout his letters. (""The Enemy"" is God fyi): 
""Now comes the joke. The Enemy described a married couple as 'one flesh.' He did not say 'A happily married couple,' or 'a couple who married because they were in love,' but you can make the humans ignore that.... humans can can be made to infer the false belief that the blend of affection, fear, and desire which they call ""being in love"" is the only thing that makes marriage either happy or holy. The error is easy to produce because ""being in love"" does very often, in western Europe, precede marriages which are made in obedience to the Enemy's designs, that is, with the intention of fidelity, fertility, and goodwill; just as religious emotion very often, but not always, attends conversion. In other words, the humans are to be encouraged to regard as the basis for marriage a highly coloured and distorted version of something the Enemy really promises as its result... the idea of marrying with any other motive seems to them low and cynical. Yes, they think that. They regard the intention of loyalty to a partnership for mutual help, for the preservation of chastity, and for the transmission of life, as something lower than a storm of emotion. (Don't neglect to make your man think the marriage service very offensive.) In the second place any sexual infatuation whatever, so long as it intends marriage, will be regarded as 'love,' and 'love' will be held to excuse a man from all the guilt, and to protect him from all the consequences, of marrying a heathen, a fool, or a wanton."""

One of the speakers the first night said that if you came for one speaker in particular you were carnal. I was like yep, that's me. Carnal. BUT just like Paul said, how it doesn't matter why someone preaches Christ, it just matters that Christ is preached. In the same way, it doesn't matter why I went, but either way I went, and it was cool. By the way! Coolest women in the WORLD are Janet Parshall and Rebecca Pippert. I LOVE Rebecca Pippert.

*Same original question, a few different words. Are you really a Christian if you have no compassion on others? Has your life meant something if you haven't been compassionate? So then, wouldn't compassion be an essential part in our Christianity? ""The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love... No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God remains in us and His love is perfected in us... If anyone says 'I love God.' yet hates his brother, he is a liar."" Ouch!

This verse was the theme verse for Ocoee Outreach, ""Project Restoration,"" this summer. I really have no idea where I want to begin my entry! I want to write about everything that I've learned this summer, socially, biblically, physically, etc. and I also want to write about the people I've met, the funny stories, the lessons I've learned, crazy/weird experiences, but I honestly have nowhere to begin! 

I had tons of fun this summer is a great place to start! I had a new group every week and each group had a fun personality that was really unique, and I got to meet people from all different states, too, which was cool. My 7 groups this summer were from Barnwell, SC; Big Island, VA; Ellendale (Memphis) TN; Rock Hill, SC; Robertsdale, AL; Palm Coast, FL; and Knoxville, TN. No group was the same, and I miss a whole lot of those people. I think most people know what it feels like to get to go on a trip of some sort and spend every waking moment with a group of people for a week; well, that was my whole summer! I got to go on a two-month long mission trip! And it had all the same effects as the week-long one. I still missed everyone when we had to part, but I had so much fun while it was still going on. My faith grew every week as each time I learned something new and unique about the God I was serving in my own Jerusalem (of sorts) Cleveland, TN. 

That's it for now, because this has been a tiring summer and I'm ready to make up for all the sleep I've missed the past 8 weeks! So goodnight, and don't forget that over 1000 people die a year in toaster accidents."

"event","I have had an amazing week. God has done so much, you wouldn't believe it. I know I promised that I would write every chance I got, but this is actually the only chance I've gotten so far. 
I bonded a lot with the group that I had this past week, they were an awesome bunch of kids. They exemplified Christ to me in unbelievable ways. Unlike most youth groups today, they were unified. God bless them, they were unified. And for some reason they really liked me. But God really used them this week. I really miss them, I feel like I'm missing family. And in a way, I am, a piece of my family of God, definitely. 
Yesterday, Wednesday June 29th, 2005, me and two of the kids from my group went on what we call 2x4's. That's where we go into the surrounding neighborhood of the house that we're working on and knock on doors telling people what we're doing down the street just in case they were wondering. Then, we use that as a jumping off point to bring up our faith, by asking them if there's anything we can pray about for them and with them. That definitely gives us a chance to talk about our faith. Well, the ""witnessing tool"" that we use is a little bracelet, which I'm sure most church going people have seen in VBS or somewhere else, with a clear bead, black bead, red bead, white bead, blue bead, green bead, and yellow bead. Honestly, I didn't have much faith in these little bracelets to lead anyone to Christ, let alone teach them anything. And that's where I was wrong. It wasn't wrong that I didn't have faith in the bracelet, of course, but that I didn't have faith in God to use something as simple as a bracelet. How spectacular of such a complex God to use something as simple as a piece of leather and a few chunks of plastic. (As if the God of the universe COULDN'T do something, right?) 

Julia and Luke were the names of the two kids that I took with me. The day before we went on our 2x4's I took two boys from the group and had really good success in talking to people, everyone was receptive, but aleady saved (praise God, that's why it was successful) and I was very excited about being able to talk so freely for one of the first times in my life about my faith. I had a great day that day. Wedesday started off a little rougher, and I knew that if I was going to be able to talk to anyone and at least have a smile on my face, it was going to be a miracle. So I prayed that God would work despite how I was feeling. Boy, did He. 

When I knocked on the door, a small, older Hispanic lady answered. I asked her how she was doing and she said that she wasn't doing very well; she had cancer and was going to go through surgery soon. The first thing I said to her was ""would you like us to pray with you?"" and she looked a little taken aback. It wasn't the best introduction, but hey, I got at least one embarassing thing out of the way. I told her that we were from Ocoee Outreach and that we came to the neighborhood to pray for people. Good starting off point. Over the next few minutes, kids kept coming to the door. It turned out she was babysitting her cousin's kids. There were four kids in all, a girl, Gaby who looked about 9, a boy Oscar, who looked about 10, Gaby had a white friend named Brittany (from Nashville, how strange?) and there was a baby who looked to be about 1 year old. After praying with them for Rosa's (that was the woman's name, I forgot to mention it already) cancer, I showed them all the witnessing bracelet and explained what each one stood for. After I finished, I asked them if they had ever heard that before. Guess what? They said no. I asked if they liked what they heard. They said yes. I asked if they wanted to pray to receive it. They said yes. I read the prayer aloud and told them to all pray in their hearts. After I read it, I asked them if they had prayed, and they said yes. 

I gave them all of the New Testaments I had with me, which was 4. My roomie Brittnee had come by earlier and brought me some, I didn't have any before. Hm. I also gave them all the bracelets thad I had on me, which came with a piece of paper that explained them, including the one I had been wearing for four weeks, and the one the boy, Luke, was wearing. 

I went back today with some Spanish Bibles and more bracelets, plus I wanted to get some information about them to give to the Baptist Association in Cleveland. It just so happened that though Rosa could speak English, she couldn't read it. One miracle right after another, huh? We only had two of those, so one she hopefully keeps, and the other she hopefully gave to her cousin's family. When I went back today, Rosa was wearing her bracelet. I asked her if she prayed last night. She said yes. I asked her if she had peace, and she said yes. 

I found out today that Rosa is moving to Mexico on Monday, and that her cousin's family is going to Texas for a while tomorrow. God works in mysterious and awesome ways. To everyone who is a Christian, we got some new family members yesterday."

I think I'm nervous because I worry about myself not being the right spiritual leader for people, and actually just the right leader. I can be really confident sometimes and really.... not confident sometimes. I don't really want to worry about it, because I know if I worry about it I won't be the best leader I can be. Tell me not to worry about it! I've been praying about it and I hope everything goes smoothly. 

My first group is actually a group of adults, where as the rest of the summer I'll be having groups of youth. This is good and bad. God worked it out well though, the first week I'll be working with another girl from staff who has her own group at the site we'll be working at, which is very very good because it helps me to see what exactly I need to be doing, so I'm very grateful for that! 

I'm going to try to keep my journal pretty updated during the summer to let people know what God's doing in my life and the lives of all the people I'll be working with this summer. I want to do it every day but I don't know if I'll be able to. I'll really try to do one every few days tho!

"event","Sadly, I forgot to mention some pretty big things that have happened around here recently. When I came back from the conference on Friday I found out that a few bad things had happened. (Doesn't it seem that deaths and bad things happen in three's?)

Well, the first thing my mom told me when I got back concerned one of my friends from highschool. I had a friend in highschool who was actually my best friend in 6th grade and we kind of drifted away, but are still friends, and her name is Hadrienne. Hadrienne has a younger brother named Asher who is a skateboarder, a photographer, and an all around cool, nice kid. The other day Asher was in a building called Parkway Towers in Chattanooga taking pictures, when he stepped back on what he presumed to be solid floor, but when he put down his weight, he fell five stories until he fell on a pile of lumber on the first floor. Miraculously, Asher is still alive. The lumber he landed on saved his life, but at the same time also broke his back. His spine has been crushed in a few places and he has broken a few bones, including his femur which he had surgery on this morning. Asher is in a coma right now, and everyone is hopeful that he will come out of it, though he will be paralyzed from the waist down, a chance still remaining that he could be paralyzed from the neck down. All things concerned, he is doing quite well for his situation. I visited his family today and got to see Hadrienne and talked with her for two hours, and her parents for a few seconds. Meredith and Anna went with me. It was bittersweet, I loved that I got to see Hadrienne, but hated the circumstances it was under. She's doing fine, but her and her family still need prayer as well. Their lives have changed drastically within the past week and will probably be changed forever, so if anyone who reads this would, please say a quick prayer for the Mendonsa family and continue to keep them in your prayers, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, I found out that my pappaw had another stroke. If anyone had come home with me from school or has been to my house that lives in Chattanooga, knows that my grandparents live with us in the basement so that we can help take care of my pappaw. I think if he had a stroke it was mild compared to the other strokes that he's had. The way this one seemed to affect him was that it made him weaker and I think he's speaking out of the side of his mouth a little. So hopefully this hasn't hurt him very much at all. He's at Lifecare of East Ridge right now, so I would also appreciate if he was kept in your prayers! This one is also pretty close to my heart.
 
And finally, my mom also informed me that one of my friends from elementary school was in a car wreck this past week or so and is also going to be paralyzed. I don't know much details on this one, but I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to keep him in prayers! His name is William (affectionately known as Billy Joe) Garvey. 

I appreciate everyone who's taken the time to read this, it definitely means a lot to me, especially since most don't know these people. I know that when bad things such as these happen the only thing and the only one to lean on is God, and He's the only one that can make things better! Thank you for having faith in Him and encouraging me to trust Him more and more everyday."

Friday I went a little stir crazy, trying to find things to keep me occupied, so I took a bath (perk of being at home not in dorm) and went and ran lots of errands.

Yesterday morning for church I went to First Baptist Jefferson City. I didn't think that I would be going there this past Sunday, because the week before I went and honestly, I didn't really enjoy it that much, but I decided to go because I wanted to see the Sunday School which everyone says is really good, and my friend Brittany was playing handbells, so I thought I'd go see her. It must have been a divine intervention because God taught me a little lesson in that service, something I definitely wasn't expecting. (Isn't it neat when God teaches you something that has a little do with the sermon, but definitely teaches you through stuff you thought you already knew? Makes me feel a little stupid at times.) 
The sermon was on Matthew 20, where Jesus tells the parable of the workers in the vineyard, where the owner of the field the workers were working in pays each worker the same, even though some have only been working an hour and others had been working all day. The pastor's main point was that even the people that had been working all day did not deserve the great pay that they received, but were still bitter when the people who worked less received the same. And as I was sitting there and listening, I kept thinking ""So? They SHOULD be mad! They worked hard and long! Those people that worked only a little got WAY too much!"" I played right into the trap of the lesson. The sermon was entitled something along the lines of ""When God's math doesn't add up."" A paraphrase of what the pastor said at one point is: ""God's math is always in favor of us. God gives us much more than what we deserve, but a lot of times we get upset when God gives other people more than they deserve."" 
What sucks is that statement's completely true. And it's completely true about me. I think like that a lot, actually. Very bad, I know. But then God started bringing to mind other scriptures and other examples of this in real life. First, He brought the scripture to my mind that's at the top about running the race. The key phrases are ""let us throw off everything that hinders,"" ""run with perseverance the race marked out for us,"" and ""fix our eyes on Jesus."" I noticed that it never said anything about looking at the other runners. There is another verse that says ""run as if to win the prize."" But it still doesn't say anything about looking at the other runners. You don't compare the other runners to yourself, all you do is run the race you're supposed to be running. Fix your eyes on Jesus, which is the prize, and don't look and compare your life to others' lives. 
I have a perfect example from my swimming days if you will... My coach always told me that I had a real problem with turning my head to look in the other lane and look at the swimmers in the other lanes beside me, and even on down the pool. It was especially bad when I was doing Butterfly because that was MY stroke. At the time I was really good at it, and I definitely didn't want anyone beating me. So I would look over at the girl that would be the closest to me and make sure that she wasn't ahead of me, and if she was, I would think about what I could do to get in front of her. I found out from my coach that I couldn't keep doing this, because if I continually looked at the other girls, it would mess up my breathing pattern and slow me down. HOW TRUE! It definitely helped with my swimming and I'm sure that it would help me with my life if I chose to do it in every other aspect of my life. If I just keep my eyes on Jesus, my ""spiritual breathing pattern"" will not be messed up, and I will not be worried about where other people are in relation to me, and I won't be slowed down! How simple! Thank God for swimming lessons ;-)"

"event","I think I've come upon a great discovery in a book. It's John Piper's book ""When I don't Desire God."" All I knew about this book before I started reading it is that it was about the pursuit of joy, which I heard some about at the Passion conference in January. However, it's been a while since January, and I'm not exactly sure everything he said at the conference completely covered everything in this book. Already I've come across some new information. Especially this statement he keeps repeating, differently each time of course, but that tells us that even in our earnest desires for God, we cannot truly desire joy in God, God is the only one that can supply is with joy in Him. We cannot create joy in God out of thin air, even if we are Christians, God is the only one that is able to do this in us. Which is what makes this a scary doctrine. As much as I try, I can't do anything, I have to wait on God, and ask God for a desire, a joy, in Him. 

So far, I've only made it through the Introduction chapter ""Why I wrote this book"" (Still chapter #1, so it counts!), and I've got an abundance of quotes. What a great resource in one book! He quotes C.S. Lewis about 5 times just in this one chapter. It's got to be a good book if it quotes Lewis. Actually, John Piper reminds me a little of C.S. Lewis. A more modern one, but has the same intellectual thought process as Lewis, which sometimes sounds like thoughts that seem to be flying through your head a mile a minute, sort of like ""Well if this, then this, and if that, then this, so then this must be true.""  And the amazing thing is, with all the rambling, it makes complete sense. It's almost like something that you feel you should have caught on to sometime in life but never did write it down yourself, where you feel as if you've thought that before and you should be the one getting credit. At least that's how I felt. Everything is so clear, and he uses such perfect examples, perhaps it seems as if everything falls so perfectly into place that those new ideas have been there all the time. Almost like an instant mindset change. Incoherent thoughts finally put into words. 

Enough about C.S. Lewis' and John Piper's writing styles. I'll put some quotes on here from this first chapter that already strike me as spectacular. 

""God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."" -A quote I just know will be repeated multiple times within the pages of this book

""Simultaneous with the liberation came the devastation. I was freed to pursue my fullest joy in God without guilt. Indeed, I was commanded to pursue it. Indifference to the pursuit of joy in God would be indifference to the glory of God, and that is sin.""

""Salvation is the awakening of a new taste for God, or it is nothing... Conversion is the creation of new desires, not just new duties; new delights, not just new deeds; new treasures, not just new tasks."" 

And for everyone out there who has taken English 201 and read St. Augustine's Confessions, a quote from C.S. Lewis about that very topic: 
""Pleasures are shafts of glory as it strikes our sensibility.... But aren't there bad, unlawful pleasures? Certainly there are. But in calling them 'bad pleasures' I take it we are using a kind of shorthand. We mean 'pleasures snatched by unlawful acts.' It is the stealing of the apples that is bad, not the sweetness. The sweetness is still a beam from the glory.... I have tried since.... to make every pleasure into a channel of adoration. I don't mean simply by giving thanks for it. One must of course give thanks, but I meant something different... Gratitude exclaims, very properly, 'How good of God to give me this.' Adoration says, 'What must be the quality of that Being whose far-off and momentary coruscations are like this!' One's mind runs back up the sunbeam to the sun.... If this is Hedonism, it is also a somewhat arduous discipline. But it is worth some labour."" 
(I can honestly say that one I've never thought to myself) 

Well I will try to update on my readings from time to time to let everyone know what I'm reading about. I'm sure it'll be exciting, and I'll want to tell everyone, but if it's been a while, someone can come and tell me to talk about it again!"

Or seen heavenly storehouses laiden with snow?
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light?
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?

You are amazing, God.
All powerful, untamable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim:
You are amazing, God.

<P>I wonder if most people know the wonders of the soft Chips Ahoy cookies... Typically, I don't like soft things, I like crunchy things, but soft Chips Ahoy are just wonderful. Especially if you heat them in a microwave for a few seconds, then it's like they're freshly baked. YUM. <BR></P>

<P>I've had quite a busy day today. It was one of those days where you choose to make a list for yourself of things to do, so when you look at your list you get stressed out because you realize that there's no possible way for you to do everything on the list that you made. Out of the ten things on my list, I've gotten five done. That's only half, and the other half that I <EM>haven't</EM> done, well that's pretty much all homework. I really need to do some schoolwork, or else I'm not going to do very well on my finals. I'm actually kind of worried about my grades. Realistically, I don't think I'm doing poorly, but I do worry about things like hidden assignments that the teacher put in the syllabus and I just happened to overlook. Those are my worries, I wonder if they're impractical? </P>

<P>I guess these things aren't necessarily worries, I don't really fret over them unless I'm in a worrying mood. I do, however, have a lot of time to think while I'm on the lifeguard stand. I do watch the people swimming, don't worry, I'm a good guard. But, while watching I do tend to think a lot. Mostly about the stuff that I need to do. I think sitting up on the stand last night for 35ish minutes gave me a lot of time to think of this list that's stressing me out today. Patrick told me I should just take a little notebook up on the stand with me when I think of stuff. In theory, that's a good idea, but I just know I'd get distracted by it and get in trouble somehow. </P>

<P>Well, I'm gonna head off, but I want to start leaving here with a verse or something each time, so here's today's: </P>

<P>Proverbs 19: 2&nbsp; ""It is not good to have zeal without knowledge, nor to be hasty and miss the way."" </P>"

"event","I can't believe it... I gave into peer pressure and wasted about an hour of my morning trying to find icons that I like. I've found three, but have only had time to put two on there, one being Ralph Wigam (from the Simpsons) with his finger up his nose, and the other being a sexy groundhog. Oh, the groundhog. Maybe it's not a groundhog, I don't know, either way... very sexy. I have to go to work today from 3-4:30, lifeguarding yet another child's birthday party. They're not very fun, but it's easy to say they're much more fun than lifeguarding lock-ins. Gah... TOO MANY CHILDREN. 

I haven't had time to have my quiet time today, and I haven't really been dedicated to working on this paper that I REALLY should have been working on all weekend. I didn't know I had to work this weekend until yesterday, which is kind of sad :(. I had a nice evening planned for me and Patrick, I was going to cook dinner (chicken parmesan I might add) and then we were going to play Mario 3 on regular nintendo. 
Honestly, now, nintendo, it may not be the most romantic idea in the world, but wouldn't it be a much more memorable evening spending FUN time with someone than just looking at them all night? (Don't get me wrong, Patrick is very nice to look at...)Geez, I only have a little more time until I have to go to work :(. Have a good day all!

I just have to figure out what to do with the time that I have until my next class. I have until 1 and it's only 10:15 right now. Perhaps practice guitar? Perhaps wash dishes? Perhaps work on a paper? Perhaps watch some movie? Perhaps ALL OF THE ABOVE. I love having time to do whatever I want, but I always end up wasting it. Maybe I'll make a post later as to what I ended up doing. As if anyone cared. But for now, here are some words of wisdom from Miss Jennifer Knapp:

Say won't you say, say that you love me
With love ever love, with love everlasting
All my devotion put into motion by you
Every morning I 
Have the chance to rise and give my all
Every afternoon I find
I have only wasted time in light of your awe
Isn't love amazing? I forgot how to speak
Knowing you are near and I am finally free
Say won't you say, say that you love me
With love ever love, with love everlasting
All my devotion put into motion by you
My eyes fear to close
This reckless letting go is hard to bear
On the edge of all I need
But still I cling to what I see
And what have I there?
Bred my own disaster
Who have I to blame?
All I need is waiting
To be fanned to flame
Say won't you say, say that you love me
With love ever love, with love everlasting
All my devotion put into motion by you
I open up my eyes 
To see you standing there
Oh I can barely breathe
And I can hardly bear 
All the love that I feel for you inside
I hope you feel it now
Some, somehow"

"event","So this must be what the world of Live Journals is like. Seems interesting... I'm kind of surprised at myself for getting one of these things because I really didn't even knew they existed until I came to college and several of my friends had them. I was kind of against them at first because I didn't know if I would feel comfortable sharing personal information on the internet about myself, and also because people tend to get really dramatic when they write about things on the internet because it's so much easier to say something by typing it than by actually saying it out loud. So I'm going to try to make a pact with myself to only say things on here that I could hear myself saying to someone else, or I could read aloud and not feel embarassed about it. 
I guess I'm okay with them now... I honestly don't think that I'm going to be doing very much ""venting"" on here because I have my own source of venting through the typed word, done by a handy program called ""Microsoft Word."" Ah. Good stuff. I used to write in a journal that was one of those notebooks that it was not easy to tear the pages out of because they were sewn in and had the hard cover that was black and white splotchy on the front. But my mom seemed to be able to find them pretty well even though I tried to hide them (under the bed, under the mattress, in my bookshelf mixed with other books, all bad, obvious places not to try). So I started writing in my computer because first of all, it is SO much easier to type than to write and yeah, I know I'm going to contribute to my own obesity sometime in life because I took ""the easy road,"" but honestly, it's just much easier and quicker. You can get your thoughts out as fast as they're going through your brain (sometimes). Then I decided to take my journal and turn it into a prayer journal. It just seemed like the natural step because I was maturing in my walk with Christ, and I needed some way to talk with Him that wasn't ramblings, which is what I tend to do when I pray in my head. So this way, my thoughts came out a little more coherently. Also, if God's able to hear what's in my head when I pray to Him, what makes me think I can write it on a piece of paper and Him not know about it? I might as well be writing TO Him since He knows my every thought anyway, right? 
I'm starting to like the Live Journal thing... I've rambled a LOT so far! This is fun :-) I can't wait for someone to comment on my entries! :::Hint Hint::: Well, that's it for this entry, I have other assorted things I need to get to tonight because I'm a slacker. Hope everyone's having a good day! *comment*cough*comment*"

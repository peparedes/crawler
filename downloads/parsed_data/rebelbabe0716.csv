"event","Ok let me explain. There are these guys at school that like me. Ones name is Chevy and ones name is Bo. I really like Chevy because he is relly sweet to me and I mean the world to him. But, Bo on the toher hand is what I have been looking for since my last break up. He always is hugging and kissing on me and telling me that I am beautiful. I really like that. I mean Chevy id nice, cute, and smart, but it is like he is scared to touch me. The other day I asked him why he doesn't hold my hand and he said because he is afraid that I will get mad at him. I was like Im not going to get mad at everything you do ok. Oh and all the other guys that think they have a chance with me is Justin, Tyler, Charles, John, Timothy, David, and Wodi. Oh and by the way Chevy bought me a car. Thats awsome. ~*~ N/E Ways~*~ I have to go take a shower.....talk more later. :confused:"

"event","Today has been on ok day so far. My baby cousin Matilda stayed with me last night. She is so adorable. She looks just like me so my neighbors call her mini me. lol. We are dressed alike today. She has a little halter top on that ties in the back and her hair in a pony tail to the side and so do I. We look like twins. Well me and chevy are broken up. We was ok until he just missed a day of school and I tried calling him and seeing if he was ok and they always said that he just left or he wasn't there. So I gave up. Then at school he didn't sit by me or talk to me or anything. I guess that means that he doesn't want to be with me anymore. Oh well. There are plenty of other guys out there that are looking for a chance with me. I really did like him though. He is smart, funny, cute, and rich. LOL. And he even gave me a brand new Dodge Stealth. That was great. Noone believed me when I told them so I told em to go ask him. Then they believed me and they was like awsome I wish my boyfriend would give me a car. I can't wait till I get my report card. Mom said if I pass Geometry then I can go get my license the day I find out. I so hope and pray that I passed. I really want my license before I turn 17. All my friends already have theirs and have cars, but I still don't have mine and I can't find a job to get a car. My momma and daddy said that they would buy me my 1st car and then this lady wanted me to watch her kid and they was like oh now that you got a job that means you can buy your own car.I was like what a rip off. Well dad told the lady that I couldn't take the job because she was only going to be paying $70 a week and I had to work from 10:15 am to 7:00pm that was was a total bummer. So now I don't have a job and they can buy me a car. Well G2G eat. ~*~"

"event","My Poem:


Sometimes I sit and think.
Is it really worth it in the end?
The pain, the tears, the heartbreak is it really worth it?
I am suppost to hide what I feel?
Is the pain ever gonna stop?
If I was to die would it matter?
Would anyone care?
Is all that made sense in my life gone?
Does anything have meaning anymore?
The heartache just hits me and I scream inside!
But noone sees it.
I hide what I feel.
I can't express myself.
If I did it wouldn't matter, noone would care!
So now it is tome to find out if it is really worth it in the end.


Brittany

"event","Yesterday was so fun. Me and Shalynn went swimming at my aunts and we had a blast. The plan was to go there and and get a tan. But everytime we would get up on our floats the sun would go away. It made us mad. One time it took me like 5 minutes to get on my float and then she comes over there and flips me off of it. Momma called and said that if it started raining that we could still swim but if it started thundering and lighting then we had to get out. Well aunt Donna came up and she said that it was about to start to storm and we need to get out for a little while. So we decided to go take a shower. Well it stopped raining and the sun came out so we decided to get back in the pool and just float on our floats and not get our whole body wet since we already had a shower. Well it worked at first then the phone started ringing and I was way on the other side of the pool and shalynn was right beside it so I told her to get it. Well she couldn't reach it from her float so she has to get off of it. When she was almost off without getting wet she slipped and went under. She was so mad. She said well I guess I am already wet I can have fun swimming some more. She made me get wet too. lol. We finally got out about 6:30 so we would be dried off a little before we left. She was going to stay the night but her mom wouldn't let her. We would have so much fun. Well g2g. Bye"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666 size=5>Today was an exciting day.&nbsp; I got to stay home from school today because my brother got to because it was May Day at his school and he didnt want to go and I am a spoiled brat so I got to stay home too. I got a bed this morning(because my ex broke my other one). It is really big. It not what I wanted but at least it is something to sleep on. I thought I was going to hate it because I thought I wouldn't bve able to fit my computer or my stereo or my tv in there. But we made it fit so now I like it. I was going to go to the doctor today. I have little red bumps all over me and they are all itchy and stuff. Momma thinks that they are shingles. I have no clue what they are really. I just wish I could stop the itching. Chevy told me the other day that he thinks that I should ride home from school with him from now until school is out. I think that is sweet because he is really shy and thats not the sort of thing shy guys do. He is so nice though. I never would have guessed that me and him would end up talking. But odd things happen. He calls me every day and we talk for along time when he calls. Anyways thats all I have to say for now. Write more later.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","<STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666>Well, today has been an ok day. I went to trade school today with 1st block, and stayed all day b/c my little children graduated and I had to see it. I had lots of fun. One of the little girls there told me that she was going to kidnapp me and take me home with her. LOL. Her name is Haley. Her mom likes me and she felt really bad yesterday because I cried when they left b/c I thought that I wouldn't get to come in 1st block and that I would never see them again. It was so depressing. Like everything else in my life. There is like 6 guys that likes me and I like the one that is in love with someone else. Yeah that's usually how it goes right? Ok there is Chevy, Justin, Tyler, Wodi, Timothy, and David. They are all trashy and nasty except Chevy. He calls me like every day. He is the sweetest. I just don't know if I want to go out with him or not. There is this guy at trade school that I talked to today that is really hott. His name is Bo Ervin. He is really really really hott. I think that me and him would make such a cute couple.... but I have to talk to him more to see what he is like. He flirted with me in the hall it was awsome. He kept taking my balloon and then he kept poking me. lol. Well anyways. Gotta run. Bye</FONT></STRONG>"

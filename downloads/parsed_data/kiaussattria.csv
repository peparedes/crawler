"event","Man, I sat down and thought real hard about why the world sucked and I think I came up with an answer.  I was talking to my boss today and he was saying that he didn't understand why people think that they are entitled to anything, and it hit me. Everyone on this planet thinks that thier individual opinion or life matters, but it doesn't. If everyone stopped living for themselves and thought of the whole picture, whether it was the entire human race or just a body of people, the world would run alot smoother. It doesn't really matter to me, I'm going to kill all of you anyways, but that's just a thought."

They do not realize that I am a one man Armageddon.  I grow stronger everyday, not even Xen could stop me in his current state.  I don't know why I am ranting, I just hate this existence.  It saddens that the human race is mortal, they will not be able to experience my rise as Eternal Emperor, God of the Vampires, they will know the meaning of fear. All of you will. Only those who swear their allegiance to our cause will be spared.  Xen may save you but I won't.  Soon, three new guardians will be awakened and all of Heaven and Hell will tremble."

Oh, and I'm also gonna kill all of you faggots.  You better hope that I don't catch you in public.  Out of the ashes of this world will rise a new order, mine. I will set aside lands and protection for those who are willing to work and learn.  I will destroy all that stands between me and my goals. I will face God and deny him on his throne.

She sat next to me, which made for an interesting bus ride... *wink wink* But the bus ride was great, I was sleepy so Britt sang me to sleep. It was pretty, I love that girl. But, yeah, she sang me a song that she wrote for me. Yeah, Uhmmm.... Santa Monica was nice, the fuggin' arcade wasn't open. It sucked. But yeah, Britt went into the ocean and got sick for a while, but I took care of her. At Little Tokyo, we went to look for the Yao-Han Plaza and the J-Pan Arcade there, but we split up to see who could find it. I found it, mwahahaha.... But yeeaaahhh.... I got a 78 combo on Drop Out, standard, a 26 combo on Sakura, Oni, and a 178 combo on Era, Heavy. It rocked.... We went to China Town and had Chinese food at this place that will sell you an entire pig, cooked and pakaged for $160. Next year, me and Britt are gonna buy one...hehe. Uhmmm.... She bought me a Rouni Kenshin CD which rox and a sword, its cool. Then we went home, and yeah, it was long. But me and Britt had some fun...hehe... Yeah... ^_^

Monday: Britt called me at ten and kinda woke me up, which I actually enjoyed waking up to her voice. But yeah, she went with me to my Grandmas and then yeah.... I'll leave the rest to your imagination...^_^ hehe...."

Lets face it, you dont want to work, and you probly<br>dont have a job.

Youa re kind of lazy, but your<br>if you get a job in what you are passionate<br>about, no one will stop you.  You would be good<br>at foriegn language, art, music, or computers.
You want someoen you can posess and you yourself<br>want to be posessed by them.  You want your<br>most loyal subject to admire you and be totally<br>fascinated and awe by you.  Your dream man<br>would be Aragon from Lord of the Rings, and<br>Ethan from Survivor.  Your dream woman would be<br>Cher from Clueless or Mary Jane Watson from<br>Spiderman.  You would want someone who would<br>make you look good.
You most likely are a Pisces, Taurus, or Virgo. You<br>most likely enjoy collecting wierd stuff and<br>traveling-anything that doesnt involve work,<br>probably video games too.  You most likely<br>enjoy watching medieval or fantasy themed<br>films. You are dating someone who is very<br>beautiful and popular.
You would be good friends with Villians and other<br>Kings. You would date a Star, Social Butterfly,<br>or Villian.  You would not get along with<br>leaders or Dieties.

Your inner element is one of great compassion and<br>love. You are an extremely kind-hearted person<br>who tends to care more about helping others<br>than themselves at times. You gravitate to<br>people who need help or just a shoulder to cry<br>on and you provide them with the support they<br>need. You harbor an intense compassion for<br>others that is truly admirable. You are an<br>incredibly easy-going person who just goes with<br>the flow and tries to be comfortable no matter<br>what. You tend to collect things, little<br>reminders or memories of time gone past. Any<br>career that will allow you to help others in<br>any way is ideal for you. Love is a essential<br>element in your life, and your search for the<br>one and only for you is paramount to all<br>things. The one you choose with have to be<br>loyal, honest, and able to share their emotions<br>with you.<br>
Your greatest strengths are your ability to bond<br>with others and help them through the tough<br>times. Your weaknesses are your tendency to get<br>overly emotional on things and drive those you<br>care about away with your emotional outbursts.<br>Balancing your strengths and weaknesses is<br>crucial for you to achieve balance in your<br>life.<br>
Astrologically, Water is associated with the signs<br>of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. You are most<br>compatible for either love or friendship with<br>another Water Elemental or with an Earth. You<br>are least compatible with a Fire Elemental.<p>
Now that you have an idea of your strengths and<br>weaknesses, why don't you put them to the test?<br>If you follow my lead I can take you to a game<br>world where you can explore different sides of<br>yourself and taste real power....<br>

"event","Yeah, some of you do not know who I am... So, I'll tell you...

Rgutayu Daktito, Pre-memory (rough translation): I don't know what happened in this lifetime, but I had something to do with the Moon... This is when I heard a chant that was exactly like the Inkubus Sukkubus song ""Wytches Chant""...I am still pondering this lifetime...

Yakari Lunnum (a Vampire's night): I was born of a pair of vampire possessed humans that lost thier wits and procreated.  This allowed me to be born on two planes, rather than just the physical or the ethereal plane, which gave me theorectical immortality. This immortality was only thoerectical due to the fact that I was able to live forever because my etheic body prevented aging past the age of about 25, and I could only be killed if both my physical and etheric bodies were destroyed at the same time, this meant that you had to kill me and then the spirit of the vampire that was infused in my soul.  If I were physically damaged, I would heal quickly due to my previous life, which I am not aware of completely, and would continue to live no matter how mortal the wound. If my soul were reaved, it would return quickly to my body because of the bond the vampirism had with my body. I was a vampire, not a etheric blob, but a living, breathing, physical vampire. But my parents abandoned me as a sacrifice to be eaten by the demon, Rigattria. Rigattria, also known as the Scourge of the Eastern Plane, saw my potential and took me under his wing as a stepson. He trained me to be fierce and very evil. I would travel the world, destroy all that got in my way or threatened me in anyway, whether it be a threat or not. I roamed far and wide. During the second age, I was on a ship named, the Karithis Barudus where I met Drew for the first time, we exchanged looks and dismissed each other just as quickly, he then destroyed the ship. I got away by swim away quickly before he destroyed it. My cloak sank...I loved this cloak, it gave me the power of the Heavens, Moonlighting...Which allowed me to directly meld with the Moon's energy and become literally invincible. My body was severly damaged by the water, but I survived. I roamed home and rested for a few years. Then I spread my reign of destruction across the world again. Then Rigattria gave me the soul reaving, Atorgaturiya Monyalun, or Moon Reaver (very roughly translated) this gave me direct control of the Moon, its phases, and orbit. He was owner of the Moon at this time, due to the fact that the Moon god had disappeared for quite some time.  The Moon itself was now mine, which explains why I am so lunar oriented now. But, I never used this. I continued to live my life the same until I met Anondaris, a beautiful girl in a town in northeastern, what is now, Greece. I became infatuated with her, sharing passion and lust with her, which her father, Iyadi, did not like. He became enraged and began to attack me, I retaliated and destroyed the entire village, including Anondaris. I feel to my knees, pondering my existence when Iyadi banished me. At this time I had not learned that Rigattria had been defeated and sealed within my body. SO I stayed between realms for more than 5,000 years. The only way I could be release was to be reborn as a pathetic human, earthbound and all. I still have Rigattria sealed within me, and I plan to release him soon. There's isa brief overview of my past life..."

What the hell? How ironic is that? Should I be fighting for the souls of mankind as my trophy? Yes, but do I believe in that? NO. It doesn't matter to me, the dark elemental within me is above that. It is hilarious. The vampire in me is above that. That is also hilarious. My choices seem to lead me to hilarity at times. And I will never truly ever be divine, which to me is not a bad deal. There are too many rules and regulations that creatures of ""divine"" nature must abide by. Oh well, but I can be divine in the sense that my Moon's energy will purify me soon enough so that I can draw directly off of it and use Lunar energy to live rather than normal etheric energy. That would be awesome, it would be like I was a descendant of the Moon itself. But the problem is, I don't know how to achieve this directly. SO, I'm screwed. But, I'm still working on it nonetheless. Hehe, the reign of light has just begun, and I am at the forefront of this movement...What's my problem? *shrugs* I don't know, and really don't care.

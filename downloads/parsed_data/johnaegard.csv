I remember so much of it with this weird clarity that makes it all feel totally recent.

Didn't we just meet like last month? 

Wasn't it last week that Midge tried to overdose on prescription painkillers?

"event","This is that ""random 25 things"" meme and I'm reposting it from the other place.

This is supposed to be about me, but I guess it came out to be more about other people.

<lj-cut text=""1. The Colonel and I grew up together. We were world-weary even as teenagers, and we spent many nights reminiscing about the good old days, back when Spinal Tap was real and Iceland was fictional."">
1. The Colonel and I grew up together. We were world-weary even as teenagers, and we spent many nights reminiscing about the good old days, back when Spinal Tap was real and Iceland was fictional.

2. Later, when we were grown men with lives and responsibilities, the Colonel and I hiked the Arctic. Before we set out, the Colonel made me swear an solemn oath that I would not, under any circumstances, cremate him.

3. When he succumbed to the cold, I burned his body with gasoline from his snowmobile.

4. Don't judge me.  I invite you to take a corpse and a handy accelerant and go sit on a glacier in the full view of the Northern Lights.  We'll see how far your civilized values take you.

5. The Colonel's boy was so devastated by his father's death that he curbed all the family possessions and fell in with Trash Gnostics.

6. Posing as a Gnostic from a remote monastery, I tailed my surrogate nephew, vowing that he would not be mistreated or swindled.

7. The Trash Gnostics draw energy from the human love contained in discarded things. Their most potent artifact was Buddy, a corduroy-skinned teddy bear they'd dumpster-dived from an orphanage.

8. They denounced me and chased me off when they discovered I could not not power so much as a cool-burning xmas light with Buddy.

9. Afterwards, penniless, I wandered for a time, until I impulsively applied for work with a crew of abattoir berserkers.

10. I still remember that job interview quite well. ""What, would you say, is your weakest quality?"" the pretty young HR girl asked. ""Sometimes I'm not genuine,"" I told her.

11. The was much to like about that gig: the 24/7 speed metal, the ritalin-soaked lumber remnants we chewed on, the night jousts with the golf-cart bandsaws, Bacon Pie Night....

12. ...but after I learned that they were a Tory outfit, and that their raids on other slaughterhouses were really just anti-organization thuggery, I felt my conscience rise. I emptied their bank accounts, sabotaged the machines with sugar, and slipped away in the night.

13. Determined to enjoy my riches before I suffered the berserkers' inevitable revenge, I bought a caboose and spent a glorious summer caboosing around the country.

14. The most prestigious train that one can caboose is the 85mph United Parcel Service super-expresses, the ones that carry the Treasury department's critical infrastructure endorsement. These are preauthorized to run down anyone who grosses less than $286,000 annually.

15. On Labor Day weekend of that year, I pooled the last of my fortune with some other enthusiasts and we leased a transcontinental all-caboose train.

16. What I had envisioned as a grant festival of the like-minded was instead an awkward, lonely disaster. The hobby draws solitary people. Many never emerged from their cabooses, prefering to sit inside and read Facebook.

17. To add insult to injury, our train ran barely seven hundred miles over the whole holiday weekend. I had foolishly promised that everyone would have their fair turn as the True Caboose. To accomplish this, our train had to waste many precious hours shuffling around bleak suburban marshaling yards.

18. Glad to escape the railway, I resumed my academics that fall. My new advisor, the Dame Professor, was a coffee drinker and a delight.  Outside the lab, she was wonderful enough -- sly, sharp-witted, and playfully caustic.  Within the lab, the pure glee that experimental science kindled within her was blindingly apparent -- and contagious.

19. After spending just five minutes in her presence, I knew I would love her forever and that I would rather airdrop a burning supertanker into the last rainforest than risk her disappointment.

20. I believe these feelings were reciprocal. But alas, her academic career had stunted her somewhat. She could only express herself institutionally, as if the University was her exoskeleton.  She feasted me with grant money and always shielded me from the capricious investigations of the administration.  It was love -- clumsy, poorly-executed love, but love nonetheless.

21. One night, late in fall quarter, she summoned me to her laboratory and told me that she thought I seemed melancholy and lonely, and perhaps lacking something special. As my heart rose and my blood roared in my ears and my mind spawned daydreams of the loving bliss to come, Dame Professor clapped her hands and presented me with my intended.

22. Seeing it, I thought that it could be charitably described as a 'good effort.'

23. Had this observation been spoken out loud, Dame Professor would have suffered an intolerable loss of face. Thinking only of her, I took my intended's hand and did my best to act out the expectations placed upon us.

24. My only consolation during those bleak days -- and I dwelt on this constantly -- was the hope that Dame Professor would someday do more than watch us dispassionately from the window. I tried to subtly invite her, variously turning the blinds open, tying back the curtains, brewing strong, fragrant coffee, and finally leaving a friendly post-it note begging her to join us. She would only observe.

25. On one count, my intended functioned as designed. No matter what combination of lightning bolts and mood tonics had been applied to it -- for Dame Professor was endlessly tinkering -- it sincerely wanted the best for me.

26. After it stepped in front of the poultry euthanization-wand, downswung by a bounty hunter in the pay of the abbatoir berserkers, I mourned it sincerely and left the University.

27. And so, today, being at loose ends personally, with my feelings strangely tangled, my convictions put in question, and my person hunted in earnest, I have signed up for Facebook.

Last night, when I got home from Seth's house at around 11:00 and heard choppers east of me, over Broadway, I knew they were good choppers, looking down on something special.

"event","Apocalyptica was completely awesomelyptica, exceeding my already sky-high expectations.  Their covers were fierce, their originals seductive, their stage antics charming, and they gave us four encores.

And remember back when I asked <A href=""http://johnaegard.livejournal.com/49025.html"">what could be more metal than Priest's double album about Nostradamus?</A>  At the time, I thought it was a rhetorical question, but tonight I got my answer before Apo even took the stage.  We spotted this one kid, standing alone in the middle of the madding pre-show throng, serenely reading a library copy of THE FOREVER WAR, which he held up at eye level to catch what little light there was in the room.

I'm sorry, but even if your parents named you Belial and you like to blow up hospitals while drinking a bitter mix of wine and ash from Jerry Falwell's purloined skull, you are less metal than that kid.  That kid is <i>pure</I>.

I am DMing Keep on the Shadowfell for our gang.  D&D4E is a fun game in general, but Shadowfell is rather dry, with flat NPCs, a next-room-next-monster rhythm, and a general absence of wow.

Here's an example: (SPOILER WARNING) the module includes a spiffy poster-sized battlemap of a dragon tomb dig, complete with a skeletal dragon curled round some treasure.  Very nice stuff.  The associated encounter requires that the party prevent an Orcus cultist from ... <i>retrieving a semi-magical hand mirror that was buried with the dragon?</I>

Zzzzzz.

In my own private Shadowfell, the Big Bad Undead Daddy is digging that dragon skeleton out so he can frikken REASSEMBLE and ANIMATE it into a howling reptile death ghost.  I decided to use this as my troubleshooting encounter, the one I would bust out if the party got into more trouble than it could handle.

Last night, they totally got owned by Irontooth.  But instead of TPKing them, I drugged the four survivors up and sent them to join the involuntary labor force at the bone dig.  Then I told them they had to individually choose between rolling on an escape skill challenge or a sabotage-the-ritual skill challenge.  And they couldn't dither about it, because all the while, the dread cold-lightning radiance of the surrounding abyssal thickets would be leeching away their souls.

(Thanks to John Harper for his cool <a href=""http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008/06/d-4e-how-im-doing-skill-challenges.html"">continuing-damage skill challenge rules</A>)

I think the guys were a bit rattled by Irontooth, because only one of them was tempted to be a hero and try to screw up the ritual.  The rest organized a fast escape into the wilderness.  That night, while they huddled against the spring chill, they saw a blaze of light from the direction of the tomb and heard the unholy shriek of something ancient and terrible being reborn...

Damn, this is fun.  I just hope that no one feels abused.  The Irontooth encounter was rough, and the undead dragon might have looked like me doing a victory lap.  So yeah, next session, puppies."

Instead of a big, frenetic room soaked in howling 60Hz florescents, we got a nice, intimate nightclub with big windows and mostly natural light.  It was very chill and I had more opportunities to visit with readers and fans than I usually do.

On the way down, I thought, ""hey, I'm going to Olympia, I wonder if I'll run into Jackson Tegu from story-games.com?""  And blam, there he was, on stage as the bass half of a drum-and-bass duo that did a short set to start off the con.   Very sophisticated, and a nice touch.  Had a good visit with Jackson after the set and sent him away with some goodies.

Aside from Mr. Tegu, the highlight of the show was meeting Terrence Nowicki, a fiercely goddamn talented political cartoonist -- he's sharp, funny, and his line art is badass.  <lj-cut text=""Check his stuff out"">

My own sales were bigger than I anticipated -- 33 CGs and 7 Greeters, which is not bad at all for a $14 table.  I don't know how many attendees there were, but I'd put it somewhere between 100 and 200, including exhibitors.  

I wore the Maiden t-shirt from Monday's show and made at least a couple sales when people came over to talk to me about it.  Lesson: dress in something that will start conversations.

Thanks to Chelsea and her team for a great show -- I'll definitely drop by again next year."

At every great show, a song will leap forward.  I'll be meh about it before the show, but after the show it'll be a new favorite.  The Mountain Goats' Letters from Belgium is like that; so are Nick Cave's Hallelujah and Concrete Blonde's Happy Birthday.  The Iron Maiden version is Revelations:

"event","First, I'm horrendously indebted to Ron Chan, Paul Tobin, and Colleen Coover for squeezing me into Fort Periscope and then listening to my pull my own string over and over and over and over again.  Thanks guys!  I registered today for ECCC 2009 so I won't have to do the embarrassing couchsurfing thing next year.

Greeter sales were 46, exactly the same as at Stumptown.  CG sales fell, though, to 174.  The positive spin is that it's nice to see the relative share of Greeter rising as I figure out how to sell it.  I sealed at least five G sales with a new pitch line: ""It's like if Harry Potter were making minimum wage."" 

I met a few folks who'd purchased G's in the past from me and were keen to see the G3 continuance, so that's awesome.  I also had one all-table sale.  It was a good one, too.  The guy was browsing all my offerings very slowly, and this normally indicates that I've got a nonbuying reader on my hands.  Just as I was about to quote my price list at him&mdash;that's my usual move-along prompt&mdash;he asked softly, ""How much for everything?""

Also had a goddamn near-stampede when three guys who'd picked up Restrooms and Matrimony at ECCC2007 heard the corner of my pitch and rushed over to grab up the rest of the set.  That was unbelievable.  It was like Altamont, though nobody died.  LESSON: I'm starting to get a reputation, so a big, flashy, prominent presence will really help to move product.  I had no flaming loo this time out, due to the space crunch.

Starwatching: sold a Matrimony and a Pirates to Gigi Edgley at the very end.  I gladly would've comped her, but that didn't come through the usual vocal paralysis I get when I try to tell a Farscape actor how much I loved their show.  When she had a bit of trouble locating the final dollar for me, and I was struggling to tell her that she didn't need to pay, her handler immediately swooped in and donated one.  Nice perk, that.

Didn't see JMS, Jamie Bamber, Wil Wheaton, or any of the other celebs around.  Bummer; I wanted to show JMS how I totally ripped the G3 cliffhanger from a Babylon 5 episode.

I did see <lj user=""synabetic""> and I yelled ""STEVEN SAUNDERS"" at him in my best theater voice, but he was being squired around by <lj user=""geekmachine""> and her sweetie (whose LJ handle I am not certain of) and he did not hear.  Steve, I've got product for you!  Send me your snail address and I'll set you up!

Moneywise, the ECCC gross was about 70% of the Stumptown gross.  Since there were 4x as many people at ECCC than at Stumptown, this needs to be thought about:

1) The competition for the fan dollar was super intense.  There are huge names at the show, limited edition prints, sketches to be had, stacks and stacks of collectable toys....  Especially early on Saturday, people were unwilling to commit money before seeing everything.  I gave at least 100 business cards to people who were shortlisting stuff on a first pass through the floor.

2) <lj user=""spanambula""> and I were working the same table.  Typically I get my own space and he sets up with Periscope, and we double our footprint.   This time we were both in with the Scopers.  At a con where we couldn't possibly pitch to everyone, a double presence would've helped immensely.

3) ECCC has a much less indie crowd, more a Spiderman and Batman kind of crowd.  People were there to see their faves, not shop for new things from weird locals.  Especially early on Saturday, the congoers would racewalk down the aisles with their eyes fixed at the level of the name placards that the con had taped to the front of the tables, looking for famous folks.  Lesson: put funny jokes down there.

4) The limited frontage of my Saturday table made it difficult for folks to browse, so I couldn't pitch to as many people as I usually do.  Plus, normally I lay all my CGs out flat so people can look at them without picking them up.  Some people are reluctant to pick stuff up at a con; that's a tiny step towards committing to buy it.  Having browsables out is a great way to get people over that hump.  Only problem is that browsables consume an enormous amount of table space.

I had a full table for my stuff on Sunday and sales increased slightly from Saturday even though the Sunday crowd was at most half of the Saturday one.  LESSON: register early, goddammit.  Which I did today.

By APE, if all goes as planned, my browsables will overwhelm my space, so I'm going to have to build something that'll display browsables above the table -- there was a guy behind us with a very nice PVC pipe framework and curtains that turned his table into a puppet theater. Maybe I'll put something together like that for APE.  Jumbo-size laminated CG gags and selected Greeter panels that fit together like a trailer might be the way to go there, with some kind of arcade-game marquee directly overhead.  Maybe 12V xmas tree lights too.  Call it the Comfort Cathedral or something.

So the spring con season is pretty much over.  I'll be down in Olympia next month for the <A href=""http://www.olympiacomicsfestival.org/"">Oly comics fest</A>, but I don't have to reprint or do anything new for that show, so it'll be very chill.  I need a tiny vacation from comics.  Not a long one, tho -- the G4 script needs to be finished, and from the sound of it I'll have three new projects debuting at APE -- G4, plus another Comfort Guide, plus a minicomic that <lj user=""spanambula""> and I have been talking about for awhile. 

Speaking of artists -- thanks so much to <lj user=""spanambula"">, <lj user=""porkshanks""> and <a href=""http://gypsykat.com/"">Kat the Greeter Artist</A> for working on my stuff.  I really really really love selling comics at conventions, and without you guys none of this would've happened at all."

How awesome is <lj user=""porkshanks"">'s stuff?  I must tell a story:

Last Novemberish I'd settled on commissioning something from her for V's xmas gift.  

She and I had dinner together and talked about what to do, and I said 'how about something squidlike?"" and she said she had some ideas and sketched some out, and it was good.

Then, like twenty-four hours later, she emails and says that she's not gonna do a squidly idea, she's going to do something else that she knows V will like.  And I have a lot of confidence in her, so I say, sure, go nuts!

A few weeks later, the piece is done and <lj user=""porkshanks""> comes to my birthday party.  She's the first guest to arrive.  V grabs her and drags her to the computer so that she can show V her portfolio.

And damn, the piece that V likes best is the one that I commissioned.  At that very moment, the piece was in <lj user=""porkshanks"">'s cool steampunk travel bag, waiting to be handed over to me.  

And! not only did she figure out the exact piece that would make V happy and then execute it, but she also covered totally gracefully when V saw that it had no price on her portfolio and asked how much for it.  

""uh, it's a commission,"" she said. ""A unique commission."""

"event","264 CGs sold.  Zombies was most popular, with 77.  Office, surprisingly, was the runner-up with 61, beating out Pirates at 59.   My unscientific observation is that people responded more to the office bit in the pitch than the zombie or pirate bit -- people might (finally) be tiring of pirates and zombies.  I got the sense that some folks tuned me out as soon as they heard me say the Z word.  I ended with straight-weird-straight in my pitch -- ""we've got dos n' donts for office workers, pirates, weddings, zombies, restroom users, and the holidays.""

46 Greeters sold.  Final pitch: ""This is my regular comic, it's like Dune in a Wal-Mart, the company breeds the ultimate employee and she turns on them and leads a revolution.  It's a retail revenge fantasy.""   I got a huge bump on Sunday after tacking on the revenge fantasy bit.  Disaffected retail workers go with indie comics like shells with peanuts.

Three big / neatest stories from the show:

a) First Greeter sale was to a guy who told me that his grandmother invented the greeter job as a work project for disabled folks.  ""To Tricia, thanks for inventing my comic!"" I signed her copies.

b) I got invited to pitch stories to a really interesting webisode series.  Very intriguing proposal.  Shouldn't say more because these things are always very fragile, and I've never even written for TV anyway.  But yeah, intriguing.

c) Late in the day on Sunday, I met some intense and cool folks who were really really interested in my stuff -- way more curious than your normal purchaser.  They'd already CGed up at <lj user=""spanambula"">'s table, but they also dug the Greeter pitch and shelled out for the set of those from me.  Then they got into the questions, about what my role in the work was, and I explained that I was just the writer and publisher, they said ""oh, you guys work as a team, that's fine!"" as if I hadn't just disqualified myself from something.

I finally worked out that they were editors who were scouting for illustrators for their honest-to-God Real Bigass Fiction Publishing House That You've Heard Of, and they were totally taken with the CG art.

Book editors????  At my table?  I tried to be cool as I totally busted out my 2005-vintage elevator pitch for The World of Deeds.  (""It's Treasure Island meets Heart of Darkness!"")  That didn't seem to rock their world, tho I should follow up in email, because maybe Greeter did.  But my long-term idea about backdooring into the book biz suddenly seemed.... feasible.

Here's some Javascript that will automatically output a tiff that is to ka-blam.com's specs. It does the following stuff:
<ol><li>hides any layers that have NOEXPORT in their names (I use this to automatically turn off the ka-blam template)</li>
<li>sets the compression to LZW and turns off layer output</li>
<li>aborts with an error if the dimensions are not 3150x2100</li>
<li>aborts with an error if the color mode is not RGB</li>

<li>saves out a tiff as a copy in the same directory as the original file</li>
<li>restores the visibility of any NOEXPORT layers it hid</li></ol>
You can save it off and run it by selecting File &gt; Scripts &gt; Browse and selecting it. On CS3, you can drop it in the presets/scripts directory and it'll appear in the Scripts submenu automatically next time you restart PS.

<A href=""http://greeter.wikispaces.com/g3ToDo"">This is how I track them all for Greeter.</A>  (Warning: that is possibly the most boring link in the universe, but I'm in a sharing mood, so here you go.)  And those are just the assembly details -- what we have to do after all the art and lettering and so forth are done so that our printer will print us something that's not shredder bait.

The previous wiki node is a lot fatter than it was before last night, due to the latest inevitable last-minute crisis.  This crisis requires a quick backgrounder to understand fully:

When you're making stuff that will be printed and then cut to some custom size, you're not supposed to put any really meaningful content -- like lettering -- near the edge of the page.  This is because you can't tell exactly where the paper will get cut and you don't want to lose anything critical.  The exact size of this paper DMZ differs from printer to printer, but I laid everything out assuming we'd need about 1/4"" of it.

Alas, our printer appears to have little confidence in the precision of their equipment* and they have changed their layout recommendations.  They now ask for a monstrous 3/4"" of DMZ on the vertical edges and 5/16"" on the horizontal edges.  This, I discovered last night.  What this means is that any lettering that's close to the edge has to be at least shuffled or at most rewritten to fit into the new smaller area.  So last night I had to start relettering everything that was close to the edge.  Gah.  This is gonna push us out at least a day.
  Making Stumptown with G3 will need some luck and some hustle and no more surprises."

"event","I have often posted here about how nice it is to work on creator-owned stuff.  I have to admit, though, that here at Greeter HQ we are focused on more than glorious revolution and establishment-smashing.

We have to play in the marketplace too.  We compete with every comic out there.  We don't want to be some niche thing that only ten weird people read.  This means that we must selectively embrace the conventions of the genre.  

In comics, that means skin.

I want to assure our readers that we looked deep inside ourselves before committing to this path and that we hope that they don't feel like we've betrayed their trust.  But regardless of how that little inner conversation shakes out, the fact remains that Greeter #3 will have not one but <B>two nude scenes.</B>  

The first takes its cue from <A href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0765443/"">Eastern Promises</A>. <lj-cut text=""Here, our dashing Alien Store Captain is letting his Viggo Mortensen fly while improvising his way out of a situation that's gone a bit... pear-shaped."">Here, our dashing Alien Store Captain is letting his Viggo Mortensen fly while improvising his way out of a situation that's gone a bit... pear-shaped.

He's normally much more circumspect and modest -- here he is in his walkaround clothes:

Our second scene is a bit more conventional.  To be honest, I was so taken with the Space Invaders bathmat (<b>edit:</b> actually, it's tiling) that I totally didn't notice Tim's lack of clothes here:

"event","Got some good Greeter work saved off this weekend.

My goal was to finish all the screen art for G3 -- there are a lot of computer screens in the thing, and we don't want them to be blank.  Since I am not the fastest Illustrator user in the world, I decided that all the screens on P22 were getting the same art.  On P22, the store is having a bit of a conniption fit as it deals with a problem that is not in its standard operating manual.  Hopefully this repetition evokes computer system panic rather than creative team laziness.

But despite that bit of laziness, the screen art was still crazy painstaking work.  It was like something Mr. Miyagi would have made the Karate Kid do, if the Karate Kid needed to learn Illustrator to be bully-proof.

<lj-cut text=""Here is the seemingly-modest sum total of my Saturday output:"">Here is the seemingly-modest sum total of my Saturday output.  First, I started with this classic Star Trek image:

<image src=""http://www.johnzo.com/images/lj/khan-red.jpg"">

(<lj user=""chefchopper""> will be happy to know that this was the first hit on Google Images for ""condition red.""  Go Internet!)

I then took a couple of hours to put a stinging insect spin on it:

<image src=""http://www.johnzo.com/images/lj/condition-red.png"">

And then I pasted it, perspectivized it, and clipped it -- twenty-three times:

<image src=""http://www.johnzo.com/images/lj/G3P22.jpg"">

The clipping was the real nightmare part.  If you look at the bottom, where the one guy has cut the other guy's phone cable, you'll see that the ALERT sits behind the foreground figures.  The inks are not transparent, so to do this, I have to painstakingly cut holes in the art that allow the screens to shine through.  Twenty-three times.

Tomorrow I have to design a couple magazine covers.  Wish me luck.

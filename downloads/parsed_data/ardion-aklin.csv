My boyfriend is freaking out, being all I don't know, clingy. Maybe just...over-enthusiastic. He's talking about the future and this and that and I'm freaking out. So we had a 'talk'...lol, that sounds scary. I had to explain that I don't think long term and that I don't expect anything serious from the relationship.  Eek, not so good...for him. We haven't properly spoken since then, but I'm seeing him torrow, so we'll see.

I found this really cool BJT RPG, it's so cool! Ebony: Reality is an Illusion
don't know how to do the link thing, so if you want to find it...well, find it, lol.
Anyway, holidays are actually being pretty good to me. I am finally catching up on all that sleep I lost duing exams, lol. Better yet, I'm getting out of the house...yay.
Almost sleepy time...

"event","Hey, 
You know when I first joined LJ, I was kinda ... apprehensive about it all. But after reading some entries, I am amazed to no end. Really. All sorts of things are spilled out and people just accept it. That was probably the thing that shocked me the most. I mean, on the news, magazines, everywhere, all you hear is that human beings have no tolerance. And you see it everywhere. One of my friends gets teased cuz she's Greek. I mean, her accent is gorgeous, and it's not at all that heavy. It's not like you can't understand her. And she gets better marks in English than most people, even though it's her second language. And yet people insist on teasing her. It's so stupid! It annoys the hell outta me! 
Yet everything here just gets...sorta....sucked in. Like no oil and water. It all mixes, no matter what. But I guess it makes sense. It's less confronting than talking to someone you actually know...
But yeah, I just had to get that out...hmmmmmm
So, although it sounds stupid, I'd just like to say thanks to everyone who reads anything an everything and who accepts it and all that. So yeah, thanks.

8 weeks of doing nothing, until my mum decides that we need to spring clean, again, lol.
Anyone got any anythings that may be of major interest on LJ?"

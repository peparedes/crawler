 dan brought me pie because i was crying on the phone with my mom. he said pie makes things better, but i just wanted to throw it all up....it was a nice gesture though.

 why cant he just let go? is it bad to wish he would die instead of suffer? i feel so fucking overwhelmed with school and my relationship and my family and him. 

 i dont understand peoples' reasoning for doing the things they do, but i guess i dont understand my own. why am i so angry? why am i a lot of things i hate...im everything i hate. i think i want to be alone, i think i miss having parents. 
 i just want to cry to him, i just dont know how. i can feel myself holding in my tears in. its like i cant cry or something, but it literally hurts not to,
 
 today i smelt the warm fragrance of my childhood, i wanted to cry just thinking of how things used to be with everyone. i find it strange how certain smells make you feel and think.
 
 i hope he goes in his sleep and in no pain.

 i felt bad leaving town though. while i was enjoying the rays of the sun upon my back, my popa is lying in his bed just decaying away. the doctors said he'll never go home if he makes it and if anything happens it will be in the next few days.

Let me take this awkward saw
And run it against your thighs
Cut some flesh away
I'll carry this piece of you with me
Because all I can say tonight
is that I hate you
But it would be all right
If we could see each other sometime
If I could somehow make you mine
And if not I'll take my rusty spoons
And dig out your blue eyes
I'll swallow them down to my colon
They're gonna burn like hell tonight
Because you're beautiful
Just not on the inside
Light comes from within
And your beaming eyes don't seem so bright
My heart is on the floor
Why don't you step on it?
When I think of all the things you've done
Boardwalks and breaking waves
Made our Saturdays
I'd buy you lemonade right now
if you were here
But then I'd throw it in your face
And I'd listen to you cry
And I'd remember how I miss
our nights under ocean skies
You and I are like when fire
and the ocean floor collide."

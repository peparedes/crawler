"event","Elly and Ryan, two of my friends from back when I played the Realm Online, came through Chicago this weekend and crashed on my futon. I had such a lot of fun hanging around with them, even moreso than I generally have with the ""real life"" sort of friends.

It's always seemed strange to me to have two largely seperate lives-- the online one and the offline one. Most of my offline friends have very few interests in common with me when you come right down to it, and would be bored out of their minds if I tried to talk with them about things like games and roleplaying and my other super-fun geeky activities.  Whenever I get together with one of my online friends, it's like the floodgates open and I just talk and talk until I'm all talked out.

So Elly, Ryan and I did a lot of talking. We got dim sum down in Chinatown, went to the Lincoln Park Zoo, and saw <i>Hero</i> at the nice theater up in Evanston.  My boyfriend came along, and joined in all the conversations since he's cool like that. Overall, it was one of the best weekends I've had in recent memory, and a nice note to end my summer on. I've temporarily snapped out of my grumpiness, though I'm sure it will be back in full-swing as soon as I have a few days of classes under my belt.

Oh, and those of you who played the Realm will be glad to hear that I made good on my long-standing threat to hug Ryan when I saw him. And he didn't kill me. I win!"

"event","I almost feel like writing again.  For the first time in a few months, there are words tapping against the inside of my skull that want to be let out.

Maybe I'll write tomorrow, if I have time to stop and think for a little while. Friends will be visiting, and my autumn courses begin on Monday. I'll probably end up just staring at a blank screen again for a few minutes, find nothing worthwhile to say but a ""I did this"" (which is a complete waste of time as far as a journal entry is concerned), and then wander off again.

I used to enjoy writing here, especially when I could be funny. I think I'm losing my sense of humor. Where I used to see humor in just about everything, I've started seeing the world as more upsetting than funny. It's becoming hard to laugh things off like I've always done, and I don't like the new severity that has surfaced in me.  I can laugh when I'm with Jeff, but I find it hard with anyone else, and next to impossible when I'm alone. I used to laugh all the time when I was alone.

I'll figure out the root of the malaise eventually, I'm sure. Until then I'll try not to bother anyone with dull and pointless journal entries."

"event","I've been quiet lately. Forgive me.

I just wanted to thank the people who responded to my last post-- both those who posted a comment and a couple of folks who messaged me about it. It means a lot to me to know that I'm not alone in the fears and anxiety that I experience. It's nice to have this kind of outlet; in my day to day life, I'm somewhat stoic most of the time. I have difficulty expressing my emotions, and rarely find the courage to let people see much of what is going on inside my head. It's a relief to be able to write here without having to keep up the facade.

I cleaned things today: scrubbed away at my bathroom until the smells of the cleansers burned at my nose. It still doesn't look clean enough. My apartment is old. The building was built in the 1920s, and I think some of the fixtures in my bathroom are at least that old. While I found the place charming when I first moved in, I'm becoming frustrated by the stained porcelain and the peeling tile.

Jeff wants me to get a place with him. I think that would be nice, but at the same time I'm not sure of the proper protocol for such arrangements, and that worries me. I don't want to mess up our relationship, but at the same time, I wonder if I would be more likely to mess it up by never moving beyond the state we're in right now.  There has to be a time when a bold move, like deciding to live together, is called for, or else people would just date forever, right?

It's probably the smart thing to do. I just wish I wasn't so scared by it."

"event","It is stunningly beautiful outside today. The snow has melted, the sun is shining, and the grass in the park that I can see from my window is surprisingly green. Somebody at Mother Nature Co. missed the memo about it still being February.

One of my best friends, who I have known all the way since high school, lives here in Chicago too. Her mother passed away this month while my friend was at the airport trying to get on a flight home. Now, I am sitting here and wondering, probably for the millionth time, why I am where I am. Grandma has recovered from her stroke, and is fine <i>for now</i>. Dad's cancer is being treated, and he's fighting it, and everything will be fine, we hope-- and at least for now, he's holding his own. But I can't help but think about the fact that my grandmother and my parents won't be around forever, and they are so very far away from where I am.

Every time I leave Hawaii, I say goodbye to my grandma and expect in my gut that I will never see her alive again. It's hard, and I've done it about six times already. 

It's even harder dealing with my Dad's cancer from this distance. To be honest, I'm afraid to even mention it to him, or to ask how he is doing, because I don't want him thinking that I ever worry about him not beating it. I want him to think that I believe in him completely, and that I never doubt his strength, and that I have no fear whatsoever. Consequently, because I don't ask, I can't really know how he is, and I spend all my time worrying about him. I really wish that I was there to see with my own eyes how he is doing.

When I was a kid, I never really experienced homesickness. I could go away to camp or what have you and I was always perfectly all right. I have a bad case of it now, though, and it is made all the more potent by longing not only for the place, but also for the people in the place."

I came out at 53% on <a href=http://www.chuckchamblee.com/dom/fun/yankee_dixie_quiz.htm>this quiz</a>, which puts me ever-so-slightly on the Dixie end of the dialect spectrum.

"event","40 days until baseball season. It's like Lent, only without the fasting.

This is going to be the Cubs year, obviously.  And to ice the cake, there is a chance that my long suffering AL team, the poor Tiggers, may not suck so astronomically this year. The gods of baseball seem to smile upon Pudge, so he will hopefully pull a few more miracles out of thin air like he did over and over for Florida last season.

I gave Kupo and Stubb (the new rats) a bath this morning. I always feel evil about doing that. They look so pitiful when they're wet, and they squeak in a ""WHY?! Why must you TORTURE us so?!"" manner. Then I wrap them up in towels, snuggle them, and feed them yogies until they love me again.

They managed to scratch up my hands pretty nicely while attempting to squirm out of the water. I really need to trim their little nails, but they are still nervous about their new surroundings, so I'm going to hold off a little bit longer. Nail trimming is one of those things that requires a bit of trust on the part of the animal, and I don't think we've quite reached that point yet.

They're calming down slowly. This afternoon, Kupo climbed out of the cage and perched on my shoulder of his own volition. Stubb is still the more timid of the two, but he no longer squeaks when I pick him up.

I'm beginning to worry a little bit about what will happen in a couple of weeks when it is time to introduce them to Stitch and Whiskers. Kupo is very active and busy, much like Whiskers. I anticipate that there may be a bit of a scuffle for dominance between them, especially if Kupo puts on a little weight before then. Whiskers is a shrimp; the only reason why he is the alpha now is because Stitch is too lazy to care about his position in the social hierarchy. Kupo will probably be able to overthrow Whiskers if he puts his mind to it, but I doubt Whiskers would give up his rank without a fight. Then again, I could be wrong; maybe they'll all end up loving each other right away, like when I introduced Whiskers and Stitch to Merry. I guess I'll just need to wait and see."

"event","I was supposed to take a math exam today. The professor forgot to make the test. I'm more than slightly annoyed.

So I arrived home, already verily peeved, and found yet another letter from the RNC in my mailbox. I already told them over the phone that I won't be contributing this year, yet they keep sending me these letters, with their five question surveys to try to give the illusion that they actually care what someone like me, a rogue semi-libertarian among the conservative freakshow, thinks. Ha ha ha.

So I've written them a letter. I shall send it off promptly as soon as I have purchased stamps.

<lj-cut text=""The Letter"">
My dear, though evidently dense, Ms Luther,

As I have already told an RNC telephone fundraiser, I will not be contributing to the party coffers during this election cycle.

I strongly disapprove of the proposed constitutional ammendment to ""defend marriage"", and find it offensive to my sensibilities at nearly every level. Beyond the obvious constitutional flaws in any law designed to defend the ""sanctity"" of any institution (hence, by extension, defining ""sanctity"" and thereby violating the division of church and state), I find such a measure to be morally repugnant and grotesquely irresponsible.

As anyone with even a mediocre grasp of American history could relate to you, ammending the Constitution in order to reflect a ""hot"" issue is rarely a wise idea. At best, it results in the passage of a ridiculous ammendment which is later repealed and causes future generations of students to chuckle at the stupidity and/or bigotry of their forefathers. At worst, it establishes a dangerous precedent, and encourages people to pursue further constitutional ammendments in order to address whatever issue they feel is important at the moment. 

The president's support, stated or implied, of such a measure exhibits either a dangerous lack of knowledge of historical evidence and philosophical arguments that warn against such behavior, or else illustrates a callous disregard for them. I doubt that an Ivy League educated man such as president Bush made it through school without encountering such arguments. Therefore, I take his actions to be nothing more than blatantly irresponsible politicking.

While I still consider myself a Republican, I will not contribute funds to support such behavior. In fact, if the Democrats would field a single candidate with a halfway reliable defense policy, I'd jump ship and vote Democratic for the first time in a presidential election. Unfortunately, the odds of the Democratic party nominating even a vaguely qualified candidate are abysmally low, so I, along with many other Republicans who are not enamored of our party's affinity for ""Christian"" hatespeak, or who have reservations about treating the Constitution with such flippancy, will have no one to vote for at all.

In lieu of better choices, I hereby declare my intention to write in a vote for Barney Bush. While he would be consitutionally excluded from holding the office, respect for that document appears to have waned within the Beltway to such a level that minor obstacles such as age and species could be overlooked.

God bless,

Sara Houle

"event","Well, it appears that I will never be able to give blood again.

The blood people call me all the time to come in and give because I'm type O. I had recently read on the <a href=http://www.goosemoose.com/rfc/index.php>Rats Rule!</a> forums that someone had been turned down to donate blood after they had been bitten by a domestic animal, so I asked about that when they called me today, and yes-- it turns out that if you are bitten by any domestic animal, you are supposed to wait a year before giving blood. This isn't anywhere on the questionaire they give you when you go in, which I find odd considering that more people probably are bitten by animals than go abroad, pierce themselves, or contract HIV. It also seems odd to me since a large number of animals have dry bites that are highly unlikely to pass anything into the bloodstream when they bite. I've been donating this entire while without any knowledge of that restriction at all, and between my pets, the rescue critters, and this entire going-to-be-a-vet thing, I'll never get to give blood again. I mean, I can't even count the number of times I've been bit by animals in the last year. It just happens, you know?

I'm rather sad about it; I like giving blood.

Merry passed away a couple of weeks ago. On Sunday, Jeff and I drove down to Champaign to adopt two new rats who had been transported from <a href=http://www.theindychannel.com/news/2841577/detail.html>Bloomington, Indiana</a> the day before. They're very cute, and are making it somewhat easier to get along without Merry. I still miss him, though; he was my buddy.

So this has turned into another pet entry. Everything seems to revolve around them recently.

Jeff, once again, drove five hours to help me get rats. He also cooked for me the night before. He's so wonderful."

I'm not going to class today. I was supposed to have a test this morning, but it will just need to fricking wait, because I've decided that I can't stand this physical malaise any longer. The pain is too intense; I'm dehydrated, dizzy, and I've barely slept at all for the past several weeks. Even if I went to class this morning, there is no way that I would be able to focus on my exam, and I'd probably walk away with a lousy grade on it as a result.

There must be some sort of medicine that the doctor can put me on to fix my damn digestive track. I can't live with it any more.

I'm also going to show the physician the two odd moles that have recently appeared on my right hip. They've been weighing heavily on my mind since I noticed them for the first time about two weeks ago. They're both irregular in shape and somewhat odd in color, and consequently rather frightening. I'm probably overreacting, but I can't help it. With all the medical problems I have and have had ever since I was a little kid, I can't help but wonder if my body is just waiting for the right moment to turn on me utterly.

I mean, my father has cancer. If my father, who has always been so healthy, has cancer, then what is keeping me from having it? I've been sick since the day that I was born. I've had illnesses that would have killed me if I had been born thirty or forty years earlier. Does that mean that I am living on borrowed time already?

I've become almost disturbingly preoccupied with cancer lately. My dad is fighting his, and in the past seven or eight months, three of my pets have developed tumors. Pippin had to be put to sleep back in the summer due to inoperable tumors in his abdomen. Merry had a tumor removed from his side about a month ago. Song currently has a tumor growing on her head right near the base of her ear. It's in a funny location and she's so little that removing it is not an option, so I'm just waiting until she starts to appear unhappy, and then I'll have her euthanized.

There's been so much of it around me recently that I have developed a sort of cancer paranoia. I've been checking Merry over for new masses every day. I've been wondering ad nauseum if I do my breast self-examinations properly, or if I do them all wrong and could be missing something. And I've been staring at those two moles on my hip and wondering.

I'm also wondering if this means that I am losing my mind. Sometimes it feels as if I am."

"event","I wasn't feeling well today, so I just stayed in bed until now. At first I was studying, and then I started thinking, and thinking led to crying.

I was thinking about <i>my kids</i>-- the kids I taught when I was a teacher. I always referred to them as my kids. Fourteen year olds, many of whom had criminal records considerably longer than their academic records, many of whom ran off after lunch break because they didn't give a damn about school and were only there for the free grub, kids who got in fights, kids who brought weapons to school-- the kind of kids that most of the other teachers referred to as ""bad"". Those were my kids.

I had my ninth graders write out their autobiographies once as a writing exercise. I'd never cried so hard in my life as when I took them home and read them. There were stories about brothers being shot and killed in front of their eyes, suicide attempts, lost parents, the deaths of best friends, the death of baby siblings due to conditions that could have been easily prevented with proper medical care, and about a hundred other little insights that stabbed at me as I read those papers. I knew then that I couldn't keep teaching forever. I couldn't keep facing my colleagues who, day after day after day, would tell me how rotten the kids were, when I <i>knew</i> that they weren't.

I went off on other teachers a few times about that sort of stuff. So many of the other teachers had no idea what was going on in the lives of their students. The principal once made me justify why I had passed a girl who had missed my class ten days. Her mother had died that semester. Her father had sunk into a serious state of depression, her slightly older sister had been drinking, and the girl was trying desperately to keep her head above water. She took the work home with her, did it, and turned it in. I refused to fail her for that. I also refused to fail the kids who missed class because other teachers had a grudge against them and purposely drew them into situations where the student would get suspended. I also refused to sit by with my mouth shut when people would plot to get a certain student expelled. It just disgusted me. 

If we were a suburban school, would we have been trying to find a way to get rid of the kids who cut themselves, or the kids who tried to commit suicide? The problems at our school may have been different in nature, but they had the same root as those problems. We had kids who were hurting in horrible, horrible ways. They were trying to express that. The girl who takes a knife to her wrist is just more acceptable to the hierarchy than the boy in the innercity whose frustration culminates in his throwing his textbook at his teacher's head.

I <i>saw</i> that, but couldn't do a damn thing about it.

I think that my biggest problem is that I love too easily. I love just about everyone in the world unless they give me a direct reason not to love them. I loved all my kids almost to the point of impossibility, but it didn't matter in the end because no matter how much I loved them, I couldn't give them what they really needed, which was more than teaching them about social studies. And it hurt. Every day that I walked into my classroom hurt, because I knew that so many of <i>them</i> were hurting. And there was <i>nothing</i> that I could do.

Those kids in the gangs? They aren't bad. They're suicidal. 

And I'm going back to bed now."

Then I can't study because I'm anxious, and that makes the anxiety worse.

I really wish that I could find a video clip of the little things swimming about and waving their flagella. Maybe then I could justify this love affair with the people who just don't understand me. Alas, I fear that there will always be people who don't understand. Such is the way of love.

Actually, if any of my more talented friends out there could animate that picture so that a flagellum is waving all cutely, I would adore you forever and ever, and probably use it as a user icon with the addition of some text extolling the ever-uber cuteness of the critter. I'd do it myself, but I have no clue how one goes about making an animated image.

I've never been the most flexible person in the world, but it appears that whatever small portion of bendability that I may have built up back in the days of dancing about in high school musicals has been obliterated by six years of not doing a god damn thing that requires bending in unusual ways. I also find myself getting quite tired by the end of class, though not in a gonna-have-an-asthma-attack sort of way. That, at least, is pleasing.

I need to find a way to become more bendy. I need to get stronger too. My partner at class last night spent a good amount of time trying to help me learn how to do a roll, and while I can manage the mechanics of it well enough, trying to muster the force necessary to propel myself all the way around is another matter entirely. My attempts at rolling mostly resulted in my tipping out of the roll midway through and landing with my belly on the mat. Still, I was pleased with myself, seeing as that was probably the first time since kindergarten that I have done anything of that sort while not in the water, and I managed not to break anything.

I've never mentioned my map infatuation before, have I? Well, I love maps. I adore them. I have no justification for it whatsoever, but they've always completely fascinated me. When I was a little kid, I can remember that my favorite book in the entire world was my parents' world atlas. I'd lie on the floor, atlas spread in front of me, and memorize the names of places in Papua New Guinea and the then-U.S.S.R. and Madagascar. I was also obsessed with my family's globe. I used to spin the globe, close my eyes and stick out a finger, then pull out the atlas or the encyclopedia and read about whatever location my finger was touching when the spin ended.

"event","Instead of embarking on one of the many, many tasks that I ought to accomplish this afternoon, I am thinking about Margaret again. Margaret is the protagonist for my <a href=http://www.nanowrimo.org>NaNoWriMo</a> novel, which seems to be straddling the border between chick lit and political satire in this phase of its conception.  Margaret is a young, terribly idealistic, utterly unappreciated staff member in the office of a senator. I'm having such a lot of fun devising a past for her and determining how it would have shaped her. She is a wonderfully flawed character; she only listens selectively to the people around her, she takes herself overly seriously, and she is willing to lie and/or undermine the entire democratic process in order to ""save"" people from themselves. I adore her.

The one problem that I have run up against is how to avoid bringing Margaret's specific political ideals into the story while still portraying how idealistic she is. I don't want the satirical elements of the novel to indict any one location on the political spectrum more than it indicts any other person who thinks in the same terms that Margaret does: namely, that politics is an us-versus-them crusade where the opposite party is the Incarnation of All Things Evil (right behind the New York Yankees, of course).

It's a difficult little situation to wrap my brain around. I hope I'll figure something out before November first."

"event","My Dad came to town this weekend for business, my siblings drove over from Michigan to see us. After Dad flew home on Sunday morning, Jane, David and I just hung out. We watched television, got Thai food, and went shopping.

When we were younger, they always drove me absolutely crazy. Jane and I were polar opposites-- Jane was outgoing and I was shy, Jane was blonde and  I was a brunette, Jane struggled in school while I was an 'A' student, Jane got in heaps of trouble and I slyly talked my way out of trouble. There was only a two and a half year difference between us, so we competed with one another in every way imaginable. I played baseball, and so Jane joined baseball. I played basketball, so Jane joined basketball. Jane started taking tennis, so I picked up tennis. We'd go swimming and spend the entire while seeing who could hold her breath the longest. We'd go to our relatives' houses for holidays, and I'd sing while Jane danced in a now-comical attempt to divert attention from one another, when we ironically complemented each other quite well.

David is five years younger than me. When we were small, five years seemed like a huge difference. I was always more interested in taking care of David than I was in playing with him. I always adored David, but now I realize that in my zeal to help my little brother in any way possible, I was probably pretty darned bossy.  When we moved to Hawaii, the gap between me and David seemed even more pronounced. David was so little that he had no problem adjusting himself to the new culture, dialect, and everything else, while I never became entirely ""local"". There was always a little bit of Michigan left in me, as much as I wanted to just throw it away and start all over. In any case, people in Hawaii used to find it difficult to believe that David and I were even related.

In any event, as I was hanging around with them this Sunday, I kept thinking about what wonderful people my siblings have grown into. They're both just great-- funny, intelligent, educated, polite-- and I feel more comfortable around them than I feel around anyone else in the world. I suppose it makes sense. No matter how different we were as children, we still share more with one another than we share with anybody else. We all went through that move halfway around the world when we were little. We all survived Iolani School. We all grappled with the high expectations of our parents. We watched my Dad grapple with his terribly high expectations for himself. We found ourselves on the mainland for college. We went through the cancer scare with my Mom. We're watching my Dad fight cancer now. We've loved the same people, cried as we said goodbye to the same pets, seen many of the same places, and laughed at the same jokes.

When I was a kid, I often found myself frustratedly wondering why so many of my friends were blessed with small families when I had Jane and David bugging me constantly. Now, I am incredibly glad that I wasn't an only child. I'd be lonely."

"event","It all comes down to tonight. If the Cubs win, they move on to the World Series. If they lose, we'll all be saying, ""just wait until next year!""

Last night, during the eighth inning, the Marlins scored eight runs to move ahead of the Cubs 8-3. It was hard to watch, and by the time the Cubbies finally made a third out, I felt the distinctive urge to vomit. A fan blocked Moises Alou from reaching over into the stands to catch a foul ball. Alex Gonzalez bobbled a grounder that came right at him and that could have been a double play ball. The Marlins scored eight runs, and Wrigley Field went eeriely quiet.

Today, some people are blaming that fan thst got in the way of Moises Alou's catch. Some people are blaming the old curse of the billy goat. Some people are acting as if last night spelled the end for the Red Ivy Cubs, even though there is another game tonight and Kerry Wood is pitching.

I don't blame the fan. 90% of people would have tried to catch that ball. When you see a ball coming at you, you try to catch it-- it is a reaction that has been engrained into many of us since the first day that we stepped onto a tee-ball field. Rather than blaming the fan, I feel bad for him, because he must feel simply <i>awful</i>.

I still believe that the Cubs can win tonight, and even if in the end they don't make it to the World Series, I believe that this year has been a huge accomplishment for the Cubs and a turning point in the history of the franchise. The Cubs are conquering their old demons. They aren't in the play-offs by some odd twist of fate; they are here because they are one of the best teams in baseball. Losing an inning last night does not detract from their being one of the best teams in baseball. If they don't make it to the World Series, they will still be one of the best teams in baseball. Furthermore, if things don't go the Cubbies way tonight, it won't be because the gods are cruel or whatever-- it will be because the Marlins are a fine team and were able to capitalize on a few lucky breaks and turn a couple of little mistakes into some runs. And that's the way that the game is played.

The Cubs have emerged as a great team this season. If we need to go back to the ""wait until next year"" line, it will be said with conviction this time around, because next year the kids that comprise most of the team will be even more composed and experienced, and the Cubs will know what they are capable of from the very start.

That said-- I still think they're gonna win tonight. At several points during the game last night, the cameras wandered over to Kerry Wood as he sat in the dugout. He was watching, completely focused. Talk about a game face. He's ready to take the Marlins down."

More importantly, it is <i>cute</i>.

The other girl in my lab group prepared a slide of <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, observed it, and then swapped spots with me to look at my specimen of <i>Volvox</i>. I bent over her microscope, and much to my delight saw these wonderful little bright-green creatures swimming about in circles as if they were dancing.

Being myself, I squealed, ""oh, so cute!"" and then swiftly added, ""if it's possible to consider algae cute"" when I noticed that the other members of my lab group were looking at me as if I were mad.

Later in the lab session, the professor put another slide with a drop of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> culture up on the projector screen for the entire class to see. It paused in its swimming and lazily twitched one of its flagella from side to side.

"event","I just returned from wandering around the park near Foster Beach. It is warm out, but everything is grey-- the water is grey, the sky is grey, and there is a haze hanging over Lake Michigan that completely obscures the horizon.  Standing on the shore of the lake is like standing on the edge of the world, with what is beyond simply a vast expanse of greyness.

Indian Summer has tricked the clover into blooming. I picked a blossom and reflexively went to tuck it behind my right ear. I stopped, realizing my mistake, and instead tucked it behind my left ear. 

Back home, you wear flowers behind your left ear when you are taken, and the right ear when you are available. I'd spent the better part of ten years as a right ear girl.

It feels strange to be one of the left ear girls."

"event","I love this nightgown. It is pink satin with lace, beads and a tiny ribbon bow edging the neckline. It is quite possibly the most girlish piece of clothing that I own, and I absolutely adore it. I feel like a princess when I wear it-- a silly, girlish princess in a silly, girlish nightgown.

Said nightgown was purchased back in high school when one of my friends in the Girl Scouts put on a Broadway-themed variety show as a part of her Silver Award project. There were two Cadette/Senior Girl Scout troops in my neighborhood. One troop was heavily involved in camping, community service, and the selling of cookies. The other troop was full of crazy theater people. Guess which troop was mine?

I was a Girl Scout all throughout my childhood. When I moved to Hawaii, the Girl Scouts were the first friends I made. I was an uber-scout. I camped, I sang, and I earned so many badges that I couldn't fit any more on my sash. Eventually, I earned my Gold Award. Girl Scouting was nifty as all heck. If I ever have a daughter, I'm going to become a troop leader and mold her into an uber-scout as well.

Oops, digression. I was writing about the variety show and my nightgown, not about my plans to place ridiculous expectations upon my future children. Right. 

Anyway, one of the numbers that I performed was ""I Could Have Danced All Night"" from <i>My Fair Lady</i>, so I needed something lovely and silly to wear whilst waltzing around the stage with a pillow. Pink and satin seemed highly appropriate, and so I purchased my favorite nightgown. We've been together ever since.

That show was too funny, particularly when one of the girls dressed up like a tramp, donned a feather boa, and belted out ""Whatever Lola Wants"" from <i>Damn Yankees</i>. 

We were such good, wholesome little Girl Scouts. It's a good thing that there weren't any representatives of the United Way in attendance, or they probably would have withdrawn their financial support from the entire organization."

"event","Woe is me. I only earned a 34.8 out of 35 on my lab practical. My score in my biology lab currently stands at a 99%, which is one of two As in the class. I probably shouldn't be gloating about being able to academically pwn a bunch of nineteen year old kids, but it is fun-- particularly when most of them got Ds after whining about how easy the course was, how they studied the same things at their high school and how they should have been placed out of the course. It's so damned amusing to see the look on the face of a kid the first time that college kicks their ass. It amused me at Georgetown, and it still amuses me now.

Here's a public service anouncement for all the college-bound kiddies out there:
<ul>
<li>No matter how intelligent you are, college will kick your butt at least once. It's a right of passage. Your level of butt-kickage may vary, but I have never known a single person to make it through college without their academic ego being taken down a notch or two at least once. Fortunately, after surviving said incident, you are able to aspire to whole new levels of pretentious behavior.
<li>Your rank in your high school graduating class means squat, because 99% of people associated with high schools (including not only the students but also your teachers and your administrators) are complete idiots.
<li>Your grades in high school also mean squat. See above.
<li>Very few people at your university will care if you fail. They won't hold your hand. In fact, they're more likely to want to bitch-slap you with an F for the sake of combatting grade inflation.
<li>College is wicked fun despite all this.
</ul>
Remember that kid that I mentioned who asks me heaps of questions and seemed very nervous about his test? He got a C, which was higher than most of the class. Yay for him!

Anyway, I'm happy with my grade thus far.  I am pleased, though not as pleased as I was about the Cubbies' win last night. Go Cubs!

I have these shining kind of moments when my depression seeps away and I feel <i>happy</i>. Then, I get worried about things again, the anxiety becomes unbearable, and I lose it all over again. I wish that I could just cling to the good stuff and discard the bad once and for all, because I really like being happy better than I like being depressed. I like to like myself. The satisfaction is always so fleeting, though, that I find myself wondering when the ground will be swept out from under me even when celebrating those incredible moments.

On an utterly unrelated note, I've come to the conclusion that <a href=http://www.patgreen.com/music/>Pat Green</a> is a wonderful songwriter."

I managed to make it to dinner with Jeff and Robbie, though I only ate about a third of my pasta because my stomach was protesting heartily. It was good to see Robbie again, and we had many good laughs at the expense of several <a href=http://www.ssboards.com>ssboarders</a>. After dinner, Robbie rambled back to the south suburbs, and Jeff and I came back to my apartment and snuggled a bit.

Jeff noticed that Merry was behaving oddly. It turns out that the poor old rat has a terribly swollen hind foot. It's all puffy and red, and really rather disgusting-looking. I put some cortizone cream on it to hopefully reduce the inflammation, but if it has not improved by tomorrow morning, I'll need to call the vet. My pets are the number one source of stress and drama in my life right now. Between Pippin's cancer and death, Whiskers' abscess, and Benjamin's new weight-loss regime, I'm about ready to pull my hair out.  And that isn't even counting the mice, who are a constant source of worry for me. At least the fish are low-maintenance.

Speaking of sources of stress and drama, I have two midterms on Monday. 

Also relating to the subject of potential sources of stress and drama, the Cubs won tonight, and the Astros lost. We're in first place in the division, all alone. It's beginning to seem that ""next year"" may have finally arrived for the Chicago Cubs. I'm keeping the happy thoughts flowing.

I shouldn't be listening to R. Kelly, seeing as he's a disgusting pedophile and all. It's just that this song has a nice memory associated with it, and I can't bring myself to delete it.

During my first year of teaching, my freshmen students were working on a test. I'd sometimes let them listen to music during their tests to help them relax, so I turned on the radio, and <i>The World's Greatest</i> was playing. One of the girls in the class, Asiana, began to quietly sing along with the radio as she worked. She was one of my most challenging students, and usually gave me hell about everything including causing a fuss during exams. Slowly, a number of other voices joined Asiana's, softly and unobtrustively singing those lyrics about confidence in one's abilities as their pencils and pens scribbled away at their history test.

I really hoped that they weren't just singing the words.

Then again, when I'd hear them out in the hall singing songs about oral sex, banging on the bathroom floor, and/or licking people, I always hoped that they <i>were</i> just singing the words.

"event","You might be a big huge geek if <a href=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news/thiswk/today030921.html>the last day of the Galileo Mission</a> makes you cry.

I can remember when Galileo first approached Jupiter. I was still in high school, and the images sent back by the mission stirred my imagination.  I peered through my little backyard telescope at the planet and its moons, which were visible only as tiny spots of light, but I'd imagine that place <a href=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpegMod/PIA00601_modest.jpg>as Galileo was seeing it</a>.

By the time I entered college, I was a Jupiter-nut. My fascination with Jupiter grew as the data being sent back from the Galileo Mission became more and more intriguing. When we were up in the observatory with the astronomy club, if I had my way, the big refractor would always be trained on Jupiter, and I'd be parked behind the eyepiece, watching as the shadows of the Galilean satellites glided across the clouds. It became a running joke among members of the astronomy club-- they'd switch the view to Saturn because they knew that it would irritate me.

My past computers have been named Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede. My current machine is named Amalthea, even though I'm not on a network anymore so I had no reason to give it a name.  I didn't want to break the tradition.
 
<a href=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/index.html>The Galileo Mission home page</a> has been in my favorites folder for at least five years.

In about 16 hours, the mission will be over. There will be no more photographs of cracks dancing across the surface of Europa, of volcanic plumes bursting from the face of Io...

So, I am sad. Then, to make matters worse, the folks at NASA went and wrote this:

<i>""Nearly 393 years ago, Galileo Galilei first turned the newly developed telescope on Jupiter, and spied the four satellites that bear his name; lonely, silent sentinels that began to show proof that Earth was not the center of the universe. Mankind has since dreamed, and schemed, and developed robotic messengers to visit and study our ever more complex surroundings. What more fitting end to the messenger that is also Galileo's namesake, than to find final repose in Jupiter, while overhead circle those four sentinels, no longer lonely, no longer silent. For we were there. We listened to what they had to say, and they spoke volumes. They have become part of our family, our circle of familiar friends. As with all good friendships, they have inspired us to do more, go farther, look closer and deeper. To learn.""</i>

Yes, I'm crying. Not <i>weeping</i>, mind you, but definitely sniffling a little. I'm a geek."

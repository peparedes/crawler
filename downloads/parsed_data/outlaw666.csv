Also saw atreyu, black label society, dragon force (they sucked), norma jean, and system of adown. I would have just gone for disturbed and left though, but the other bands were decent. Oh yeah, and for all you inde/punk rock fans out there I have one thing to say to you FUCK THAT SHIT FUCK THAT SHIT FUCK THAT SHIT"

I am going to try and be out of lcc by the end of 2007 and then be on to grand valley state university, hopefully there, i will be able to continue my schooling and end up majoring in computer sciences. I really feel good about this, and I know if I work hard enough, I can achieve this goal. I really really hope that I can go to that college, there is just something about it, I don't really know, the campus is really nice, and it just seems like there is a good vibe coming from that place. Well, I am going to achieve this goal, and I am not going to let anyone or anything stop me. Well, I guess thats all for now."

He made a whole bunch of prophecys regarding world war two and even things about the end times, and it seems like his predictions are coming true, it is kind of scary, but he predicted hurricane katrina and all the earthquakes that have been happening, and things get alot worse, he talked about the dead rising from their graves, and land appearing off the eastern seaboard in a twinkiling of an eye, and possibly the tilt of the earths axis is changing, it's kind of freaky, but actually very interesting as well."

Then my manager is trying to pull shit, saying that we have to get certain things done, that are just too big to get done without my supervisor there, because i would be the only person doing anything again, because the other asshole feels content to just sit back and do nothing. I am sorry for the rant, i just had to get it off my chest, i think i am going to quit, for real this time. There is some good news, i went to the dentist and got my teeth cleaned, so now they feel squeaky clean ^^. Well as far as this weekend goes, i am only busy friday night, if anyone else is bored and wants to hang out just let me know, just don't say your going to call and then not do it.

Friend kevin is being a complete retard, he is 21 and he was giving thie fifteen year old a back rub, fucking dumb ass is going to get thrown in jail, and when his parents don't bail him out, then he will look to me.

I watched a pretty fucked up movie last night, it was called elephant, it was about these teenagers who shot up their school. That gets me thinking back to colombine shooting, i know it is sad, but the kids who dies might as well have shot themselves, because they pushed those kids that far to do something like that. I am not condoing their actions, but it is sad when the teachers knew what was going on, and yet they did nothing, so in my book, i think the kids got what they had coming. You reap what you sow. Also, some kid is in jail, because they found plans in his locker to shoot up the highschool, but the part the media leaves out is that a few weeks before, the football team sodomized him with a broom handle and the coach didnt even do anyting about it. So, he goes to jail while the other kids go free....tell me something is not wrong there.......well thats all for now i guess."

I am not sure when she is going to get back to her job though because she really needs the money, because she has to have money for the apartment, but i was sure she was ok because she is tough. Oh well, i guess there really isn't lots happening as the title of this entry implies, but what the hell. Got a new game that me and david are in the progress of beating, Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks. It is alot of fun, although the camera angles can become kind of annoying after a while and the graphics arent really anything special for an xbox, but the gameplay is where the game really excels. I am really looking forward to the xbox 360 but i need to reserve a game for it too, i am thinking about reserving elder scrolls four oblivion because it looks AWESOME, the graphics are astounding, and i am hoping that the game play is too. As far as friends go, hanging out with david has been fun, kevin just turned 21 so we finished off a fifth of vodka in one night and got kind of drunk....but not bad. Called dani to tell her that kathy was in the hospital, i left a message but she never called back, i am not sure if she is still grounded though.....oh well, i miss talking to her like we did during the summer.

"event","Well, i think that it is time for a change in my life, i am going to try to start loving people instead of hating them, or at least like them a little bit better. I am not making any promises but i am going to try. I just don't like being hateful all the time, it just hurts, alot. Because then i hurt the ones i love, all my friends and family, and I know they don't like me being full of hate all the time. Well i guess that is all for now, and as of about 4hrs ago i am not smoking anymore."

The Bravery - An Honest Mistake Lyrics 
People
They don't mean a thing to you
They move right through you
Just like your breath
But sometimes
I still think of you
And I just wanted to
Just wanted you to know
My old friend...
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant...

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake

Sometimes
I forget I'm still awake
I f**k up and say these things out loud

My old friend...
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant...

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake

Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake


i only own the bravery lyrics so for any legal things i am just using this song because this is how i feel"

Well tommorow i will be hard at work again so i better go. Also, dani, if you read this, call me, i dont know what time you get out of school, just wondering if you wanted to go c lord of war this weekend, or maybe a different movie.

So i get there at 7 when it is suppose to start, and i dont see any of their cars, so i decide to go inside and have a look around, still nothing, it really sucked. So anyway i came back out and positioned my car where i could see all the entracnes clearly to see if anyone came in, and no one did, so at 7:30 i left, i think they cancelled it but they never called me, wich really pisses me off, because this is the second time they have not called me when something changes, the next time they do it, i am just going to call into work and say i am not going to be able to make it today sorry. Oh well, thats the story of my life i guess, i was going to see if dani wanted to do something on saturday and i called her house and she was working and said she would call me back, but never did. I think her mom might not have let her call me, because her mom is kind of evil that way, but hey what can i do???? Absolutley nothing. Thats all for now."

I hear chimes, and i know that neither of my two neighbors has chimes, and ares arent even out right now, plus the air is dead still. When i smoke the smoke will stop in mid air, it usually dosent matter if there is wind or not, i have only seen smoke completley stop once, and that was when something that was not of this world was near, it sounds stupid and supersticious but it is just really kind of scary. Oh well, i guess thats what i get for looking into voodoo. Well thats all for now. Also to one person out there, i am sorry thats all i can say, i would like to talk to you again.......i am sorry."

Besides we will eventually just forget about eachother and move on with our lives, i think that would be best, i can just fade into obscurity, like i like it.

It is an interesting religion though, but oh well, i just need to stop.I am tired of trying to help people, i am actually sick of it, i want to go back to the way i was before, when i was the only thing that mattered, but it is just too hard not to care,there is just someone that i care about but i just cant stop caring, it just makes things harder on myself but i am getting closer to killing the emotion. Thats probably why i was looking into voodoo because i feel better when i think of death, and quite frankly thats what voodoo comes down to is death, but like i said i need to stop. I need to start looking out for number one....me. I just care too much damn it............care too much. I srry for everyone reading this, i was getting into an argument with my inner demons ^_^.

Talked to dani, and she feels sad, wich makes me sad (i feel sad when my friends are having trouble). Well anyways, i am really sick of work because i asked for one day off work so i could sleep in and leave later for an anime convention, and they said no, thats the black out day because of back to school so they wouldnt give it to me, but my friend ryan is shooting a movie on tuesday next week, so they just earned themselves a call off, so they can have fun without me on tuesday.....take that fuckin cocksuckers......hahahhahahhahahhahahaha(srry i got carried away).

Yesterday was fun because i finally got to see charlie and the chocolate factory with my friend kelly whom i havent seen in a long time. I got her some kick ass speakers for her kick ass computer that her bf got her. The down side to that is i didnt get to sleep until about 3am, wich really sux because i had to wake up at 4:30. Work was good until the end when our district manager showed up unannounced. Then i got a call from someone called them back and said they would call me back later but that still has not happened so i am kind of sick of staying off line waiting for them to call, but i hope that they are having fun whatever they are doing ^_^.

Music by Kenji 
Performed by Kimiko Itoh

Crystal memories
Touched by your voice, in the moonlight

""Nothing lasts."" you said.
But everything still holds meaning in my heart

Hidden deep in my mind
River to the time
That we once shared together-
the pictures are still on the wall and why.
shining smiles, like snow flakes.
all melted and gone away

Only answer was to live. 
and I am still here-
with your memories...

dreaming hopelessly.
holding in my heart
all the flowers you left...

Crystallized moments
Shattered into frozen pieces in my tears

River of moonlight
I hear your voice echoing.
but I'm here, alone...

Crystal melodies
moments so sweet, I remember

""Nothing lasts."" you said. 
Then why is pain still confusing memories

Only time will go on
River has its end
Our light was blown by the wind
My fingers reach out and find no one there
Rainy sky, please tell me my emptiness will be filled

Only answer was to live.
and I am still here-
with your memories...

walking hopelessly.
holding in my eyes
all the colors you left..

broken melodies
No more singing, no more laughing in the sun

River of moonshine
I hear your voice echoing
But I'm still alone...



This song......this song is exactly how i feel it really sux and i know i shouldnt listen to it but oh well, i love it too much."

I have no group to fit in with, i felt like a fourth wheel, they all seemed to have a good time but i was just along for the ride. It hit me on the way back from the mall that i have no one to call my own, i have no place to fit it. There is only one person who i fit in with, my best friend david, we are both wolves looking for our place it seems. It just tears me apart to see everyone has someone else, and they are happy, but i have no one, i am completley alone, i hate it, i dont want to be alone anymore, i dont want to be alone anymore, i dont want to be alone anymore, i hate this feeling, it is so awful, i want only one thing, but it will never happen, because i am not like other people, i have no place, i dont have anyone.........it is so hard not to have a place, i.....just.....dont want to be alone anymore."

I wish i could go to war and get away from all the drama here, over there i would only have to worry about one thing and one thing only, keeping myself alive, not people that i like, not my friends or family, just me. I can't stand it over here any more, friends betraying friends, family members fighting with eachother. I want to go to war, call me insane or stupid, but i need to go to war. I guess this is just the stupid rant of someone who wants to be a part of something important, seeing as i have no one, i wouldnt have anyone to worry about me, besides my family. It just dosent seem that i have been a part of anything big, i want to do my part, i want to fight, and die if necessary. Maybe i will stop taking my meds behind my parents back and then next year join the army, i think that would probably be the best choice, because i am so fucking stupid that i didnt enroll in classes for the fall semester, in the army they pay for at least two years of your college, and you get hands on training, so it's not all fighting and dying. Well i have got to make one last phone call for the night and depending on if anyone picks up, i will be going to bed soon."

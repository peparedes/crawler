thursday i went to the city with my mom my brother joe annella and his mom. we walked around for a while trying to find tickets to a show and then we endede up seeing RENT again. mike and joe were like ow ow when the girls ass was showing i was like omg i dont no them. soo then at inter mission we thought the guys were just going out to smoke... well it turns out that they went into the bar next door. marie was soooo pissed. but they were drinking with the guy that plays angel in the play after he/she died. i was like lucky. so idk my brother was in a good mood and decided to buy me a signed playbill a signed poster and a picture with the guys that play mark and roger. ok well when we were walking back to the train my brother and joe were singing and rapping in the middle of the street. i was like ahhhhhh!!!! ok so we didnt get back to whiteplains till like 12:30 so then i came home and went to bed. 

friday i hung out with erin!!! ahh i hadnt seen her in like forever!!! we were gunna go out but then we were driving past blockbuster and we decided to have a movie night!!! we rented wimbolton, napolian dynomite and lader 49. when we got home and were ready to watch wimbolton... the wrong movie was in the case. so we were bummed. o well we watched napolian dynomite... gosh haha i <33 that movie... then we didnt wanna watch ladder 49. 

saturday i went to long island to rossavelt feild mall. i was spost to meet shanna there but she couldnt go. instead i spent the whole day shopping with my mom. the best thing about it was that she bought me everything that i wanted. sry i no that sounds spoiled. we spent like 2 hours in hollister. i bought like the whole store. i bought like 10 lacoste shirts, 5 juicy outfits. wow 6 pairs of sneakers and 7 pairs of flip flops. the funny thing is that when we were leaving my mom says well come back here for camp shopping and if you want more spring stuff. i was wow i lovee you!!! well i got home and decided to go on the hollister web site and i got 2 more pairs of flip flops 1 more pair of jeans and 5 more shirts. then i was talking to amanda and we bought bought stuff at urban outfitters. wow i did some major shopping. it was fun.

<font face=""Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"" style='color:black; font-size: 10pt;'>
You go to a Dave Matthews Band concert and end up running into people you know from your school.

Half the people in your school mysteriously develop inner-Queens accents during 7th and 8th grade.

Starbucks is a regular stop for you.

You say Abercrombie & Fitch makes you want to puke, yet you sport at least one outfit from the store each week

NYU is your top choice for college.

If you go to Catholic school, you know everyone at all the Catholic schools in Westchester.

If you go to public school you still manage to know everyone at all the Catholic schools in Westchester.

Below 1400 is a ""so-so"" SAT score

You claim to hate your school, but you go to all the dances and play at least one varsity sport anyway.

Even though your best friend lives a stone's throw away, you have most of your conversations with him/her on AOL or AIM.

You know you have to act tough when going to The Galleria, or else you might get shot.

You know you have to act sophisticated when you go to The Westchester, or else you'll get kicked out.

Your summer vacation is most likely one of the following: LBI, Cape May, Wildwood, Seaside Heights, or, more simply ""The Jersey Shore.""

You know someone who knows the girl who starred in ""The Blair Witch Project.""

Your dad works in an office and wears a suit and tie to work every day.

Your mom either works part-time or volunteers, but whatever she does, it's enough to hold a 24-hour a day guilt-trip over you.

If you don't drive, the Metro North train is your best friend, assuming, of course, you're able to avoid the ticket-collector.

A trip into NYC for a day is your idea of ""getting away from it all.""

It pisses you off that your friends from the Bronx call this area ""upstate New York.""

You've met Vanessa Williams at least once.

You complain that the Jefferson Valley Mall is trash, but you find yourself hanging out there every weekend anyway.

You think anyone who lives south of New Jersey is a hick.

Everyone winds up spending Spring Break in the Hamptons.

The students in your school drive nicer cars than the teachers.

Your sixteenth birthday present: Jeep, or your mom's old BMW

Your mother went to a great college, and now does nothing

You say that you are ""just outside the city"" regardless of where you live

Unlike every other area in the New York Metro area, you believe that people from Westchester, ""really don't have accents.""

Somebody had to teach you to do your laundry when you went away to college

You consider anything North of White Plains, ""Upstate""

Your family belongs to a health club, a golf club, and/or a beach club

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Westchester.

ashley<33 this is for you
For all those times you stood by me 
For all the truth that you made me see 
For all the joy you brought to my life 
For all the wrong that you made right 
For every dream you made come true 
For all the love I found in you 
I'll be forever thankful baby 
You're the one who held me up 
Never let me fall 
You're the one who saw me through through it all 


You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 


You gave me wings and made me fly 
You touched my hand I could touch the sky 
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me 
You said no star was out of reach 
You stood by me and I stood tall 
I had your love I had it all 
I'm grateful for each day you gave me 
Maybe I don't know that much 
But I know this much is true 
I was blessed because I was loved by you 


You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 


You were always there for me 
The tender wind that carried me 
A light in the dark shining your love into my life 
You've been my inspiration 
Through the lies you were the truth 
My world is a better place because of you 


You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 

I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 



david <33 this is for you 
I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I want to chase
You're the one I want to hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul

I know that you are something special
To you I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me

[Chorus]

Your beautiful soul, yeah

You might need time to think it over
But I'm just fine moving forward
I'll ease your mind
If you give me the chance
I will never make you cry, c'mon let's try

[Chorus]

Am I crazy for wanting you
Baby do you think you could want me too
I don't waste your time
Do you see things the way I do
I just want to know that you feel it too
There is nothing left to hide

[Chorus 2x]

Your beautiful soul, yeah

for the both of u <33 my 2 loviis
Another turning point
a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist
directs you where to go,
So make the best of this test and don't ask why,
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time,

(chorus)
It's something unpredictable
but in the end it's right
i hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time,
Tattoos and memories of skin on trial
For what it's worth,
it was worth all the while.

(chorus)
It's something unpredictable,
but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

(chorus)
It's something unpredictable,
but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life"

"event","so tomorrow is my birthday, gonna be 22, time sure flys, i feel all old, lol
so this weekend was boring as most are, saw jeepers creepers 2, that was great, ray wise owned that movie, very bad ass character.
got really drunk at this club, danced with a girl, probably looked like a fool cuz it was an alternative club and the only type of dancing i can do is more to the hip-hop vibe, but whatever, got her number, probably wont call her though, just i dunno, dont see anything happening with that, why waste my time, course i do nothing with my time so who knows lol
thats all for now"

"event","god tuesday's fucking suck without buffy/24/the sheild, god give me at least one of them, during the season its like my favorite day of the week, grant it not gonna be anymore buffy, but the was the weakest of the 3, not that it was weak, but u know, nothing on tv can compete with 24 and the shield, season 2 of 24 was the best tv show, ever, better then sopranos, surpassing twin peaks, for one simple reason, keifer sutherland, he probably wont get an emmy, but he was a fucking tour de force for ever episode, cant wait for season 3, just hope fox doesnt push it like they did with the x-files, anyway the -9 spot will be sad without buffy anymore, but oh well, at least spike being on angel gives me a reason to give that show a shot now
um other tv news, season 3 of the dead zone sucks, season 1 was awsome, season 2 was ok, but god, looks like they ran out of ideas, u can only take the concept so far i guess, just waiting for sean patrick flannery to return, anyways, the books is great, and anthony michael hall is doing a great job, and i like the head head on the show, shes hot, damn arent i the loser, talking bout tv shows, lol"

"event","He doesnt get any credit but i think he's a really cool actor, he's one of those christopher walken, ray liotta types, has his own thing and image and look. I really dug secretary, and he has one of the best lines in wolf, and you got sex, lies, and videotapes, 2 days in the valley, stargate, and crash, sure he doesnt have alot of hits or anything, put he's got that blank stare of death he can give, and he always looks like he hasnt slept in days on some sort of drinking binge or something. if they made the book survivor into a movie he wouldnt be bad for the lead.
so James Spader fans come together and rejoyce"

"event","ok so there is this french flick called ""irreversible"" which stars some people and Monica Bellucci, who some may know from Matrix Reloaded and Tears of the Sun (shes beautiful) anyways lot of controversy with it cuz its has this 9 minute rape scene and alot of  violence and stuff. So its fianlly out on dvd and of course i gotta pick it up, not know what to expect, the french can make some good movies, Borther Hood of the Wolf, Wassabi, La Femme Nikita, Luc Besson and Jean Reno both kick ass, anyways Ill just say it lived up to the hype. Its like Memento on acid, starts at the end works its way to the begining, all the violence is in the first act, and the rest of the movie is really just calming down from it, its pretty intense, never saw a movie that sparked emotion and i dunno, felt like i needed a shower after words, lol. Nothing is glorafied, the violence and rape are very real and disturbing, definatly something different."

bought a five dollar urban skirt.
had terriaki chicken with rice and vegetables while sitting outside on a marble block talking to ahmed
so much fun
walked around boston a little
went into this itallian cafe/bar, ahmed had a cappacino and i had a gellato with a shot of expresso around with whipcream on top
again so much fun
walked/talked so more (it was so amazing to see him, it made me realize how much i miss him/some other people, but anywho)
took T home while listening to ipod at around 11, simple yet enjoyable
decided to walk from newton center instead of taing taxi, again simple yet enjoyable considering it twas so nice out
then when i was at about my half way point im suddenly called upon by some car i look around and it's nick max and eric, so they give me a ride the rest of the way home, so nice, yay for the human race and being charitable!

"event","closure is such a joke.  we make up this ""term."" but by trying to achieve this ""idea"" we only stay connected and invovled to what we want space from.  its a vicoius cycle. wanting closure, not getting it, staying invovled trying to receive what we comprehend as closeure, not getting it, still trying....etc etc.  not to mention the fact, that we partially use ""closure"" as an exuse to stay with what we're trying to run from.  subconciously we'll always want to see our ex-s, relive our failures, try again at what we lost at, or at least check up to see if we're winning the unwritten competition. the problem comes, not only from being considered a psycho for torturing ones self and setting ones self up for what everyone recognizes as a fucked up situation, but also when every encounter your left seen as the loser.  the one who couldnt ""move on."" fucking drama drama. i shouldve been a soccer player.

-Don't say who they are, use people only once.
-Tag at least 3 other people who you want to do this. (Max, Cat/Mei May, Mertle) wow three m's

1. you're really talented and i'm often jealous of you, but you don't even appreciate your skills and lately we've grown apart
2. you have a beautiful voice and are a beautiful person, but lately you've been really touchy about random subjects and i don't like this new you
3. you're wonderfully sweet, but i feel like i can't be too real with you because you'd judge me
4. you don't know glad i am that we're friends now but i still haven't quite let you in
5. you've hurt me so much, to the point where i'm dying to hate you, but i still love you
6. you seem really cool, and i wish we were better friends
7. i can't relate to you at all, and the superficial connection that we share isn't enough
8. we're not terribly close, but you're very real with me (unfortunately because of this i often make judgments about you based on stupid actions) and either way i will never open up to you too much
9. you've become a really good friend, and even though you're an asshole sometimes, i wish i was attracted to you enough to have an even closer relationship
10. you're very nice, but our friendship is a fake

that was oddly liberating.........i think i might write entire entries like this in the future (then someone says ""well this was an entry"", to which i respond ""yeah but its different geez!"")

another thing im proud of is that even though i had a fever and fucked up my back fri., no one seemed to notice, and i got a lot of positive critisisms on the performance i did. that makes me happy. something that doesnt make me happy is applying to direct, bu that an entry for another day.
the cast party twas fun. completely sober and completely real. fake people bother me when im down, and the cast party was completely enjoyable. we all just talked until 5, and then the girls until 6. me holl and ariel slept in one akwdly shaped double, i felt majorly like a sardine, but the point is i did sleep. yay
right now however, im deteriarating. physically at least. fever, throat, voice, nose, head, muscles, back = shit. i have a ton of work/tests to do since i barely worked last week. but that just figures. oh luck, how you constantly defile me.
anywho im going to nap, hopefully ill wake up with enough time to write my formal lab, and eng paper, and chinese paper, and math hw, and study for chinese, bio and film. if not. oh well, tis my fate.

ps. i know its bad to be vain andcare about appearences and all, but i think my new haircut has given me some confidence since everyone seems to think it makes me much more attractive. (meaning what was i before?) but whatever. so sorry if i seem to harp o it,or act too confident.  but in general a lot of my confidence is an act, since i act all the time and all....but anywho now even though its based on superficial ideas, im prouder of who i am. and mean people should be like turtles when lying on the back on top of their shells.

the good: i am thoroughly enjoying a cookie right now
the bad: jason and i broke up after a year right after he recieved my super cute happy anniversary present, ironinc, and lonesome again on valentines
the ugly: i need to shower (i pulled the headband look today) which im about to do

"event","today was one of the most stressful days ive had in a long time. it actually gave me and head and stomach ache. i know i make things all dramatic, but even if i do blow things out of proportion the fact is i felt terrible so it doesnt matter whether or not i should have because frankly i did.
i lost all of my notebooks /textboooks (all with the exception of bio). either way i was searching everywhere at home, in school, i was racking my brain to remeber where i mightve left them all. i know no one would steal notebooks and crap but i had no idea where they were and i have 3 tests tomorrow all on material that i had lost. it was awful. later in the day i finally remembered to look in the costume room, and low and behold that's where everything was, but either way omg. i still have a headache. i was so relieved afterwards though. i hate getting backed into a corner, but lucky for my things worked out.

i ended up going to lams for lunch and got beef bun cha (yum) with all my friends (aww) then went to dorys to do hw (blech). so overall my day went well.....i suppose, save for the many hours i felt like screaming my head off and turning turtles onto their backs! 

sidenote: you know when you know theres a problem and when finally it comes up you ""talk"" about it and make so ""as if"" everything will change and get better........and then time passes and you realise nothings changed?......i hate that"

"event","i find that already only two weeks into the shcool year and im slacking off.  i dont take hw seriously and in general im too laid back. i know you need some level of laxness to get through jr yr and maybes its because the had crap hasnt started yet, but frankly i know what i need to do to wise up, but i still dont. i dont know its weird, i feeel like i wont change until something drastic happens and i get a huge slap in the face. but for now i supposei should eitehr change or stop whining about changing because being a dreamer just isnt enough sometimes.
aside from the whole school scene theres real life. i mean whatever constitutes as real in my little world anyway. theres my friends family and bf. friends = good, we dont see eachother a lot but i really appreciate them. sometimes i feel like im not on a level anymore where i can tell them anything since im different as if and they may subconciously judge me, but even if i cant fully talk to them theyre wonderful people. my family on the other hand is rocky. most of the time i avoid being home as often as possible. its not like they make me feel like crap contstantly, but were always fighting and if were not were not doing much of anything because we have no relationship. then again my parents do get some snaps since theyve been giving me more freedom lately. buts as spidermans uncle says ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and i dont wnat to fuck up my new power and they become completely anal with me, so now theres added pressure. almost like theyve laid off me but now im laying it on myself hmmm. then theres jason. for all of you who didnt know (since i dont call throughout the halls about us) we decided to stay together even though hes at college. which made a lot of sense at the time, but both of us underestimated how much it sucks to have a long distance relationship. its just really hard, and really sad. he visted the past weekend which was amazing, but still.... i dont know it just sucks.

well i suppose thats a brief update on my life for those of us who havent talked in a while. sorry this enrty was a complete and total whine entry but its been a hwile since ive updated.

ps. yay for getting int o moon over buffalo

   ------Alice Cooper

Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya
Can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya
That's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Well we got no class
And we got no principles (principals)
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely



and additionally to this: call me, for i wish to hang out with peoples! 
otherwise (if i dont see you): have an awsome summer!"

So, I broke down and bought a Desert Eagle .50ae.  AWww yeah, it's a big daddy gun!   :)   I haven't had a chance to go shoot it yet, but I'm sure I will in the next couple of days...  I'm going to buy the .44MAG Barrel and mag for it though, mostly for shooting costs.   At $1.50 per shot it going to get freagin expensive!  I can't WAIT to blast a few rounds out of it though!

Anyway, I just had to share!!!

"event","Sarah and I had a really good thanksgiving. We had about 16-18 people over for thanksgiving (All family), so it was really nice. We cooked 2 turkeys (one baked, one fried) and both turned out really well. We also made mashed potatoes, baked yams, sweet peas, green bean cassarole, and my aunt (Well, Sarah's Aunt, but mine too now) brought the desserts (including a home-made pecan pie!!!) It was delicious...

Before we ate, we said grace. Well, I said it. It went something like this....

""Lord, thank you for bringing us all here together for Thanksgiving. Thank you for giving us all of this great food on which to feast, we enjoy it. Thank you for another wonderful year of life and enjoyment. Also, Sarah and I would like to thank you for the newest addition to our family, who will be here July 19th. Amen."" Our parents were all speechless for a littlebit....

You heard me, we're pregnant!!! We don't know if it's a boy or girl yet, we JUST started the 6th week of pregnancy. Although, we're both hoping for a boy....

I'm so excited. I've been reading my little book ""So, you're going to be a dad..."" (Which I HIGHLY recommend, by the way). Sarah has been doing SOOO well. She gave up caffeine completely (And she's used to drinking 6cups of coffee per day or so), and she isn't even taking Tylenol for her lack-of-caffeine-headaches. I know that was so hard of her to do, and I'm such a proud husband! I can't even IMMAGINE going through the things she has been/is going to go through, so I just try to be there for her the best I can... So far things have been ok for her, she's been tired, but hasn't been sick or anything...

Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving too! I definately have alot to be thanksful for!!!"

"event","There is a REALLY awesome program out there (For those who don't know) called SiteAdvisor.  This company created a ""bot"" equivelant to internet explorer with NO updates, and uses this bot to crawl out on every website possible.  When it comes across one that tries to attack the bot, it puts a red flag next to it.  It also uses a specific email address for each site, so it knows which site is emailing it.  It's really neat.  Also, when you do searches on any web searching engine, it shows this flag (red, green, yellow, etc.,) next to the link.  You can just move your mouse over the flag and it will tell you what's wrong, and click on the flag and it will give you a detailed explanation (IE., one of the links points to www.whatever.com which is a RED Site, or one of the downloads, whatever.exe, is a virus, stuff like that).

So today I was looking around on click2houston.com, and they had a thing with rubber ducks moving across the sreen.  If you hit 20 ducks, you get a free $20 gift certificate to Chillis.  I just thought it looked fun, so I started shooting the ducks.  Well, it took me to a page to get my gift certificate, and Site Advisor popped up and said ""After entering our email address on this site, we got 107 emails per week"".  SiteAdvisor is DEFINATELY an awesome program, worth checking out...."

1 large entertainment center.  Holds my 33"" tv, plus my dvd player, all my DVD's, etc.  It's massive, probably almost 7' tall and about 7' wide also.  It's got 4 tinted tempered glass doors.  I had to cut out a whole where my DVD player was.  I think this thing was originally $450 or so.  $200?

1 3 cushion sofa.  The sofa is ugly (Striped) but I've got a nice brown slip cover on it already.  $20?

1 large wardrobe made of plywood.  It's in great shape, VERY sturdy, just not real pretty.  $20?

1 fender strat guitar in perfect condition, not a scratch on it, w/hard case (Which does have some scratches on it), electric tuner, and guitar book.  $250?

I can take pictures of any of it.  I will probably post more stuff once we move (LOTS of pots and pans that I don't really need anymore, glasses since we got new ones, plate sets since we got new ones, possibly an oak dining table w/chairs & oak sideboard w/mirror).  The wardrobe & guitar are available now, the entertainment center and sofa will be available in about 2 weeks.  I'm not sure what else I have available, but I'm sure there will be PLENTY once we move...  :)"

I got it stuck twice, and Sarah got it stuck twice (Well, her getting it stuck was worse!).  We went snowmobiling around the San Isabel national forest, and ate lunch in a small farm cabin.  It was SUCH a blast!  Unfortunately, I hurt my back really bad, so we couldn't go horseback riding up in fairplay, in the mountains.  I was very upset about that part!

I can't really set it up in the apartment, but it will do QUITE well once we get our house (We're targeting May/June timeframe).  Christmas eve we went to my dad's house about 10:15am, and left about 2:15pm.  We went to go look at some houses in the Champion's Forest area (To get an idea of the neighborhood) then went to Sarah's aunt's house for the evening.  

Sunday morning we just hung out with eachother, and took the dogs to the dog park in the afternoon.  That was a BLAST.  There were, probably, 75-80 dogs out there, so Blitz and Patches got to run and play and play and play.  I wish I had taken a tennis ball out there for them to play fetch with though.   After that we took them to my mom's house to give them a bath (Kinda tough giving them a bath in the bathtub.  Patches is 95lbs, Blitz is about 105lbs) then went home.   

Yesterday Sarah had a REAL bad toothache (Her whole jaw hurt) so we found an open dentist and went there.  Turns out she was having a wisdom tooth come in and it had gotten infected and so we had to get it pulled.  Poor thing.  She actually had two wisdom teeth pulled.

So they gave her some vicadin, but they didn't give her enough for me too!   The NERVE of them!   :)

"event","Okay, so this girl came to my wedding, and trash-talked my freagin wife!  I shouldn't really post it, but she said some things that to her were funny, but not to anyone else, and that were very hurtful to Sarah, and to me.  Worst of, she said these things to TWO of my groomsman (Tony, and my brother)!!  

So, my brother called her Sunday, and told her what a crappy friend she was being.  He said that she needed to either call me and apologize yesterday, or that he was going to call and tell me what was going on and what was said.  So, being the honorable brother he is, he did.  

So, then, she wrote ME an email blaming TONY (my groomsman) saying that he was pissed because his x-fiancee showed up, and so he was mad at Ty (For bringing the x) trying to start $hit with me by talking trash about Ty.  I replied back and said that Tony didn't say ANYTHING to me.  That she said those things to my BROTHER, and my BROTHER is the one who told me about it.  That Tony and Alan discussed it later, after they (Ty) had left.

Then, she replied with this:

""I was only kidding. Sorry Mikey. I didn't mean to offend. 
Tony is still full of shit... but I don't care about him he's nonconsequential. ""

What kind of apology is that???  ""Sorry...BUT BUT BUT""   So I replied back and said that I felt hurt and betrayed, and that I didn't feel like she was valuing my friendship, my relationship with Sarah, or Sarah's feelings....She replies with this:
""All I can say is sorry. If you can't ever forgive me then I guess so be it. ""

Ya know...It's one thing to say something bad about someone.  It's another to lie about it.  It's even WORSE to just not even give a real apology about it.  If she had said ""Ya know, I'm sorry, I did say those things.  I didn't mean anything offensive by them, I really just thought I was being funny, but I didn't think about how it would hurt ya'lls feelings, but I really should have known that it would not have been funny"", it would have been okay, but she couldn't do that, she had to give a ""fake"" apology....   :(

"event","So the wedding went really well, though there were a few snags.   The minister was one of them.  Ya know, I expected to be shafted by the place we had the wedding.  I expected to be shafted by the bar serving the alcohol.  I expected to be given crappy food, I didn't expect to be pushed around by the damn minister!  First, he tried to upcharge us by $50 because he had to drive so far, but the wedding cordinator lady (Who, BTW, left 1 week before the wedding!!) said he ALWAYS does it for $150 for people going to Pecan Grove (He wanted to charge us $200).

So, I wanted to stand at the front with the minister, and have my groomsmen walk people down the aisle.  He said he would not stand at the front until the unity candle had been lit, and the mothers/grandmothers were seated.  I asked him why not, he goes ""Well, I'll tell you why not, because I said so"".  My brother was SOOO angry that he had to walk out of the room.   So, my brother stood at the front with me and my other two groomsmen walked people down the aisle.

Fortunately, the place we had the wedding, did a GREAT job.  I don't think they shafted us on the bar, or the number of guests, or anything.  The food was great, the service was great.  Overall, I was QUITE pleased with the turnout.  

It feels good to be married.  It feels like we're more ""official"" and more ""longlasting"" for some reason.  I know, kinda odd, but still.  It feels like we have something that is stronger now than it was before, like it's less likely to be broken, or grow old, or tired.  Maybe it's just cuz I'm super excited still....   hehe"

After eating on the balony looking at the gulf, I proposed to her infront of the swing and she accepted.  It was a really nice weekend.  My friend Mike Scott's mom (rented the house from her) gave Sarah and I a couple's massage from her fitness club on Saturday as an engagement present.  The house was way too dang big.  I wish I could have rented another house (And saved money!!) but I didn't want to wait any longer to propose....

I didn't want to leave on Sunday to come back home.  I was hoping to stay out there a bit longer.

We talked about it, and we still want to get married December 17th.  We don't know if we want a nice formal wedding, or a small small wedding and then an informal reception at one of our parent's houses.  Good thing about the latter, is that means we'll have alot more money for a honeymoon.   :)   We were hoping to go to Italy, but I don't think that's going to be feasible... :(

I know that in the long run, that's not really a long time to be dating, but someone once said to me ""When you know, you know..."".  I still have to buy a ring, talk to her parents, and decided how I want to do it.   Last time I proposed, I went ""Extravagant"", with a limo, nice restaurant, dressed SUPAH nice, etc..  Obviously, I can't do the same thing, but I want it to be the best that it can be.   So, any suggestions?  I was thinking the waterwall downtown, or perhaps getting up to sing karaoke at a bar/club and announcing it there...   I have no idea...

I'm meeting with a diamond wholesaler this Saturday, my appointment is at 11.  He's sold diamonds to a number of people at Dynegy, including a good friend of mine who just got married.   So I know he's fair and honest...  Hopefully it will pan out.   I'm expecting to do it in the next few weeks....   YAY!!!!

I'm so excited!!!!"

"event","Hey all,
	Tony and I are having a little get together this weekend, Saturday, April 2nd at 7:00pm.  We'll have a keg of home-brewed beer, and some alcohol, but feel free to bring your favorite drink.  The festivities will end whenever the last person leaves.  Click the link below to see where we live on a map, but here are some directions.  Feel free to bring anyone you'd like, just let me know how many people you will be bringing so we can plan food accordingly.

Take I45 south, past the beltway.
Take the 3rd exit past the beltway (2nd exit if you're coming from the beltway) which is 2351/Clear Lake City BLVD.  Turn RIGHT onto 2351
At the first stop light (Beamer) turn LEFT.
The road will force you to turn right onto Tall Ships.
The address is 2427 tall ships, on the left pretty far down.  You'll see two 2004 Chevy trucks with ""No Remorse Paintball"" stickers on the back.

"event","Okay, so I'm ALL moved into my new house.   I still have to go back to the old house to spackle the walls (Drilled through to connect my XBOX to my home network), but I've already cleaned the old house and everything.  I bought some new stuff for the house (pottery ashtrays w/sand, computer desk, floor mats, bar stools, etc.), but not a WHOLE lot.  I still have to unpack alot.  Fortunately most of it is unpacked.  My entire kitchen, bedroom, closet, bathroom, etc., is already unpacked.   The only thing LEFT to unpack is my second bedroom stuff (computer room) but that's going to wait until I get my computer desk setup so I can figure out what to keep, what to throw away, and what to sell.  I think I'm going to sell my nice entertainment center, and just buy a new one when Tony (My roommate) moves out in a year...

OH, guess who we saw there!   Pascal (Doodle)!!!   I honestly didn't think it was her, Tracy recognized her.  I still didn't think it was her till I asked her if she was Pascal..   :)  So she and her friend Mit hungout with us most of the night.  Here are all the photos (Some from the party, some from my lakehouse, some of my cute puppy, some of the paintball field in Jasper)

I wokeup drunk.   Wobbling from room to room.  That sucked....I'm starting to feel better though.

Also, my brother has this sleeping bag that's really awesome.  He got it in the military, I think it was about $300.  It's actually two sleeping bags.   The outside bag is good to 30degrees F, the inside is good from 30degrees F down to -10degrees F, and if you combine them it's good to -50degrees F.   Pretty freagin sweet, he found it at a resale shop for $90, so he got it for me....

"event","Okay, so this weekend was awesome, and crappy...   First, the awesome.

Saturday, I wokeup, got ready, picked up Tony and Jason and went to the gunshow.  Walked around for awhile, and finally bought a Kahr PM9 http://www.kahr.com/pistols_PM9093.html, a nice pro range bag, 500rnds of 9mm ammo, a NICE cleaning kit to clean ANY caliber, a thigh holster for my Sig 229 (To use at the deer lease, and at the paintball field with a paintball pistol), and an IWB holster for my new Kahr.  I bought Tony a Glock 27 also.  He's going to pay me back, I just lent him the money until his bonus check comes in.

So I left there and went straight to Baytown to hangout with the kids for a little while before we went to church, then played halo2 (After having a paintball team meeting).  I stayed for a little while, but left before everyone else (Except Tracy, he left EARLY).

So Sunday I wokeup pretty sick.  Jason, Tony, and I all went to the range.   We started out going to Pasadeena (However you spell it) gun range, then tried to go to lake houston gun range, then finally ended up going BACK to the west side to go to American Shooters.  That took about 3hrs out of the day driving around.  We finally got there and I was able to shoot my new toy.  It shoots REALLY well.  A little bit to the right, and it's tough to hold the gun with only 2 fingers and a thumb (forefinger doesn't really hold the gun, just pulls the trigger, and my pinky hangs off the gun), but all in all it wasn't all that bad.  I like having something I can just throw in my pocket WITH the holster and not have to worry about it.

NOW, the suck....
Sunday I felt like crap all day...And it carried over till Monday.  I still feel a little bad today, but much much much better than yesterday or Sunday...

Oh, my neighbor brought me Blitz's food from the vets today (She works there) and bought him a bandana for Halloween.   That was sooo sweet.   I'm not sure if I want to make him wear a bandana for halloween, but it was a super sweet gesture...  :)"

"event","This past weekend has been a BLAST!  This is the FIRST game (out of 4) that someone on our team hasn't generaled.   In Jan, my brother Alan was general, then in April and again in (I think) July, Tony (Turk) was general.   In all 3 cases, we had to be on the field anytime the game was going on.  We never left until the game was completely over, or breaking.  So this game, when I wanted to come off the field, I did.  When I wanted to play, I did.  I didn't have any true responsibillity, and I LOVED it.

Today, I wanted to wakeup about 10am or so to get stuff done.  I needed to unload my truck from the trip (Got home about 10:30pm last night), clean my truck out, and get everything put up...   Well, I wokeup about 1:30pm, and felt/looked like SHIT.   I probably had 2"" bags under my eyes, it was horrid.  So I went to the store to get some stuff (cat litter, milk, tuna, water) and then took my truck to clean it.   Cleaned the outside pretty good (Then it rained) and cleaned the inside really well.   Conditioned all the leather, armor alled all of the plastic, cleand the carpets, even used armor all on the floor mats..   So now, the inside of my truck looks BRAND NEW, and the outside is spotty from the recent rain.  :(

I was going to come back inside and clean/put up all of my gear, but now I'm being just plain lazy....  Watching TV and relaxing...."

in spanish we had a quiz
the first part was easy but i totally didn't know what the words meant in the second part
hopefully i passed it though
i'm excited for pe
me and andy are gonna dominate again
and win that free pacer or mile

I've been let down so many times
I was tired of hurtin'
So tired of searchin'
Til you walked into my life

It was a feelin' I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Everytime I look at you

I don't know where I'd be
Without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

You stand by me
And you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy
You're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble when we touch
And oh the look in your eyes
When we make love

You're more than a lover
There could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh, we just get closer
I fall in love all over
Everytime I look at you

I don't know where I'd be

"event","homecoming was so much fun
well we all met at justin whitman's house
which is absolutely amazing
then we all went to red robin in seattle
and ate dinner
after that we had some time left so we went to the space needle for a few minutes and took some pictures
and then we went to the beach for awhile 
it was pretty cool
then we went to the dance
but we were 35 minutes late
thats okay though
after homecoming we all went to robbie's house 
my mom came too and partied with all the other mom's hah
we left at like 2:30 in the morning
and didn't get home until 3 because i had to get some clothes from my dad's house
and i didn't fall asleep until 4
i got up at like 8 in the morning
i'm so tired this week
i just wanna sleep the whole time
hmm well yesterday was alright
i forgot about my homework though
cuz i was so tired from saturday
so i didn't get anything done
which kinda pisses me off 
there shouldn't be school the monday after homecoming
goodness
then i stayed after school forever cuz my team said there was some volleyball meeting at 4
but there wasn't
i was waiting at school until like 5 until my coach came
and all we were doing was turning in our fricken jerseys
we were supposed to get our sweats
but the denali lady hasn't given them to us yet
cuz she's retarded
but we did get our t-shirts
but i haven't gotten them from kelsey yet
cuz i haven't seen here and she's been busy practicing and stuff for the volleyball tournaments
but yeah
i'm hoping i will get everything sometime this week
because i really really want them
grr
hmmm
spanish was pretty fun today
we played battle ship
and we talked about our little project
we have to do some fashion show thingy and describe all of the clothes we are wearing
should be pretty fun
so yeah

but after school i have to stay for another hour
and make up a gay science test for buchli

"event","yup
still bored
i tryed to do something
but all i ended up doing was playing 3d ping pong
and i won hah
my fricken aunt wont talk to me anymore
i email her on her blackberry
and she never replys anymore :(
oh well
i didn't wanna talk to her anyways
haha
hmm i wanna go to youth group after volleyball
cuz aaron told me that all the ballers will be there
which includes my awesome homecoming date
they're all gonna start following the lord now
oh boy
so excited
i must witness this
it will be truly amazing
with a capital a
and every letter after it
haha i love hilary shes the one who thought of that
the ""and every letter after it""
tehehe
i love her very much so
she completes me
i made her a sign
it was pretty great there
she loved it of course 
and i think that everyone else will too
if they saw it
i left her a myspace comment :)
hmm what else do i have to say 
i officially need to find a place to stay the night after homecoming
cuz i really wanna go to robbie's after it
and my mom is a bitch and she said no
even though i'm not gonna be with her
i'll be with my dad
but whatever
maybe i should ask my dad anyways
he wouldn't notice 
cuz he's been acting funny because of his hypoglycemia
he always falls asleep 
for long periods of time
and if i came home around 2:30 in the morning
he probably wouldn't even know
hmm that's what i'll do
woohoo
um yeah this is long enough
and class gets out in like 10 minutes

i'm in computer programming
as usual
this week is homecoming week
and today was the freshman spirit day
but of course no one dressed up
because our little ""penny lane"" theme is pretty gay
but homecoming should be fun
there's gonna be an after party at rob's house
and my parents better let me go to it
but my mom's psycho so i just hafta ask my dad
it should be alright with him
since he usually says yes to most things
but i dunno
maybe i should spend the night at a friend's house after or something
but whatever
tomorrow i have a fricken science test
and i'm gonna fail
because i have buchli
and he pretty much hates me
and i'm not very smart
i know nothing about science
so that shouldn't help
this weekend was funnn
on thursday i went to a UW volleyball game with my team
they beat UCLA 3-0
then i went to see into the blue with michayla, robbie and travis
after the movie i spent the night at michayla's
the next day we all went to robbie's house and chilled
and then there was a football game
they won, but it rained like the whole time so it kinda sucked
after the game we went back to robbie's for a few hours
and then i had to go home
on saturday i just stayed at home for awhile
and at 10:20 i went to another movie with michayla, jaron, travis, robbie and cameron
don't ever see The Fog
it's horrible
and a waste of money
but it was still fun
and then on sunday i just went to lisa's house for a few hours
hmm
yeah it was like the best weekend ever
but this weekend should be fun too
cuz of homecoming woot woot
um well today i also have a volleyball game
we're playing Mercer Islanddd
we better win because they pretty much suck
but yeah
this week is the last week of volleyball
then i wanna start club
should be pretty exciting
i hope we get our fricken sweats soon
we're the only team who doesn't get sweats until the end of the season
which is pretty retarded
but that's okay
well this is getting long enough
so i'm gonna try and do some work"

and i can't concentrate
because i have a major headache
and i feel like my head is going to explode
and i'm super tired
so i'm just sitting here
doing nothing
which isn't very good
because i'm falling behind
and i don't need to fail this class
because i'm probably failing buchli's gay class
because he fricken hates me
but i hate him too
so i don't really care.
i have a volleyball game today
but my ankle hurts really bad
i hope it will be fine by the time the game starts
because i wanna play
and i didn't get to play in the games last week
because i forgot to tell my coach that i was leaving from newport
this class is over in like 20 minutes
so i'm gonna go"

i don't know
so right now i'm in computer programming
which is pretty much the most boring class ever
ugh sometimes i hate having 88 minutes classes 
we're supposed to be making some program to be like the game leap frog
or somethin like that
but i don't feel like it
cuz i didn't read the online course thing
and i have no idea how to do anything
and i don't wanna ask for help
hmm so in about 10 minutes i will leave and say i hafta go to the bathroom
but i really will be going to hang out with my friends at first lunch
but only for a few minutes
man that's going to be very exciting
and i'm going to be emailing my aunt on her blackberry the whole time
that's pretty much all i do 7th period
unless i decide to actually get some work done

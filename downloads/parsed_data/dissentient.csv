I like outer space. I like it good.<br /><br /><b>12. First thought when the alarm went off this morning?</b><br />My alarm didn't go off this morning. If it did i would be concerned considering it isnt powered at this time of week.<br /><br /><b>13. Last thought before going to sleep last night?</b><br />Sleep is good. Mmmmm sleepy sleep.....<br /><br /><b>14. Do you miss being a child?</b><br />Who said i have grown up? Well i guess physically i have. In which case, no. I like my body as an adult, except for the body hair. I don't like that one bit.<br /><br /><b>Where is 15?</b><br />Up your bum.<br /><br /><b>16. What errand/chore do you despise?</b><br />Pfff. I don't do chores or errands. Please. <br /><br /><b>17. If you didn't have to work, would you volunteer?</b><br />Story of my life. And even when i work i volunteer. It is the path to righteousness. Get off the couch and help someone people!<br /><br /><b>18. Get up early or sleep in?</b><br />Both. Get up eary and enjoy the morning. Then go to bed early so you can sleep in and still wake up early the next day.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>19. What is your favorite cartoon character?</b><br />Ho mer eh er<br /><br /><b>20.

If a man and women can be together for life happilly then it is ok. If not marrage is a bad thing as if they have to break up they are breaking an oath to god. As i don't believe in devorce its either marrage for life or don't get married.

I was instructor at karate tonight. I taught ""Jodan ni"" Kata. I need to get a new Gi considering i'm training 4 times per week. And what makes things worse is i have to get 2 more mouth guards and a couple pairs of foot armor. I predict i will be ninja'ing my weeks food from the neighbors again. Each week i do this the danger grows. Last week i almost fell into a punji pit while stealing a cheesecake.
Despite being injured and aparently utter batshit in the head things are going really good. I fully beat my step mum in a game of Monopoly, and last nights game of scrable kicked ass. Whats better is that i won and held the lead the whole way by around 100 points.&nbsp;

"event","I think i saw an add for ""Iron man"" the movie. But i could be wrong. There i was, standing in the foyer to Balmoral movie cinema staring up at the preview screen, half frustrated that AVP2 was not showing there. Incedently it wasn't showing at hawthorn either. This made me a sad panda. Shortly after i found myself driving around the city looking for free parking. My patience worn thin it wasn't long until i was under the Myer center with a parking ticket hanging out of my mouth and the radio shouting static at me complaining about the aparent lack of FM reception. I am reminded of Diablo the game where you are constantly decending levels until you reach hell whe i park in the Myer center. The 40 degree heat down there only adds to the ambience, the vibe... Mabo. Paris hilton decided not to be nice and hold the elevator for me. The next meat shute took me topside and a breif but inconvenient walk right around the whole bloody building ,and another elevstor ride saw me feeling poopy that the movie i wanted to see wasn't on at this place either. So i walked down to the Regent with my fingers crossed but no luck there. SO back to hell to retreive the car and paying for parking on the way out the radio buzzed back into reception life and i drive half way across town to Chermside. The ""Sideh"" ! It did not let me down. AVP2 was alright. Better than expected. I now find myself doing the doogy howser md thing where he makes an entry into his blog about how gheye his day was. Eat my nuggets."

"event","I took my step mum to Alma park zoo last week. I bought a bag of animal feed and a map. I fed a peacock and befreinded an emu. I fed numerous kangaroos too and hung out with them under their litle shelter from the rain. I was reading my map to look for direction and all of a sudden a deer ate the corner of it. I had no idea what was at the top right of the park. And then another deer snatched my feed back and ran off with it. I then found about 100 chicks. Yellow and black ones. They were all chicken nugget size. I played with them for 10 minutes picking them up and feeding them. Spuish. Sharnie is the best."

The whole excersise thing is going really good. About 2 hours each session 6 days a week sometimes 7 days, often 2 times a week.&nbsp;
Karate is getting busy again which means 4 times a week and 1 or 2 privet lessons. Karate is pretty cool, and i actually taught my sempai something the other night.&nbsp;
I have a couple more cars since i last updated. An old COlt hatchback to zip around in and a 2003 AU falcon, which i find myself driving more often than the colt."

I have a scientificly proven technology that provides endless water. A small unit produces 25 litres of water for example. Anywhere where there is humidity in the air this technology will work. The machine literally extracts the water from the air. The ocean relenishes the water into humidity.<br />Its not a new technology actually. It was first invented by the ancient Greeks. It is called ""Reverse osmosis"". I have spent 1 year trying to spread it but something i am doing is not right. I wan't as many people to know about this before they make us drink that horrible stuff. My solution is pure and ionised as well as virtually free once set up. I think the latter is part of the reason why people in parlement dont like it.<br />You can build the units easy <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a><br />Or buy thme form various places world wide.&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis</a><br />"

You are gifted when it comes to protecting yourself<br>from judgements cast upon you by others.  In<br>fact, you are not easily thrown by external<br>reality.

"event","Bored like a boring person.
I havent slept much, so maybe being bored can easilly turn into relaxing. Maybe even sleep. Went for a drive looking for trouble. Didnt find any despite efort. Except for a lancer gli which wassnt worht the litre of fuel spent. And a s13 K. Which also wassnt worth the efort. I remember when i had slight COmpetition against the average silvia. New tires help. Bridgestone Grid's. Have made a good contact at coleman tires. He gives me massive discounts due to work contracts. Its an intersting experiance being able to hook up from the word go. New stall converter would come in handy. And am thinking about a lower diff ratio. Maybe a 4.11/1 or more. These small changes are both cheap and have big time improvements. By a second at least. More so if i can launch around 2000rpm instead of 1000.
I Went to work for a couple of hours today. Afterwards i went ot pick up Drjon to go out ot near woodford for beltane. By using less than 5% throttle we managed 130kms on 20 litres of fuel. Mostly on high way. But marvelous fule economy. Over 6 kms/litre. Normally only get 4/litre.
*Looks over at race carburetta*
I expect to have excedingly bad fuel economy soon.
Goal of 12.00 second quarter. Soon.
Yeh may sleep now."

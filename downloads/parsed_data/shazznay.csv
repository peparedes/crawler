"event","Start off with 10 weird things/habits/little known facts about yourself. People who get tagged need to write a blog of their own 10 weird habits/things/little known facts as well as state this rule clearly. At the end you need to choose six people to be tagged and list their names. No tagbacks!<br /><br />1. I know the lyrics of every stupid catchy song playing in the radio. And I <b>have to</b> sing it aloud whenever I'm hearing it.<br /><br />2. I am fucking scared of driving and the drivers. I am able to stand 15 minutes on the path just to be sure that there's absolutely no car that could run over me. My friends get mad because of that.<br /><br />3. I see the fish from SpongeBob Squarepants in almost every second face I see in the street. Sometimes Robert reminds me of those little fish, too. :)<br /><br />4. I have to smell every new exercise book, magazine, etc. that I was given or I have bought.<br /><br />5. Michal said I could make various funny faces :D<br /><br />6. He also said I walked in a funny way :))<br /><br />7. I hate the smell of cigarettes but I still smoke.<br /><br />8. When I'm bored in the school I use skin lotion on my hands a lot.<br /><br />9. I was better than 96% of Slovak students who took the test from English at the finals. I have no idea how that happened. lol<br /><br />10. I'm not able to talk normally with girls. They are too complicated to me and I think I'm scared of them. I never know how to act or what to say so they wouldn't misunderstand me somehow. I cannot be much open with them (untill I'm using LJ, heh) so I really don't know how a girl-talk looks like :).<br /><br /><br />ok, I think there's no-one I could tag, everyone has written this already...but maybe Dawnie? :-P or Teri :)."

Larry: Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy to confirm they're depressed. If they were happy they couldn't be depressed anymore. They'd have to go out into the world and live. Which can be depressing."

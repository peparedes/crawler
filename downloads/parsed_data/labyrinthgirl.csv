<h3>A RED Dragon Lies Beneath!</h3>
</a>
I took the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html"" target=""new"">Inner Dragon online quiz</a> and found out I am a Red Dragon on the inside. Remember Smaug? Yep, Red Dragon. Oh, my friend I'm in good company. Red dragons are the most vile and crafty of all the dragons. They are also the most dangerous of all dragons. As such they are the Fire Elemental dragons. Reds have a nasty tendency towards luring you in with quiet words and soft emotions, then wrapping their scaly tails around you and biting off your puny little human head. Fun, no?<br><br>
But of course, Reds aren't all about killing and treasure hoarding. I like to invent creative traps, relax in the mouths of volcanoes, fly over vast forests looking for men ...er... sheep (<i>yeah...</i>), and pick fights. My favorable attributes are Summer, the sword, fire, courage, passion, will power, and leadership. If dragons went to war, they'd rally behind me in a snap. Well, me or a Copper Dragon. But those Coppers are wusses anyway, and I could beat one up to take command. In fact, I probably would considering my breath weapon is good old fashioned Fire, and plenty of it. Oh it's good to be the king.

"event","So, in case I haven't told you, my friend, we'll call her ""Jenny"" is pregnant.  She is only a freshman, but she is still excited about being pregnant.  Her boyfriend is excited too.  That is cool, but at the same time, she still is too young to have a baby, but I can't tell her that because she wants me to be happy for her, and in a way I am.  Her boyfriend came for lunch today (he goes to a different high school) and then she left with him to ditch 4th period.  After school I saw her and she said that the security dude caught them and he told him that she was pregnant and was feeling sick so he was going to take her to her grandmother to go to the hospital.  This was true, but the stupid principal didn't believe her and she had in school supspension for the rest of the day!  She was puking most of the time and this pissed me off because they didn't believe her!  Oh well....

I am worried, the dude I told said he is going to go bug the guy and then tell my friend that her ""lover""lol, told him!  If he does that could mean shit for me.  I know, I know, it's my fault, but still.  Scary!  I have a drama performance tomorrow.  I am very nervous, my scene needs a lot more work!  But I am excited still.  Well, that is all for now! Byes!"

The only problem is my friend....this is going to be a little graphic, so you might not want to know.  She almost had sex with a guy..eh hem...man that is 24 years old!  I am not going to share her name because that is just rude, but I am a bit worried.  She isn't talking to him anymore, so that is a good thing.  I hope no one I know reads this, because I might get in big trouble for telling the world!lol.  Well, that is it for now I suppose."

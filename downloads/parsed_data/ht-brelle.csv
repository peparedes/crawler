"event","Had a proper meeting, after many passing encounters and sightings, with Journeyman Morallen. Irritating man: condescending, needling, ""light-hearted."" Called me ""ducks."" Am not a duck.

Beginning to suspect serious lapses in professionalism at this Hall. The Xorvian-Brady mess can go without saying, but adds to the problem, obviously. Symptomatic? Regarding behavior towards me: Is this hazing of the newcomer? First Verme, now Morallen . . . Expected to be treated with proper respect and deference to my skills where appropriate. Instead: some kind of odd flirting over records, and now being called a duck. He misinterpreted what I meant by ""plucking,"" too. Obviously a communication problem, though not one over which I will worry overmuch.

Still: must speak with Master Aerrin. Might be missing something here.

Healer Lounge
This is a very cozy room where Healers often spend their free time relaxing, talking, and participating in a little recreation.  Dotted about the room are small tables and big comfy looking chairs that are great for sitting down and talking in.  Also there are tables set up around the room with chairs set at them, to be used for studying, or any other activity that might need the support of a table.
In one wall is the doorway that leads into the Healer Great Hall, and the rest of the Hall.  Other doorways are quietly recessed around the room, leading off to healer quarters.  One leads to the Apprentice Dorms, while another goes to the hallway that houses the rooms of Journeymen and Masters.
You see Corwin, Apprentice Dart Board, Ubiquitous Apprentice, and Klah here.
Aerrin and Morallen are here.
--
[Aerrin was just leaving.]

Her open notebook leading the way, Brelle wanders into the lounge on a slow, reading walk, absently moving around obstacles on the way to whatever comfy chair might catch her.

""Thank you, ma'am.""  Morallen replies, although the continued formality is accompanied by a casual flick of his fingers near his right temple and away.  He then turns again to his wax, in the form of a large sheet two inches thick that's spread out across one of the study tables, monopolizing it entirely.  A quarter of the sheet has been sliced into bricks and is in the process of being stacked.

Brelle skirts the wax-sheet work, sparing an idly curious glance on the way, and settles into the nearest chair. There. She even hooks a leg over the overstuffed arm, to dangle and swing and prop up the book in which she now scribbles a note here and there.

""You know,"" says Morallen aloud to the nearly-empty room as he makes more little piles of wax blocks.  ""I know intellectually that you're Journeywoman Brelle.  I've seen you in passing and at meetings, even.  But I don't think I've actually met you.""  What?  Not disturb someone else's reading?  

--
Morallen
Standing a comfortable six feet in height and of medium build, Morallen's form isn't one designed to draw attention to him. But while he's not a one to stop crowds in their tracks, a carelessly waved tousle of sandy brown hair and the smooth angles of a face full of Gallic ancestry lend him a certain amount of dry charm. Full lips are almost always quirked with the touch of an easy smile, and his hazel eyes are certainly his most remarkable feature. Shifting with his moods, they can be easygoing and warm, or stern and severe as a winter's storm.
A rare touch of formality hangs about Morallen this evening, his normal basic black shirt and slacks covered by a dress robe in the pure Healer purple of Journeyman rank, free of trimming beyond the orange and white shield of Ista Hold over the left breast. Of course his hair retains it's normal irrepressible tousle, and decidedly informal sandals are on his feet.  'Rallen's Bag 'O' Tricks hangs heavily from Morallen's shoulder.
He is an adult of about 36. He is awake, but seems rather distracted.
--

Not that it's going to stop her reading: Brelle answers without looking up, though she does frown over a note that just won't come out quite right in the margins, ""And you're Journeyman Morallen. Does this count as a meeting?""

""It could if we wanted it to,""  Morallen replies, settling down onto one of the chairs at his table after first spinning it on one leg so that he can sit backwards and fold his arms over the back, one hand stilll holding the wax cutting knife he's been using.  ""Or, we could just toss this up as another random meeting, and have some grandly formal scene as a proper meeting.  Scheduled.  In robes.""

Brelle's mouth crooks up at one corner, and she shakes her head slightly. Her stylus sweeps a bold underlining across the current page. ""I fear that I still haven't unpacked my robes, good sir. You'd have me at a disadvantage.""

""You could borrow mine,""  is the suggestion floated, Morallen favouring Brelle with a crooked grin.  ""I always feel like a giant, ambulatory grape in them ayways.  Which I swear is a tactic to convince us we -want- to be promoted out of journeyman rank and into reams of paperwork.""  Mastery, apparently.

Now Brelle looks up, glancing sidelong at the man with deep, dark eyes open wide to absorb him. His dimensions. And then roll. ""No,"" she replies briskly, ""but I thank you for the offer. I'll remember it the next time I need to get purple."" She reads another moment or two. Then: ""I like paperwork."" Obviously.

""Nice.  Want mine?""  Morallen promptly banters back, bouncig a brick of wax from one hand to the other because it's there, because he can, and because he's somewhat of a mild hyperactive.

""No, thank you."" Polite, the woman. Brelle the busy. But manners call, so . . . ""What are you working on? With the paperwork.""

""Oh, just standard marking.""  Morallen assures insouciantly, adding a second block of wax and starting to juggle them.  ""It's just a beast to do because the students invariably whinge about not being able to read my handwriting.  Yours, hoever...""  He leeeeeans over the chair to see for himself.  ""Perfection.""

Brelle stiffens at that lean, and she gives him a dark-eyed look, indeed, over her shoulder. ""If you would like to see my work,"" she says, 'brisk' moving into 'brusque,' ""I would be happy to show you, if you ask. And please watch the juggling? I've no mind to get hit in the head with wayward wax.""

""Prickly one, aren't you?""  Morallen inquires, although he does unlean and move his juggling to a distance he judges safe.  Only polite, after all.  ""And dedicated, formal and precise.  Interesting.""

""Thank you,"" is Brelle's level response. She relents to slant him a shoulder's shrug, and puts her hand between the pages to hold her place as she closes the book. ""If you were categorizing me, I suppose you might place me in the acerbic group. I am desiccating, and have been known to cause irritation.""

""Naw, I'm not a mindhealer,""  Morallen shakes his head, tossing the bricks of wax a little bit higher and then promptly dropping one.  It cracks in half on impact, and with a muttered grumble he replaces the survivor on the table and tosses the casualty into the low fire on the hearth.  ""I just like adjectives.""

Brelle eyes him. ""Why?""

""Because everyone ignores them in favour of adverbs.""  Morallen replies, meandering back to his table and reheating his knife in the flame of his candle.  ""Adjectives need their time in the light too, y'know.""

Brelle decides, ""Not a mindhealer, but you sound like a harper. /Words./"" That comes out with faint but clear suspicion. ""You seem to have quite the handle on the language, so why do you dislike paperwork so?""

Morallen laughs at that, shaking his head and setting his ever-so-fetching tousle of hair to looking still more tousled.  ""It's possible you haven't heard the stories about me and drunken poetry.  No Harper here.  And I just find paperwork boring.""  he reveals.  ""Now, case reports, those are things someone can use in the future, to help the same patient, or to figure out something about another one, or to teach some new kid what to look for.  Paperwork?  It's basically writing down a record no-one will read about events only of interest to the people who took part in 'em.""

Stretching the ankle of the leg over the chair's arm, Brelle comments mildly, ""I read them. Those old records you're deriding, that is. They're a trove of valuable information and can make for entertaining reading, to boot."" The tousled hair gets hardly an automatic glance with his headshake; she's too intent on vivisecting him with her gaze. ""Case works /are/ paperwork, just of a different nature. Unless I'm misunderstanding you...?""

""Well, then you're wierd.""  Morallen replies with amiable good cheer, ignoring the fact that he's being stared at by the simple reason of having his back half turned as he slices up the last of his sheet of wax.  ""And case reports aren't the sae sort of paperwork because you're usually filling them out while you're on the job, not scrabbling up memories afterwards.""

Brelle admits, ""I've not done many cases, so you have me there. All right."" She expands her scrutiny to the waxwork, then narrows it back on him with positive curiosity. ""I'm weird because I enjoy researching in old records? That's ... quite an indictment, I must say. I'll have to remember it. Maybe Master Aerrin will send me back to Fort for being -- weird.""

""Oh, no, Fort doesn't like wierdness, you see,""  Morallen points out, turning back now that his bricks are cut and needing to cool along the edges before he can stack them.  ""Fort ships its wierdness down to Ista so that they don't have to deal with it.  If you point out that you're wierd, your only hope of escape is a posting to High Reaches or another of the weyrs, where they're yet more wierd.""

""Crackdust,"" Brelle calls that entire spiel, with withering emphasis. ""Fort is /not/ weird. It's the finest Hall on Pern, and it might have its eccentric members -- I studied under one, myself -- but weird? No, not even enough for shipments to other, less fortunate Halls. This place, on the other hand..."" She snorts. ""At least Fort isn't plagued with fights over beach volleyball or whatever that nonsense was that caught Xorvian.""

""That's because Fort aggressively roots out any and all wierdness.  It's not -traditional- to be wierd... and I -was- there for seven turns before I came here, ducks,""  Morallen points out with a smirk.  ""Of course, you would've been in the female apprentice dorms, so perhaps girls are more conventional.  Also, Xorvian and Brady are both from Fort initially.""

""Ah, I'd forgotten: the plural of 'anecdote' /is/ 'data,' isn't it?"" Brelle doesn't give ground, and there's tension anew in the lines of her neck and shoulders. ""Granted their aberrations, did you truly find the place so strange as to be regaling me with it now? It's an interesting conversational tactic, Morallen, but I don't think it's having an agreeable effect.""

""In other words, you -are- prickly and I'm annoying you.""  Morallen seems satisfied with this.  He turns back to his wax, pokes the edges of one brick consideringly, and then gets down to stacking.

Brelle says, ""Yes, to both parts."" Her smile flickers brief and sharp. ""I don't bother to hide it, so I apologize if I've offended you with it. 'May cause irritation,' as I told you upfront.""

""Oh, hardly.  I annoy enough people that it'd be rather unfair for me to get annoyed if they got annoyed.""  Morallen allows over his shoulder.   ""They really only keep me around because the patients like me.""

Brelle wonders, ""Because you annoy them?""

""Not really.  They find me refreshingly light-hearted.""  Morallen replies.  The fact that he's simply damn' good at what he does has never dawned on him.  After all, talent equals promotion, and promotion equals paperwork.  ""But I'll go take my paraffin elsewhere and leave you to your wierd reading, if you like.""

Brelle's smile ticks again. ""An honorable concession, but no, you don't have to. Even 'light-hearted' company is better than none, on a slow day, which is what I'm having."" She lifts her chin to indicate the wax. ""However, if you do need to work ... go ahead, and I'll see you at the next meeting. Now that we've had a proper one of our own, we might even converse again. Weirder things,"" she deadpans, ""have happened.""

""I like you, ducks.""  says Morallen with a grin.  And that, it seems, is that.  Although it does take him a couple more minutes to get his bricks of wax stacked in such a way that he can carry them off.

Brelle points out, ""Even though I'm not a duck? Or weird.""

""Give it some time.""  
Says Morallen.  

Brelle snorts, and there's a sliver of honest grin. ""Oh, now I have to, don't I? All right, Journeyman: as soon as I sprout feathers, I will call upon you to show you the proof of my Ista Hall adjustment. Promise not to pluck me.""

The only answer to that is a chuckle and a final comment trailing back from the main hall.  ""My fiancee'd object to any... plucking, I think.""

"event","Finally caught up with Master Aerrin. Out on the beach, as it happened, and Xorvian there, too. Some kind of emotions twisting between them. From his side only? From both?

Will be meeting with Aerrin to discuss teaching assignments.  Will be needing a stiff shot of mango brandy from the bottle in my trunk the night before, to be able to discuss teaching assignments. Shard it all.

Aerrin not pleased with the idea of my applying to master's study? Not sure. Can ask, but probably moot: they need teachers, and I'm not ready for that step. Just don't want to be tied to a curriculum for the rest of my days! Wanted change, in coming here, but not <em>that</em>. Compromise, as she said. Hope we can find one.

Will avoid Xorvian for a while. And Verme. And anyone else (aside from Aerrin, unfortunately) who calls me ""dear."" Shard that, too. Where do they get off with that? My <em>family</em> doesn't call me that. No respect; no boundaries.

Maybe a shot of mango brandy right now.

Logfile from Brelle.
--------------------
Main Beach
This long stretch of white sandy beach stands pristine among the beaches around Ista Island. The sand stretches off into the distance on either side of you, disappearing into the horizon. Several large uprooted trees dot the beach where they were most likely felled in a big storm. They look as if they'd make great benches, for people or firelizards alike. To the east, the crystal blue waters of the Hold cove roll up in gentle waves onto the beach, hissing softly as they ebb and flow. To the south, Ista Hold juts out of the cliff. Just west of here, a low bluff leads up to the grassy field that serves as the Hold's main gather grounds.
Curled up in the sand are twelve firelizards.
Aerrin is here.
--

The sun is just now beginning to sink over the horizon. Twilight finds Aerrin returning from a blissful early-evening spent in the herb gardens, and she looks a right mess as testament to her work. Both clothes and hands are dirt-stained and grubby, while her tightly-tucked hair is escaping into curly wisps that frizz out in the humidity. She does, however, look quite happy.

Xorvian is, in comparison to Aerrin, windblown, but disgustingly clean - the white of his neatly buttoned and pressed dress shirt stained a brilliant orange by the setting sun - black trousers and grey vest somehow having evaded the sand.  His heavily shined shoes have not been so fortunate, but as he's not really doing anything more strenuous than standing out on the beach with his hands in his pockets and squinting out at the horizon, there's really no reason to think that he needs to worry about getting very dirty anyway.

And Brelle completes it, neither happy nor windblown, but doughty and neat. She hasn't even brought anything outside with her -- no books, scrolls, or notes -- and so her arms swing along quite freely with the purposeful strides that get her /away/ from the Hall and into the fresh, clear, open air and the gloaming settling tropically thick upon it.

Aerrin begins to run a hand, woefully dirty, over her hair, and then grimaces as she thinks better of it. Er.. perhaps rinsing is in order. She crosses the sand toward the shoreline, and the pauses abruptly as she catches sight of Xorvian. Brelle, for the moment, is unnoticed. After a slow breath, she begins again, this time toward the Journeyman. ""I never would've pegged you as one for sunsets on the beach,"" she greets as she approaches.

Xorvian turns his head slowly to shift Aerrin out of his peripheral vision and into focus, a hard blink not doing much to clear the neon blur of the sunset still imprinted in the space before him.  Not that it really matters.  He knows the voice, and he can tell she's covered in grime without looking too closely - his nostrils actually flaring a bit at the smell of herbs and earth and that sort of thing in general before his attention flickers past her to settle on Brelle.  ""That's because you don't know anything about me.""

""Me?"" Brelle's deliberately light question leads her, deliberately casual, up to the pair of them. ""I don't know, no, beyond our past relationship, and there's not much there, nor should there be."" She gives Aerrin a cocked glance that's quickly dropped, if only for a moment, in respect. ""--Oh. I'm sorry to have interrupted.""

Aerrin is actually taken somewhat aback by that response, and were Xorvian still looking at her, he'd probably catch it in her expression. She collects herself quickly, however, in time to flash a bright grin at Brelle. ""Trust me, you're not interrupting a thing, dear,"" she assures her, and steps forward to pull her sandles off and begin to roll her pants up. Yes, she /is/ nearly forty-five turns old, thanks for asking. She's also immensely practical.

Xorvian looks back to Aerrin just in time to see her nice and collected, though the lack of a response is cause for a few more seconds of staring before he forces a thin smile in Brelle's direction, and...says nothing.  His right hand lifts out of its respective pocket long enough to scratch at the short whiskers that are currently doing a poor job of hiding the frownlines that reside beneath before falling back into place, and his focus moves back out onto the sunset.

Brelle accepts it with only a brief face-scrunch of bemusement. ""Thank you, ma'am,"" she responds politely. ""And good evening to you. --You both. Hello, Xorvian."" And back again, to the other woman, with sudden, unscrunched hope. ""Are you ... Master Aerrin? I've been trying to find you for days. When I haven't been working, I mean."" Let's not set the wrong impression here.

Aerrin glances up briefly, a bit surprised, and then straightens as her pants are appropriately rolled. ""Goodness, dear,"" she answers with a chipper smile. ""Next time come knock on my door. I even let Xorvian do that."" She shoots a quick glance at said Xorvian, primarily to catch his reaction, and then wades into the shallows to scrub the dirt from under her fingernails.

Xorvian's reaction takes the form of a cynical quirk to the corner of his mouth and an arched brow cast after the /older/ Healer, but the verbal snap that might be expected doesn't come.  Instead, he mutters a, ""Brelle."" by means of greating to the /younger/ Healer in question, and resettles his weight onto his left leg.

Brelle accepts the mutter as her rightful due -- it /is/ Xorvian -- and turns something of a strained smile on the masterhealer. ""Been too busy settling in and trying to get started even to do that much, honestly . . . and knocking on masters' doors wasn't always proper in my last few Turns at Fort. Got out of the habit. I'm glad to have found you; suppose we need to talk about my posting here. My studies."" Pause. ""Well, when it's not sunset-on-the-beach time.""

Aerrin flicks her eyes upward briefly as she scrubs at her arms. ""I'm aware, thank you. I /do/ read the transfers that come in, and since she looks rather female, I'd assumed Brelle rather than Verme."" She turns her gaze toward Brelle, more firmly, and queries. ""From Boll, was it?"" She straightens and waves a hand with a dismissive expression. ""You'll find we're generally a bit more laid back at Ista,"" she assures Brelle. ""You're welcome to knock any time you like."" Her expression brightens, and she wades back in the direction of the shore. ""Oh, yes! You're a herbalist, aren't you, dear?""

Xorvian makes no effort to disguise or subdue a roll of his eyes, his fingers curling and uncurling in his pockets.  He's focusing *very* pointedly upon the sunset, now.  Sunsets are relaxing.  Yes, very relaxing.  ""Generally.""

Brelle adds helpfully, her voice and mouth aslant with dark humor, ""You can ask Verme about how female I am. When /he/ calls me 'dear,' it's not like your usage, Master Aerrin. Knows his way around Records, though. Good man."" Oooh, surf. She trails after her, hands still swinging at her side. Bye, Xorvian. Have fun brooding upon the raw, cruel nature of the ephemeral world, or whatever. ""I will knock,"" she assures the master, ""and yes, I trained in herbalry, although I'm hoping to shift my specialty slightly. A collaboration? I was hoping we could talk. He--"" she jerks a polite chin back at the man ""--suggested it. Very good advice.""

Aerrin sends a sharp glances toward Xorvian, and her lips purse. There's also a subtle change in posture as the Master braces herself for what is almost inevitably going to be a fight, despite the smile she now forces in response to Brelle. ""Did he bother you, then?"" she questions in concern before Brelle continues and Aerrin finds herself on sandy ground again. Her eyes flick in surprise to Xorvian, and then back to Brelle. ""Did he? Well. Then we'll have to talk, for sure.""

Xorvian is perfectly happy where he is, and not particularly upset by the fact that the distance between him and the dynamic Herbal duo is gradually increasing, either.  Therefor he doesn't move, following them with his glare and a faint scowl until they're out of his listening range.

""Verme, Master? He didn't bother me, no; seems harmless, and I can handle myself."" Brelle looks it, too, square and compact as she is, even in the pretty, blousy clothing she's wearing on this fine evening. Xorvian's scowls can't even touch her, though she does float a thoughtful look back towards him after that chin-jerk of hers. ""He used to be my instructor,"" she continues solemnly to Aerrin, of their out-of-range third here. ""I'd rely on his advice on this, and now I've found you, so it worked, right? I'll thank him, don't worry. Respect where respect is due.""

Aerrin nods once, briskly. ""Good to know then, dear, good to know."" She blinks once, twice, and brushes her hands absently against dirt-stained pants. ""Verme did? At Fort?"" she questions, and then glances over her shoulder at the other journeyman. ""Or Xorvian?""

Xorvian continues to brood and glower to himself.  He's very good at it, and it's not like the sun is going to go all stiff and snippy if he looks at it the wrong way.  A glance is, however, spared back after Aerrin and Brelle once he feels eyes on him.

Brelle doesn't go stiff and snippy, but then, she's new here. Plenty of time for proper indoctrination into the ways of dealing with /him,/ with -- ""Xorvian,"" she apologetically confirms for Aerrin. ""Turns and Turns ago; basic general healing. Verme was at Fort, too. I've been enjoying the reunions, frankly. Good memories."" She digs a sandalled foot absently into the sand and studies her toes. Hello, toes. ""And coming back here again,"" she muses on an undertone, to herself. ""Would tomorrow morning be a good time to meet, Master? I'm wondering about teaching, and mentoring. . . .""

Aerrin's brows rise slightly. ""/Really/?"" she questions, with obvious surprise. ""You'll have to tell me what you thought of him, then."" Her voice is pitched low enough that Xorvian, should he decide to follow, couldn't hear, and then she bobs her head in a nod. ""Certainly. Were you wanting to get into the teaching schedule this term, then?""

Xorvian hasn't decided to trail after them yet, but as the sun sinks lower and he begins to loose his interest in the rippling line of its reflection on the water, he looks across the beach after them once more, gauging the distance.

Brelle digs her toes in a little more deeply, lifts a wistful half-smile to the masterhealer. ""Don't know, to be honest. I haven't ever taught before -- or, I have, but filling in for sick friends here or there. Wasn't much good; I ... demand too much from the students. Make them follow my leaps and bounds."" She shrugs and removes her foot from fretful, sandy burial. ""We can talk about it, Master? When we talk about..."" Her head inclines slightly to indicate Xorvian.

Aerrin looks positively startled at that. ""Really now! Imagine that. Well. Perhaps we'll find you one class to do this term, or assisting with an upper level, to allow you to adapt, just a bit,"" she suggests. The head inclination earns her an amused look, and then she nods, turning completely around to eye Xorvian for a few backwards steps. She does not, however, address him agan.

Even with the span of beach between them, it's not difficult to make out Xorvian's expression.  He *did* just have his eyes narrowed for Brelle's head inclination, but Aerrin's move is enough to flatten his angular features out entirely - brows low, scowl distinct at a distance.  Terribly, terribly unamused.

How nice for Brelle, then, that her head has its back to Xorvian. Her attention's on Aerrin, anyway, pained as it is. ""I -- of course, Master. I know I should. I will, and I thank you for showing such concern."" Researcher and book-lover she might be, but she can reel off a pat formal statement when needed, and try to smile to seal the deal. Must be that 'Old Hall' Fortian training (is /that/ what happened to the older journeyman? How sad--).

Aerrin is Istan born and bred, and so Brelle's pat answer seems rather /too/ pat to the Master. She takes the time to smile brightly at Xorvian behind them, and then turns to walk forward again and reply to Brelle. ""You don't seem terribly happy with that suggestion,"" she points out.

If she's enjoying the fact that Xorvian is as far away as he is, smiling was probably a bad move.  Turning a mark piece or two in his pocket as he considers the back of both of their heads for a few brief seconds...well.  If Aerrin should turn around again, it will be to see Xorvian moving after them - long legs making for long strides.

Brelle keeps pace. She's an Istan woman, herself, after all; beaches are no problem. Trying to pass off diplomacy, however? Problem. She gives up the attempt, scuffs sand out of her way, and dives in: ""I'm not, Master Aerrin. If it's required of me, as a healer, as a healer of this Hall -- fine."" She draws in a breath through flared nostrils, strides on. ""I accept it. I will do my best. I will not dishonor my calling or my home. Can't promise happiness, however. It's not that easy.""

Aerrin doesn't catch Xorvian's sudden burst of speed - she's too busy watching Brelle with a slight smile of amusement. ""Well, dear, why don't we try  what you /are/ looking for, then? It's generally the best place to start, if we're looking to find a nice compromise between your interests and the Hall's needs.""

Xorvian's approach is going to become audible before too long, for he is not Istan born, and not comfortable at all in the sand, and not doing a very good job of being quiet about it.  At least he isn't glowering any longer, though - a dour but largely unreadable expression having fixed itself firmly into place.  ""Sorry - did I miss something amusing?""

""The thought of me teaching a classroom of apprentices anything,"" Brelle mutters at him blackly, though she angles a brighter, braver look at Aerrin. ""--I want to finish some research. Trauma cases; can get you the references. I want to ... get out of the workroom more. If that means teaching--"" She shrugs, scoots a look back at the man. ""You did it,"" she tells him with a faint smile and arched brows. ""And you were good. I can only try.""

Aerrin lifts her brows just slightly. ""Well... unless you're considering applying to the Hall for permission to work on your Mastery full time, I think you'll be required to teach /something/, my dear. It's most of what we do here, after all."" She glances at Xorvian with brief annoyance for the interruption, though she doesn't comment.

""It isn't like it's particularly difficult.  You write up a syllabus and you follow it."" Xorvian replies to Brelle first, the fact that he's looking at her like she's a moron for thinking otherwise probably not helping very much.  And then, back to Aerrin, ""If you're going to look at me like that, at least say something scathing that I can counter.""

""Thank you, Xorvian,"" Brelle ices back at him and stumps her little legs more firmly into the beach. Ah, sublimation. ""I do value your advice, you know. And, Master, I do know that's required, but I hope teaching might not take up all my time. There's more to life."" Frustration scrapes her voice raw for a few syllables; then she shrugs back into dour detachment and waits for the next volley to fly by.

Aerrin steadfastly ignores Xorvian. Not in small part because she hopes it will annoy him. Brelle gets a sideways glance, and her lips press together slightly. ""You're welcome to apply for exemption to study your Mastery,"" she suggests again, though there's a lack of enthusiasm to her words.

""You're quite welcome."" Xorvian returns rather stiffly, his eyes narrowing at the fact that he's quite clearly being ignored.  A curled lip later, however, he's excusing himself with a mutter and stepping past and around them to continue on for the hall.

Brelle tells Aerrin quietly, ""We could get him to leave the classroom that way, some days, but it had to be done just right. Didn't intend it here, but..."" A shrug, another dig at the inoffensive sand. ""I'm not ready for a master's study,"" comes out with reluctant honesty, ""but thank you for the offer, Master. Let's discuss the teaching this term, when we can. Will worry about -- the rest some other time.""

Aerrin is a bit distracted, now, in part with watching Xorvian stalk off. She turns to nod at Brelle with an absent-minded smile as they climb the stairs to the Great Hall. ""Of course, hon. I think I'm going to have a proper bath now, though, if you don't mind... excuse me."" And then she, too, leaves Brelle, heading for the hold baths.

"event","Still working through Grandon's volumes for the aconite reference; no luck yet. Imagined it, back in Uressa's class? Asked Verme about it when he came into the Records Room. Turns out he could point me to more volumes (Fort doesn't have them!) <em>and</em> he knew Uressa. Friends will win our bets on that one, then; will have to tell them. Could be Snap's first courier trials when he's old enough.

Ended up gossiping a bit about Xorvian. He suggested X. might be interested in me more than I know. Complete bewilderment: why, and why would I care? Suspect Verme is just that way: did keep calling me ""dear,"" but seems harmless enough. Enjoy having another researcher to talk with!

Have to find Master Aerrin. Will go wander the halls purposefully and hope to trip over her.

Logfile from Brelle.

Records Room
This is a dust-free room that is always at a constant temperature due to being built deep within the cliff.  This keeps the materials within preserved longer.  Right next to the door is a sturdy, worn desk suggesting it's as old as the room sits with glowbaskets on top for use by researchers who come in here looking for a solution or technique forgotten.
Shelves have been dug into the walls to store books, scrolls, and wherhides.  Wooden shelves are built in the center of the room as needed.  You find that the written material has been grouped in the shelves according to topics.
Set between the shelves are tables with really old, sturdy, worn chairs pushed underneath, ready for healers to use... [look closer]
You see Basic First Aid, Waterbirths - A Study, Generic Healer Notebook, Herbal Therapy, Sudanna's Book of Lamaze, Nerak's Cabinet Project, Physical Therapy - An Introductory Guide, and fly here.
You notice 2 people asleep here.
Verme is here.
--

Brelle sits at one of the old tables in an old, old chair with even older hides stacked neatly in front of her. They don't seem so aged that she can't be handling them, at least, because she certainly is: taking each off the stack for inspection and then deposit on a new, smaller stack at her elbow.

Verme has a stack of his own hides tucked under one arm, while he's carrying a sheet of paper with scribblings in his less-than-legiable handwriting in the other. He's not much for looking where he's going. Why bother, when he could spend the time walking /and/ reading instead? Amazingly, he manages to circumvent several tables and chairs while reviewing his notes.

On the next round of selection/inspection/rejection, Brelle looks over to fix on the source of motion, and then she smiles, albeit with a busy reader's weariness. ""Verme? Look out for that chair right there -- oh, you missed it, never mind. Come for some research, too?""

Verme is an old hand at this, after all. Distraction and focus in one strange package. He lowers his notes and hefts his hides, and finally settles a distracted smile on Brelle. ""Brelle! Hello there, my dear! Research, of course, of course, what else?"" He shoves his glasses further up the bridge of his nose with a forefinger and squints down at her as he approaches. ""What are you working on, then?""

Brelle manufactures a little chuckle. ""Trying to track down references on the use of aconite in certain trauma cases. I was sure I remembered it in some of Grandon's work that I studied as a senior apprentice, but I'm not finding it here. His work wasn't all that fashionable, though, even when he was alive, and I /could/ be misremembering."" She regards her stack with a mix of frustration and curiosity. ""It has to be /some/where; I'll track it down eventually. You?""

Verme lowers his hides to the table next to Brelle and moves to hover, perhaps a bit uncomfortably close in the way of academics who are far more interested in the research at hand than in personal space. ""Oh, Grandon, yes! I think I recall what you're looking for... which volume do you have, my dear? I believe he added some later, and not every copy has them."" He pauses to quirk a smile at her. ""Not all that popular, as you say. A wonder that there's more than one of them, given how dreadfully dull his writing is.""

Ash glides in from the Healer Great Hall.

Brelle assures him, ""Oh, you don't have to tell /me/: I had an instructor who was just cracked-shell for the man, and insisted we read as much as we could before a master stepped in."" She looks up then with a more relaxed smile; if Verme's hovering too close, as academics do, her academic self doesn't seem to be minding. ""Does this Hall have his later volumes, then? Or do you think I'm on the wrong track entirely? I'm still getting used to the system here.""

Mau blinks in from ::between::!

Verme chuckles lowly. ""Ah, well, they do exist,"" he affirms, and asks, ""Who was your instructor then, dear?"" He straightens finally, and lowers himself into a seat next to Brelle. ""Oh, I'm certain they do, of course. It's why I'm here, myself. The herbalry texts here are in many ways superior to those at Fort. Of course, it's far easier to do research on the subject when the herbs are available year round, you know."" He pauses to give Brelle a cheeky wink, and spreads his notes on the table in front of him. ""You could spend turns just reading them all.""

Brelle politely moves her piles around to make more room for his, then angles her chair back to let her slouch at a more conversationally convenient angle. ""Instructor? Oh, shards, it was Senior Journeyman Uressa. D'you remember her? She had those beautiful blue eyes that could turn into ice in a heartbeat; I think she practiced it. I'll /bet/ she did, actually, in a mirror in her room. Ha! Anyway,"" she continues, sitting up a little with a glance at the hides before them, ""I /am/ enjoying the texts here; it's mostly why I came here.""

Mau suddenly disappears ::between::!

""Ooh, Uressa. I /do/ remember her,"" Verme answers with obvious fondness, and a twinkle in his eye that might suggest a bit more history than mere instructing. He sighs softly and nods. ""She /did/ have the lovliest eyes, didn't she?"" He blinks and comes firmly back to Brelle with a smile. ""Is it? Are you working on your Mastery then, my dear?""

Brelle's brows go up; her voice goes down. ""You ... didn't, Verme. Did you? I never heard that she ever -- oh, I /have/ to write a few letters to old friends. I think I've lost some bets."" Grinning, she rests her cheek against a hand on elbow's prop to the chair arm and regards him a little archly. ""I'm not working towards mastery, no, just trying to tidy up loose ends from research I did Turns ago. /However,/ I think I'm rather more interested now in other discussions. For example: what other instructors of mine you knew.""

Verme looks entirely innocent - an entirely genuine, as well. ""My dear, I was at the Fortian Hall for a good many years. I'm certain I knew most of them, and many who are now your peers,"" he points out easily. ""Xorvian, for example. I remember when that boy was promoted. A bit of a thing, it was. He's a few turns on me, of course, and I still managed my rank before him."" A bit of shameless, matter-of-fact boasting from the Senior Journeyman, and apparently everyone ranked lower than Verme qualifies as 'boy'.

""Xorvian,"" Brelle repeats. Her amusement's faded into her regular stern aloofness, at least for the moment. ""Mm. Did you? Did he care that you went first?""

""You'd have to ask him that, my dear,"" Verme returns with a twinkle in his eye as he leans toward her conspiratorially. ""Good luck getting a decent answer out of him, of course. Xorvian always has been a bit too stuffy for my tastes. No idea of fun, that one.""

Who can resist a twinkle? Not the good Uressa, apparently! Her former student might be of tougher stuff, but even Brelle has to smile a little. ""Yes, that's exactly it: I /could/ ask him, and right now he owes me a question answered, but will I ever get it? Not in a form I can use. I had him for basic general healing, you know, and I don't know that he's changed too much. I was younger then, though."" She thins her lips in a thoughtful grimace. ""And now he's ... stuffy, as you said. Snappish, too. Aren't we a fun bunch here.""

Verme just has that way about him. Of course. His brows raise and his expression looks truly shocked for a moment. ""Did you, my dear? And what an experience /that/ must have been. I can hardly imagine. Xorvian, teaching basic healing. Indeed. And this was at Fort?"" He shakes his head with a low 'tsk', and then tosses Brelle another wink. ""Too stuffy entirely. You and I ought to do what we can to fix that, don't you think? All these fantastic beaches, and the gardens.. absolutely no excuse to be in a bad mood at Ista.""

Brelle snorts, she does. Still reclining against her propped hand, she shrugs the other shoulder. ""If you want to be the one to suggest a frolic on the beach to Xorvian, I will be happy to stand in the background and nod supportively. I'm newer than you here, after all."" So there.

Verme's smile twinkles just a bit. ""I think we can leave Xorvian at home and keep the beach to ourselves, don't you?"" he suggests. ""He does seem a bit of a damper on most situations, doesn't he?""

Now Brelle's eyes narrow into slits of maybe-just-a-little-amused darkness. ""Ourselves? Everyone but Xorvian, do you mean, or just you and me? He's a damper, all right, and let's not invite him if he's going to stalk and flick those long fingers of his around peremptorily ... but I do find him interesting in conversation. He's a challenge, and I respect that.""

Verme leans back just a touch, and his smile remains. ""We'd have to see what the mood is, I'm sure,"" he answers cheerfully. His eyes light with interest as he regards her. ""Do you, my dear? Have you conversed with him at length since you arrived, then?""

Brelle shakes her head. ""No, only a couple random encounters in the lounge. We did have a longer talk not long after I arrived. I don't think I interested him much, and I don't know that it's not mutual, if you know what I mean."" She pauses, considers. ""He did tell me to talk with Master Aerrin about my studies here, and I've yet to do that. I've been too busy playing in here,"" and she waves a little gesture at the lovely, lovely Records.

""He gave you useful advice? I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't more interested in you than you think, my dear,"" Verme teases with a smooth smile. ""Ah, yes. You ought to, really. I've heard lovely things, though I haven't gotten to talk with her yet myself, either."" He pauses, and leans forward toward Brelle again. ""What is it you're working on then? Finishing up some earlier research, you said?""

Madame blinks in from ::between::!

""Interested in me? Why?"" Brelle sounds, and looks, blankly baffled. ""I don't know why he would be; we aren't even in the same category of discipline, let alone personality. Are we? Anyway,"" and she shakes her head firmly to move on, ""yes, I do need to find her, and I will. I'm working on improving certain herbal therapies for prolonged trauma: amputations, severe physical and emotional stress, and so on. I hope to tie up research on that and then ... find something better to do with my skills."" She frowns, gaze abstracted. ""Something more appropriate for them, that is. I'm not sure how to put it.""

""My dear, I think you've been hiding in your books far too long,"" Verme points out with an easy and slow smile before moving easily along. ""Oh, looking to add a specialty, perhaps?"" he quetsions with interest. ""I've considered that, but I do think I'd best pause with dentistry and herbalry for a bit, really. Do you have any idea where you might move to?""

Brelle eyes him. Yes, she does, but she does not pursue this line of thinking he's got running. Ahem. ""Specialty, I suppose, or else a shift away to something else. A collaboration in some other specialty: a blend. You combine dentistry and herbalry? How does that work for you?""

Verme spreads his fingers across his notes and nods heartily. ""Oh, quite well, my dear, /quite/ well. They're quite related, after all - herbalry works well with just about anything. I'm hoping to find better ways to prevent decay, you know, rather than treat it. I'm certain we can improve on that.""

""Decay,"" is Brelle's thoughtful reply. ""I hadn't thought about that, but ... mm. I like it. Prevention is better than curing, isn't it? Do you work with others at the Hall on that?""

Verme shakes his head slightly, and his fingers close over his notes a bit posessively. ""I tend to work best alone, I'm afraid,"" he reveals in an apologetic tone. With a gaze that's less than apologetic. So there's a hint of seriousness /there/, at least.

Brelle nods, all solemnity herself. ""I'm the same way; I quite understand. It's all right. Some of us are just that way, eh?""

""It seems so, my dear, it seems so."" Verme shuffles a bit, and then scoots his chair backward and stands. ""Speaking of, I'd best get to mine, or I'll never have time for that beach, will I?"" Another teasing wink - he seems to be fond of those - and he collects his hides up. ""I'm certain I'll see you about.""

Brelle responds, amused once more, ""If nothing else, you might see me out on the beach. Good day to you, Verme, and thanks for the talk.""

Verme inclines his head briefly. ""Likewise, my dear, likewise,"" he answers, and disappears into the stacks.

"event","Ran into Verme from Fort in the lounge this afternoon. Fellow researcher; had hides with him. Will have to get reacquainted! He can show me around the local archives. Likely source for good discussions, too.

Lounge also had a young junior apprentice with an even younger fire-lizard. Latter made some mess with Verme's hides. Told apprentice that we'd have to get them trained. Hope I haven't just signed myself up for interminable sessions in a small room full of loud brats, winged and otherwise. Trying to be helpful; shouldn't do that.

Xorvian again. Pale and cranky. Might be his standard mode, though. Left him to it. Finally tracked down some more furniture; now trying to make it all fit harmoniously, or at least without injuring me wherever I turn.

Logfile from Brelle.
--------------------
Healer Lounge
This is a very cozy room where Healers often spend their free time relaxing, talking, and participating in a little recreation.  Dotted about the room are small tables and big comfy looking chairs that are great for sitting down and talking in.  Also there are tables set up around the room with chairs set at them, to be used for studying, or any other activity that might need the support of a table.
In one wall is the doorway that leads into the Healer Great Hall, and the rest of the Hall.  Other doorways are quietly recessed around the room, leading off to healer quarters.  One leads to the Apprentice Dorms, while another goes to the hallway that houses the rooms of Journeymen and Masters.
You see Corwin, Apprentice Dart Board, Ubiquitous Apprentice, and Klah here.
Trevor is here.
--

Trevor meanders in from the apprentice dorm, his arms full of hide scrolls and his little hatchling brown firelizard sitting on his shoulder.  The firelizard is poking at Trevor's ear and the poor Junior Apprentice, his arms burdened, is unable to stop the pest.  Noticing Brelle, he makes his way over to the Journeywoman.

Verme has arrived.

Trevor is making a B-line for Brelle, his arms stuffed with scrolls and an irate-seeming hatchling nibbling on his ear.

Brelle has perched on a chair arm to untangle her own young brown fire-lizard from her neck. She is doing so grimly, intently, and ever-so-politely, without so much as a single curse, even as he squawks and flaps a wing over her face. ""Go,"" she tells him firmly, staring right into those beady spinning eyes. ""Go /home./ Go. --How I will ever train you, you blasted creature, I have no idea-- Oh. Hello."" This, to Trevor, still with half a face full of fire-lizard.

--
Trevor
Two dark-brown, almost black eyes per out at your from under a tussled head of hair so dark as to be almost pitch.  A firm set to his mouth and eyes tells you that he is wary and, possibly, even wild.  An overall scrawny build finishes the portrait of a barely-tamed, fell young man.
A slightly-used tan wherryhide vest overlays a simple blue shirt which leaves Trevor's scrawny arms exposed to the elements.  Utilitarian leggings of some comfortable, flowing material cover his legs and simple herdbeasthide shoes keep his feet well protected from the elements.  Trevor wears Trevor's Listening Tube around his neck. A brown firelizard is perched on his shoulder.
A simple knot of purple and white adorns his shoulder, indicating him as a Healer Junior Apprentice.
He is a teenager of about 14. He is awake and looks alert.
--

Verme enters from the stairs above with his arms full of hides and his hair a bit sadly messy. Sticking to one side and the other, really. His glasses slip further down his nose with each step, and he shrugs his armful carefully in order to shove them back up with a careful shoulder. That done, he finally settles his gaze on Brelle and Trevor. ""I say,"" he greets with a smile. ""Could one of you give me a hand here, do you think?""

--
Verme
No taller than 5'9, Vermes dowdy clothing tends to bag off his lean frame, the dusty tan of his suede coat marked and worn, with some of the stitching clearly pulling loose around his left shoulder and the darker patches of brown sewn over the elbows. Thin, lightly lined features and faded beryl eyes are friendly enough, the energy that snaps behind them subdued somewhat by the thick wire-rimmed glasses perched over the bridge of an unremarkable nose, while a thinning patch in the back of his neatly combed ginger hair is more honestly indicative of his age. Even at a glance, he seems to be the sort that needs to be in constant motion, with his fingers often working at the buttons of his coat, or a foot tapping out a poorly maintained beat.
He is an adult of about 38. He is awake and looks alert.
--

Trevor's near-black eyes flicker between Verme and Brelle, apparently appreciating that none of them are in any better position than him.  ""Errr,"" he tries lamely, his firelizard now starting to get a good chuck of ear between its needle-sharp teeth.

Brelle finally gets her Snap sent off in an outraged blink to /between,/ and then she can give the poor boy a brief smile and murmured ""don't worry about it"" before crossing to Verme's assistance. ""I'm here, I'm here, sorry about that -- well, what do you have here, sir?"" She's eyeing the hides with no little intrigue, and envy.

Verme shuffles some of the hides to Brelle's arms and gifts her with an easy smile and a relieved sigh as he finally frees a hand and manages to settle his glasses properly on his nose. ""Ah, well, research, of course,"" he answers to Brelle. ""What else? Perhaps daring tales of rogue renegades on the high seas?"" He winks at her, and carries his load to a table to deposit it.

Trevor's stack of hides finally hits a nearby table as he loses his patience with the brown firelizard on his shoulder.  Turning to the creature, the scolds it soundly as he holds his fingers to the bitten section of ear, staunching the small amount of bleeding there.  Clearly not discerning sarcasm, he turns with wide eyes to Verme and says, ""Renegades on the high seas!?  Where, sir?""

""Research is quite enough for me,"" the journeyman comments with distinct amusement. ""Have we met? I'm Brelle, newly in from Boll, and if you have access to hides like these, I might need to make your acquaintance-- Oh, did he /bite/ you?"" She eyes Trevor. ""You need to control him better than that, or he'll be biting until the day you die, I'll bet.""

Verme wasn't being sarcastic, exactly. Joking, surely, but not sarcastic. ""Why, on the high seas, I imagine, my boy,"" he responds to Trevor with a jovial smile. Hides settled down, he turns to give Brelle a more considering gaze. His eyes narrow thoughtfully in a struggle to place her face more precisely. ""Brelle.. Brelle. Now tell me where I know that name from, my dear. In from Boll, you say? I've just arrived myself, from the main Hall, of course."" He gives the piles of hides a short wave and smiles broadly. ""For that very reason. Some of the best herbal texts anywhere, my dear, in the records rooms here."" His eyes flick to Trevor, and then to his 'lizard. ""Too true, that,"" he agrees ruefully.

An expression possibly resembling hero-worship graces Trevor's face as Verme confirms his suspicions.  ""Wow!"" he exclaims, wholely oblivious to both Brelle and Verme's admonishments about his hatchling, who is now sitting docilely on the stack of hides Trevor carried in, poking through them and making a small mess.

Brelle surreptitiously edges towards that messy pile. If she can just get her hands on the hides before anything untoward happens... ""Herbal texts?"" she swings around on Verme with a rising smile, and now seems to see him for the first time. ""Oh! Yes, I think we ran past each other in the archives a few times at Fort. Verme, is it? You'll have to tell me how the old Hall is doing; I haven't been back in Turns. Obviously,"" she muses for Trevor's benefit, ""Ista has the very latest and best in terms of renegades texts, but I do miss Fort all the same.""

Verme's eyes linger on Trevor's 'lizard for a moment. ""Watch him, m'boy,"" he advises. ""You ruin those hides, you'll be responsible for copying them over. And who wants to be doing that when you've such lovely beaches here, eh?"" he questions with a wink before he follows Brelle toward the pile. ""Oh, it's moving along, as always. I find that the climate becomes more difficult with every turn, however. I'm terribly afraid I'll find my bones creaking before long."" All his thirty-eight turns must be wearing on him. That, or he's joking again. 

Brelle tries to save some of those hides, answering Verme distractedly as she does. ""The climate there, you mean? Yes, I don't know that I ever got used to the snows, and I was there for only six Turns or so, here and there. Did you live there your whole time until now?"" She darts him a small apologetic look. ""I don't remember, if you've told me. Been busy moving, settling in...""

""Oh, absolutely,"" Verme replies. ""If this is winter in Ista, I do believe I may never leave."" He gives Brelle another wink, and one hand settles atop his beloved hides. ""Yes, yes. Or nearly so. I was posted away a few turns in my youth, but everything of significance was at Fort, of course.""

Trevor's attention is turned back to the stack of hides he brought in.  He lets out a little squeak of terror as he sees his firelizard gnawing on the corner of one.  Poking at the brown, he forces it offer the pile of hides and sits down at the table, rifling through the hides for other signs of damage.

""Of course,"" Brelle agrees gravely with his pronouncement. ""--Thank you, Apprentice! They really are terrors, the beasts. I hope there wasn't too much damage done?"" Her tone is bland enough not to imply that /some/one will be doing some copying if so. She's a polite one, she is.

""Oh, they're not so bad,"" Verme disagrees easily. ""It's just a matter of training the little beasts, you know. Takes a bit of time and dedication, of course.

Trevor groans as he spots a few hides which will clearly need to be copied in the near future.  ""Oh Shards, Journeyman, I'ma sorry!  This'll be the third copyin' assignment this sevenday!  I don'ta know how ta train 'im!  'e just runs off and does 'is own thing and I don'ta know how to control 'im!"" Trevor bemoans his fate, eyeing the little hatchling despondently.

Brelle looks sympathetic, but -- well, she /is/ a journeyman. And her own rigid, stern self, more's the pity. ""Verme's right about time and discipline. Look, I'm in the same boat right now with mine. Maybe we could have a little class, you and me and whoever else is stuck with one, and we can sort it out together. I haven't gotten any teaching assignments yet, after all,"" she adds with some humor.

""More time to research, my dear,"" Verme responds to Brelle, with regards to the lack of teaching assignments. He glances from one to the other, and begins to restack his hides, a bit more carefully this time. ""Which, really, I ought to get back to. A pleasure stopping to speak to you both, of course.""

Xorvian stalks in from the Journeymen and Masters Hall.

For the first time today, you see a look of hope and happiness cross Trevor's face as he looks up at Brelle.  ""Oh, could we, Journeyman!  I know Fasulkad was having some problems with 'is.  It's all this lot of Master Aerrin's gold- maybe somethin's wrong with the lot of 'em,"" Trevor speculates, warily eyeing his firelizard as it hops across the table on some mission of mischief.

Brelle lights a smile for Verme. ""We really will have to catch up soon, now that we're both here. The pleasure was ours."" And back to Trevor, brisk again: ""Well, then, it sounds as if there's need, isn't there? I don't think there's anything wrong with them that time and training won't cure, though. The young do need their discipline.""

Trevor nods eagerly to Brelle and snatches up his brown, ""Ye hear that?  Ye're gonna get some training!""  He picks up the scrolls on the desk- he'll have to copy them later- and heads off to the dormitory on some unknown assignment.
Trevor walks to the Apprentice Dormitory.

Verme nods once at Brelle, smiles brightly, and then, with better-arranged hides, start out for the record rooms again. ""Of course, my dear. Sometime soon."" And then he's off. 

Xorvian was, shock of tremendous shocks, up late altnerating between cramming for an exam and grading papers.  Or up far later than he already generally is, anyway - the circles under his eyes and wan look about him working to suggest that he's probably not in the best of moods as a result.  Not that he's ever really in the best of moods.  A stack of hides dropped heavily onto an unoccupied table, he doesn't acknowledge Trevor in passing.  Or Verme.

And Brelle? Brelle, who's standing with arms akimbo staring after Trevor, the smile for Verme's passing fading quickly into her frown -- ""Oh, I /am/ an idiot,"" she mutters. Which leads her to studying Xorvian: to address or not to address?

Verme has disconnected.

Xorvian isn't making the decision particularly easy - his glare carefully averting down onto his hides to avoid provoking unwanted attention.  Were it not for the fact that he'd have to climb stairs to get there, his ass would probably be up in the more secluded study lounge, but for now, here he is, dragging a chair out for himself and trying not to yawn.

No, of course, far be it from Xorvian to make things easy for anyone ... and Brelle, alas, is no sunshine-and-sweetener ingenue to bat her lashes and breathe whispery words to entice him out of this mood. Vomit. So, she does what she does naturally: confront. ""Want some klah, Xorvian, or should I get something stronger?""

""Bugger off.""  Vomit indeed.  Xorvian is obviously not Mr. Sunshine either - long fingers splaying irritably across the top-most hide as he moves to drag it closer to him.

Brelle responds, ""No problem here; I shall. Just one request, if I may: be nicer to the apprentices if any more come through here? They're good kids, and it's not their fault.""

""They'll know better than to bother me if they have any semblance of a brain rattling around in their skulls."" Xorvian grumbles, shoulders hunched slightly against the suggestion before they straighten themselves back out to match the hard lines of his suit.

Brelle snorts. ""And the ones that don't will be culled out of the population, doing all of us a favor."" She pushes off from her lean against her own table. ""Hope your day improves; I leave you to it.""

""Precisely.  Have a good afternoon."" The last tagged on semi-automatically, Xorvian blinks hard and gets to reading - one hand already fumbling within the confines of his suit for a pen to start making corrections.

"event","Long day settling in. Still much to unpack, and where is all my furniture, anyway? Good apartment, though; looks out on the sea. (Need to write home, let family know I arrived safely. They'll want to visit if they can. Must discourage that.) Will hunt down a steward or such tomorrow morning. At least there's a cot.

Starting to read through the research materials I brought with me from Boll: copies of scrolls, the books I bought or copied myself, and of course the compendium. Will I have to chance to return to my senior-apprentice research? Hope so. Add it to the list of questions for whomever I'm supposed to consult on my personal matters.

Speaking of: met Xorvian, teacher from my apprentice days, and got an answer to <em>that</em> question. Master Aerrin?  Track her down tomorrow, too, along with the steward-or-such. Man didn't look well, but same old attitude, I think. Hard to recall now, through the veils of age-withered memory. Mentioned a buzz, a heart condition. Alcohol? Contraindicated; surely not. But not my concern. Good many Turns my senior, obviously tough, can just take care of himself, as I'm doing.

Accidentally Impressed a fire-lizard a few days ago. Not pleased. Must train it well to get some use out of it. Size: small, promising below-average measurements at maturity. Build: wiry, sharp. Color: brown. Name: Snap. Interesting to feel the little waves of contact between us. Wish I could do a few experiments.

Logfile from Brelle.
--------------------
Healer Lounge
This is a very cozy room where Healers often spend their free time relaxing, talking, and participating in a little recreation.  Dotted about the room are small tables and big comfy looking chairs that are great for sitting down and talking in.  Also there are tables set up around the room with chairs set at them, to be used for studying, or any other activity that might need the support of a table.
In one wall is the doorway that leads into the Healer Great Hall, and the rest of the Hall.  Other doorways are quietly recessed around the room, leading off to healer quarters.  One leads to the Apprentice Dorms, while another goes to the hallway that houses the rooms of Journeymen and Masters.
You see Corwin, Apprentice Dart Board, Ubiquitous Apprentice, and Klah here.
Xorvian is here.
--

Brelle has sunk herself into one of the overstuffed chairs and is flipping through a large-leaved book on her lap. The tiny brown fire-lizard on her shoulder is amusing himself with chewing on her ear (until she jerks her head away), her hair (likewise), and her shirt's collar (which she ignores).

--
Brelle
She stands short and sturdily square, grounded in the confidence born of brawny physique and self-reliant psyche. Glossy black hair curls close to her head, a no-nonsense backdrop for browned skin and darkly bottomless eyes; her limbs fold as tightly to her body with doughty energy and purpose. This blunt facade yet owns contradictory and even wistful grace notes: the sensitive curves of blushed lips and high, fine eyebrows; the inquisitive lilt of her Istan alto; and the incautious yearnings of a unflagging seeker.
Good, sturdy castoffs keep her cool in stone warrens: a long-sleeved linen shirt, worn to beige comfort and held together by cork buttons; dark wherhide trousers a little too large; and matching shoes that show their long use in shininess at toe and ankle. Fancy has tied a pale pink scarf about her neck and looped brass rings in her earlobes.  A brown firelizard is perched on her shoulder.
Her knot marks her as a journeyman at Ista Healer Hall.
She is a young adult of about 27. She is awake and looks alert.
--

""Stop asking me questions and try doing some bloody research for once, Athos."" Xorvian is in the process of snapping as he strides in from the direction of the main hall, the junior apprentice at his heels looking somewhat abashed.  And upon the sight of Brelle, somewhat embarassed as well.  A few seconds of mumbled acceptance later, the apprentice is off, and Xorvian is left to slouch into a chair of his own - a pair of fingers immediately pried under his starched collar to loosen it as his long legs stretch out before him, and his head thumps back against the chair itself.  Only then does he allow his cold glare to slide over onto Brelle.  ""Who are you?""

Her fire-lizard squawks. She looks him into silence, gentled by a hand on his back around which he curls while the woman ripostes with a glare of her own. Carefully she closes her book around a finger's mark and answers, ""Brelle, journeyman healer late of Southern Boll, newcomer to this hall if not this island, and a little busy at the moment. May I help you with something?"" Her dark eyes slide after Athos's exit. ""With an apprentice, perhaps?""

""No.  Why?  Do I look as if I require assistance?"" One foot is dragged back under his chair.  Then the other.  The fact that she's 'a little busy' doesn't seem to phase him.  ""Were you sent over for a particular reason?""

--
Xorvian
Lightly tanned, angular features are dominated by an aquiline nose and expressive brows that tend to press low over his icy grey eyes, a combination that serves to make him appear eerily intelligent and cold - the deep frown lines carved in around his mouth and brows doing nothing to soften the severity of his countenance.  His jaw bearing the neatly kept salt-and-pepper whiskers of a short beard, he has recently had his increasingly grey (once raven) hair trimmed - the shortish cut generally neatly styled, with silver having clearly won the battle for his temples and short sideburns, and darker charcoal steadily replacing the black that's managed to survive thus far.  Fairly tall and wiry in build, he barely reaches 6'2, with long fingers and rather large feet that seem to balance out his lanky figure while contradicting his staunch posture.
Relatively new and clearly expensively tailored for the tall healer's frame, Xorvian's suit is a light, smoky grey, with the tweed  it's crafted out of allowing for variations of darker and lighter color from collar to cuffs.  The fitted vest beneath his jacket is made from the same material, and is buttoned neatly over a crisp white dress shirt - the entire ensamble (shined black dress shoes included) a reflection of his staunch, scholarly attitude.     
The knot on his shoulder identifies him as a Healer Journeyman at the Ista hall.
He is an adult of about 42. He is awake, but seems rather distracted.
--

Brelle shrugs her way back into the chair, deeper into the softness, and lets her smile drag forth demurely. ""No, I'm sure you're fine. Xorvian, right? I had you for basic general healing at Fort."" Her pleasant tone allows how it was /such/ the experience, too (for such a knock-kneed ingenue as she, adds her wide-eyed gaze). ""I came of my own accord, by request. You?""

""Yes.  Xorvian.  I was forced to come four turns ago when Fort decided that it could no longer trust Ista to keep its act together without constant supervision, along with two other Journeymen.  Privately, however, I've always felt that it may have been an attempt on Fort's part to punish Ista for being ignorant."" Forcing a thin smile at that, Xorvian wrings his long fingers around the arm rests at his side, still slowly but surely working out the various kinks that have a tendency to work into place over the course of the day.  ""That must have been a long time ago.""

""Eleven, twelve Turns?"" Another shrug, and Brelle rests her free hand on the book's cover while she watches him placidly now. ""Long enough, but I retained the tuition you offered, at least. So, Fort punishing Ista--"" she matches his thin smile ""--and punishing you? 'Forced,' you said....""

""I'm sure they wouldn't describe it that way."" Xorvian drones, brows lifted for the assumption.  ""Anyway, there's really no point in complaining anymore.  I've been doing it for the last four turns and I'm still here.""

Brelle assures him, ""I was just curious. If you're here and happy, well, what else matters? You /look/ happy.""

""Yes, well.  That's because I'm still working off a slight buzz, and I cannot afford to commit myself to dwelling within endless pits of lightless dispair on account of a heart condition.  What did you say your name was again?"" If he's happy, it's a dour happiness - the sort that definitely makes it seem as though he's more given in to inevitably than celebrated it.

Brelle's mouth tips up at one corner; it's not entirely based in amusement. Or indulgence. ""Brelle. I think lightless despair might suit you well, actually, but I'm sorry to hear about your heart,"" she offers from the depths of chair and watchfulness. ""Nothing too serious, I hope?""

""Ah, yes.  Brelle.  And it does.  But I have the craft to think of."" Because it really just...desperately needs him to be teaching that basic general healing class.  Yes.  ""I wouldn't want to distract them from their duties in the celebration that would inevitably ensue in the wake of my untimely death.""  A stiff, one-shouldered shrug is attributed to the question of how serious it is.  

""We would all,"" murmurs Brelle somberly, studying the book in her lap, ""mourn your passing as befits a healer and a teacher of your stature, sir."" 

Xorvian chuckles weakly at that, a sidelong look cast in the younger woman's direction as he resettles himself in his chair.  ""Yes.  Of course.""

""So."" Brelle transfers her fathomless scrutiny back to the man. ""If your heart, and your buzz, might handle it, could I ask a professional question?""

""I suppose.  Of course, you might be better off asking someone with a set of opinions more in line with the general populace of this particular crafthall."" That said, Xorvian twines his fingers loosely in his lap, and waits.

Successfully derailed by that comment, Brelle sits up a little, chin rising with surprise. ""How do yours differ?"" she stalks intently. Information. Yay!

""It simply does."" Xorvian replies flatly, his brows pressing low over his glare immediately at the question.  ""That wasn't the question, was it?""

""It's a new question,"" counters Brelle, undeterred. ""Would you like me to queue it for after my first one?""

Xorvian nods, just beginning to look a little as if he might have done well to continue on to the upstairs lounge.  ""For now, yes.""

Brelle settles back comfortably once more; her satisfaction is nigh-palpable, furry and dark. ""Thank you, then. My first question is this: I came here to explore different directions in which I might take my specialty, or at least what I do in my specialty, which is herbalry. Who do you think are the best people to approach for discussion on those lines?""

""Aerrin.  Master Aerrin, that is.  Short.  Red-headed.  A woman.  ...Probably."" Sniffing, Xorvian folds his arms across his chest, not particularly pleased with the idea of that other question being brought around once more.  Regardless, he waits for it to come again before he answers.

Brelle affects puzzlement. ""Probably a woman? Has anyone checked to find out for sure?""

""M'ral.  I wouldn't recommend asking him, though.""  Another uncomfortable shift, and then Xorvian is pushing up onto his feet.  ""Well, if that's all, I suppose I should be on my way...""

Brelle stays seated, but her voice follows him up: ""Thank you, that's all on that one. And my second question -- well, I suppose it can wait."" She opens her book and bends a polite smile on the older man. ""Another time, Xorvian. Do take care of yourself, hm?""

""Yes, another time, I'm sure."" Unless he decides to camp out in his room to avoid social contact outside of the voices in his head after he's been boozing.  Thank God Brelle isn't telepathic, eh?  The faintly cynical look in his eyes as he forces himself to return the smile should carry across a similar message, anyway.  ""Have a good evening, Brelle.""

Brelle inclines her head respectfully under the brush of cynicism, even if puzzlement lingers around the edges of her expression. Ah, well. Mysteries will be; can't solve 'em all in one night. ""Thank you,"" and back she goes to her book, opened to the saved page to suck her in once more.

From her insta-rank application:

<b>History</b>
Brelle grew up at Ista Sea Hold as the eldest child of a fisherwoman and a cook. She has a brother riding green at Igen (he hates the desert, but what can you do?) and two more serving as mates (and rivals) on their mother's ship; the youngest child, a sister, has found contentment as a weaver's wife and mother to their many children at Ista Hold. The family is warmly connected, though not especially close, and Brelle misses being among them.

When she had 15 Turns, her parents saved up enough to send her to Fort's Healer Hall in proper fashion for the best possible training, since that was her desire. She followed the standard track, choosing herbalry as her specialty and falling under the mentoring sway of notably eccentric Senior Journeyman Yasti. After Brelle had made senior apprentice and was working towards journeyman, Yasti received a posting to Southern Boll Hold, and off the pair went together, into the jungle, so to speak, and into purer pharmaceutical research: not only what herbs do, but why and how, how they interact, and how to improve their efficacy and realize new applications.

Concerns for Yasti's health, both physical and mental (he's a dear, but dotty), led to a recall back to Fort in time for Brelle's promotion to journeyman with the rest of her Turn-class. She brought with her a compendium of the research she had done under Yasti's aegis, wherein her particular contribution was a modified course of herbal therapy that treats in stages prolonged traumatic shock, helping to restore holistic balance in a third less time than the usual treatments require. The work was accepted into the archives, pending further research, which Brelle hopes to revisit, herself, one of these days.

Her first, and to date only, personal posting was back to Boll, at her request, to take up Yasti's abandoned charge in the stillroom. Over the subsequent Turns, however, she began to miss the pure research she had done in time past, but more than that, she realized that even research was boring her. Was her life to be a succession of small, dark, close-smelling rooms? She's good at what she does, no doubt about it, but she finds little joy in it anymore -- and she does miss her family and her home. Accordingly, she sought and received permission to apply to Ista Healer Hall, where she hopes she might find a new direction, or at least a new polish, for her studies and her career.

<b>Personality</b>
Brelle is a seeker, although she hasn't always known what exactly she's seeking. She was a curious child, always asking questions and getting into one uncertain situation after another. Extricating herself from them taught her self-reliance and confidence in her own abilities; she is even now proud and purposeful, hardly daunted by anything thrown her way.  She remains restlessly inquisitive, though she will hide her most fanciful dreams under a thick, tough facade.

Although she loves her family and has had many friends and good acquaintances, she has always felt somewhat on the outside looking in at their lives. She's a loner by preference; when required to be working or living with others, she shows a competent social grace (and the occasional snap of wicked, earthy humor, thanks to her mother), but the desire to stay on the fringes and observe. She is a healer because she wants to explore the world through its guises (and there's so much to explore!), but her desire to help other people is a little more abstract, removed, than that of many other healers.

She loves to read because she loves to discover and to know. Harpers' songs and tales, however, bore her: her own imagination for filling in the gaps of a story, she feels, is far superior to any ditty set to tune. She would like to start a family as soon as the craft structure allows her; she doesn't have any current candidates for father or husband, but would be content to take a lover and have the child on her own, at least until someone worth sharing her life came along. She prefers her klah as thick and dark as possible, and avoids sweets. They make her jumpy and irritable, and she hates that (too noticeable, and gets in the way of her work)."

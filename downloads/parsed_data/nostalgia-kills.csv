"event","Well well well....it seems I've become bored to the point of writing in this thing again.  Lucky you.

So what the fuck has been going on lately?

Hmmm

Still single...but thats a given.  Im still all about Joanna, and I pretty much let her know I had a thing for her.  I dont think its going anywhere, but Im not stressing it.  Hopefully I'll be able to see her this weekend.

I feel so horrible for her.  She became pregnant again...and broke up with the father of the baby.  Well...she had a miscarrige (for reasons I'll withhold) and shes pretty torn up about it.  This path month as been hell for her...and I just want to be there for her and help her out with whatever she needs.  Shes just so sweet, and I want her to feel comfortable and try to forget about all this mess...

My friend Mandi in VA also got pregnant around the same time Joanna did.  Her boyfriend is currently in Iraq, but he's excited about it, and when he comes home around May or so....they're getting married.  Im really happy for her...Mandi is fucking awesome.  I'll admit though, I think it all moved WAY too fast for her.  Shes such a party girl, and it all just STOPPED.  Now shes preggos and about to get married.  Fucking crazy.  But I wish her the best.

Im currently attending college prep courses...mainly to get the fuck away from my company for awhile.  I cant stand being around these fucks.  And these courses have made me realize how bad my ADD really is, and if I wanted to do college at all, I'd have to get medication for it.  I mean...its fucking BAD.  I cant pay attention for shit.  And my mom tried to tell me I didnt have it..pshh...


5 more months until this is all done for.  Im so excited.  I still dont know if Im going to Cali in April for training or not...we have an assload of new guys, so I dont know if they'll have enough flight space.  But they want all us senior guys to train them up...so we might have to go.  I've taught them a few classes on this and that....hopefully they've learned a little bit from me.  They're gonna need it, because Iraq is no fucking joke.

Im gonna end this now, because I cant think of anything else to say.  Im sure I'll think of something later.

Au revior."

"event","I forgot to mention....I went to the Burning Season show 2 nights ago here in NC.  A few other bands played that were pretty good...cept the first band..they blew ass.

I met some of the members of If Hope Dies at the Subway right across the street.  It was pretty nuts, cuz I was just listening to them earlier that day at the gym.  Craziness.

I brand a friend of mine in my platoon that really doesnt even listen to that music.  A bunch of people were in the pit doing their ""2 step"" hardcore breakdown-style dancing or whatever you want to call it...and my friend ""didnt like one of the guys"", so he was gonna spear him.  I told him if he got jumped for doing that, I wouldnt help him in the fight.  Then he started talking all this shit to me, so I snapped and got in his face and called him out cuz he pissed me off so bad.  Like...right in front of everyone.  The security guard came up and was like ""whoa whoa whoaaaaaa!""  I eventually calmed down, but if he said one more word, I was gonna take him out in the parking lot and beat the shit out of him.

There were barely any people at that show...I guess those bands arent very well known in the Carolinas, because there are too many fucking rednecks and shit here.  But it was still a good time.  AND I FINALLY GOT MY BURNING SEASON CD IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR!  So I was happy.


I got about 4 hours of sleep that night...woke up....did part of a 5 mile ""mud run"" (where you just run through the woods and through puddles of mud and shit), then we had to do ground fighting, and I got slammed pretty hard on my back and now its all fucked up.  It hurts like a fucking bitch.  So yeah...that sucks.

"event","Hmmm...so whats been going on?

Well, last weekend was fucking AWESOME.  I had a lot of fun.

Friday night I hung out with Joanna and a few of her friends.  We went to some house party in Kensington with a bunch of ghetto white-boys.  When I walked in, I was like ""oh god..."" but they were actually pretty chill, so I still had a good time.  hahaha..I went in the kitchen to get a drink, and some slut was giving this guy head in the corner of the kitchen.  HAHAHA...I was like ""um....""

Joanna didnt feel so well during the end of the night...she was pretty drunk.  I thought she was gonna puke...haha...we actually had to pull over once so she could get some fresh air.  Poor Jojo.

After hanging out with her, Im pretty much all about her again.  I guess when Kristie came along, I saw more of a chance hooking up with her than I did with Joanna.  So I guess Kit just kinda pushed Joanna out of my head I guess.  But to be honest, I when I thought about it, Kristie didnt seem like really great girlfriend material.  I mean, shes hot as fuck, and I had a lot of fun with her, but there was just something that wasnt right.  Oh well, I dont have to worry about it again.  

I really cant stop thinking about Joanna...I can't get her out of my head.  She honestly, has to be one of the greatest women I've ever met in my life.  Her personality tops her looks...and thats really hard because shes absolutely gorgeous.  Shes just so much fun to be around and talk to, and has all these amazing traits, and thinks almost like I do.  I'd almost go as far as saying we're pretty ""compatible"", but Im not gonna let myself think that.  A couple of things that happened Friday night led me to believe she might be somewhat attracted to me....but that could have also been alcohol enduced...hahaha.  Im not gonna go into details because its long and confusing...but just certain events led me to think that, and with good reasoning.

I dont know...shes still seeing this guy...they've been seeing each other for months.....but she doesnt technically count him as a ""boyfriend"" she says.  LoL....I dont know what the hell that means.  But if she was single...man...I'd go for it in a split second.  I mean, if I see any chance whatsoever, Im going for it.  Because shes just too amazing not too.  And Im usually not too ballsy or straight forward with women, cuz Im kind of shy, and I dont know what to say to them.  But her...shes different.  I just feel so comfortable around her...shes pretty much all I could ever ask for in a girl.  And she has kind of a shitty past with her ex's, and I dont see how they could have done the things they did to her.  Shes just too sweet.  



Anyway...moving on...

Saturday night was Jenns Bday party...so I finally got to meet her!  Shes very cool, and she has a lot of cool friends I got to meet.  We had a fucking BLAST....everyone was trashed.  We had like...bed jumping contests....me and this dude would jump off one bed and onto another one, then smack into the closet door...HAHAHAHHAA.....this is after a few rounds of beer pong, mind you.  I think we broke the closet door a little.

It was her friend Beths first time drinking, so she got really wasted, passed out, and puked all over herself.  Me and Shawn wrote allllllll over her face....HAHAHAA...it was glorious.  

Shawn and Jenn were pretty much hooked up that night.  I -knew- Shawn would try to hook up with someone.  Despite how much he talks about ""being faithful to Amanada"" and saying that they're ""just on a break"", I know its all bullshit.  I know they broke up for good, and he's just in denial.  Cuz if he was soooooo in love with her......in love with her enough to go buy her a fucking 1500 engagement ring that he COULDNT EVEN AFFORD.....then he wouldnt be hitting on all these other women.  Whatever, he'll fucking learn someday.  He's just such a bullshit liar, and I cant fucking stand it.  So Im just gonna start calling him out on all his lies till he gets mad about it and/or stops lying so much.  You can see right through him..he's bad at it.

Anyhoo...the next day I woke up on the floor with the stiff neck of DEATH.  Jenns friend Jessica was gonna pour water on me to wake me up...but I heard them talking, and I heard her stop right next to me, so I woke up real fast and grabbed her leg.  hahaha

Before we left...I had this great idea to flip over EVERYTHING in the room.  Pictures, furniture, telephones, alarm clocks...EVERYTHING i could.  It was so fucking funny.  The cleaning ladies were right outside our room when we were gonna leave...so we just booked it to the car and left to Dennys.  Jenn asked me what my sausage patty was....she was like ""it looks like a little burger""...HAHAHAHHA OMFG...SHELTERED!!!!!  

After Dennys...we all went out to see ""Hostel"".  A lot of people told me it sucked...but I thought it was pretty good.  There were some NASTY fucking parts in it..I was like ""holy shit EW!"" 

After the movie, we drove Jenn to go pick up her car.  Apparently while we were driving, the manager of the hotel we stayed at called Jenn flipping out because we ""broke everything.""  We were like ""Its not broke!  Just upside down!  Flip it over!""  The guy kept telling Jenn to come back to Waldorf to talk to him, or else he'd call the cops.  She was like ""I cant come, Im too far.""  So he said he was calling the cops.  She was just like ""fine!""  hahahahhahaa

I dont think anything ever happened with that.  At least I hope not.  Fucking hotel losers.

Anyway...Im going to TN with my friend this weekend.  I've been wanting to visit there for awhile now cuz he kept telling me how fun it was and shit...so I was like ""fuck it, lets go.""  If should be a good time...I dont think he'd let me down.  Plus he has an assload of guns we're gonna go out and shoot and stuff.  Helllllllz yeah!

Alright...this has got to come to a close...Im sick of typing."

"event","Hi.

Okay yeah...so Im sorry for the lack of updates...my life isnt too exciting to write about right now...lol

So the situation with me and Kristie (Kit) is over completely.  I found out she has a boyfriend now (she probably wouldnt have told me), so I pretty much went off on her for leading me on....she tried to defend herself...blah blah blah.  Well we dont talk anymore.  I took her name off my buddy list and erased her from my phone.  Out of sight, out of mind, right?

Moving on...

Work is really stressing me out.  We did a fairly long run yesterday (after work, mind you...sort of a punishment thing because a lot of the guys have shitty fitness scores), and I was the only person in my section to keep up.  Im not a very strong runner....but I still had a 280 out of 300 score on my fitness test.  Thats pretty damn good.  I dont feel like I should be punished because other people cant run that fast/do as many pull-ups.  But they keep pulling dumb shit out of their ass for us to do...and since IM in charge of a lot of the guys now, a lot of bullshit is coming down on my shoulders.  I thought it would be a lot better once I picked up Corporal...but Corporal is just another headache in itself.  Im just trying to take it day by day and not explode.  I seriously wanted to shoot myself in the face yesterday...I was so stressed.  They still cant figure out what they're going to do with us ""short timers""....all the guys who are getting out.  Our battallion is scheduled to go to California for a month in April...but I dont know if they're gonna send us to train the new Marines or not.  I heard a rumor that we'll be getting 100 new Marines tomorrow for our whole battallion...that means we'll be getting a few for our platoon, and Im gonna have to train them.  ugh.  Whatever....I get out in July.  Maybe the end of June...because Im gonna try to submit all the leave I have saved up and get out a little early....that would be awesome.

Im also trying to go to these college prep courses in February.  Mostly because I want to get away from the Company for a month.  Then the next month, Im gonna try to get recruiters assistance for a month or so.  That means I'll be in MD the whole time for that....but I still gotta technically ""work"" at the recruiting station.  Gotta dress up in uniform and all that shit =/, but at least I can go home after work every day!  And that would own.

Im like 92% sure Im coming back to MD this weekend.  My buddy is going to carpool with me, so that will save me some gas money since he'll pitch in.  I might (hopefully) see Joanna on Friday night, and Saturday night is Jenns birthday party.  That'll be the very first time I meet her in person!  Shes really cool though...so it should be all good.  I'll just be there by myself and not know anybody...and that would be really ackward.  Sean and the crew are leaving for NY on Saturday morning for Seans birthday.  Im sure they'll have fun.




So heres the breakdown in short:
Women are bitches
I want to get out of the Marines/away from my Company ASAP
Im gonna party like theres no tomorrow this weekend.  Hopefully.  If everything works out.

Oh yeah....and Steve said he can almost positively get me a job with him, and I'll get started off making 18 bucks an hour if I work the overnight shift...and thats fucking awesome.  I can seriously start slapping mods on my car like crazy.  I looooove it.  Oh and by the way, does anyone want to buy a paintball gun?  2003 Angel Speed:  $350 bucks.  I bought it for $950 brand new, and used it like 7 times.   I doubt anyone will want to buy it...but its worth a shot."

"event","So last night was a fucking BLAST.  I went out with Po and Mikey for a night out in Wilmington.  Something I should probably do more often...if I wasnt such a brokeass.  But yeah, it was good times, and Mikey got the hook up with some rum and cokes, so he was just passing them to me all night..hahaha.  We got back at like 4am and I woke up at 7am.  PHOOEY.  

AND HOLY SHIT JENN ACTUALLY FUCKING CALLED ME.  Im starting to think she might actually be a real person!  hahahhaaha <3

It really sucks I have to stay back here for Christmas.  And it also really sucks that I barely have any money.  I was just bumming around today...fuckin blows =/

My mom emailed me and informed me since my dad was really tight on cash, she wont be able to afford the 500 bucks I need to get that race chip for my car.  That sucks too!  Hopefully she can get at least 300 or something, and I guess I'll wind up paying the rest myself.  But I really want it.  Because car modding is like...my new obsession right now.  And I wanna make my little fucker FAST.

I got pulled over on base a few days ago because of my tint job.  What kind of asshole pulls you over just because of your tint?  So he gave me a fix-it ticket, and said if I didnt want to fix it, I could un-register my car on base.  So that exactly what Im going to do....because I'll be damned if I burn another 220 dollars for no fucking reason at all.  That would be the SECOND time because of these fuckers on base.  Fuck them.  I just need to find a place to store my car.  Hopefully my buddy Cody will let me keep it at his place, cuz his is the closest house off base.

So the situation with Kit is weird I guess.  A lot of you agreed with her side of it...and I guess I can see that too.  Im not really even stressing it anymore.  I think she has another guy shes interested in, but she wont admit that to me...which is pretty stupid if you ask me, because we're not even together.  I'd rather people just be straight up with me instead of beating around the bush.  I can handle shit, Im a grown man.  But its whatever, Im not gonna wait around for her.  If I happen to find someone else that ""tickles my fancy"", then Im gonna go for it.  Im not gonna tie myself down for one person if we're not gonna be anything but kissing buddies or some shit...lol

I really cant wait to get the fuck home and see everyone.  It should be fun...I just gotta find ways to scheme some money so I can have some drinking/partying cash.

"event","So fuck it.  I dont give a shit anymore.  I dont fucking care what people think, so if you read this, and you think Im an asshole/stupid/emo/dumbfuck I really could give a shit less.


Yeah, so I have (or had) a thing with Kristie.  I know people spread rumors and shit calling her a slut...and I dont know her that well, so I kept it going until she proved me otherwise.  Thanks for lookin out Jenn, but I have to make my own mistakes.  Ask anyone, I do it all the time.

And thats what it seems like all the time.  A mistake.  I can never make the right call...I always find myself sitting here in the dark all by myself in the end.  Listening to sappy music and drinking alone.  Because I just dont know what else to do.  I fall for people.  Im genuine.  I find good in everyone.  And all the fucking time it comes back to bite me in the fucking ass.  I try to put up my walls, but eventually I build a door for someone to walk though.  Then they destroy me from the inside out.  

Im just so fucking sick of trying.  And I know I've said it a million times.  And I've been hurt a million times.  And I'll probably try it a million times more.  Because thats how I am.  Being single for so long just isnt for me.  Im so sick of hearing ""Dont worry Jon, the right girl will come along.""  What the fuck ever.  Theres always a fucking catch.  Yeah, she might be the right girl, but since Im a Marine, and I dont live in MD at the time, theres just no way it can happen.

Thats basically what Kristie said today.  She was talking about coming to visit me in NC after Christmas.  I said she had to work.  She said she'd take off work.  I said ""Well thats kind of weird since we're not even dating..""  Then she says ""Well if we're not dating then what are we?""  I considered it just ""talking"", but I wanted to be with her.  Then I asked her what she thought we were?  She said ""I'll be with you when you're out of the Marines.""

What the fuck?  How the fuck do you know you'll be with me when Im out of the Marine Corps?  Thats 8 months away.  Whats the point in even keeping this going if we wont even try being together for another 8 months.  Fuck that.  Thats fucking stupid.  Why the hell would you come all the way down to NC to see someone you didnt even feel for?  It doesnt make fucking sense.

The only thing that makes sense is that she's been leading me on.  And Im not a fucking fan of that.

Im just tired of it all.  Every fucking thing.  Im always the mother fucker left out in the cold.  Im always the fucking thrid wheel.  

Maybe theres something Im missing.  Maybe I need someone to make a fucking list of my flaws so I can see them on paper.  Yeah.  Im not fucking attractive.  I know this.  I hear about it every fucking day.  But really, what the fuck am I gonna do about it?  Buy a new fucking face?  Fuck you.  

Everything is just a mess right now.  Im hurt.  I'll admit it.  I was actually happy for a little while, but I wasnt trying to get my hopes up.  But of course, I always lie to myself and fucking do it anyway.  But isnt that what relationships are about?  You gotta take a blind leap.  You have to give it a try.

I just always wind up falling.

So what now?  What do I do?  It's easy for people to say ""just forget about her.""  And I would if I could do that.  I dont know if this is truly the end of it all.  But Im upset.  Because I was happy.  Everytime I'd talk to her I'd be smiling.  Everytime I'd kiss her I'd get shivers all over my body.  Everytime she said ""I miss you"", I actually believed it.

Now I dont know what to believe anymore."

We didnt really do too much...tried watching a movie over at Seans but it didnt work out like we planned...so we just drove around and junk.  I only got to see her for about an hour on Saturday because she was tired from work.

I dont know what the hell is going on between us...shes acting all shady.  She'll text me saying ""I miss you"" and ""I really like you"" and shit like that...but she doesnt act like she wants to be a couple.  I'd give details but I dont feel like putting it all on here.  

Its just pissing me off.  I always tell myself not to get my hopes up...and when things start looking up, and start going good, something always happens to ruin it.  Its not fucking fair.  It always fucking happens to me.

So now Im sitting here in a shitty fucking mood.  Exactly what I needed.  Its just gonna make this week even worse.

And I really fucking LOVE how there was absolutely NOTHING going on Saturday night.  I mean -nothing-.  I called a million fucking people, and no one picks up their phone.  Most of them abuse the ""ignore"" button when I call.  Fuck them.  I fucking hate people.

Just for the mere fact that I never see her, and if I call to try to hang out or set up some kind of plans, she doesnt call me back or just kinda brushes me off.  But she has a guy, so its cool.

Thanksgiving was good.  We went to my sisters moms house for dinner...shes real sweet.  I had a good time...hanging out with the brother-in-law, spending time with my nephew.

The rest of my time off was alright...Friday was just kinda eh...went to some ghetto-people party and almost witnessed 3 seperate fights within a time span of 20 minutes.  Fucking rediculous.

I GOT TO SEE LAUREN THIS WEEKEND!  I havent seen her in over a fuckin YEAR!  God I miss that girl to death...shes so fucking awesome <333

Hung out with Bobby for most of the weekend.  It was cool.  He's my home-skillet.  I never get to see him anymore...its a damn shame.

What you know whats even more fucked up!?  Fucking SHAWN never hangs out with us anymore.  Ever.  He gets off work at 10, and doesnt have to be to work till 2 in the afternoon the next day...and he STILL doesnt hang out.  He's so fucking pussy-whipped, its god damn rediculous.  I mean, his girlfriend is cool and all, and we have NO problem with Shawn bringing her along...but to totally ditch your friends?  Thats kinda fucked.  And he only lives like 4 doors down from Seans house.

Saturday I went out with Kit and we saw Chicken Little....hahahaha....oh my god.  I was so embarrassed just to order the tickets for that shit.  But it was in 3-D!!!!  First time I've seen a 3-D movie since like...the ice age.  I had a good time though...we cuddled a little bit in the theater...it was cute.  Then I went to McD's party...it was fun for awhile...then people started to leave, and I started watching TV and falling asleep on the couch...then out of NO WHERE, McDonalds girlfriend Rachel comes and smacks the fucking SHIT out of me....for no fucking reason!!!!  I swear to god, if she wasnt McD's girl, I would have punched her in the fucking mouth.  Shes the ONLY women I would not have a problem hitting like a fucking man.  I hope that bitch spontainiously combusts.  That would rule.  But next time me and Sean see her, we're putting Syrup in her hair =)

I hung out with Kit again Sunday night....we didnt have anywhere to go so we just drove around and took some pictures.  Shes so cute.  I really like her.  But Im not gonna get my hopes up and fall head-over-heels for her just yet.  Cuz I know she has like...a magillion dudes trying to get with her...and Im really not competition at all compared to most of them.  (Christ Jon, get some fucking self esteem!)  Yeah, its true.  I dunno if shes just -really- flirty, or if she actually has a thing for me.  She fuckin BLEW UP my inbox with text messages saying ""I miss you"" and stuff like that...so I guess that kinda says something.  And she told me online ""not to sound mean, but I didnt think I'd like you like this when we were gonna hang out""....hahaha....I honestly didnt expect it either...but we get along really well.  So I'd like to see what happens with us.  <3


So my temporary registration for my car expired today...and I still dont have my permanent one.  It was sent in the mail, but I havent got it yet.  The Marine Corps mail system is the fucking WORST.  And if they lost my fucking registration, ima kill a bitch.  It better come this week...cuz I might want to go home this weekend.

I probably wont be home Christmas Day, because I got fucked and was put on barracks duty for the 26th...and that starts at like, 7am, so theres no fucking way im gonna drive on christmas all the way back to base.  Fuckers.

Anyway, yeah...thats about it.  Fuck off now =)"

So whats been up since Iraq?  Chillin...relaxing when I can....training, of course, because thats all we do here in the Marines.  Just living life in general, and thinking about what Im going to do when I get out in July.  Im just glad to be alive right now.

Most of you know I sold the Celica and got a VW.  I couldnt be happier with it...its awesome.  Come Christmas, Im getting a race chip put in that bitch.  Its gonna be a little rocket!

I dont think I'm really her type anyway.  A lot of the time I feel Im not anyones type. (Oh god, so emo)

I've just realized...I've been single for <b>3 fucking years</b> now.  Thats <i>pathetic!</i>
I dont know whats up....I mean, yeah, I know Im not the most attractive person on the planet...but god damn...3 years?  Thats a long time for anyone.

I really -really- dig Joanna.  I mean, shes fucking amazing.  Not only because shes gorgeous....but because she has the most awesome personality.  Its crazy.

But I always wind up wanting things I cant have.  Its my nature.  I always build myself up and let myself down.  I know its pretty stupid of me, but sometimes I cant help it.  I daydream too much...hahaha

In the meantime, Im just laying back and taking whats coming to me.  Most of the time its just money problems...one thing or another.  It sucks, but its worth having a car Im in love with.  

Anyway...to make a long story short....Im broke, and I need a hot girlfriend.  The end."

Well tonight was interesting.  I was at the gym, just about to start my work out, and we hear *boom*, *crack crack crack crack*...so we look outside, and sure enough, theres an assload of tracers flying right over our base.  

I didnt care...a few rounds here and there are a normal thing around here.  So I just went back to doing my business and tried to ignore it/wait for it to blow over.  But of course some pussy ass Captian (obviously not infantry) came running in saying we had to leave because the rounds were ""coming right over our head.""  No shit jackass, you're about 5 minutes late.

So me and my buddy leave the gym and head up to our post to see if they needed any help, and I hear the radio going nuts.  So I ask ""are they doing a react?""  (A ""react"" is when we all have to run out to our gun trucks because something happened).  And of course...because my life is just peachy like that...we -were- doing a react.  So me and my buddy haul ass over to our trucks.

We had to escort the Ambulance to an outpost just outside base.

Turns out a friend of mine caught some shrapnel from an RPG, and another Marine had a concussion.
They're both going to be fine.

It just pisses me off so bad...these fucking insurgents are always starting shit.  Im about to go all Rambo on their ass and take the whole city out with my fucking bayonet.  

I would really enjoy being home now, and getting on with my life.  kthnx.

My temper is getting shorter and shorter out here.  Everyone is getting sick of each other.  Its like straight off ""The Real World"" or some shit.  Im doing pretty well with not flipping out on anyone yet...but each day Im a little more frustrated, and more easily irritated.  If this deployment doesnt end quick, Im gonna lose my fucking head.  I just want to ram my fist through someones fucking skull sometimes.

*breathe jon*...

So I've been trying to write out here a lot.  Its really tough...this place is just sucking away all my creativity.  I still hold that dream of someday getting a band of my own...and Im not giving up till I try.  I was thinking of some names...and I came up with one I really liked.  ""The Romeo and Juliet Tragedy""...or the ""R&J Tragedy""...something along the lines of that.  It pretty much reflects my lyrics when I write, and it sounds snappy.  hahaha, Sam was like ""it sounds like one of those hardcore emo bands you'd listen to""...hahaha...I love her.  But thats a good name, because at least the name would fit the style...except less emo.  Maybe like ""It Dies Today"" or something.  They're bitchin'.

I've also been listening to a lot of off-style music than what Im used to.  Normal for deployments I guess...I've just been listening to the same shit over and over, and I needed a change.  I got some H.I.M., Sublime, Coldplay, Dashboard (yeah I know, what the fuck)....My heart still lies with hardcore, of course...but I just needed some ""chill music"".  Things are violent enough here as it is.  hahaha

So yeah, thats like, my update for the next century.  I miss you all.  And I'll see you soon."

I dont know why I've lost so much interest in this thing.  I guess Im just becoming lazy.  Who knows.

Well not much has been going on...I went on another small mission...it was fucking retarded.  But everyone came home alive, and they found TONS of hidden weapons, so I guess it wasnt all bad.  

When they were pulling out one of our platoons by a helicopter, some Iraqis started shooting at the Helos when they were flying away.  Well, the Cobra Attack Chopper pilot really didnt like that, so he just lit the place up with missles.  Pretty funny shit.

Anyway, its pretty much down to the home stretch now.  The other unit thats relieving us had their Battalion commander come over to our base and check it out.  That just makes it even more real.  Im so fucking excited....its like Christmas when your 7, but like, times 302894.

I put up a ""For Sale"" sign for my car on Myspace, so hopefully it catches someones eye.  I really want something different.  Im just not sure exactly what just yet.

I have a really shitty shoulder.  And I dont know whats wrong with it.  I was trying to do some incline bench press in the gym the other night, and the bitch just gave out on me.  Not cool.  I dont want to be like, disabled and shit when Im 23.

Heather Damron got accepted to Towson University, so Im gonna party with her when I get home.  Its been awhile, but Im glad we still talk.  


I've been trying to write a lot more while I've been out here...just jotting down lyrics and shit...I have the worst writers block, though.  Especially when I try to write in this fucking journal.  Its retarded.

"event","I slept outside the other night.

It was really quiet...the sky was totally clear, and there was a nice cool breeze.  For a minute, I actually forgot I was in a combat zone.  It just reminded me how much life I still have to live.  And how I never want to see combat again after Im done with this.  Peace is just something you dont appreciate until you've lived through so much violence.

I was just talking to my friend Jess...and I was explaining how no one could ever experience this feeling out here.  No one will ever know....not even remotely...what its like to be living in the middle of a war.  What you feel, how you act, what you think.  

I just walk outside...and I'll have daydreams in my head of something like an RPG...just flying in and exploding right next to me....and they're so vivid, I can hear exactly what it would sound like.  

Its gotten to the point out here, where I can tell the difference between different explosions and what caused them.

Its just such a fucked up place.  And I cant wait to get home.



Soooooo....Im trying to be as productive as I can out here.  I've been going to the gym like a fucking freak.  I just started adding some cardio to my work out routine, so hopefully by the time I get back, I'll be able to see my abs I used to have.  hahaha

I really want to get back into paintball whenever I get home.  I've invested so much money into that sport, and I've had so much fun, and made so many friends....I cant just abandon it.  I might try to go back to my field and work as a ref again when I get out.  That was just a fun job to have.  Except when I get shot in the dick.  Holy fuckola, that was painful.  I just have to get Shawn to spin me back up on things since I've been out of the game for so long.  

Im also looking to maybe get a small pick-up truck, like an S-10 Xtreme or a Dodge Dakota R/T when I get back.  Hopefully they'll have one in my price range when I get back.  I really dont like my car that much...and I guess Im willing to shell out a few extra bucks to get something I'll really be happy with.  But the only problem is, Im trying to save as much money as I can for when I get out.  Im -so- fucking bad with that.  I always want to buy this and that...tsk tsk tsk, Jon.  FOR SHAME.

I really miss my friends.  I know when I get home Im gonna be bouncing ALL over the fucking place seeing people when I get back.  I think half this combat pay will go towards filling my car with gas, seeing as its like 02385034958 a fucking gallon now.

"event","Sorry for the lack of updates, people.  I know you're just *dying* to read my journal.

Well I left off after I got back from that week long mission.  It was in support of Operation Matador...if any of you heard anything about it on the news.  It was pretty big.  We had a lot of close calls...like....REALLY fucking close calls that I dont ever want to expirience again.  But Im thankful to still be here, alive and kicking.  I'll tell everyone about it when I get home.  Im halfway there.

So I had this weird dream last night that involved Amber.  We were still together, and we were incredibly happy and shit.  Just smiling and kissing and shit.....and I had an amazing sense of calmness in my dream, like everything was in place.  Its really fucking weird that I dreamt that....because I havent heard from her or even thought about her in a long time.  I was discussing with Sam, how the human mind is really amazing.  How it retains so much stuff...more than you'd think.  Just knowing that you use only about 10 percent of your brain, makes you wonder what you could do if you stimulated the other 90 percent, you know?  Its just weird how it releases locked away memories, when you didnt ask it to.  I woke up, kind of missing her, but it went away after awhile.  It was just really ackward.


And when I think about it...honestly...Im not even sure that I want a girlfriend.  For the first time in my life, I dont feel like I -need- to be with someone.  I was so dependant on relationships to make me happy...I mean, dont get me wrong, the feeling was euphoric when I was with someone I was in love with, but I've learned to value my friends so much more now.  Im not saying Im completely done with even trying to have a relationship, because Im a Pisces, and thats pretty un-realistic.  I just look back on these few years....from when I was 18 until now, and realized how much I've grown and changed.  I've found out a lot about who I really am.  And what makes me who I am.  And its funny because I thought I had it all figured out back then...and I know I dont have it all figured out just yet, but I know a lot more.  Reading back-dated journal entries...and seeing how I used to act and carry myself....it was just sad.

I've just learned how to relax a lot more.  Stop being so overly cautious.  Stop thinking so pessimisticly.  Stop acting so jealous.  And most of all, have more self confidence.  Thats my biggest problem, and its just hard for me to do.  I've never been a prize, you know?  I've always felt like the guy that didnt have a chance with anyone.  But Im striving to better myself as much as I can now.  Im working out a lot, Im relaxing...trying to to stress out about stupid shit all the time, and trying not to think that people look down on me all the time.  That leads to making dumb fucking accusations, which in turn, just bites you in the ass.  Kinda like that Mandi thing...I thought she was playing me...I just had this overwhelming feeling, because I was so insecure.  And that just blew up in my face.  But at least I can admit that it was no one but me who fucked that up.  I just dove too quickly into the ""emotion pool""...thinking too far ahead.  Thats always been a problem I had...but not anymore...I've learned from my mistakes.

I think that was the reality check that got me thinking pretty hard about the way I acted towards relationships.  You try too hard for something, and it just looks pathetic.  They say you'll find someone when you're not even looking.  I guess I can only hope thats true.  Because as of now, Im just enjoying life.  

Out here...you really get a good grasp of reality, and life itself.  How precious it is...and how it can just be taken away in a fucking heartbeat.  You only get one life.  Its pointless to live it if all you do is worry about petty bullshit and have a negative attitude.  In a way, war has opened up my mind in a way I never saw things before.  

I've pretty much decided on my next tattoo.  Its going to be a big piece on my back....a memorial tattoo to everyone who has lost their lives in this war.  Even though right now, I dont know anyone personally that has died, but reguardless of that fact, they're still people fighting the same fight I am.  And they're my brothers in arms.  And right now, I feel very fortunate to be alive, and I feel its only right to do that in their memory.  After seeing what I saw out there 2 weeks ago...I really cant think of anything else I'd rather do than honor the fallen.

Well thats all I got for now.  Until next time
PEACE OUT GANGSTAZ."

There was a lot of shooting yesterday.  They shot down one of our helicopters.  And there was a firefight that lasted about 7 hours.  So much for the peace I was enjoying...hahaha

Im trying to get on here as much as I can to keep in touch with friends, since I have that luxury and all.  I still enjoy letters, though....because I can keep them forever.  I still have every letter I've got since boot camp.  Im sure they'll be cool to read later down the road when Im like 30.

Its 2:10am here.  Im awake because they're expecting some more violence.  I really hate losing sleep.

One of our Sergeants brang by some whiskey to pass around.  It was a good time...I really needed that.  It cut the edge off for a few hours...it felt good to just let loose for awhile and relax in the middle of this war.

"event","So as I might have already told some of you, some serious shit went down yesterday out here.  About 5 minutes after I woke up, these insurgents launched this big attack on our base.  Heres the story from fox news:

<i>Monday, the terror group al Qaeda in Iraq claimed to have carried out its second major attack against a U.S. base in a little over a week, saying it was responsible for suicide bombers who tried to ram two cars and a fire truck into a small Marine outpost in the town of Qaim, along Iraq's border with Syria.

The attack on a security checkpoint at Camp Gannon injured three Marines and three civilians, the U.S. military and hospital officials said.

""The drivers of the vehicles were stopped short of the camp by forces manning the checkpoints,"" the military said in a statement.

Military authorities said the explosions slightly damaged the camp's concrete barriers and barbed wire, as well as a nearby mosque.

Insurgents also opened fire on the camp, and a U.S. attack helicopter destroyed a car with a gunman inside, officials said. It was unclear how many insurgents and suicide bombers were killed in the assault. Three Marines were evacuated for medical treatment. </i>




Let me tell you, that was NOT fun to wake up to.  Those suicide car bombers rocked the shit out of our base....so bad that a base about 45 minutes away felt the shockwave and thought THEY were being attacked.  We had to run out to our trucks with bullets snapping over our heads and shit...it was fucking crazy.  Those 3 guys that got medivacs were friends of mine....Im pretty sure they're doing alright though...just treated for concussions from the blast and possibly internal bleeding.  



We went out later on and took a look at what the carbombs did.....they fucking LEVELED this area...I have a few pictures of it (including the foot of one of the bombers still intact).  


All in all, it was a long fuckin day."

yeah, I finally decided to get off my ass and update this thing.  

Same old shit here, really.  With the exception of a few certain events that involved lots of gunfire and stuff.  But hey, if I lived in Compton, I'd feel right at home.

My buddy was telling me he was thinking about extending his deployment out here if they'd let him be a bodyguard for the Colonel.  An extra 7 months.  Thats about another $14-15000.  Thats a LOT of fucking money.

It doesnt sound like such a bad idea...but I know when it comes time for me to leave, I'm probably gonna want to leave...hahaha.  

I've been trying to work out as much as I can lately.  Our schedule is so inconsistant, so its hard to keep a solid routine.  I really hate skipping work outs and shit...it bothers me.  

I watched that movie ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" with Jim Carrey....that was an EXCELLENT movie.  I suggest you see it if you havent already.  Because I fucking said so.

Im not totally sure about getting this Camaro quite yet...I knew I'd probably change my mind a thousand times about it...I always do that.  Im very in-decisive when it comes to cars and junk.  Now Im thinking about getting a truck or an SUV.  Who the fuck knows....I might even just keep the car I have and put some shit into it.  I guess I'll have to wait and see in SEPTEMBER!  hahaha

Man...thats too far away.  *sigh*
Hope everyone is doing dandy!


Oh yeah, and I guess I'll post this short little poem I wrote, just for the fuck of it.

Until tonight burns away into morning grace.

Things have been relatively calm here...with the exception of someone getting killed from our unit not too long ago, and a few others injured in the incident.  Fucking suicide car bomber.  Its really tradgic.  He was the first person thats been killed here from our unit.  I hope his family is alright...

When people ask me how I am, its basically the old saying ""same shit, different day.""  Its so routine...its making me go crazy.  I hope my mom sends my DVD player and DVDs soon...I need some entertainment.  Im gonna start trying to get a gym routine going to keep me occupied like I did in Africa...hopefully it'll get my mind off shit.

I've got a few letters from some people...a few birthday cards and stuff that made me crack the fuck up.  Im really thankful for having awesome friends like that.

I still havent got the fuckin package my mom sent me...hopefully it'll come soon...I want my stuff!  hahaha

I think I wanna sell my car when I get back and buy a Z28.  Sean told me it was a stupid idea, and just to pay off my car and save the money to get put a down payment on a house when I get out of the Marines.  Thats not a bad idea either, but I really dont like my car.  I've always wanted a Z28.  But to afford it, I'll have to get liability insurance for it.  Sean also thinks thats a dumb idea too...hahaha...but I can see why he says that.  We'll see what happens, though.  I have plenty of time to think about it.  So I dont know exactly what Im gonna do.

I gotta find a decent job when I get out that can hold me over for awhile.  I also need to look into maybe going to AACC or something when I get out.  I have the GI Bill and shit, so I might as well use it.  But I want to see if they support the Combat Action Ribbon so I can get free tuition.  That would rock.

Everyone around here has been finding these puppies and junk and they're taking care of them.  They're so cute...they just follow you around and stuff.  I have a picture of one of them on myspace.

Well, other than that, nothing has really been going on. Im looking to get promoted (maybe) in a few months, so I'll get a little pay increase.  But Im just looking forward to getting out all together.  Im so sick of the military.  Its almost as bad of a decision as buying a Z28.  Almost.  hahaha

Its down to a little over a week until I leave for Iraq.  

But this past weekend I had a fucking -blast-

It was probably one of the more eventful weekends I've had in awhile.

When I got home on Friday, me and the guys all went out midnight drunken bowling.  Good fuckin times!  We hit up the liquor store before we went bowling so Oz, Rachel, and Shawn could drink.  Me and Flippo just tore up the bar and bought a few pitchers of beer.  Rachel speared Oz.  Shawn speared Rachel.  Took lots and lots of funny ass pictures!  We eventually went back to Flippos and drank until we all passed out in drunken bliss.

The next morning I awoke to Shawn screaming ""nigger"" in my ear, over and over again.  So yeah, I was pretty much awake after that.  We went to Bob Evans and pissed everyone off there.  It was hilarious.  I met up with Bobby after he got off work, and we looked around at Marley Station Mall.  That place sucks.  Later, I planned on meeting up with Mandi and going to a bar with her, but Flippo and Shawn just BITCHED and BITCHED because it was the last night Shawn could do anything since he has the WORST WORKING HOURS EVER.  So I cancelled plans with Mandi, and called Bobby up because he invited me out to Hammerjacks.  So Me, Shawn, Prange, and Flippo pile up in Pranges car and headed off to Baltimore.

After getting terrible directions, and almost getting completely lost, we finally found the place.  Shawn and I had to go back to the car on more than one occasion because they had a dress code.  Luckily I left my knife and brass knuckles in the car, cuz the cops patted everyone down and used a metal detector, LoL.

We got inside, and I heard the most beautiful news.  ""Open Bar""  It was crunk time.

It was such a ""thug joint"", and all they played was rap....but Shawn and I had a blast anyway.  There were so many women....and free drinks.....it was rad.

Well Bobbys friend got thrown out for fighting, so they left, and Flippo wanted to leave (of course), so we left shortly thereafter.

I was so pissed, and I wasnt done partying, so I called up my friend Chris in Towson and left for there at about 2 in the morning.  Showed up there, had a few beers, watched my buddy Miller win the trophy for loudest drunk on earth , watched Christ totally eat the pavement cuz he slipped on some ice outside (funniest thing ever!)...and then went to sleep on a couch.  

Next morning I awoke, still a little woozy, and headed back to Crofton.  At about 100mph.  Good ol' Celica.

I hung out with Tara for a majority of the day. I was planning on doing shit for the Super Bowl, but Sean left, and Shawn had to work...so I just wound up back at Taras place and we watched Boondock Saints.  That movie is rad as hell.

Mondayyyyy......ummmm.....what the fuck did I do on Monday?

Oh I went and bought some clothes, and sat around for awhile, saw my lovely Michelle =D, then hung out with Steve and we rocked the mullet pretty hard...then really nothing after that.  

Tuesday marked the end of my awesome weekend.  I hung out with Ryan Welsh, who I havent seen in forever, and we jammed in his basement for awhile.  It was so much fun.  He played me his hilarious ass songs he made up, and I almost died.  Then he made some rad ass smoothies.  I felt very healthy afterwards.  Then I came back and hung out with Tara for a few more hours.  We watched part of that Pee Wee Herman movie, LoL.  Then I came back, and me Shawn and Flippo went out to Applebees.  

Flippo rocked the mullet the entire time.

the end."

The time I spent here was absolutely amazing.  Thats actually an understatement.

Its almost like a tease...being home for so long...it made me realize how much I've missed it here.  And how much I cant wait until I get out of the effin Marines.

My friends are the absolute fucking best.  I wouldnt trade a thing in the world for them.  I dont know where I'd be without them.

The thought of leaving is making me sick to my stomach.  Its just really depressing.

...needless to say, that meant we went bar-hopping.

It was pretty fun.  A lot of people showed up.  We didnt think that many people would be there.  But it was good times.  

3 bars later, when everyone was good and sloshed, everyone decided on the Strip Club!  YAY!

I love strip clubs.  Not only because there is tits and brews, but because I like to blow off the women and make myself feel cool.  HAHAHAHA

My buddy Dan had a little too much to drink, so he just slept in the truck...hahaha

As most of you know, I was in the field all last week.  It fucking blew nuts.  Thursday night, at around...hmmm....I'd say 2am...a thunderstorm rolled in and rained on all of us sleeping Marines.  Maybe peoples cell phones were destroyed by the flood it brang with it.  Good times had by all!!!!

So friday I kept the trend alive and got blitzed.  And had a tailgate party in front of the barracks on Saturday.  It was a blast!  I passed out in a chair watching pornography....ahhh...thats the life.  hahahaha

I saw Dodgeball for the first time on Saturday, too.  And if you havent seen it, you fucking need to!  Its so fucking great!!

I've been feeling better lately.  I cant wait to come home Saturday...even though I gotta bring like...everything home with me...so that kinda sucks.  But Im not in a shitty mood...well...at least for now.  I had a good weekend, and Im just looking forward to when I come home and see my home-boys.

It seems like all my entries are bitch-fests lately, but theres really nothing good happening in my life right now that I can write about.

My Battallion is the fucking worst.  Our whole chain of command is just bullshit.  I cant even trust some people directly in charge of me because they're two-faced.  People I trained with from the beginning, I cant trust now because they picked up rank and allowed themselves to be brainwashed, and they suck dick to make themselves look better.  So all I got is my rank and below to rely on right now.  And myself.

They've just been treating us like fucking kids lately.  Its bullshit.
They dont plan shit out well at all, either.  Last night we sat around for 4 fucking hours, and we finally got off work a little past midnight.  Then we had to wake up at 4:45 and be ready by 5:15.  Fucking horseshit.

And all these other things that they're doing are pissing me off too.  I really wish there was no rank structure, and people could talk man-to-man.  Because a lot of these pussies hide behind their rank.  And I know most of them would get their fucking ass kicked.  Without the Marine Corps, they'd have no life...which is sad in itself.

Im just getting sick of my fucking routine fucking life.

Im coming home on the 18th for 2 weeks....and thats the last time anyones gonna see me for a long time.  Hopefully not forever.

Like I said before, Mandis got a boyfriend.  I dont know why, but it kinda bothers me.  I really liked her.  But then again, we really werent anything.  Just a few ""friendly kisses"" I guess.  Its just kind of a let down.  I just wanted too much too fast.  I always have that problem.

I just want something to remember before I leave.

I really wanted to do something this weekend, too.  Theres not many more days until I leave back to Iraq, so I wanna make the best of it.  

I was at the rifle range all week, in case you people were wondering.  I scored Rifle Expert again.  That means I have a 3rd award now.  HOLLA.  Im a fuckin beast.

There really isnt much other news.
Im going back to the field next week again...so that sucks...hopefully I'll come home that weekend though.

Mandi has a boyfriend now.  *shrugs*  I havent seen her in 2 months anyway...LoL

My Sergeant fucked up my god damn computer while I was at the range cuz I let him use it.  So it wouldnt connect to the internet and shit..and it took me hours to fucking fix it with my brothers help.  I was pretty irritated.  Technology is annoying.

Okay, so I drove 10 fucking hours on Wednesday because of the fucking traffic, and I had to drop some people off.  Talk about some fucking stiff legs.  ugh.

I called Mandi while I was driving but she didnt answer.  Then later on down the road, the lovely Kiley and Ally gave me a ring.  I messaged them on myspace and gave them my celly and told them to give me a call, but I didnt think they really were.  They told me to come out to the Thunderdome that night cuz their friends band was playing, so that pretty much made my plans for the night.  They told me they'd call me back around that time.

Well later Mandi called me back and I told her I was going to a show, and she was like ""So much for hanging out, asswipe!""

......?

Okay, when I asked her the other day what day we were gonna hang out, she said she didnt know.  THEN on the phone she tried pulling some shit saying that she told me she was going to PA friday and going to DC on Saturday (I thought we would be hanging out on one of those days).  Ummm...No.  You didnt tell me that, because I would have remembered.  

So she got all pissed and was like ""okay well bye.""
pshh.  whatever.  I dont need that bullshit.  so I just shrugged it off.

Well, Kiley and Ally forgot to call me back, so I just headed up to the Thunderdome anyway.  I tried the side door, and it was locked or some shit, so when I went to the other door, the security guy told me to use the door that I just tried getting in.  So I tried again.  Still locked and shit.  So I was like ""...?"" and I just left.  Turns out Kiley and Ally were there the whole night!  LoL I felt so fuckin dumb.  I was like ""SHIT!!""  So I called this girl Jessica cuz she invited me out to Jaspers, but she didnt pick up her phone cuz apparently she was wasted...LoL

I got back to Seans, and I talked to Angela on the 'puter.  We had nothing to do, so I went to her house and hung out for like an hour just bullshitting.  She's really funny...I had a good time.



THANKSGIVING:
Got up at 11.  Showered/Shaved/all that morning bullshit.  Then I headed over to my uncles house.  Saw all the family I havent seen in forever, and I finally got to meet my baby newphew.  He is so beautiful.  I was just playing with him for awhile and stuff.   Did the whole Thanksgiving mess, then went home.

Well my cell phone was in my jacket, which was hanging up on the coat rack, and I had a missed call from Kiley.  She called at like 7:30, and I didnt get the voicemail until 11:30 because I didnt think to even check it!  I was so pissed!!!!!  lol they're probably like ""Fuck this kid!!""  hahaha.  I called back, but I figured it was too late.

I went and met this chick named Angie that lives right near my moms house.  Um...yeah...that was weird..i dont wanna get into it.

Let me tell you.  Im very happy that thanksgiving is over.  Just for the mere fact that EVERY MOTHER FUCKER feels the need to say ""Gobble Gobble"" like they're a god damned Turkey.  SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!!!

Well its Friday, and hopefully SOMETHING interesting happens.  I only have small amount of time before I go back to Iraq, so Im trying to make the best of it."

Yet I write these beautiful words to break your heart
Its not my intent, its my only salvation from you
To let you know how I feel
And wish you'd feel the same out of spite
Because it shouldnt be contrast like this
Like it always has been
For happiness is something I can only long for now
And with these tattered wings I cannot fly again
I just wonder if I'll ever get to touch the lips of grace one last time

Another lonley night
As the sun sets, it plays out a story of a heart
Of how it used to be untouchable
But now it slowly burns away and dies
So fragile I can destroy it with a single breath
So I'll wait alone again
Side by side with emptiness
Is this hole in my chest big enough for you?
You can take back your words that are suffocating my memories


As I write this last confession
Of true love, and of true bitter sorrow
I have forsaken you
And god has forsaken me
But you're still buried in my sanctuary
As I am marked for death, my love
(Slain by my own hand or thine enemy)
And this is the last time you'll embrace me
So breathe this in and never let go.

So...I finally admitted to having a drinking problem.  It was just getting out of control.  I drank every day when I got off work, and drank heavily on the weekends.  So I turned myself in to my SACO (Substance Abuse Control Officer), who actually used to be my section leader, so I had a pretty close relationship with him.

He made me sign a form saying I wouldnt drink until he said Im allowed to.  He's seeing if I can stop drinking so much on my own.  But if I slip up, he's gonna send me to AA and I cant drink for a year.

So yeah...Im trying to make this better.  I dont want to become like some other people in my family, cuz alcohol abuse runs in it.  I have too much other shit going on in my life right now, and being an alcoholic wouldnt help.  But part of the reason I drink so much is because OF all the other shit in my life thats going on...its kind of a vicious cycle.  I drink to forget about it.  To feel ""normal"".   Its really embarassing.

Im coming home next wednesday for Thanksgiving.  I -would- come home this weekend, but I have to go out to the field Friday, Saturday, AND Sunday.  =/

I think Mandi and I are gonna hang out since I havent seen her in like, a month.  

hah...it kinda sucks that I let her slip through my fingers.  But ya know, what can ya do? 

I pretty much ran out of time to find someone to hook up with before I leave.  Ew...and the way I just said that makes it sound like a mission....I guess, if something happens to me, I didnt want to die alone, ya know?

But Im not getting into that.


Oh yeah...if you want to see the saddest music video/song (I suggest watching the video, it makes more of an impact) in the WORLD, listen to ""Whiskey Lullaby"" by Brad Paisley.

I dont listen to country or anything...but that video will almost bring a tear to anyones eye.

Everything about it sucked.

The only thing that is awesome on base is ME.

I fucking rule. Im better than you. And Im better than your grandma. And if your grandma is dead, Im sorry.

No Im not, Im better than your grandma. She deserved to die, she was sucking up my oxygen. Fucking bitch.

Anyway, back to me.

Yes, I may seem like an ""asshole"" to some people. But thats only in the eyes of the jealous.

You wish you could be me.

Yeah, try to talk shit. Go ahead. Say something ""insulting"". It just shows me you try to deny greatness because you're consumed with envy. Everyone that isnt Shawn, Sean, or I, wishes they could be us. Because we're not like anyone else. We're fucking better than everyone.

And if someone is like ""Oh...you're not great! Im great!"" We just kick them in the junk and send them on their merry way.

Stupid people. When will they learn to stop sucking?

Ill tell you when:

NEVER.
Because they'll always suck.

So stick a dick in your ear and fuck what you've heard.

And if you dont like that, you can finger your own assholes until you die, because I dont care.


Lets just show an example.

Everyone loves Jonny Depp.

But lets compare him to me.

""Jonny Depp has millions of dollars.""
Jons Conclusion: Who the fuck cares, Im better than Jonny Depp.

""Jonny Depp is 'soooo hot'.""
Jons Conclusion: Bullshit, Im perfect, Im so much better looking than Jonny Depp, so go fuck yourself with a rusty pole.

""Jonny Depp is such a great actor.""
Jons Conclusion: Bullshit, My ass could act better than he could after I eat a #6 Meal at Taco Bell, mother fucker!

""Jonny Depp is so much better than Jon Maines.""
Jons Conclusion: Bitch, you need to be shot. Jonny Depp strives to be as good as me, therefore, since he's on TV, he looks more appealing...but since Im too great for TV, you wouldnt understand that. I hope you choke on a frisbee.

All in all, everyone wishes they could be as cool as me, and if they deny it, then they are just covering up their want to commit suicide because they are in fact, NOT me.

It was just Steve and I that went.  I asked my friend Mandy if she wanted to go, but her friend that was gonna go decided not to, so she stayed home.  

We didnt have too much trouble finding the place...I only had to turn around once (which is a fucking bitch in downtown Baltimore), but we got duped and payed 5 bucks for parking, when there was a free lot just around the corner.  DAMN YOU, PARKING LOT LADY!!!!

So there was this big ass line waiting to get in the Ottobar...I just kept my fingers crossed that it wouldnt sell out, because I didnt know exactly how many people were inside, and how big the venue was.  Luckily we got in, so it was all good.  Its a really tiny fuckin place...and I thought the 9:30 club was small.  hahaha

Remembering Never played first.  They did really good....their set wasnt that long, though.  But either way, I hadn't seen any of them live, so I was just glad I got to see them.

Black Dahlia Murder was next...they were fucking bad as shit.  At the end of their set, the drummer chucked a drumstick out to the crowd and I got it.  Then I proceeded to hit Steve with it...hahaha

Um...I really wish there wasnt a Bar there.  I spent too much fucking money on shots and shit.....and PS:  Doing shots before going to the pit = not fucking cool.  I wasnt feeling too hot, so I just downed a bunch of water.  So much for my buzz.

Terror played next.  They tore shit up....mother fuckers were going ape-shit in there.  I went in the pit and got punched like 20 fucking times.  hahahaha....there were these 2 little girls that were just tearing shit up in the middle of the pit...it was cute as hell....lol I think one of them hit me though.  I should have HIT HER IN THE FUCKING FACE.

Last but not least, Unearth, one of my favorite bands.  Their performance was just unholy.  The first time I saw them was with Hatebreed back last year at some place in NC.  I liked them, so I picked up their CD, and have been hooked ever since.  They blew up the fucking place last night.  It was nuts.

This is really, though, the first time that I've been to a show that everyone did their little dance/spin-kick shit instead of old-fashioned moshing.  Hahaha, I went in there throwing fists like a mother fucker...it was fun.  Some guy was going nuts and was almost hitting me in the face with his elbows...so I pushed him away from me, and he fucking kicked me!

....

So I kicked him back.
Then he kicked me.
And I kicked him again.

Then his little gay friend gave me the little ""cut it out"" signal.  I should have kicked him in his fucking teeth.  Fucker.

Well, after the show, we got some gas, and went back to Crofton.  Didnt even get lost!  I was so fucking suprised...hahaha

All in all, it was a good fucking night.  I saw a few people from Myspace that were out there...none of whom I talk to, so that kinda sucked.  But I did see a few people I know.

Well, that was just my re-cap of the night. The moral of this story is:  Dont buy liquor at the Ottobar.  Its rape."

"event","So I had to stay on base this weekend, because Im a fucking broke-ass, and couldnt afford money for gas.  =/

So basically, I've just been sitting here, drinking all weekend. 

Actually...all I've done today is rock out in my room, by myself, stereo cranked, sippin on some brews.  Its quite boring, actually.  I wish I was doing something.

Hopefully my leave gets approved for Wednesday.  I'll be highly pissed off if its not.   




Im going through a rough point in my life right now.  It really fucking sucks.  All I have on my mind is how fast Iraq is coming up.  All the shit they tell us is just such a hassle to hear, because it makes us more nervous.  We had a guy from a batallion in our division tell us a story about when he was in Iraq.  His batallion is the one that we had to back-up in the battle of An-Nasyria.  He said the vehicle in front of him got blown up.  And then his Lieutennant told him and his men to go pick up the bodies of his dead Marines.  It was a terrible fucking story.  I dont want that shit shit happen to me.  I couldnt imagine picking up the limbs of a dead friend.

But its almost guaranteed that we're gonna see some action when we go over there.  They're finding 140 IEDs (bombs) a day over there on average.  Thats fucking nuts.  And everyone I talk to that has gone over there recently (McDonald, Flinchum) has seen shit happen or got attacked.  Its such a fucked up world we live in now...its almost hard to believe.

I dont think anything is gonna happen with me and Mandi.  After all that crap that I said, basically implying that she didnt like me (or so I <i>thought</i>, apparently I was totally wrong about that), I think that kinda pissed her off and it just threw everything off the tracks.  Its blatantly obvious now.  I guess Im not her type.  Its a bummer, but I guess I kinda had my hopes a little too high.  Especially for whats coming up for me.  I cant expect to have a relationship, as much as I'd love to have one, with Iraq coming up.  After me and Amber, I dont expect anyone to wait around for me to come back from anything.  

Its just kinda tough being lonely for so long.  I'd really like to <b>be</b> with someone.  I dont want just a fling.  I want something meaningful.  These days, it just seems like thats just out of reach.

My minds all jumbled up right now.  I cant really think too straight.  I just have that old feeling in my chest thats all too familiar.  

So, I sit and wait.
And watch life pass me by."

"event","so ya, i haven't written in here in an extremely long time, about 7 or 8 months i'd say!!  i mean fuck, i had just met Johnny (ehh) when i last wrote in this, long ass time ago, but anyways...  school has started up again, i'm a big ass junior, only it's not as cool as it sounds!!  i hate school, last week was one of the worst weeks of my life, and now i'm sitting here, eating vegetable lasagna for the 3rd time in the past 2 days (well, i'm not complaining about that)  i started writing in here again though, cuz this kid in my physics class was like, ""live journals raaar""  so ya, here i am, ""debating the value of failure in ones life""  i hope everyones doing ok!!
PEACE"

"event","today was the BEST!!  i mean honestly, i deeply enjoyed it, thoroughly!  so today was the pancake breakfast at skool!!  there's pancakes, bagels, coffee, juice, and sausage (for all you meat eaters!)  and best of all, everything is... FREE!!!!  that's right, i said it, FREE!!  nothings better than when the words food and free are used in the same sentence!  
then after skool my Momma took me to do some c-c-c-crazy shopping!  it awesome!  i got 2 pairs of pants, 4 shirts, 1 sweater, 1 dress, and 1 purse!! if Gucci were here right now she would most definately say, ""Holy cheese and rice!""  
i think i should end every entry with a quote, or lyrics to a song from now on!

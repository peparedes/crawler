"event","I love my brother I really do, but right now he is so way off base it isnt funny. He calls me up and says hi, and then starts asking about my college plans and why I am not taking this scholarship for civil engineering or whatever thta will give me a whole lot of money, instead of what I have decided and just going for my architectural/architectural engineering degree. I know most if not all my schooling would be paid for but I dont want to do it. And he gets off and calls me selfish. I am gonna make whatever way and schooling i take work. HOW IN THE HELL CAN HE CALL ME SELFISH!?!?!
He is so full of crap!

He is no angel either. Him and mom are the same because they both were attracted to and married controling personalities. Mom knew that he would be calling her up with some complaints about when she was at his house. He calls up mom a week after she gets back because suzette got mad because she got some wrong things on a shopping list. DUH! How stupid can he get. He made her cry. Said stuff about her and not being able to be around the baby. Suzette should have said something to mom herself. OMG!!! I am not the only ""selfish"" one. . .

I am super pissed off, but I still love them. . .

Edit: Well he called and talked to me again, he does want the best for me, but he still can really make me angry. I really do love you, even tho you aren't always in the right. . ."

"event","God, its so close to graduation. I am so excited and horrible scared! I just got my senior shirt and cap and gown last week. My senior shirt is aweseom, its a baseball jersey that has spazztik on the back. Its really sweet. Cap and gown pics are coming up after spring break. I have to wear a white skirt/dress. AGH! Spring break starts next week, I have a whole lot of half days of school, but its not to bad. I also have a half day tomorrow. Its senior skip day but I am going to tech anyways. 

Well prom is coming up soon. My dress is currently getting made. I will have my first fitting the first week of May. I am excited to see how it will turn out. well I got a date for prom. Its a dude from the boys home. (yeah I know. . ) I don't really like him, but he asked me to take him to prom and I said yes. He dips, which seriously bugs me, but hes pretty nice. He also asked me out kinda, and I said ok for now. Dunno how this is going to work out, but what the hell, I have no life anyway and it seems to be ok, maybe until prom at least.

I am going to be going to as many graduations of my friends as possible. My graduation is that first week in June (not sure exact date) and all of my peeps are invited. 

TTYL People!"

Mom is gone til Saturday and then she is leaving again Tues. both times to go to NC. It really sucks. Especially since I have to cook and clean while she is gone. AGH! And Naomi's play is coming up and if dad doesn't feel up to it the day after his doctor's appointment we aren't going. Which sucks. AGH! And I just found out today that tomorrow the money and forms for the yearbook is due. I didn't even know the forms came in the mail til today! AGH! Maybe I can work something out since I have Journalism.

But on a good note, the seamstress said that she would be able to make the dress for me. YAY! Its gonna cost about 300 but mom said yes and we are calling J.D. tomorrow to help get everything set up."

"event","Now lets see where did I leave off. Ok, now I see. 

Well during lunch some medical students told us about the ins and outs of medical school (short version) Then the guy that was in the gross anatomy lab with us gave us a lecture about ""Universe between the ears"" He talked a lot about morals and ethics that go with the medical field. And he doesn't just want test takers to be in that medical school. He also talked about the brain, duh my bad! and handed out a human brain, half of a brain, a damaged brain (part of it was black and hard), a heart, an enlarged heart, a spinal cord and a lung of a smoker. He is on all these boards that talk to the state legislature and stuff about brain injuries. He even has been on PBS. After that we went to another building (through more cold and rain) first thing we did there was go through an interview process and not knowing any different I volunteered. The medical school gets actors to play out certain situations. And you have to know how to talk to people. My situation was a girl who was all depressed since she found her boyfriend after he committed suicide. Man, that was tough. She was crying and everything. Next we went to an exam room in groups with an instructor (the patient in a robe) and got to learn how to listen to the heartbeat (5 different places), look inside a persons ear, and take a reflex in the arm. The guy was pretty funny. He was talking about how doctors don't like him to much since he tells them what they are doing wrong for a living. After the reflex thing, he asked me if I was a drummer since I hit so hard. It was really cool. Then we went to a small lecture about communication skills. Like what doctors have to ask people and how they do it. Then we ran through the parking lot back to the bus. It was like an hour bus ride to the Air and Space Museum. We went and watched imax about an elephant herd. It was sooooo sooooo soooo boring. I would've rather gone through the museum. Especially since they were doing something about hte circus and they had like a tightrope and skuff and that on bouncy thing that people could try out. It would've been fun. I then went to the girt shop. It so made me feel like a kid again. I loved it. I played with a lot of the toys. I got rock candy, my mom some patches. . .HAHAHA NAOMI! lol! ONES FOR YOU! lol j/k, and I got a monkey beanie baby. I started wearing him on my head. He makes a good hat. He is one of my new best friends. If I don't get a date I am taking him to prom in a lil tux since there is not much difference between him and teenage boys. LOL! We went back to the hotel and about 7 ate dinner, Spaghetti. After that we played (attempted) some group games. It didn't work out to well since the room was so small. And then we gathered up to the projector and watched a real autopsy. That was nasty. We talked the teach into letting us stay in the room til 11 and noone really did. I stayed and talked to some of the people and the teach. I took a shower then and went to bed. My roomate, Brittany (one the other was Katie they are really nice) got locked out. And Katie was asleep and I was in the shower. And I had to go get out of the shower and unlock the door after about 10 min. with soapy hair. It wasn't to pleasant. I felt so bad tho. I got up about 6 30 went and ate. Packed up all my stuff and we left at 8. We did the stopping every 2 hours and stuff. During lunch my teach called my non-conformist. I kinda like that term. I wore my monkey on my head or shoulder the whole way back. It was almost snatched twice and was snatched once during a break. MONKEY SNATCHERS WILL HAVE MONKEYS COME ATTACK THEM WHEN THEY SLEEP!!! LoL! We finally got back to the college at 4 and then mom took me home (another hour or so) It was a long trip but fun.

I finally got my hair back one color. Just sunday to actually. I am very happy about that! School is going ok. I am having senioritis. AGH! The site plan in drafting is getting on my nerves. Journalism nothing is going on, I got to go help decorate a classroom for St. Patricks Day (my painted shamrock looked pretty good). I hope I don't forget to wear green like I do every year. English we are getting a lot of projects. Like when I got back like 2 days later I had to give an oral report on the Squires tale of the canterbury tales. And tomorrow I have to do a presentation on Morgan La Fey and for extra credit Excalibur. In anatomy I have an oral disease report due soon and 4 labs due the 22nd. One is going to take about 8 days to finish so I am gonna have to do it as fast as possible.

Well socially, nothign is really happening. Prom is big thing in my mind. My friend J.D. helped me design a dress. We are trying to get it made. Its pretty but kinda goth. It looks really cool tho. I like it. Well I don't know if it really means anything. He could just be joking. But AJ kinda mentioned going to prom with me. I dunno. I kinda said i'm sure you'll do if there is noone else. I dunno why, I am so stupid. He is probably joking and if he was serious well that was an awful reply. If he went (even tho he has a girlfriend) I would probably be one of the happiest girls in the world. And that would make prom so freaking awesome! I dunno tho. I still like him with no hope. But thats life.

Oh and almost forgot, my sis-in-law and bro are having a baby boy in august! YAYAYAYAYAYAY! His name is gonna be Devin Yates. I like it! TTYL!"

"event","Hey guys! 

My trip went well ok. I tried to dye my hair back to one color red on Saturday, no it didn't work. I need 2 packs of hair dye and well, it was kinda messy for the trip. Well thats not really about the trip but. . . I left on Sunday early and went to Abingdon, ate lunch at Dairy Queen and then went to the college. We left from the college about one. Thank god it was a charter bus. After stops for dinner and every 2 hours you have to stop we finally got to the Sheraton (fancy shmancy) in Norfolk about 9:30. I took a shower before bed and woke up at 6 went to breakfast at 6:30 and then we left at 8:15. We drove to the EVMS (medical school). The teach said to leave our coats in the buses bad mistake since it was cold and rainy.  Well first thing we did was go to a lecture on what the medical school is doing in the way of cancer research (proteins in thehuman serum). Then we saw the equipment. We then went to the library and learned about looking up good medical advice on the internet. And then an art therapist came and talked. We then went to the gross anatomy lab where there were lots of cadavers laid out. There we got to put on gloves and stick our hands into the open cadavers. It smelled gross and looked it. I got a lil queasy. Some of them were missing heads or only had part of a head or had them. I got to hold a human heart and lung and got ot touch inside the body like liver and fat and intestines. It was gross. Then we ate lunch. 

I will finish the rest later. . ."

"event","Hey guys whats up? I am just sitting here just procrastinating and holding off on stuff i need to do. How is everyone doing? I just wanna see some updates from my friends. Expecially those who I haven't talked to in a while. So if everyone if they see this just say hey, it would be nice. Anyways, pardon me if I sound stupid. 

I can't believe it. Less than 12 weeks til graduation! Everything is just going so fast. Good news guys I did drafting competitions and got third, it was outta 4, but at least i placed, lol. I love my drafting class too! Besides for the long projects we sometimes get stuck with (like now) Also the asshole Ian is getting on my nerves. Won't leave me alone about those few lil mistakes I accidentaly made. GRRR!!! He started calling me chasity today. Ok, that just freaks me out. I don't like that. . .I almost like my ""nickname"" fetish queen, or mini dominatrix or all tho other nicknames better than that. I also have been blinded when i mistakingly looked at him moooning the class TWICE! He is an ass in more ways than one. I will have nightmares about it, FOREVER! Things are a little more relaxed tho between me and AJ. I still like him and he knows it. But he doesn't mention his girlfriend that much. YAY! Makes my days a whole lot better. He is really crazy too. Just goes off singing or saying really random stupid stuff. Its annoying but also cute in a way. 

The only bad thing is I keep thinking about prom coming up and no date. .depresses me a lil bit. He also keeps making these remarks that i should go to prom with Ben Ray, junior from Coeburn, just a lil to frequently. But I am kinda thinking about it since, no date, or asking if Perry Jon (another dude from Coeburn) would go with me. And I won't go with Matt (nice guy but kinda annoying and has no personality) from my school. If I was more of a social person i probably would've had a date by now, but i just ain't that way. I still need to get my dress and shoes and stuff, i can't wait. I really am excited about it! We are also having a dance after spring break so I am really excited about that. I love to dance, even if I look really really really stupid. Which I do, always. But its a lot of fun!  

Getting back to school so far its been good. I got my first pages done for the yearbook (basketball spirit week) It looks pretty good, but I had a hard time getting ideas, thankfully I got some help. And I am very thankful that Nikki is in there because if not I would absolutely die, cause I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone. English is good, we've done a lot of projects and watched movies since my teacher is losing some of the gel in her eyeball and can't really do much reading at the moment. It is nice I enjoyed making a comic on beowulf and making a coat of arms. I personally think my coat of arms looked the best out of everyones anyway. LoL Anatomy is pretty boring, but I am making it getting up so early. I have a field trip from Sun.-Tues. of next week. I am going to sit in and watch/help on an autopsy. Sounds real fun huh? I see dead people. . . *eerie noises* I just hope I don't get sick and throw up. I am not really good with blood and stuff. 

We are getting like baseball jerseys for out senior shirts, weird huh? WE are also selling wrestling tickets to pay for an after prom party. Oh the joys of being a senior. LoL I can't wait til the senior picnic. I am doing that for the yearbook, and a prom page too. 

But anyways, I dunno if I should keep rambling or not. I like it, its fun! But since I want you all to read this I will stop for now. I miss ya'll, even the ones I see everyday. TTYL

She says I should just endure it for the little while I have left and it will get better later. We talked about maybe her helping me find a prom dress. She gave me a really cool idea too. I don't wanna look like everyone else and be more funky than formal. So I might get a nice long skirt and then get a shirt kinda like a tsirt that has a really neat pattern on it and put like rhinestones on it and wear that to the prom. I think that would be fun!"

I hate being emotional. Its just not me. I don't like to cry, especially over a guy. I don't think that getting hung up over a guy is something worth doing. I have seen all of my friends go through it and now, I am guilty of it myself. Well. . AJ gots a girlfriend now, him of all people. I found out about it on Friday, and well that day was really really really bad. He could tell I was mad (more sad really) he asks me about it, I told him I thought he was just dense. I got home, cried, cried, and cried some more (cried on the phone to Naomi too). I think that a weekend should be enough to be normal around him. Wrong. I have to hear about ""her"" so much and today it just got to much for me. I like him, a lot, he is cute, funny, nice, immature, and stupid, and weird, but it doesn't matter to me. Why I like him is beyond me. I am only around him half a school day 5 days a week, it isn't much. Why I am so caught up is a mystery. I like him and I like being friends with him to. Being around him just makes me feel really happy. I don't go for the jocks/preps/really popular guys...I don't have much with guys anyhow. Never had a real boyfriend, I think most guys aren't worth the time and effort, I try my best to push them away. They don't really like me anyway, and I am freaked out when they actually do. They aren't worth the heart ache. And the one I don't want to push away I think I will end up doing that. I feel like I have been slapped in the face (x 100) every time he mentions his girlfriend. I am going to end up saying something to him I regret. God. . .its so freaking hard! I need to get him the hell outta my head, but I can't.I fell for him, fell for him hard, I think I fell in love with him. I just want to know if I ever stood a chance. But, I need to let it go, well I at least need to try it, it just ain't really working.

I should call you and try to talk to you more. I AM SO SORRY! I love you so much sis! And if you don't delete that one post I am gonna KICK YOUR BUTT!!! And I am so serious about this. If you don't I WONT CALL YOU! But I still love you!

Thats enough about her. I am doing PACE this year and well it keeps me kind of busy. I do something with PACE everyday except Friday. Mondays are matches, this week is open so I am gonna have practice instead. And Tues-Thurs we have practice til 5. I am pretty busy to. I like the people who are in PACE with me. They are quite the characters, but they are muy interesante y muy fantastico! Audrey, Burrito, Rachel, Hedge, Grant, and Laura and the rest. I have never seen PACE where so little people show up to practice. Most of the time only 3 people show up for practice. Most do other things as well as PACE, cheerleading, or band. We haven't been able to practice with the buzzers, which is much more fun than just sitting and reading. I have a lab report due Fri. night midnight for my anatomy class over the internet. And I am still hoping that tomorrow I will get my grade from the first lab report. I have to do at least one of the labs today. It sucks! Drafting is fun. We are doing like converting angles and stuff which is really boring but its easy and I can handle it. Government is ok, pretty interesting. I am doing really well in it. I think its really easy, most of the work in it is busy work. Spanish is muy bueno! Um. . .scratch that. Its ok, the teacher seems ok, the work kinda sucks, but I can tell the teacher tries to make it fun. I am not good at Spanish. I forget most of it. I failed the first test I ever had in it. My mid-6 weeks report I got an 87, Never in my life before this. I hope I will be able to make it up. Because guess what. . . . .

I AM TIED FOR 3RD IN SENIOR RANKINGS OUT OF 42! w00t! w00t!

Ok thats enough for now. . . But I can't get any bad grades I need all the grades I get to keep my senior ranking. 

Over the past month my music tastes have changed. I have found out I LOVE HEAVY METAL! Not just any heavy metal either, Finnish heavy metal! I like american to but Filand has some kick-butt awesome heavy metal bands. Whoda thunk it? HIM (I think is from Finland) Nightwish, Charon, Lullacry! Oh and I LOVE techno-ish music! Groove Coverage is awesome!

I want DDR! I have been thinking about it for a while. And when I get a job thats what I want to save up for. My mom got an application to help out at an engineering firm, I think that would be so awesome to do something like that or work in a book store. 

April's and Ashley's birthdays are coming up. I got a burnt copy of Seethers new cd for April, I am thinking about copying FF7: Advent Children off for her (I am currently downloading it or attempting to). I need to get Ashley something I just don't know what yet. I hope maybe next weekend I can go down and see everyone! 

I have found out that I am only going to have one parent present this whole week. My mom is leaving tomorrow to go to a thing for work, then to take Ms. Eve back home (old family friend who is staying with us for this week) and to go to the doctors. She won't be back home til Friday. And Saturday my dad is going to go down to babysit Naomi for a few days. I am gonna have to walk home since I don't think I am going to have a ride home from PACE practice.

I think thats enough update for now. Talk to Ya'lls Later!"

I also started my first day of school today. I left for Tech just after 7:50, left on the bus at 8:40. Got to school, saw Mr. Miller and AJ. New people joined our class. There is actually another girl this year and a new guy from JIB. I also found out there is a guy from Brazil that speaks no English coming to my drafting class. I am excited. I also found out that I have a zero block since I have to take World Geography since I didn't have it in 8th grade. My zero block is hopefully Engineering and Robotics, hopefully it will be counted as a science. Or I will probably take anatomy or somethign like that for my zero block. I will have to get up earlier and stuff to take it. I will have to be driven to school too since I will only have 10 min. to walk to school. I have orientation tomorrow in Abingdon at Highlands so I will be skipping Tech. TTYL!"

Naomi's last day here was today! I went to the movies with her and Garith and then went to Walmart. I wish I had been able to spend more time with her these past few weeks. 

I love her so much! I miss her already! We've been together ever since we were babies. I haven't spent more than 3 weeks away from her at a time. Its gonna be hard learning to live without my other half. She has always been the outspoken one, sometimes annoying, but her heart is always in the right place. She has for a long time been the person who did things for me and spoke for me a lot. She was my courage for a long time. I am a person who by nature is antisocial, shy, and a loner, but Naomi has helped push me outside my shell. She has always been there, whether I liked it or not. We may fuss and fight a lot but we still love each other so much! Its gonna be hard learning to cope with the world and be around people normally without her around. God-willing I will make it. I know its not for forever, but its almost like forever to me. Its my senior year and I really wanted her to be with me this year. For prom, graduation,(If she misses either one of those she is DEAD MEAT!!!!!!!) and hopefully first boy-friend *crosses fingers* I want her fashion advice, unneccesary info, clinginess, hugs, and all the other things I love about her, plus all the stuff I don't. I have to learn to make it on my own now and try to grow up. Hopefully that will all work out! I will be depressed for the next week or so and then I am gonna have to start getting over it. I pray that happens. THINGS WILL WORK OUT!

I love you Naomi! Have a wonderful time in NC! Learn lots, become smart and healthy and a good child (for once) LoL! See you really soon! You are my bestest little sister in the world! And my closest sister! And I love that!"

We went and picked Naomi up on Friday. (As most of you know) I gots some awesome b-day presents from NYC! My sister(s) bought me an ipod shuffle. I am trying to figure out how to use it. I think I have got the basics down yet. Its weird you charge it up on your computer. I also got a really cool like magnet board. Its called a translation board. It has japanese written all over it and some doodles and sketches. Its so cool! I can't wait to hang it up on my wall and start using it. My mom also gots me more blank cds (150 for 22 dollars! SAY YAY FOR COUPONS!!!) She also got me cds that teach Japanese. I can't wait to start using them!

Yesterday me, naomi, and my mom went to our storage unit to try and find my summer clothes. (FINALLY!) We went thru the whole storage unit. Guess what. . .no summer clothes!) We were in a panic, finally I found the box of summer clothes in the back of my closet. I should've looked in there first. So yesterday and all (I mean ALL) of today I have been working my butt off going thru the clothes, folding them, putting them away, and figuring out what I am going to take with me to camp. I still have a TON of work to do. But thankfully I can actually see my floor. w00t! w00t! LoL! (oh and I am so happy some of the clothes I can still fit into!) Weird thing is, I found things from when I was 10 that still fit me. I think thats just freaky. Thankfully next year I can get new summer clothes, since I will be going to BARCELONA! (Can't wait to meet hott spanish guys!) XD

I have to get up early tomorrow I have to leave the house by 7 AM!! AGH!! Oh well. . .talk to yous when I get back from camp! Syonara!"

Well anyways enough of the craziness I need to get back to reality. I locked myself out of my room today. My dad had to take the doorknob apart so I could get back in. I also had to open up my curtains and let the light in, which hasn't been done in weeks. XD

Well since I haven't updated since forever I will tell ya'll whats been going on since then.

I dyed my hair bright red and cut it short. My dad freaked when he saw my hair color. XD Also My Birthday was on Wednesday. I AM 17!!! LETS PARTY LIKE ITS 1999!!! LoL I went to Bear Pen pool last Sunday for a party for Sandy. (Her birthdays 3 days before mine) (I gots a really cute bathing suit I gots to wear there, since I heard Zach Lee was gonna be there) LoL XD I then spent the night at her house along with Vanessa, April, and Annabelle. It was a lot of fun. I talked my parents into letting me stay for the 4th and I gots to see the fireworks with Sandy, and Junior, and Ashley Mouse! YAY! The fireworks were beautiful! But let me tell you there must have been something in those caramels I ate, or I was just really ""high on life"" because on the way back from the fireworks I started to act really crazy. Everyone was riding on the back of the truck and we were waiting in the middle lane to go back to Sandy's moms house when the crazy swith in my head turned on. I started yelling and waving at everyone that passed by. I knocked my glasses off the truck and onto the road and Junior had to go get them for me. But what bugs me is one thing I didn't realize I yelled at Frog. I won't ever repeat it. But lets just say there was something wrong with me that night. Ashley mouse spent the night along with Vanessa that night. The nexst day I brought back April and Sandy home with me. They cooked spaghetti for my family. (I tried to help!, Seriously, I did!) I first batch of noodles turned out like paste tho. XD April also fixed my computer (I plugged the wireless adaptor into the wrong USB port! STUPID ME! I was without internet for about a week! AGH!) We took Sandy and April back to Sandys house the next day. Nothing else interesting happened til Saturday. My dad took me to Burger King and then I took him out to see War of the Worlds! IT IS FREAKING AWESOME! AND I MEAN FREAKING AWESOME!!! I recommend it to EVERYONE! Naomi and Joy (My older sis) saw it on Sat. night and said it was to freaky for them. They don't know nothing. Oh. . . I also gots a cd/dvd burner/ dvd player for my birthday from my mom since she has been gone since my birthday. I need more blank cds. . . I used up the 30 or so that were left already. I have cleared up about all my hard drive now. I actually saw 61% not used. . . and then I started downloading stuff again. My mom should be back tomorrow. I miss her. . . Naomi has come back from DC, spent a week at home, and then left for NYC. She will be ""gracing"" everyone here with her presence Fri. or Sat. I am not sure which. She and my sister got me something for my birthday, I don't know what tho. They said it was a pair of underwear from a homeless guy and a patch. I hope not! But then they said it was something I would like. But they didn't get a chance to go to the music store or ipod store. (Which is stuff I like!) :-P Oh and camp starts next Monday. I have to leave the church at 7:30 in the morning. I am so bringing my pillow in the car. I don't wanna wake up early! WAH!

Well I thing thats enough useless info about me for today. I will talk to all the peoples that live inside my computer later!

GUESS WHAT NAOMI KISS MY BUTT I FINALLY FIGURED HOW TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD! And you wont ever, EVER get it! And I just have figured out how to delete my entries! XD And don't even thing about going to hack into my email account, I changed the password there too! I finally get smart about all this crap, Naomi will never do this to me again! Now I just have to figure out how to edit the backgrounds and make it look ok. . .

Now I am gonna rant and rave and tell everyone useless info that is bugging me. . .

1. SOLS ARE THIS MONTH! Geez, getting ready for them is a pain in the butt! The Chemistry one is on the 17th and the English one is on the 22 or 23, I am not sure. The countdown is getting close! AGH! SAVE ME, SOMEONE PLEASE! I DONT WANNA DIE! AGHH!!!

2. Well Naomi is actually leaving. . . I can't believe it, all my other siblings were gone at 16 and Naomi is gonna follow the tradition, A YEAR EARLY! She is going to live with my brother Jacob and his wife Suzette, and maybe if they get their foster kids them too (In NC). She will start school there next semester. There have been a lot of eruptions at my house, especially since her room is right next to my Dad's, noone can handle it, and Naomi has been for the past few months. I mean dealing with my dad is tough, since he got so sick with his cancer he had to go on disability it has been a trying experience for all of us. Not saying anything against him, well kinda but I still luv him and all, but its hard to deal with someone who is a control and clean freak and is stubborn. Sadly I take after him in those bad areas, except for the clean freak part. XD Everything is almost always on edge and the tension is getting to everyone in my house. I guess this is what Naomi needs, at least for now. I hope that things go well with her. But to tell you the truth I am gonna miss her like h*ll! I actually have been really depressed knowing that she is really gonna leave. I actually talked to her and my mom about it this morning. I actually started crying, and Naomi started making fun of me (THAT LITTLE BRAT!!!) Let me say that there is a thin line between love and hate, sometimes with Naomi its on one side or the other, or both at once!But I have not been separated much from her, EVER! Not saying that isn't a bad thing at some point, but up until 9th grade we were together practically 24/7. She is probably the closest person to me. (Maybe her being gone will let me shine a little bit, since I am always outshined by her.) She is also my only close friend I have here in Norton and probably one of my closest friends period. Which will bring me to the next rant. . .

3. Friends, what I am lacking of here in Norton (I have some in Clintwood) I lack the courage and the nerve to actually say hi to people! WHY! WHY?!?!? I am not always a meek and mild person, I am not normally quiet or shy, normally I am loud (almost always serious tho) but. . . Stupid me can never do anything right, if I do it at all.
I will have to talk to people since Naomi is going. . . I won't have anyone. But things at Tech are a bit better than Norton. I talk to the people in my class some actually. I still am not real talkative, but I will actually open my mouth. Its great. On Friday I got to be paired up with AJ and tour about 30 Powell Valley 8th graders around the school. We had to bring a map with us so we wouldn't get lost. We went everywhere, but it was nice getting to talk to him and hang out with him. The teachers from Powell Valley and a few of the teachers from Tech thought we were 8th graders! 8th GRADERS! THAT IS AWFUL! I CANT HELP I AM SHORT! DONT MAKE FUN OF ME! XD Hopefully I will get the courage to talk to AJ and get his MSN or something. . . and maybe if I get a lot of courage actually ask him out one day. *Crosses fingers*

5. I got to go to Clintwood on Tuesday or Wednesday. Well anyway, I had a dentists appointment and afterwards I got to go and spend 2nd lunch at clintwood! It was so nice seeing everyone, all my friends and some of my favorite teachers. It really made my day! I was so happy! I will do it again next time I have a day off and am near clintwood.

6. I have to get my learners this or next month! I am gonna be studying all this week and am gonna take the test this weekend. . .hopefully I will pass!

7. My Senior trip is gonna be to NYC in October. I can't wait! Its gonna be so so so much fun!

8. I might go to NC with my Dad when he goes to Raleigh for a meeting about his cancer. Hopefully I can go and see all my family.

9. BIG NEWS! Some friends from FL are going to KY  about an hour away from here in July and we are going to see them. I haven't seen them in 6 years or more. I was friends with the 2 oldest, Alisha (who is now an adult 20 I think) and Daniel (who is 17 I think, guy I was in love with when I was little) I am really excited about seeing them all!

Nothing big is happening with me. Had to go to school, cause I am a Skills USA officer while noone else had to. . . .:P I helped out in the concession stand and had to do this whole meeting thing. But I got to see Clintwoodians!! (Repeating myself. . . :P)

I am doing well in my classes. Still don't have anyone else to sit with at lunch besides Naomi, but she will live. . . I am getting along with people a little better in my drafting class, someone besides A.J. and Mr. Miller have said something to me.

I am gonna start architecture in drafting soon. Mr. Miller started giving us notes and stuff on it. I am so happy bout that. I found out we are gonna have to do plans for all the property and buildings that the school owns. It is gonna be hard, but really fun! I am really looking forward to it.

I am talking to lots of people from different countries on some forums I go to. . .its so much fun. Especially when they know what you mean when you say you're an otaku. . . :D

"event","I don't feel like sleeping right now. I should be in bed sleeping because I have to go to church tomorrow, but I just feel like sitting here saying things that I need to get off my chest, because it feels like noone really listens. . .

Naomi just left a few minutes ago. She came to tell me a few things about her life. She told me all about her friends and all, and about all her guy friends. She keeps talking about them and even about some friends she has made in my grade. I can't help but feel a bit envious. She goes, ""I know how scared and awkward you feel I felt it the first day"" and ""you should talk to people and make friends"". . . She is right but. . .

Right now I feel so lonely. . .I can't seem to stop crying for the life of me (believe me I hate crying) I can't help feeling this deep ache inside of me that just won't seem to go away. . . Me having such a hard time making friends and talking to others is not just because of some scared feeling, it goes way beyond that. . . it is pure and utter terror for me, I am unsure of myself, and I just don't know. . . I keep putting up a brave face and saying I am okay, but I am starting not to believe myself.

All my friends. . especially my Clintwood ones don't know how important they are to me. . . my friends are to me like parts of my family and its just so hard. . .

Forgive me for my emotional drama that I wrote. . its one of those things I hate, being an emotional female teenager. It took me 30 some min to write just this much. . . but I guess I am starting to feel good enough to go to bed. . . so good night!"

"event","Hey ya'll! I have made it thru another week. . . 

I had some English tests this week. I actually did well on them. 99 on my Isms test (rationalism, deism, and puritanism) I made a 94 on my literary terms test cause I forgot to answer a question.

Chemistry is getting tough. Light and electrons and all that. It goes WHOOSH!! right over my head! A pain in the neck let me tell you. . . I got to play with fire today in a lab! Yay! It was so fun. But it was a pain and I was so scared that I would burn me or something else! I had to burn different kinds of salt and see what color it burned. . .it was really cool!

Drafting is pretty good. My teacher is so cool! He is hilarious! I have been working on this really hard drawing and I finally have it done all I gotta do is dimension it. We had a pizza day today in drafting. Stupid me I ate lunch at school. But oh well. I was so chicken to talk so basically I just sat, listened to conversations and the guitar, and then listened to my mp3 player I finally brought it. I am glad I did. Afterward A.J. told me that if I would talk to some people they would actually talk to me. I am scared of people most of the time, I am as social as a hermit, and I have Foot-in-Mouth disease. Open mouth, insert foot. . .GRRR!!!! 

I am so proud of Naomi right now too. . . she is joining the phorensics team. her stories are so good. Drama queen is her middle name too. 

Thanks for listen to my rants. . .

I love these things!!!

"event","Well, lets see. . . I have made it thru 2 weeks of school barely. What should I tell first the bad news, or the news that is good, that there isn't much of. . .

Okay bad news first. . .
1. I am depressed, pretty bad too. It doesn't seem like things are going well for me at all really. I came home yesterday and just cried. 
2. No FRIENDS!!! ITS KILLING ME!!! Being a social outcast is normal for me but 
even so I have friends. I actually tried talking to someone. . . but that bombed. I just suck at being social. I just stay quiet and blend into the corner.
3. Naomi is mad at me. She is tired that I have noone to hang out with and I eat lunch with her. Yesterday she got mad at me because I stuck my stuff in her locker that I had to bring home. She just acted really rude and mean. I cussed her out tho, so I got in trouble yesterday.
4. I hate my English class. . . I despise, and I mean DESPISE writing.
5. My dad is telling me that if I don't stop cussing that he will take my computer away. . 

Good Things
1. I am making good grades so far.
2. I like my teachers.
3. I actually have someone who says hi to me in my drafting class.
4. I talk a lil on my vokie bus. . .

I pray actually that next week will be better! Syonara!"

"event","Man, this is so so so weird! I am updating for the third day in a row. . .a new record of my actually doing something consistently!!!!
Hahahaha!!!

I am so confused over whether or not I like the new school. I like the classes (except for English 11, BLAH!!!) But I still have. . .no friends! I am such a chicken, I keep quiet and act shy since I don't know what else to do. Just that new people scare me. I don't know whats wrong with me.

I got a quiz in English tomorrow (UGH!) And I had to actually start writing a journal for the class, I hate, and I mean HATE writing. Especially if I am supposed to be creative. . .

Chemistry ROCKS!!! At least so far. . . we got to do a lab today. We used this copper chloride stuff water and aluminum foil and it boiled and got hot, it was pretty cool. The teacher then gave us this lotion stuff and we rubbed it on out hands and we went into the closet and put our hands under a blacklight showed us all the germs on our hands (we just finished washing them after cleaning the lab up) it is called glowgerm or germglow or something like that. BTW, I think I told everyone that the teacher was hott. . .for all greenwaves he lives there adn drives everday to where I am at. . he had biology under Brother Deel if you can believe it. . .

We had a prom meeting to to see if anyone wanted to buy these glasses or picture frames. Well, going to the prom is gonna cost $80 a person. . . I really wanted to go. . .at CLINTWOOD!!!! But I still wanna go, even if its here, but $80 is a lot, I have no date (probably couldn't get one), and the dress I have isn't exactly prom. . short and everything, and I look aweful in it. . .But I still REALLY WANNA GO!!! 

I ate lunch . . .I forgot to pay the lunch lady, I hope she forgets. . .*crosses fingers*

Drafting was okay. . . I kinda got the thing about drawing isometric drawings, hopefully I will understand it all by next week. Oh and they have a Gatorade machine at Vokie! I love it! Someone from my class actually talked to me. . .I forget his name but I am glad that someone actually said something to me. 

My dad actually came and got me and Naomi from school today! I am happy I didn't have to walk. The sad thing was I found out after the car that he wasn't feeling well and was using a cane. . .just about broke my heart. I feel bad I asked hime to come and get us. . .

Well I am gonna do something else, my dad wants to know about my day. . .

BTW, The person who invented the saying ""Silence is Golden"" must've rode my bus back from Vokie! Those little heathens gave me a headache."

"event","Hey peoples! I am actually updating my journal again, its not like I have anything important to say but oh well, if you are on here you should read it anyway!

I am not claustrophobic in my English class anymore, YAY!!!! They split the class in half!!! YAY!!!! HOORAY FOR THE LAWS OF THE LAND!!!! And come to think of it one or two of the guys are kinda cute too. . .but I got homework. . .GRR!!! and I am gonna have to start writing tomorrow. . . GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!

One of the local clubs at my school is doing this most compatible thing for Valentines day. I can't wait to see who I am most compatible with. . LOL!!! ME and a GUY actually compatible???? Whoda thunk it??? We filled those out durign my Chemistry class (which I found out was Advanced Chem. too) and I helped hand those forms out to the other classes, I got lost too. Me dumb. . . Did I tell you that the teacher is one of the hottest I have ever seen? Weird for teachers . . .LoL

I went to Drafting again it was fine. . .nothing much happened but I did get all my homework finished. Isometric drawings are GRRRRR!!!! You know what, did I tell you my bus driver to vokie is so slow that we have to go on another bus to get to the high school (we get there half an hour before him). . .I think I did. . .but anyways I had to ride the other bus and man it was NOISY!!! I am so glad I haven't rode one of the annoying cheese wagons but now I have too. Today since the other girl who rides it too wasn't here, I was the only other person besides the bus driver over the age of 14! AGGGHHHH!! ALL THE YELLING AND SCREAMING MAKES MY HEAD HURT!!!!

Well I actually did this stupid thing, I rode the bus to the park, I mean by the time I got to the park (half a mile from my house too) I could've been home and on the computer. . .we went all over the town. But Naomi's new friend Ashley (seems like a really nice girl) lives like a few houses down from my house so Naomi and I walked home with her.

Still no friends exactly but I met this girl named Jenna she seems nice (but shes in the 9th grade) I dunno. . .

"event","Greetings to all who know me and love me! And I know that is everyone!

Starting a new school is tuff stuff! Today was my second day of school and my first day where I actually went to all three of my classes. . .
Before I tell you about today I will tell you all about last week to tell catch you all up, a little. . .

Well all last week was mostly boring, thinking I had a week off was fun but sitting at a computer all day after the 4th day gets a little boring especially when you are running out of things to do, or at least think you are. 

Well guess what to all my fans out there, I got my hair cut short on Thurs. and I mean short. Chin-length short, Naomi kept bugging me about getting my hair cut into a ""short, choppy, bob"" (she now tells me I look more feminine, load of bull) and sadly she bugged me so much I actually listened to her, I should've gone with my instincts and not given up my beautiful long hair. You actually have to style it and all and it doesn't look that good on me, but hair grows so eventually it will be long and beautiful again.

Well that was Thurs. and then Friday, we went to the school to set up my and Naomi's new schedule. Well my schedule consists of English 11, Chemistry, and Drafting at the local vocational school. Well it seems that the vocational school is in a different county, so the vocational school was still in school so I went home grabbed some nasty food to eat (we had nothing good to eat) and went back to the school to pick up the vokie bus at 12:10.  Well I get to the vocational school. . walk into the Drafting classroom and to my surprise. . NO GIRLS!! Yes all I am stuck in a Drafting class with 13 guys who I do not know. . .my nightmare, people in general I do not like and aren't comfortable around unless I know them and guys are even worse. Especially when you have some of the shortest hair among them. They seem alright though for now. The Teacher tho is something else, his name is Mr. Miller funniest craziest most hyper old dude I have ever met. He is awesome! and so nice too! During break time, he took me around and introduced me to the staff and saying things like ""this is Newberry's favorite drafting student who we stole"" or ""Newberry's having a cow since we stole one of his best students."" It was embarressing but also very funny. I was so so so scared tho that day and very worried about the next first week of school. I met one girl named Sheena but really noone else. (only 6 people from my new school go to vokie)

Well Saturday and Sunday were blah days, did nothing except go to church with my family. Monday was the first day of school. Say yay for snow!!!! Well the school was delayed 1 1/2 hours because of the snow. . .so I got up at 5 for nothing, and when I first get up and get awake I have a hard time going back to bed, so I got ready and all that and once I found out about the delays I went on the computer for a while and then went to sleep for a few min til it was time to leave. Thankfully tho, the county where I go to vocational was only closed so I only had a half day as well. . .Well I get to school, and they have this stupid rule where you have to stay in the cafeteria til the bell rings so Naomi and I are sitting there in the middle front of the cafeteria (sticking out like a sore thumb)and we were trying our darndest to forget how nervous we were by talking (Naomi was actually shaking and me too a lil) then the bell rang and there was an assembly so everyone went to that. So the assembly droned on and on, the principal wouldn't stop talking and then he made all the new students stand (EMBARESSING!!!!) finally we were dismissed to our classes. I get to my English class and sit in a corner off to the side to try and be by myself (my loner tendencies) and then all of a sudden the class fills up, there were only like 2 seats empty. And thankfully we did nothing (since she was gonna make up write and I hate writing) except get our books and folders. . .Well then was Chemistry, there are only 5 people in there including me and basically all we did was just nothing we took one page of notes but it wan't anything much. But I got to go home after that (at noon!!!!) and was bored for most of the day, again.
Thank God that my dad took us to school!!!! I had a sneaking suspicion tho when I got home that I was near some really young people at my locker, Naomis locker should be mine and mine should be Naomis. . . 

Well then today happened. . .Dad took us to school. We sat again in the middle front in the cafeteria. . .when the bell rang we went to our classes again, thankfully we didn't do much in English besides a grammar and spelling sheet (easy stuff) because the teacher was really unorganized, oh and my claustraphobic antisocial disorder became worse when 3 new people came into the class, they even had to get an extra desk. . .Then there was Chemistry, we went over another quick section, we had a few notes, and we had a page to do and we have a quiz tomorrow not too bad tho. Well then we had lunch (my first lunch at the school) Since I still didn't have any friends I ate with my sister and her new friends, I don't think that she enjoyed me being there that much, she was mostly ignoring me too. Well I hurried and ate and went to vokie bus. Well we get to vokie, and I get to the classroom, hardly anyone is there except for this one guy, and noone comes until the class is half over, I do one drawing and stay in during break, it wasn't too bad but still rather boring. It was better tho than Friday. We get back on the bus we have to switch buses and wait in the cold since our regular driver is so slow. . .I had to WALK home!!! It was so freezing around 15 degrees and we had to walk 3/5 of a mile, I couldn't have made it without getting a pop to drink, but the pop was cold but it was still warmer than the air!! By the time I got home my finger tips were so cold they were burning and stinging. 

Well there is a chance for snow tomorrow and if there is snow there is now way in he** I am walking to school.

Well I think this is long enough. My fingers are starting to hurt and everyone should give me cheese for writing such a long entry and trying to get over being a lazya**!

TTYL!"

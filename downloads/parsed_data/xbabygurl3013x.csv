"event","so after school yesterday..i went home and typed my forensics paper went back to school to give it to mrs. vrana cuz it was due by the end of the day n i never knew about it.  then i went to the bank to take out money and then i went home and went straight to the hair place to get my hair done for prom!  i got it half up and half down with all curls and two pieces curled in the front.  then i went to the nail saloon and got my manicure.  i used the same color as i did for my pedicure which was guadelupe opal..it looked awesome.  then i waited for my mom to get out of a&p because she was buying stuff.  then i went home and did my makeup and put my dress on n took pictures with my family.  then everyone came over and cristin stopped by and we took a pic together.  first erikas fam came, then cristin, then erika n nick, then chrissy, then vigo, then kristen and matt, then jenna, trisha, wally, and kelly came.  we all took pictures infront of my house with the group and our families.  then it started raining so we ran into our cars to go to school to meet up with the limo since it was there since like 330 and we werent paying for that.  so we got to the school and took pics.  me and jaime took a few pictures together and kristen and hallat met up with us.  then after we all finished taking pictures..we went into our limo and we were all like sitting on top of eachother because we had no room.  then we got to prom and had so much fun.  the girls at our lunch table took a group pic together with the xception of a few ppl that were in it n not in it.  then we all danced and had a lot of fun.  jenna and vigo looked soo cute together.  i'm glad that jenna had a fun nite because the last thing that i would have wanted was for her to be upset.  i'm glad that i ended up going with wally to prom because i had so much fun with him.  it was kind of awkward but things worked out well so its all good.  jeff got me to swing dance w/ him and i thought i was going to fall on the floor because i was in so much pain and the music was too fast..but i kept up with it.  the food was good and our limo and table had so much fun!  jess was prom queen and mike and matt were tied for prom king.  i'm glad that they won because they deserved it.  zach did the dance from the fresh prince of belair and it was hilarious.  that kid is crazy but i love him..its weird not having him in school, but hes gonna be a teacher so he does his field work at school so its all good.  after prom was over...we all got back into the limo and were basically on top of eachother again and we took forever to get to post prom because our limo driver had no idea where he was going and we got lost as did all of the other limos that were following ours.  finally, we got to post prom and i realized that i didnt have sneakers with me so i went barefoot the whole time as i did at prom too.  we played an ""intense"" game of violent tennis w/ the lights off and we watched part of a hypnotist/comedian show and we took pictures and watched people play dodge ball.  i was kind of mad n upset because of something..but its all good cuz its not worth it.  after post prom we took the 430 bus home instead of the 330 bus becuz vigo and wally wanted to stay later, but we had fun ne way.  we took the 430 bus and b4 that i told every1 that i might jus go home and jenna knew something was wrong..she always knows wen somethings wrong w/ me as i do w/ her...shes like my sister n we r really close and we know wen one of us aren't ourselves.  wen we took the bus i kept dosing off n then woke up n finally wen i woke up the last time we were like 5 mins away from school.  jenna n vigo sat together, i sat by myself, nick sat w/ someone, and wally n erika sat together.  wen i got off the bus i told jenna i was going home and theresa was driving me.  so me n theresa had a long talk on our short ride home.  finally she dropped me off n went home.  i got home at 521 and went to sleep right away..i woke up a few times n kept going back to sleep. nd finally i woke up at 130 and got ready for brett's graduation party.  we left at like 200 to go there.  wen i got there i chilled with jeremy, chrisy, chelsea, kyle, nick, tracy, my brother, and my sister and brett.  some of brett's other friends were there like danny quach(one of my good friends),sam, mike, chico, dave, matt, erica, and some other people.  we all had a lot of fun together.  then james, jeremy, and chrisy left as did my dad, sister, and brother a lil bit b4 them.  i was basically falling asleep half the time i was there.  jeremy told me that i look dead because he's never seen me like this b4.  he told me that i should go home n sleep n not go out tonite n go to six flags tomorro.  well i got home at like 1025 and decided that im not going to six flags tomorro because i'm not gonna be up by 800 wen every1 wants to leave so i told kristen that wen she called me.  i dont think i'm going to be going out ne where tonite unless someone calls me even tho its kind of late to go out, but w/e.  i'm mad tired and i'm going to sleep.  tomorro i'm going to get some of my pictures developed from prom and hopefully get some double a batteries so i can put them in my digital camera since the battery died yesterday and that way i can put the pics from my digital camera onto the computer.

"event","so im sitting in math class in room 170 ""attempting"" to work on my math final that is due on wednesday and im no where near done with it.  it's really bad because i've been procrastinating and i really need to get it done and i can't have an extension.  i just finished my spanish hw for the stupid bitch spanish teacher that claims that i ""need to take the rest of the class seriously"" yea ok..thats bullshit because i do take the class seriously.  i want a good grade for fourth quarter and for the course so i always take it seriously..im one of the only kids that do well on tests n quizzes n does my homework.  i think thats taking the class seriously.  then i dont wanna take the regents..thats my business..not hers or ne 1 elses because its my life. my choice. my decision.not ne 1 elses!!  so last night wally imed me and questioned me about if i was happy to go with him to prom and if i said something because he was ""just wondering"". yea ok im so sure of that one because he wouldnt have randomly just asked me that on wednesday night when prom is on friday.  he must have heard it somewhere or from someone..idk who tho.  im so sick of this bullshit baby drama tho because seriously..don't talk shit if u dont know the facts..don't open ur mouth if u don't know the truth because it really causes a lot of trouble.  now my prom night is gonna be ruined because hes pissed off at me and we are either going to argue or i'm just not going to have a good time because i know that he is mad at me.  it's not that i don't want to go with him because i really do wanna go with him, but it's just that theres a lot on my mind and its all getting to me making me not want to go at all just like how i felt in the beginning wen i didn't want to go at all.  something always gets in the way...there's never a dull moment im tellin you.  it's gonna be an awkward night..but who cares because its gonna be awesome!  jenna imed me last night being really upset because she realized that she still has feelings for jamez which hello i already knew that but she kept denying it so i just went along with it.  she likes jd now too and i told her that she can't have both and she needs to decide, but i also told her that if she had a problem with me talking to jamez that she should have told me in the beginning.  me and him have known eachother for a while and hes my best friend, but we hardly talk ne more so it wouldn't really change ne thing if she told me to stop talkin to him because i would stop talking ne way.  i don't like to hurt my friends..especially my best friends.  i never takes sides because i can't be put in that position.  i hate when that happens.  and i was in the same position she was in...n is in.  n no1 understands that i felt the same way wen she first met him and shit..and did ne of them care?nope not at all..because no1 cared about my feelings.  well u kno wut u cnt make people do stuff they dont wanna do...u cant control people.  so w/e...idk how to help her i've tried so many times but idk wut to do or say because everything i say is going to make her cry more and get more upset than she already is.  well yea..ne way..i realized that u have to think about other people other than urself when u are in those situations because everyones world doesn't revolve around you or me.  it revolves around themselves.  seriously..is there ne way that drama n fighting n arguing n all this other baby bullshit will ever stop?seriously..cmon now...everyone should be friends and get along...is that ever going to happen?  ne way..i took my english final last period and its really easy.  i'm almost done with it.  i'm going to finish it during studyhall 7th period in the library and sit with brin, britt, laura, and possibly arielle if she decides to not be a weirdo and be scared that my sister isn't talking to her.  wow arielle is really a big drama queen and she needs to stop bein such a bitch.  u talk about someone especially someone in my family like my sister or one of her friends...and u dont expect them to find out about it..well reality check..THEY WILL!! because everything gets back to everyone and brewster is a very small town and word gets around very quickly.  so after school im going to get my pedicure...my dad's driving me bc my apptmnt is at 2:00 and then im going to work at 445 because im working 5-cl(9) prolly wont get out til about 915 or so depending on what time patty let's us out.  i wish allison was closing tonite but thats not happening.  and since cathy changed the hours for work..she changed my hours for good..which really sux because i liked my mondays.  maybe she will give me back my mondays n not put me on thursdays.  hopefully i will have mondays n saturdays back after this month because i hate my new schedule.  i dont like always having saturdays so occasionally its ok if theres a change...but not all the time.  i guess this is my punishment for taking four saturdays off in a row!!i also have to pack my bag for post prom and yea..idk..i have so much to do and so little time to do it!ahhh this is soooo stressful!!well the bells gonna ring in 5 mins and i have to go to my next class...economics w. windas woohoo not!  i hate that bitch..shes a horrible teacher.  shes a nice person but thats about it.  i have to watch boring presentations...how fun!

"event","i went to jfk to meet with ms. goetz and talk to her about how i liked working with her and the kids there this year.  I honestly loved working with them this year. all three of my classes were awesome and the kids were fun to work with and very adorable.  they were really nice and they were comfortable with me as i was with them so thats a good thing.  ms. goetz was awesome to work with too because i learned a lot from her and she helped me to see what it was like to work in a school setting with kids.  i taught health and all of the topics that were included in it.  the kids loved it and so did i.  i enjoyed working with everyone at jfk on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays and i'm going to miss all of them a lot.  it was a great experience that i will never forget.  Then we got to talking about college and everything.  then i went home and watched some tv then wen to go pick up my sister and brother from school because they stayed after.  then i came home and later on went to get my eyebrows waxed with my mom n we got ingredients for the punch that she is making on friday for everyone who comes to take pictures and stuff for prom.  we made my pedicure appointment for tomorrow right wen i get out of school and my manicure appointment for 2:00 on friday after i get my hair done so i will have time.  my mom's appointment is then too.  i decided that i am getting guadelupe opal on my nails and toe nails because it would go well with my dress.  then i came home and did my forensics paper and my english response paper and worked on my math final thats due next wednesday..ahh all this work is really stressing me out.  prom is on friday and im really excited..trisha and lucy are coming to ny tomorro nite n staying in queens and then they are coming to brewster on friday!i cnt wait to see them because i haven't seen them since sometime after i went to their house in january during midterm week with jenna and christine.  They came sometime after that tho.  i miss them so much. i was supposed to go to visit them on spring break with jenna, daniele, and kelly, but that didn't work out..but i'm not gonna get into that because thats a long story.  we figured mostly everything out for prom now so yea...i guess we just have to wait and see about everything else.  well im gonna go n do some homework and some of my math final..fun!~stina xoxo"

"event","<P>Friday i drove jenna home and then i came home and stayed in the rest of the night because i was really tired and i knew i had to get up really early the next day. my sister's friends came over and we all hung out for a lil while wen they got back from the movies. my neighbors were also over so it was fun. Saturday i went to msmc for placement tests and took 4 tests. Daria, Gina, Chrissy, Alyssa, and I took the last 2 tests together. Daria and I shared my calculator during the 2nd to last test. we all came to the conclusion that the kid in the red shirt was cute!lol. college is going to be so much fun with these girls and jenna, bella, janine, laur, and everyone else! then i went to my cousin's memorial picnic..it was fun to be around my family and my cousins, but it was also really sad because i miss my cousin so much and its so hard to see his family because all i want to do is cry. their lives are never going to be the same. none of our lives will be. its been a little bit over a year since it happened, but i still can't believe that he's gone. he was only 16 wen it happened. we raised a lot of money for the scholarship for a wrestler and to open up a place where other chidren can be help. then i came home and went online and then layed down in my bed for the rest of the night because i wasn't in the mood to do ne thing at all. i was supposed to go to the ics carnival with seb but that didn't end up happening. Sunday i woke up with another allergic reaction n took some benadryl n went to work from 12-7 with allison, kristen, johnathan, and joe. we all have a lot of fun wen we work together because we don't do anything and we do whatever we want. Allison told me about her friends and what happened and i felt horrible because she has been thru so much with guys and this one was really important to her and hes in the hospital and she has been really upset. I hope everything worked out with his surgery and all. He is going to be ok tho. Allison has always been there for me thru everything and she knows im always going to be there for her. she is going to come and visit me and janine at college!lol. i came home n took more benadryl then went to sleep. Monday was senior picnic and i went to school to get my yearbook n left wen every1 was boarding the buses to go to picnic because i wasn't feeling well n i was still very tired from the benadryl that i had before i went to school and i was feeling dizzy n my reaction was getting worse. so i went home and slept all day and then erika came over to show me her prom dresses and then we went to A&amp;P to meet up with nick and we ended up seeing maxine, kate, and purdy there. Then erika dropped me off and i came home and did homework. well today was tiring. i went to school and basically sat thru every class not doing ne thing at all. Senioritis is really getting to me. I've been doing all my work, but i've been waiting til the last minute to do it all. I've gotten to the point where I don't want to do any work at all..and im def. not taking my spanish regents n i honestly don't care about what my spanish teacher has to say about it. she doesn't control me and she sure as hell isn't my mother. Yesterday, i drove jenna home after school and then came home and went to my cousin's baseball game for a little while. him and his brother are so adorable and they are very fun to be around. After that, i went to jenna's chorus awards and watched her and the rest of the seniors sing a song in which jenna and lenore had solos in. They did a really good job! Prom is in a few days...i can't wait because its going to be fun, but then somethings making me not want to go and i really dont know why. Jenna's going with Vigo and I'm going with Wally so we all will have a lot of fun. Graduations on the way soon and its gonna be really sad because I'm not going to see a lot of my friends for a while. Jenna and I are going to the same college(MSMC 09' yea bitchesz) so its gonna be fun. Jenna is into someone, Christine has her guy now, and me..i dont know whats going on right now. I've been so stressed out lately and everyone has been giving me advice on what to do n stuff..but idk..something keeps telling me not to say anything to anyone. Schools over on wednesday..woohoo!&nbsp; I talked to Jamez and Armando last night and they got me thinking about a lot of things.&nbsp; Jamez and I had a really long conversation for the first time in a while.&nbsp; I feel like I can talk to him about ne thing and everything. he is one of my best friends and is always there for me just like i am for him.&nbsp; well i gotta go..at school going to jfk. *i'll see wut happens today*</P>"

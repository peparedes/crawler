"event","After cheering on Wednesday, Cenzie, Cecilee and I went to the store where my mommy works and tried to sell the rest of our Skowhegan Football cards.  We were sitting in the store eating pizza and talking when a Lake George Ranger came in.  Cecilee looked at him when he walked by and goes HEY ITS RANGER JOE! (Like on Full House) and when ""ranger joe"" walked back he came over to us and was like ""by the way...Its ranger Bob."" We were laughing so hard.  I didnt even think he heard Cec say that.  Man it was too funny.  We ended up going around Canaan and selling the cards to stores and stuff like that.  We walked up the roads near my house too, we sold all of them by the end of the day.  We then went to Derek's house to use the big trampoline to practice jumps on.  Erika was watching Little Erika and of corse little Erika had to come and join us.  Shes so cute.  We went back to my house and hung out.  Mechanzie left later on.  Cec slept over and went to the mall with Danica and I today.  Got some more stuff for school.  Cheering tomorrow from 7-12.  Then maybe the game in Bangor with Cecilee??? Still not sure yet."

So there was like no escaping it. haha.  Anyways, Today Glen came over and hung out for a bit.  Later on my mom and I went to the store and I got to drive up my road yay! Haha Im mad because like everyone already has there permits! I am going in September, I really think that is a bad time to go...but I have to go sometime right?  But in September school just started, I have cheering, I have dance, just hope I can handle adding one more thing.  But oh well its only for 3 weeks so I will survive. 

Tomorrow I have cheering from 7-12 then Cecilee and Cenzie are coming over after to practice jumps.  So adios until then."

"event","Today I had to get up and go to cheer practice at 7, my mom and I picked up Becka on the way.  Practice went good. We got our ""Secret Football Players"", I got some kid I dont even know.  Oh well, the whole thing sounds like fun, even though I still dont understand why WE have to buy stuff for a football player and give him something every day of Homecoming week.  I bet it wont even occur to the football players to do something nice back and at least give us a card or something to show they appreciate it.  Im not sure why I am complaining, so I will stop now.  After practice I went to Becka's house and hung out there until around 4ish.  Oodles and Noodles are the best Becka ;).  We finally got our TV straightened around today, which is good.  I still hate Sat. Dishes tho, much rather have regular cable, o well, once again I am complaining.  I am kinda excited for school to start now, I really wish the summer lasted longer tho.  I just want to go back to school to: Wear new clothes, start dance and cheering (officially), and to see everyone I have missed over the summer!  Well Im out for now."

Ours is like always messing up and stuff, its quite annoying.  So they came and didnt do much, we still have like no channels and our TV is still messed up. Ohhh well.  So once my mom got out of work I went to Waterville with her.  Went into Maurices and got a new sweater and shirt, really cute.  I didnt get anything else, I wasnt in the ""shopping mood"".  Once I got home I watched some movie on one of the VERY FEW channels we have left on our televison.  It was Cash and Tango.  I usually am not like CRAZY about action movies, but I will still watch them, but this one was really really good.  Anyways who knows whats happening tomorrow."

"event","Ok practice went well today.  I feel so bad for poor Jody, I know it killed her to have to sit out!  We went to Al's pizza for lunch, which was good since I was like starving.  Then over to Tire Ware House for the Car Wash.  We made a good amount of money I think, which is good.  We almost caused an accident tho!  We were on the side walk with signs and some guy on a motorcycle was staring at us, and a truck pulled out in front of him, but he didnt realize this because he was too busy looking at us.  Thank goodness he realized that truck pulled out before he smashed into it.  I had fun screaming at the cars and stuff, now lets hope I have a voice for tomorrow.  Once I came back home I slept for a bit, practice and the car wash wore me out.  I have no idea what I am doing tomorrow."

"event","Hey all
Got back from camping on Sunday afternoon.  Had lots of fun and lots of good times.  We went to different places like Clark's and the waterslides.  I never realized how mountainy New Hampshire is!  I know that sounds really dumb but oh well.  Cecilee's Poppy and Glenny liked to make fun of me for saying that.  But it is really pretty there.  The campsite had like a river and trails right in it and stuff so that was pretty cool.  Went swimming alot, leave it to me, I fell on a rock and cut my ankle like the first day we were there.  Im such a clutz!  Oh well, Cecilee decided to be weird and go on a skateboard with no shoes on...so obviously she fell and scrapped her foot.  She was fine until Glen looked at it and it looked like the bone was sticking out. Nice one Glenny.  I had lots of fun.

On Monday Savanna, Danica and I went to the fair after I had cheering practice.  Had fun.  I watched the Durby...that was one of the first times I have actually sat down and watched that.  I never thought that watching cars crash into each other would be so entertaining.  It was really cool though!  I guess I shouldnt judge things so quickly.  But anyways, after the fair Vanna and Danni came back to my place and slept over.  Vanna left pretty early in the morning so Danni and I hung out on Tuesday.

Today I had to get up to go to Cheering.  Went pretty good except poor Jody hurt her foot. I hope she gets better soon!  Glen came over for awhile after practice.  I am pretty tired tonight...Yes...I get to sleep-in in the morning, I dont have to watch Erika since she is going to Bible school for the week.

Adios for now."

"event","Today I had to watch Erika for a while.  We decided today we were going to paint our nails and do all kinds of girly stuff like that.  So we went over to my house for awhile and did that.  Then I couldnt open a bottle of nail polish and decided to call Derek since we saw him pull into his house...and I asked him to come and open a bottle of nail polish for me...he wasnt too happy about that but he still did it.  Later on I went to the mall with Danica, her mom, and her foster sister.  Danica and I had quite the exciting day at the mall.  We went into Filenes and I bought a skirt and she bought a blazer, when we exited the store to go back into the mall...the alarm went off.  But no one stopped us so we just kept walking.  Then later when we were getting ready to meet her mom and sister out in the car (we had to walk through Filenes because we parked outside that store)  when we entered the store...the alarm went off again!  Once again...no one stopped us so we just kept walking.  And when we went through the final door and got out into the parking lot...the alarm went off AGAIN...so you can say that me and Danica were freaking out.  So we basically ran to the car and locked the doors once inside...just as soon as we did that...a security car flew around the parking lot...(by then Danica and I were in tears).  We had noooo clue why the alarm was going off!  We had slips for everything we bought!  It wasnt like we stole something!  So when Danica's mom and sister arrived...we told them what happened and her mom made us take out everything we bought at Filenes and check to see if a ink tag was left on it.  That whole time...the cashier didnt take off the ink tag when I payed for my skirt!  I was too scared to go back into the store and tell them what happened so Danica's Mommy was happy to do it for me.  Thank Goodness!  She came back and everything was fine...the Filenes people understood.  Lets just say Danica and I will be checking to see if the ink tag is left on our new clothes more often...that scared us soooo much, you dont even know!  But over all the mall was really fun, I always have a good time with Danni!  

This will be my last entry for awhile...I am going camping with Cecilee and her family until the 14th in New Hampshire.  Should be fun.  I just hate packing!  I always pack wayyy to much and I always foget a bunch of things.  So adios until then!"

"event","Today was okay I guess.  Had to go and watch Erika until Derek got home.  Then I went back to my house and layed out by the pool and read...so maybe I could kinda get a tan?!?  Don't know if that worked or not.  Last night I had to explain like the whole movie Blow to Jaclyn.  She said she didn't like the movie...but then she only saw parts of it.  So she was asking all these questions about it and seemed pretty interested, for not liking the movie. LoL.  I thought that movie was really good.  I am usually not into drug movies and stuff but that was pretty good.  It made it more interesting knowing that the movie was based on a true story.  Plus it had Johnny Depp in it so...you know it had to be good.  Now Jaclyn got me thinking about it...so I wanna read a book on it.  I found one called- Blow: How a Small-Town Boy Made $100 Million with the Medellin Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All, by Bruce Porter and I think I wanna order it sometime.  Not that I am interested in learning about drugs but the whole concept of the movie was pretty interesting, so maybe I will try the book?  Okay enough of that.

Tomorrow I have to watch Erika again until Derek gets home, then I am off to the mall with Danica to start school shopping...man I havent even started yet!  I am so ready to go shop.

That hampster face I have is the cutest thing ever! I am not even full...I just love the hampster face! LoL."

"event","I havent updated this for awhile...sorry!  On Sunday I went to the races with Cecilee.  AJ did awesome as usual!  Monday I ran errands with my mom then read alot.  I have been reading like constantly lately.  I read my whole book yesterday, it was really good. It was The Last Vampire By Christopher Pike.  Its the first book out of the Last Vampire series...I think there is six of them...but anyways Christopher Pike is like the best author in the world.  Then today I had to get up and go to the doctors for a physical...yuk.  I was really nervous cuz I hate the doctors and I had to have a guy this time.  I dont know why...He was the only one avaiable I guess.  Thank god I didnt have to take off any of my clothes...He just basically did stuff that required  me to actually show that I am capable of living haha.  He was like asking all these questions.  He was like ya now its time for the akward questions that the guy doctor has to ask.  Have u has sex?  Do u plan to? Blah Blah Blah...it was weird and i could tell that the doctor was soooo uncomfortable asking.  It was funny. But now i am at cecilee's house and we are going to head over to her Nanny and Poppy's house in a bit.  Adios for now."

"event","Today I got up and walked across the street to watch Erika.  I fell back asleep and had really odd dreams...One of them was that there was this Island that was underwater and cats lived there...and I was taking a tour of the Island...underwater.  Really Weird. I think I had that dream because Erika's cat decided to sleep right on top of me. Then I woke up to Erika, 2 inches from my face telling me to wake up.  I love how she decides to get right up in my face.  We watched the Price is Right and ate breakfast as usual. GOD FOREBID THAT WE CHANGE OUR MORNING RITUAL.  We heard a dirtbike outside and thought it was Jake so I told Erika to go answer the door cuz I didnt wanna deal with him since he doesnt like me or whatever.  It turned out to be Rachel so I had to run to the door to say Hi to her.  What a nice babysitter I am, I tell the kid to go answer the door...for all we know it could be a masked murdurer or a kidnapper or something...but we got something worse...RACHEL! haha jk rachel. Then her friend Brittany called and wanted her to come over to play.  Everything was all worked out so that Erika was going to get picked up and go over there...which was fine with me cuz i got to go home lol.  So I went home and slept for a bit since I was sooo tired, then mom came home and wanted me to go shopping with her.  So we went to Fairfield and went out to eat at the Purple Cow.  We decided to eat before going shopping cuz we would buy everything in sight if we went grocery shopping while hungry haha.  We went and did that and I saw Mr. Fitz the best teacher in the world into Walmart.  He looks so good and I hope he feels better!  It was nice to see him, I miss him alot.  Weird to think that my dad had him as a teacher and I did too lol.  I came home and watched the Wedding Planner for awhile, I love that movie!  Went online for a bit and now I am planning on going to sleep soon. Yay I dont have to get up in the morning!"

We get into these queer moods and annoy the crap out of anyone who is around us...good thing we were alone this time.  Anyways we hung out and we went to Angelos Pizza with my mom.  The next day we had to get up at the crack of dawn and go to cheering practice.  That went good. I went to the libary and got new books to read since I havent read a thing since school got out. Bad me.  I got this really good book and read it all yesterday, I finally finished it at like 2 in the morning.  I do that often if I get a really good book, I cant put it down. Christopher Pike is like the best author ever. Our whole road lost power for a bit because of that HUGE thunderstorm...but when the power cam back on...the phones didnt so I couldnt go online all last night and justa bout died.  The phones finally come back on this morning. Then today I had to go over to Erikas at 7:30 to watch her...I went back to sleep as soon as I walked through the door,  we didnt get up until 11 today and I had some funky dreams lol.  I had to leave early to go to gymnastics so Big Erika came to watch Little Erika for me.  Gymnastics went good too.  I feel like I am doing alot better on my backhandspring...hopefully will have that soon all by myself...god I sound like a little kid...ALL BY MYSELF.  Anyways I have to watch Erika again tomorrow...should be fun...maybe?"

Tomorrow I have to watch Erika until gymnastics at 1:30, then after gymnastics Cecilee is sleeping over and then we have cheering in the morning.

I had the most stupid dream ever that it was my dance recital and everyone was screwing up really bad, Jessica fell flat on her face, Nicole kept coming in on the wrong parts, people were just standing there like weirdos and I got stuck in the curtain and couldnt do anything.  Why am I dreaming about dance recital when that was in May?!? Lol weird."

Then I watched Dirty Dancing for the kajillionth time...but thats okay cuz it is just about the best movie ever.  Then I went outside for a bit to practice jumps and crap for cheering...then I decided that I needed to go and run...but I didnt want to run on the road that my mom and I usually walk on because she was not home and I didnt dare to go alone. Just my luck someone would kidnap me.  So I ran 10 laps around my house and pool and stuff. It sucked..but oh well gotta do it right?"

I had to sleep in her brother's room.  Her brother is in a training corse thing for the army...so he doesnt live with them, but he recently visited them...with his girlfriend, so I was kinda freaked out to sleep in that bed man.  I didnt move around that much lol.  Anyways we told each other that the first one to wake up had to wake up the other one who was still sleeping.  So this morning I woke up to a cell phone right near my face...ringing and ringing over and over again.  What a weirdo.  So we hung out for the day and went swimming at her aunt's house. Then I got home, ate a BLT, and didnt do alot.  I have cheering tomorrow at 7 in the morning, its gunna suck getting up. I am kinda in a bad mood right now...for no reason, just feel like it, people make me mad really easy."

Then I went online for a bit, watched TV etc.  Then Glenny called to say that he was heading over to my house.  I didnt mind at all...to bad i was still in my PJ's...oh well.  So we hung out for a bit and watched Pirates of the Caribbean...since he has NEVER SEEN THAT MOVIE.  I couldnt believe that!

My mom has had to watch her for the past week and a half just for like a half hour in the morning, then she brings her to day camp for the day, so we dont have to watch her! haha.  Then I woke back up at like 8 in a panick because my FIRE ALARM was going off!  This must have been the funniest sight in the world...here I am half asleep trying to figure out why a alarm would be going off..finally when I realized it was a fire alarm I started to panick, and I looked all over for some huge flame of fire...and nothing...I think the battery was low so thats why it did that.  So then I woke up AGAIN to my mom telling me to go sleep in her room cuz the cable guy was here and she didnt really want me snoring away while hes working on the TV in my room...which was probley a good idea.  I had gymnastics today, so my mom brought Cenzie, Cec and I to that...only to find Britny and Brandy waiting outside cuz the instructor did show up yet.  We waited...and waited...and no one showed up after 20 minutes so we left. We went to Walmart then we dropped off Cecilee at Brett's house/shop thinger, and then Cenzie and I went and got icecream, Cenzie pointed out something...isnt it weird how we get icecream...on a cone..and lick it off with out tongues?!?  That is so weird to me.  Anyways...we headed back home and my mom's car decided to be weird and start stalling and stuff..i found it hilarious..but apparently she didnt.  Then I decided to watch specials on TV about Sharks...I like sharks now...they are freaky but kinda cool.

We went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory finally!  It seriously is like the best movie in the world.  I loved it.  I liked it more than the original movie.  Johnny Depp is seriously the best actor on the planet, no questions asked.  Not only is he hott, but he can like transform into anything for a movie.  Its so cool.  Jaclyn and I made sure that we bought a bunch of junk to eat at the movies.  After the movie we went back to my house and hung out, we watched the Sponge-Bob movie until we fell asleep.  We had to bring Jaclyn home before 11 cuz her daddy was picking her up to go to his house in Portland.  So now I am eating pancakes.  I dont know what I want to do today..."

So Cecilee, Glenny, Brett, AJ and I all went back to her house and watched movies all night, even though we had to get up early the next morning to go to AJ's dog show thinger.  So we got up extra early and got ready for that.  AJ got a new little American Bulldog puppy and they entered him in this contest and he got 1st place, he was so adorable.  I am soo hot right now, I wish our pool was cleaned so I could go swim, but you know, tough luck for me."

The days seemed sooooo long there, cuz we were up at like 6 getting ready and practicing and going to classes until 9 at night.  But the food, omg the food was so good there LoL.  It was good to get to know the other people on the squad, had some fun times.  We got a spirit stick every night, so we all were really happy about that.  Cecilee, Cocoa, Britny, Brandy and Jody made All American, so I was very proud of them for doing that.  I am glad to be home though.  CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY TONIGHT!!!

"event","Today I got to sleep...yessssssssss. I love sleeping, so I got up around noon and watched TV while eating breakfast.  Mom called me and said she was going to pick me up at 2:00 to go to Pittsfield with her because she had a doctors appointment.  So I sat in the car while she went into the doctors office..I apparently do not know how to work a freakin air conditioner because I THOUGHT it was on..but I guess not since I was sitting there sweating to death.  She came out about a zillion hours later..after I died of heat stroke.  We went to Subway and the Pool Place since our pool was kinda icky looking.  Then on our way back home I saw the most nasty thing ever.  Seriously, I have never seen anything more gross and sad.  A poor little cat got run over, and it was still moving.  It was so sad.  I almost cried.  This is why we dont let our cats out of our house, because people who cant drive, run over little kittys.  Anyways, I went back home and hung out and watched National Treasure with my dad.  Thats a cool movie.  Tomorrow I have cheering."

"event","Im not in the greatest mood right now. I dont know why, I feel like being in a bad mood so I am going to be.  I went to Cecilee's house on Saturday even though she was not home, she was getting back from the fireworks with Brett I guess and got home late.  I ate with her family and watched apart of a baseball game with them, her step-dad makes me laugh.  Anyways I went in her room and watched the movie Cry-Baby on TV.  It was all quiet and I heard a huge bang and Cecilee's laugh, she fell in the hallway while coming in her room...nice one.  So anyways we went to the races on Sunday, A.J. did awesome as always.  We went back to her house and slept.  Today we got up and went to her Auntie's house cuz it is Glenny's birthday on tuesday.  So we went and hung out there for awhile, it was really fun.  Her step-dad took Glenny, Cecilee and I to the movies, and we saw War of the Worlds, it was pretty good.  We then met up with some more of her family at the fireworks in Skowhegan.  The fireworks were gay and lasted for about 2 seconds, but it was still cool just hanging out.  Tomorrow I have no plans what so ever. I think I want to just hang out at home and not do anything inparticular."

"event","Today Jakiebaby, Savanna, My mom and I went to the Bangor Mall.  I love the mall.  We picked up Jakiechan and went to the store so I could get something to eat.  God and this guy, who we have no clue who he is just kept talking to us.  He was like old and gross and just nasty man.  I hate when old guys just decide to be ""extra friendly"" and decide to talk with you, so assume that Jaclyn and I were pretty freaked out.  We went to the Car Sales so Jaclyn could get money from her mommy.  We then went to go pick up Vanna.  I havent hung with Jaclyn or Vanna for a long time so this was pretty fun.  We were so hyped up in the car on the way to the mall.  I was singing to all the songs and driving Jaclyn up the wall.  It was pretty funny because we got talking about Micheal Jackson, and Jaclyn was trying to act like him so she was all like...""Ow..Bobby Jo...Hee-Hee"" and I was like uhhh Jaclyn dont you mean Billie Jean, and she was like oh whatever, funny stuff.  We got to the mall and shopped a bit.  I had to pick up something for a special someone before anything because I know myself, I would spend all my money and forget to get his gift.  We ate at the Chinese Place in the mall and I got to use chopsticks, lol it didnt go too well.  When we were in the mall these old men literally turned around to stare, I hate that.  Okay, I went to the mall and I was planning on buying tank-tops, a new belly ring, that gift I had to make sure to get, and if I had money laft over maybe another bathing suit.  I ended up getting some capris and that gift.  God I never get what I say Im going to get.  We made sure to get icecream before leaving the mall.  The ride home was even more interesting and funny.  I love Jakiebaby and Savanna so much.  We went back to my house for a bit but then had to take Jakiechan home.  And Vanna got picked up.  I picked up my room a bit and Im planning on taking a nap.  I dont feel the greatest.  Im not sure if I am going to Cecilee's tonight or not, I hope she calls to let me know, cuz I am supposed to got to the races tomorrow with them."

"event","I watched Erika today again, but this time it wasnt so bad since she slept until 11:30.  Yay that kid likes to sleep just like me.  But eventually I got up because random people kept coming in the house.  I watched Saved By the Bell, man I love that show.  We made Pizza for lunch and watched the movie Sleepover.  By the end of that, Derek came home, so I left.  I got home and screwed around for a bit.  Glenny and Cecilee picked me up and we went and got Chad.  We all went to Taco Bell and the Movies.  We were going to go to the one in SkowTown but we didnt feel like waiting in a line that was 7584752 years long.  So we went to Waterville instead and saw Bewicthed.  That was such a cute movie, it was funny too.  We then went to McDonalds and then they dropped me off.  I had alot of fun.  Tomorrow I think Im going to the mall.  Okay I think Savanna is coming, which will be cool since we havent hung out in since like forever, but I was supposed to call her when I got back from the movies...but I didnt realize it would be this late.  I will call in the morning.  Jakiechan was supposed to come, but then she said she couldnt, but then my mom said she called while I was gone and she asked what time to be at my house in the morning, so I am assuming that she is going now.  I went online hoping she would be on but I guess not.  I also will call her tomorrow morning.  Man Jakiebabe, I hope your going, and MAKE UP YOUR MIND Lol.  I have a major headache now.  I need to go and sleep."

But as I stumbled by way down the hall to the bathroom I realized my mom was on a mad cleaning spree.  It was bad.  I could smell cleaner all the way through the house.  So I got ready and had some extra time so I watched Charlie and The Chocolate Factory on TV.  Cecilee and her mommy came and picked me up and we went to the highschool for practice.  Practice was fun..it made me tired, but it was fun.  So when I got home from that I took a longgggg nap, and it felt good too Lol.  My mom continued on her mad cleaning spree, which is pointless because she will have to do it again tomorrow lol.  I watched Catwoman for a while and then decided to come online for a bit.  Tomorrow I have to watch Erika and Brittany again, but then next week I have the whole week off so I dont mind. Okay my mom put a fan on and left the room. She aimed the fan right on me so I am like freezing now.  Im gunna go kick her butt."

"event","Today I had to watch Erika once again.  My life is so interesting.  We slept until 10:30.  I had no dreams.  I woke up to their cat laying on top of my chest, with her face right up to my face.  Their cat has a problem with drooling, when it gets very friendly it starts to drool.  So this cat was also drooling on my chest.  It was not a pleasent sight to wake up to.  We watched the Price is Right...again.  We decided to make pancakes, so we did that.  Erika and I then decided to switch up our schedule and play with play-doe.  Then she drew a picture of me.  It was a interesting result.  Then Derek came home for lunch and asked me to make a toasted cheese sandwich for him..because ""he didnt know how."" Ya right, he was just too lazy, so I decided to be nice and make him lunch.  He went back to work and left me alone with Erika.  She drew and painted some more and it wasnt long before Derek came back for good.  I went home as soon as I got the chance. I lazed around all day doing nothing since I was home alone and had nothing else to do.  I then ahd the bright idea to go wax my eyebrows.  I heated up the wax too much and it was all...nasty and too hott.  I wasnt picky so I swipped on some of that, unknowingly dropping a huge glob on my eyelashes.  So I spent the seriously about a hour trying to get that out.  I finally did.  It sucked bad, I think I will heat the wax up right for now on.  I got ready and mom and I went to Skowhegan.  We just got back, I found a note from Cecilee stuck on my door.  She is funny. I am bored out of my mind.  My life is not interesting..its quite boring at the moment.  Tomorrow I have a cheering meeting.  That should give me something to do other than watch little kids.  I am really bored man.  I think Im going to go clean something.  iT will give me something to do for awhile."

"event","This weekend was really fun.  Cecilee came over and we went swimming and layed out in the sun for a lil bit.  Glenny came and picked us up and we went back to Cec's and watched The Seed Of Chuckie.  I have never seen a Chuckie movie before, until this one, and it was pretty funny.  We all went to the races on Sunday.  A.J. is so damn cute on his dirtbike.  It was soooo hot on Sunday, but it was still fun.  After the races we all went back to my house and went swimming.  My mom and I dropped them back off at home and I went home and watched Pirates of the Caribbean.  I seriously like that movie the more i watch it.  I had to watch Erika on Monday..we did our ritual..Got up, ate, watched the Price is Right, swam, and jumped on the trampoline.  Seriously we do the same freakin thing everyday.  But today..we switched it up a little, Brittany came over. So I basically layed around and chilled out while they played outside.  Derek came home super early today which was good.  I think he gets the drift that Im sick of watching them because when he comes home from work, Im interviewing him on what time he is going to be home.  He walks through the door and Im all up in his face like..""SO ARE U HOME FOR GOOD OR DO U HAVE TO GO BACK? WHEN ARE U GOING TO BE BACK...DONT LEAVE ME WITH THEMMMMMM....""  I think he gets annoyed by that..but o well..he knows how it is to be trapped with children all day.  I love those two kids, but man sometimes it just gets to be toooo much."

It wasnt bad today because with Brittany there to play with Erika, I didnt have to keep her entertained every 3473891 seconds.  They basically played outside on the trampoline and swam in their little pool all day.  I just had to occasionally feed them Lol.  But then they decided they needed to go to my house to swim in my pool.  But I think Brittany was intiminated my it because she didnt swim much.  But thats okay.  So we went back to her house and I layed out in the sun because I am sooo pale.  Derek came home so I left because the Kiddies were starting to fight. I think they have too much in common so thats why they fight.  O well.  I came home and slept, I was so tired from the night before because it was my big idea to stay up late and watch the Notebook, when I knew I had to get up early. While I was sleeping my dad thought it would be a good idea to come into my room and ask me if I knew anything about the movie Madagascar, I was half asleep and I was trying to tell him about it..but I know I must have sounded retarded because I could hear myself just mummbling a bunch of words. My parents and I watched that movie The Pacifier.  It was pretty funny.  I think tomorrow Cecilee and I are planning to hang out.  Im going to her little brother's race this weekend.  He looks so cute riding on the little dirtbikes Lol."

"event","Today..once again I had to walk arcoss the street at the crack of dawn to watch Erika.  It wasnt that bad I guess.  I went back to sleep once I got over there.  We decided to be lazy today.  Erika and I got up and ate breakfast, then we watch the Price is Right and played cards.  Erika tried to explain to me how to play the game 31.  She left out alot of parts, so when I thought I won..she was like ""oh no u didnt i forgot to tell you..."" So I decided we needed to play a game I knew.  So we played Go Fish..simple enough huh?  We watched Uptown Girls too.  I love Dakota Fanning.  She is so cute.  We went to my house to go swimming.  I tried to lay out in the sun to get a tan but Erika gets so bored easy its kinda hard.  My mom took Erika and I to Skowhegan after that.  We went to Walmart and went to Pizza Hut.  I love Pizza man.  On the way home..I almost died again thanks to my mothers great driving.  But thats nothing new.  We dropped Erika back home and by that time I had to go to gymnastics.  I dont really like going to gymnastics at night.  But o well I will get over it, it was fun anyways.  Glenny went with us. Woo-hoo he gets to watch me fall on my face.  After we went for icecream, even though I was still STUFFED from Pizza Hut.  Cecilee seems to believe that I dislike eating around Glenny. I really could care less, I dont eat when Im not hungry.  Anyways, we saw Cenzie there.  Her hair looks so good man.  We dropped Cecilee and Glenny off at home. Then Mom and I rented the Notebook.  I love that movie, it makes me cry, so I think I will watch that later on when everyone is sleeping..so I dont make a total fool of myself while Im crying hysterically.  I have to watch Erika tomorrow,  I will be up all night, then I have to get up to watch her..how great."

"event","Today when I got up..Cecilee was sitting watching the movie Enough very quietly. She also tried to pinch my nose with her monkey feet.  (thats our new thing, pinching each other with our feet) We decided to get up and shower.  We went for a bike ride around Shady Lane and my butt reallllly hurts from the seats on those bikes man.  I seriously need to work on my ability to ride a bike or basically do anything physical, Lol.  But anyways, we got back and ate kiwi, Cecilee kept telling me to eat the white, middle part first, but I told her to keep her odd eating habbits to herself, Lol.  We watch Cujo too.  I cannot believe that Cecilee has never seen that movie before.  Anyways, Glenny called and told Cecilee to get her butt home.  So we went to go drop off Cecilee but I ended up staying at her house so we could go to the movies later.  Cecilee's parental unit brought Glenny, A.J., Cec and I to the movies.  We all went to go see Herbie fully loaded. That movie was better than I thought it was gunna be, it was kinda cute.  There were these two older ladies sitting in the back of us.  Cecilee was like..Hey des thats us in 50 years, that girl makes me laugh.  Anyways they dropped me back off at home.  And here I am online.  PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THAT CHAT ROOM..THAT WAS SOO FUNNY MAN.  And I still cannot believe Jaclyn's sister is dating Julain..man that is sooo wrong.  I think I need to go to sleep soon since I have to get up at the crack of dawn to watch Erika tomorrow."

"event","Yesterday after extreme boredom..I went to Cecilee's house.  WE MADE COOKIES.  CEC AND I MAKE SOME MEAN NO-BAKE COOKIES MAN. Her step dad Adrian and his friend were trying to get online in her room, to do that you had to put a cord under the house.  Cecilee and I were sitting in her room watching them TRY to accomplish this task.  Adrian's friend was under the house..when suddenly we hear this BANG, followed by an OOOOWWCHHHH. It was soooo funny. Then later that night Cecilee, Glenny and I watched the Hellraiser movies. They were pretty nasty, but kinda interesting at the same time.  Cecilee found out that she can make her ear a squeeky toy.  She was laying on my arm and got up and found that her ear makes weird noises.  That just about entertained her for the whole night.  She was in one of her ""queer moods"" as Glenny would say.  Before we went to sleep, she decided she needed to rhyme everyones name with banana.  She named basically everyone she knew.  It was interesting...then I remember she was talking to herself saying she wasnt tired at all..then two seconds later...she was asleep.  I had to get up this morning to get dance pictures retaken in Pittsfield.  So I went and did that.  Then I went BACK over to Cec's house and we watched her adorable little brother Connor.  We went to gymnastics only to find that the instructor didnt show up.  So Cecilee and I went to my house to go swimming.  And here we are now..so gunna go hang out."

But I got to her house as Derek was leaving for work. Then I collapsed in the chair and fell asleep again.  I always have the dumbest dreams whenever I am at Derek and Erika's house.  This time I had a dream that some kid with a red afro came to their house while I was watching Erika..and some how Cecilee ended up there too..I dont know, dont ask.  But anyways the phone rang and woke me up..I guess it woke up Erika too because she stormed out of her room and raced me to the phone..weirdo.  Then we watched Shrek 2 while eating breakfast.  We then decided to go outside and swim..so we walked BACK to my house and got my bathing suit and then walked BACK to her house to swim.  We swam and then jumped on the trampoline for a bit.  Then we ate lunch.  Erika then decided she NEEDED to go online to play some game on disneychannel.com so I let her do that.  That pretty much entertained her for awhile.  Derek came home early from work and we watched Bugs Bunny cartoons for awhile..it was kinda hard to hear the TV because Erika thought she NEEDED to talk to herself. More like SCREAM to herself, i dont know about that kid sometimes lol.  I came back home and took a shower, and talked to <3 JACLYN <3 for a bit.  I have no clue what I am doing for the rest of the day.  I am really bored right now so I think I will call Cecilee to see if she went to the races this weekend or if she ended up staying home.  That will entertain me for awhile. Then I will be back to boredom."

But then I decided I was FREEZING, I i went on a mad search for blankets and found none. But I did find sleeping bags, so Nikki and I were covered with a huge pile of sleeping bags while sleeping last night.  Then I woke up at 5 in the morning to a annoying bird screeching near my bedroom window, I almost died.  So I plugged my ears and fell back asleep only to wake up AGAIN at 11 with ANOTHER FREAKIN BIRD screeching near my window, so I just got up.  I guess this bird problem didnt bother Nicole any because she seemed to sleep right through it. Then I ate pancakes.  They were kinda gross but I still ate them. Then I talked to Jaclyn <3 online for a bit. Then earlier today, Nicole and I decided we were going to be geeks and ride our bikes on this 4 mile trail thing.  But as we were getting out the bikes, Nicole suddenly fell to the ground. I dont know her ankle has been bothering her lately. So that was the end of the big idea to ride bikes.  Then we went inside and ate icecream and Nikki's mommy picked her up. I think later my mom and I are going into Waterville..I have no clue why, but I think thats what she told me.  I HATE when my parents come into my bedroom while I am sleeping, and then they decide to tell me they are leaving to work and then tell me a long story about things we are going to do today.

It was kinda fun. Cenzie, Britney, Brandy and I ran the concesion stand and it was really weird to think that last year that was like THE THING to do on Fridays.  But ya anyways..these two kids kept coming up..and i think they liked the twins. lol and one of them kept his money in his hat..cuz he had no pockets and i was like ""oh yea i keep my money in my bra when i have no pockets."" and Mechanzie started cracking up man. It was the best. And I finally met that Bobby kid Jaclyn knows. I thought he was 5, the way jaclyn described him, but i guess not.  Oh and before the dance..Josh Tanner was doing the moon walk. It was kinda creepy, i think he practices at home.  So Coach ended the dance early cuz there were 4 FIGHTS AT THE DANCE... so after we cleaned up..and Sasha's little sister was scrapping the gum off the floor and she went to go put it in the trash can and it bounced off the trash can...and landed on Becka's chest. Man, that was the funniest thing in the world right there. So after the dance Carolyn, Cecilee and Glenny dropped me off at home.  Then I slept.  So today I woke up and vaccumed the floors while dancing around to The Bee-Gees lol..you have to watch out for me while im home alone..it can get pretty weird.  So I called Nikki since we havent hung out for like EVER. And we decided we were gunna hang out later.  So my mom and I went to town to get my dad a father's day present..we got him some machine thinger to use for the car, i really have no clue what it does but o well.. he willlike it.  So we went and picked up Nikki and then we came back here to make my Live Journal. Yay!  We laughed so hard over the queerest things..like I spelt Up with two p's and we were on the floor laughing...it was pretty weird but o well.

"event","She should have been asleep hours ago, tests and rehearsals and responsibility all looming deadly over the next day. Not that it stops her.


She's convinced that stories are like a drug. Addictive and habit-forming, terrible rainbows that make your head spin and forget about homework or to-do lists or people who ask too many questions. They warp time, too, and when the text scrolls by the hours go too fast.

It's addiction, because it wraps itself around her brain until she forgets about the living breathing people who roll their eyes when she talks about it. Because Middle-Earth doesn't exist, Julian Bashir won't ever be real enough to sit on a couch with and discuss James Bond, and JKR seems to be going off her rocker.

As if anyone's on their rocker anymore.

They are her real friends, the ones who don't really exist in a way other people understand. More than friends, they are <I>her</i>, and she is just a mashed up version of all of them walking around and being confused. They are perfect, because they aren't real and no one else can touch them. They are tragic and beautiful and she cries when she thinks they're real.

She doesn't know how other people survive without them."

There are flowers on his walls, and the lavalamp on his desk gives a pale glow. He fiddles with the DVD player, searches through stacks of DVDs till he finds the right one.

She marvels at how comfortable she is around him.

He's strangely neutral, and she's utterly unattracted to him, which makes it easy. She wonders if it's the rumors that calm her (he kissed a boy, they say, at the dance last summer). It is, and she knows it, but she wonders if it matters to her whether they're true.

<font size=1>Aragorn walked along with the column, his hand resting lightly on Hasufel's withers. He tried to ignore the slight tension in the air between himself and the Shieldmaiden who walked beside him (and was, in fact, doing a rather good job of it, not having acknowledged her existence for at least a furlong or two).

""Where is she?""

Eowyn's voice cut through the trudging mindlessness of Aragorn's thoughts, and he turned to her with a look of mild bewilderment.

The Shieldmaiden, for her part, noted that Lord Aragorn looked mighty fine when flummoxed - but moved on to the rest of her question. Which she was a bit nervous about, really. I mean, did she really want to know? What if he was married? What if he was insulted? What if it was a family heirloom? By 87 he was probably a great-grandfather...Eowyn cut herself off and finished.

""The woman who gave you that jewel.""

Aragorn looked blank for a moment, then looked down to the intricate pendant hanging from his neck.

""This?""

Eowyn suppressed a blush at the incredulous tone in his voice. She nodded.

""It was a birthday present from Legolas. When I turned eighty.""

It was Eowyn's turn to be flummoxed. Legolas (he of impeccable hair and nancing step), at the sound of his name, turned and locked eyes briefly with Aragorn. Eowyn looked between the two for a moment, then nearly stopped in her tracks in shock. 

""Oh.""


So much for her chances.</font></lj-cut>"

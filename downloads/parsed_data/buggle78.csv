"event","This is probably my third livejournal account. I decided to sign up again mostly to help me in the wedding planning process. Nick and I decided to get married in early May and our wedding day is fast approaching.....June 30th....just 2 weeks from now! Needless to say, it's been a whirlwind and I've spent nearly every free second reading the wedding communities, trying to figure out what I need to do!"

"event","been really wierd year.... to say the least....very tuff struggle living in america under the antichrists reign.......but hey my head is above water at least ...... but anyhoo.....someone is trying to link self harm to tattooing and while ive not anything against that and feel it will help herself and other selfharmers..i think that mainstreamers will manipulate her well meaning work against modded women..... i mentioned this and OMG youd thought id asked em to chop their heads off......and since then ive got a person stating that im ""self rightous"" because of this..... whatever! you dont know me at all and yes it was my choice to be modded and i stand by my choice.... we (modded older women) have double the struggle in society than vanilla older women.... and yes we know this and stand by our choices...at least i do.....this is america and everyone should have freedom to do what they will to their bodies (ya im pro choice!) and SELF RIGHTOUS (sheeesh talk about self rightous - lookie in the mirror honey!) mainstreamers need to open their eyes and try accept this ...just as they accepted blacks, women, jews, gays etc.... same thing peeps!  

and just being a middle aged woman its hard to find a good job...always over qualified and saggy boobies and all lol.....you just dont get hired...over say a fresh faced perky boobied girlie girl...they can pay her lower wages and gaze upon the perkiness..........btw>>>>all my mods are hidden when im at work and/or on an interview...i look very conserative ...if you seen me at work you wouldnt even know i was modded!

when i get my mods i always think of how im going to cover them...hence no arm or face coverage (DUH) and i have so far done this successfully..... gawd and so many reasons i mod my body>>>all my mods are a celebration of life journeys and my spirituality ...connecting with my innerself my soul and beauty... ya i dont care for my body without my mods...gotta admit its changed...menopause is a wonderful thing (NOT) went from a size 4 to a 14....110lbs to 155lbs.... and yes tattooing helps me accept these changes....and where did those coloful wrinkles come from!?!?! but hey they are very pretty.....  and damn why is that hair growing there??!!?? snickers......since menopause my mind tisnt what it was...i am very forgetful and get confused more.....ive lesions all over my brain but i dont have migrains....i suffer from sensory neuropathy also but i am not diabetic...all this came on after menopause started... and yes tattooing also helps me over come the constant pain i live in 24/7...many reasons people mod their bodies not just because of self harm... 

myself it all started about 5 yrs old staring at the women with the pretty gold and silver hoops in their ears....i remember sitting on their laps flicking at the pretty hoops.....and my great gramps collection of the national geographic mags that had the tribal women with tattoos/scarring/stretched piercings... all that fascinated me since i was 5.... and all this was well before my parents divorced (think i was ummm 12 maybe?).....and at 9 yrs old my mother took me to the doc to get those pretty earrings!  gawd i was so thrilled! that was just the beginning of my journey...to put my inner beauty on the outside.... beautiful shiney jewelry, beautiful art of color carressing my skin,  of dark and light upon me.... ya it rocks!

tis like this..... if you knew me you would know that i am a loving kind generous person who loves everyone....   i am an anciety soul and belief in reincarnation...... yeppers you got it im not christain AT ALL.....and im proud of where im at in life...(call it self rightous if you want babydoll)... i married at 16, divorced by 18, raised two kids ON MY OWN SUCCESSFULLY without any aid from govt or their father, worked 3 jobs, struggled long hours to complete my education, i feel that i am intellegent, peeps say im heavily modded but dont feel that way, i remarried 5 years ago.... happily at that, high middle class income until 3 yrs ago..... yes life has changed but hey ima rolling with it...yay!

whoa i am way excited i may be suspending in a couple months...so wanted to do this for many years , it has been a life goal for many years since the movie sundance (think that is it...freaking menopause) and it may be coming true soon!!! okay outtie for now huggles to all"

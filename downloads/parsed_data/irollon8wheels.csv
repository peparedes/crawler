probally take it. England was just awsome, it was so full of
culture and everyone was just awsome you know there were some that seemed
like jerks but it was over-all awsome and I want to go back so bad.

Yea and then my mom took me to Target and I finally got Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and I got a pair of jeans and then we went to Lifeway and I got two cds; Solid State Records Volume 2 and 3 and they're awsome.

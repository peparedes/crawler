"event","It's official - I hate moving. Not that moving myself is much better, because it isn't. Moving anyone, really. It just happened to be me this weekend and I have to deal with the aftermath. It took me 45 minutes last night to root around various boxes in my garage to find my alarm clocks and morning routine junk (shower gel, shampoo, contact solution, towel). Saturday the convoy moved pretty much everything into my garage, and then Dad and I spent Sunday moving all of the heavy things from the garage into my house. Sunday was worse than Saturday for the simple reason that it was just the two of us, and I have a lot of heavy shit. 

That being said - now that my living room is set up, the studio is *almost* back together, and my bedroom is together and the dressers are filled... It feels like home again. Well, kind of. I have to still take the little rats back to my place. I can take Stormy anytime since she's in the aquarium, but I can't take Kitty because I have to clean the cage before I load it in the car. That's probably going to have to wait until tomorrow at the earliest (they have enough food and water for a few days right now). The place feels really empty without them around, and the more I think about it, the more I don't think I can have them downstairs. They would be too far away from whatever I'd do in the house to justify that. I really don't know where to put them. Eventually I'll be spending a lot of time in the basement, but since I don't have any weight benches or workout equipment, and no projector for the Home Theater of Doom, there's not much down there but a perfect arena for floor hockey.

The real killer is that my kitchen is filled with boxes, and these boxes are filled with all of my kitchen utensils, pots, pans, and spices. I can't cook. I ate hot dogs last night because it was the only thing I could really think to buy that was quick, easy, tasty, and didn't require the use of anything really kitchen related. I have more hot dogs for tonight, but I'm not looking forward to it. Another thing I'm not looking forward to - mowing my damn lawn tonight. There's 45 minutes of effort that would be better spent unpacking something or just sitting on my ass.

I do have to say, my house is GANGSTA. It doesn't have a giant Christmas tree yet, but when/if I get one, it will officially be ""GANGSTA."""

"event","I remember everyone saying ""As soon as you get a house you're going to find zillions of projects and stuff you want to change."" I also remember scoffing at said everyone since the house was in incredible shape, with a new roof, fresh paint, and working appliances. 

What can I say? Everyone's right.

Aside from the routine maintenance, such as lawn mowing, leaf raking, and hedge trimming (which I don't have to worry about because I don't have any hedges), there are about 7 different things I already know that I want to do to the house. Some are pretty simple, such as raising the low hanging chandelier in my formal dining room. The formal dining room is going to become my library since I don't have a formal dining room table and I don't see myself really getting one any time soon. Most people I know with formal dining rooms have used them twice, ever. I want to make use of all of my space. I don't want any disused rooms. I'm picturing dark wood and a couple of those red chesterfield chairs with rivets in em. Perfect for relaxing after a long hard day of whatever the hell I did all day. Anyway, another thing I want to do which will cost money is replace all the interior doors in my place with solid core 6 panel oak doors. Not only will that look far nicer than the flat hollow core oak doors that are in the place now, but in the event of a roommate, I'd like there to be as much sound dampening available as possible. Heavier doors seem to be a relatively inexpensive way to do that. Of course once the door-doors are switched out, then I have to put in new bifold doors to match the interior doors. Great. All my damn closets, of which there are... Five. Shit. Then, downstairs, in the unfinished part of the basement, I want to put in a fourth bathroom. I'd also like to run CAT6 cabling through all of my walls, but I don't think that would be very easy. I'll probably just buy a few wireless N cards and call it a day. Then in the garage, there's a pull down ladder which goes right through the firewall - giant hazard. I have to get rid of that thing and put more fire retardant material in the hole. I also have to get that damn Rainbow Play System out of my backyard. I think I'll just Craigslist that bastard and let whoever buys it deal with getting it out. I want to buy a battery back up for my sump-pump. 

Most everything (save for selling that play system) is going to cost me money. I had no idea that it would rack up so fast. Granted, everything except plugging that fire hazard can be left for later. I had grandiose plans for my tax return this year, such as spending it on hookers and blow, but I believe prostitutes and cocaine will have to wait until later. I keep meaning to post additional pictures of my house (ok, ANY) but I think I'll wait to document everything once I have furniture down. 

The ""furniture"" move starts Saturday at 7:30 AM. Good god almighty I'm not prepared for that. Tomorrow I took the day off and it's all about disassembling my studio and getting that ready to move. I'd be up for taking all of it over to my house tomorrow also, but it's supposed to keep raining. I don't want any of it to get wet, since it's all pretty much sensitive electronic equipment. Moisture + electronics = broken crap. I'm going to feel really really naked until I have internet at the house though. Re-running my studio cabling isn't my idea of a good time either. 

Work is sucking. I'm not too optimistic about the current state of my project, but there's nothing I can do about it. It's all forces outside my control mucking everything up. Since I've got way too much stress already worrying about the house and moving and state of the state, I don't have any concern left over for these things out of my control. I have a feeling it's making my boss and coworkers think I don't care or am a lazy bastard, which isn't the case. It's just that I can only give a shit about things I can do something about. If group A won't approve my security clearance, well, I've asked them. I asked them twice. It's in their hands now. I'll be over here watching what little savings I have run down the house drain."

"event","Two females now run my life, and I keep both of them in cages. 

Last Sunday I got Stormy - she's even cuter in person. I've taken a bunch of pictures, but since I don't have a flickr account or something like that, I can't post any of them yet. Couple that with the fact that I don't even have enough time in the day to download the pics off of my camera, well, you get the picture. I forgot how small Kitty was when she was younger. I have a few pictures from 2001 of her sitting on a radiator grate, but that doesn't really give too much perspective. Comparing Kitty to Stormy, man, it's so noticeable. Kitty's a handful and weighs about a pound. Stormy probably weighs about 6 ounces and is the size of a largish hamster. Maybe a little bit bigger than a big hamster? 

The biggest difference between the two is Stormy doesn't mind being picked up at all. She's a fearless little girl. I am thinking of changing her name to ""Squirmy"" though, because that's what she does as soon as you pick her up. ""Thanks for taking me out of the cage, now lemme run around."" Stormy also loves almonds. 

Next Weds I close on the house and it's really starting to freak me out. In a good way. Yes, I'll have a giant house payment, but I'll also have a giant house. I'll have a deck I can practice my spit-takes off of, a lawn I can neglect, and rooms I may never enter. I've decided to turn one of my bedrooms into a library, and one of the other bedrooms will be my studio. That leaves my master bedroom where I'll sleep, and the other bedroom will either be the spare for guests, or wherever a potential roommate will live. 

I've decided I finally need a new guitar amp. Seeing as how the one I have doesn't work any more and I don't feel like getting it repaired... Of course I need to repair my guitar first. It's a 50th anniversary Fender Stratocaster that I modified the fuck out of. It has hand-rewound pickups (I spent weeks when I was in 10th grade rewinding the goddamn things with the thinnest copper wire I could get my hands on) a toggle switch that links all three pickups together to boost output, rewired the selector switch to link the neck and bridge pickups and a couple other wacky things, and a big red button that cuts off all sound to the output, effectively acting as a ""mute"" for the guitar as long as the button is pressed down. I have to open the damn rat's nest of wires and sort out where the solder is working its way out. Plus I have to remember what the hell I did in the first place and remember what I was thinking - that is going to be the biggest challenge. ""WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT?""

I'm looking at a Marshall tube combo - it's around $900, but the warmth of a tube is so incredible that if I'm going to get anything, it's going to be a tube. I'd get a half stack but that adds like $600 onto it and since I'm not really planning on doing much guitar gigging (ok, ANY guitar gigging) there's no point in getting show quality gear. I also couldn't turn a half stack up to 7 in my basement without blowing out my windows. I don't mind making a little noise in my new neighborhood, but setting off car alarms isn't the first impression I want to make. I'm also going to pick up a couple Sennheiser microphones designed to be placed in front of guitar cabs and working more ""real"" stuff into my mixes. I've been listening to a lot of guitar-inspired synth lines and I figure if they can approximate guitars with synthesizers, I can approximate synthesizers with guitars. I think that's how VHS or Beta makes a living so it's not like I'm breaking ground here, but it's new to me. I'm also going to dust off the soldering iron and try my hand at modding my distortion pedal - I have a couple ideas for automation that I think would sound extremely cool on a guitar (again, ideas that have been around in synths for ages, but not really in guitar) and it's not like I have anything better to do. Why not do some recreational electrical engineering?

Tony's wedding rehearsal is tonight, along with the Groom's dinner. I have to pre-bowl also tonight, since I have alternate plans on Friday night. Saturday is the wedding itself, and I believe Courtney's in town to visit his woman this weekend so I'll be hanging out with him on Sunday. One of these days I'll have nothing to do at night. Maybe."

"event","Evidently in Inver Grove Heights you can still smoke indoors. At least for 8 more days. October 1st the State of Minnesota forces all bars and restaurants (including bowling alleys) to go smoke free. As hypocritical as it is, I disagree with the policy but really like the results. I guess I've become used to everything being smoke free because I really couldn't stand the environment last night.

Tonight was Tony's bachelor funeral... Uh, I mean party. It consisted of dinner at Outback, a couple hours at the King of Diamonds strip club, and then finishing the night off at the clan's old stomping grounds, Wells Fargo Bowling Alley in Inver Grove. I didn't drink  much at all because my mom and dad are coming back over to the apartment to help pack everything for my house move. Tenille called Tony to see how many lap dances he had and to yell at him about it. I said we should all turn our phones off at the beginning of the night because I knew that would happen. I mean barring that, just let it go to voicemail. It's a goddamn bachelor party. I bowled like absolute shit, despite rolling a 550 series yesterday. 

Tony seems in denial of his wedding. Almost as if he believes it's happening to someone else. 10 lap dances should have taken care of the problem, but I think it just gave him more ammo to use in his morning shower sessions. Ryan, Tony's best man, just bought the woman he's been dating for four months a $3000 diamond engagement ring. Good luck, Ryan.

"event","I guess it's finally legal to come back on here. Not that there was anything really preventing me from writing in this, but I just felt like a) I had nothing to say and b) Some things I just couldn't write about. 

I realized it's a choice - you choose who you want to friend and whose journal you want to read, much the same that people choose you if they find you interesting, funny, tragic, etc. Like the old Married With Children legal issue - if you don't like what's on, change the channel. Nobody's forcing you to watch. Or read. If you happen to stumble across something that you don't like, unless you have someone with a gun to your head, it's not like you're sitting there with a gun to your head. 

The main thing I've been avoiding writing about is that about 5 months ago Kris and I called our relationship off. Four years is a very long time. The stupid thing about not writing about it was that I didn't want a certain ex-girlfriend to read about it. As if we've been in a competition for ""being happy"" since we broke up 5 years ago. I've never really wanted to go friends-only, since I think it's somehow cheating - to me this is like an open book. If I didn't want this to be read and shared, I would just write in a paper journal. But yeah, there it is. We're done. 

It's been really hard. I mean far more painful than I thought it was going to be, especially since I know it was the right thing to do. I guess I could've written pages upon pages of crazy ramblings, dissecting my mood swings and comparing every moment to some battle in a foreign land, but I could easily do that on MySpace. In fact, I think I'd have to insist I do it on MySpace, as well as take a crapload of Ambien and make ""cry for help"" attempts at suicide. 

The biggest problem I have been having is trying to remain rational. Now it's been a while. 5 months. Nearly half a year. It still, to me, feels like yesterday. Maybe because we didn't have a dish tossing fight, and my frozen broccoli remained in my freezer, along with my supply of nutmeg. It shouldn't be as hard as it is for me to have to forcibly remind myself why we broke up - the last two years of our relationship was pretty horrible. I have a bad habit (maybe I'm not the only one) to idealize relationships after they've ended. It's self-torture is what it is. Could be that I have a little emotional masochistic streak in me, could be something else entirely. What I do know is I have to keep kicking myself with the reality that if we were still back together, we'd just be in the same place again. That's something neither one of us wants. I alternate between being just fine, deep regret, homicidal rage, sharp relief, and then being back to fine again. Cycling through these states of mind is really tiring. Like running a marathon bad. 

If I were to go to a counselor or a shrink to talk this out, I'm pretty sure they'd say I was in a pretty traumatic event and try to prescribe something for me. Or they'd say I have anger issues and need to get into a program or something, or I was depressed and have to attend sessions indefinitely. I mean I'm not going to stock up on guns and ammo at Gander Mountain and head on over to the Mall of America for skeet shooting, and I'm not going to off myself. The bad part is I'm kind of at a loss for how to cope. I don't really have anybody to talk to anymore - nobody that will sit around and let me talk in circles for hours about something like this. I had an issue with Shane about a month and a half ago and we had a kind of falling out during my trip to Tucson. Kate, being Shane's wife, is basically collateral damage from this. I've grown apart from Keith and Ken over the years, so I don't really feel like talking to them. Their answer would be just to get fucking wasted out of my gourd until I felt better. News flash fellas - I've tried that and its clinical effectiveness is paltry at best. Tony, with his marraige, has changed and isn't really the Tony I used to know anymore. Maybe that's working for him, but it feels like he's as lost as Kate is. 

About the only person I've been able to talk to is Ali, for which I'm grateful. The only thing is he's so busy running his own tech business that the days of hours spent chatting about everything are long since behind us. I'd talk to Kris, and I'm sure she'd listen, but I don't think it would be such a good idea. 

So there it is. It feels like I'm falling without a safety net. Maybe it's good that I'm going to have to work through this myself. I don't know. I'm pretty embarrassed that I'm still hurting so much after nearly a half year. Like, shit, grow a fucking pair, Nancy. Rub a little dirt on it and get back out there. Walk it off. Or the classic - oh just go get laid. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. Even if I was the type of guy who could just run out and do the one night stand thing, my self confidence has taken a giant hit. I blink and it's 4 years later. My metabolism slowed down about 3 years ago, and being in an accepting and loving relationship (one where you weren't made to feel like shit if you gained a couple pounds) I just slowly let myself go. I really didn't have the time or the energy, let alone the motivation, to go to the gym. Or at least that's what I think happened. It's hard to figure out where everything just kind of started heading downhill. You get trained by police procedural shows to think that you can remember what you said to a bartender two years ago on a Tuesday. Well, you can't. You can't even remember what you had for dinner three weeks ago. Least I can't. 

 So I've taken the obvious action and have started going back to the gym. I've been doing that for a couple of months and I've made some progress. The only thing is that it's going to take a long fucking time to repair 4 years of neglect. If I was never in great shape, if I never had an awesome body, if I never had the confidence that came with knowing I looked like I was carved out of marble, I wouldn't be nearly as fucking self-conscious as I am now. I tried posting an online personal ad a little while ago, but didn't get any responses. Congrats - way to kick a man when he's down, internets. I just feel sort of dirty and desperate, like I'm waving a sign that says ""PLEASE DATE ME."" What's worse is that I'm not sure I want to date anyone. I keep feeling like I need to get back in the game and move on, like until I do that I'm going to be stuck in my self-induced Wheel of Purgatory, which is the emotional version of the Tilt-A-Whirl, and just as likely to cause vomiting.

I met a girl that I developed a kind of crush on a while ago. Kris and I were still together, though at the tail end of our things. I met her at my friend Nat's going-away party. He was off to Oregon to work for Google. We spent most of the night talking together and had some good laughs. Obviously I didn't get to see her after that, being that she was a friend of a friend who went very far away. That, and it wasn't like I was going to ask for her number while I was still in a relationship. Well, Google didn't work out so well, so Nat came back last week and had a get together on Friday. This girl was there, and I tried my best to find some time to talk to her, but either it just didn't happen right, or I am a giant pussy, or a combination of everything. The only thing I can think of is that the reason I had no problem with everything before was that I was still in a relationship - no pressure, nothing to prove, no risk since I wasn't after a reward. Compound this with the fact that I have no game of which to speak. I don't really know how to approach girls. I don't know how to talk to them after I just met them. I don't know how to front the fake sort of bravado that Maxim and all the ""guy"" magazines sponsored by Axe Body Spray tell you that you need. In short - I am, was, and always will be a fucking scared little nerd. And now I'm a scared little nerd with 30 extra pounds and four years not having to deal with any of this bullshit.

Maybe this wasn't as bad as an emo kid's blog post on MySpace. Maybe it was. God knows it's filled with enough ""poor me"" to fill a few dumpsters. But shit, that's the way I feel. So fuck it. 

I mean it's not like I have a gun to your head."

The only songs that bother me are the topical ones on Iraq, but then again that's what BR does. They've always been political, not just cashing in on cheap political sentiment like some bands I could mention. *COUGH*GreenDay*COUGH*. 

I'd read a few reviews about it, and one of the gripes that most of the reviewers had was that Greg Graffin's vocals seem a bit muted. I have to agree. It seems like whoever was on mastering duty accidently bumped the lead vocals knob from ""10"" to ""8."" On some tracks, like ""Requiem for Dissent"" and ""Lost Pilgrim,"" I have to strain to hear the words. Plus, being Bad Religion, it's hard enough to catch words like ""proselytize"" and ""admonish."" I could kick that mastering engineer in the nuts. 

I also bid on a house yesterday. I'm nervous as all hell, again, but I should actually get it this time. I don't think the owner is a lawyer, unlike the last house, where he was, and I got screwed. As if I didn't hate lawyers enough already. What's worse is watching my friends who were great become lawyers, and then slowly turn into dicks. At least computer consulting just turns you into an antisocial hermit who hates the outside world, which I think was the path I was on anyway so it all worked out. But anyway, it's a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom, 3000 square foot 2-story place, built in 1990. It's in Savage, which is about where I saw myself moving to, with easy access to 35W/E and 169. I was over at Tony's last night and showed him. He wondered what the hell I was going to do with all that room.

As much as JT the Radio Slave sucked, Drive 105 was way more accessible to listeners than 89.3, the Current, the Twin Cities publicly funded ""I'm going to out indiecred you"" station. 

From the Star Tribune: 

""After four years of mostly unimpressive ratings and two years of hip competition from the Current (89.3 FM), Twin Cities alternative-rock station Drive 105-FM will change this morning to a new nostalgic format dubbed ""Love 105."" 
Hoping that listeners tune in, station operators remained tight-lipped about the programming.

""We're bringing back the great music from the mid-'60s through the mid-'80s that isn't being played anywhere else,"" is all that ABC Radio staff offered in a statement Monday.""

Ok... With a name like Love 105, it's set on auto-suck. If you're playing music from the mid-'60s through the mid-'80s that isn't being played anywhere else, there's a good chance that the reason for this is that the music is horrible. I also find it really hard to believe that more people listened to the Current than listened to Drive 105, unless the ratings polling were taken at concerts played with less than 30 people in attendance. 

... Actually, according to someone on the TC community, the audience polling is done via home phone cold calling. Drive 105's core listening audience is mostly a cell only crowd, hence low numbers. Evidently they saw the writing on the wall ages ago. They should totally change how they gather numbers for this.

What really sucks is now the Current is the only alt-rock station in the Twin Cities, and I'll be damned if I'm going to listen to that shit. For every single Beck song you hear, there are three songs done by a monkey banging on a two-liter pop bottle while elite buddhist monks sneeze in 8/9 time."

"event","Well, looks like I was outbid on the house. Despite having a verbal agreement and all the paperwork submitted (but not signed by the seller, that dick) someone came in and sniped my house from me. Technically it's not illegal, but it is a dick move.

According to my realtor, Vince, who's also a friend and our softball team's coach, and asian which has nothing to do with this story, most real estate transactions take between 24 and 48 hours. There are a couple back and forth exchanges while you haggle on the price, but typically purchase agreements are signed within 2 days. We had agreed on pretty much everything by Tuesday/Wednesday of last week.

The seller's asking price was $289,500. We haggled, I got them down to $285,000, but they wanted to close ASAP. No problem, compromise. Then the seller ""went out of town"" for a week. Uh, right. Went to a magical place where there are no fax machines, cell phones, or email. I... don't think so. Not if you've been trying to sell your house for the last 5 months, in this horribly soft market, received no bids all that time, and come to an agreement with the first bid ever. 

Something's fishy here. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but something just isn't right about it. I guess the upside is now I don't have to worry about trying to find a sublet for my apartment, since the lease is up in October, and I don't have to worry about lawn care, maintenance, buying a water softener, etc. I'm both relieved and disappointed. There are new houses coming to market all the time, and at least I know what the deal is now.

I toured a house yesterday that I'm thinking about buying. The thing is that it's gutted. The bank foreclosed, kicked out the previous owners, a nice cold Minnesota winter came in, froze the pipes. The pipes burst, flooding the house, and as a result there's nary a scrap of drywall or insulation in the joint. The upside is if I buy it, I can make easy money by renovating it, and could sell it for way more than I paid for it. Like an obscene amount. The downside is that I'd have to renovate it. Being a very Newtonian body at rest, I tend to stay at rest. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm not in love with the place, but it has a ton of potential, and the area it's in is exactly what I was looking for.

Well, it did have an unparalleled beer selection, and a rack called ""Mix n Match."" Make your own 6-pack by choosing from individual bottles. It's a really cool way of trying new beers out without committing to a full pack. We went back to my place and tasted 7 different brews while playing Fight Night Round 3 and Perfect Dark Zero. The beer that sticks out in my mind most - Jew Beer!

It's called HeBrew, the ""chosen"" beer. The kind that I picked up was called Messiah Bold - ""The beer you've been waiting for.""

Plus being on the shorter side it was harder to run cross-court, to serve it because the angle is shallower, and I always got schooled by anyone who stood over 6 feet tall. Lanky fuckers.

Now, it's different. I don't know if I'm better, but it's not nearly as hard playing. I take that back. It's more physically demanding, but my coordination isn't off anymore. I can aim stuff better, feel where the ball is better, spin shots better, hit shots harder. Downside? This game makes me feel old and out of shape.

I don't have a TiVo because I don't want to pay the extra cash. So what I do is download the episodes of shows I want to watch off of any number of crazy bittorrent sites. Then they're in Hi-Def and have the commercials cut out which is awesome. The only issue is that I have to watch them while sitting in my studio. This normally doesn't bother me, but I found out you could also stream your video files to your 360 and watch them on your normal television. The only catch is that one of the computers on your network would have to be running Windows Media Center.

I *do* have the cash to buy a new computer, but I really don't want to put a box together just for this functionality. I mean a Media Center PC is supposed to interface directly with the TV with S-Video or component video, or whatever the hell you have. The X360 is my substitute interface, so the Media Center should only need to be on the same network. Or at least that's my theory.

So to console myself, and spend money that I don't have (which I think are one and the same) I bought myself a new video card. Geforce 7800. Yes, it cost me a shitload. But it makes every game I own so beautiful that I weep openly. I've gone through three boxes of tissues. Only one of these boxes were used to wipe up tears."

"event","Ok, so Kyan Douglas doesn't recommend blow drying anything. That is, unless you have a chinchilla. And your chinchilla is exercising in the bathroom. And you've left the toilet seat up because you're male. 

So Kitty, being the crazy chinchilla she is, was taking her dust bath and like usual, I let her run around the bathroom for an hour or so. I usually hear bangs, clunks, and thuds. This time, I heard a sploosh. Chinchillas aren't supposed to go ""sploosh."" I open the door, and she was soaked. Near as I can figure, she sat on the edge of the tub, made a leap for the usually closed toilet, and went right in. 

Chinchillas have extremely dense fur with no guard hairs, so that means that moisture traps near the skin and can cause hypothermia and sickness easily. How did I spend part of my Saturday? Blowdrying my fucking chinchilla. Oh she hated that. Take an animal that rarely likes to be held, and then pin her down and blow hot air on her for a half hour. The funniest part was when she went from ""GODDAMMIT STOP THIS"" to ""OH GOD FINE, GET IT OVER WITH."" Chinchillas speak in caps. 

I go back to the night shift tomorrow at 9 PM. It should last about 6 weeks while we're doing installation pilots. Aside from wringing out a sopping wet rodent, I got my own hair cut today, gave a bunch of shit that's been collecting dust to my buddy Thomas to list on eBay, and spent quality time with my new Technics SL1200 M3Ds and record collection. There are actually a lot of B sides I haven't listened to on my 12""s. I recorded my set and for some reason when I play my set on my minidisc player it peaks and clips, but on the Minidisc deck I recorded it on, no clips. WTF.

In other news, I'm really digging this Bordeaux I picked up. I forgot how tasty wine was."

"event","Broke down for two things - a) an update, not like anyone reads this thing, or if they did, they don't care anymore because I never update; b) I bought a digital camera. 

Canon Powershot SD550, 7.1 Megapixel, happy happy joy joy. The best part is that I can expense it due to my company kicking royal ass. Also, they'll pay for my 1 GB memory stick. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do with all those megapixels, but I hear you can sell them off one at a time on eBay. 

The other thing I bought was a set of electronic fat calipers, used to measure subcutaneous amounts of blubber and calculate an overall body fat percentage. I've wanted a set of these for a while, and at $50 I'm wondering why I didn't pick them up sooner. Probably because I don't REALLY want to know the results. I have a sinking feeling that I'll try them out and a hideous electronic laugh will burst forth out of the machine, and I'll spend the day watching Oprah and drowning my sorrows in Ben and Jerry's. 

Well, if I actually liked Oprah and ice cream, that might work. Unless it was watching Oprah drown in ice cream. I'd pay for that shit. WHERE'S YOUR MILLION LITTLE PIECES NOW, BITCH!?

After losing the first weight loss contest versus the scotsman, the rematch is set to begin next week. Thus the need for the camera (hideously documented weight loss evidence) as well as the calipers (more hideous evidence). I also want my $100 back. Then I get to retool my diet, start counting things like calories and fat grams and portions, and generally not have a very good time. The thing that REALLY bothers me is that it takes so much time to count calories and fat grams and portions, and time I waste doing that is time I'm not sitting on my ass, wasting time. 

The one upside to the past few weeks - I've already done my taxes, and my rebate should be hitting my account next Friday."

"event","I have to say that Dryel is the greatest invention I've come across in a while. I was panicking because my ""nice"" pants for work (all whopping 3 pair) were in need of a dry cleaning. I was inches from throwing them all in the wash and just saying ""Fuck it,"" but if I ended up ruining them then I'd be Johnny No-Pants. While there are some workplaces where no pants would be appropriate, I don't work in one of em. 

The weird thing about my new job as a consultant is that I'm constantly being told to dress one level above the normal workers. I can understand we want to present the best image, but when everyone else isn't dressed nearly as ""professionally"" it's kind of awkward. Like the kid in elementary school who always was dressed up every day in slacks instead of blue jeans, or wore a bow tie during picture day. The kind of kid who you know just turned out like that one loser on CNN's Crossfire. 

I don't care what your point of view is, man. You're wearing a fucking bow tie. 

Anyway, Dryel comes with some stain remover, a bag, and some damp chemical cloths. I didn't have any stains on my clothes (I try not to soil myself very often) so I didn't need the remover. I stuck my 3 pairs of pants in the bag, threw in a damp chemical cloth, stuck it in the dryer for 30 minutes on medium, and that was it. They recommend you take the clothes out and hang them up immediately to minimize wrinkling, but that's just normal laundry procedure. It's also the reason I wore wrinkled T-shirts to work every day for the last 5 years. Fuck folding. 

Dryel cost me $8, and came with 4 cloths. I think it's $8 again to buy 6 more cloths. I think dry cleaning costs me $3 a pair of pants, if not more. So I saved money already, which is something I suck at. Go me.

The other thing I did was start back up at the gym. The ""Large Richfield-Based Electronics Retailer"" (I can't use the actual name) has a gym in one of their buildings. It takes up the whole first floor of Building D, and costs $25 a month to go to. So I done signed up. I lifted for the first time in a couple months yesterday. I'm not nearly as sore as I thought I'd be, so that's reassuring. They also did a body composition analysis on me. I estimated I'd be around 22% body fat, and I tested at 21.9%. It's a bit of a change for me, I used to be a natural 4.5% in college. Of course there wasn't really anything to me. I was about 135 pounds then. I'm 192 now - so to get down to a really nice 8%, it would be a reduction of 13.9% fat, or 26 pounds. My target weight would be 166 pounds. 

It makes me happy because up until this point I had been guessing what my ""ideal"" weight would be, and now I know for sure. What's even better is that what I estimated based on how I felt and my knowledge of my own body turns out to be right on. I suppose I could say something about body synergy and holistic centricity, but then teams of midgets would have to assault my nether regions with vicious little kicks. It's in the rules."

"event","I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a new car soon. I'm also pretty sure it's going to be a black 2002 Jaguar X-series. I test drove one today and I was giggling like a schoolgirl. A schoolgirl test driving a Jaguar, but a schoolgirl nonetheless. 

It felt a lot nicer than all of the other cars I've ever driven. I just don't know about getting a monthly payment. I've never had a car payment, but that's due to the fact that the newest car I've ever had was a 1989 Buick Park Avenue, which I'm currently rockin'. 

The funny thing is that a used certified Jag isn't as much as I thought it would be, especially since the new sticker price is $50,000. The only problem was it was the wrong color. I want a black X-series, and this was pearl. If I'm going to drop that much money on a car, I want it to be perfect. Jesus they're beautiful machines. 

Heh. I'm totally going to drive a Jaguar. That is dope.

When's the last time anyone called anything ""dope?"""

It makes me think that I could be staring at the most beautiful thing ever written, and the tragedy is that I'll never be able to understand it.

"event","I've been on overnights supporting a ""Large Electronics Retailer"" upgrade all of their systems from Windows NT to XP. I was originally slated to do this from Mid-September to October 31st, however they're extending the push for the upgrade through Mid-November. I am not happy. 

What's adding insult to injury is the dozen or so roofers and siders that have been working on my apartment building for the last six weeks. I get home from having my brain numbed, try to close my eyes, only to have crazy mexican whistling, hammering, and crowbars prying shit off of the building from 8 AM till 5:30 PM. Namely, the only fucking time I have to sleep. 

How the fuck long does it take to side and roof a goddamn apartment building? It's been six fucking weeks. If I had an AK-47, there would be some dead roofers out there, and at least you can get peace and quiet in the slammer. 

On top of this is possibility that I might have to do an additional six months of night work. I do get the right to say no, I don't want the assignment, but it's one of those tricky situations where I'd look like a fool for turning it down. I really don't want the assignment. However, it would make my company look really good to the biggest account in the Central Region, it would make me look VERY good for eating shit for so long, I'd be replacing a guy from a direct competitor, and I'd get 6 months of enterprise network engineer experience to put on my resume which is stuff you can't buy. 

The flip side? 

SIX MORE FUCKING MONTHS OF NIGHT WORK. 

The other downside is that what I'd be doing as a network engineer for said Large Electronics Retailer really has no value towards what I want to be focusing on. I mainly want to do migration work, from Windows NT to Server 2003, from Exchange 5.5 & 2000 to Exchange 2003, all that kind of good stuff. Maybe a bit of network design and architecture. As the ""network engineer"" I'd be troubleshooting tightly controlled installs - following a script. Probably doing a bunch of scripting also (which would be the most useful skill I'd pick up). 

I really don't know what to do. I'm also plagued with a total sense of a lack of meaningful accomplishment. I felt accomplished and shit working on new and exciting things, and now that it's lame shit, coupled with the fact that it's at night and has robbed me of a life, I just want to quit and do something I'd really enjoy. I keep coming back to forming a band and touring, and the more I think about it, the more it eats at me and feels right. 

I'm not cut out for this."

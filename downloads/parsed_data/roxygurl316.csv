"event","is it a trend for people to be attached??
cant people just be single?it tends to get lonely at times..
but look on the bright side...u get alot of time to do ur own things n u dont need to report to anyone.
y is it that some ppl r so proud of their bfs or gfs n some r not?
my mind is currently filled with these type of question..
relationships...can we live with it?can we live without it??"

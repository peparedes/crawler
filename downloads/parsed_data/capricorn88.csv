He still thinks he's boss b/c he helps out paying the bill sort of. It's pretty pathetic. I'm trying to paint a nice still life at school to somehow send to the college as part of my portfolio b/c it's a 18 X 24 inch canvas. Thats gonna be the only large piece I'm hopfully going to send. My main goal in moving out of state to college is to meet new ppl whose different from what I see in the north east all the time. CA is more laid back vibe and relaxing-- unless your a celeb or something. I wouldn't want to be Lindsey Lohan any day! (Although it would be really interesting to see how their lives are.)"

Thank God the following day SIX of us will be leaving to Cape May, NJ. I won't say no names b/c it will be ridiculous!

"event","It was alittle different that I didn't even notice some things like they knocked down the fences and made the beach more narrower. I know they must of added new sand b/c it had more rocks than pebbles! Esp. near the tides which made it more frightening to walk deeper in the ocean, but I made it there... (towards the end of the day...finually *haha) There food there is EXPENSIVE! Did you know that their frozen yogurt is $5.00! Next time-- I don't think I need to eat there. At one point my left breast popped out of my bikini top. I wasn't the only one to have that happen to me b/c earlier another girls breast popped out real fast. When that happened to me, I said thats it for today! I got a tan pretty fast too. I'm also going to Cape May pretty soon. It's much better than DE beaches.
     Acouple of days ago, I got in a heated arguement with my ""sister"" b/c I was fed up with her not ever ever ever communicating to me FIRST. I know at times she is ""working"" and ""studying"", but in her free time she chooses to never respond to me. I always have to be the one to communicate to her first. Personally...I feel as though over the years, her first priority is FOOD and SEX. Her obession with those TWO things has ruin her family relationships. She has all the time in the world to watch endless amounts of wrestling tapes...talk on the phone to guys... it's becoming tiresome to watch her make a fool out of herself with men. I do not know why she does not want to talk to me. I want to bond with my family members more ( but not my father) b/c I'm planning on going to art college soon, which happens to be out of state. So when she doesn't talk to me, I feel as though she is underestimating me and I do not like that. I also feel she is not giving me any credit or encouragement, but it's ok that I do that to her. She had must of forgotten our past through ugly, false relationships... which is a pity. In the end, I believe she will be the sorry individual -- not me. I'm just trying to help b/c I sense that she'll need it someday. You never know what you got 'til it's gone."

I know revenge is sweet, but for us, it was bitter and sour. I hated being out there on the bleachers for 2 hours *Sigh*"

"event","Yesterday me, Nicole, Jaime, and Toby went to Old New Castle by the shore to take a walk and see a fake replaca of an old colonial ship. This real hige guy was the host who explained the background history of the ""showboat"". His face was red like a red hot pepper and his body made him look like a walking meatball!!! LOL Anywho... the whole time I was walking around, my left foot kept hurting b/c I must of tore something in it. After that, we went back home to eat some supper. My mom was video taping as Toby and Jaime was dancing around and what not. We also had music playing. When it got real late at night, me and my mom was playing loud music outside the window b/c thank GOD my dad wasn't home. I didn't know what came over me, but I started to giggle ALOT. LOL Then I was being an ass on the partyline with my mom on the other end of the phone. I said some shit like, "" Your balls smell like sour doe. Now I don't want to eat potato chips. Thanks! You changed my diet around!"" Nicole and Toby was in the living room, where I was, and heard me. I guess they thought it was funny, obviously *hehe*
      My dad went to church last Sunday, but now this Sunday he doesn't b/c the church service was too long for him. I guess an excuse to keep drinking through the day. What a shelfish A-hole. His excuse was he didn't have any money to donate. I mean, alot of ppl go to church w/o some little cash to give up. I guess he gets paranoid and neurotic too easily. (Shhhh- someones weak!)"

Things that bother me during this whole year will soon pass when I am away from school grounds for awhile. It always occurs.My last day is June 10th. Four days earlier is seniors last day. On May 13th is prom night. I don't know why ppl are so siked about it...I mean... Newark sucks...*hehe* Theres a bunch of better schools out there. Besides, who wants to go to a dance with ppl you see almost everyday that fucking annoy you? Not me. I'm not a senior yet, but I've always had that idea of not going to school parties and that includes proms at that, like for a long time. I'm naturally a suspicious person who is not easilly gullible. It's just not me! My mom is planning on bringing James to Six Flags with us w.o my nephrew this time b/c he is still too young and restless to come with us. My mom just wants to have her hands free--God dawn it! LOL"

"event","I woke up at around 4AM and opened my bedroom door to go to the restroom, and I just saw a ""guy"" just walking out of it. I quickly said sorry and shut my the door. I later found out that it was HECTOR who had apparently came over at 3AM. He had just lefted and Nicole claims that they didn't do anything. My dad is now getting on her case about NOT EVER LETTING HIM IN THE HOUSE AGAIN! Besides that, she also told me that the doctor told her that she has high blood pressure. I timidly told her she should avoid alot of diary, meat, and starches. She should lower it by eating more FIBER--vegetables and fruits. We are so opposites. The doctor said she should manage her weight and they tell me I should gain! I eat a fresh, pure diet and she---well, an typical American diet! Nothing wrong with that, but when it comes life threatening, then something has to be changed. Like her stop smoking for instance. That will annoy the hell out of her b/c tobacco is a bitch to get out of your immune system once it's immune to it. Ya know?!?"

"event","Another rainy day and I'm bored as hell as usual. The prom at school is on May 13th, which is on a Friday so yeah... if thats not freaky enough. I don't know who decided that date, but I'm guessing a ""gothic"" type did b/c theres alot of them this year at my school. Theres acouple whose a senior and freshmans who are friends with them. It's weird. 9th graders are friends with the 12th graders...I tell ya', what a rare year indeed.
     Yesterday, Nicole got her little check and gave my father some money for food. He bought 2 set of snacks then went over to the young boys house to spend that money for crack or weed (whatever it may be). I didn't know what was happening b/c I woke up with no one in the house. Nicole went with Toby (udswinger) to the mall. I'm thinking 'wtf' for a minute until my when I had the door open, my dad came in all energeticlly saying, "" Oh, I'm next door. I'll be back adn we're going food shopping tomorrow (although it turns out we didn't)."" My mom called before he came in saying she'll be coming home. SHe was waiting for the bus to come. I was then hoping for her to bring home the sweeteners, but when she did came home, she FORGOT! Thankful she was up for changing her clothes to walk with me down to the super market. We had to wait for my dad to come back over b/c she couldn't find the money in the room. My mom was so fed up with him that she took off Jaime's clothes b/c my sister had just came over, but as usual, left again to do her own thing b/c I guess she feels she lefted out fun times in her teen years that she's making it up now in this stage in her life, which is sad. But anyways, she was so fed up she took off his jeans and said that he has to watch him while we'll gone. When we was at the market, we had went alittle over (only had $40) and had to put some things back. If that wasn't embarrassing.... it started pouring down rainning as were walking out of the place! LOL I have to admit, it felt wonderful and fulfilling! In other words-- refreshing! The last time I was caught up in the rain was as a child, but I had gotten really soakin then, hehe. Right now I could tell the sun will be out more than the other day, but partly cloudy. I would have to say-- this month of May will be ""FLOWERY"", which is a beautiful thing. Flowers bring optimisticism and all that brings positivity. Thats what the world needs and exspecailly me~!"

Tomorrow is suppose to suck b/c of rain in the forecast. I thought I saw gray clouds out off and on, but... Tonight I have to do my math h/w and then read chapter 10 in this real life story about a struggling african in Africa. It's a good book, I suppose, but I'm not into book reading at THIS time in my life. A couple of years back I was, but those moments come rarely, if ever. If I do read, it's usually a quick study about myths and theories. At school, I accidently slipped alittle on vegetable oil that was on the floor. (We occasionally use vegetable oil when working with clay) It was so embarrassing. I was trying to play it off. *LOL* Anyways, I was making a sculpt of a monster. I just finished glazing it so the next step is to fire it in the ""kiln"" (a special oven for heating up clay-like materials). I used a couple of colors so I hope it doesn't all look like a mess. I be dawned it does b/c I sculpted it nicely. Usually the glazing part fucks up the whole sight of it if your not careful. I might give it to my mom for Mother's Day, but why such a ""evil"" looking ""gift"" for a ""graceful"" holiday? I have to second guess that."

"event","The Full Moon -- energizing 5 degrees of Taurus and Scorpio -- clocks in at 3:07AM PDT. This is also an """"appulse"""" or penumbral eclipse -- a little less significant than a partial lunar eclipse. The key moment of the eclipse is 2:56AM PDT. What's most important to realize is that this particular Full Moon is celebrated around the world by metaphysical and esoteric groups. It is called the Festival of the Buddha (in the west) and Wesak (in the east). It is said that the Buddha himself -- as an exalted spiritual teacher or master of the Ageless Wisdom -- returns from his high place and blesses humanity in a secret and secluded valley somewhere around India, Tibet and Nepal. Whether you believe this is possible or not, there are millions of people on Spaceship Earth who recognize this event as being real. The bottom line is that individual and group meditations are recommended. Send out positive thoughts or prayers to dear ones, family members, humanity and the kingdoms of nature. A Ceres-Saturn trine in water signs (12:09AM PDT) can help bring parents and children to a better understanding of family problems. A Venus-Jupiter 150-degree aspect from Taurus to Libra (6:09PM PDT) is a reminder of last Thursday's Vesta-Jupiter conflict in the same zodiacal signs. The meaning is practically the same -- don't be hasty about changing your investment strategy or tackling a major business project. The go-slow approach works best right now."

"event","I got in a arguement with my ""sister"" b/c shes an unfit mother. She always leave her son up to my mom and I can't get any word out to my mother. She claims I have no friends. But when she was 17, she only had 2 of them. I have many infact. There just associates. Many kids at my school has them also. It's so unfair that when she was my age, she didn't have to worry about a child getting in the way. She was worried about HAVING a child. Nicole is such a lazy bitch. Of course unfit mothers would quickly make excuses for themselves. I don't believe any of it, but apparently my mom is a sucker to her. I do not fall for her bullshit. It's not something to be playing around with when you have children! Stop going out to clubs and leaving your son to my mom who works her ass off then has to come home....well- you got the whole story. It's just not getting through to her that my mother will not alway be there for your child. You see, she takes after my Aunt on my dad side who likes to have other people take care of their kids. It's really pathetic. Yeah, I admit it, I have some problems, but doesn't everybody? What does that say about my sister after she said I have issues? It's saying that she has an easy going lifestyle with her mother doing her job. Nicole is in her own world, which includes many men, clubbing, drinking, smoking, and one-night stands. She just jumped right into that lifestyle without any carefulness. If she wants to be so stubborn about it, then I might as well wish she die. Then maybe she doesn't have to ""suffer"" anylonger or worry about catching up on being a FIT mother. Now that doesn't mean losing weight, which she worries about too much and as a result, binge eating overnight anyways, but to work at becoming that role."

What are they trying to tell me? I can't quite figure that one out! It was never this way before. What are they ""envying"" me about? If its what I think it is, well that sounds really pathetic! Selfish behavior will get you no where nor jealousy. Let alone, society view me as a ""beauty queen"", which isn't a bad thing, but it could only go so far. I'm not as an intimating person as people may think. I have a softer side thats bashful and shy. I need a break too at times. I'm only human and I could only do so much. I hate getting tangled in situations like this. It really confuses me. I begin to question my status, like whose bothering me? How are people annoying me? What am I doing wrong? I mean, I really think its rediculous that I should question myself over dumb shit like this. I guess the most simplist situations in life COULD go too far. Like being beautiful, being healthy, and being smart. But I really never regret having them all. Simply, never."

"event","My school's prep-rolley is on Friday and Juniors suppose to wear red. Don't ask me why exactly...I don't think I have red, but I could try and see. I played hooky yesterday and didn't go to school. No one knew. I was going to do the same thing today, but then I was like nahhhh. I told my peers at school on Monday that I MIGHT not be there and they went to school, I guess, on that day. Now I came, but they didn't. I feel alittle salty. Almost all my classes were empty. I guess they really wanted to enjoy the hottest day of the week...let alone the last for acouple of days."

"event","I believed and followed a myth,
I soon discovered the harsh truth in reality.
I was puzzled and numbed by the fact.
People's true colors began to surface.
They pictured me and spit on my image in their minds.
I was quick to change their view of me, but how could I if it was there from the beginning?
Then again, I was puzzled and numbed...
Theres nothing I could do to change the core of some individuals.

"event","I went jogging yesterday for about 30 mintures. It felt great, but I felt not as thrilled with it b/c it's my first time in awhile. I really enjoy running.... I also went home and did some yoga stretches with weights. It's only 2 Ibs. I'm going running again...until I'm good at it again."

"event","Yesterday, I went in town to go spring shopping for school and it felt like a nice day. I think I heard all week will be like that. I bought a long purple skirt and a pink shirt, but the shirt is made for ppl with big breast. Idk...it's hard to explain w/o seeing what I mean. Anyways, on Monday my mom is going to the hotel with James again. She showed me the home video she had him in and accidently showed me the quick part of him, I guess, masturbating on the couch. It was really crazy. I screamed, ""Mommy!"" I had to take myself a walk. Then I was like, ""That was all a nightmare...just a scary dream."" My dad went to a family BBQ at his father's house. (I don't like to say grandparents) After that, he came home drunk and hanging around these young boys who uses him for cash b/c thats all my dad does.... acts like a sucker. There not his true friends. His true friends are too concerned about him for so long that they have just given up on him. What a sad story, isn't it? Also yesterday, Rob came over really fast, but I'm not sure just yet if he came back. He Nicole video taped him alittle. He seems like a very bashful kinda guy cuz he seems rigid in meeting me. I could tell Nicole was showing-off before he came in his brother's chipped colored car, by smoking outside when it got chilly out that night. Earlier that day, when Rob was still sleeping in bed with Nicole after drinking the night before, my dad snapped about having  company in the house. He just started to say he got to go and he did. Apparently, he thought it was Hector again. Besides all that.... Nicole has a LOVE ADDICTION. If someones reading this right now, please go look it up b/c the symptoms of that disorder applies to Nicole very well."

"event","Today was a HOTT day! But it was more sunnier yesterday though. My mom got paid today so we're ordering out. I'm, of course, ordering mixed vegetables! She just called about 20 minutes ago and there still not here. Why do we always order fast food when its spring time? I guess my mom gets greedy during this time. I'm the opposite - it's too dawn hot to eat something hot ALL the time. I'm offically a fruitarian...*wink-wink* Yesterday I went jogging for awhile and now my lips are sun burnt and at the same time I'm running out of my good chapstick. (It's medicated)"

It isn't pretty b/c I had the feeling that made me not sleep one night in 2003. I didn't know what was making me anxious! Lets just say, it feels like a panic attack."

"event","My sister is such a slut. I read her LJ and she said she did a 3 sum. I only knew about the one with June. She's talking about doing it 2 years ago with some ""ugly"" guy name Rob and she claims that I was arguing b/c I had a cold! That wasn't the whole story... This is what happened. All week, me and my mom had to take care of a 2year old little boy. Now you heard of the ""terrible twos"" have you? Ok, well then I came down stairs to talk to my mom about my health concern b/c I felt weird and haven't felt that way before. She happened to be in the kitchen and as I was trying to talk to her, Jaime kepted talking purposely on top of me. (He always be in the kitchen with my mom AND talks over me when I'm speaking to her - only her) So that really pulled the trigger there. All week was a mixure of excitement, stress, tiresome, and exhaustion. So I had it up to the heavens with him! Not like I was going to hit him...oh no. Precious Little Princess wouldn't do that...! But yeah, I started yelling at him to ""shut up"" and ""Get the fuck out of the kitchen!"" I'm not ashamed one bit b/c Nicole slutty ass does the same thing, but worse. She actually hits him, even when he doesn't really bother her that bad. I was annoyed when she started to say, ""Jaime, come here! Before I yell at somebody else."" I was like, to myself, ""Oh no she didn't! I can yell at her ass too. (No problem and it wasn't.)"" In my veiw, she's still stuck in her teenage stage. Being lazy, eating fast food, being a night owl, which leads to no rest, and boy crazy. That is a terrible, reckless lifestyle. She needs help! She's calling out by doing those things. It's so pathetic....LOL I had enough of her bullshit lately. Lying, sleezy bitch! Sounds like I'm mad, right? Nope! LOL I'm not the one whose going to die or get raped (raped? I think she'll be eagered to spread her legs) by going on blind dates too often."

"event","My trip up PA was chaotic! Jaime kept gettin' on my mom's nerves b/c he cries and runs around too much. I told her that she should of not brought him here. She agreed at the last minute. She said he ain't coming over next time b/c still at 3 years old, he'll act the same was as 2 year olds. 
      I'm trying to pick my fake nails off fingers b/c they look crappy now.I just got them done on Friday! I paid $25 for a french manicure. Personally... I don't think she did the french painting well.
      I have a little cold. I hope it isn't the flu b/c sometimes I feel alittle cold or warm and somewhat dizzy. My aunt's next door neighbor had a cold so I probably got it from her. I went to her house one night with my aunt and mother. She was giving out candy or maybe at Gary's mom's house on Easter day. There were alot of ppl at the house. I strongly believe I got it from there."

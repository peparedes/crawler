"event","Last Sunday, the day before the fourth anniversary of our first date, I asked Regular Joe to marry me.&nbsp; He said yes!&nbsp; In fact, he was planning to ask me, but hadn't worked out all the details yet. 

Last night, he asked my parents for their blessing, which they gave without hesitation.&nbsp; I didn't get the opportunity to ask his folks because of logistics, but they are very happy. 

So, it's official.&nbsp; I'm marrying Regular Joe, probably in May, 2010, in a small personalized&nbsp;ceremony. 

I am, of course, very happy."

Sarah is a real licensed plumber, member of the UA Local 130 here in Chicago, and the Chairperson of Chicago Women in Trades Board of Directors. Beth Barton, who is the chair of Missouri Women in Trades (MOWIT) has some questions also.<br />&nbsp;<br />Beth Barton, a 29 yr. old Journeylevel Carpenter, is from the rural town of Luebbering, Missouri. She commutes 50 miles each way to work in St. Louis, Missouri.&nbsp; After working as a Certified Nurse&rsquo;s Assistant, for just a little bit above minimum wage, Beth put aside her healthcare (low-wage) career when she became pregnant and found herself raising her first child alone.&nbsp; Beth, who grew up on a farm, realized she could do heavy lifting for higher pay by becoming a carpenter. Rejections from dozens of contractors didn&rsquo;t deter her quest and she finally found one willing to hire a woman and&nbsp; she was able to enter the Carpenter&rsquo;s Union Training Program as an apprentice and join the union. She is a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 1596.<br />&nbsp;<br />Five years later, Beth is now completed her apprenticeship and is married to a union carpenter and raising five children. Her favorite job was making someone else&rsquo;s dreams come true, by building a house for charity.&nbsp; She is her family&rsquo;s primary breadwinner for now, since her husband, like many construction workers in this failing economy, is unemployed. Beth wonders what the new administration will do to create job security for women like her working in the construction industry.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sarah the Plumber, Yvette the Electrician, Pam the Painter, and other tradeswomen like them have yet to hear much about the issues that matter most to them.&nbsp; Times are tough for all construction workers, but these tradeswomen want to know what will it take to crack through the concrete floor to gain and maintain secure high-wage, high skill jobs. Here&rsquo;s their top sixteen list of questions for the candidates:<br />&nbsp;<ol><li>How can women who left TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families- also known as welfare) to take personal responsibility for themselves and their families, (and found themselves in jobs that paid minimum wage with no benefits), gain access to training and job opportunities that provide them with the wages and security to achieve the American dream?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>What will be done about providing working mothers (and fathers) with affordable, quality, accessible childcare during our nontraditional work hours?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>What are your plans for ensuring that working women (or any person) who has/adopts or cares for children, the sick and the elderly can get paid family and medical leave like almost all of the other major industrial nations?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>When will women not have to work four extra months to have an annual salary equal to men&rsquo;s wages?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>If we get into the &ldquo;old boys network&rdquo; will there be a safety net to ensure national health care? Can this cover our spouses/domestic partners and children as well?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>When exactly does the statute of limitations run out on pay equity? Is pay equity a trial lawyer&rsquo;s dream, or a simple woman&rsquo;s hope for (spare) change to pay the babysitter?&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>How much energy do women have to expend before we get (financial) independence (or at least a 23% discount on our bills to reflect the wage disparity)?&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>Do we have to kill a moose to demonstrate we can handle tools or provide leadership on the job?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>How many bridges (or highways and high-rises) do tradeswomen have to build to stop being seen as &lsquo;just&rsquo; homemakers and breakground into male-dominated jobs?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>When can we anticipate that the free market and voluntary corporate efforts will level the playing field for women and people of color? When can we expect reparations for the disparity created by race and gender discrimination? Is this covered in the bailout bill (TARP) under executive compensation?&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>Can we expect the government to actually enforce safety regulations on the jobsite and ensure that personal protective equipment like hardhats, safety belts, gloves actually fit a woman&rsquo;s physique?&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>Is the bailout (rescue-recovery plan?) a bridge to economic equity for working women, (and people of color and men), and exactly where does it go?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>Is a pink hardhat safer than a bonnet to protect us from the falling dollar and crashing stock markets?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>How much straight talk will it take before gays and lesbians can move from being just &ldquo;tolerated&rdquo; to full equality in our work, civic, military, family, and love lives?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>If we change &ldquo;business as usual in the beltway&rdquo;, how many documents will a worker need to be treated fairly and equally for day&rsquo;s labor and to share the wealth they help to create?<br type=""_moz"" />&nbsp;</li><li>How many &ldquo;hands across the aisle&rdquo; will it take to create a bi-partisan bill to rescue women from second-class citizenship, low wages, and discrimination on the job? Can poor women be appointed to fill all the positions on the oversight board to assure compliance? Can full childcare be provided at all meetings?</li></ol>We are all wondering why so much time and money are being spent in this campaign on lipstick, acorns, derivatives, and banking bubbles while working people are barely staying afloat, and some of us have already fallen victim to floods, foreclosures, predatory financial institutions and illegitimate wars.&nbsp; We never bet the bank on our futures, it wasn&rsquo;t an option. We just work hard for them. Can&rsquo;t our elected officials do the same? Can&rsquo;t the media be more than weapons of mass distraction.&nbsp; Will someone listen to our ideas about what a real bailout/rescue/recovery plan that is a bridge to economic equity for working women, and men of all colors can and should look like. We actually have the tools, unions and know how to use them to produce real family values and products worth investing in.<br />&nbsp;<br />Lauren Sugerman<br />Executive Director<br />Chicago Women in Trades<br />o/312-942-1444 ext. 214 c/773-704-3627<br /><a href=""mailto:lsugerman@cwit2.org"">lsugerman@cwit2.org</a><br />&nbsp;<br />Contact Beth at: <a href=""mailto:jbbarton@peoplepc.com"">jbbarton@peoplepc.com</a>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><em>Chicago Women in Trades (CWIT) is a nonprofit organization committed to improving women&rsquo;s economic equity by increasing the number of women working in well-paid, skilled trade jobs traditionally held by men.

outside of work, i am the Secretary of the Board of Directors for CWIT, a co-facillitator of Women in the Pipe Trades, dating Regular Joe regularly, still trying to find the best relief for the fibro, and the only errand-runner and laundry-doer in my home.

so, i apologize for being out of touch, both here and by other means.&nbsp; your best chance of communicating with me is by phone, with email being the runner up.&nbsp; be persistent.&nbsp; i'm sure there will be another lull sometime!"

"event","I'm so freakin' proud of myself.&nbsp; I waded through the mire yesterday and came out on top.&nbsp; Of course, the people who respect me and want to keep me at My Company had already laid groundwork.&nbsp; But I'm proud and touched that they cared enough to try to protect me in my absence. 

The Bunny told EVP that it would be a big mistake to make me the new BK, that it would be a waste of my talents and greatly increase the risk that I'd jump ship too. 

Leo told EVP that I was just the person for the job.&nbsp; He told me that it's mostly what I have been doing, and certainly nothing beyond my capabilities.&nbsp; And Leo will be there as a resource for me. 

EVP told me that although this is not exactly what we'd talked about a month or two ago, it is temporary, and it is part-time.&nbsp; He told me that wheels had been set in motion to get BK out from under Keebler's thumb.&nbsp; He told me that he still intends to utilize my QA/QC training and experience, and that this BK project will just be filler until&nbsp;other work comes in.&nbsp; He told me to visit the site, and to learn&nbsp;as much as I can from this opportunity.&nbsp; I told&nbsp;him that I was reassured, and looking forward to the opportunity.&nbsp; And I asked for a raise, which he seems reluctant to grant.&nbsp; I just figured if I'm doing BK's work, I should get BK's compensation.&nbsp; But I can live without it.&nbsp; I'm proud of myself for asking.&nbsp; 

And this morning, when Keebler tried to foist his work on me, I handed it right back.&nbsp; I was surprised at how smoothly that went.&nbsp; And now he ought to know that he can't fuck with me.

So, yeah, good.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;"

""No, this is the way it's always&nbsp;been done.&nbsp; I don't know that&nbsp;EVP wrote that.&nbsp; I don't understand why it's such a big deal to you.""

""I have worked very hard to become and excel as a pipe fitter.&nbsp; I believe it was EVP's intention to show me the respect I deserve by placing me among the people with similar job responsibilities to mine.""

""But X isn't a pipe fitter, and he's at the top. [blah blah blah]""

""Okae, well, frankly, I don't understand why it's a big&nbsp;deal to you to do what EVP asked you to do.&nbsp; If you don't believe that he signed his own initials to the move, I will talk to him and have him tell you directly what he wants.""

""Fine.""

Really!?&nbsp; She wants me to go to the OWNER and get him to tell her to do what she should have already done 3 times over?&nbsp; Okae.

Later, when EVP looked a little less busy, I explained the situation to him, letting him know that Lady was obstinent but trying&nbsp;not to bad mouth her.&nbsp; He was upset that I wasn't where I belong on the sheet.&nbsp; I felt so vindicated!&nbsp; I asked about the gender segregation, and he said it was a throwback to when gender and job description created identical separations.&nbsp; But that it needs to change.&nbsp; :D

It kills me that my biggest run in with sexism thus far in the trades&nbsp;is with a woman.&nbsp; And although at least one other woman thinks&nbsp;I'm a hero for standing up for myself, I think some of the others might feel snubbed.&nbsp; It sucks donkey balls.&nbsp; You win some, you lose&nbsp;some.&nbsp;"

I said, ""Does that make much sense to you?&nbsp; Cuz it doesn't make much sense to me...""

""Well, yes.&nbsp; The girls hardly ever leave, but I have to sign the guys out all the time.&nbsp; Besides, I didn't know it was the EVP [even though he initialed it]--people write on the sign-in all the time--they draw stars and all sorts of malarky.""

This is a sort of abreviated version of the convo.&nbsp; I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, so I left.&nbsp; Today, I'm going to ask her to move my name to the section EVP intended.&nbsp; If she won't, I'll take it EVP, and maybe even get the whole thing alpha (there are several guys who never leave the building too).

"event","<p>&nbsp;I hit upon WalMart*-as-a-metaphor last night, and I'm trying to flesh out the idea.&nbsp; Wanna help?<br /><br />The basic idea is that shopping at&nbsp; WalMart has far greater negative outcomes than positive ones.&nbsp; Some of these are:<br />cheaply-made goods that do not last<br />replacement costs<br />driving well-made goods out of the market<br />disposable culture<br />no livable wages or reasonable benefits for employees<br /><br />Now, what I'd like you to do is suggest <strong>Alternatives to Shopping at WalMart.</strong>&nbsp; So, tell me what you think in a comment.&nbsp; This is the brainstorming stage, so just spit out whatever comes to mind, and I'll cull the list later.<br /><br />Thanks, in advance, for your help!<br /><br /><br />*Although many retailers exhibit some of the same traits as WalMart, I find that it is a convenient, um, target.</p>"

"event","friday night,&nbsp;Regular Joe and i made tacos.&nbsp; this is an activity we have perfected.&nbsp; we&nbsp;each know our roles, and the results are always immensely satisfying.

saturday morning, i went to work, and was very productive.&nbsp; i tied up a bunch of loose ends, pushed some others forward, and discovered that my big fuck-up was limited to the 4 drawings i already knew about.&nbsp; i&nbsp;also figured out some big tasks that i can delegate.&nbsp; so i left at noon, instead of the usual 4:15.

i went down to the CWIT workshop, where the&nbsp;latest pre-apprenticeship class was experiencing Pipe Trades Week.&nbsp; It was really nice to see something i helped to create come to fruition&nbsp;independent of my late involvement.&nbsp; i'm very happy to be able to step back a bit from this&nbsp;and&nbsp;still know that it will be Good.

Saturday evening Joe came over and we had popcorn for dinner.&nbsp; mmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;saturday was our ""anniversary""--as much as non-married people who started out with a contract of&nbsp;""This is NOT a relationship"" on that date can have an anniversary.&nbsp; but we mostly celebrated on sunday.

Sunday, we slept in, fooled around, had breakfast, fooled around, napped, went to the art supply store and had Kik Alicha and Yemisir Wat for dinner.&nbsp; it was fantastic!

even physically, i feel a lot better this morning,&nbsp;with the pain and stiffness restricted&nbsp;mainly to my neck and shoulders (from&nbsp;which it never ever really leaves).

and this afternoon, i finally get my IUD!!!&nbsp; yea!&nbsp;"

"event","i had this fantastic dream last night.&nbsp; well, part of it was really creepy and involved having sex with people i didn't want to have sex with.&nbsp; but the cool part was this superwoman who was sort of like the villain from the second spiderman movie.&nbsp; her legs were paralyzed so she had these mechanical limbs that were flexible, strong, and&nbsp;telescoping.&nbsp; she moved really cool.&nbsp; she and i became friends and went shopping together at this resale shop.&nbsp; i wish i could describe it better.&nbsp; the setting was really dark and bleakly industrial.&nbsp; she fit right in.&nbsp; oh, and the resale shop had really great cookies&nbsp;in a hundred handbaked varieties.&nbsp;yum.&nbsp;"

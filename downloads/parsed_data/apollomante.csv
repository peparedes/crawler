People are ignoring me. Refusing to talk to me. am I that repulsive of a person? its not just one person either, it feels like easily half of the people I met after high school. When it rains it pours I guess. I just don't get why someone would do that...

I don't know why I'm posting on this journal. What do I hope to accomplish? a guilt trip? the only person who matters, wouldnt care, and besides that, is not someone I want to guilt trip anyway. 

I guess it just feels like, ""matt, dont stop writing in this journal, we all still care about you"" but then no one really does seem to care. not even the people who ""make an effort"" to contact me. Leaving me a message on aim everyday isnt the best way to do it. 

Am I just whinning for attention? I dunno, but some attention would be nice. THe trouble is, I'm not sure who I want it from. 

And its not like I want to be a bother! I just don't know what else to do..."

"event","well today looks to be pretty shitty. I have work today, and then the last dress rehearsal before friday's performance, but even teching isnt really going to cheer me up to much. Although, this whole ordeal has been stretched out over the past few nights, so its kinda like, at least now its over, I can move on, and I was somewhat prepared for it. 

But that fact of the matter is, I would say most of the people that read this journal, read it because of my relationship to Madeleine, and probably wouldnt really had we not been going out. I've always thought that this was kinda silly, but now I'm just considering doing away with live journal entirely. Why not? What do I keep track of in here? Anime conventions and shitty days. Lets face it, no one likes to read a friend's entry about how shitty there day was. Hell, most of you might have stopped reading by here, just because its shitty. So why should I bother talking about shitty days? As for anime conventions, I really dont think that I have the motivation anymore. Why should I? I work, I go to school, why should I have time for that stuff if I'm doing my life right?

So that being said, it seems that I might just be done with live journal, or at least this live journal username, as most everyone that reads it, no longer has any reason or moral obligation to.

Also, it has been brought to my attention that I am pretty lousy at more roles than just being a techie. The person who brought this to my attention knows who they are and knows what I mean, but it sucks for the rest of you who are reading my rant that I put here because typing it out makes me feel batter. Well fuck you guys, its not for you!

Ehem

What is it with people who can't make up their mind after so long? sure big decisions take time, but if you just cant make a decision about something important, then maybe you just dont care, and if you dont care, then say so! Don't fucking drag out the situation, just end it quick, or go with it, but choose one! flip a coin if thats what it takes to be decisive! But dont drag out other peoples time and energy and emotions because you dont care. if you prefer, you could say "" because you are apathetic"" if that makes it sound better to you, but it means the same thing."

Warcraft is boring but I still play it all the time.

There is almost no information about the race I want to play in Barry's Exalted game.

Long story short, my parents and brother over react to everything, and the rest of my family (uncles and aunts) are just waspy jerks. It was the last time I get guilt tripped into going to a family get together. 

But yesterday, after getting home to the city, I got to hang out with Mad, and everything was better. We just lazed about and I don't remember the last time I felt so blissful. It was really nice ^_^"

I think it landed on a glass bottle, because it sounded more like shattering than squishing. the carnage, at first, seemed minimal, until I looked at my neighbor's walls, for there were the remains of the black seeded menace. The air outside my window smells very sweet right now. oh god, I hope it doesn't go rancid. This is the result of me not having enough to do during the day.

"event","As odd as it sounds, This was prompted by a USA television commercial. The commercial features 3 detectives, The guys from the new show Psych, the guy from the show The Dead Zone, and Monk. The first two are talking about how they envy each other, Psych says something along the lines of, I am jealous of you Dead Zone, you can just touch stuff and see things, a real psychic! Dead Zone: Yeah but you have a photographic memory, thats so cool! Psych: but that took years of training! Dead Zone: I only got my powers from being in a coma for years! Psych; I have a lousy father! The camera pans over to Monk in the next booth lining up his corn (off the cob) into neat rows and counting to 100. The Dead Zone and Psych guys decide that things could be worse. The commercial ends with the tag line for the station: USA, characters welcome.

At my very first gaming convention, Sam, Adam, and I were in a game called Shambles or some such thing. We were zombies, and had to conceal it. To describe my character, I had lime green bowling shoes, a checker tie, and some kind of nice shirt. This is where the creativity ends. I was in Marching band, had a thing for a girl named Shelly, and had allergies (all of this perfectly described my life in high school at one point or another). At this point Sam blurts out ""You just described you!"" I never felt so embarrased in my life, here I was, in a Zombie RP! Looking the fool! I should have been on the top of my game, but I really wasn't. My Character sucked. 

I tried to make a interesting cleric in the D&D game I'm in, but the idea of roleplaying Dick Dauntless was to great to pass up. The twist for my character is that he is a wimp one day, and Dick Dauntless the next. Every time he falls asleep he changes to the other person. 

The challenge: Make a better character out of Dick, despite the fact that I have already made it far to complicated and unimaginative. 

I need to find a way to create better characters. Maybe if my Star Wars D20 kicks off well, I can work on my characters with my NPCs.

Who knows, if I can make ConQuest, maybe I can avenge myself."

The person who ""spoiled it"" for me was a liar after all! Fuck her! Well, certain things were true, but not who did certain things. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might care, but the spoiler I was told made Julia seem like a cold hearted jerk, when really no one was. I think that both Spike and Vicious showed alot of class. You always get this vibe that they hate each other, and that might be true, but I think they also loved each other. Or at any rate had some deep lasting camaraderie that saw through every situation they were placed in. Especially at the end where they gave each other back their weapons!

We normally completely enjoy each others company and the time we spend together is always memorable. But today was slightly different. We still went out for coffee, had fun at a nearby park, but at the end when I would normally tell Adam, see you soon, and give Patty a ride home only to call her some name in jest and flash my highbeems at her as shes walking home, I gave them both a hug, told Adam to try to stay alive in the army, and told Patty to keep her chin up and enjoy herself in Arizona. 

I knew this day was coming, I knew that I would have to deal with the thought of never seeing either of them again. I always wondered what I would do in that situation, and now I guess I know. In highschool I always knew that certain days would eventually arrive, but I never really thought about them. I thought that I would probably be dead before I finished high school. But then I graduated. That was easy enough to deal with. When Madeleine and I got together, I knew she would be moving to SF, so I waited till I had roommates available and I moved up there too. One day in the next few years, I'll be moving again, where depends on who I am friends with and so on.  In the mean time though, I knew that Adam and Patty would be moving on from sunnyvale, but the fact that they are gone is really surreal. It definitely hit me with Adam a while ago.  I knew that I would be sad to see him go, but I felt that sadness over a long period of time. With Patty it didn't hit me until I gave her a hug goodbye and she said ""I don't want to leave.""

Explain your livejournal name and its meaning. When you're done, tag as many people as there are letters in your name.

ApolloMante is a combination of two different gaming handles I use. 
Mante (think of it like Montei if you were to use japanese pronunciation) was the second WOW character I made. He was an undead warrior, and I was trying to think of a name. With undead comes (at somepoint) the idea to make a dante's inferno reference. So I chose the name dante, but with an M for Matt instead of the D.

Apollo is from a screen name Apollo Control. I got the idea when listening to a song on Stark Raving Mad. the song was called Apollo Vibe. 

Apollo is my nickname for my self.
Mante is the name I give at restaurants and fast food joints.

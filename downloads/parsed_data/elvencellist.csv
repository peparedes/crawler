"event","Well, now that I'm here I might as well give a real update.
Starting classes back in the fall. Looks like I'm going to be going for a Masters in Heritage Preservation with a focus in Historic Preservation. I'm really excited because one of my first classes is totally getting to dig through some of the apartments on the Martin Luther King Jr. historic site in order to get official documentation for anybody looking to do something with those apartments. Apparently they're pretty shady, but I'm not going to complain because I get to crawl through their attics. I'm reminded of when we got to go into the ceiling at Chartres... what is with me and getting to crawl around in the dirt of old buildings? It's so freaking awesome!

On a similar note, work is trying to keep me full time. One of our HRs has nominated me to corporate to interview for a co-op their doing with their social media. What do you know, Home Depot's  twitter and facebook aren't updated enough (do they even have anything?) and they're trying to get with the times, and so will be really working on that department and I'm getting interviewed. Haven't heard anything in about a week but she definitely sent my name in so I'm pretty excited to even be nominated. Of course it means more work but who cares? OMG did I mention here that I'm finally a Head Cashier now? Thank goodness I'm doing SOMETHING that doesn't feel quite like a dead-end anymore. At least now I can claim I got a raise/promotion and I'm at least MICROmanaging, right? Come the release of the hiring freeze that might actually mean something.

I need to hurry and download all the DLC for Dragon Age now, though, and play through it quickly while I have the time. I'm still squeeing a little over some of the Awakening stuff that I haven't even had the time to try out Darkspawn Chronicles or Leliana's Story, which I'm super excited about. I absolutely love her, almost as much as I adore Alistair. Kris gets so tired of hearing about it... Alastair at work, too, come to think of it. Poor boy has to suffer my amusement just because I love his name. It helps that he's a total sweetheart but nothing like the pixelated object of my affections. Bioware is so bad for my irl relationship, haha. Not that the pending FFXIV is making this any easier. I may need to look into a new computer for that and just learn how to multitask my games, since the PS3 version is coming out a whole 6 months later (wtf?)

Anyway, Aqua Teen is coming on the television so I think I'm going to take over and actually play some Dragon Age while Kris is distracted with Monster Hunter. God knows he dislikes ATHF about as much as I do. Alistair, it is time to rule together!!!"

Otherwise been a boring day. I like getting up at 7, as I have been lately, because normally I wouldn't be up until now or later and already I've gotten done more than I would like for the day. Which is, of course, grow nearer to completing this game with which I am totally and shamelessly obsessed. Awesome.

Day wasted pretty well, considering now my car is all no-longer-recalled and the tire pressure is good again. Maybe I'll get the mileage I'm supposed to be getting with it now.

Going to Varner's tonight with Luke and Kris for 1/2 price wings, too. Kris actually had wings yesterday when we went to Taco Mac with my family -- family being mom and dad and my dad's visiting sister +children but that's ok, he really likes wings.

But I'm still here, I promise, and I have at least had lj on my mind nearly every day.
A lot has happened since... a week ago? Mike was in for the weekend to celebrate my father's birthday, in which I gave him the wonderful surprise of seeing my brand new tattoo.

Heck yeah I finally got that tattoo. But I'm waiting for it to heal before I really start letting people see it. Mom's reaction was bad enough (and I know I'm not convincing her it's perfectly healthy until it actually LOOKS it). But I haven't had a single regret yet.

And I'm looking to move up at work. Most of my coworkers agree to it, it's just a matter of convincing management that I'm ready. That would be nice. The application is in, anyway. Hopefully I'll get interviewed in the near future.

And this mac sucks. Sorry Kris, I will never be an Apple person. I can't type on this thing worth nothing. So I'm calling out now, and hopefully will see you guys in the near future with another entry."

I've just decided that tags in journals shouldn't exist as they seem to be peculiarly worded (as my own failures reveal) and take me back to times I don't think I really want to read about. How embarrassing!

But it feels so good relaxing after a hard days' work of dealing with returns. Honestly, one would think that people could just be honest for a change instead of returning all their stolen shit and making me deal with their insolence. And how about just taking it out of the packaging at the store? Filled an entire Homer Bucket (that's 5 gallons) with empty packages that we found in our clean up yesterday. They all had to be marked down and marked up to make sure we got them correctly documented, and it was almost tragic looking at the dollar amounts. Oh well. HD isn't missing out on too much I guess.

I need to get in touch with techops, too. I'm hoping to volunteer for Dragon*Con this year and techops is the place I want to be. Now if only the website would e-mail me back, that would be fantastic...

And in other news, upon failing to post this entry I discovered that posting it on my cell apparently puts the entries like 6 hours in the future. Will not be posting from the phone until I figure out how I did this."

On similarly upbeat notes, I got my third Homer Badge today which means fun rewards in my next paycheck, and I won the dirtiest associate award for our rack diving -- a yearly process which involves cleaning out all the shelves in the store and usually encountering a number of questionable year-old things including small dead rodents (not me, thank goodness), cobwebs, and leftover charcoal/box cutter blades/screws/etc.

Ah, but there is so much work to do before then.

I'm trying not to worry too much because it looks like I can get away with about 8 euro more than I'm supposed to and that SHOULD be enough to buy the really pretty fabric that I found. Now I just have to get to constructing this... thing. Hopefully pictures will come up on facebook or something. I'm really excited to see the finished product.

Anyway, I just stumbled upon this post by <lj user=""sushikat""> and couldn't resist. But I'm going to be doing tagging. >.> Which is everybody.

Once you've been tagged, you have to write a blog w/ 10 weird, random things, facts, habits or goals about yourself. At the end, you choose 10 people to be tagged, listing their names & why you chose them. Don't forget to leave them a comment or message saying ""You're It!"" and telling them to read your blog. You can't tag the person who tagged you. Since you can't tag me back, let me know when you've posted your blog so I can see your answers.

1. I really like to read fanfiction. I think it's more comfortable for me because I already recognize the characters, I can get a wide range of writing styles (from terrible texter to Shakespeare), and when you read fanfics you are almost in complete control of the story line. Don't like what happened in the latest part of your chronicles? That's okay, there's a fanfic out there for you and you won't be dissatisfied.

2. I would kill to be part of some sci-fi/fantasy story. Seriously. It is my one unattainable dream.

3. Shoes are my life. My clothes may be bland, but I take pride in my accessories and my shoes.

4. There are three careers I would love to take when I ""grow up"": Actress, Writer, Archaeologist; I'm too greedy to risk not making enough money to try to take them. I stick to Architecture because it lets me design and that's pretty fun, too.

5. I tend to be a bit of a bitch, but really it's just because I'm stronger and more stubborn than you.

6. I'm more self-conscious than I let on. Really, I'm mostly just afraid I'm the chick forcing others to hang out with me because they can't say no.

7. I'm a total nerd when it comes to games and TV. If it isn't strategy, science, or a comedy, you can pretty much count me out. Discovery, Nat'l Geographic, and SciFi are my life though Cartoon Network gets its own air time, too.

8. I've been with Kris for four years and dammit, I plan to be with him twenty fold more -- if that was a surprising fact at all.

9. I terrified about living in France for a year. People keep telling me how different it is and what a culture shock I'll be having. Still, there's a part of me that's telling me I'm finally free and I really can't wait.

10. Erm....Oh! Traveling... is my thing. Be it a long nature hike and a campsite or a nice stay in a resort, if it's not in a familiar environment chances are I love it."

"event","Ok, I'm feeling better. I can't help it if I get overly emotional over things I get too attached to.

Anyway, <lj-cut text=""if the internet has not yet ruined the book, I certainly will. And so will the comments on this entry."">I must warn you and I'm angry, so brutal.
I guess I'm going to start at the end, since it's probably the only thing I truly believe shouldn't have been written (as opposed to shouldn't have happened T_T). We've been reading the Harry Potter series for how long now? And every time a new one comes out, understandably it has skipped most of the summer following the last year of school, but never really anything major. And if we really missed something major, Rowling is sure to tell us all about it in her, ""Here's what happened in every book before this in case you're too stupid to go read those, too."" (To be honest, I didn't mind the updates too bad after all) I can even accept, with open arms, thanks, the huge time skip in the beginning following Harry's delivery to the Dursleys. It was appropriate, it was explained rather vividly.
To be blunt, I liked the prologue. The epilogue, I think, needs to be ripped from the book. For starters, it jumps way too far in the future. Sure, 19 years seems a good idea if you're just randomly picking a number and then saying Harry had kids when he was early twenties (a bit early for me, but who's judging?) Except not really, because any good literature buff knows the worst way to finish a book is to do a huge time skip and show everybody how much breeding has been happening while we were away and most likely wondering what happened to the <i>after</i>. For a children's book, it's almost forgivable. For Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a very much NOT children's book, it's a sorry excuse to make the ending HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.
What happened with cleanup? How was the ministry fixed? Did Percy finally fulfil his dream of becoming Minister? How did they gather the remaining Death Eaters?Did Ron finally magically forgive Harry for having been an ass to his sister? Draco married some nameless face? Is she a muggle or a halfwitch or a pureblood? Questions all dodgedly answered with a vague, ""yes, they happened.""
And what about the unanswered questions? Like why Luna and Dean suddenly seem like a feasible couple at the end of the book (or did I read too far into the hand holding?) What happened to Luna anyway? Because I also thought she'd end up with Neville, and I was really pretty ok with that, too. I guess we'll never know for poor Luna Lovegood.Who the hell became Minister of Magic immediately following? Do we just assume Percy, or was somebody more worthy given the position first? I personally think Kingsley should have (unless I missed him dying, of which I wouldn't be surprised). And who else died?  Is Kreacher alive? Surely in the group when Harry knew practically EVERYBODY fighting, he's going to know more than the 6(?) people bothered to be listed--50 other casualties occur.

Which brings up another [rather touchy] point and the whole reason I'm still suseptible for boohooing. It's not about Remus and Tonks, or Hedwig, or poor Snape. It's about the overlooked twin. I mean, seriously. I went into this book telling myself this: I'm going to be perfectly ok with anybody who dies as long as the twins come out ok. They're my favorite character, and I say it like that because despite how many twins spend their lives defining themselves from the other, Fred-and-George were just that, a character. They pranked together, ate together, played together, left Hogwarts together, lived together, worked together. Everything, together, until book 7. I had a bad feeling when suddenly the plans meant the twins had to split up, and sure enough the mentioning of specifically Fred and George not returning at the beginning of the book raised some serious fears in me. And of course, George lost an ear, but it's ok because even he was able to joke about it (a relieved sigh actually escaped my lips upon his pathetic line about Sainthood, but Fred was right, what a <i>sorry</i> joke). However, when the book started focusing more on Fred than George (who only appeared everytime all the Weasleys were there and spoke very little as opposed to Fred's pretty steady conversation and appearance on <i>Potterwatch</i>, and then when the twins yet again split up, I suspected something was very, very wrong. It sure doesn't help that they seem most forgiving to Percy (with whom they were probably closer than most), or that of course Percy went with Fred. Of course he had to die. One of the Weasleys did, and all the others with whom we're already familiar have had horrible things happen to them in the past. No, the part that particularly bothers me about the death of Fred Weasley is that it really is JUST Fred, not George too. And what happens to our grieving twin, who by far probably suffers the most (exlcuding those who actually die)? Who knows, Rowling doesn't even cover it. No matter that George may never be the same person again, that Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes may be forever lost, that the infamous Weasley twins will never cause stress and chaos again. It was only Fred, and not Harry or Ron or Ginny (and personally, I wouldn't have minded seeing Ginny or Percy go in Fred's stead).

Speaking of characters whose stories should have gone differently , poor Snape. I mean, is it ever clear whether or not the man was on Dumbledore's side in the end? Even so, what a sorry and abrupt way to die. And then to have your sorry past read out like a fanfiction (one of which I'm sure I've read before. Maybe Rowling borrowed some text from ff.net?) It seemed rather childish to me, but I suppose it's another of those OMG WE HAVE TO MAKE IT END WELL SO FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF. A bit like Dumbledore, unfortunately, whose monologuing I had to stop reading for a bit just to take a breather from the angst. Seriously, I could have definitely gone without Albus belitting himself to the point of annoying. We got the story three times in the book before, we didn't need it from another persective. Harry had already worked it out, and so had we. Albus really should have just stayed dead. Honestly, a whole chapter to tell Harry he can and probably should just go back? Ridiculous.
Quite a few other things made me a bit edgy about the writing, but I'm kind of tired of being bitter, so let's discuss things I thought went well. Like Neville Longbottom, whose growing importance in these books has captured me and made me absolutely love his character. The boy can do no wrong, aside from his pseudo-squibdom, which has clearly passed. He's noble, not that bad looking after all, pretty smart, not angsty in the face of certain and passed doom(unless SOME heroes we know), and brave when he needs to be. Not to mention a constant source of entertainment. But I was so glad when he appeared in the mirror. The boy's absolutely selfless, and has been in the whole series, and who doesn't admire him for that? He maintains Dumbledore's Army despite his weaknesses and takes absolute and total shit from Death Eaters the whole time he's at Hogwarts. Honestly, the boy undergoes torture for Harry. And then for him to be honorable enough to freaking kill the snake after being on FIRE? I love this boy. To pieces.
Molly Weasley used the word bitch. Sketchy. Awesome. Kick ass, woman. Exceptionally frightening knowing [one of] her son[s] is dead, and I can't believe Bella had the nerve to bring it up. Crazy lady.
Ron and Hermione FINALLY. Over SPEW and in front of Harry, how perfect. I really just loved how this finally worked itself out, however random, just because I know Rowling has been teasing us and teasing us with it for ages. The woman was writing this couple for herself, for crying out loud. I'm just glad to see this plot point coming to a close. I really do like this couple, although I really can't say I like how it was handled for the story up until Hogwarts. Ron, jealous of Harry, whom he knows is totally lusting over Ginny? Hermione wasn't into Harry, and never really gave the impression. Horcrux or not, Ron's behavior was rather pathetic.
On the topic of Horcruxes, who totally called Harry being one? I'm not the only one, I can tell you for sure. Hundreds of people called it. But the plot was a little too predictable. I had most of the deaths worked out even before the book's release, and the plot was worked out long before then. I'm a little disappointed that it was that simple, to be completely honest. And Harry totally should have stayed dead, by the way. I feel pretty stupid, but I still haven't figured out exactly why he lived aside from something silly involving magic or fate or whatever. If it's not as cheesy as I understood it, somebody please explain this to me? Because I must have missed something, or else he should still be dead in my book. Maybe Rowling was just too in love with her Harrykins to finish him off.
Wish she had been that way for Fred. I bear this icon for you, Freddie.


P.S. How are the Malfoys? Did anybody hear anything?</lj-cut>

On to the real topic. I saw Transformers on Tuesday (got there 5 min before the movie and actually gor in, woot) and I really must say I could make an entire entry on that. Having grown up a fan of Transformers, I could probably write a whole essay. Regardless, I wanted to make this post to let you guys know that I've nearly wet myself at the idea of JJ Abrams Cloverfield. 

I'm sorry, <i>Untitled JJ Abrams Project</i>. Nearly wet myself because it suits my tastes PERFECTLY. I can't. fucking. wait. Look it up. Try to watch the trailer... if you can find it (I have faith).

"event","Whew.

I gots so much to update.

I guess I should start with my trip across country. Literally. Unless you count the 2 hours to the East Beach, but that doesn't count considering how many hours we did ride. Anyway, I helped Kris and Rick move much of the Hutley Clan furniture to San Jose, Cali. So we rented a U-Haul, stuffed it full, and began driving. It was so gorgeous. To be honest I slept through just about all of the South because I've seen it (and lets be honest--it's all trees anyway). But soon as we were out of Arkansas on the second day, it was like a whole new world all over again. Granted I lived in Houston for a few years, but it was strange for it to suddenly be DRY and FLAT and able to see for miles. And holy cow was it beautiful. The people were really nice, the roads weren't that bad (with the exception of OK) and I watched the most gorgeous thunderstorm I have ever seen. Of course, this was the same storm that all through OK City had our eyes peeled for tornados (and I didn't even get to see one funnel).

And then we hit up New Mexico, which was a whole new experience for me (and to be honest, one big blur of cacti and dust). Then we hit up the Grand Canyon, which was a little out of the way but still worth it. It totally snowed while we were there. I have tons of pictures but I have to translate them from their raw format, so it may be a while. But stick around because they're totally worth it. The snow was gorgeous and completely unexpected.

I guess I should sum up the rest quickly. We successfully made it to San Jose and just in time for Fanime. I can officially say that my Convention cherry has been popped, and I am addicted. It was so much fun that I've alreayd planned our Dragon*Con/AWA adventures. I know I'm totally jumping in over my head here, but I'm thinking of attempting Ashe and Basch for Kris and I for those. I'll have to get started immediately if I even want any hope of getting the armor done in time, but I'm really excited now. Btw -- all my seamstress buddies dying to do some charity work -- I am/have taught myself the art of sewing but clearly we all know that means that I suck, so if I can commission you or something into helping/making some stuff for me... *puppy eyes*
j/k. The whole project will probably fall apart like it always does. But Fanime was awesome regardless.

Then we hit up San Francisco, which if somebody hasn't been there, I highly suggest it on a warm day. It was quite cold while we were there but it was very nice to see everything nonetheless. Monterrey Bay was the same, as were the Red Woods. They were all gorgeous and I got some ok pictures on those days, so again I'll have them up ASAP.

My wrist is hurting now though so I guess this is me out. Maybe one day I'll actually have a real update, or at least a long one.

btw, going camping tomorrow SQUEE"

To think such a beautiful campus, such a fantastic college, could become so quickly a bloodbath...

Bush really said it right this time. School are supposed to be our sanctuary, our homes for knowledge, where we can give life... and today, they were a place where no campus felt safe, and life was taken insead.

They are all in my prayers.

-Nor dread nor hope attend
A dying animal;
A man awaits his end
Dreading and hoping all;
Many times he died,
Many times rose again.
A great man in his pride
Confronting murderous men
Casts derision upon
Supersession of breath;
He knows death to the bone
Man has created death.

for months, i've been telling people we'll sell out of badges this year, and we MIGHT do it before the event even starts, but its gonna be close. magfest may hit the attendance cap entirely in pre-registrations, but i'm not sure. it'll be close.

the production on this one is better than any i've seen so far, in pretty much every way. even the story, writing, acting, pacing... they're decent. usually if the VFX or costumes or choreography is awesome in a starwars fan film, something else is abysmal. usually the pacing and the acting. this one is at least passable on all fronts, and impressive on some.

yes. i am breeding. spawning. procreating. reproducing. janis is carrying my demon seed.

to answer the obvious questions - how did this happen? was it planned? is it a good thing? is the world doomed?

... i have no idea. except maybe for that last part.

ok.. see... a while ago, we started talking about the concept of having kids, in a mostly abstract sense, like what would we do if something went wrong and suddenly found ourselves with one on the way. we discovered we didnt really hate the idea. eventually we kinda liked the idea, but agreed we werent really ready. but then we kinda felt like nobody is ever really ready, but they all seem to do it anyway... and somewhere in this meandering indecision, we seem to have made the decision for ourselves.

yes, we're happy about it. also a little freaked out. we arent that freaked out by our own situation, but the timing and complications around us are less than optimal.

check this out:
the plan was to come out here to MD, to an empty house. we could clean the house, free of other people being obstacles, and i could put more effort into magfest, and start up this visual effects stuff i'm trying to get going.

it was a decent plan.

the reality:
my brother, and one of the little sisters, are still living in the house. the place is full. the VFX project is behind schedule, but blah blah blah whatever, that was expected, really. i've added people to the project, and some of them are now living in the house. the house is full. :P

the punchline:
there are 2 little sisters. one local, in the house here, and one in brazil. the local sister freaked when we told her the news a few days ago. she called the brazil sister to tell her, and the conversation went like this:
""i have something important to tell you.""
""no wait! i have something REALLY important to tell YOU!""
i stood there face-palming in slow motion, while this repeated a few more times. sure enough... the brazil sister is pregnant. she found out on the same day.

i wish i was joking.

brazil sister will most likely be keeping the kid, even tho shes young, mentally unstable, unemployed, STUPID, and her boyfriend is even worse. she will most likely be coming up here, and living in this house. ... the house is full. :P

so. i'm stressing. things are not according to plan. timing is bad.

but i'm happy. and janis is happy. she seems very interested in this new thing we're doing. and if she's happy, i'm happy. so we're happy.

and definitely a little bit crazy."

info is starting to show up on rock band 3. you'd think i'd be tired of this stuff, especially since i never really liked the genre in general before, but check this out:

- jump in/out of songs any time, in the middle of the song
- 3 part harmonies, like in beatles rock band
- keytar. this means 7 people in the band at once. and the keyboard, kinda like the drums, is actually a viable trainer for the real thing. they're stepping up guitar and drums too, with a 'pro' mode thats got a bunch of much more 'real' instrument stuff going on.

now.. the punchline... they put out a queen pack for rock band a while ago, and THE SONG was conspicuously absent.

just down the street theres a church. you can see it just to the left on the map, sticking up on a hill jutting into the ocean a bit. the cemetery attached to the church got wiped out in a land slide recently, so if you get up close and look, theres an awesomely gruesome scene of stripped away earth with graves sticking out of it.

damage taken:
will: moderate sunburn all over the back. bloody nose and a few good scrapes from various attempts to get a canoe into the ocean.

janis: a few good scrapes from climbing around on the rocks near the church.

me: nasty sunburn around my shoulder blades, where i didnt get the sunscreen far enough down my shoulders.

all: mosquito bites. motherfuckers. i hate mosquitoes so much. will was coating himself in bug spray constantly, and he still got nailed.

in completely unrelated amusement... portuguese has just as many fucked up pronunciation quirks as french or english, but they're mostly different, so theres a lot of confusion... example: the word spelled 'legal' (means 'cool', as in fairly awesome or neat) is pronounced kinda like 'lay-GOW'. they do 'L' sounds, but only in certain parts of words. i'm constantly amused listening to brazilians talk to will. they pronounce his name 'WEE-ooow'."

so i tell my friends its super cheap down here, and the brazil/US economies conspire to screw that one up. i tell them the weather is great, and we get record-breaking rain and flooding.

i've also told them we wont be getting malaria or getting kidnapped, i've told them its safe to drink the water, i said we'd have no problem getting internet connections......

the comedy will be updated as it progresses."

"event","so... its not quite biblical or anything, but the flooding in rio right now is enough to fuck up traffic pretty bad, and the worst of it is about 4 blocks from here. the rain is supposed to continue like this for a few days, so it looks like we're stuck here.

janis ( LJ <lj user=""starfallz""/>&nbsp; ) and will ( http://c0.cribzero.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=1314 ) have been posting things, so you can check out some of their thoughts and pictures there.

for me, the interesting thing about this trip is the small differences. this isnt the brazil i'm used to, or the brazil trip i'm used to. almost, but its a little off this time.

this is the first time i've brought anyone with me. its always been family, and maybe some friends of the family, but this is the first time its been MY friends. my family is relaxed and loud. get a bunch of them together, and 20 conversations about 20 different plans, events, and whatever will erupt all over, the plans will change, then maybe get moving, then change again mid-stream... and everyones pretty much ok with this. this is how we do it. 

will is paranoid, and janis doesnt like changing plans. this makes things a little interesting. mostly i grin at them a lot, because i know everything will be fine, we're not going to get kidnapped and pick up malaria... shit will happen, it'll be fun, or boring, or whatever... and thats how it goes. we're here for a month, but i dont think its nearly enough time to cure these 2 of their neuroses and bring them fully into my family. =]

the big difference, though, is economic. all my life i've known brazil as a horribly unstable economy, with hyper-inflation. when i lived here in the 80s, and then visits since then, the economy would occasionally take such insane dives that they'd have to replace the cash, knocking a bunch of zeros off in the process. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_cruzado ) 1000 to 1 jumps, every 5 years or so. this made american money worth a shitload. you could stroll around this place like a king pimp, tossing pocket change at things with casual abandon.

they seem to have fixed their shit, finally. its pretty amazing. the exchange rate is something like 1.8 to 1, and its been holding there reasonably for the last decade, apparently. it helps that the dollar has been relatively weak for a while. this means that instead of paying 1/3 of what something is worth, the prices are all normal. kinda sucks for us tourists, but its great for brazil.

another thing is the favelas. when i lived here in 84, there were a bunch, but they were just a part of the place... not a big deal. now, they're fucking EVERYWHERE. they've grown unchecked in the last few decades, and its gotten completely insane. every available spare surface is coated with that strange organic growth of super cheap shitty shacks. the odd thing is life in rio doesnt seem to have changed. theres 10 times more favela, but the more affluent middle to upper class sections of rio seem very much the same. the favelas are there, but they dont seem to affect anything, even in the overwhelming state they're in now.
theres a nice panorama pic in here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favela
and if you look at rio on google maps, you'll see the word 'favela' come up more than anything: http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=-22.939741,-43.230515&spn=0.110344,0.251827&t=h&z=13

there are apparently some sincere efforts to fix the favela situation, i've heard about a few promising things. between that and the general economic state of things, the next decade should be very interesting for rio. theres a lot of potential. they're getting the world cup and the olympics here within the next 6 years. rio could be on its way back up. i'll have to come check it out more often. =]"

"event","i think i'll do this in a bad news / good news format.

bad news: my grandfather died.

good news: he was 96, lived a good long life, was a good guy who helped instill a lot of good qualities in his entire family, and never passed up the chance for another 'good' pun. he went peacefully in his sleep on sunday morning, which is nicely appropriate, he was a lutheran pastor. i'm not sad. i kept smiling about it all day sunday, because i was thinking of my grandad and his life. when someone finishes a video game with a high score, or makes it to the end of a marathon, you're not sad because its over, you give them a hi 5 because they did so well. i'd be sad that i couldnt give him a hi 5 right now, but the family has been getting together for reunions every year for a while, so we've been doing that every summer.


bad news: i shut down 'launch', my laptop that i've had running for the last 5 years straight, yesterday. it served me well through a lot of things. i have a lot of memories of 5 years of interesting life, with that laptop along for the ride. it had a POV picture i took of the first launch on the volcano, as its desktop background for its entire life. its being retired only because its old, not because its broken.

good news: its been replaced. the new hotness has a quad core i7, renders literally 10x faster than the old one, and is pretty solid all around. its black with red trim... so i named it 'runner'. it makes the PEW sound from the original laser tag gun when i log in.


bad news: the first thing i used runner for was a 48 hour film fest. i got the iowa crew here together, and we did some effects for the most elite 48, the panasonic HD showdown. invite-only, just 5 teams. we put in a lot of effort, things went pretty well over here, but in MD, on my brothers end, they were getting hit with the snowpocalypse. the blizzacaust. they got something like 500 feet of snow in a week. everyone on the east coast is living in igloos they carved out of the glacier they now call home. the snow complicated a lot of things, and the finished product we delivered was merely ok, rather than the awesomeness we should have pulled off.... aaaaannnd... it had no sound. it took kevin 2 more days to get everything on his computer to play nice together and actually output both sound and video.

good news: i can actually show it to you guys. no waiting for screenings or DVD releases or anything, its been posted online. with sound! =]
http://www.48hourfilm.com/competitions/showdown/
ours is 'baggage claim'. if we'd actually made it in with sound for the deadline, we might have had a chance. its on par with the others. oh well. the opening shot is still awesome. we did some good stuff."

"event","AKA snowpocalypse. Snowmageddon. Etc.

We struggled and fought, overcame distance and a bad genre pick and 3 feet of snow and crappy net connections and bugged out editing software and swarms of locusts, etc... and in the end, we DID crash a plane, and everything else, and turned in a short film just in time. Yaaaayyy!!!!

Toward the end, kevin's editing machine flaked out more and more, till he was practically editing blind. He could only watch a few seconds of video before the whole thing locked up. He didn't even get a chance to watch the film before rushing out the door to turn it in.

....turns out he delivered a film with NO SOUND.

"event","this one is super special invite-only panasonic HD showdown. 5 teams get picked, out of like 2000... they send you a camera, and if you win, you keep the camera.

we got invited based on gwendolyn dangerous, the same thing that got us into the recent international one.

the problems are piling on top of problems. the ultimate final blizzard of doom is annihilating the entire DC area right now, just as we get started. kevin was set up to work at CDIA in georgetown, but with the snow he's gotta stay home... he can barely even edit the footage at home. we only had 3 weeks notice. one of the requirements is that we use at least 50% of the crew that did the qualifier... but kevin is in DC, barry (the other director) is in LA, i'm in iowa, and ed (the other effects guy) is in england.

... and the genre we drew? suspense / thriller. we're useless at this shit. kevin is writing a totally generic 'scared people lost in the snow' script, and he's struggling.

<lj-cut text=""email from barry"">
Hey all,

I'm on a plane flying to LA with a huge smile on my face, because we all rocked this weekend out.  We love the end product... it is gorgeous, moving, exciting and funny.  Every single person involved - actors, artists, production designers, producers and all - have something new and great for their demo reels this time.  And us too... which is huge.
 
We have shot a ton, and we've shot with budgets and professional crews, and when we can do something like this in a weekend volunteer effort that stands up with the best we've ever done it speaks volumes to the level of support we got from you guys.  Knowing that we had such a talented cast and crew let us step up and script some of our best and most ambitious moments and know that you guys would all be able to deliver and drive it home.  We're truly blessed that you guys gave us your weekend with the trust that we'd make it worth your while, and we're sure that when you see the end project you will agree it was.
 
To that end... we'll have a cast and crew screening when I'm back in DC, but I'm not exactly sure when that is... probably within the week.  Additionally, Mark Ruppert, the creator of the 48, is in talks to do a screening for all the local teams that participated... either in a theater or at the French embassy.  We probably won't put it online before then ... hate to tease you that way... but we're just so excited to see it with you guys and share the excitement of a first viewing.  We'll get it on line after that.
 
Soooo... thanks again from the bottom of my heart.  You guys rock, plane and simple, and everyone on the cast in crew is on our short list for all our next projects. 

Have a great week.  God bless.  And Merry Christmas.
 
Barry
</lj-cut>

... the last line is an inside joke.

if you want to get the joke, you'll have to come to the screening. =]

this means it wont be posted online for at least a week or so, till after the screening.. so.. you'll all have to be patient. =]  i'll of course post a link whenever it goes up."

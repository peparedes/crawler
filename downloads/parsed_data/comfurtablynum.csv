"event","Well I've been living in Cypress with David for a week now. School also started this week so I've been super busy. My room is finally all set up and it looks really nice I think. School is crazy. It is ridiculously huge and crowded and parking is horrible. It's been a tid stressful and to top it off I got sick right when school started with a bad cold. At least the first crazy week is over though and now I have a three day weekend. Yay!"

"event","Good news first...
I got admitted to Cal State Long Beach! I was totally shocked when I got a letter from CSULB saying that was admitted due to increased funding from the state legislature. Thank you Arnold. Haha. I'm so so so happy. Now I get to go to school with my honey face and no community college for 2 years for me. 
Ok now the bad news...
My Baily birdie was killed by Astrid Friday night when David, his sister, her boyfriend, and I were at the fair. She got out of her cage and Astrid found her and killed her. I'm so sad. I loved that bird so much. Everyone did and they were so depressed. Some good news though is that David got a new bird. It is a green wing macaw and his name is Rett. He is the biggest bird I have ever seen. I really like him. He's a good bird. We may still replace Baily with a new cockatoo someday if we save up enough money. We'll see. We also got a lionhead baby bunny this weekend but Astrid was too insane with it so we gave it to Katie. She's really happy and so are the kids at the daycare. The rabbit is so crazy looking but he's really soft. Well I'm off..."

"event","Tonight David, Khaled, and I went to see the Rush concert at Irvine Meadows. What I saw of the show was great but it was interrupted when some stupid jerk started yelling and cussing at me to sit down. Nevermind that everyone (about 50,000 people) in the whole stinkin ampitheater was standing. We were on the lawn and everyone was standing to see the stage except him and his friends. He continued yelling and then he threw a cup full of beer at me, splashing me and David all over our backs! I waited for a bit and then I went to find security. Unfortunately it took me about a half hour to find the right person and when I did the guy was gone. His friends were still there though and the security guard talked to them. They lied and said they didn't know the guy. I told one guy in particular that he was lying and I saw his friend sitting with them when he threw the beer. He just played dumb drunk. So the security guard said he would wait nearby till the guy returned. The friends left and the guy showed up. One of his friends told him to run as I went to get the security guard who I couldn't find. I thought the guy had escaped but this security guard was determined to catch him and we wound up finding him (not hard to do because he had an orange mohawk). The friend I had told off before admitted that his friend did it and that he was sorry but then told the cops later that his friend didn't do it. We had to go down to a police station at the ampitheater and file a report. I pressed assault charges and had the guy put under citizens arrest for ruining our night. I guess we'll see if the charges go through and I have to face the guy in court. Geesh what a night."

"event","Today was not so good at David's house. I was there for about 30 seconds and then we had to leave. But David finally got to go to the chiropractor because his neck has been hurting him since he twisted it in jiu jitsu. His chiropractor is so creepily insane but at least he feels better now. 
I got my new snake today. :) He or she is a high white king snake and has marking that I think look like a leopard spots. I got David one too for our 1 year and 2 month anniversary. It is a 50/50 high white king snake with black and white bands. Hopefully we got opposite sexes so we can breed them in a couple years. The breeder also keeps thousands of mice in his garage for food and gave us a few pinkies and one fuzzy for David's bearded dragon.I fell inlove with the fuzzy and I'm making David let me keep it. I bought some milk for it and we're going to hand feed it. It's sooo cute. Awww...
Tonight I'm supposed to go see Jenny with my mom. I haven't seen her in ages and her kids must be all old now. I haven't seen them since they were toddlers so it should be fun."

"event","This weekend David and I went to Palm Springs with my mom and Michael. We went to the waterpark there on Saturday and it was 114 degrees outside. Our feet were sizzling on the pavement. i went on this crazy waterslide that is open and drops you at a 90 degree angle from a million feet up. It gave me the worst wedgie of my life! I remember Kelli went on it years ago and she said the same thing. Haha. 
We also went downtown to see my mom's friend's band play and then to a karaoke bar where David was asked by some skank to join her in the bathroom. Unfortnately I wasn't able to kill her because he didn't tell me until after we had left. Oh well. 
Yesterday it was David's nephew Nathan's second birthday and there was a party at David's house. It didn't end well though because of a ridiculous incident with the racist neighbors and some cops. I don't want to get into it but now David's dad had a heart attack and is in the hospital. I feel so bad for him. Hopefully the chaos with the neighbors will subside soon. 
Tomorrow I'm going to get a king snake hopefully because my geckos died. They were anorexic for no reason. Oh well I want a snake anyway."

"event","My mom got the job in Palm Springs and is moving there by September. So I'm moving in with David sometime soon. The pros of this include living with my love <3, being close to work and my love (so I don't have to drive back and forth between Costa Mesa and Cypress all the time), and being free to do what I want because my mom won't be around. The cons include moving my stuff (because I hate moving...it is a pain in the butt), worrying about money, barely ever seeing my mom or my pets, and having to drive out to <em>stinkin</em> Palm <em>stinkin</em> Springs every weekend (because my mom is making me). So I'm kinda confused about my feelings on the subject. There are about the same amount of pros and cons. Or maybe not. I don't know yet. This is too much change in a short amount of time for me..."

"event","I got back from the trip to the lake today. It feels funny for some reason to be back at home. I feel like I should be roasting marshmallows to make smores right now or something.  I had smores for the first time on the trip and now I'm addicted. Hehe. I had a lot of fun at the lake. It started a little rough for David's family though. On the way there David's dad's truck broke down right outside of Valencia. David's dad and sister had to drive all the way back home to get the van while the rest of David's family waited in the broken down truck at a truck stop for several hours. So David's family didn't arrive until 3 in the morning and they were exhausted. Everything turned out ok though. The next day we went out on the boat and David and I rode the ski bob which was a lot of fun. He and his sister also went wake boarding. Every night David went fishing and he wound up catching two bass and a catfish so he was very happy. There was so much wildlife there. Every day a group of deer would come to the cabin and we would feed them. There were a lot of baby deers with their mothers. I also saw rabbits, wild boars, owls, bats, turkeys, quails, blue jays, squirrels , carp jumping out of the water, and one extremely large and scary bug. On our last day I went on the knee board on the boat. It took me a few times to get up on it while the boat was going but I got it. It was fun except that it took every bit of my strength to hold on. I really messed up my back doing it. Today when I got out of the car I could barely walk because my back hurt so badly. It still really hurts. I hope it gets better soon because I can't do much with it like this. 
So now I am home though I just found out a couple days ago that this might now be my home in a month or so. My mom may be getting a job in Palm Springs and moving out there with her boyfriend. I do not want to move there. I would never ever be able to see David and I would have to drop my whole life here. So if my mom gets this job I may be moving in with David. My mom wants me to visit her every weekend if I do so. I'm still kinda in shock and I'm not completely sure if it is going to happen but it is sure looking that way. I wish they would hurry up and tell her if she got the job. Until then I just have to wait and see..."

My new bed is supposed to be really pretty and it is bigger than the one I have now so that will be nice. The bed arrives next Saturday. As of right now there is no bed in my room so I'm staying at David's tonight. Tomorrow we leave for Lake San Antonio to go camping for the week. There is around 20 people (family and friends) going. It should be really fun."

"event","Today David and I took the kids from the day care to see Shrek 2. It was kind of a crazy experience watching so many kids in a movie theater but it was fun and the movie was pretty funny. The rest of the day got a million times crazier. David's family was fighting with the next door neighbors. There were a ton of visits from the police and lots of yelling and cursing. Poor Ralph got so upset that his blood pressure rose drastically and an ambulance was called to take him to the hospital. I hope he is ok. He was just in the hospital. I'm sure he will be but it really upset me to see him taken away in an ambulance. :'( Well it will be good for him to get away from all the chaos next week when we go to Lake San Antonio. I can't wait. On a completely different subject...I want a puppy desperately. I found one that I really wanted but I shouldn't have got my hopes up because my mom won't let me get him. Our house is too small she says. *Sigh* Shatter my dreams..."

I put a huge scratch on the side of it while trying to back out of a parking space that had two poles on either side. All the money I just earned is going to go to fixing my car now. I should just give up this driving thing. I don't know why these things seem to always happen to me."

"event","So I graduated on Thursday (June 3rd). (Yay!) My mom, dad, Michael, David, grandma, uncle Steve, Jeffrey, Aunt Rhonda, and David's parents came. We all went out to dinner at Mi Casa afterward. My grandma, uncle Steve, and aunt Rhonda each gave me a $100 for my graduation present. My grandma and grandpa Gerdes gave me $25 and David's parents gave me $50. Plus my mom got me a $100 gift certificate for Express and $25 gift certificate for Victorias Secret. It is insane. I never expected to get any money for graduation. It is too much but I'm happy. I also got some little gifts from Jeffrey and my aunt Rhonda and my dad traded me digital cameras so I have a much nicer one now. That night David and I went to see the new Harry Potter at midnight which was really good. 
Yesterday I went shopping with my gift certificate and got some new pretty skirts and a top. David and I also went to Sam Ash and David got what he wanted, a brand new guitar. It is an Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II full hollow body guitar. It is really really pretty and he is very happy."

Now that it is finally here it is almost anticlimatic. All I really have to look forward to now is more school. Ha. Plus my mom is being ridiculous right now and I have a feeling that tomorrow may not be that great and there will be some conflict. Oh well at least high school is over and summer is here. 
Today David and I went bike riding. He had Astrid pull him on a scooter at first and I had the cockatoo (still unnamed) in the basket of my bike. It was fun and she seemed to like it. People saw her and thought it was cute. They must think we are insane with our husky mushing on a scooter and a cockatoo riding in a bicycle basket. Haha.

"event","I had a pretty fun memorial day weekend. Yesterday David's family had a bbq and the whole family plus Rick's family was there. David and I played with his nieces and nephews on the floatable trampoline that Mark bought for the upcoming trip to San Antonio Lake. David also made his best efforts to annoy the racist neighbors with very loud Puerto Rican music which was quite funny. At night we went to Steamers Jazz Club in Fullerton to see Khaled play at the jam night. I really like going there. The music is really good. Now David wants to get a stand up bass. Hehe. It would be pretty cool though. 
Today David and I took Astrid to the dog beach in Huntington. First we rushed to Nick's to get breakfast burritos. They were really cool to stay open late for us to come get them. The beach was packed. I don't think I've ever seen so many people and dogs there. We tried to coax Astrid in the water but only really got her to go in all the way by herself once. The rest of time David carried her in there. It was pretty funny. David and I went swimming and there was a sea lion in the water. We got really close to it. It didn't seem to care at all. At one point though the current pushed me close and it kinda startled her. Then she came up by my leg and blew bubbles at me. It was really funny. Everybody on the beach was watching David and me swim with the sea lion. It was really neat. Too bad I didn't have my camera. 
Well now I am sitting at home pretty bored. Guess I'm going to go to bed early even though I'm not going to school tomorrow. We have nothing left to do so we're watching movies and there's not reason for me to go. 
Countdown to graduation...2 more days :)"

It is great. I'm done with all my work in all my other classes too so school is pretty pointless right now. Next week is going to consist of a day off, a day of nothingness, a day of practicing the graduation ceremony, then finally my graduation day. It seems too good to be true. It is so close...yet so far away. I'm so impatient. Harper keeps saying that once we are gone we are going to miss it but I know that I am not going to. This has been the worst year of my life with Kelli's death and school only reminds me of it every day because I used to see her there. I will not miss that at all. I'm very ready to move on."

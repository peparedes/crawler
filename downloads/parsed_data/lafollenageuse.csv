"event","I just got done hiding like  dozen eggs of various sizes for my parents to search for tomorrow, not to mention a large, very large chocolate bunny.  I remember when I loved easter because my family was all together.  Then there was a very awkward period when no one was home and we had no new tradtions, however I have definetly fell in love with this being the easter bunny thing.  it is a beautiful role reversal to get to send your parents off to bed, then sit on the couch in the morning feeling superior.  

Oh and I am definetyly finding a new favorite in Jimmy Eat World too. 

But dude, how could this break be over already, I got nothing I wanted to done, nothing.


Oh and I have an easter kitty.  There was extra egg dye, and a pretty white kitty, now there is a pretty white kitty with a pink tipped tail...


HAPPY EASTER!!! (silly Jesus getting resurected/ silly bunnies hiding eggs)"

I talked to Mrs Hurl, my sneaky plan to take the AP test, pass it, and still get the weighted grade for first semester is going to work.  So now I need a first period class, I really want to take ceramics, but there are 36 people in the class so it is up to the teacher if he wants to take another.  As of now I am in writers workshop with Mrs Hedges, she doesn't know that though, it was just an easy place for Mrs Hurl to put me, but hey, it might be fun if no ceramics.  Or there is the thought of going back to band, I really really miss playing my flute, and if I do academic league I can't play in the san diego concert band, but it is band, and there are bad vibes for me in band.  Anyway, if any of you have any fun suggestions for my freedom, comment away!!!"

"event","Directions:
1. Put your playlist on random.
2. Pick lines from the first 25 songs that play.
3. Post and let people guess what song the lines come from.
4. Cross out the songs when someone guesses correctly. No Googling.

1) I died eight years ago, still a legend at my high school/ stole a chevy and I wrapped it round a tree/ but thats okay 'cause no ones gonna make the next century

2) Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea/ all we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

3) Now i can't forget you and it makes me mad/ left one day and never came back/ stayed one summer then went back home/ mc cully culkin (sp?) was in home alone

4)All I can do is read a book to stay awake/ and it rips my life away but its a great escape

5)<s>After 31 days of sleepless nights she woke up to end it all/ with I love you on a fresh tatoo engraved upon his chest /she took her name right off his heart so heres to the unblessed</s>

6)<s> Sometimes i walk alone at night when everybody else is sleeping/ i think of him and then i'm happy with the company i'm keeping/ the city goes to bed and i can live inside my head... </s>

7 )<s>How mnay lovers would stay. just to put up with this shit day after day/ how did we wind up this way/ watching our mouths and the words that we say</s>

8)<s>Somebody once asked could i spare some change for gas/ I need to get myself away from this place/ i said yep what a concept i could use a little fuel myslef and we could all use a little change</s>

9) I watch you there through the window and i stare that you wear nothing but you wear it so well/ tied up and twisted the way I like to be / for you for me...

10)<s> Just a little change/ small to say the least/ both a little scared/ neither quite prepared</s>

11)<s>Its the perfect time of day/ to throw all your cares away/ put the sprinkler on the lawn/ and run through with my gym shorts on /take a drink right from the hose /and change into some drier clothes</s>

12) <s>New, and a bit alarming/ who'd have ever thought that this could be/ true that hes no prince charming/ but theres something in him that i simply didn't see</s>

13)<s> I have often dreamed/ of a far off place/ where a great warm welcome will be waiting for me/ the crowds will cheer/ when they see my face/ and the voice keeps saying this is where i'm meant to be</s>

14)<s> I'm so green its really amazing/ i'm so clean too bad i can't get all the dirt off of me/ i'm so sane its driving me crazy</s>

15) You can't jump the track/ well the cars on a cable/ and lifes like an hourglass glued to the table/ no one can find the rewind but boys/ so cradle your head in your hands

16)<s> Communication/ a telephonic invasion/ sorry i'm not home right now...Its all your fault i screen my phone calls/ no matter who calls i gotta screen my phone calls</s>

17) <s>On board i'm a captin/ so climb abord/ we'll search for tomorrow on every shore/ and I'll try oh lord i'll try to carry on</s>

18) You found hope hope/ you found faith,, found how fast she could take it away, found true love, lost your heart/ now you don't know who you are

19)Cut these chains hanging around our neck/ people want to strangle us with them before we take our first breaths/ afraid of change, afraid fo staying the same/ when tempation comes we just look away

20)<s> When the train rolls by i'm gonna be ready this time/ when the boy gets the look in his eye i'm gonna be ready this time/ when my mom says I look good in white i'm gonna be ready this time</s>

21)Live in a church where you sleep with voodoo dolls/ and you won't give up the search for the ghost in the walls/ wear sandals in the snow and a smile that won't wash away/ can you look out the window with out your shadow getting in the way

22)<s> So I said i'm a snow ball running/ running down into the spring thats coming of this love/ melting under blue skies belting out sunlight shimmering love/ baby i surrender to the strawberry ice cream...</s>

23)<s> I feel drunk but i'm sober/ i'm young but i'm underpayed/ I'm tired but i'm working yeah</s>

24) The meal had gone with out a hitch/ till timmy turned to abmer and said is it true that your a witch

25)<s> J'ai tout manger the chocolate/ j'ai tout fumer les cravens As....</s>

I have done this before but it was a nice way to spend time during break, I enjoy going through my music periodically."

People swinging so far to one or the other that they arte willing to blindly hate either side of the politcal debate simply along the basis of party lines is the worst thing that could have happene dto our country.  I am so sick of seeing all these not just angry or frustrated or upset, but down right hateful posts about bush winning, or hearing all the crap from people that the republicans are ruining our country.  it is not one party or the other that is ruining our country it is the ajority of the populice that is so blinded by this hate they have found they can't see past it to the real issues.  We are too busy hating each other to look around, and I am sick of it.  every single one of you needs to get off your high horses and get over it and if youa re really that into politics start trying to fnd a way to make our country more coehisive and united, not pull it apart our of some twisted idea of a rivalry.  At risk of sounding preachier then I do already, damn it we are all Americans, and we need to start acting like it!"

"event","This is going to be one of those entries that needs a disclamer, so if you don't want to read it don't.  I need to get some stuff out about my friends and myself and my life, and guess what it is not all sunshine and light.  I firmly beleive it is impossible for any one to be genuinely happy all the time and be aware of the world around them, if there is anyone out there who thinks other wise they I beleive they must be lying to them selves.  So like I said if that little statememnt bothered you in anyway quit reading right no it is not going to get better for you.

These are my opinions and my opinions only, please keep that in mind too if you continue reading.  So here's my first thing, I am so incredibly sick of seminar students.  I have discovered in them (and in myself) perhaps what I would call the worst form of non violent prejudice out there, elitism.  I know we have all been blessed with gifts, but that is just it they are a blessing not a god given right and just because we have been in a ""special"" room for way too much of our schooling does not make us any better then anyone else on campus.  Everytime I hear someone complain about the counselors going over how to get into Mesa, because they feel like it is below them it makes me so angry.  Just because soemones plan is to go to Mesa, or even their only option is to go to Mesa does not mean that they are in anyway inferior to you if you are applying to Ivy leagues. 

Maybe I have just come to grips with this horrible thing that is so rampant amognst me and my peers because I have felt so victimised by it recently.  I don't even want to work on my college stuff in the seminar room because I know there are those in that room who if they saw me finalinzing applications for UCSB would look down on me, and if they saw me working on my Yale App, would feel I was wasting my time.  These are not always the same people but they are the same stupid judgements that for some reason are so much more prevalent in seminar.  I have found myself doing this too though, I was so supset with the discovery I was not top 10 in the class.  And then as I heard my friends today urging the sabatoge of another student (given of course that she herself is way too caught up in this herself) I realised what a prissy spoiled little girl I must have seemed, and for most people that is probably how I am viewed.  I hate that facet of myself as much as I hate seeing it in my friends, and I am trying as of a couple hours ago to rid myself of it completely.  

I have a different attitude on class rankings and such from my swim training. When I got into high shcool I made in my goal to be top 10, that is why I was so upset to hear I failed in acheiving my goal.  I didn't realise that being top ten means pushing someone who might very well have worked harder and deserve it more then you out of the position.  In swimming if you make your goal it doesn't affect anyone else in the way that a competition like that of class rank does. Now that I realise that I also realize I don't deserve the rank I have now, I haven't worked on it the way others out there have, it has been given to me.  It is simply a manifestation of my blessing as it were.

The other thing besides the horrible side of my self and my best friend that has been bugging the crap out of me, is yet again my tendancy to be hated.  SOme of you know this and soem of you don't but when your swim team, your best friends in the worlde who you have suffered through blood sweat and tears with suddenly tell you essentially that they think you are a mean, rotten and generally horrible  and they don't want you on thier team anymore doesnot really make for the best week.  So I'm sorry if I have been upset, and I am sorry if maybe I snapped but that is the other thing.  PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE BAD DAYS.

If one of your friends is upset for some reasona nd you don't know why, and you don't try to at least find out where they are coming from instead you just push at them like you normally would and they snap.  I firmly belive that this is not their fault, it is your own friggin fault for not caring enough to possibly bring your mood down by trying to help out a freind.It is the worst thing you could possibly do to soemone who is obviously upset.  I hate it, absolutely hate it when I see anyone do this to anyone.  If you are having a great day and your friend is not for what ever reason.  it will not take that much out of you to try and hlep them out rather then jsut going on with your happy go lucky day as if their unhappyness is some sort of inconvenice to you.  

I believe that true friends are those that care about you no matter how you are feeling.  Especially if they are willing to actually perhpas sacrifice a little bit of thier great day to try and make yours a little better.  Friends who are only friend with you when you are happy are not friends at all.  By that defiention I discovered today that I have two and a half true friends."

Somebody thought of that and someone beleieved it, look whats it done so far

So as of now my classes are looking good, we will see how crazy things get in the next couple of weeks and they might change around again.  But for now this is how it is looking for me:
1) AP Psycology  Silliphant (sp)
2) AP Pysics  Benz
3) AP English   Hedges (duh)
4) Poli Sci    Some guy i don't know yet
5) Calculus    Cool lady, don't know her name yet
6) AP Environmental  Some guy i don't know yet

See, but I also need to swim 9 practice a week and teach 4 swim lessons.  So we will see how long this lasts this way.  I can change it all easy, I already talked to Mrs Hurl about that, but she wants me to try it.  In a way I am kinda excited.  It means I could get a 5.0 this semester, esp with out a french class!  That would be pretty spiffy I think.  I mean I can always blow off poli sci, right?"

But soon, way to soon school will snatch it all away again.  Sigh.  But at least I had this week right, and it has been great and it is not over yet, no surrie (sp?) not by a long shot.  

In light of my previous post, I have made a decision about what I want to do with this year.  Luckily I have some really good friends to talk to.  I am going to keep swimming but I am not going to let it rule my life like it has in the past.  If I want to stay up late, or go out with my friends or what ever I will do it regardless of practice in the morning or not.  I am going to find a balance.  And I am not going to let others push me away from it, not my coach, not my parents, not my teachers, not my friends.  I am going to try to walk the line, and I think I can do it.  To all of you this just means I will have much more free time, to my coach, well we will see, but to me, I am hoping it will mean a greater amount of balance in my life.

Yay, random post done!


Oh and I got  new swim suit today!!!  Too bad it is the end of the summer and thus I will stay super pale."

"event","I really don't know what to do with myself for the next couple of months.  I suppose everything will settle in with the required settling force of school, but there are too many choices to be made even regarding that.  I really don't like the way that my schedule is looking at this point.  I don't think i want to take ceramics cause i don't think I will have any friends there.  And I know I don't want to be in AP pysics, but i do have friends there who want me to stay.  I know in the first couple of weeks lots of things are going to change around but the other activities I would switch myself into require more of my time then the current level of swimming will allow.  This time last year that was not a difficult decision, it was swimming all the way.  But that was coming off an awesome season where my team really bonded and I had great things to look forward too.  Now unfortunatly things are quite different for me.  Last season I accomplished everything I had planned out of this year, and to make the jump to the next level is huge, like way huge, and I'm not sure if it is worth it any more.  I want to have fun in my senior year and swimming just hasn't been fun recently, especially with Summer and Allegra gone, and I get to see Leeanne at school the only person who would be prematurely dropping from my life is emily.  I am not talking about quitting, goodness not now, but maybe backing off a little.  I am not sure if I am swimming for my goals or my coaches goals for me any more.  We are going to have a senior team, four swimmers, not just me so I know things are going to change, but I don't know how much.  I will still be the only veteran to the types of competition and things but at least there will be others going through it with me.  The only real reason for me to keep up with the level of training I have been at would be to swim for college, but I am not even sure i want to do that anymore.  I want to study abroad, and take accelerated course tracks and things in college, things they won 't let you do if you are on athletic scholarship.  I know swimming isn't going to take me to the great places college swimming is supposed to, there is no Olympics in my future.  For goodness sake I acheived my highest long term goal that I set when I started this summer.  I never even expected to have to make these types of decisions.   If I back off it could lead for so many more opportunities for me to do things, but it is so much for me to leave behind, even in that small manor.  Right now I am on the only real break we get from swim a year, and I am supposed to forget about it completely, but there are decisions I need to make regarding it that are forcing me to dwell.  As silly as it sounds after that whole bit, I hate dwelling"

"event","So here's the deal.  I am visiting a friend in San Francisco and I miss the water like crazy.  So in an attempt to find some pool time I am going to go to her high school boys polo practice in the morning.  I am a swimmer, not a polo player, andf I am a girl.  I am excited, yet scared.  I hope all goes weel.  On another not I got a personal guided tour of Standford today and that was awesome.  I have cemented in my head though that I am way not cool enough to go to any of the schools I have been thinking abou tand it is time for me to start looking into a few more reasonable places like State, and UCSB.  God I wish I had done something worth wild, or been just a bit smarter, but now I am afraid it is too late and I must spend my time of college repenting in hopes of things changing for grad school."

"event","So I am visiting up here, and its been fun.  Monterey Bay Aquarium yesterday was super super cool.  It reminded me why I wanted to be a marien biologist for so long.  We have a tour of stanford planed on wednesday with one of her friends who is going to be a senior there next month.  So not much has been going on, i am starting to get excited about school.  I look forward to seeing everybody every day again.  Senior year is going to be fun, and sad, but super fun."

"event","Zones was really fun, quite a different birthday for me then usual but still definetly worth wild.  We left on Monday, met the team at the airport and flew to sacromento, then piled into a bus to drive for another 2.5 hours to Redding which is basically in Oregon.  We had a nice view of Mt Shasta from the pool, and when we were driving around.  We went to the pool to practice on monday afternoon then the meet started on Tuesday.  I swam the mile on my birthday on the first day of the meet, that didn't go so well, but after I was done my team had the announcer anounce that it was my birthday and that was pretty cool.  I swam the 200 breaststroke on wendesday, it was my extra event which I didn't acttually have the cut in, so I was seeded dead last.  But I dropped alot of time, like 6 seconds, made the cut by like 3, and placed 12 of 24, so I was really happy with my swimming that day.  Thursday was the 400 IM which I was seeded to final in, but I added a couple of seconds and came in like 11th.  Friday was my big day I swam the 200 fly and the 400 free.  I was seeded to final in both of them.  I dropped 2 seconds in prelims in the butterfly, but added time to my freestyle, so I just made finals in the fly.  In finals i dropped 2 more seconds and came in fourth, so that was super awesome.  Then Saturday the last day of the meet I swam the 800 free, I swam right next to a girl I met at swim camp earlier in the summer, so I had extra motivation.  I drafted off her for the first 300, then passed her and beat her, I also dropped five seconds but the coolest part about that race was that I came in 2nd in my age group!  I also swam in both the 400 and 200 freestyle relays, and both of those took 2nd.  I got booted from the medleys because of my inability to sprint, but it was nice I got some afternoons off, even nicer concidering it was like 105 and 20 % humidity the entire time.

All in all, I had a really good time and made alot of new friends, all really fast swimmers.  As a team we came in 4th which is the highest place for San Diego in 20 years.  If you want to go look a web site, I think it was www.swimconnection.org  or mabye com, was posting results and articles and stuff about the meet, you cans ee if it is still there.  It was a big thing for redding we were on the local news every night we were there!

I am so glad I went, though by the end of it I was pretty sick of people.  A couple of days and i can look back on it with a clearer head and know that I had an absolutely wonderful time, and now I leave for San Franciso day after tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","I was just finishing the dishes and that song came in my head.  I love it, one of the best songs for me to swim to, and just generally fun.  Then I went up to my room and on my computer found the lyrics in one of my friends profiles that I haven't talked to much recently.  I guess it proves some connections can never really be severed.

Now for something a little less existential.  JOs went well. I came in 2nd in the mile, every one says I could have won it, but my goggles came off on the last couple hundred and I couldn't see the girl anymore, I really have to be able to see my competition if I am going to catch them from behind.  But I am very happy with the second.  I also came in 5th in the 800, and made my first final in the 400, coming in 8th.  I swam six events finaled in half of them, and scored in two of the other three.  Our team got its first team trophy, 8th place!  When competeing with teams about 10 times your size, 8th of 20 something it super exciting.   Now JOs and Sectionals are done, but I am not.  One more meet.  I offically made the Zones team so I will be representing San Diego Imperial in the Western Zones swim meet in Redding California from the 9th to the 16th.  Which means for the first time in my life I will be away from my family on my birthday. I am turning 17 in 8 days!!! On that note, I got my present from  my brother today.  He is in the Phillipeans so I read the coustomes note attached to the front, so because I knew what was in it I just had to open it.  And I am now in posession of the DVDs of King Arthur, Along Came Polly, Hidalgo, and Alex and Emma.  Proving once more it pays to have siblings over seas.  And a shirt that says Rice is Life in big letters, since he is working at the Rice institute.  Today was a big day of deliveries, I also got my senior pictures.  I really don't know who they are of, cause it sure isn't me, but let me know if you want one, my mom got a bizillion wallets.  I saved a place in one of my photo albums for senior pictures o fmy friends, so I can look back one day and see how nice y'all looked.  

Off to practice once more, so bed time now.   Goodnight all!"

I was gaurding, and it was really hot, and then I started seeing spots but I couldn't figure out why, then some blackness around my perifrial vision with and accompaning roaring in my ears which grew steadily worse until I came seconds away from passing out.  Luckily I had gotten the attention of one of the other gaurds and sat down away from the pool, or I probably would have passed out completely.  Yeah that was fun.  Lesson learned, don't lock your knees when you stand for extended periods of time."

"event","I had a good time with weekend.  And have retourned triumphantly from my first national championship level meet.  Here's the low down if you are interested...

Nancy decided last minute that she was going to come up too, so she and Coach drove together saving me from the 6 hours of steely silence I was expecting.  It was weird having her there in like ""the coach's wife"" role, rather then a parent, but I guess I should get used to it since they are supposed to be getting married some time this summer.  Because she was there we didn't spend that much time together, the four of us, and I am sure it was better that way.  Coach and Dad got along fine, Dad and I got along fine to so all was well in that department.

I swam the 800, on thursday, and of course it was the last event of the day so I swam around 2.  Just to be spiffy, Frezno was having its hottest week in a long time, so I managed to stay about 106 the entire time we were there.  But I must admit I did adjust to it pretty well after a couple of days  and was actually rather chilly today back at home.  Anyway so I dropped 9 seconds in the 800, yay! But I didn't make the long course sectional time, Boo.  I was entered in all my events with my short course times because they are significantly faster then my long course ones.  It wasn't a big deal, we asked and they weren't even really worried about verifying my time.

Friday I had a  day off from swimming so we went early and I warmed up, swam basically the morning practice everyone else had to do at home.  Then we split up and dad and I went to Kings Canyon national park.  We had a really good time and we have some fun strories but they are better told then typed so you will have to hear them later.  We saw some really big trees and I went in my first cave, basically we just drove around and got distracted by things we thought were cool.

Saturday I swam the 400, same as the 800 last event so late in the day.  I was seeded dead last, because it was my bonus event, so I didn't really have the time in either course, so we figured I could only do better.  I was pacing really well in the morning, and I dropped 5 seconds in the afternoon, but was still like 10 seconds off what I had been pacing, and coach, though happy with the improvement, told me I could do better and got all quiet contemplating what he could do to insure that.  And I bettered my seed by a significant amount I came in 117 of 125!!!  I was very excited about that.

The mile on sunday went much the same way as the 400, great pacing, 3 second improvement in time, and grumpy coach and kinda grumpy me, because we both know I can swim faster then that.  I am still like 20 seconds off my converted time.  But still three personal best times, and I wasn't even tapered, can't really complain too much.

I am really glad I went, I realized that the competition there really isn't that scary, even though there were a bunch of college swimmers.  The scariest thing there were the pace lanes in the morning though, on saturday morning I some how got stuck in the middle of one of the mens college teams doing the pace work.  It was so scary.  The average age of girls was between 15 and 20, but the guys were 17 to 22, all big and scary, pretty too, but swimming with them was nuts.

Next year we will have a team, not just me, and we will be so speedy, no one will even see us swim, we will move too fast.  JOs starts on thursday with the mile so I have another chance at all those races, not to mention the relays and the 400 IM, and the 100 and 20 Butterfly.  W had the Pre- JO speach today and I am way psyched up for the meet.

This is what I do, I swim."

"event","So this has been a long week.  I started work, I tried to play frisbee golf, I swam my butt off, and to cap it all off I swam a meet.  The meet went relativily well, four for four best times, but not in events I am really worried about, but its still good.  

I am dreading Sectionals.  My dad reminded me today why spending five days just him and me at a swim meet was going to be hell, with a half hour long lecture about not doing what I am asked, which is one of his usual rants, but he took it a step further to say that is why I am having so many problems with my friends this summer.  They don't actually want to be around me cause I am such a horrible person for forgetting to do one thing for him.   It makes it alot harder to be socialable at meets when you show up in tears.

I have been freaking out about this meet for so long now.  I really feel like swimming senior this summer, and going to sectionals and all has isolated me from the team.  And it sucks.  I am so scared about this, I can very rarely even find a reason for me to go, but if i turn to anyone on the team about my apprehensions, they just won't hear me cause they are too upset about not making their times or something.  And I can't talk to anyone outside of swimming cause they just don't understand what it would be like in the first place to be getting stress stomach aches, weeks before a swim meet.  I guess I never thought the slight differences in practice schedule would change my relationships so much. What with everyo9ne telling me I am coach's ""golden child"" or giving me crap about how i better not get used to my ""special treatment"" cause next year things are going to change.  At this point a huge part of me wishes I had never even done this.  I dread my afternoons, I miss my friends, and where has it gotten me, to a meet I don't even want to go to.  

I just wish this summer could be more like last"

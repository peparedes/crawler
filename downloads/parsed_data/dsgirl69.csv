"event","I got my wedding gown in layaway its from davids bridal. My fiance Darris n I picked one out sunday and the next day my mom came in to put it in layaway seen it n didnt like it. I ended up trying 5 more dresses on before I found the perfect dress. AND ITS A SIZE 4 WhOo HOoo... 

It looks 100% better then the one Darris liked. It's strapless n the top is sequence with pearls and A- line cut with silky material n the trim on the bottom is same as top all the way around with a lil train and buttons from back to end of train :-)It's really pretty and was on clearence for $300. 

It's a lot of work planing a wedding. I have been calling places for reception site n all that stuff. It's hard. Were getting married when he comes back from the boot camp. He is joining the ARMY maybe in November. The wedding all depends on when he get's his two week break. That is hard too since every where u call asks for a date. 

I am very tired, Darris had a job interview at JCpenny starting at 7.10 an hr stocking 6am-11am. HE IS NOT A MORNING PERSON AT ALL. I went with him and got some earings that are diamonds n pearls to match my dress. I hate pearls but the dress n earings look great."

"event","Darris and I are goin tomorrow. We are goin just us. My brother Ryan backed out of goin. So this will be cool though. We will have fun. I have never went to MI AD. Before... He has 3 times. The last time wtih his GIRLFRIEND at the time. Some nasty anorexic slutty whore... Trust me she was one. 32 partners and she was only 19??? Jesus...I guess she cheated on him and she brought the guy with them and Darris thought everything would be ok. Wasn't they broke up or something. W.E WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL I will write n tell u wut happend. Some rides I might not wanna go on. So hopefully Darris wont be mad at me since he will be by himself... It's more like a water park though.
  FUn Fun Fun."

"event","ok so i decided to make an enry here b/c i can. so it's almost the end of the semester and i am going nuts!!!! so i have a lot of assignents but nothing i can't handle. i'm doing some christams shows withthe PRT we are doing them at the JCC. i can never say that w/o a smile on my face. so i am busy like usualy. but not too bad. i am going up north for christmas, i leave the 15th od december and get back the 1st of january. i think my mother is nuts. i was like you do realize that's like 2 whole weeks witht the family. i love my family i do. but ALL of us have not stayed in the whole house for that long ever to my recolection. this is going to be very scary. go christmas. anyway halloween was fine. i had a production meeting so could not go to the carnival at UCF. the only problem with theater is it always interfers with other stuff i want to do. but at least i am not doing an insane amount of shows. and the show at the JCC ends the 2nd. i am SMing the whole thing and acting inone. it should be fun. i'm going to the movies tomorrow with laura and Jenn go us! and i have a paper due on monday yea! so i have a month of classes and then freedom, of sorts. my schedule for next semester sucks. and i really hope i did'n tmake a mistake becoming a double major. i just need to last till may 08. god. then grad school unless i decide to take a break. who knows i am very indesicive. anyway that's all i guess. i am almost done with my christmas shopping. makes me feel alll grown up!"

You rank up there with your seduction skills, though you might not know it.
That's because you're a natural at seduction. You don't realize your power!
The root of your natural seduction power: your innocence and optimism.

You're the type of person who happily plays around and creates a unique little world.
Little do you know that your personal paradise is so appealing that it sucks people in.
You find joy in everything - so is it any surprise that people find joy in you?

You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>"

If you are in town we open next friday oct. 7th. friday and saturday are 7:30 curtain sunday is 2pm. we run for two weeks. please come see it. school has not improved, if anything it is worse. i am about to turn in the worst paper i have ever written, which is worth 10 percent of my grade. YES! no matter how hard i try i feel like i am sinking. my mom thinks the pay is interfering, but it's not. i have been involved in a play every semester i've been in college sometimes more then one. it has never effected my grades before. the atmosphere at ucf is much differetn from what i am used to i think it will take a wile to adjust. of course it is almost october, how much adjust could i possibily need. but we have tech on saturday which i am really excited. i like techs. how sick is that! so we will see."

One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm, a mother was tucking her small boy into bed. She

was about to turn off the light when he asked with a tremor in his voice, ""Mommy, will you sleep 
with me tonight?""

The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. ""I can't dear,"" she said. ""I have to sleep in

"event","i saw Mr. and Mrs. Smith last night with Jessica and John. it was very cool. we had a great time. and i bought Little women the musical, which rocks!
lately though i've been feeling really lonely. i can't really explain it. But i hate when things are going great, and you know it won't last, and then the shit hits the fan and everything falls apart. i just have'nt been myself lately, and i don't know what to do. i really don't. all i want to do is cry and nothing is going right, and i'm just tired. tired of everthing. tired of being sad, tired of being lonley, and tired of being angry. i felt a little better after last night. but i'm just lost, which is'nt odd i'm always lost, but thins is the different kind of lost. i'll figure it out eventually i guess.

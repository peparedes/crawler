Last week was my first week and I am really enjoying it, I love taking care of other people's teeth!!! Also my schedule is fantastic, it's Tuesday and Wednesday 8-5 and Thursday and Friday 7-4 and no weekends!!! Well that's the only thing exciting in my life so I will go now.. hope you are all doing good. If your ever in the Greeley area give me a call.... Have a good Day!

"event","This has been a really good week for me! Last week I got a call from this job I had applied for months ago and never heard from. I went in for an interview last week and they offered me the job, which is totally an answer to prayer. So as of next monday I am officailly a dental assistant at comfort dental. Which means when you first come into the dentist I am the person who cleans your teeth and flosses them, also I get to learn to take xrays and make molds. It is gunna be the coolest job ever!!! I am so excited!!!! Also I will no longer have to work nights, the latest I will ever have to work is 7:30 and one Saturday a month from 7:30- 1:30. I am sad to leave my job now as a nanny but it is killing me to have to work till midnight everynight. So that is my exciting news. And now hopefully with better work hours I can come visit you all sometime... who knows. Well I gotta run... time for work! \

"event","Hi... it has been a really long time again since I have posted so I thought I would seeming I have an hour before I go off to work. I no longer work at Bed, Bath and Beyond, I am now a childrens spanish teacher during the day and a nanny at night. I really like both of my jobs... the only down side to the nanny job is I work till 11:30 at night monday thru Friday, but I do have weekends off, so that is really nice. Other than that my life is pretty boring, I did break up with my boy though..... some times you just gotta do what you have to do. I just didnt feel right dating him, he was a really nice guy, but after alot of thinking I know I am just not ready for the dating scene yet. Oh well.. I feel really good about my decison on that matter anyways. Well I miss you all.. and if you guys could do me a huge favor i dropped my phone in my dogs water dish a few days ago and my phone died, so I have lost everyones phone numbers, so that would be totally awsome if you could text me or call me so I can stay in contact with you guys. Its been a rough year for me and phones that is the second one I have lost to water. Well I gotta run things to do. Talk to you later

"event","I figure since I have not been around lately I would just pop in and say hi and let everyone know what has been going on. I still work a whole lot!!! I have been working all night shifts since I am going to school during the day, but luckily school is over in 1 week!!! I am so excited! Other than that not much is going on... I have a boyfriend now, his name is Matt. He's a really neat guy! So that is really exciting... I am still living with Kelly and I absolutely love it! We have such a good time together.  Well I hope to come to church sometime in the near future.... providing I get a night off! Other than that my life is pretty much the same, go to work, go home, play with my pug. Well its been great talking to you all,but I gotta run I have to study for finals=(

"event","Life is so crazy right now... life just seems to be spinning out of control. It seems like everytime I start to get a grip or a handle on how to make my life better it gets 10 times worse! I am stressed out and ready to throw in the towel...can't anything just be simple! I have gotten into so many bad habits latly and it is so hard to reverse them. I feel like I am going in circles..... I am frusterated with God and it seems like there is no where else to turn. My friends here in town are not to much help half of them help with continue with my bad habits and then other half try to guilt me into get me back on track with God. I know they have good intentions but I had when they try to make me feel bad about it. And yes I relize that if I feel bad about it then I shouldnt be doing it, and I know this isnt an excuse but it is so easy just to go with the crowd and try to fit in. I wish I had some really good friends down here in Greeley. Well now I am going to stop talking about my problems and just go to bed i have to be at work early tomorrow. thanks for listening everyone, hopefully i will see you all soon. My car is fixed now so I can drive again! Good night!"

"event","I am so frustrated right now! There is this person who has always been in my life since I was 10 or so and tonite we got into the biggest fight.... the words that were said from the other person were so hurtful and just plain mean! Right now I feel so betrayed I have always stood up for this person and always believed in them even when no one else did. And now tonite I am told by them the only reason we hang out is because they have nothing better to do. Ouch that hurt! It makes me want to cry! NOw I  don't know what to do.... Why does life always have to be so complicated!!! On a side note if any of you think about it will you pray for me, tonite in light of all that has happened I realized I have really let my relationship with God slip, and I am heading down a path I don't want to take. Well thanks everyone for listening to my ramblings... it is late I am going to bed! Hopefully I will see some of you at the rockies game monday or even sunday morning (if I don't get called to work!?)

Good Night!

"event","I haven't posted anything in a while so I figured I would! In short version this is what has been going on in my life..... so at work I was promoted to front end supervisor, which is so awesome, it is a lot to learn but I think I will get it! Today at work I folded towels for 8 hours straight!!!! Want to talk about mind numbing work!!!Then I came home and had and advising appointment at Aims community college (since I am transferring there in May for summer classes). The appointment did not go so well, the major I have chosen to go into has a waiting list until 2009!!!!! I don't want to wait until then to start school, so I am back to square one... and have to choose a new major! So for the summer I am going to take general classes, like math, english, intro to sociology and cultural anthropology. I am still bummed about that!!! On a good note though, I am done with spring semester of school officially!!!!! That is exciting!"

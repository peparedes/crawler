"event","ok well i don't really feel like updating but i will i guess; monday i went to hankey farms which was very fun, nadia, beth, randy, ryan, missy, kristen, alex and derek were the people i hung out with.. there are pictures in the entry before this of that.. well i came home.. and then beth came over and we went outside and played basketball, then we came in.. i don't know what we did? then yesterday.. i just hung out here all day. but later i went to missys house and her and beth got ready and and yeah.. then we went to the movies which were ok.. not that fun. but again ok. i came home, washed my face, teeth, the usual.. went on the computer and then went to bed.then today i woke up at about 10:00 and got ready for kickboxing. pink and green! haha i looked like fruit or something.. i was like 10 minutes late because my pool got a huge leak in it and i had to help my dad fix it..we didn't stay in kickboxing, only like a half hour-- me, mikele, and jessie walked around the school looking for an open bathroom for like 25 minutes!! so there was no sense going back up for 5 minutes.... so we just walked around a little more and climbed the bleechers.. yes we were bored!! practice was actually pretty fun.. me, selena, and jessie were working on these really cool turns just for fun. ALMOST THERE! well of course we cheered and danced.. and thats about it. well i don't know what i am doing the rest of today..comment? tomorrow- probaly wavepool. then practice.

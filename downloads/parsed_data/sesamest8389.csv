"event","I am so bored at the moment. There are actually tons of things that I could/should be doing, but instead I'm procrastinating the inevitable. Story of my life, I know. 
I got this amazing house in Huntington for next year. It's big and old and has Lauren N. Groseclose painted all over it's beautiful high ceilings and walls. I'm putting a lot of effort into this house, it's going to be my home for at least 3-4 years. There are some major issues that kind of remind of the Money Pit. Great movie for those of you who have not seen it. Anyways, it's a little overwhelming, but hopefully in the long run it will have all been worth the effort. 
This year school was a blast. I've never had more fun in my life and I'm not sure what or who to the credit to for all my new found happiness. I think it was a combination of being single for once, and not having to deal with anyone else's crap but my own. I've been having a lot of me time. What is me time you ask? Well it's the best time ever. I'm working on becoming a better me. Fixing my flaws and really digging deep to see what I can achieve.
In other news, I acquired some new kittens seeing how mine were viciously stolen from me. They really weren't, I just like being dramatic. But my new kittens are so awesome. They make life very interesting.
I'm still working at Chili's. Oh what fun. And I got a second job at New York and Company. I really hate working in a clothing store, but I get discounts and I love their clothes. Pretty much my summer has been devoted to work, school, and fixing up this house. I've had some fun nights here and there but this summer is all about working and getting my life together. 
I'm pretty sure I covered everything remotely interesting that has been going on in my life. 
Stay tuned for a new update sometime within the upcoming year."

I quit my job at Kroger and am now working at Chili's :o) I make so much more money there than I ever had at Kroger so yeaaa for that.
I moved... Again, but this time I believe it's permanently. 
School is almost out, thank God. It's been a rough semester. I've done really well and hope my GPA is up like it was in high school.
I am such a procrastinator it's not even funny. I have so much homework to do but no. I haven't done it yet. I'm instead online, messing around grrrrrr I hate it when I do this. Oh well being tired tomorrow will be my punishment.
Joey and I have been doing amazingly. No fighting, no major arguments. It has been smooth sailing since Thanksgiving, which is a good thing considering we're getting married. We finally picked a date: August 6th. It's in between our birthdays :o) I love him and can't wait to start our life together.
Other than that nothing new has happened.
Now I'm going to do my homework. FOR REAL.

School is back in session. Hmmmmm, this semester is going to really test my will power and strength as a student. It's amazing how much people expect outof college students. I wish I didn't have to work, but I do so I'll adjust.

Christmas break was AMAZING! I spent every single minute with Joey. It was a great time for our relationship to grow, and it soooo did lol. Things have never been better between us, and for once I'm being so honest. We haven't fought in weeks. It's been heavenly, let me tell ya :o)

"event","I do a lot of it. Mostly in the shower. I absolutely hate to do it in front of other people. There are the very rare occasions when I can't make it to a shower in time and it just comes out. I'm so tired of myself. I want to be an amazing person. I want people to look up to me. I'm such a failure, and no one even realizes it. That's what makes it unbearable. Everyone around you thinks you're so great, but deep down you know the truth.....

Thanksgiving was a very confusing time for me. I'm very unsure about what's going on. I don't know what I want anymore. I had a great time, don't get me wrong, but I have a problem with communicating.
 All I can say is that I am really considering selling all my possessions and moving far away where no one knows me. Wouldn't that be amazing? Starting over somewhere fresh. No one knows anything about you. I dream about this every night. 

This is just me being emo, but I'm tired. I'm tired of people's crap, and I' tired of the world we live in. I want great things for myself and my family and friends, but they don't seem to want the same things I do.
It is so hard to make myself do the little things in life. I'm serious, I think there is something wrong with me. For example, brushing your teeth. I had to literally role myself into the floor one day just to make myself go to the bathroom and brush my teeth. This, to me, is sick. It's the same thing with painting my nails and plucking my eyebrows. I know it needs to be done, but I just don't do it. And then this whole not doing something thing seems to be edging it's way into my school work. It definitely doesn't help that my mediocre work always seems to slide by. Like the last minute paper I write is good enough for most professors. I know it's wrong, but a part of my brain says oh well.

I have my Spanish final tomorrow. Good gracious won't that be fun.

I just wish things in life were real. Not real as in they exist, but real as in true. I want love that is 100% real. No flaws, no lies, just honest, fun love. I want family that is always there for me and who lifts me up instead of down. I want my sorority to inspire me like it used to.

Maybe it's just me. I think it is just me. I'm terrible."

I'm only bitching because a friend of his who he has only known for about let's say 2 months, is getting more or as much attention as he gives me, his fiance.

"event","I think I'm starting to hate myself. I don't know who I am anymore. I used to be smart, strong, sexy, funny, and blah blah blah. That's how I used to feel about myself. But recently things have been going downhill. This problem stems from my fiance, Joey. Every single girl that Joey talks to he has some sort of history with. Okay, not every girl, but quite a few. He has made a new friend in El Paso, and her name is Alex. She's such an amazing person blah blah blah....Joey thinks she's the shit blah blah blah. I feel so inferior to her because one: she is in El Paso with him and two: Joey thinks so highly of her. She's into motorcycles which apparently gives every man on Earth an erection when they hear that. Joey wants to get a bike and you know what I think I'm going to let him. If he doesn't respect my reason for not liking them or wanting to have anything to do with them then fine. It's his life and future, not mine.
The whole point is that Joey made a new friend who just so happens to be a girl. This would be really great news if Joey could understand that friends don't, or shouldn't in my eyes, talk to each other more than he and I speak. It frustrates the living hell out of me. I'm so tired of it, but I'm trying to be a good girlfriend/fiance and not say a damn word about it. I love him to death, but this really hurts me. I can't even talk about it to him because he gets so mad at me. Like, oh is it so unreasonable to want to know why he talks more to her? Like every night. When we're on webcam and playing games, he's also talking to her, and probably more people(girls in particular). I don't know how to make him feel like I do. How can I show him what it feels like to be turned away from and lied to? I'm working on that. For Thanksgiving I'm going to Texas to see him. 26 hours of driving omg. I want to meet the said Alex. Just so I know that she knows that I actually do exist and am an important part of his life. I can't even look at hs phone bill anymore because every time I see that she called him I get mad. And worse than that is seeing every time that he's called her back. He doesn't even call me for crying out loud!!!! 
One part of me doesn't really care. Honestly, I don't because he won't even be in El Paso for that much longer. I'm going out there the 26th of November. Then around the 20th of December he comes home for Christmas. Then it's just a countdown until I go to stay with him for the summer. After that it's deployment time for him for a year, possibly more or less(Please pray for less and for Joey to be kept safe, thanks). By that time I should be almost finished with school(omg I can't wait!) and planning on moving with him where ever he is. I just can't deal with the fact that he couldn't even tell me that he met a girl and became friends with her. If that's all it is, then why wouldn't he want to tell me? If not to just let me know, then to make sure I don't worry or anything. I think this whole post is so random lol I just needed to write this stuff down. I hope everyone is well :o)

Ok well I'll start with this. I get really confused about what's going on with us and getting married. I need time to prepare for this. I need a date. I want to just go to the courthouse and get it done. Neither of us, or our families, have the type of money needed to have a semi-decent wedding. Not that I'd even want my family to help, but it's just not an option right now. So why not just do it now? Save up money, make things easier and better on both of us. And then later on we can have a beautiful well deserved ceremony for ourselves. That's what I want to do. He won't even bring it up. I refuse to. I guess it just won't get talked about. Great. 
I'm really excited for our future together, but there has to be some sort of starting point. I'd like to know where that starting point is. 

That's about it for now."

"event","Hmmmm, where to begin. Well classes are going well. Seriously all A's except in Biology. I just cannot get up for that class. Really, it's hard. Maybe it's a sign that I'm not made for science. Or maybe it's a sign that morning classes are not for me. Who knows. I just know that next semester I will not be having any early classes lol, not one! 
Work is work. It's a job I guess. Kroger is not a very inspiring place though. I usually try and take note cards in with me to study. I'm not getting close to anyone there. That always seems to put me in a bad place. I get attached and people usually abuse that. Like asking me to work when I shouldn't and stuff like that. I actually got called in today grrrr. I'm not too happy about that.
Sorority, well what can I say about that lol. I love it, it's tiring, but so worth it. I've been trying to keep in touch with my other friends though. Summer and I usually try and workout a couple of times a week. Cory and I went to one of her camping parties last Friday. It was a lot of fun, the most fun I've had in a long time :o)
And then there's Joey. Ahhh, what can be said that hasn't already? Love him, want to be with him forever, blah blah blah. That's how he makes our relationship seem, like it's just there because it can be. I do so much for him, or at least I like to think I do. I just wish more came back to me. The thing I want most is to be able to satisfy him 100%. Not sexually, lol, I'm very confident there. I mean in other ways. He always has to turn to other people, instead of turning to me :o( He makes me feel inferior to these other girls. It's like all they have to do is be there to get his attention, and I have to work for it. I don't know, it's just how he is but it scares me. Marriage is not something to take lightly, at least not to me it isn't. I don't think he's proud of me, almost like he's embarrassed of me. he can't be completely open with our relationship like he was with Nicole, and that's one of the things that attracted me to him in the first place. I love him so much, I just wish I made him happy. 
Along with that I'm really trying to workout as much as I can. Maybe if I was as pretty as these other girls he'd finally want to show me off and actually be content :o/ Who knows? I'm not doing it just for him though, I'm just tired of being fat.......
Well I guess that sums up everything that has been happening lol
I hope all is well with everyone :o)"

"event","Well, I'm actually going to use this thing a little more this year.

First off, college is back in action. Going by very quickly which is what I love. The sooner this year is over, the sooner I get to go stay with Joey for the summer!
But until then I have a few things to occupy me lol
Like my amazing sorority, DZ for life :o) I love my sorority sisters, they make my life so much more interesting. We're in the middle of recruitment and I'm a recruitment counselor for my sorority so I've been fairly busy lately.

Joey and I are doing fantastic. He is stationed in El Paso at the moment. I'm not too happy about that, but at least he's in this country, right? 
Our relationship has grown an incredible amount over the past few months. I've never been this happy with him. He makes my days brighter, and just my life better in general. 
He asked me to marry him! OMG so excited about that. I love him so much.

College is going well I suppose. I refuse to let myself have a semester like my last one. Oh no, not even going there. Let's just say since I have no parents to be extra hard on me, I've been doing this battle within myself type of thing. Like, oh I really want to go out tonight, I'm going to go out! Then a part of me says, well actually you have a chemistry test to study for, so maybe not such a good idea. And then I stress about missing out on the fun that everyone else will have while I'm stuck at home studying.
And this is a reason why I absolutely adore notecards. I take them with me if I really want to go out, but really need to study. So if you ever see me at a bar or frat house with notecards in my hand, don't think I'm crazy lol. I'm just trying to get the best of both worlds :o)

Well I think that's pretty much it for now. 
I'm happy and life is good for me. I hope it's good for you too!"

Well things are good, sort of. I miss my boyfriend terribly. Joey got stationed in El Paso, Texas, at Fort Bliss. That's 1,682 miles away :o( 
We have been fighting a lot recently, mostly my fault, or is it his? I haven't quite decided yet. He seems to do the things that piss me off, then I suppress the feelings of anger and sadness, but eventually they all come out like a big volcano exploding over a tiny town. Everything is demolished and the villagers have to start from scratch.
I love this kid, boy, man more than anything in the world(I haven't decided whether he is a kid, boy, or man yet?). I mean his actions say he's a kid. The way he thinks is of a boy. But his feelings toward me and his way of works are of a man. It gets very confusing at times. I just wish I could be with him. I also wish he would treat me like I treat him. I want to be reimbursed for all the feelings and effort that I put into the relationship, is that how it works? Well it should work like that if it doesn't.
And then there's the issue with his friends being a girls, and them hating me. And the issue of him being in love with them all. I mean sweet ever loving Jesus, can we please just grow up and get out of middle school already.
I don't know what to do as of now. This year is going to be really rough. Can our relationship survive a whole year of phone sex and texting? Or are we doomed to break up, falling in with the millions of couples who couldn't hack the military relationship-pre-marriage?
I need to see JMS. I need him to read the 90 million billion pages of otes and thoughts that I've had throughout the past few weeks without him by my side. Oh goodness, what have I done?
Can somebody please help me?
Thanks if you can........"

Life is good, there aren't too many things for me to complain about other than my family. I know I'm not the only person who has to worry about taking care of their parents but it sure does feel like it.

Upward Bound is basically over, thank you God. This was the worst summer that I've ever attended. Tomorrow is our awards ceremony, and then on Tuesday we are leaving for Florida!

Ughg, I need to take a shower because I just got home from work and I definitely smell like cake and ice cream. Go figure.

Yeah so I figured out a few days ago that I am the dumbest bitch in the entire world. You might be wondering what took you so long? Or, how did you make this discovery? Well it all started when I began talking to Jeff again. Big mistake. I can't stand being single, so any chance I get to be with someone I take it, even when I know how much he hurt me last time. So we talked for about a week and then we decided to go to Coonskin last Saturday for Adamfest. It was such a great day. We talked about anything and everything that had happened since we had last saw each other. We said things that we weren't brave enough to say to each other the last time around. We couldn't keep our hands or eyes off each other. The day was great and full of laughter and happiness. He asked me back out, and of course I said yes. So then wanda showed up, but nothing really happened until the end of the day. Summer was getting ready to come and pick me up and Wanda just threw an enormous bitch fit. She really wanted to fight me. Well after that, I asked Jeff to come with me to my house. He actually wanted to. That really surprised me and proved to me that he had changed. So me, Jeff, Summer, and John went back to my house and watched movies and ate pizza. Summer and John left at like 10:30, and then it was just Jeff and I, all alone in my house together. So yeah, we had sex. It wasn't because I felt as if I had to, it was because I wanted to. I guess it wasn't that great of an idea though because three days later he broke up with me. His reasoning was because he thought that our relationship was all about sex. That hurt me so much. To me, our relationship was about love. When I say I love you, I really and truly mean it. When I fall in love, I fall hard, it's one of my weaknesses. His other reason was because he wanted to be a teenage boy and be free. Free to do what, I asked? Well mess around, not be tied down to just one person he said. So you want to be able to have sex with a bunch of random people? No it's not like that... yeah it is Jeff...have a nice life Jeff....end of conversation.... But I miss him so much and I don't know why. I mean I think back at what he said and I know that he is an ass, but I can't help but to love him. I'm a stupid bitch.

Moving on, I need to clean my house. It smells so bad.   

Okay, I feel better now that I have ranted on Livejournal....

Upward Bound is killer. I enjoy my classes, they are interesting and I, unlike most people in Upward Bound, actually try to make the best of the classes and actually learn something. I have no idea why this year is so horrible. It could be because all the people who have a personality graduated and no longer attend. Yeah, I'd say that's the reason why. Everyone keeps leaving. I'm like why? You get paid to take classes. You get to go on two ALL EXPENSES PAID vacations? People are stupid. 

I had to work tonight. I didn't get one break, we were so busy. $1100 dollars in ice cream. Craziness. That really is a lot. My wrist is hurting. Probably not a good sign, but what the hell. I need the money. I love being able to buy whatever the fuck I want, when I want. It feels good not to depend on my Dad for every single thing that I need or want. All I have to work on is saving the money that I earn. Like right now it's easy to do because I'm away from home and preoccupied with school, but during the school year it's harder. Oh, I can't wait for next year. All that Senior shit to buy. And I know i'll buy it because I like the memories. Fuck that.

So I think that I fucked things up with Jimmy. He seems distant now that I've told him that we probably won't date. I don't know, but he was telling me that he thought he loved me and that scared me. First of all, he doesn't even know me. Second of all, love is a very strong word. But now that I sit back and think about it, I wonder if he really meant it, and maybe I just passed up my chance for happiness. Oh the fuck well. I'm beginning to think that being alone/single is the best road for me. I get a lot more accomplished this way. My grades are better, I can concentrate more. But then again, I love having a boyfriend. it makes me feel special inside :( Boo fucking hoo.

I should be tired right now, but I am actually wide awake. This is a good thing because I seriously have to clean up my room. It is really raunchy. I don't like living like this.

Where is my sister? She is not home. I just realized this......

I've been talking to my mom more lately. It's weird, not something I'm used to. She was being really really nice the last time I was with her. Maybe it was because she felt guilty about not contacting her daughter since prom, or maybe she's changed. I really want to believe that it's because she's changed, but who knows. So her 1 year anniversary with this guy Rick is in July. I'm really surprised, but then again I'm not. She promised me that this was the last guy. But I don't believe her. This is the reason of why I didn't get attached to him. Every single time I get attached to one of her boyfriends and I start to feel like family with them, she leaves him. It's happened three times, and I don't know if I could go through it again. Oh well, as long as she's happy.

I keep thinking about Joey. Not a good thing. I need to get him out of my head. Obviously things aren't going to work out between us,but he is just so fucking perfect. i don't know, it just kills me that the one good guy that is interested in me can't be with me. 

I've also thought about Jeff. Not like I want to get back together with him, but I've just been wondering how he is. I mean I did spend four months of my life living and breathing that boy. I would like to maintain a friendship with him, but that obviously won't happen either. Oh well.

Jimmy hates me.

Joey really doesn't talk to me.

Josh Hudson is pissed at me, but I think this is actually a good thing :)

Yeah but I am in Upward Bound at the moment and I am so fucking bored. I mean really, I have nothing to do.

All my homework is finished. I could read Malcolm X, but I'm not in the mood for that. And besides, I just got rid of my week long headache. Reading at this time would only agitate my head.

I get way too many headaches. If I don't get one at least once a week it is considered abnormal.

So I am still feeling very lonely, and I hate this feeling more than I could ever describe. It's like a weight that is always hanging over me. I am alone. No one wants to be with me. 

I am EMO. This is just self pity. I could be with somebody, but I know what I want and everybody who shows the least bit of interest in me is always someone who I consider a brotherly type of person. It's a vicious cycle, I know, but I'm trying to break it.

So I sort of miss work. Weird, I know, but deep down, I love my job. How many people can say that?

In one of my classes we have been working with the stock market. Just the NYSE, not the NASDAQ, but I don't know, I really got into it. But the stock market is also vicious, and I don't need anymore mean things in my life so I think I'm going to chill with it.

Yeah, so does anyone else love Livejournal, lol?

Seriously, it is way more soothing than a therapist.

Much love bitches."

"event","So the day has come. It is my last day of summer before Upward Bound begins. I haven't even packed yet. I really need to.

I'm having a really bad day today. There isn't any particular reason, it has just been a shitty day. Work was hell. I had to stay an extra hour for this girl. I know people don't understand me when I say I hate work because they think that life at an ice cream shop is great. Well it isn't, especially when there is a line all the way to China and everyone orders milkshakes and breezes and blasts and there are only three blinders. I hate making drinks, but it's apart of the job so I have to. 

My life is so gay. I want some action in it. I want a guy in my life. A decent guy, decent looking and such. I'm sick and tired of being alone. 

It's only been a month.

But to me it feels like forever. It probably feels like this because I met someone else, but they don't want to, or can't(I haven't decided which is true), be with me. This particular guy is amazing. I liked every single thing about him. He is what I thought I wanted, but now I'm not too sure about things. It doesn't really matter anyway. He is having some issues of his own to deal with at the moment, and I'm sure he doesn't want anymore on his plate. OH the fuck well. 

Have you ever gotten to that certain point of not giving a fuck? I am at that point. 

But not really. If I was to that point then I would take any guy that offered himself to me. I know what I want, and I am just being immature because I cannot have it, or him.

Gay.

Jesus.

Shit, I need to pack.

I can't seem to make myself go and do it though. Like I just keep typing about it, but do I actually get up and go do it?

Nope.

So right now I am a little bit happy. I am home alone, singing loudly to music that makes me feel better.

Music has that affect on some people and I'm glad to be one of them.

I am gay.

So I think this summer in Upward Bound I am going to have a lot of fun. I don't give a shit about what people think now. I'm going to do what I want. It's about time to.

I want a boyfriend. Both of my best friends have met the guys that they want to marry. It gets a little annoying at times, watching them. Living vicariously through their love lives. It's a little sick, I know, but what else do I have?

So yet again I do understand why I am in such a bad mood. I want something I cannot have. It sucks. I am so immature. I just cannot accept what my options are. I think maybe I am, but I still don't like it. 

Ummmm I need to clean my room. Strike that. I need to clean my whole entire house. It would be a nice surprise for my dad when he comes home on Sunday. yea, but it probably will not happen. 

I think tonight I am going to stay up and do little things that I have been wanting to do. I have a lot of free time tonight so it is perfect.

I have to work tomorrow at eleven. I hate opening. It is so boring. I feel lazy whenever IO am just standing around waiting for someone to come in and buy ice cream. I'll probably just make some boxes or something.

Upward Bound starts next Sunday. OMG!!!! It is my last summer as a student. I am going to make the next six weeks so full of fun I am going to drive myself crazy. A person can only take so much fun you know.

"event","Life is so funny. One day everything is so great, the next day you're wanting to shoot everyone in their face. Today I realized a lot of things. I am going to make  a list of them.

Friends don't last forever.
Girls can be annoying.
Guys use girls.
People lie.
Cats' scratches hurt like hell.
Socks are necessary.
Plants need to be watered.
Parents don't know everything.
White people are just as scary as black people.
I can't drive.
Stop signs are not optional.
Dating a decent guy takes more effort than I have.
Stalkers are more scary in real life than in the movies.
Some, not all, but quite a few young children need shot in the face.
Hitler may still be alive.

The list could go on and on. I am in a really bad mood at the moment. I know why. You don't. I could type it, but what's the point. If I can't make it better, why can you? That's just the thing, no one but me can make anything better. 

It all relates back to my favorite thing in th whole entire world: guys. I get my hopes up to easily. I just don't need to be with anybody. I can't make someone else happy if firstly I can't make myself happy. I don't know, I'm just tired of waiting for that one. You know, the one that sweeps me off my feet. I thought that I might have met him, but then I discovered a word for what we have, or had: lust. Yea, I think I need to chill with the whole dating someone thing, it just never quite works out for me.

But I just have to know, is it too much to ask for a guy who wants to spend every waking minute with me. Okay, maybe not that much time, but you get the point. Or better yet, is it too much to want a guy to want me and not be afraid to show it or say it. If I prayed, I would pray that guys would put their alter egos aside for one day to let girls really see what's under all that manly man shit they have going on. 

I need to sort my life out. I get myself in these situations that only end in me getting hurt. Why? Because I am dumb. I think I am stronger than what I actually am. And me being able to say this makes me even more stupid because if I was smart then I would listen to myself every once in awhile. I think that the best advice comes from yourself, you just just have to decide whether or not you listen to what you have to say.

I feel like Oprah right now. 

Shit, I hate being alone. I am such a whiny bitch though. Seriously I quit. I am defeated. I give up. 

Now all I have to do is let this decision sink in. Tomorrow everything will be back to normal. I will be happy, but not really. It is just a show. I am a good actress, but aren't we all?"

So life has been nothing short of wonderful lately. Aside from school, everything in my life is great. I have a lot to be thankful for such as my great family, friends, boyfriend, job, and coach.

Okay now that I got that emo shit out of my system her is what's really up.

The family is great. Never better. We got a new car. I love the Cadillac. It makes me feel black for some strange reason.

Ummmm, what is there to say about the friends situation. Things have never been better. I just got back from prom dress shopping in Ohio with oh so wonderful Summer Hill. God she is hot. Yes, we took a shower together, but only to save water ;)
Niki and I don't really hang out that much anymore. I miss that whore immensely though. I have been a pretty shitty friend to her now that I sit down and think about it :(

So about Jeffery. What can I say. I like the way he's put together. I really don't know what's going on with him at the moment. The past couple of days have been rough. First he told me he cheated on me, but he really didn't. He only told me that to see if I would stay with him even if he did something dumb. Second, he told me that he didn't want to be tied down in high school and that he wanted to date many people. Now that hurt, but that turned out to not be true, or whatever. Anyways, according to him everything is fine. I love him. I think I love him more than he loves me though :(

Yeah so work is great. I eat entirely too much ice-cream though.

Softball is killer. I've never been so tired and busy and sore in all my life. We haven't won any games :(  Oh fucking well, winning isn't everything, right?  :/

So I have ISS for 2 days because of Hellen Freeman. What a whore :)

So let me elaborate more.

School has been killer, but I'm back on track, and I've been studying and doing my homework like a good little bitch, I mean student. I get so aggravated with Trig because I can't stand it when I do not comprehend something, and Mr. Ferrell doesn't seem to want to help. Biology is gay. I've learned a lot, but I bet if Mrs. burke slowed down just a little bit I would have learned so much more. Ummm, APUSH is a bitch as always, but other than that everything is going well. I just have a lot of busy work that I need to do.

What is there to say about Jeff. I don't know how to put this into words. He just makes me feel special and important. I've definitely never felt this way before. Not with anyone before him. i have to admit, I'm pretty lucky. It's hard to find a decent guy at Capital High School for Gays and Lesbians, but I managed to and I am so happy about it :)
   On Sunday we I got to meet his mother Tammy. She was very nice. I hope she liked me. She works at Kaufman's and she is very pretty. Well after I met her we went to go see When A Stranger Calls. I have no fucking clue what happens past the part where the girl goes and checks on the kids. What can I say, we were the only ones in the theatre. I've never kissed someone for that long :)

Ummmm, work is great. I've eaten so much ice cream these past few weeks. I'm surprised I can still fit into my clothes. I can't wait to get paid. There are so many things that I want to buy! Ughghghg. I have to work tomorrow now that I think about it. Great.

So softball starts soon. I cannot wait for that to begin. Then maybe I can get rid of these flabby thighs and fat rolls on my stomach. I hate being fat. It fucking annoys the crap out of me :(

Operation Get Jeff went off with a bang. We went to see a movie on Sunday, after he was 100% broken up with the Bitch aka Maggie Morris. I had an awesome time. Yes, I took advantage of him. He was not expecting me to kiss him like I did. Hahaha. All he did was tell me that my hair smelled good, and I just looked up into his eyes and made the fuck out with him. Needless to say, I do not know how Final Destination 3 ends :)

So I am so fucking happy.

This week has been rough though. Maggie is really pissing me off. She is trying so hard to make Jeff jealous, but according to him it will never work. Sometimes I wonder though. I am a very jealous person. Like today I couldn't find him at break. I immediately had the thought that Maggie had somehow convinced him to leave me and that they were off in a secluded area doing naughty things together. Then I found him. he was getting me a rose. I felt bad. I've finally decided to just trust him no matter what. No questions asked.

So I am happy

Work is going well. Tonight was so crazy. It was $1 scoop night and I guess every fucking person in Charleston decided to come to Baskin Robin's. My arm hurts so much from scooping like 100 ice-cream balls. I can't wait to get paid. I've worked so much, so my check is going to be big. Yeah!!!!!!!!!!

Biology is gay. It seems as though everyone around me understands and comprehends the material. I just don't get anything that we are studying. It aggravates the hell out of me when I don't understand something.

Mission Get Lauren Jeff went into action this week. It has been going fairly well I'd say. But today Jeff wouldn't even come and talk to me. Apparently he is very shy. Damn, that means I have to step it up and take action. I just want this to work sooooooooooooo badly. Pray for me. I need all the help I can get.

I am getting ready to go on a walk. I am excited! It is misting outside, so it will be cold. I have a lot to think about. Like how Bryan is pissed of at me because of my last blog entry on myspace. I think it is stupid because I can feel any way that I want to, and that is how I felt. I don't feel that way anymore so I took it off.

My sister and I went over to the Capital and passed around noon. I am ready for softball to start. It will keep me out of the house until about seven so I am excited :)

I went to visit Dr. Edleman today. He is my ""psychiatrist"". I don't really consider him a psychiatrist. He is more of a friend, more than a friend actually. He is almost like a father figure to me. I've been going to see him since I was about six. That's almost 10 years. What I like most about him is that he doesn't judge me when I tell him the horrible things that I think. He never lectures me when I tell him about the bad things that I do. In fact, we don't even have our sessions in his office. We usually talk in the cafeteria at CAMC. I told him about Bryan and about how I don't understand why he affected me as much as he did. I mean why do I get so attached to people? I told Dr. E that I can't stand being alone in my house and how I feel like I've lost everything in my life that has ever mattered to me. I said that I feel like I just exist, and that I don't feel like my life has any meaning. I talked to him for a good 2 hours. It made me feel a lot better. When I was getting up to leave he said, ""Lauren, how do you live your life when no one is watching?"" He told me not to answer it, but to think about it and take the answer to heart. 

I thought about it for a long time. I realized that I don't live my life when no one is watching. I just sort of die until someone is around me again. I am living for the people around me instead of living for myself. That is going to change. I need to learn how to make myself happy before I try to make other people happy. 

All I want is to be happy again. I remember when I used to dance around my room, and when I did my homework, and when I read books that me laugh and cry. That is when I was happy. That was before Pappy died, before Bryan. I need that happiness back. I think I locked it away somewhere deep down inside me. I'm going to be happy again though. Even if it kills me, I will be happy :)

I just got back from my walk. I left the house at 9:30, so I've been gone for about an hour. I just walked around downtown for awhile, and then I went to my steps. It is so pretty out tonight. I could see so many stars out. I do a lot of deep thinking at my steps. Tonight I thought about my personality. It is pretty shitty now that I think about it. I mean I hide 75% of who I really am. I am not the funny, happy, sexual, psychotic person that people see. I am a caring, thoughtful, jealous, evil, and ugly person deep down inside. I think the worst of people before I know them. I think about how I would murder you if you make me mad. I get jealous over past boyfriends even when there isn't anything to be jealous of. I'm mean when I should be nice. I cry when things don't go my way. I crack under pressure, but I try to hide it. I hate being alone, but that isn't what I tell people. I wish horrible illnesses upon you when you piss me off. I dream about what I want, but can't have. I wish too much. I am an ugly person.

So Bryan is mad at me. I believe it is because of my last blog entry. I did that on purpose, just to make him mad. But it was true. I mean that was all we had. Every word he said, I listened to. I just hate to think that we won't talk anymore, or that we won't even be friends. He blocked me on myspace, real mature. Oh well. Whatever makes him happy.

I am going to get ready for bed. Peace."

After UB I went to go see Tristan and Isolde with Niki. I wanted to go see the movie because I thought a good love story would cheer me up. OMG, WAS I WRONG!!! That had to have been was of of the most sad movies I have ever seen. Although there was a lot of sex. Isolde got it like five times a day. Then she just disappears, WTF? Oh well, it was still a good movie, although it was rather morbid.

So then I went to Niki's new house to help paint her room. I have so much paint in my hair. I need to wash it out like right now. It's purple, just like Niki's room :)

Niki and I have a plan. It is actually a mission, and I am going to call it Mission Get Lauren Jeff. Yeah the title is pretty self explanatory.

I can't believe that it is only Saturday. I get to sleep in tomorrow! WOOHOO!

I just wrote a vicious blog entry on myspace. I hope Bryan reads it. But really, I mean come on, he says the same things to every girl he meets. ""You have no idea how good you look"" It's like he goes by a story line. I just can't believe it. Really and honestly, it's pretty fucking sad.

Yes, I still miss him, but I will get over him with time. After all, he certainly has gotten over me quickly enough. And you know what I discovered? Everything single little inside joke that we ever had together, he has used with other girls, so that makes them not special. Like you just wait, and I'm going have one of your friends throw something at you. It might seem dumb to you, but it was all we had, so I took it to heart. Thanks Bryan for ripping my heart to pieces. I've been sewing it back together since January 3.

Well I just got back from my nightly walk to my steps. It was cold, but the stars are out and it looked lovely. I stayed out until 10 o'clock last night looking up at the stars. That's my favorite past time. Just sitting and staring into space.

Well I have UB tomorrow, so I better go remind Niki because she is my ride. 

Peace out homies."

"event","Well today was a great day at school. Surprisingly I went. I wasn't going to go, but then I thought about how much I've already missed. So classes were boring, but I was there so it counts.

I went running a little bit ago. Wow, was that fun. It just showed me how out of shape I actually am. I can't believe I've let myself get to this point. Softball starts in like a month. I have to get toned up, haha. Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen any time soon.

So I have a huge AP history test tomorrow. It really isn't that big, but I am actually going to pass this one because I am going to study this time. I have my book and a whole page of notes to review with so I think I'll be able to get it down before 4th period tomorrow.

I  have officially decided not to talk to Bryan for as long as I can. I just want to see if this makes us or breaks us, if that makes any sense. I don't know how long I can make it because I truly love just talking to him, but I'm trying my hardest because I want him to see what's it's like to actually lose someone. He never really lost me the last time. I've always been here, he just hasn't taken advantage of it. I'm just curious to see if he misses me in any way. Probably not, but there is always a chance. He found my journal, but he said he wasn't going to read it anymore. This is why I am just going to continue to write as if I never knew he read it. If he does still read it, ughghg. It makes me feel very vulnerable.

Yeah I made dinner for my family. Lasagna! I haven't cooked anything for so long. It was a relief to actually eat something wholesome and filling for once. The only thing is that once you cook the food, you  kind of don't feel like eating it, so there is  a lot of it left.

And now I must do the damn dishes.

Actually, they can wait a little while. After all, they will be there when I decide to go wash them.

So I am going to get a job. I really don't care where at this point. I'm thinking Subway(don't laugh) But it really is most convenient for me, and I think I could rock that shit.

Well I just want some money for myself. i would like to get my car some time soon, and I can't do that if I don't help pay for the insurance. Having a car would solve so many problems. I would be able to sleep a whole extra hour. I could do as many plays and sports as I wanted to. I could drive to Texas and make love to Bryan in about 16 hours.LOL. Yeah, having my car would be helpful.

I am feeling a little bit better today. My stomach isn't aching, and I have somewhat of an appetite. Kevin actually talked to me. I thought he might be weird after the other night, but surprisingly, he was just as kind and sweet as ever.*Wishes a terrible disease upon Kate* OMG, that was horrible.

Hmmmm, I have nothing more to say so peace out."

But oh well. When I went outside earlier it started to rain. Luckily I like rain, so I just stayed outside and got soaking wet. It was very fun, but cold.

I am so tired! But I have to clean my freaking room, and I have to read for AP history.

So, I'm going to go do that."

Wow, I shouldn't say that because I know they can.

Mom is being a mega bitch.

She showed up this morning and was like, ""Let's go shopping!""

Wtf, ummmm no.

We aren't goody goody mother daughter bitches.

I don't want to hang out with her, she makes me feel like absolute crap.

I look at her and think about how much I would give for her to have had me.

I'm very sure people's lives would be a lot better if I wasn't here.

Yeah, I don't feel good.

I want to punch someone in their face. It doesn't matter who, just anyone will do.

Bryan is driving me absolutely crazy! He just can't seem to make up his mind, and he doesn't confide in me so you know what I say, fuck it. He knows I'm always here for him, so that will have to do. 

Yeah so I talked with Kevin. That was the most awkward thing I've done in awhile. I hope things don't get weird between us, but knowing my luck they will. And knowing my luck again, Kait will probably find out and absolutely forbid him from talking to me. Yeah so everything is just great.

I have this huge craving to play the original Zelda on the original Nintendo. I want to play it now, but guess what? I don't have the damn game so I am screwed!

I need to eat something, but every time I even look at food, my stomach starts to twist and turn. I think all the emotional things that are going on around here are starting to have an effect on me. I just am so tired of people's bullshit. I just want a set plan for my life. I want to know what's going to happen tomorrow, and the day after that. I don't want to be alone anymore! I just would like to be happy and confident and cheerful for once. 

Dad is buying a new car. I am so glad. The Blue Van is very worn out and needs to be put out of her misery.

I tried cleaning my room today. Yeah, no it did not happen. It really didn't even get started because as soon as I got in my room I found a bath set that I got for Christmas and I decided to go and take a bath. 

I have the attention span of a 3 year old.

So I'm going to stay with Kathryn McClure tomorrow. It will be fun. We haven't hung out in so fucking long. I miss that little Mexican bitch.

I feel like I should be doing something productive, but I can't think of what it i. Hopefully I will remember what it is soon.

I hate cigarettes! I hate the smell and the smoke. It makes me sick to my stomach. I'm going to go hide my Dad's cigarettes. He needs to quit smoking anyways.

So tonight I have everything all planned out as follows:

9:00-sit around and do nothing.

10:00-Call Matty.

11:00-Take a really long shower.

12:00-watch Father of the Bride 2

2:00-Get on the computer.

3:00- try to go to bed.

yeah so it's going to be fun.

I need a life!

Ughghghghgh.

I think I am a little immature.

I need someone to talk to.

Ughgh, so today was totally and completly boring. Nothing happened. I dozed and listened to music all day long. It makes me feel so lazy when I have days like these, but I can't help it because every time I move, I get dizzy and light headed.

I wish I had a really good book to read. I want a mystery book with lots of murders cause theat is what I like. Yeah, I'm psycotic.

It is 6:14 a.m.

The funny thing is that medicines that usually put people to sleep have the opposite affect on me. I guess I shouldn't have drank all the cough syrup in the house.

The lyrics to Bryans song on Myspace. I don't know if they are supposed to mean anything. I know that when I change my song, I make sure that it has a message hidden in it. I don't really know if he does the same. We kind of had a fight tonight. He finally found my journal. *Damn* I am brutally honest in this thing, and now he knows everything.

Ask me 4 questions - any 4 no matter how personal, private, or random. I have to answer them honestly and I have to answer them all. In turn you post this message in your own journal and you have to answer the questions that are asked to you."

"event","So basically, I'm bored, there is nobody online, and i promised to write in here.

Not gonna lie, today was just not great...I got pulled out of study playing guitar with Jesus in Bridger's room to go get my picture taken. What's up with that? And then Sarah and I had video and meida while *EVERYONE* else had 1st lunch. Amy and I figured out in calc afterwards there are a grand total of 6 seniors in that lunch. And at UF practice today, Novak and I were the only two kids who aren't complete potheads, so I left before they all went to smoke in the woods, and it was really awkward 'cause I don't actually know the little kids...w/e

Went after school to talk to my guidance counselor, I found out I'm retarded and am not going to college, but that I should tell colleges I want to study history? which I might do if it gets me in.

Im psyched 'cause we get to record soon, and our cd is going to be amazing :)

peace out"

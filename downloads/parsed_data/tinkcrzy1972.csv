I got a marginal bit of work done for the BDC blogs, but nothing personal got attended to.  Heck, I barely even tweeted!  This is unusual for me.  Today I finally feel like I'm coming out the other side, but I'm not quite to where I have anything witty to share with you all.  Maybe tomorrow, so you should check back?"

"event","I just spent my day at the shop with my friends.  Over the course of the day, I got some major validation in the form of all of them asking for my help in increasing traffic to their websites.  I will be helping several friends in different capacities, and I'm sure I'll be sharing their sites and blogs with you here as I do.  I'm looking forward to doing some work with people that respect what I do, after all this fighting to be heard by the people that pay me.  I'm ready to be very proactive about things and build a portfolio of my work so that it will be easier to find another job if this gets too much more frustrating.  The stress is getting hard to take."

It's Friday, so time to show you another progress pic of Serendipity Fae.  As you can see, I've remembered to take some time for myself every day to stitch.  The top portion of the wings is completely finished, as is her hair.  There are bits to fill in with the flowers crowning her hair, but I didn't want to waste full cuts of floss for those bits knowing I have to use those colors in the wings, so I waited until I can use the floss other places as well.  I suspect that by the time Friday rolls around next week, you will see the wings completed, those bits filled in, and some real progress on the dress.  As a reminder, here's what she'll look like all finished:

"event","Well, I can't believe we are here already!  The first part of the Dancing with the Stars finale is tonight.  On the one hand, I'm excited because we'll be seeing some fabulous dancing.  On the other, I'm so bummed because another season is nearly over, and I don't know what I'll do for my dancing fix!  Anyway, I thought I would share with you today what my favorite freestyle has been over the 7 seasons of the show.  It's not a common pick, and many of you may disagree with me, but for this blogger, the freestyle is all about taking a risk and trying something different, and that is what happened here!

"event","I think I'm starting to find some balance amid the chaos that is life right now.  I've managed to get some time to unplug the last few days and do something other than work.  I think I may have finally realized that sitting here at the desk 12 hours a day doesn't make me more productive, it only makes me tired and cranky.  As I've found time to get back to my other hobbies and my family, I'm finding that ideas for how to help at work flow a little more easily.  I think I need to stop short of the saturation point, where nothing else can get in, and take time to absorb and reflect.  It would, of course, be easier to do that if I had some idea from those above me which ideas are helping and which ones we should let go.  They are preoccupied with the rest of the site, though, so I keep plugging along like the little engine that could.  I'm hoping that eventually someone will let me know whether or not my efforts are working."

Many of the men in my current circle of friends also will not ask for directions, preferring to drive around until they stumble upon where they were headed. &nbsp;There are some smart enough to own GPS, of course, but not all. &nbsp;There are also some women I&nbsp;know that refuse to ask for help of any sort, viewing it as a sign of weakness. &nbsp;Regardless of gender, I personally happen to see it as a sign of strength when you can admit that you are lost or have made a mistake, and can freely ask for assistance."

As promised, here is my recipe for Cake Cookies.&nbsp; I don't remember where I&nbsp;found it, but I use it often, and it is very easy to change things up with simple changes like the flavor of cake you are using, or adding in chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, or whatever strikes you as yummy!&nbsp; Enjoy, and feel free to pass on to others.

1 cake mix
1/2 c. oil
1/4 c. water
1 egg

Mix ingredients. &nbsp;Drop by spoonfools onto greased cookie sheets or form into balls and roll in sugar. &nbsp;Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 14 minutes.


See how easy this is?&nbsp; A lot of times, if I am baking for holidays or some other occasion to give cookies to others, I&nbsp;will mix a batch of yesterday's pumpkindoodles up, and while they are doing their thing chilling in the fridge, I can whip out a batch of these and a batch of chocolate chip cookies while I&nbsp;wait for the pumpkindoodles to be ready.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy these as much as my family does, if you try the recipe, let me know what you think!

Fondly,
Sharon"

I promised some friends over on Twitter that I would post this recipe on my blog tonight.&nbsp; I believe it came originally from the American Heart Association.&nbsp; These cookies turn out fluffy, and not too pumpkin-y.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy them as much as I&nbsp;have.

Pumpkindoodles:

1 c. butter
1 1/2 c sugar
1/2 c. canned pumpkin
2 tsp. vanilla
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. cream of tartar
1/2 tsp. salt
1 egg
2 2/3 c. all purpose flour (although I&nbsp;have done them with whole wheat and they still were yummy)
1/2 c. sugar (splenda worked well here, too)
1 Tbs. cinnamon

Beat butter 20 seconds.&nbsp; Add 1/2 c. sugar and pumpkin, beat until combined.&nbsp; Beat in vanilla, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt.&nbsp; Beat in as much of the flour as possible with mixer, and stir in the rest by hand.&nbsp; Cover and chill for one hour. &nbsp;Drop cookies in cinnamon sugar and roll to coat.&nbsp; Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet. &nbsp;Bake in a preheated 350 degree oven 10 minutes or until edges are golden.


Tomorrow I'll post my recipe for Cake&nbsp;Cookies. &nbsp;There are so many good ideas with those!&nbsp; Please leave me a comment if you try this recipe and let me know how you liked it.

Fondly,
Sharon"

"event","Hey everyone!<br /> <br /> Hope this finds you doing well and getting in the mood for some holiday cheer! The upcoming gift giving season is on my mind today, and with the economy right now, I know we're all looking for some great ideas on a budget. Here are some of the gifts I plan on giving this season:<br /> <br /> The gift of dance: The website I work for, <a target=""blank"" href=""http://www.ballroomdancechannel.com/"">Ballroom Dance Channel</a>, has quality dance lessons from some of the pros from Dancing with the Stars at the affordable price of $4.99. If you have a friend or family member that is a fan of the show, why not give them the gift of ballroom dance? New options are coming soon for ways you can take our lessons, and if you want to give them a try before you buy them for yourself or a friend, we have a FREE salsa lesson you can get to by clicking <a target=""blank"" href=""http://www.ballroomdancechannel.com/salsa-basic-step-free"">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Another great option for holiday gifts is the gift of scent. My friend Dorothy is working with a company called <a href=""http://www.scentsy.com/dorothyl"">Scentsy</a>, and they have wickless candle warmers and the wax melts to go in them. There is sure to be a style to fit every home and budget, so if you love candles but are like me and hate the thought of forgetting to blow them out, Scentsy is a fabulous option. You'll want to order soon to have those warmers here in time for gift giving, so stop by today!<br /> <br /> For those of you going green this holiday season, why not have a look at <a target=""blank"" href=""http://www.lushusa.com/shop/"">Lush</a>? My friend Sammi turned me on to this awesome company, and so far I'm loving their products. If you aren't sure what to get your friend or loved one, gift certificates are available, and can be used online or in store.<br /> <br /> If you have a cross stitch or needlepointer in your gift giving circle, may I suggest <a target=""blank"" href=""http://stitcherstreasures.com/"">Stitchers Treasures</a>? Vicki, the owner, has a great brick and mortar shop, but also has a strong presence online, and can help you put together a fabulous gift for that stitcher that you love. If you'd prefer your needleworker pick out their own supplies, Vicki also has gift certificates available.<br /> <br /> These are some of the gifts I will be giving this holiday season. What gifts will you be handing out this year? Please leave me your comments below! Until next time....<br /> <br /> Fondly,<br /> Sharon                <br />"

The kids are loving their new schools and Tim seems very happy with our new home as well.  I've done the best I can to make it a home for him to enjoy in the little bit of time he has left, but its been stressful the last few days.  Not everything made it on the truck; we've been schlepping by car for a week now, and its starting to take its toll.  We're finding there are a lot of things we had that we didn't realize we had, and a lot of it we just didn't need.  I'm working on weeding everything out, and hopefully will be able to have a yard sale soon and make some money off our cast-offs.  Tim leaves on Weds for deployment, and that has been hard to deal with too.  I wish I had more time to just hang out with him.  I guess that's going to have to be a goal for when he gets home, the making our relationship a priority."

I'm lagging this morning, so I think I'll grab a nap before I head up to the new house today.  I'm hoping that a little bit more time all nice and warm in bed will make the muscles a bit less sore from helping with the couch yesterday.

"event","Yeah, I'm a big doofus and forgot the camera when I went up to the new house today, but its starting to really feel like home.  My friend Heidi and her hubby Hank brought the fridge they had for us, and a couch I got from my friend Aleata for the den.  We have to do some rearranging in the den because the couch doesn't fit how I wanted it, but Maria and I are going back up tomorrow to see about that, and take a load of boxes.   Then we are going to go hit the thrift stores to see what other goodies we can find for my new house.  Its so nice to have somewhere that I am excited about and want to actually take time to theme and decorate, I've never really had that before.  The one and only thing that I am not 100% thrilled with is an easy fix, I just have to ask permission, is that I'd like to have a sprayer on the kitchen sink.  I just need to call and ask if we are allowed to do it, and then ask Tim to put it in on his time off before he leaves.   I'm not enjoying being at the old house anymore, I am wanting to spend more and more time at the new one, because it feels so full of possibilities and new life, instead of this drab, dreary place that we are moving from partly because its just so ugly!  Oh well, the not liking being here is inspiring me to get more packed and out of the way.  LOL!"

"event","Hey you all everybody!  This is my first shot with LJ.  I've been blogging at Yahoo 360, I'll post a link to all that as soon as we get the computer moved and set up at the new house.  Can I just tell y'all how much moving SUCKS?  I mean, the getting everything done at the new house, that's a blast, because its a new beginning, and the place is seriously my dream home, but the packing and the schlepping all the stuff from here to there really blows.  I'm so ready to be moved in over there and have everything done!  I'll try and get some pics up of the new place soon, I'd like to get it at least a little bit decorated first.  Please, if you're taking time to read, take time to leave me a comment, will ya?  I'm a bit nervous with all this yet, and I'd like to know what people think about what I'm writing.  Over at 360, I feel like I'm just blogging to hear myself blog, you know?  Thanks!

Tink"

soo bahh
i hate when people move
especially this 10 year old girl, lauren.
i love her
so much.
and she's moving
not to mention her family..
gosh they would take me in their home to live with them in a heartbeat
they appreciate me.
amazzzinnng
so somehow i managed to make this 10 year old girl look up to me 
and she told me that.
and she was about to cry when i left her house today
because she thought it was the last time she'd ever see me.
it isn't
i'll see her
just because she's too amazing.
i cried
because i love her and her family.

so how to put into words what someones words mean to you.

it's impossible.



i could've written this out much nicer

Horrible Horrible day:
Woke up late.
Did all my school.
Learned that Chloride is a Mineral.
Then Math.
ARG MY GOSH.
My mom and i had a fight.
And she basically told me, what seemed her telling me she thought i was stupid.
I of course took it the wrong way.
But flipped out because i'm tired of hearing her shit about how she doesn't believe i DO care how i do in school.
I got up out of my seat, stood up, taller than her i feel the power. haha.
and yelled at her.
i NEVER yell in a mean way.
it's always joking, or to get a point across.
i can count on one hand how many times i've yelled for mean things.
I apoligized like always.
I feel guilty really easily
So we went to Macarthur.
and her and i were fine.
Then we were in a store, and she commented this book i was looking at like ""oh that's too hard for you""
i was appauled.
so i walked out of the store, and sat in a chair.
And supposedly my behavior was rude.
Anyways.
I almost lost going tomorrow.
Got it back. by realizing i was the one who was rude and bitchy today.



Anyways.
I love you Diane.
You're on the same boat i am.
We'll go sailing.
It'll be fun

Where to go when nothing's happening.
We glance across to see nothing but a reflection in the puddle.
If it's what you want, then that's what it will be.

I locked the door, and lost the key.
Now no one knows who or what it will be.
Although we're nothing what we seem.
Skip by my side in the downpour of rain.
The water up to our knees.
Skip and sing Merririririrlly.

You skipped the drama, and found your grace."

yay for friday night
mall/sleepover!!hehehhee

okay
i found these two poems
so read them



A call through the night.
One persons words fought throught their life.
Rebounded on one others heart.
Forget the day we said we'd play.
Forget the way you said you'd care.
Talk to your shadow, it never fails to appear.
Except when the one you love is near.
Love and hope and truth aren't fair
Cross your heart and be honest with fear.




If they could hear you they'd sing words you want to hear.
Twisted thoughts and rapid love.
Memories you wish to have.
Happiness you wish to gain.
Gather it up in a handful one day.
Walk away with a smile some day
Grow to learn and learn to grow.
Forget the worst, and find the best.
Walk hand in and very slow.
Hide and seek you will play.
Someday you'll  meet that mystery guest."

She was the girl i never knew.
One more moment, until the event.





Flowers of memories
Wisdom of lies.
The youngest one runs to you, with watery eyes.

Hold the flower until it wilts.
Erase the lies and all the guilt.
Hold the tears back with all your might.

By now you should know it gets dark at night.
Dreams of hope, and fears of life.
Extrordinary messages seen throughout the time.

The time flew by, with the words.
The world you saw through your eyes, never returned.
Amazing thoughts you finally learned.

Hand the flower back to the earth.
Wrap up tight in a bundle of truth.
Dry those teary eyes, and find your way."

Tehee

Friends are wishy washy.
I only need one person in this world.
And this person is the one who will come to my house and throw paper/rocks/salt from Olive Garden,candy rappers, at me to show me she was mad at me for something i said.
She will sit on my couch and yell at me to try to tell me something.
And i understand.
We both learn from our mistakes, our troubles, our worries, our love together.
That will never end.
If you have trouble getting over emotional crap that you can't just let go of, you need to start believing more in what's right than yourself.

We shopped
and had loads of fun

So we got our icecream from DQ none the less
and sat at this big table in the middle of the food court
and these two guys came over and sat with us
*scratches leg*
totally random sorry
and so the cuter one saw me smiling at him and took it upon himself to drag his chubby/funny/french fry eating/ friend over to sit with us
I seriously laughed for like what seemed an hour
he was cute yes.
but the carrie started talking to them.
They're Mormons, 18 years of age, and only the chubby guy goes to college at tcc.
They sat for like 15 mins with us
Then they had to go help kids do stuff.. (probably lie) because i kept staring off into the distance and Jean Marie wasn't talking either and Carrie ran out of stuff to ask.

See what smiling at cute boys gets you into people?
THEY COME SIT NEXT TO YOU THAT'S WHAT

Or does every single teenage girl out there watch tv everyday and want to be what they see on tv.
Or what they see on magazine covers.
APPEARANCE IS IT?
""FATTY"" i take as a joke.
Trust me if you call me fat, or agree with me on a joking matter about it i won't go become anorexic and start cutting myself *cut cut cut*
I don't get why everyone is so worried about their appreance these days.
All i care about is who you are.
What you do to help yourself. and make yourself happy.
Yes everyone has flaws.
But don't go killing yourself biotches..

I've found lately i love my guy friends 10x more than any female friends i've had in the past
Guys don't seem to be as judgemental, possibly because they only care about females FREAKIN BODIES
But anyways
The guys i love and hang out with love me for me
I can burp and they don't care.
Or i can tell them about when i was 5 and my mom almost killed me and they'll jsut be like ""well we're here for you now""
i mean seriously
If you don't have any guy friends
and you're a female
go out and find yourself some good ones.
don't trust easily though
guys are tricky little asses..
Anyways
the moral of this entry is

Girls are anorexic biotches and guys are perverted semi-caring fools.

I'm usually not this harsh

I'm looking forward to reading your reply to this Diane."

I don't expect answers.
But opinions are more than welcome.

:::::::::::::::::::: Why do i have so many questions, and have one person i want to answer them all?

I'm done with the questions.
i could rattle on and write 6 paragraphs 100 pages 42 years long of stuff i want to know and my opinions but i won't
SO OVERALL
Friday night rocked. Stephen, Joanna, Caleb, Justin, Ellen and Besty.
JOANNA AND I SCREAMED SO LONG AND HARD CHEERING FOR STONEBRIDGE NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE GAME.
Well we did when the guys started piling on top of eachother, because that was funny.
<3 ahh we loved running infront of the stands through the people.
Expect when i got stuck behind this really weird guy, and he turned around and winked at me.
weirdos.
Then freeze tag in wal-mart.
Hoorah for that.
Then spent the night at joannas, and woke up at 9am this morning when nathan came in and threw a massive blanket on me and yelled at me ""BREATH NATALIE"" because i wasn't moving..
i enjoy being under blankets...

Well nothing to guess...i suppose.
Going to the Western Branch high homecoming crap tonight..bah.
My mom totally doesn't/didn't trust me, i think we worked it out yesterday.
When she called me a ""slut"" i just stared at her and said ""what did you just say"" and she flipped out.
Anyways i guess i supposedly hurt her feelings, because i overheard her saying i was getting ""chubby"" and i really don't care at all, so i told aubrey that my mom said that..and my mom read it (psht she got on my computer the other night) and got all mad that i told aubrey something she didn't mean. SO i really don't care who thinks i've gained weight/i'm chubby/ WHATEVER ANOREXIC SCREW YOU. I don't care to be as skinny as i am/was.
ANYWAYS
So tonight.
Should be fun.
I can't wait.
Stephen is going to give me a hug.
I REFUSE to hug him first, oh yeah mr. you heard me.
And the boy still remains...ahh he won't go away but it's a good thing. i'm starting to like that he's still around <3

ahhh alright
Thanks to Diane and Rosie if they ever read this, it seems no one reads it..AHHH
Anyways
Back to school/going shopping with my mom, and then to Joannas to go to the thingy tonight.
TACO BELL AFTER THE GAME cannot wait <3
Finallllly i'm happy
AND I DON'T NEED A BOYFRIEND TO MAKE ME HAPPY.
So there."

Wonders of nothing seems hopeless enough.
Stems of flowers, and songs in your head.
They'll walk together, hand in hand.
Tomorrow's her last one night stand.
Words of wisdom someone said.
Sometimes nothing can seem to comprehend.
Records played for hours and hours.
Smiles of love passed around.
Love of from hours have been rewound.
Wouldn't you guess it's all lost tomorrow?
Forevers day will never come.

Just pretend and go along, once a skip then hum a song.

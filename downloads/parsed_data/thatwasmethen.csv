"event","I wish there was a nail place where the people actually spoke english. I mean I hate getting my nails done, but my inability to understand a word they are saying makes things so much worse. I hate when they talk to me. I just agree with everything they say and sometimes the things they are asking require real answers. I swear they always ask you if you have a boyfriend too. When you say you dont have one then they make a huge deal about it and ask you why not.  Since they didnt understand what I wanted done with my nails it took 2 hours for them to get done. I wanted them filled in but they just sanded them or whatever the hell you call it. So, they had to start all over. Now, they are filled in french tips that are extremely short (they barely even make the tapping sound, but thats what I wanted) and they have a black star on one nail on each hand. So, now I only have a hour before work. GREAT. I spent my whole day at a nail place. I HATE getting my nails done, so blah.
Tonight I work 5:30- 10:30. I think Kortnee wants me to block for her so I might do that. Brian is suppost to call me tonight, so maybe I'll hang out with him. He called me last night when he got home. :) I'm worried. I'm afraid that he is gonna change his mind about me. I mean lately it seems like the guys I really do end up liking change their minds. I just really hope he doesnt do that. I mean there are guys that like me, that I dont like back, but the ones I really do like seem to do it. As of now though, things are good. He calls me and he's awesome to hang out with. I'm just so worried! lol. We'll see...
Alright I'm gonna go eat dinner.
Anyone who is off Wednesday or works at night-- GO TO THE BEACH. I've already got Krysta, Fesha, Amanda, and Katie coming with me and I'm going to see if Brian and John want to go (cause I want Krysta to meet John. Hehe) So, join the fun.

Today I spent with Brian and Adam. Meghan came at the end which was way cool. I had fun. I taped Brian and Adam skating and we played 007 at Brian's.  We also went to the mall and twistee treat. Went to the High School and talked to Matt Izzi and Steve. I got called sexy by little kids and they asked me if Brian was from China. I also got hit with a basketball by them on the basketball court. Exciting.
I was suppost to go with Oriana and her friends to The Beanery tonight. It got all messed up. She said, ""Call if you go anywhere"" and told me she couldn't leave till 7 or 8.
So, I called at 7 or 8ish from Brian's. I guess she has already called my house (early!!!) and was gonna pick me up. Obviously, I wasn't there. So, when I called her a little later she said she'd call back in 2 mins and didn't. It sucked.
School today was horrible. ISS... had so many annoying ""hard-asses"" that I wanted to scream. It was pure boredom from start to finish. I couldn't even sit by Aubrey and Austin wasn't there. It was just great.

I had experiments in 5th with Aubrey and Tj.
In drivers ed we did parallel parking. I'd never done it before. He said.... I did perfect and he was really impressed. What now?!? Haha. Not a great accomplishment when you have a license, a car, and drive everyday, and when your teacher is a moron- but shh- Don't tell.
I got called down to the office 6th to Coburn and guess what? I have ISS Wednesday. Oh, Yay. I hate ISS. It's so boring... I'd rather have OSS.
Hung out with Matt after school.
Worked, Matt visited on break. Me and Plish had break together at 7:30 and we were the only cashiers in the store on register. We had blockers left and that was it. So, no one to take us off register or coming in. Thats called bad scheduling, kids. So one register was open with Jen our manager and express. Oh well, not my problem. Plish is so awesome though, I love that kid. There were 2 new kids... they seemed pretty nice. One kid I knew from church when I was like 8. Neat, I guess. John gave me a piggy back ride to my car when I was leaving. So, he got paid to take me to my car. :o Sweet deal.
HOLY SHIT. A murderer escaped from the pinellas county jail at 1:00 today. THATS SCARY! He is out there somewhere... holy shit. My mom says I have to lock all my doors in my car when I'm out and lock up the house when I come home. Seriously, that is scary. Go that guy for getting away though. Who hears about people escaping from jail anymore? Think of that... Wow. I wonder what he's thinking. They've got all the schools under lock down and everything. Crazy.
Today: School. I cheated on my math test with Katie. The rest of the day was easy.
Tonight I'm going with Matt, Katie, and Josh and going to a party. Should be exciting. :) We're probably gonna drink or something along those lines. We'll see.

He was suppost to go straight home and didn't. So, he says he'll probably be grounded. I hope not. We have plans for Friday, so being grounded wouldn't work out. He'd leave anyway, or so he says.
Work was awesome. There is this new girl Allisha. I was nice to her cause she seemed really cool and everything and I think new friends are fun. She brought this floppy lobster to work today. It was so bad ass... I named it Lenny. Me and Brittany were hiding it and taking it from each other all night. I stuffed him in a paper towel roll and wore him tucked in my shirt when cashiering. Brittany wore it on her sholder and guarded it in her pocket. She won though. :( Back to Allisha tho--I was just treating her like I'd known her forever. Like I joked with her and included her in all our slacking off and jokes... and you know what she did? Before I was leaving to go home she told me she wanted to thank me for being so nice and welcoming to her. She said I made her feel like a 'publix person' and like she had been working there forever and I made it easier for her being new. It was so nice! So, now I think she is... the best ever. It was really nice to say. It made my night. Plus, she brought Lenny! So, I have to like her either way.
Hmm... lets see what else.
I missed 1st period today. I didn't wake up until 7:30 for school. It sucked. Matt kept me up till 1:30 so I'll blame it on him! That'll work. I was disappointed I missed 1st... it's one of my favorite classes. Sorry, Mike! Haha. The rest of school was the same routine.

So, I hung out with him and Adam until I had to go to work. We watched Oprah. :) We were going to eat Adam's Easter chocolate while watching it but he was afraid it would be too girly at the same time... haha. Fun times.
Work was fine. Joe got asked to leave early. Who knows what the hell he did. Everyone wants to know. I'd ask him- but we are no longer on speaking terms. He won't talk to me b/c I picked on him and called him a asshole (jokingly). He's stupid... he chose the one person who didn't have a problem with him at work and started being a jerk to them.

If he has a problem-- tell me. Stop going to my friends about all this shit you hear.

He just called and asked if were still going together to prom. He's like ""well I'm not going with you if you have a boyfriend"". I don't. He says everyone is saying I'm going out with some kid from River Ridge. That kid would be Matt. We're not going out. I just met him. ""I was like were not going out, were talking. I'm allowed to talk to people you know."" I said it with some attitude but I cant help it. I can do what I want- Travis and I are not even remotely together. We wont be either.

So, today was alright. I got a 90 on my memorization of the gettysberg address. I'm happy with that-- its a A. Melissa, Court, Amanda Gonyer and me blocked all the kids that run down to lunch today.

Tonight I work: 5-9. My next night off is Friday. That kinda sucks. I had a good long break at the end though, so I can't complain. I wish more people from school worked with me. Even with Southgate closing for a while NO ONE came to my store. WHY?? Change to Chelsea Place. Please? Lol.

I bet you I'm there till 11 or 12, and I'm being completely serious. Mandy is pregnant and I'm not as fast as the real blockers. So much for that break I was looking forward to. Stupid jerks. Now I'm going to be that much more stressed out. Whatever.
School was fun today. Exactly the same as everyday basically.
I'm going to go eat before I go to work. 4-8. Oh, yay.
Later."

"event","I forgot the best part of my day yesterday...
Corey hit his back and ass on a backetball hoop pole and he was really sore. So... I went down Dove (a street by anclote elementary) that is bumpy as hell over and over again . I was going really fast... He was flying out of his seat and slamming back down. Hahaha. It was so funny. Then, I turned around in a driveway and went back again. It was great.
Today was fun. We had that sub again in 5th. Me and Tj were fighting again. He kept pinching me... so I pinched him and I made him bleed. I felt really bad! Then he hit me in the face and I bit my lip and it was bleeding... so it was even.
Hmm... Me and Travis are on a friends level now. I wrote him a letter today in school. Thats what I want for now, but I feel so bad about it. I just feel really bad. I just wish I liked him. How nice would that be. How can you tell someone that? That they are doing everything right and you just dont like them? Everything is always so complicated. He's great and it's-- just not there. Maybe when we hang out or something. What if we hang out and I start to like him and then he's like 'oh, it's to late?' What if we hang out and I still feel the same? I dont know. I'm just afraid of making a wrong decision. I had to do something though. I just dont know how to explain it to him... I wish someone could for me! haha.
He's still my prom date. :) 
I dont really feel like writing anything. I have to work 4-9:30 today. I am so sick of working. It's like I dread going there every night. I can't wait for spring break. Ahh. I'm gonna ask for less hours. I could do with 18-20 a week. Better then 23-24. They'll probably get mad though. Whatever.
See ya."

"event","Yesterday:This lady said the nicest thing to me at work. She was all excited to come in my line because she said I was her favorite cashier. She was asking me how school was going and stuff and she's like you go to school and then work?? She said how proud my mom must be and I should take all of spring break off and have fun. She's so cool. I remembered her, which was neat.
My day today was cool. My grandma got me a surprise...
A prom dress!
I love it. It is so nice. It's tight, like I wanted, and gold-ish yellow. Its got a lot of sparkles and stuff and is strapless. I'm really happy with it. Plus I got see thru shoes to go with it. I thought that was so nice of her. She told me she got it for me because she loves me and knows I work hard and I deserved it. :) 
My classes were boring today except for 1st. I did a news thing with Alli. She sang to Spongebob and then I took a frog puppet and we rapped. Hahaha. Some people thought it was really stupid but I don't care. I was dancing and laughing on screen and stuff-- and then they told me they were still taping. So, Im on the news dancing with a frog puppet on and cracking up laughing. Then, you see them tell me and I just stop and walk away. Hahaha. I liked it. After that I had to watch this guy talk about USF for a hour and a half. Then I stayed in the media and talked to Troy. 5th me and Tj fought all of class over a pen. It was fun... really middle-schoolish but fun. Tj is the best.
After school I went with Corey. I showed him my prom dress and went to visit Amy. Then we went to the pool/jacuzzi. It was HORRIBLE. This mentally handicapped kid would NOT stop following us. He was following Corey mostly. When he would get to us he would start tapping on our shoulders and put his feet on us and stuff. First it was in the jacuzzi, then in the pool. We kept swimming away but he wouldnt stop! He followed everywhere. He got mad and came up and yelled ""DAMN!"" when Corey kept getting away. Then this little boy came in the pool. The kid was all up on that. He was like ON TOP of the boy. He went right up in his face and the boy backed up like 50 feet with this scared look. Corey and I lost it. Oh my god. The boys mom was like 'get out of the pool'... and the kid followed. He was chasing the boy and jumping on him and he got right in the moms face -2 inches away- like he was trying to kiss her. We felt bad, but it was irritating. So we just hung out and talked and went swimming until 7 when he had to go home for dinner. I had a lot of fun. 
My sister had a shitty day and I feel really bad. First- she quit her job because they were a bunch of assholes. They were gonna punish her and make her work a 8 hour shift on Saturday ( a day she isn't available) and a bunch of other b/s. Jerks.
Second- David Aumiller... thinks I'm hot, not her. I FEEL SO BAD. Uhh. What a jerk. He doesn't like her because she has short hair. He says were both pretty but I'm hot b/c my hair is long and I'm just hot. Its sucky cause I want him to like her. Grr, Boys.
Well, I'm done. I can go out but I want to take a shower first. Jacuzzi's make you feel gross.

I don't know what changed her mind, but its all good. Her friends said a bunch of b/s. So, okay.
Corey says he doesn't care. He laughed. I feel bad, but we didnt do anything wrong... I'm sorry he's my friend.
Remember when I said I wanted a boyfriend?
Yeah, I take that back. Now I don't. Travis wants to ask me out- he told my sister. I'm gonna say no.  Atleast for now. I mean I've only known him a week or two and he's grounded anyway so it's not like I can hang out with him or anything. I can completely have him whipped though. He even admitted it. It's so weird like he would do anything I told him to. I just find it odd. It's kind of cool though. Like-- I wouldn't abuse that like some girls would. He wanted me to go up to the rec while he plays basketball today, but I didn't go. I have to work. I don't know. I just really dont know what I want. Everyone thinks me and him are sooo cute and everyone wants me to like him. I really, at this point, don't know if I do. I mean- I think he is a awesome kid... but I just honestly don't know. Thats why I'm gonna wait until we get a chance to hang out & everything. I don't think that is too much to ask.
School today was funny. Jon, Gabrysh, and I talked to David Aumiller for Shontel. Hahaha. She thinks he is so hot. We were gonna see if he'd go with her to prom, but he isn't going. He said if anything changes he would get back to us. All Gabrysh kept saying is ""Your missing out on sex!"" It was so funny! I mean Shontel probably wouldn't do that, but it was great. We didnt tell him who we were talking about but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. I'm sure he knew. We had the weirdest sub in 5th. He looked like 20 something and he had long black hair. He was sitting there watching the 'Worlds Strongest man' competition and poping a zit directly in the middle of his forehead. It was sick. He was dabbing at it with a paper towel. Uhh it was gross. I got a triple massage from Jordan, Aubrey, and Kori. It was nice. haha.
Today I work 4-7 then me and Katie are hanging out. Should be fun. DAMN IT. It's already 3:20 which means I've got 10 minutes until I have to get ready for work. Quitting would be so much fun.
Later."

All I know is I don't understand girls and I am one of them.
Seriously.
Lets see. I guess I flirt with peoples boyfriends.Mollie and Drew get in fights about me all the time. I guess Mollie says me and him flirt all the time. 
We don't.
She doesn't seem to believe it. She wrote me this big letter on friday telling me to back off her b/f and all this b/s. The stupid things is IM FRIENDS WITH HER. So what the fuck. She's like I still want to be friends and blah blah. She told me to save the note and give it back to her so I wouldn't show people and that she would give me back what I wrote back... So I threw it in the garbage. I wrote her back and told her where it was if she wanted it and if she wanted to show the whole world my letter then she could. I didn't show anyone her letter, just because she asked me not to. The reason I got the wonderful letter is b/c she has people watching us in my 6th. Wanna know what I did?? It's horrible.
I sat on his desk! and guess what? We do our homework together in class. Watch out! I'm all over him. It's fucking ridiculous.
I guess people are telling Amy that I like Corey and am obsessed with him. They tell her that we flirt all the time.
You know what? People need to shut the fuck up and mind their own business. It's my personality to be like that. I would never take someones boyfriend. I'm not like that. So just shut up. Really. The only reason anyone is worried is because of other people. Amy isn't mad though. She likes me and Corey told her how things are. I like Amy, so I'm glad she still likes me. It's just Corey is the same way as me-- we come off as flirty-- but we aren't flirting at all.

So last night and today were fun. I went with Ryan, Jay, Katie, Josh, Corey, Krystyn, Troy, Joe, Mike and G. We went to visit Heather at Dairy Queen and me and Ryan and Corey went to see Heather at her house. (Heather and Ryan are ""seeing each other"") People weren't allowed to stay at Katie's so Corey and Ryan spent the night at my house. We went to Blockbuster and rented the Dickie Roberts movie. It was funny. Me and Corey stayed up till like 3:30 cause Ryan fell asleep. I really tried to keep him up too.
Today me and Ryan and Corey went and got checkers and found Troy at his basketball car wash. I saw Austin and Justin there too. Ryan wanted to go to the beach with Kate and all them so we met them all at the car wash and split up. See, I had to work at 3 and Corey wanted to hang out with Amy at 3 so we stayed together. We went swimming. First at these apartments which had freezing cold water. He threw me in... it sucked. I pushed him in though, so it was even. Then we snuck into the milpond pool/jacuzzi. The pool is heated :) It was so nice there. So we hung out for a couple hours and then headed home. I got sunburned too! Sweet deal. Maybe I wont be as pale. Haha. Maybe not.
Work was same as usual. Jina is back. That's all I'm going to say on that subject.
Jen let me have a hour break to eat with my grandma and visit my relatives that are down from Vermont. It was nice of her- surprisingly. I told my grandma I was going to prom with Travis. She made the biggest deal in the world cause 'I have a date and I never go on dates.' Haha. I love her. It was the last day to see my Aunts and Uncles, which sucks, but I'll see them next year.
Well, I have homework- so I'm going to attempt to do that. We'll see how that goes.

Nothing interesting happened really. Travis carried me to 6th period... and the whole class outloud talked about us. Jeff started it. I'd hit him, but it wouldn't hurt him since he's a football player and gets hit all the time. Trust me, I've tried. lol. He's awesome though. Even Mrs Catton got in on the convo. It was weird.

-Got to school on time! For the first in a long time. Believe me.
-Left school in 1st period.
I woke up this morning feeling really sick to my stomach. I just layed there all class and didn't do my work... So, I called and went home. Ask Brian and Mike- I was no fun.
-Slept. It wasn't nice sleep though, it was feeling gross sleep.
-My Mom brought me McDonalds. At the time= yuck.
-Travis called me. I still don't know what I think about him. The situation sort of sucks. We're so different. I just don't know what I want. I'm going to call him tonight though. He told me to, so I will. I'm trying. The ring tone for my # on his phone... thats right, linkin park. :)
-Made my hair appt. 2:00 @ Mane Event. I might change it to around Kate's appt time though.
-Lena came over. We were suppost to meet Krystyn and Kate at Howard Park. We get there and see them on the strip, so we had to turn around. By the time we got there they were gone! We tried to catch them but we couldn't. Neither of us had a cell so it sucked. I didn't really care though. It was cold and we could of stayed if we wanted to.
-Went to this pool/jacuzzi I can get into. I TOLD MY FRIENDS A MILLION TIMES TO GO WITH ME AND THEY WOULDN'T. Well, they finally did and thought it kiked ass. The pool was 82, it was nice. The jacuzzi was really hot, but it was good considering the cold outside. Thats a big ""I told you so"" from me to them.Krystyn wants to go again. It was a lot of fun.
-Went to 3 in 1 and Wendy's. I swear everyone showed up at Wendy's at the same time as me. First: Mike O'toole, Ryan Kiernan, and Steve Schultz. Then Brugger, Chad, and Dan. Plus when I walked in Toni was working and Amber was there. Krystyn, Josh, Jason, and Kate met me at Wendy's and Steve D and Stuart were there. It was neat.
Now, I'm home. I could be at Walmart with Kate and all them, but I didn't want to go. I still don't feel good from this morning. Plus I need a shower... pool chemicals. Yuck.
Night everyone."

It's always fun to try something new. It was like a big spaghetti party for the whole class. Mr Stobb's= one of the best teachers... ever.
Guess what? Meghan Yopp invited me to go in her limo with her and Ricky for Prom. She was SO nice about it... seriously, it made my day. I don't even have to pay anything. I was surprised. I mean, usually Meghan doesn't talk to me that much. She isn't mean to me, she is nice, but we usually don't stop and talk to each other. I would, but we don't see each other. It was so cool though. Thanks Meghan, if you read this. :)
I also bought my Prom ticket in lunch- so I am 100% going.
Now I just have to make my hair appt ( I tried today but the place I want didn't answer) and get my dress altered (Im too tiny).
Work today: 4:30-7:30. Not to bad, I guess. I hate 3 hour shifts though, they take forever it seems. 
After work I met everyone at Denny's. It was me, Krystyn, Josh, Katie, Mike, G, Corey, Amy, and Jason. It was nice for all of us to go somewhere. I never get to go because my whole life is spent working. Went back to Katie's afterwards. Corey was messed up on pills. His wisdom teeth are coming in and were hurting him really bad. So, he got a couple pills from G and took just one. He's never taken anything before... so he was messed up. He kept stealing stuff from Katie's room and hiding it in his pockets- it was funny.
Tommorrow is my day off. :) Finally! Lena is coming over as soon as I get out of school and we are going to the beach. I'm glad out of all the friends I used to have, we are still friends. She's such a sweet girl and I have so much fun with her. Really. We always find something to do. So, I'm looking forward to that.
Hopefully this weekend we can go to Katie's and drink. I'm just in the mood for it. I never do anymore, and I want to.  Katie's going to see if her mom will let us like she used to. I hope she does. Plus this weekend I might go to the beach with T.J. He invited me, so if I don't have to work I will definitely go. :)
I found something out today... Travis likes me. I think it is kind of cool though. Like, I might think about it. SO many people would talk though. I mean- we'd look ridiculous together. He's 6'6 or 6'7. He is without a doubt the tallest kid I have ever met. I'm 5'1. I'd look so idiotic, I know it. I'm not shallow though. I'm not going to blow someone off because they're really....really.....really tall. He's really sweet. I think he is a awesome guy. So, fuck everyone who would talk. It's not like I ever cared before, so I won't start now. I'm not even sure if I like him yet, so I will see. Hey atleast with Travis no one would stalk me anymore... :) I know he'd stick up for me-- he'd be scary as hell too. That's always effective. Well, I'm off to bed.
Night kids."

Thursday: School, hung out with Domenica.
Friday: Spiff's field trip. I brought a pillow, and while we were waiting for the bus I hit all my friends with it. :) We got the nicest bus w/ air conditioning, movies, etc compared with the astro buses everyone else got. We had to pay more though. Anyways-On the bus I hung out with Joe, Jordan, Jeff, Mike, and a couple other people. We got to watch Pirates of the Carribean, which has Orlando Bloom in it, so I was happy. Inside Spiffs was fun. I ate the exact same thing I did there last year... but it's okay. Egyptian food is good! We met up with Stephanie outside of the buses and I hung out with her most of the time. Steph is awesome! Seriously I had a lot of fun hanging out with her. Bren was there, all she talked about was how people hated her so it was annoying. I don't know, she's not my favorite person. Steph bought this cool little snake for her brother b'day and we basically just walked around and looked at stuff. After that I left school and hung out with Krystyn. I was suppost to go with Oriana though. 
Went to the mall met up with Krysta and her friend.
Bought new sandalias.
Went to Chasco w/ my whole little group. Mike won me a stuffed tiger. :) This girl Jessica was puking by us. That wasn't pretty.
Spent the night at Katie's. Me and Ryan and Troy slept in the spare bedroom. Josh came in and scared the hell out of me. We heard Josh yell a little while later, so umm... we were wondering what was going on w/ him and Katie. I got out of the room and went to their door but he just said something weird that I don't think I heard right so I wont write it.
Troy let me sleep on him (with pillows!) cause I couldn't sleep. I had accidentally fell asleep on him earlier, so laying on him helped me go back to sleep. He's really uncomfortable cause he's so skinny. haha.

Saturday: work.(2-9) I got to work in the bakery! I helped Joe out, it was so much fun. I wrote on a cake, helped customers, made labels, and did inventory. It was cool. I got to take over for Joe when he went on break (b/c Mr Tucker saw me helping with the cake earlier). Joe just came back to the bakery and helped me off the clock. I know a bunch of people have a problem with him, but I don't care. He is nice once you get to know him -he's just obnoxious at times. I don't know... A lot of my good friends dislike him, but he didn't ever do anything to me. I just can't dislike someone for no reason. I was the only one with a chasco shirt. I was unique- yay. Mr. Tucker told me he thinks I was the only one who bought one. Go figure.
Josh Matz called me twice. We're suppost to hang out before he leaves. I'm gonna miss him, even now.
I saw Chris (the kid from the points class) at the mall. It turns out he is Krysta's best friends ex boyfriend. I know Natalie (Krysta's best friend)a little and Krysta was telling me about the situation. It was weird. The kid I had heard about I actually met. I didn't even put the two together either. I think he's nice! Krysta, however, knows the whole deal and I guess he has done some messed up things. I don't know. He still cool though :)
Went to Chasco again. I got carried around by Corey the whole time. haha. Courtney saw me and was like ""Jess what are you doing?!?"" It made me laugh. Corey gave me some good news too. I'm not going to write about it cause I don't want to jump ahead of myself. Oh, Matt's friend Jeff= really pretty.

Sunday: work.(1:30-8:30)Ate dinner at my grandma's on break. Mmm. After work- home. I'm too tired to leave. I was suppost to go with Amanda Potter, but I just want to sleep.
My whole weekend was spent at work. I swear it didn't even feel like a weekend. I think I'm going to skip Tuesday and have a entire day off. It sounds good to me. I can't take their schedules much longer... I can't wait for spring break.
Alright, I'm going to sleep. Night."

I'm sick of always being by myself. I'm sick of work. I'm sick of never having any time for myself. I'm sick of having bills. I'm sick of caring about anything. I wish I was free, cause I don't feel that way at all. My life is run by little details. ""Our lives are frittered away by detail""-- I think thats a Emerson or Hawthorne quote-- and I think it describes me. I spend so much time working to maintain the possesions that I think are so important. The important thing is to enjoy you're life, cause it's the only one you've got. I'm not enjoying my life spending all of it for other people. Right now it's for my teachers or bosses, either way I'm not doing it for me. I hate it. I don't look forward to anything anymore because I've got no time for it. I have 1 hour to myself today. One. Thats fucking ridiculous. What can you do in one hour before work? Not much. This weekend my schedule sucks. Sat:2-9 and Sun:1:30-8:30. Thats after working Sun-Thursday 5 hour shifts atleast each day and school. I swear work never gives me a break. Would it kill them to give me one weekend day off every once and a while?? Of course. I could even deal with a easy 3 hour shift on a Saturday... that will never happen. I really hate being by myself lately too. Like relationship wise. I choose to be single, yes I know. It's not like I couldn't have a boyfriend. I want one though. Just not any of the ones who like me right now. The guy I like acted like something was going to happen w/us (things he said to me and other people) and then went out with another girl. What the hell is that? I don't even feel bad about it, it just sucks. I never like anyone who likes me and I was actually excited about him. Well, thats done with cause even if they break up and he changes his mind I don't want to be a second choice.
Oh well, I just want a good change... I want to be really happy. Just for a little."

This stupid fucking bitch of a lady yelled at me at work. I was talking to my friend Ryan whos a bagger. I asked him if this hot kid who was the customer before used to work at the store. I was sure he did, and I told him the story why. (he used to come into arby's in his uniform and talk to me) This lady starts fucking yelling about how rude I am and how rude Ryan is and how we are telling our personal lives when we should be paying attention to her. Thats all she kept saying, over and over. She's literally yelling. The look on my face must of been priceless. I was so mad I wanted to cry. I mean there was nothing I could do, she wouldn't even let me talk. I tried. So, then she went and got Jennifer and complained about me.(Jen=manager) So, Jen called me over all pissed off...
I went off. I guess the lady completely changed what I actually said. Jen didn't even tell me what she said. She said I was being personal. I was like its not like I was like hey Ryan, what are you doing tonight? Me, oh I'm gonna do that kid who came through the line before. I told Jen I was nothing but nice to that lady, I even added for her so she could get the 25 cash back for checks. I suck at math! I started conversation. Everything you're suppost to. If I showed her a little disrespect she doubled it back by yelling at me in front of a store of customers. Jen seemed to understand where I was coming from, but you never really know with managers. I was so mad... I'm still mad. It ruined my night, I just wanted to leave- or run in the parking lot and tell her off. Either one. I don't understand why there are people like that- out to bring people down. I'm 16, give me a break if I'm not a complete professional.
Other then that... School was interesting. This kid got arrested in front of half the school. It was crazy. He pulled the fire alarm during A lunch. It worked out great for the B lunch people (me!) but the A lunch people got jipped. They didn't extend their lunch because it was club day and already extended. Plus everyone in line had to get out. My sister got food taken out of her hand, and then had to get to the end of the line. I found Alli though! I jumped over a bush to get to her. I miss her. How can you not miss Alli?? Lol. 
I can't think of anything else to write. So, I'm going to hang out with Katie.

Stuff we did: Made ice cream sundaes w/ chocolate ice cream and syrup, watched a ghost chaser show (which was stupid), and went driving in the rain. It was raining on one side of his neighborhood and not the other. We thought it it was neat, so we drove around twice just to make sure. lol.
I always have fun with Brian, he's the best guy ever. He's one of my best friends, if not my best friend. Damn straight.
Today school was okay. I was angry. I hate feeling that way... but things with a certain person are just... pissing me off. I can't help getting mad when he is around. 
I got my grades today: A,B,B,B,B,D. Looks pretty good till you get to the end. All those classes are honors too... except for the D. I REALLY CAN'T DO MATH. It's a 60.1 BARELY a D. I'm taking Probability and Statistics next year to cover up my horrible math grade this year. Atleast the class is easy and Krysta and T.j. are going to take it with me.
Brian came over after school. We made a trip to the post office where both of us really didn't know what we were doing. We mailed Emily the cutest present though. It's a little stuffed animal rhino. It was so cute. Brian had me fill out the envelope to trick her. It says from: Ty Rhino and my address. (ty for ty beanie baby) On the inside he has a little card that says "" I rhino you're thinking about me"". Hahaha. It's so corny and cute. Emily is awesome, I hope she likes it. It's just one of the cute little things Brian does for her. Other then that we watched t.v till I had to go to work.
Work was alright. I got to block for a little while with Amanda, which was fun. Joe got pissed at us cause we were talking about how hot one of the guys that works there is. He was seriously mad! Basically I spent the whole day with Devin though. He bagged for me most of the day and we had break together. I had break with Amanda too, so it was fun. Now, I'm home. Yay! The only part that isn't nice is that I have to start this stupid routine all over again tommorrow. I never have any time for myself anymore and it's frustrating. I just need a break.
2 WEEKS. Spring Break. I cannot wait, cause I need it. Atleast the summer will be easier for me.
Night everyone."

"event","I called Greg and he didn't answer his cell phone. I hope he got to work alright.
Work was completely boring. I had nothing to do. I taught Rob and Scott how to cashier (they're baggers). They scanned for me and typed in the money and stuff. Wow did they suck. Haha. It was cool though, it took away the boredom. I was so bored that I organized my coupons. Then this really hot guy came in and he was telling me about how he just got back from Spring Break in the Bahamas. He'd been back for 2 hours. He's like ""you can't tell?? I look so scruffy."" He looked good. lol. What did I tell him?? I told him I organized my coupons! I was like ""I wish I went to the Bahama's I'm so bored that I organized my coupons.""
Moron Moron Moron.
He looked at me like I was insane. He laughed, but still. Who says that to a hot guy? Me. I sounded like such a complete loser. haha. Oh well, whatever. He comes in a lot, so I guess I'll have to sound less loser-ish next time he comes in.
Lately I sound boycrazy... Have you noticed it? I don't like it.
I have nothing substancial to write about... Boring.
Alright, I'm done.
Goodnight."

"event","Greg and Mike got in a accident today. I'll tell the story...
We (being g,mike,greg,nick,ryan,troy,marvin,krystyn,tyler etc) were all headed on our way to Krystyn's house to meet up. We were going go to the beach to play football in the rain. Well, Greg was going to fast around a turn and went over a median. He was on one side, went through all the bushes and then crashed on the other. I got a call just as I was walking out the door about it. I was worried because I was told they hit a tree. When I got there Tyler, G, Mike and Greg were there. Tyler came was behind them I think. Then Troy, Marvin, and Ryan came. Troy got pulled out of the shower so he had a towel and basketball shorts on. haha. To sum it up everyone was okay and Greg's car is messed up, but not horribly. The cops were nice, they didn't give Greg a ticket.
So today I- went to the accident, went to Greg's, went to Amanda Potter's, went to the beach for a little (swung on the swings), and went to Denny's. Me, Mike, and Ryan ended up going to Denny's cause we were hungry. My mom was there... she gave me $ for my lunch which was awesome. We had so much food... ahh. Plus these nice ladies gave me a coupon for a free dinner cause she heard us trying to find the cheapest meal for Mike.(he only had $5) Now I'm home until I go to work. It is SO NICE to just sit here. I never get to relax anymore.
I have to bring Greg to work today though. We both go in at 5 and he works at the place right down the street from my house. So, since he has no car I told him I would take him. It's kind of out of the way for me to get him, but I'm just nice like that I guess. I wasn't going to leave him stranded.
Well, I'm going to go take a shower.

"event","The class this morning wasn't too bad at all.
I met this guy named Chris there and we hung out the whole class. He goes to River Ridge and... he's cute.We were both locked outside when we got there- so we were trying to figure out how to get in. Thats how we met and started talking. I was like 'okay, you're sitting by me' when we got inside. We wrote notes back and forth talking about how boring the class was. It was so easy though! The instructor cut a hour off the class. Instead of getting out at 1 it got out at 11:55. Sweet deal. He was really nice. Plus the last 15 minutes he showed us different scenarios with toy cars. That along with the movies, asking us each how we got our tickets and all our names and nicknames, a worksheet, and the 2 breaks we got made the class go by fast. Plus I dont have any more points! Yay! Well I still have the 8 from last year... but thats old news. Down side: I cannot get pulled over AT ALL for the next year. My license gets suspended if I do. I'll have 11 or 12 points... considering if the ticket is 3 or 4 points or not. No more speeding for Jessie! Well, hopefully.
Right now I'm waiting for Krysta to get back from Mark's. Who knows how long that will take. I'm still not sure what we are doing yet, but it's all good.
Later.

I want to say a special I love you to Stephanie and Alli...

People there with us: Krystyn, Jason, Steve, Dan, Ryan, Sean, Mike, Kory, Joe, Chad, Kristi, Courtney, her friend, Tyler, Steve D, Stewart, Nicole, Augie, the other kid w/them (I forgot his name-- but he was cool!) and ahh... there was just A LOT of people. It was fun though. 
After the beach I went down to dunkin donuts. I hung out with my sister on her break :). She is the best ever. I love her. This guy Mike that works with her is really cute. She doesn't think so though. Hey, he made me a milkshake so its all good. The reason I went down was to get Katie ice cream. I surprised her. This morning she got her tonsils out. So, I stopped by and picked up a couple scoops of her favorite kind of ice cream which is mint chocolate chip. I just showed up at her house with it, and her slippers that I borrowed. She was really happy- so it made me feel nice.
Spent the rest of the night at her house. A lot of people hung out with us. Kory, Ryan, Jason, Krystyn, Travis, Troy, Sean and Mike. Travis and Kory beat me up ALL NIGHT. They pinned me down and tickled me. Travis is 6'5 and Kory is 6'4... IT REALLY SUCKED. Haha. I'd never met Travis before, so it was cool.
Alright, Im going to bed. Gotta wake up at 8:30 for the class. Midnight- 8:30 is a good amount of sleep, I think.

"event","The last two days have sucked.
To start my day off yesterday in 1st one of the scrapes that Ryan made came open. So, I had to walk to the clinic with blood running down my foot. Graphic, I know (sorry). It was pretty to see... not really. I came back to class and Brian had dropped my water and the cap broke in 1/2. Yeah, so big mess and no drink. Then I had to spend a hour or so in Mr. Dewitt's class because of FCAT's. Being in that class for that long makes you have a bad day. He's a moron. He's mad cause I ""decieved him"". We were hungry so I kept trying to get passes out to get stuff from the cafeteria vending machines. It pissed him off I guess. I don't even care. I told him to prove it when he writes me up. lol. I'm sure he'll forget, he's not the brightest crayon in the box. Ashley and me just can't stop laughing at him. She makes the jokes about him that are hillarious. Ashley was trying to see if she could sneak me out of the window in his bathroom. Hahaha. It's just- we cant help it. He always spills stuff all over himself, slurs his words, and leans into the drivers ed cars like a hooker. Anyone would find him funny. Then 6th I had to take a math test. After that I spent the whole afternoon with Lena. It was fun... we watched movies and went to Wal-mart and went to a sub place and got Gyros. I've never had lamb before... :( All I kept saying was ""I'm eating a baby lamb"". Haha. I felt bad! So, atleast the afternoon was good.
Today sucked even worse then yesterday. I got some news that made my day bad. Guy stuff. Blah. It's fine though, it was nothing that I didn't expect really. Plus Alan told me today that Kim Delaney plans on starting shit with me at Prom. She was saying stuff about me, Stacie, and Kristyna. I guess she is going with someone named Brian Lomax? Things with her are so stupid. I don't mess with her, I don't see why she has to with me and my friends. I mean I'm not going to her Prom and doing anything. I'm not this cruel mean person that she sees me as. If she has to hold a grudge atleast tell me now, instead of at Prom. She can do what she wants, she never has bothered me before. I'm just sick of it... get over it, I have. I don't like holding grudges. I mean I don't like her--but everyone has their opinions and are entitled to them. That's life. Just don't listen or let them get to you, I guess. If she could do that we wouldn't of had this problem in the first place though. To her I'm a big bully. Fine by me if its your opinion :). On the flip side I did get a 80 on my science test and I only work 4-7. Yay.
I have the next 2 days off from work! Yes! (Well, I should cause I asked for them off. We'll see)
Friday: I'm suppost to go to Ashley Hague's birthday party. It's at the Ramada Inn. I'm a little worried that it's going to get raided though. Hopefully not. I haven't decided to go or not yet.
Saturday: I've got that driving school class to take till one. After that me and Krysta are hanging out. I'm not sure what we are doing yet, but we always have fun. I'm looking forward to it.

Haha, just kidding.
Today & yesterday were really boring. Yesterday the most exciting thing I did was draw on a etch-a-sketch with Mike  in 1st...Does that tell you anything?? Today I had a bunch of tests and stuff. So Exciting.
I'm not going camping anymore. I've got to take that class to get the points off my license. The only day I can is Saturday. So, no camping. Plus Felicia and Lisa are going and I just don't want to put up with them, to be honest. I mean it's sad that best friends now dislike each other, but I can't do anything about that. Kyle really wanted me to go, and I feel bad, but I HAVE to go to that class. Otherwise, I think I would of stuck it out and hung out with Kyle, Richie, Jon, Drew, and Zac. I'll go next time though. If there is a next time. lol.

I went with Kate, Josh, Troy, Ryan, Krystyn, Jay etc... the people I'm most usually with. Went to Troy's and Kate's. I went online at Kate's to talk to Oriana and saw the weirdest thing in Zach's info. It said how he luvs me and has never felt this way about anyone before and won't about anyone else and it ended with the quote from Story Of The Year ""until the day I die, I'll spill my heart for you."" I DEFINITELY need to ask him about that. Lets hope it was... a misunderstanding? How can you misunderstand that though? Lets just go with a misunderstanding for now. Lets see what else? Krystyn is pissing me off, but thats okay I guess. She's a hypocrite. Thats all I'm going to say on the subject. I left her and Kate early, cause I was annoyed with her, and she got mad. So, I went to Brian's to surprise him. I promise I will never surprise him again! Lol. He came to my house at around 1 ( 20 mins after my surprise) and we hung out for like a hour. It was cool.
Today was work. All day work. My shift was 1:30-8, which kind of sucked, but what can you do. I got a hour break and went to my grandma's for dinner. My Aunt Roberta and Uncle Donald are down so we all ate together. It was nice, but I wish I could of gotten to visit for longer. They leave really early Tuesday morning. Work has kept me from spending any real time with them. Tommorrow I've got school and work from 4:30-9 or 9:30, so there isn't any real time to visit them. It sucks. Work was basically the same as always. The stalker didn't come in today! That's good thing. I got yelled at in the parking lot by some guys though. When I walked by they were like ""hey hottie"". It was okay though, cause they looked cute. I guess thats better then a creepy group of guys. Sort of.Krystyn and Kate are coming over. Kate just called and told me not to leave, so I won't. Hmm...I'm done posting- what a pointless journal. Night."

"event","The concert last night was the best... ever. No doubt about it. 
Highlights: we snuck down to the closest we could get without our tickets getting checked-which was really close. Got caught by the cops 4 times... but we kept coming back. All you have to do is hide behind some people, and they lose you after a while. Lol.
I jumped off a balcony! There was a balcony and underneath was this walkway and there was a ramp that led right next to the walkway and Chester was walking up to get on it. So, I jumped off the balcony which was like a 8 ft drop and then ran to the edge. He was RIGHT THERE. It was bad ass. Yeah, I sound like a crazed fan, but I don't care. Chester is worth it. At the end of the concert Linkin Park pretended they were done playing and I didnt think they were done and neither did Kate... I even asked a attendant and she said no, they're done. So, we went to walk out the doors ( we were at the doors) and I heard them come back... I ran SO FAST. Haha. I got right back to where I was too. When I got to my spot, he was looking right at it sitting on a speaker... he sang all of My December facing that way. :) He was so pretty. They played 3 more songs, which was awesome. All the bands were amazing. I knew almost all the songs that every band played, which made it so much better. The guy from Hoobastank is really hot, I never realized it. A guy in Story of The Year was too. Haha. But I wasn't checking them out or anything...:) Of course Chester was the all time best, even my sister admitted he was hot. What now?? Haha. Mike Shinoda came within like 10 feet of me and Kate too. He was awesome, he kept coming on that ramp that I told you about, and he stood on the railing so he was really close. It was the greatest concert.
The day before the concert....
I skipped school. Ahh. Krysta, Krystyn, Kate, Jason McDonald, Sean, Ryan Josh and Nick Spiker came with us. It was fun. I took some pictures with my camera. The suckiest thing happend. I got so scraped up ( right before my concert too!) I was chasing Ryan down the strip and he moved and accidentally knocked me and i just flew and skidded across the concrete. I have scratches everywhere... like really bad ones. Everyone told me to sit down and stuff- they were all really nice. Josh even put gause on my knee. Lol. My toes all tore up, and my knee on the other leg is all tore up, so I am walking like a moron. Plus I have scrapes on different parts of my legs and ankles and one on my side. It hurts. It's alright though, I'm a soldier. Haha. I even had krystyn take pictures of it. 
Today I had to work. I have a hour break from work right now, which is how I am typing all of this.
I just got chased by my stalker.... Not fun. I saw him at the end of my line with flowers and stuff. I was suppost to be on break already (I was 10 mins late) and Amanda was suppost to be blocking. Instead of blocking we turned off my light and Amanda said she'd finish ringing up my customers, cause she loves me.lol. So he got to her and she was ringing him up and he asked where I was. So, she was like... um shes done, shes home. He saw me hiding in the office though, so he waited by the doors. Amanda Matt and Brett told me and said to run upstairs. So, I did. Zach was up there, so I waited a minute and had him walk me to my car. So, where was the guy? Oh yeah, in the parking lot. I saw him in my rear view mirror when I was talking to Zach and he was walking up to my car.  So, I left REALLY FAST. I told the guy to stop buying me stuff, he won't listen. Seriously, it's getting out of hand and needs to stop. When I am hiding and running at my own job, thats enough. He's a psycho.
Anyways- Tonight I think I am going to Katie's or I am calling Nick Slone and were going to a party, or I'm calling Krysta. One of those. Unfortunately I still have to go back to work and stay until 8:30. I clocked out 16 mins late though, so I don't have to leave for another 5 minutes to get there at 6:46 sharp. That means I only have to work a Hr and 45 mins :)

It is 2 days until the best concert ever, and I am going. Plus I got off early from Publix so I have time to write for once.
Linkin Park, P.o.d, Story of the Year, and Hoobastank. March 5th... I'm there. :)
Anyone who knows me, knows what a completely huge deal this concert is for me. It's so bad ass. Yay. It's like me saying ""Hey Chester, I'll see you on friday"" and I really will! Haha. Sweet deal. Other then that things with me are really different. I don't hang out with a lot of people that I used to, which is sad, but good in the end. It was a needed change for the most part. I've been hanging out with Kate and Krystyn a lot. They're awesome, and we've made a lot of new friends hanging out together. We made like a new little group. I work at Publix now. It's going really good there. I have made a lot of new friends there too, mainly from Mitchell. Plus I make pretty good money and I just got a raise. Unfortunately I have this guy who is, for lack of a better word, stalking me. He brings me flowers all the time, cards, and he got me this wooden carving that says 'Jessica'. He's so creepy. He comes through my line EVERYDAY. My friends John and Scott are getting really mad.  When they see him they both plan on telling him to back off but he seems to always come before they are at work. Scott gets so mad, he missed the guy by 5 mins and looked for him. John's gonna say he's my boyfriend. The guy asked me if he could buy me more flowers today, and I told him he couldn't buy me anything anymore. I hope that he stops. It's scary. He looks at my day schedule sometimes and it makes me nervous because he knows when I am going to be leaving the store.
I'm suppost to go camping again the weekend after this one. It's a 4 day weekend, so we're staying 3 days. Same place, same campsite, same party basically. Haha. It should be fun. I'm lucky it's not this weekend, I've got to take a class to take points off of my license. I now have... 11! Damn, I know. I won't get my license taken away because 8 of them were over a year ago. Lucky. Unfortunately I've got a 4 hour class to take Saturday. I got a speeding ticket. It sucks. My ticket is $121.00. I don't know if I could of got out of the ticket, Brian was there and he was making me laugh, so I'm sure the cop didn't like that. Oh well I guess. Atleast now I watch my speed a little bit more.
Josh Matz is moving away, I found out the other night. I think it's sad. I mean, I know we tried the whole deal with us and it didn't work out... but we're still friends and I want him to stay. Within the next month he's either back in the airforce or in New Hampshire. :( I need to hang out with him before he leaves. I guess he's having a leaving party and I'm invited. Of course, I'm his muffin. Kidding.
 Yeah, I started talking to Josh Hensley again. What a moron was I. Were not talking anymore... so anyone who knows how things with me and him were would be proud. This time though, it was different. I wasn't the one pursuing. It was a really nice change. He called me, took me places and paid and it was just... a complete change. Didn't last long though. We'll still be friends, he is a cool kid. Thats all I want. With all the things he has done, sometimes it seems he doesn't really deserve a good status, but he honestly is a fun guy... for a friend. I'm happy with that. Right now I'm not sure whats going on with me and guys. I don't even know what I want. A lot of the guys at work like me, or have liked me but there is no one there for me. There is one person (not at work) but I don't know what's going on with him. Sometimes I just feel like I'd be wasting my time but then other times I don't at all. It's a weird situation... I guess I'll just have to see. :) I'm in no rush.
Tiffany Stanjeski said the nicest thing to me the other day. She told me even though she hasn't talked to me in a while that she thinks I have grown up a lot and that I am so pretty. I thought it was so sweet and it made my day. :) It's nice when one thing can make your whole day... that did it. Just like Amber Wyley telling people how I was so sweet and so pretty. It's just nice people like that. 
Okay, now that I have said that, I think I'm done. If anyone actually read this entire thing... You're crazy. Its one that even I know is too long to read.

Then me and Jess went to her house and to Drew's. It was fun at Drew's. Josh was there. We played Yahtzee and outburst and stuff like that. I didnt like outburst though so we just ended up quitting after a round. I got Yahtzee on my first roll. I got 2nd place though cause Drew's losing streak turned around and he got 2 yahtzee's. Josh didnt get any yahtzee's though. Then we played basketball and watched some tv.
I was still in a bad mood today. I have a lot on my mind and it always seems to be worse in the mornings. Way worse. I think its because your mind has all night to dwell on it. Stupid sleep, I'll avoid it for the next few days. Kidding, I'd collapse without sleep. I hate how your bad moods carry over. Happy moods never carry over to new days, but bad moods always do. Figures. I have this theory that god enjoys watching me be unhappy. Its like a fun torture game to give things to me and take them away. When I accept a change (I dislike change) He changes it again. Its fun to watch me watch others have what I want. Oh yeah, its not perfect for them either I realize this, but atleast they aren't always messed with. Maybe I'm just a interesting person and it's fun and then when I finally am happy (ie: when I am boring to mess with) then I'll be really happy and grateful for it. Fuck that. Life is unfair and the only people who realize it are the people at the bad end of the deal. Other then that there was a fight with J-ho (Justin for those who don't know) and this one kid that broke out right in front of my desk. That was neat- for a change I actually saw a fight. Not only that but I had the best view of the fight out of ANYONE IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE SCHOOL. Thats right. After that the fire alarm rang and we went to our desginated pole in the front of the school. Consequently everyone was confused because no one knew which pole belonged to us. I found out today my class in Mayer is switched. I am the 1/2 of the class being switched to Coach Quarto. I also found out today that Shontel has Coach Quarto for 2nd and her class now is getting sent to Mrs Harsch. I think I'll switch with her and have Mrs. Harsch. Am I even spelling that right? I have no idea, its been too many years. We'll I'm going to go have fun in my empty house till 7 when I go with Jess.
Later"

"event","I had the worst night last night. I dont even want to type, so this will be short. Who gives a fuck anyway.
Yesterday I had the pizza party, fun. Went and got Fesha and she did my hair. It looks nice. Jess came to see me and my mom sent her to Arby's so we went with her. Went to Winn Dixie and stuff. Josh and Jon came over for a little.
Tennis tournament was canceled cause of rain. I got yelled a 4 million times to add on to my already not so wonderful day. I got points taken off because I let Trisha wear my shoes to play basketball cause I was walking around. I got yelled at for a lollipop. I got yelled at for the gum the lollipop created. I got yelled at for walking with Trisha's sandals off because I almost fell 3 times. I got yelled at for stuff I cant even remember. Then I went to 4th and got hassled for my ID tag.
It never fucking ends.

3 weeks is such a fucking rip-off."

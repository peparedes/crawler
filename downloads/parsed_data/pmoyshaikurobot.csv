"event","Decided to make this a two-parter since it was so painfully long.<strong><br /><br />Person of the Year<br /></strong>OBAMA! My biggest wish for 2008 was that Obama would win Iowa, the primaries, and the general election. Good call 2007 Phil. To think of all the hours/days/weeks/months I&nbsp;spent reading/watching/listening to election coverage... it's kind of ridiculous. If I wasn't a politics junkie I&nbsp;probably could have read ten more novels last year.<br /><br />I'm trying not to set my expectations too high. At some point, Obama is going to really let me down. Already I'm not crazy about the details of the $800-$900billion economic recovery plan. But there's no way I would trust the economy to John&nbsp;McCain. And I'd feel really nervous with Hillary in charge. The truth is it will take a long way to undue eight years of George W. Bush. But I'll be happy if Obama can make some progress towards universal health care and get the country to seriously invest in alternate sources of energy. Also, our relationships with every other country are sure to improve, thank God.<br /><br />Aside from someone like Mayor Bloomberg, I don't think there's a better person to try to get Democrats and Republicans to work together. Even so, I don't holding my breath for the two parties to seriously work together. A&nbsp;lot of people in the GOP&nbsp;would rather just try to oppose what's being done in hopes that something goes wrong and they can say &quot;I told you so.&quot; And until they're ready to wake up and seriously reconsider what their party stands for, this is sadly their best option.<br /><br />Here's to hoping for an Obama miracle.<br /><br /><strong>New Friend Award</strong><br />Amy and Geoff. Really no question about this one. They're our best friends in Boston. Whether we're having a LOST&nbsp;themed party, playing a board game, or just watching a movie, they're always up for a good time.<br /><br /><strong>Best Celebrity Encounter</strong><br />One of my biggest regrets from 2007 was not asking David Bazan to play Big Trucks. Thankfully, that was corrected when I saw David Bazan perform at Brandeis. First off, it was amazing that he played a few miles from my house, for free, in a venue that fit maybe 100 people tops. Usually I think it's kind of annoying to request a song when you're at a concert but I've seen Bazan like three times but never heard him play my favorite Pedro the Lion song. So between songs I&nbsp;kind of just said &quot;Big Trucks&quot; really quietly. But I was maybe ten or fifteen feet away from him, so he heard me and played it &quot;because I&nbsp;asked so sweet.&quot; I also got to ask him about his top five movies, and if he plans to release his cover of &quot;The Man In Me&quot;&nbsp;(the answer is yes). <br /><br /><strong>Best Accomplishments<br /></strong>Coming in second place in my fantasy baseball league and beating Catie's dad at bowling.<br /><br />Oh, and getting a job and moving to Boston. Hmm.. more on this later.<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Biggest Disappointments</strong> <br />When Pappie died. I still have a hard time thinking about it. Things were really rough for a few weeks. I&nbsp;still worry&nbsp;a lot about my Nana and my dad. It really made me wish that I had spent a lot more time with him when I had the chance. The one good thing that came out of it was going home for the funeral. You have to understand that I have a huge extended family on my dad's side. For a few days all we did was hang around Nana's house. I think it brought me closer to some of my aunts and uncles.<br /><br /><strong>What one thing about the past year would you change</strong><br />Probably should have joined more meetup.com groups sooner than I&nbsp;did. I'm really enjoying my bookclub and my writing group. One of these days I&nbsp;need to go to a gaming meetup, because sometimes I&nbsp;just need a 3+ hour boardgame. Hopefully this year I can add a few more local friends to the roster to complete some unmet needs.<br /><br /><strong>Greatest memory of the past year</strong><br />No idea.<br /><br /><strong>Party of the Year</strong><br />LOST&nbsp;Parties 1-3. Desmond and Patchy costumes. Dharma beer. Island chow. LOST&nbsp;marathons. How can you go wrong?<br /><br /><strong>Best LJ Entry<br /></strong>15 Most Meaningful Songs<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Theme of the Year</strong><br />Improvement. My entire life is so much better now than it was last year. I can't let myself forget it. <br /><br /><strong>Quote of the Year<br /></strong>&quot;Maverick.&quot; Though in fairness, the McCain/Palin campaign had so many unbelievable quotes, it's hard to pick just one.<br /><br /><strong>Biggest wish for 2009</strong><br />Motivation. My plan is to apply for MFA programs this year, so that I could start in the fall of 2010. There's a lot that needs to be done before that can happen. Most importantly I&nbsp;need to write some new short stories, and they need to be perfect. Second, I&nbsp;need to take the GRE. Not looking forward to this, seeing as how I've already started studying for this twice and given up twice. Then I&nbsp;need to get recommendation letters, fill out applications, etc etc. The good thing is that Catie and I are doing this together (she's applying to speech pathology programs) so we'll be able to keep each other on task. We've already started narrowing down the programs.<br /><br /><strong>Things to Look Forward To<br /></strong>Vacation coming up in March. We'll be spending seven days in Phoenix and Las Vegas. I've never been to the southwest before, so I'm really excited to do some exploring. Thanks to Catie, we go on a lot of little day trip adventures, but it's been a while since I've done any long distance travelling. We're checking out a few schools while we're there. Not sure how many more Boston winters I can put up with.<br /><br />I can't wait for baseball to start up again. There are some plans to go to a game with Greg in May, and with Josh sometime later in the summer.<br />"

"event","Yeah, this is late. But at least it's thorough.<br /><br /><strong>Best CD<br /></strong>Over the past few months I've wasted a lot of brain power trying to decide which album from the past year was my favorite. It's close, but I think the edge goes to Thao Nguyen and the Get Down Stay Down - We Brave Bee Stings and All. Each one of her songs has is filled with a great, upbeat high-energy, and I don't have enough music like that. <br /><br />On the opposite end of the spectrum is my second ranked album Bon Iver - For Emma, Forever Ago. It's a breakup album I guess. Even though I'm in an extremely happy relationship, I&nbsp;still listened to this album over and over and over. It's heartbreaking.<br /><br />Rounding out the top three would be Ra Ra Riot - The Rhumb Line.&nbsp; This is just a great album. <br /><br />What's great is that a year ago I hadn't even heard of any of these bands, and now they definitely list among my favorites. <br /><br /><strong>Most Disappointing CD</strong><br />There were only two releases I&nbsp;was really looking forward to this year: Tilly and the Wall and The Postal Service. Of course, The Postal Service Record has been postponed until - aw, hell, nobody knows. <br /><br />Deathcab, however, did release an album. I'm tempted to list this as the biggest disappointment for the sole reason that their first single was &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart.&quot; Fucking hate that song. But &quot;...Cath&quot; may be my favorite Deathcab song ever. And I've slowly been listening to the rest of the album. It's growing on me it, a lot like I slowly warmed up to &quot;Plans.&quot;<br /><br />I&nbsp;should probably mention the Tilly album, too. The album had a lot of energy - but interestingly it was a lot of <em>negative </em>energy. &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; is a really awesome track. But overall, it just wasn't the Tilly I&nbsp;loved. A little too dark, too much guitar, too much drumming, not enough clapping and tapdancing.<br /><br /><strong>Best Concert</strong><br />Ra Ra Riot at the Iron Horse in Northampton. The drummer, guitarist, and bass player all looked eerily similar - same doofy haircut and oversized glasses. Then there were was a string section of two pale beauties, a blonde on violin and brunette on bass cello. And a bearded front man with a beautiful voice. It was like a handsome prince leading a band of freaks. Very Tim Burton-esque. It was really high energy, even though some of the songs are painfully sad. Great show.<br /><br /><strong>Worst Concert</strong><br />None. Hotel Cafe Tour, David Bazan and TIlly and the Wall were all good shows.<br /><br /><strong>Best Movies<br /></strong>Looking back, I realize that I&nbsp;saw way too many movies in theatres this year. By my calculations, at least twenty. Living in Boston has given me the opportunity to see so many small releases that I would have missed out on in PA. But despite all that, most of my top movies are very mainstream.<br /><br />1)&nbsp;The Dark Knight. Batman Begins was fantastic, and there was an insane amount of hype leading up to this release. Somehow they managed to exceed all of my expectations.&nbsp; <br /><br />2) In Bruges - This movie had everything: action, love, laughs and first rate drama. Great movie.&nbsp; <br /><br />3)&nbsp;Wall-E. Another big surprise, especially since Ratatouille really&nbsp;let me down last year. Glad to see Pixar bounce back with this.&nbsp;Best robot love story since Short Circuit!&nbsp; <br /><br />4) The Wresler. Great cast. Emotional story. Marissa Tomei's boobs. Awesome movie all around. Still thinking about the ending though.<br /><br />5) Slumdog Millionaire.&nbsp; This movie went from moments of horrifying depression to an ending of pure joy.&nbsp; I went into the theatre without knowing a thing about the movie, and was just blown away.<br /><br />6) Milk. Great story, told perfectly.&nbsp;Maybe this should be ranked higher..<br /><br />7) VIcky Christina Barcelona. This is probably one of Woody Allen's top 10 films, which says a lot considering just how many movies he has made. Penelope Cruz was great in this.&nbsp; <br /><br />8) The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. Really goddamn depressing. <br /><br />9) Synechdoche, New York. This is definitely an imperfect film, and I&nbsp;need to see it again just to make sense of it. But I'm a sucker for Charlie Kauffman movies and despite its flaws, the movie really came together in the end. Something about it definitely touched a nerve with me.&nbsp; <br /><br />10) Cloverfield. A great new way to film a monster movie. It scared the crap out of me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here's a list of all of the 2008 movies I've seen so far&nbsp;(in theatres or on DVD)<br />Baby Mama<br />Be Kind Rewind&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Before the Devil Knows You're Dead&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />The Changeling<br />Cloverfield<br />The Dark Knight<br />The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Doubt<br />Forgetting Sarah Marshall<br />Gone Baby Gone&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />I've Loved You For So Long<br />In Bruges<br />Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull<br />Iron Man<br />Man On Wire&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Persepolis&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Pineapple Express&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Quid Pro Quo&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Rachel Getting Married<br />Sex and the City: The Movie<br />Slumdog Millionaire<br />Smart People&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />Synechdoche, New York<br />Vicky Christina Barcelona<br />Wall-E&nbsp;&nbsp; (DVD)<br />The Wrestler<br />The X-Files: I Want to Believe<br />Milk<br />Happy Go Lucky<br />The Curious Case of Benjamin Button<br /><br /><br /><strong>Worst Movies<br /></strong>George Lucas and Stephen Spieldberg have made yet another effort to destroy my favorite childhood movie franchises. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was so bad that it offended me. I'll accept the fact that the movie was about aliens. That could have been pulled off. I will not accept Indiana Jones surviving a nuclear blast. Among the other grievances:&nbsp;Shia Labeaof being hit in the crotch while sword fighting on two moving jeeps, Shia Labeof swinging on vines through the jungle with cgi monkeys, cgi ants stealing Indiana Jones' hat, and everyone not only surviving ridiculous waterfalls, but being chased by Nazis down said waterfalls. This movie does not deserve to be recognized as part of the Indiana Jones franchise. Good job Shia, you've been in the shittiest movie two years in a row. I haven't seen a movie this bad since the Planet of the Apes remake.<br /><br />Runner up for most disappointing movie of the year:&nbsp;X-Files I Want to Believe. Jordan summed this up best when he wrote his letter of complaint: &quot;Dear Chris Carter, where are the fucking aliens???&quot; The only good thing that came of this movie is that it encouraged me to watch some old episodes in the series. Man, what a great show.<br /><br />One more notable letdown: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I was really in love with the trailer, and thought it could end up being my favorite movie of the year. I realize that this had the same writer as Forrest Gump, but that's not a valid excuse for this to be little more than a cheap knock off. Forrest Gump had a lot going for it:&nbsp;hilarious script, great soundtrack, complicated characters, and a&nbsp;lot of heart. Brad Pitt's character had no developement other than the fact that he was aging in reverse. There really wasn't much of a plot aside from Brad Pitt traveling the world meaning somewhat quirky characters. The love story fell flat because that girl was a bitch. Also, there was absolutely no need to include Hurrican Katrina in this movie. The more I&nbsp;think about this movie the more it angers me. And how on earth did Pitt get an Oscar nomination for this? You want to see him in a great movie that's along these same lines, watch Legends of the Fall.<br /><br /><strong>Best Books</strong><br />This year I&nbsp;tried to read more novels. My favorite was &quot;Look at Me&quot; by Jennifer Egan. I'm really upset that I didn't get to see her speak at AWP. Other great novels: World According to Garp, The Brief Wondrous Life of&nbsp;Oscar Wao, and The Abstinence Teacher. Best nonfiction:&nbsp;Another Bullshit Night In Suck City. Best Anthology&nbsp;:&nbsp;Best of Tin House (short stories).<br /><br /><strong>Best TV Shows</strong><br />I'd have to say my favorite show this year has been How I Met Your Mother. It's just everything a comedy should be. Reminds me a lot of Ed. Kind of wacky, very romantic, good characters and emotional storylines. Big Bang Theory has been really funny too. Great to have a mainstream show make so many ridiculously nerdy references.<br /><br />Goes without saying that LOST is amazing. Mad Men also has me hooked.<br /><br />"

"event","With the Olympic games now just days away, I can't help but be extremely bothered by the fact that they are being held in China. Yes, this is the most populous nation in the world, and yes they were cheated out of the 2000 games when they lost selection by two votes - two votes that turned out to have been bought. Even so, there are just too many reasons why China does not deserve the Olympic games. 

While transforming itself into an economic powerhouse, the Chinese government has destroyed the surrounding environment. Sure, this is their choice, and most Chinese are very happy with the influx of money, and newfound individual economic power. But decades from now, when asthma and cancer rates are through the roof, fish and wildlife have been destroyed, the only thing they'll have left is a surplus of over-polluting factories. Only then will they realize that they didn't really have a choice but to live with the most polluted air in the world; the government was going to do that whether the people liked it or not.&nbsp; The Ethiopian world record holder for the marathon has decided to run a shorter distance because of the damage the air will do to his lungs. Athletes from America and other countries are planning to wear breathing masks up to the last moment before their events begin. Until then they're trying to find ways to do their pre-event training indoors. 

Their One Child Policy has encouraged sex selective abortion, and scewed (sp?) their sex ratio. Government policy penalizes public officials who do not curb policy growth. So while not officially endorsed by the government, this policy encourages lower level officials to force sterilization and abortion. 

The People's Republic of China continues to control its citizens by denying freedom of speech and freedom of the press. International reporters have recently discovered that their internet access will be limited during the Olympic events, despite past promises that they could cover the games in whatever way they saw fit. Now, a google search for ""Tipet"" will be restricted. Finding unrestricted access to the internet is extremely difficult for ordinary citizens, and the country continues to do everything it can to restrict access to information from the outside world.&nbsp;

The other day I saw a report on the legacy of Chairman Mao. All over China there are still giant statues and portraits of Mao, along with art, jewelry and coins in his image. A new biography was just released, written in Chinese, but is censored in China because it tells the truth about what he did (ie, not the state sanctioned history). Thirty years after his death they are still using propaganda to promote his greatness. This is the man responsible for the Great Leap Forward, which led to millions of Chinese starving to death, probably the largest famine in world history. After that there was the Cultural Revolution. Afraid of being forced out, he empowered the Red Guards creating social and economic chaos. Schools were closed, people were wrongly imprisoned and hundreds of thousands were killed. And Mao is still celebrated as a great man!

Perhaps most relevant to the outcome of the games are the ways that China treats its athletes. The government is determined to come out with the most medals, and has essentially created athlete factories, taking children from a very young age and training them from a very young age. NPR has done spent a lot of time covering this story. Many young athletes are pushed too hard, and face crippling injuries. Others (MOST) simply come to the end of their training at a level that is not high enough to compete on the world stage. In either case, these athletes are thrown aside by the government, offered no compensation and left without an education, since they have opted to join these athletic academies, leaving no time for schooling. Even former medal winners have been pushed to the point of injury, left with nothing, and forced to sell their medals for cash. This sort of Olympian factory goes against the spirit of the games.&nbsp;

How does this even bolster your international image? Who won the most medals in the 2006 Olympics? I have no idea. I'm sure most people wouldn't know. (just checked. it was Germany.) I don't think that people of the world feel any sort of profound respect for Germany. They don't really care. Winning the most gold medals won't get you any more respect when you're oppressing your own people, and enabling genocide in Darfur. Oh, and did I mention Tibet? The point is: Olympic victory is temporary!&nbsp;

Athletes were forced to sign agreements stating that they will not make political remarks against China or the games, in order to prevent incidents like the Black Power Salute at the 1968 Summer Olympics. The idea of awarding the Games to China was that the world spotlight would foster positive change, the way that the 88 games advanced Korea's transition to democracy. But history has shown that regimes have used the Olympics to increase nationalism and become stronger, as the Nazis did. Once the games end, the attention is gone. That's why it's so important that the media and the athletes do everything they can to highlight the atrocities being committed by the Chinese government, to force reform while they can, and let the Chinese people know that they deserve better.

If this doesn't happen, then the only thing to come out of the Olympics is THE STORY of the first Chinese Olympics. It will get a lot of attention, bring in a lot of viewers and a lot of dollars (or euros or yen or whatever). Beijing will be left with some really cool, interesting architecture, but not much else."

"event","<p>Staying up late to watch the RedSox/Yankees game on a Wednesday night. Life is grand.<br /><br />I gotta say how much I love living in a baseball town. Everytime we go to the bar the game is on and EVERYONE is really into it. We get to see Yankees fans get reamed out on the subway. Dunkin Donuts even has specials for days after the RedSox win. This is happiness.<br /><br />My whole life I've been a huge baseball fan, and now I have the pleasure of living somewhere that is constantly in the baseball state of mind. And the baseball state of mind is very close to the summer state of mind (to me at least).<br /><br />Basketball playoffs are starting soon, and I'm sure that the town will go crazy over that too because the Celtics are crazy good this year after totally sucking for a long time.&nbsp;Maybe I'll even start to like football this year! .... But probably not. The Patriots really turned me off after that whole video scandal.<br /><br />Yes, it's been a while since I posted, so let me assure you that things are going very well. I love my job. I get to paid to learn a lot of really interesting things. And sometimes I have to do really shitty work... but I'm still getting paid a lot better than I was at the hotel, so I don't mind at all. Catie and I have an amazing apartment in Waltham. First of all it's gorgeous. There's plenty of space. We've bought some really nice things and done a pretty good job decorating. All in all, it makes us feel like grownups. It really feels like home. Even better, Catie is learning to be a really great cook. And on nights we're too lazy or hungry to cook, we go out and explore the hundreds of restaurants nearby. We're still exploring the places that are within a block of us: mexican, thai, japanese, korean, african, a brewery, an irish pub, etc etc.&nbsp;<br /><br />Eventually I need to write individual entries about all of these things and post pictures. But for now, just know that things are good. :)</p>"

"event","This year, I'm giving up buying books for lent. I realize that I have a problem. Hopefully this will&nbsp;prevent my library from growing to further monstrous proportions, if only temporarily. AWP weekend can be considered my Fat Tuesday, because I bought more books than I should have, even with Catie's ""don't"" glares keeping me in check most of the time. I've been meaning to read something by Jennifer Egan, so I bought her novel ""Look at Me."" And finally I bought ""Another Bullshit Night In Suck City"" which sounds like a pretty good memoir. Also I found a book of poetry based on female super hero characters. Nice. I think I'll give that one to Ian. On top of that I got a few copies of ""One Story"" magazine, which is really cool. 

The fact that I've held out for this long is surprising. When we were in Boston I spent a day ""shopping"" with Catie, Angie, and her friend Yee. I managed to hang in there for .. oh, two stores. But after that I was sick of looking at clothes. So I spent an hour in Barnes and Noble, and another hour in Borders. It was torture! When Easter comes there will be a feast - a feast of books. I'd really like to get something by Stewart O'Nann. Sal wrote about him in his blog and most of his books sound really good. I'd also like to get something by Dennis Johnson. There are a lot of modern authors who I still haven't explored, and need to. There's a book called ""History of a Bad Year"" that has a really cool structure. It's about an old professor who hires an assistant for dictation and help with his book. Every page of the book is divided into thirds. The top third is the content of the political book being written. The middle third is the professor's thoughts. And the bottom third is the thoughts of the girl. I'm not sure how you actually go about reading that though. It's like reading a really long jump page.&nbsp; 

My obsessive reading habits actually helped me to write a great cover letter to be a researcher at Panel Intelligence. I cast myself an information junkie, always on the lookout for my next fix, and I wanted Panel Intelligence to be my new dealer.&nbsp;Well, it wasn't QUITE that radical, but it was really fun to write&nbsp;a creative cover letter after writing a dozen boring letters.&nbsp; 

I want to channel my obsessive reading more towards reading books, and writing short stories. If only there were a way to escape internet news. The primaries will be over soon, which is a relief, I can stop agonizing over whether or not Obama will blow it to Hillary. But then the baseball season starts and I MUST have a fantasy team, and I MUST obsess over it. I'm determined to win. On the bright side, I don't have any drug or alcohol problems. On the downside, I am lame.&nbsp; 

At some point I should post a list of all the books I read last year. And no, I didn't make it to fifty."

"event","<p>If i end up in hell, it's very likely that my job will be to answer the phone, ""Good afternoon, thank you for calling Hell. This is Phil, how can I help you?"" and then the other line hangs up. The phone never stops ringing, and I have to say that over and over again, only to end up with a dial tone on the other end. That's how work feels tonight.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am in desperate need of a vacation, and thankfully, mine starts tomorrow.<br /><br />Tonight I've been looking over the AWP Conference Schedule, drooling over panel descriptions like only a literary nerd could. The State of American Short Fiction. Mmmmmmm. I'm looking forward to meeting lots of authors like Charles Baxter, Dan Chaon (again), maybe Jon Irving, Joyce Carol Oates, and finally find out who Ha Jin is. I've heard a few people address him as our generation's best writer. Who the fuck is he?&nbsp;<br /><br />And I'll probably get a lot of free magazines and spend too much money on books.&nbsp;Sitting through a couple dozen lectures about literature probably sounds awful to most people, but I think it's going to be pretty goddamn relaxing.<br /><br />Catie and I will be staying a beautiful Doubletree in midtown, and will get to walk past the 30 Rock on our way to the Hilton. Perhaps we'll meet famous Hollywood celebrities like Tracy Jordan. Then on Thursday is the LOST premier, which we'll be watching with Hoboaken's Jordan Mollot. After that, we will drink to LOST. I've been prepping for the season premier by watching some old second season episodes. (ABC has all three seasons up on their website right now) I think I've decided that the second season is my favorite. You find out what's in the hatch. Then you gotta push the button every 108 minutes, so there's always this dramatic countdown and you know that sooner or later they won't be able to push the button, and no one knows what's going to happen. The confident, spiritual Locke of the first season has a major crisis of faith. Then there's Henry Gale playing mind games with the Losties, fueling the power struggle between Jack and Locke. If that's not enough, Eko and Ana Lucia join the cast and are both pretty awesome. The Others are out there doing who knows what. Michael is willing to do anything to get his kid back. Charlie goes off the deep end for a while. Everything just comes together really well in&nbsp; a way that season three didn't.&nbsp;<br /><br />Um, anyways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll also get to see Sara Basher and probably Kathryn Watson. Maybe even Sarah Gainer and Jackie Collier. Then on Saturday, Catie and I will be celebrating our one year anniversary, so we'll get to celebrate with a nice restaurant, and then I'll propose to her on the Empire State Building (I hope Catie doesn't read this thing). Then once we get back we can focus on all things Boston. Devin and Angie have been helping us out a lot, which is great.<br /><br />Oh, and I haven't written in here in a while so let me say that I'm really excited to get my tax money back as soon as possible. And the tax rebate is going to be amazing too. Catie is already planning how to use it.&nbsp;""Basically, President Bush just bought me a puppy.""&nbsp;Yes, Catie. That's what he wants. If you look at the chart you can see that previously, 70% of Americans thought the country was going in the wrong direction. Post-puppy rebate,&nbsp;all Americans were happy with everything. <br /><br />And one last thing, one of the guests staying here is named Cynthia Martini. I'm pretty sure she is related to Tila Tequila.</p>"

"event","<p>Last week Catie's friends Erica and Frannie came to visit, but I was stuck at work and missed out on the fun. Usually, that's something that's not worth mentioning in here, BUT they played Rummy and&nbsp;I WAS STUCK AT WORK! I love Rummy! The week before, there was a semi-big family gathering at my parents place with Nana and Pap, Josh and Holly, my parents, Kendra, Catie and I. And we played a big game of double deck Rummy. My dad and I got annhialated and ended the game almost 200 points in the whole. It was disgraceful.<br /><br />Anyways, after missing out on a night of Rummy, Catie and I went to Cherry Alley Cafe the next day, got some delicious sandwiches and played a few rounds of Speed. Unfortunately, I'm just a bit too slow and Catie always accuses me of cheating anyways because I use two hands. Dude, two hands should totally be allowed. Stupid rule. Cherry Alley is a great game supporter in the community. The table we sat at was had a built in Parcheesi board. Haven't played that game in a while, but I love Parcheesi, and I'd love to get a new copy with elephants and giraffe pieces. All the pieces in my Parcheesi board were bit up by a dog or a baby or something, or a baby dog. I don't know what. But they're disgusting to use. Cherry Alley is also great because every Tuesday they have Scrabble night. Unfortunately, Tuesday is also trivia night at the Bull Run AND at BJs. Not to mention that I'm usually working Tuesday nights. Sucks. But anyways, they seem to have some hardcore Scrabblers there and I'd like to take them down. One of these nights we will show up with our custom Puppy Scrabble&nbsp; board and kick some ass.<br /><br />Family life is also a lot better now that we've made it clear that we're not there to visit. None of this sitting around watching tv and talking bullshit. Just bring out the games. ... And if you want to serve a big tasty meal, that is okay too. When I go to my parents house alot of times we end up playing SEQUENCE. Sometimes when Holly is around we will play Clue: The Great Museum Caper. Both games are largely neglected in the gaming community, but awesome, I assure you. Another game that we haven't played in a while: Star Wars Monopoly. My mom bought this for my dad for their anniversary a few years ago. I'm a big fan of Monopoly in general, but it's even better when you're playing as Obi Wan Kenobi and buying up places like Kashyyyk and Cloud City.&nbsp;<br /><br />When we go to Catie's house we always play Blitz with her family. Blitz (also known as 31 or Skat) has become an essential part of my life. I tried to download a computer version of it, but they're just not the same. Also, when I googled Skat it came up with a lot of things about girls shitting on guys and golden showers and whathaveyou. So apparently skat is another word for that. Cool.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two nights ago Wolfy and Dustin came over and we played Risk 2210 for the first time. Risk is another one of my all time favorite games. I've been playing that a lot on facebook lately. This version was good too, but a lot different since you have to take over ocean cities, and the moon, and all of the fighting is done with tiny robots. Hopefully the future really is like that.&nbsp;Sidenote, Lord of the Rings Risk, also awesome.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then last night, me and my dad started playing Axis and Allies. This game was given to me as a gift after I graduated high school but I never got to actually play, because none of my friends have the patience to learn it. It's really not all that complicated once you get started. But it does take a lot more strategy and takes a lot longer than Risk, which is fine with me. I can't wait to get home and keep playing. Nazi Germany is holding Europe, Africa and has wiped out pretty much all of Germany at this point. But I'm still convinced I can come back. </p><p>I leave work in a few minutes and I'm headed to Catie's house to open presents and whatever. Once THAT is over with, we can get down to business, maybe play Blitz while listening to the Home Alone soundtrack (one of the best soundtracks of all time) and I also hear that her sister brought home TV Scene It. I've never played a Scene It game before.</p><p>Also, because it's um... Christmas, yeah, that's it, because it's Christmas, I implore all of you to share your favorite games or game moments. If you don't reply then you're probably not even my friend.</p>"

"event","The New York Times is running this great series called ""Choking On Success"" about the industrial boom in China, and the effect it is having on their environment: namely, turning all of China into a wasteland. Thank God for American enviromentalists. There's still a lot of filth in America, but it could be a lot worse. The land of fish and rice has made economic growth a priority no matter the cost. Its fish have been poisoned, and irrigation water is so contaminated that farmers can't touch it or their skin will fall off. In some areas, truck traffic is so bad that if you open your window at night you'll wake up with your face covered in black soot. 

China is horrible in so many ways. Their workers are treated horribly. They are devastating the environment. And they spit in the face of economic freedom. I can't fathom why we would honor them with the Olympics? Is it just in hopes that the media attention will force them to improve to escape some of the embarrassment?

For the past few years I've been really interested in the development of rising countries like China, India, and Iran, and the growth of super cities like Dubai. Globalization / modernization. Tom Friedman kind of stuff. I always read his articles, but I still haven't read any of his books. Does anyone have a copy of The World Is Flat or Longtitudes and Attitudes?   Anyways, the industrial revolutions in America and Brittain are fascinating, too. Does every country striving to become a global economic power initially have to treat its workers like crap and destory the environment? Then, only once the money starts flowing in do the workers have the power to complain about their working conditions and the pollution? We're lucky to have developed earlier when humans were quite so expert at destroying the environment. Now, our pollutants are more advanced and it will be much harder to remove them.

On a somewhat related note, there is a huge new shopping development being built next to the hotel. They started clearing this space way back in my freshman year. I remember because while they were clearing it they let some enormous trees fall onto some abandoned houses... and you know, it looked cool. Anyways, at one point the space was supposed to be used to build a Super Walmart. Then the current WalMart would have been made into a Sam's Club. That deal fell through, and Lewisburg ended up with the Super Walmart, and their old WalMart is now just a giant empty building. The area by the Super Walmart is now really built up with Applebees, Sheetz, and another Hampton Inn. Across from the SuperWalmart there's a new strip mall that has Immix, Original Italian Pizza, and maybe two or three other stores. But more than half of those brand new storefronts have never been filled. Which makes sense. How can they compete with a brand new Super Walmart?

For a while we've been trying to figure out which stores are coming in next to us. A lot of guests are curious about it, and the people in town REALLY want to know. We finally found out a partial list: Target, Giant, Home Depot, Red Robin, Chiles, Rossi's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Bed Bath and Beyond, Starbucks and Kohls. There are still eight empty spots. There's also speculation that across the street where the Rex is/was they are going to put in an Olive Garden and Red Lobster. They will most likely have to put three more traffic lights on the strip.

The local people talk about the development ususally in terms of ""this area really needs a (fill in the blank)."" I admit that I'd really like to see a Borders or Barnes and Nobles go in. And having a Sonic would be amazing. But people should really rethink what we ""need."" There's already a GIANT like two miles away. This Home Depot will be about a mile away from Lowes. Starbucks might hurt the Kind Cafe. Chile's could drive Casa Sanchez out of business. And BJs is already on the brink of bankruptcy and sinking fast. Target will probably put KMart out of its misery, which means a red light will be directing traffic at an empty parking lot. 

I admit that despite my hatred of shopping, Target is enough to get me excited. And most of these stores are ""different"" yes. But getting back to the ""what this area needs"" argument, part of their reasoning is just not wanting to drive to Harrisburg for some of these stores. Part of it is like a stamp of approval for the area, like, now Selinsgrove is really on the map because we have a Target. Never mind that traffic is already horrible on the strip, never mind the empty store fronts.

Maybe people don't realize that what makes a town great is not how many corporations think they can make money in a five mile strip of road. Why not promote some nice local bars and restaurants? That would be a start at least. The other day a guest asked me what happeend to Sunbury. Twenty, thirty years ago, Sunbury was the shit, and Selinsgrove was nothing. Now Sunbury is god awful, and Selinsgrove is ""on the rise."" In the end, the guest concluded that it was the university that had kept our side of the river thriving. That may be part of it. But a bigger part may be that a lot of corporations are looking to expand to the next tier of towns and we just so happened to have a lot of empty farmland located on a busy highway.

Alex posted a link on his facebook page. www.thestoryofstuff.com You should really watch this video. It's been haunting me and I pretty much feel awful whenever I buy ANYTHING."

"event","This weekend Dustin, Chris and I went to NYC to see Crispin Glover. We stayed at Jordan's place in Hoboaken. I've never been there before and was really surprised how nice it was. But it's kind of like that episode of Futurama when Bender and Fry are looking for an apartment. They see an ad that says ""suspiciously perfect apartment."" When they go there Fry says ""Hey, this place looks perfect for us. What's the catch?"" And the landlord says ""Oh, I assure you, there is no catch. Although we are technically in New Jersey."" Cut to Fry and Bender on the couch saying ""Man, not one place remotely liveable.""

There's a beautiful view of the city, there are lots of nice shops, and dogs! But no parking. I ended up having to pay thirty bucks to park for a day. Jersey bastards. So anyways, we made fun of Day After Tomorrow for a while, then took the Path into the city to meet Jordan's friend Erica at Grand Central Station. I can check that off of my NY tourist spots now.

Then it came time to decide what to eat. I wanted to have an authentic Brooklyn Style Pizza.... from Dominoes. Then Jordan told us about a place that serves a great Chicago style pizza. For a while we toyed with the idea of going to McDonalds because Americans make mighty fine hamburgers. But finally we decided to go to Chipotle to forcefeed Chris his fourth burrito of the week. We walked like twenty blocks to get there... but then we couldn't find it. So we took the subway to the movie theater and ate at a pizza place next door.

While we ate, I got a call from Josh. He and Holly were in Haight Ashbury (sp?) in San Francisco and were looking for the house from Full House. Awesome. Even better was that Erica lived in San Francisco and kind of maybe knew where she thought it was.... Okay, I'm sure they didn't find it.

The movie wasn't nearly as disturbing as I thought it would be. It was just strange. What was even weirder was the Crispin Glover slideshow, in which he read from his eight ""books."" They were a lot like hybrid works with an angry, psychotic feel to them. My favorites were ""Around My House"" and ""Son of My Mother."" Then he kind of rambled on during the question and answer session. I was expecting him to be smarter and creepier, but I guess no one is perfect. 

After the show we took the subway over to the Upright Citizens Brigade to see the three on three finals. Four groups performed and all of them were pretty funny. It was a great time.

The next morning I had to fight all the post-Thanksgiving traffic to get home. It took me two or three hours to get out of New Jersey. Which reminds me, FUCK JERSEY."

"event","The other morning Catie made me watch an hour of Frasier. Then later that night we watched like an hour and a half of Sex and the City. So now, I say it is only fair that she watch an hour of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. She has reluctantly agreed that this is fair. Jokes on her, because although I hated Frasier when it was on the air, I don't mind it much anymore. And Sex and the City is actually a pretty good except for when they're talking about shoes. I like pointing out all of the terrible lessons that the show teaches women, mostly that it is okay to be treated like shit most of the time, because then if the man does something remotely nice, it seems like he is the best man in the world.

But let me get back to the important thing here. I'm predicting that in a few weeks, Catie will be begging me to put a life size bust of Lt. Worf on our coffee table.

In other news, tomorrow Chris, Dustin and I are going to meet up with Jordan in Hoboken and then head into the city to see the new Crispin Glover movie. Crispin Glover had a huge effect on my formative years, namely because of his part in Back to the Future Part 1. Dustin, Wolfgang and I have easily seen this movie hundreds of times and are ready to say or respond to any line from the trilogy. When I was a kid I used to wake up really early before school. Sometimes I'd eat some leftovers for breakfast and then watch a movie before school, namely, part of the Back to the Future trilogy, Star Trek II-VI, or one of the Star Wars movies. This is why Back to the Future is as much a part of me as an arm or a leg.

So anyways, Crispin Glover used the money he used from Charlie's Angels and Willard to produce this crazy movie trilogy based on all of the things that make movie audiences uncomfortable. Most of the actors have downds syndrome. The lead actor in the second movie is incomprehensible. There seem to be plenty of images of snails being covered in salt, a wheelchair crushing a girls neck, and other bizarre scenes that I wouldnt' even know how to describe.

What's even better is that Glover is going to be there to give a lecture after the movie. If anyone is interested they can view the trailers here:

Sooooo messed up. If you enjoy sleeping soundly, then don't watch it. I showed it to one of the housekeepers today and she also thought it was awesome. Then we watched Man Vs. Wild and it was the Serengetti episode where he bites meat off of the neck of a freshly killed zebra. What a great show."

"event","Last year, Thanksgiving was not a good time for me. There were a few Colorado State students who were getting together for a meal, but I wasn't super close to any of them. Meredith and I were broken up and definitely on bad terms by that point, so going together would have been kind of strange. Didn't matter anyways because I ended up having to work that night. It really really sucked. That night was probably spent like a lot of other nights, listening to NPR, folding some laundry, reading a book. For dinner I had a can of Campbells Soup. I told myself I'd go to Boston Market sometime that week and make that my Thanksgiving meal but I can't remember if I ever went or not.

This year things are a lot better. Sunday we had a dinner at my parent's place. Jehovah's Witnesses don't typically celebrate Thanksgiving, but everyone in my family was there and we had turkey, filling potatoes, corn, greenbean casserole, crescants, etcetera, so really, it was Thanksgiving a few days early. We watched some awesome episodes of MythBusters, got Margot really wound up, and after our feast we played a few rounds of SEQUENCE. It was great.

Tomorrow I have to work on Thanksgiving again. But we're having lunch beforehand, this time at Catie's uncle's place, somewhere in Selinsgrove. Everyone in Catie's family will be there. Maggie has prepped me on what to say if anyone mentions ""the game."" First I'll say ""Brett Favre is so oooooold"" and then, if I need to say anything else I'll say ""Those cheese hats are pretty neat, huh?""

Last night Catie and I went to the Cherry Alley cafe. Tuesdays are Scrabble night! I knew the kid working there, D.J. I'll have to go back sometime, it's a really cool place. After playing one game we went back to the house and drank beers. Bull Run Trivia Night was cancelled, so we went to the movies to see Dan In Real Life. It was unbearable. Don't see it.

Life is good right now."

Top Eighteen TV Characters
I feel way too strongly about this to limit it to just five.
John Locke, LOST (his whole life was shitty and he grew into a sad, pathetic man. but then he prepared himself for the ultimate spiritual journey, an australian walkabout. that didn't work out, but he ended up on the island and became the ultimate proof that everything happens for a reason)

Gob, Arrested Development 

David Brent, The Office (UK) (sure Steve's Carrell is funny in the US version, but David Brent is hilarious and in a more realistic, and horrifying way)

Christian Troy, Nip/Tuck (no explanation needed)

William T. Riker, Star Trek The Next Generation (that was a great beard)

Eliot, Scrubs (ooh la la)

Carl Winslow, Family Matters (some people don't like him because of his anger issues, but he put up with so much shit. You would have acted the same way. Plus his work as a policeman made him a hero. Best dad ever)

Mulder, X-Files (b/c it's fucking Mulder)

Jean Parmesian, Arrested Development (even though he was only in like two episodes)

The Lone Gunmen, X-Files (yes, they count as one character)

Gizmo Duck / Fenton McQuack (probably one of my favorite cartoon superheroes of all time, just for the contrast between the hero and alterego)

George Costanza, Seinfeld (the best episodes involved George at work)

Desmond, LOST (he was a coward, yes, but he was brought to the island for great things. also, Penny+Desmond=best love story on LOST)

Professor Arturo, Sliders (worst mistake the show ever made was replacing him with a really hot girl. see, that's how great he was)

Norm, Cheers (another great fat guy)

Xander, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Apparently my years in highschool were so uncool that I look up to Xander as a cool icon. damn I'm pathetic)

George Michael, Arrested Development (""I was going to buy the marijuana and smoke it.. like a cigarette"")

Bender, Futurama (fuckin Bender) (honorable mention for Zoidberg)

Kevin Arnold, Wonder Years (watching the show now I can see that Kevin was a real ass sometimes. But I always sympathize with him)


Oh man, that was great. The only thing that could make this list better is...
MY FAVORITE EPISODES OF LOST!


15. The Moth. 1.7. The relationship between Charlie and Locke was really strong in this episode. Most of Charlie's flashbacks were kind of pointless or just boring, but this one was good.

14. Exodus.  1.23-4. Trek into jungle to find dynamite and blow up hatch. Danielle steals Aaron. Arnst blows up.

13.  The Man Behind the Curtain.  3.20. Ben's rise to power. I'm lucky I didn't have a panic attack after the end of this episode.

12.  Greatest Hits.  3.21. Best moments of Charlies life. 

11.  Not In Portland.  3.07. Here's how I feel anytime I see Juliet: ""man I hate her. wait, she's okay. no, she sucks. ugh, i don't care."" This episode raised a lot of questions about how powerful the Others are.

10.  Numbers.  1.18. I love the numbers. Unfortunately it will probably never be explained. 

9.  Lockdown.  2.17. Locke has to trust Henry Gale to push the numbers. Sees map of island on the walls. 

8.  Dave.  2.18. It's all in Hurley's head.
 
7.  Man of Science Man of Faith.  2.1. Starts with Desmond's morning routine. Then they finally go down the hatch. Flashback: Jack meets Sarah and fixes her, one of the last Jack episodes I really like.

6.  Catch 22.  3.17. Flashback, Desmond joins the monastary. Realtime, Desmond can find Penny and get off the island as long as he lets Charlie get shot in the throat with a metal arrow. Rough. Oh, and then Penelope tells them that Flight 815 was recovered and everyone was found dead. WTF?

5.  Deus Ex Machina.  1.19. Locke meets his parents but loses his kidney. Theresa falls up the stairs Theresa falls down the stairs. Boone dies. Ends with Locke pounding on the hatch door, screaming ""what else do you want from me?!"" and a bright light turns on. Holy shit. 

4.  Flashes Before Your Eyes.  3.08. Hey whatever happened to Desmond when the hatch blew up? Oh yeah, he fuckin traveled through time. 

3.  The Pilot. Wow.

2. Walkabout.  1.6. Locke leads a boar hunt and confronts the Monster. Oh yeah, then you find out HE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR. Holyshit.  Holyshitsholyshitholyshit.

1. Live Together Die Alone.  2.23. Second season finale. At first you think, ughhh why is this a Desmond flashback I don't care. By the end, Desmond was one of my favorite characters. Hatch blows up. Jack, Sawyer and Kate are taken captive. Holy shit.


Wow, that took a long time to do. What was I thinking? But let's be honest, this is the kind of thing I want to have documented twenty years from now, ha. Thinking about this has really shown my favorite characters: Locke, Desmond, Hurley, and Charlie. I never thought of myself as a huge Charlie fan, but he is pretty great. Ana Lucia and Eko were both great too. And Michael's first two episodes were actually really good. I was so close to listing the Bernard and Rose flashback on this list, ha. THAT is the love story of our time."

"event","My brother's wedding is next week and I still haven't finished this so I need help. Here's the deal, there's going to be a DJ at the reception for dancing and such, but he wanted me to put together an indie wedding playlist. Just something that will be played at the reception to cover the time from the wedding party's picture session, through the meal. It won't even be really loud, so I don't think lyrics are a huge issue. But, you know, it should be indie. And I've come to accept my definition of indie as this: any song that I like. So it covers a lot of classic rock and some pop too I guess.

So friends, I am in dire need of suggestions/feedback, asap. The problem with making it an indie wedding mix is that there aren't very many happy indie love songs. They seem to specialize in various forms of sexual frustration, unstable relationships, or otherwise jaded lovers. Those sorts of things tend to bring down the mood at a wedding.

Here are the songs I have so far:

Air: You Make It Easy
The Beatles: Across the Universe, In My Life
Belle and Sebastian: If She Wants Me, Funny Little Frog
Ben Folds Five: The Luckiest
The Brunettes: Holding Hands, Feeding Ducks
Coldplay: Green Eyes, Yellow (maybe)
The Corrs w/ Bono: When the Stars Go Blue (just sounds better than the Ryan Adams version)
CSNY: Our House
The Cure: Just Like Heaven, High, Close to Me (probably cutting this one)
Deathcab: A Lack of Color
The Decemberists: O Valencia!
The Elected: Would You Come With Me?
Eva Cassidy: Fields of Gold
Feist: My Moon My Man, 1234
The Flaming Lips: Do You Realize?? (maybe)
The Gadjits: Waffle House Is Not a Home (maybe)
Jets to Brazil: Cat Heaven
John Lennon: Oh Yoko!
The Magnetic Fields: The Book of Love
Mazzy Star: Fade Into You
Moldy Peaches: Anyone Else
Neil Young: Harvest Moon
Neutral Milk Hotel: In the Aeroplane Over the Sea
Nick Drake: Northern Sky
Peter Bjorn and John: Start to Melt
Postal Service: Such Great Heights
Postal Service: Brand New Colony
Regina Spektor: Us
REM: At My Most Beautiful
Rod Stewart: Ooh La La
Shins: We Will Become Silhouettes
Sufjan Stevens: To Be Alone With You
Tilly and the Wall: Shake It Out
Van Morrison: Dancing In the Moonlight
Weezer: Island In the Sun
Wilco: I'm The Man Who Loves You, Jesus etc (Catie said I should cut this)

"event","The other day I was flipping through the channels and I saw this cartoon that looked kind of familiar, but I couldn't place it. Then I realized it was an updated version of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Dave went to this big creepy mansion to apologize to a guy because Alvin had broken into his house and broken his antique cane. Then Theodore and his gf were in this play and his gf was like ""Theodore I'm so nervous, I can't remember any of my lines."" And he was like ""That doesn't matter because everyone in the audience will be too busy admiring my performance."" 

If my memory serves me correctly, the old cartoon was not like that. Alvin was a troublemaker but he didn't break into people's houses and break their stuff. As for Theodore, apparently he's teaching boys how to put women (or as he would probably call them, ho's) in their place.

I did a search for the Chipmunks and found out that there is a new movie coming out in December starring Jason Lee as Dave Seville. And the chipmunks are all computer generated, and look like they're from the hood. Is the world ready for the chipmunks new image? They were bad enough before. Remember Alvin's girlfriend Brittany? She was such a slut. Her skirt was so short you could see everything! Sure, it was just chipmunk parts, but I wouldn't want my son/daughter to be staring at that stuff, getting ideas.

So now it's going to be even worse. Here's an episode idea, Simon tells Dave that Alvin has been using dirty needles. Dave tries to get Alvin to straighten up, but Alvin stabs him. Then Alvin's street gang brands the word NARC into Simon's chest, and leaves him for dead, tied to a tree. Things will then settle down to the normal towards the end of the episode, just to show kids that you can still have a happy family life even in these crazy times. Then maybe the last ten seconds Dave will find out that Alvin got a girl pregnant. ""ALVIIIINNNNNNN!!!!"" Then Alvin shrugs and winks at the camera. It's always good to go out on a comedic note.

Also, I was reading a character description of Dave and it described as being ""like any other single parent trying to raise three kids"". ... They're chipmunks! The last episode of the series should take place in a mental hospital. Dave will wake up in a straight jacket, and the doctors will tell him that he's heavily medicated, but now he can get the help he needs. Throughout the episode Dave will have to wrestle with the fact that Alvin, Simon and Theodore were all just figments of his imagination and he's been living in a fantasy world since 1958."

"event","Saturday. Hampton had its third and final Catch Me at My Best Party of the summer. The first was Hawaiin themed, the second was an icecream party, and this was a slumber party. Everyone wore pajamas, they laid blankets out over the lobby floor, and we got a ton of popcorn from the cinema center. Seriously, after the party was over there was still an entire garbage bag filled with popcorn. It was kind of repulsive actually.

Unfortunately, I didnt get to go to the party because I had my hospital appointment. That sucks, especially since I was the Catch Me at My Best winner. Basically, whenever you do something great, someone writes out a Catch Me card for you. And I won, cuz I'm great. Out of the four summers I've been here, I won three times. (WOW) During the summer I am just on my game. From now on, you can refer to June, July and August as ""Philtime"" or ""Philtimez."" So I get another Applebees certificate, and fifty bucks. Woot!

So I went to the hospital and everything was a mess. They didn't have any record of me being there. Then when they did get it started, the tubing kept clogging up. It took a lot longer than usual. Luckily, Catie spent the day with me, which was great. No one has sat through my hospital treatment with me in the past six years. It meant a lot to me. 

That night we went to Kim Holland's big going away bash. Catie and I met everyone at Molly (Dustin's two LITs) Brannigans. Al, Chris, Dustin, 2 Matts and Alan. The waitress there admired my ID. Think about it, this is someone who looks at dozens of IDs every night, and she liked mine. People love me. I think that this year, Philtimez extended into September. Maybe I can keep it rolling.

Annnnyways, we had some beers, then headed to Smalls, this punk rock bar. They had a bizarre Joey Ramone shrine. There was a big blown up picture of him, but his eye was like glowing or something, so he looked like a cyborg. Also, he was wearing a Ramones shirt. You can't wear a tshirt for your own band. Lame. Then they had like a microphone stand, a broken guitar, and other random stuff in the display case. I don't think any of it related to Joey Ramone in any way, other than that, you know, he played guitar, and used a microphone. What was cool though was their Ms. Pacman machine. The more I drank, the better I got. It was great. Catie had a great time playing too, I think b/c she liked the cute ghosts. You can't let them fool you with their pretty colors though. Those ghosts will fuck you up.

Then, after more drinking, there was lots of dancing. Except for Jackie who did not dance. DJ ill (my favorite DJ of all time, and pre-time) was rockin. There were a bunch of people dancing in a circle, and everytime one of their friends would dance they would chant their name, like ""Gor-don, Gor-don, Gor-don"". Then I saw Dustin in the circle and they started chanting ""Guy, Guy, Guy, Guy, Guy, Guy!"" and it was awesome. Then I went in and they started chanting ""Yel-low shirt, Yel-low shirt, Yel-low shirt!"" It was one of the greatest moments of my life. It was a lot like during the Tampa trip. We were in Pleasure Island in the disco club, w/ the spinning floor, and I was extremely drunk. I'm not sure why but I started chanting ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"" and then other people started doing it. Catie made me leave the dance floor because I was too drunk and she was afraid I was going to make both of us fall down. While I was sitting there some people came up and gave me high fives and were chanting ""yeah, yeah, yeah"". Seriously, I was a hero in that club.

But back to this party. Kim gave everyone party poppers that we were supposed to use at midnight. It got close to midnight, and this guy started giving a speech about how awesome DJ ill is. Then some people used their poppers, and we started yelling ""NOT YET!"" and we yelled that for a while. Then there was a lot of cheering for ill, and we started yelling more stuff, not sure what. I think we just kept saying ""NOT YET!"" even after all the poppers exploded. My throat was really sore after all the screaming. Then I picked up streamers off the floor and yelled ""WOOO!"" and ""NOT YET!"" a lot. Then we left. 

Kim is one of the coolest people I know and the party was a fitting farewell. I've booked them some rooms for their cross country trip. I'm really glad that I could do something to help them out. ill is a nice guy, too. Though he's no Jordan Mollot. Remember that time I had a going away party? Dustin and Sara were kind of together. And Jordan and Kim had a moment where they were both brushing their teeth and they had such a connection that Kim asked Jordan ""are we soulmates?"" But it didn't work out. All of the couples there fell apart, even Emily Seibert's faghag relationship with Christopher Vazquez. Haturday is cursed.

Anyways, after we left the party there was a big puking incident involving Alex. Dustin told me he had to help Al walk to the car. Then I got the version of events from Kim, who told me that Dustin kind of stood near Al, not really helping, just trying to play it cool, trying to impress some girls. Oh Dustin. Then after the party, ill Cosby said ""I think it went well. At least no one puked."" Then someone told him ""No. That one guy definitely puked everywhere."""

after feist ----> after feist party @ justin's place, dillsburg featuring performance by 'old time burials' and a guy from 'wax and wane'. 25 kids sitting in the basement while justin played guitar, another kid played a eukelale (i think) and they alternated with a tiny xylophone. followed by this guy with an electric guitar and looping machine. really impressed me. wish i'd bought a cd. free beer served from cabinet. chris drinking jack. dustin complaining about how hungry he was. hot jackie waiting for us for xx minutes b/c chris had to catch a frog and tell a story about gingerale. allison ritmayer lookalike in crowd. identical. everyone at the party could play guitar and did. dustin passing out on the floor, realizing that giving chris his car keys was probably a bad idea.

SATURDAY

Beautiful day. Sat outside Justin's house for awhile until Chris brought the car home.     Met Heverling children at Ange's apartment in Harrisburg. Put six holes in the wall, but was unable to hang up the curtain rod.     Lunch at Kurry in a Hurry. Tasty Indian food. Greg had idea for ""Heverling by the Slice, Ordinary People giving you Pizza. Taps into anti-Italian sentiment in America b/c ""you know it's out there.""

Next Catie and I went to Target to buy presents for Josh and Holly's wedding shower. After debating how much I'm obligated to spend, we decided to go with a nice spice rack and two sets of platewear. AND a Swedish Chef birthday card, b/c all of the wedding shower cards were lame. 

At the shower, there was lots of food then lots of pictures of Josh and Holly opening presents. The present thing went on for like two hours. Then they tried playing music so people would dance, but everybody was like ""we're not dancin, we're going home"". Then I talked to Paul Frantz for a while and my old friend Brandon asked me if I wanted to start a bible study. I told him that ""I had a lot on my plate."" Why did I say that? I should have just said that my life is infinitely happier w/o that religion, and it took me forever to get out of it, why I would want back in?

Annnyways, then I excused myself to go to Lewisburg and get drunk. Catie, Dustin, Erica, Allison and The Caleb. Had the great idea to open up chain of 99cent stores. Towne Tavern. Had the great idea to drink ""nothing but shots for the rest of the night."" Puked. Puked puked puked puked. Force fed Pepto from a shot glass. Passed out. Perkins. Had the great idea to open up a chain of 99cent Perkins. Gagged just at the mention of shots. 

Wow, this was a really great weekend. I talked to Dustin for a long time. Got to see Chris. Met Chris' friend Maria who was really cool. Had a great concert/houseparty experience. Did a good deed for my brother. Attempted good deed for Catie's sister. And had lots of Phil/Catie time. Currently I'm wrapping up a sixteen hour shift, but I'm really not tired. It seems that the John Locke emmy win has brought peace to the earth... and my heart. Thank you John Locke."

"event","My 50 Book Challenge isn't going so great seeing as how I've only read fourteen books this year, and don't foresee any way that I'll manage to finish another 36 by the end of January. Oh well. Fourteen is still a lot better than I did last year. Plus there were some that I started and never finished. Will You Always Love Me? by Joyce Carol Oates, I stayed with it for a long time but after a while just couldn't take it anymore it was just too boring. Couldn't really get into Portrait of the Artist as a young man. I'm a horrible literature student, I know.

I hoped that doing the challenge would help me get through the many unread books I have in my library, and I did pretty well with that for a while, but lately I've gone a spending spree. A couple weeks ago I went crazy with Amazon, buying the following:
The Duke of Deception: Geoffrey Wolfe
In the Garden of the North American Martyrs: Tobias Wolff
Winesburg, Ohio: Sherwood Anderson
The Collected Stories of Richard Yates
The Stories of Breece D'J Pancake

The last three being Sal recommendations. Then I was in Websters in State College and found The Night in Question, another collection from Tobias Wolff, and a few weeks later Dustin bought me a copy of Dickens' Our Mutual Friend. 

But that's nothing compared to the harvest reaped during the Boston trip. Before we left Catie bought me Happiness: A History, a book that I heard about on NPR close to a year ago and have wanted ever since. It was just sitting in that cute cardshop in Lewisburg, taunting me, saying ""you don't read enough to even consider buying me."" Thankfully Catie told that book who is in charge. Anyway, Boston has a million great bookstores that we stopped in: The Coop, The Harvard Bookstore, The Raven, The Booksmith, etc etc. Here's what I ended up with:

Brief Interviews with Hideous Men: David Foster Wallace
Collected Stories: Saul Bellow
The Worst Years of Your Life: compliation of literature based on teenagers
The Paris Review Book of People With Problems
and a fantastic magazine called N+1

Feels like I bought more books than that but thank god I got out with just those five because this is going to take me forever. 

Some people don't understand this compulsion to buy books. I try fighting it, but have to give in. Any self respecting writer should have an impressive library of modern literature. When I read a book I want to keep it. It becomes part of me. Plus, if I just got books from libraries I couldn't mark in them. Underlining is part of reading. If I have a book I have a pen. A good pen, gel, dark black. I'm not messin around here. Don't hate on me Or I'll hit you in the face with a hardcover. Or papercut you. Bah. Work in four and a half hours. Goodnight."

Not in an erotic sex dream type of way, more like it just happened in an episode of the show. My dream also has guest appearances from a time travelling Return of the Jedi Storm Trooper, and Usher.

So in the dream I'm Eric from the show, but then I'm me, and maybe even Ashton Kutcher for part of the dream. Thank God I wasn't Fez. So I meet Donna in Bots (the bar in Selinsgrove) and she's looking really hot (even though I don't think she's that hot on the show, but I know she is pretty hot in real life) and she's all over me and clearly wants to hook up with me. So we start making out but then I look out the window and I see a Storm Trooper (the kind that ride those air motorcycle things through the forests of Endor) and I'm like ""Oh no.""

So the Storm Trooper catches me and he's like ""You can't have sex with Donna or else Donna and Eric will have chlamydia in the future."" I'm like ""I don't have chlamydia, there's no way that my having sex with her will cause that. She's hot. I'm bangin her.""

Me and Donna go into the woods and there's this pond filled with algae and stuff and she wants to have sex in there. So we do, but there are apparently leaches in the pond. The leaches attach onto Donna and she gets Chlamydia FROM THE LEACHES! So it turns out that I did cause her and Eric to get Chlamydia (I'm assuming she has sex with Eric in a later episode).

Who knows what effect their Chlamydia had on the future. Hopefully nothing too serious. Also, while I was in the bar, Usher walked in and I was like ""Oh man, it's Ja Rule!"" even though I don't even know what Ja Rule looks like and it was clearly Usher. Usher goes up to some people that he knows and he's all happy and nice and stuff. Someone tells me that he comes to Bots all the time cuz he really likes it there (Bots sucks, I hate Bots) so no one else is really impressed that he's there except me, so I feel like an idiot."

"event","Sunday. In the morning I was at work and had to babysit Victoria. She was like ""Hey. Did you miss me?"" I said ""Nope. I don't like you. Did you miss me?"" ""Nope."" I am so good with kids.

While she was here we went to Barbie.com and created some designer outfits, then we listened to Barbie radio and listened to Kelly Clarkson.

At night, Dustin and I went to the drive in with Wolfgang and some of his friends to see Transformers and Knocked Up. Transformers was sooo bad. The only good thing was that we were outside so could talk and make fun of it the whole time. The movie would have been a lot better if it was just an Even Stevens / Transformers crossover. Wolfgang started dating this girl Laura. Me and Dustin weren't sure whether this was a good thing or not. But during the movie she said ""I wish my name was Optimus Prime. People would like me more and I'd feel better about myself."" After that we were like ""Oh man. This girl is a keeper."" 

After that we watched Knocked Up. I was immensely disappointed by The 40 Year Old Virgin. That movie had some hilarious Everybody Loves Raymond jokes, but for the most part, everyone in the audience laughed at such stupid things, like Steve Carrell yelling ""Kelly Clarkson!"" Fuck you America. So I was kind of worried about Knocked Up. But it turned out to be hysterical. Funniest movie I've seen in theaters since Team America. Actually, no. Hot Fuzz was really great too.

Yesterday I went to the doctor and they fixed my toe. It's been in a lot of pain for like six weeks. Part of my toe nail had come off and I didn't know why. Turns out I had an ingrown toe nail. So they numbed it, then went inside with some scissors. There was lots of blood. And the doctor was like ""Does this hurt"" and I'm like ""Nope. Feels great.""

In ten days or so it should be better. It took a lot of abuse while it was soar and it hurt like hell. One day Margot bit into it with her fangs. I'd bump it against something almost every day. It was so bad that it even hurt when I dropped a pen on it. So you can imagine how it felt when i was in a used bookstore and a stack of books fell directly on my toe. That hurt so much that I yelled ""Kelly Clarkson!"" And then everyone in America laughed."

Me: Can you believe Harry died like that?! Holy shit!
Jori: Don't tell me!
Me: Wow. So much blood. Horrifying.
Jori: There's no blood in Harry Potter. They use spells.
Me: Oh... right. Yeah, it was a blood spell. Voldemont's special blood spell. It was terrible. Harry didn't have a chance.
Jori: Shut up Phil.
Me: And Ron. Decapitated. Wow. That was shocking.
Jori: Okay.
Me: And then when that Snape guy tore out Hermione's heart. Never saw it coming.
Jori: Anything else?
Me: Hm. Yeah, that guy with the beard. He's dead too. Shocking.
Jori: Go to hell."

In other news, a representative from Dove Chocolate booked our meeting room to have some sort of presentation. She calls us up today and says that she can't make it. We say ""Well we just received a few boxes in the mail for you. What should we do with them?""  She says ""Keep it.""

We now have five boxes of chocolate martini making kits and about forty packs of Dove chocolate covered almonds. OMG. Best day ever. I called dibs on one of the martini kits, which includes four nice martini glasses. Now I can drink with Chris Herb! We're also going to have a big Hampton party soon with icecream and chocolate martinis. We just need to go out a buy several different varieties of vodka. Best day ever."

"event","In honor of the 4th of July two day Twilight Zone marathon, I present you with my original idea for a Twilight Zone episode.

End of WW2. Hitler is in his bunker and the Allied Forces are closing in. Hitler weaps and says ""I am sorry for everything I did. I was a shitty ass person."" Then he shoots himself.

Hitler dies and appears in Purgatory. The angel of death is like ""Yo Adolf, we're sending you to Hell, but first they want to see you for a second in heaven. So Hitler shrugs his shoulders and is like ""Whatever.""

So he goes to heaven and St. Peter is there and says ""I know you repented for everything before you died, but you were a pretty shitty person. BUT we may be able to make a deal with you that lets you get into heaven.""


Hitler is like ""Huh?""

And St. Peter says ""We're sending you on a mission back in time. And we're giving you someone to help you.""

So they bring out Judas who has been locked up in hell for 2000 years. His hands are shackled and his robes are all burnt and stuff. And Judas is like ""HAHA. I""M JUDAS AND I""M EVIL.""

So St. Peter says ""We are giving both of you a mission. And if either of you are successful, we will let you both into heaven.""

So their first mission is to travel back in time and stop Judas from betraying Jesus. That's Hitler's mission. And Judas is there to help stop his past self.

Also, the Arch Angel gives them guns and jeeps to help them accomplish their mission.

So Hitler finds Judas on the night of the last supper and he is hiding behind a bush  waiting to put past Judas into a sack. Just as he is about to sack Judas, this jeep comes out of the woods and runs over Hitler.

And Judas is like ""HAHA. I""M STILL EVIL. I LIKE BEING IN HELL.""

And Hitler is like ""NOOOOOOOOOO!""

So they flash forward to WWII Germany.

And then I'm not sure what happens next. Lots of action and suspense. I'll have Dustin write this part. But in the end Hitler is able to stop Judas and stop his past self.

They flash back to heaven and St. Peter is like ""You did it. You're going to get into heaven.""

Judas and Hitler high five each other.

But St. Peter is like ""Wait, there's one more thing.""

And they're like ""Huh?""

St. Peter pulls off his mask and reveals that ""HAHA. You idiots. I'm actually Satan and I just managed to get the both of you into heaven. I am pure evil. HAHAHA.""

And Hitler screams ""NOOOOOOOO!"" And then the universe explodes and there is dramatic, twisty music. And the episode ends.


Please let me know what you think. 

Today, work started out really badly because things are so slow and there was nothing to do. But then I wrote this, which in itself is awesome. Now we're drinking lemonade and vodka and watching the Twilight Zone marathon. (for this episode, we drink every time that Talking Tina says something evil. and then we take two drinks every time the mom thinks that the dad is crazy).

After this, me and Steph are going to suck the helium out of some balloons. Awesome."

LEWISBURG, PA.  This town is notoriously ""cute"" with its quaint houses and little street shops. At the Lewisburg Street Fair they had a Pet Parade. (!) Dogs dressed up in cowboy (or cowgirl) hats. One dog appeared to be wearing a cape. But the other day, Catie and I saw something that took the town to a whole new level. We were walking by the Bull Run, and a line of ducks started to cross the street AT THE CROSSWALK! And there just so happened not to be any cars around. The ducks could have just floated down the stream. But no. They got out of the water, and walked across the street, AT THE CROSS WALK. It felt shockingly unreal. Like a mix of Hot Fuzz and The Truman Show.

VALLEY VIEW, PA.  Margot the puppy: As adorable as ever. But it recently occurred to me that I really wish I had a male puppy. Let me tell you why. Jack Russell Terrier abbreviated is JRT. So it occurs to me, that if I ever get a male Jack Russell, I will - nay - I MUST, name this puppy Jonathon Terrier Thomas. Then perhaps I could construct a dog house in the shape of 14 year old JTT's face.

NEW YORK, NY.  My brother proposed to his girlfriend on top of the Empire State Building. Just like in that movie! You know the one. The Empire Engagement Heist. No No. Empire Strikes Back. Personally, I would have proposed to her in Cloud City. Lando would have performed the ceremony. (and during the ceremony, the ring would shoot out of R2D2, right onto my lovely bride's finger)

Congratulations Josh. Holly is a catch for the following reasons:  1. She appreciates art.  2. She appreciates LOST.  3. She loves board games.  And that's pretty much all that you need. Good job brother."

"event","<p>Remember Jim Henson's Dinosaurs ? I sure do, especially since I've been watching a ton of episodes with my family the past few nights. My mom bought my dad the entire series on DVD for their anniversary. What a great gift. I suspect that the Get Smart box set will be part of my life by next year.

My mom never knows what to buy for my dad, but it usually ends up being pretty awesome (from my point of view at least). One year she bought him a copy of Star Wars Monopoly. Another time she got him some sort of R2 D2 rocket. Yes, a rocket in the shape of R2 D2. Seeing R2 sail through the air was a glorious sight.

In other news, part of my big toe nail fell off somehow. It stings like hell every time I walk. And I keep hitting it off of stuff. Shoes are unbearable, so I've stopped wearing them, even at work. That's right. Henceforth I am walking around the hotel in just socks. It's relaxing. Work doesn't really feel like work when you're just wearing socks. I recommend it to all of you.

And for those of you who haven't heard, I now have a new puppy, which just so happens to be the best puppy in the entire world. There was a litter we were waiting on, but then my mom found two other litters that were ready to take home. This was while I was on vacation, so I said they could get the puppy as long as they didn't give it a stupid name while I was gone. A few days later I called and they said that they were temporarily naming the dog Sasha. Ughhhhh. I wanted to name the dog Winnie Cooper. Not Winnie, but Winnie Cooper. It's a tribute to my first love. For a couple days it seemed like that could be the name, but then we had a family meeting and it became clear that Winnie wasn't going to win out.  I was afraid it would come down to pulling a name out of a hat, and I couldn't risk my puppy being named Sasha or Bridget. So I suggested the name Margot, a tribute to The Royal Tenenbaums. People liked it. And sooooo, I now have a puppy named Margot. I always knew that having a puppy would make my life a lot better, and I was right.</p>

"event","<p>Despite the fact that I've been dealing with primary immune deficiency since I was born, I feel like I'm still learning how best to deal with it. After I get my treatment there are usually about two days when I feel amazing and think ""Wow, this is the feeling of being completely healthy. If I could feel like this every day I could do anything."" After about a week I start to feel a decline. And the days right before I'm due for a treatment can be pretty rough sometimes.<br /><br />But I've been trying to take it easy, sleeping or taking naps when I start to feel worn down, and taking Tylenol or Nyquil when I feel really stuffed up but trying not to overdo it with the medicine like I did in Colorado. (I think that happened b/c my sleep schedule was not really what I liked)&nbsp;<br /><br />Now I think I need to add some cardiovascular workouts to my routine. Usually I don't feel awake until I can do my pushups or spend some time lifting my 25 pound hand weights. But even after that I sometimes don't feel right. Like this morning I was just feeling out of it. I couldn't focus. Didn't feel ready to start my day. So finally (inspired by Dustin Kaster's recent exploits)&nbsp; i went out to the shed and wheeled out my old bike. Kendra used it at some point last summer or the summer before and managed to screw up my seat and break my kickstand. I'm STILL really unhappy about that and tempted to rip the kickstand off of her bike.. but I will do my best to be a good big brother.<br /><br />So anyways, I fixed my seat, oiled everything up and took my bike for a ride up to the high school and back. It feels good to be exercising again. My legs aren't as strong as they used to be. The other day I was playing basketball with Ryan and my leg went out on me when I tried to make&nbsp;a layup. And it's not like Ryan was guarding me or anything, it was just me casually going up for a shot then falling. A group of slightly more athletic nerds were playing basketball at the other side of the court and took a moment to laugh at me. It was, admittedly, quite funny. </p><p>It's time to get back my legs back to what they once were. In high school I was all about riding my bike. One summer I rode 250 + miles, including when I rode twenty five miles in one day. And I'm sure none of you have forgotten that I won first place in the fifty yard dash in sixth grade. Keep in mind, it was against the rest of the sixth grade as well as all fourth and fifth grade. Wow. One of the crowning achievements of my life, to be sure. Even better than when I came in second in the first grade potato sack race.<br /><br />That's enough about bikes. I don't want this to become like Matt's old blog. ""Nothing is going on. Classes are okay. I rode four miles today. I miss my girlfriend. It sucks. World War II blah blah blah.""<br /><br />There's another feat of greatness that I must share with the world: Tuesday night's BullRun trivia victory. What can I say? We had everything going for us. Pouring rain kept some people away. All Yuenglings were on special. The questions were easy. The stars aligned and the Polymorphic Pierogies walked out of trivia night a hundred dollars richer. Oh, and we won two slices of pizza. I'd say this was my biggest accomplishment since graduating. Awesome. Eat your heart out Angela Lansbury!</p>"

"event","<strong>Last Book Read</strong>: The Shipping News by Annie Proulx. Interesting writing style, full of choppy half sentences. Most of the book was good, not mind blowing. But the ending was an absolute knockout. I feel like its hard to find books with&nbsp;really great endings. Quoyle was a great character.<br /><br /><strong>Currently Reading</strong>: Where I'm Caling From by Raymond Carver. This was a partial re-read. I have to say, that I have really mixed feelings about the first half of this book. Of course there's nothing wrong with stories about ordinary moments in ordinary lives, but I also think that if you're going to show a certain moment of a characters life, then it should lead to something significant - some small epiphany, anything. So there were a bunch of these stories that I thought were kind of pointless. But once you get about halfway into the book, every story is a knockout.<br /><br /><strong>Next Book I'll Read</strong>: I was hoping to read something short next, but all of the books I had in mind are really long. Maybe Couples by John Updike, American Pastoral by Philip Roth, The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, or The Chronicle of a Death Foretold by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.&nbsp; I'd like to get my hands on 100 Years of Solitude or Love in the Time of Choleria, but Catie had a copy of Chronicle of a Death Foretold and it's short, so I'll probably read that next. Oh, also I want to read Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens because (on LOST) it is the last book Desmond is going to read before he dies. Annnd I have heard a lot of great things about Our Mutual Friend.<br /><br /><strong>Current Magazines</strong>: Rivercraft featuring award winning poems by Sara Basher. Also, the Newsweek featuring Leadership and the Environment. Arnold Schwarzenegger was kind of a dick during his first years in office, but he has redeemed himself by showing how governors and business leaders can step up and have a big impact on protecting the environment proving that you don't need the help of the the President or the federal government. This was a great companion piece to the eleven page article by Thomas Friedman that recently appeared in the New York Times, titled ""The Power of Green."" Another must read.<br /><br /><strong>Last Album I bought</strong>: Neon Bible by The Arcade Fire. I almost never buy CDs because my money has obligations elsewhere. But I wnated to help send the message that indie bands can sell lots of records, too. And they did end up like second on Billboard the week of their release. Anyways, you have to have this album. So many great tracks, my favorite being ""No Cars Go.""<br /><br /><strong>Last Album I listened to</strong>: Franz Ferdinand<br /><br /><strong>Last Concert I Saw</strong>: The Decemberists at Messiah. Incredible, even though they didn't play anything off of Picaresque. Best songs played: The Landlord'd Daughter, Perfect Crime 1 &amp; 2, and A Cautionary Song, dedicated to Maggie S.<br /><br /><strong>Last Movie I Saw In Theaters</strong>: Volver starring Penelope Cruz. I've seen a lot of great Spanish movies and seeing this was further incentive to fill my netflix queue with even more. This is also what made me want to get into some Gabriel Garcia Marquez books. Two great things about this movie: interesting play on magic realism and interesting presentation of Penelope Cruz's boobs.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Last Movie I Netflixed</strong>: Secretary<br /><br /><strong>Current Netflix movies</strong>: Shopgirl. El Mariachi. Pulp Fiction.<br /><br /><strong>TV I'm Watching</strong>: LOST, The Larry Sanders Show, Survivor, The Apprentice. I almost always forget to watch The Office and 30 Rock, even though they are amazing. <br /><br /><strong>Wikipedia Lookups</strong>: Mostly I just use Wikipedia to look up comic book stuff, haha. So recently I read articles about Gambit, Sage, Cannonball, Husk, Danielle Moonstar and the villains of Spiderman. Awesome."

"event","When I was a kid I could never understand the concept of Easter presents. I was a Jehovah's Witness so I didn't get presents for any holiday. But I could at least understand it for other things. Birthdays, celebration of life. Christmas, Jesus was born, fantastic! But Easter? Jesus died on the cross so I get a new bike.&nbsp;&nbsp;What? How is that fair? Remember that part in the Bible where Jesus died, was raised three days later, then spent the whole day riding his new Huffy? I don't.

Someone had in their away message ""I have only one Easter wish."" Easter wish? What? There are no wishes. Not for Easter and not for any other holiday. You start granting a wish for every holiday and it's just going to snowball into people wanting everyday wishes. ""My Monday wish is to find someone who truly loves me for who I am.""

If I did have an easter wish, I'd say it came true. First, I got to watch the end of Mean Girls - AGAIN b/c I just saw it last night. Then my boss gave me some chocolate eggs. Followed up by Catie bringing me Easter dinner AND PIE. And now I'm going to see Grindhouse. You can't get more Easter than Rose MacGowan murdering zombies with her gun leg.

Also, it snowed, which is like an easter miracle sort of. It has snowed on pretty much every holiday this year. It's kind of like Batman's The Long Halloween. Except instead of someone being gruesomely murdered on each holiday, it, you know, snows. Sometimes its just flurries. ... Yeah.&nbsp;

One last thing. I'd like to congratulate Dustin Kaster for finally have his own page on IMDB. This is pretty much the pinnacle of success. I hear he's rumored to be in the fourth installment of the Indiana Jones Chronicles. Way to go buddy!"

"event","<p>Randolph Mantooth is in the hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp; OH&nbsp;&nbsp; MY&nbsp;&nbsp; GOD. RIght now his butler/driver is sitting in the lobby drinking coffee, watching A Knights Tale, and talking to little kids about swimming. Also, I suspect that the butler may be a robot butler. I know this because robots LOVE A Knights Tale.&nbsp; Irregardless, Randolph Mantooth is now on the official Phil Celebrity list. To date, the biggest celebrity who I have seen at the hotel is Jeri Ryan, Star Trek Voyager's Seven of Nine, who I slept with. Then there's the Breaking Benjamin lead singer who I beat the shit out of. If you don't remember these things, then I recommend you look back and read the complete history of my LJ, because I""m too busy mingling with celebrities to tell you about it.<br /><br />Lots of things have happened lately, so I'll tell you about some of it. A couple weeks ago, Jordan, Bubblehead, Dustin, Big Tuna and myself all enjoyed what will from now on be referred to as ""A Night of Beards and Guitars."" It went like this. We all waited in line for a long time, forty minutes I'd say, then some girl came by and mumbled ""everybody here has their tickets right?"" and Chris knew the girl and said ""Of course"" and she went on down the line and I'm like ""Wait, we don't have our tickets."" In fact, Chris was the only one who actually had his ticket. So I looked around for a second to see where the Will Call ticket thing was, but at that moment the line started moving. So we got up to the front and saw the will call line, waited in that for five or ten minutes, and completely lost our spot in line. Except for Chris, who went inside. How do you save a space for your friends when it's standng room? Basically you just stand in one spot, put out your arms and spin around in a circle. </p><p>Anyways, eventually we got in and found Chris. Problem solved. And did I mention that Maggie wasn't there? She's never ""there"". David Bazan played and was awesome. First he did a cover of ""Hallelujah."" In my opinion there are enough versions of that song already, but his was different from any other that I've heard. The only Pedro the Lion song he played was ""Transcontinental"" which is my favorite Pedro song. Also, he played a great song called... Asshole, I think. He talked to the audience a lot. But, because we're idiots. we forget to request ""Big Trucks"" even though Jordan, Dustin and myself yell out that request at every other show we go to. We forgot to request it the one time that the performer legitimately could have played the song. We are dumbasses. Then the guy from Iron and Wine came on. I really liked his act, even though I didn't know any of the songs. However, I hated him because he was like ""You guys dont have to stand. You can all sit on the floor."" Right off I knew that would be a horrible idea. By the time he was done my legs, back and neck were all killing me. Also, we requested that Jim Bean play ""Big Trucks"" cuz by this time we realized our mistake, but he wouldn't play it. He said ""I don't really practice very much at all. So, you can request a song, and if its next on this list I wrote, then I'll play it.""</p><p>Other things: I""m back to full time at the Hampton and I don't have to vacuum the hallways anymore. Although, that cleaning gig wasn't all that bad. I had a lot of freedom to just walk around and talk to people. Oh well. Front desk is my realm anyways. Give me my chair and my internet and I'm set. Having a full paycheck is nice too. Not to mention my nice tax return, and the fact that I'm now completely done dealing with my Colorado apartment. Thank God. I just need to delete my landlords number from my phone as a final act of purging. I've got to get my financial situation back in order. Finding cheaper car and health insurance is a must. Right now I'm fighting with my health insurance to pay a nine thousand dollar bill.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alot of my time has been taken up by FUSE lately. It's great having a team of people who I can count on. And it means I get to spend more time with Sara Basher. We've been working like crazy to get everything ready in time for the AWP conference, and we managed to do it, even if it was down to the wire. And speaking of Sara, we had a brother/sister night last week. We went to Lewisburg, and ate at Zeldas then went to the Campus Theatre to see Notes on a Scandal (which was fantastic) This was followed up by listening to ""Your Covers Blown"" a couple times. I""ve probably heard that song a hundred times since I've been home.<br /><br />What else? There was a big party at Catie's a few weeks ago. Sal, Jordan and Ryan came by. I don't remember alot about it except for the drinking part. But it was awesome. </p>"

"event","<p>Last week Catie told me about a 50BookChallenge group on Livejournal. So I've decided that I'm going to read fifty books this year. I've only read two so far, so I'm starting from behind. But I should be able to do it. Hopefully this will keep me on track. Every other year I promise myself that I'm going to catch up on my reading... and then I just catch up on being a lazy piece of shit instead. So, no more of that. READING! WRITING! Whooo!&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, here's a review I wrote for Best American Nonrequired Reading of 2006. <br /><br /><br />One thing that really struck me about this collection is that it had a very international feel to it, especially considering that it is part of the Best AMERICAN series. There are a few pieces that focus on Iraq. The Best American Excerpt From a Military Blog is a nice compliment to&nbsp;The Insurgent's Tale, and both give a much more personal view of the Iraq War than we usually get from the media. There is also a propaganda piece that America unsuccessfuly tried to plant in the Iraqi media, and a full copy of the Iraqi Constiution which I skipped over, because honestly, who would want to read that from beginning to end? Not me.<br /><br />The international theme continues with an essay about the seven star hotel and other attractions in Dubai, a comic about Kim Jung Il's image in North Korea, and a memoir about becoming naturalized in America. There are also short stories from an Egyptian writer and a Japanese writer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Overall, the fiction definitely isn't at the same quality level as in Best American Short Stories, but there are a few good pieces, one called ""Peg"" by Sam Shaw and a good story from Rick Moody. But the only story I considered to be a real knock out was Haruki Murakami's ""The Kidney Shaped Stone that Moves Every Day."" It was fantastic. What made this volume great was the consistently good nonfiction. There are three spectacular pieces from Julia Sweeney (Pat!), Kurt Vonnegut and David Foster Wallace. Michael Lewis' essay on Hurricane Katrina also really stood out to me, despite the many essays I've previously read about the Hurricane.&nbsp;<br /><br />In addition to all of this, there are a few really interesting things included that really make this series special. Things like ""The Best American Fake Headlines from The Onion"",&nbsp; ""The Best American First Sentences of Novels of 2005"" and ""The Best American Answers to the Question 'What Do You Believe Is True Even Though You Cannot Prove It?' ""&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and I can't forget the introduction from Matt Groening and the excerpt from the ""Me You and Everyone We Know"" screenplay.<br /><br />All in all, this collection is just enjoyable to read. I'd recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />1. My Name Is Red - Orhan Pamuk<br />2. Best American Nonrequired Reading - Dave Eggers</p>"

"event","<p>Good things that have happened:<br /><br />1. LOST is back! Last night I went over to Snake House for LOST night. They have strict rules. You can't talk during the show, unless it's a short statement like ""Holy Shit"" or ""Oh Man"". And you're not allowed to criticize the episode until it is over. Apparently Geoff Stokes was almost killed after he continued the criticize the show WHILE IT WAS ON. I'd say that's a sin worthy of execution. Anyways, LOST was awesome last night. Best episode of the season so far.</p><p>2. Yesterday I helped Steph clean out her mom's house. She had one of those cat clocks laying around and said I could have it. So now I have one! It's missing the tail, but it shouldn't be too hard to build one.</p><p>3. After helping Steph I hung out with Sister Basher for a few hours. We are friends.<br /><br />4.Last weekend Angie threw a GroundHogs day party in the basement of Scholars House. It was a Pennsylvania Party, with only PA food and drink. Pierogies, Tasty Cakes, Hershey Bars, Soopy, Guers, Birch Beer. We watched Groundhog Day and then arm wrestled. Devin lost to Angie. Goood times. After that was over we went to ...<br /><br />5. The Pirate Party! We wore eye patches and carried swords and DANCED OUR ASSES OFF! Man, what a good time. It was Catie's first time at TRAX. It was like a baptism of sorts. Also, I won a glow in the dark pencil sharpener. Doesn't get more exciting than that.&nbsp;<br /><br />6. After TRAX, I went back to Catie's place. It was such a great day that I told Catie we should be ""all official and stuff."" So now we are. It's even on facebook. Can't get any more official than that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Things are good.</p>"

"event","<p>First off, let me write about&nbsp;the party where Dustin made a fool of himself, also known as the alternate universe party, also known as Kim and Justin's duel birthday party of greatness. So, Kramer met me at the hotel and we drove down to Harrisburg together. On the way Dustin called us.<br /><br />Dustin: Where are you?<br />Me: On our way to the party.<br />Dustin. Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....&nbsp; This party is awesome!!!<br /><br />Immediately after that call we saw a car had exploded on the other side of the highway. I've never seen a car explode like that. The flames were two stories high. It was pretty great. Clearly the car was struck by an awesome beam that had escaped from Kim's party.<br /><br />So the party was held at this place right by the Capital. It used to be&nbsp;a church, now it's a VFW with a German name. It was great. The drinks were dirt cheap (1.25 for a beer. Like 3 bucks for a mixed drink. And this is right in the heart of the city) we had the entire upstairs to ourselves (with a nice dance floor and balcony) annnd the bartender was really hot. (not that I care about that) We were afraid that a bunch of people from highschool would show up (read, people we hate) but it turned out that only two showed up. This is where the alternate universe part kicks in. They were all popular and stuff in high school, but when they walked into the party they realized that they didn't really know anyone there so they sat at a table by themselves, talking only to each other, then moved to the bar by themselves to talk to talk to each other. MEANWHILE me and Dustin and Chris and Jess etc all DANCED OUR ASSES OFF and drank and had amazing fun.<br /><br />Here's the other alternate universe element. Dustin told Jackie to come to the party. You may remember her as ""Hey, you got on your face."" Dustin was talking to her and, it seemed, doing pretty well with her. She was drunk this time so a lot more outgoing and fun than at the New Years party. It seemed like Dustin may actually get to kiss her by the end of night. (!!!) But then, me and Dustin go up to the bar to get drinks, and as we're waiting, this other girl comes up Dustin, and she's like ten times hotter than Jackie. She says something like ""Hi, I'm Joanna. What's your name?"" and he says ""I'm Dustin, can&nbsp;i buy you a drink.""&nbsp;Something like that. So he buys a drink for Hot Joanna while I question why the fabric of the universe has just been torn apart.&nbsp;<br /><br />I went downstairs to call the hotel and tell them to clock me out (yes, I was still being paid at this point) and to call Catie. Then I'm like ""i gotta go. Fitty Cent is playing"" because he was and I go upstairs and Kim and Justin have this AMAZING choreographed dance thing going on. I've never seen anything like it.<br /><br />Later we're dancing and I tell Dustin that he hasn't talked to Jackie for a while so he should concentrate his efforts on Hot Joanna. But he says ""No no no. I think I can make out with both girls."" Well, can anyone guess how this story ended?<br /><br />I had to work in the morning, so Kramer and I drove back to the hotel and got a room together. Hot ta ta. Overall, the night was fantastic. Danced to lots of Michael Jackson. Had some great cake. Got to hang out with Kramer, who I hadn't seen in two years. And even hanging out with Chris was cool. Hehe. Oh Chris.</p><p>Also, in case you didn't guess already, Dustin didn't make out wih anyone. Oh Dustin. But he bought everyone drinks. Yeah Dustin!</p>"

"event","<p>Here's an update about what's going on in my life. First off, have you people seen Prince William's girlfriend, Kate Middleton. Wow, she is really hot. There hasn't been a new hotgirl this hot since Kiera Knightly. Not to say that Kiera Knightly isn't still hot, because she is. A few years ago Dustin and I went to see ""Bend it Like Beckham"" because it was getting lots of good reviews and it was supposed to be all indie and stuff. After seeing it we were blown away by how crappy it was, ""BUT"" we said, ""who was that outrageously hot girl?"" Turns out it was Kiera Knightly. A few months after that, we went to Bethany Beach with Al, Chris, Kim and Jess and we saw Pirates of the Caribbean. None of us were really expecting much because, c'mon, it's based off of an amusement park ride. Dustin and I left the theater and&nbsp;were blown away by how entertaining the movie turned out to be, ""AND"", we said, ""who was that outrageoulsy hot girl?"" Turns out it was Kiera Knightly... AGAIN. Wow. After that we played Pirate themed mini golf. AMAZING.<br /><br />So.... I guess that pretty much covers everything I know about Kate Middleton. Here is a list of other hot girls: Natalie Portman. Maggie Gylenhaal, Kiera Knightly, Emmy Rossum, Kate from LOST, annnnnnd Winona forever. Yeah. <br /><br />Lately I""ve been really into ""Album of the Year"" by the Good Life. I've had this album for (I think) two years now, but every time I listen to it I love it more. I originally heard about it from this girl named Jennie who I talked to briefly over MySpace. She went to Bloom and was indie as fuck and I was like ""I'm already on Myspace so why not message some people."" So we talked a few times, and I asked her what some of her favorite Rilo Kiley songs were, because I was working on a mix cd for Amy. She said ""Figures Standing in a Vast Expanse"" was her favorite Rilo Kiley song of all time. Then I said that song was okay, but not nearly one of my favorites. She replied with ""Well then you have crappy taste in Rilo Kiley"" and we never talked again. Ha. Later, Dustin talked to her online for a little while until he said ""Let's meet"" and then they never spoke again. We saw her at a few concerts, like when we saw the Brunettes, and most recently when we saw Tilly in Philly (part two). Even though she had burned both Dustin and I, Jordan wanted to talk to her. His plan: to yell ""LOST!"" over and over again, in hopes that she would talk to him about how awesome LOST is. The plan did not work.<br /><br />So anyways, she wrote an end of the year ""BEST CDs"" list, and ""Album of the Year"" by the Good Life was on the list. Then I bought it. Cool. Sidenote, I think she had ""Digital Ash in A DIgital Urn"" as her top CD of that year. Pffff. Fuck you Bright Eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a list of some other songs that I'm really into right now: ""Your Covers Blown"" by Belle and Sebastian, and ""Hey Hey My My"" by Neil Young.&nbsp;<br /><br />A guest staying at the hotel had four cats in the room. We deemed one of the cats ""The Stephen King Kitty"" because it HAD A HOLE IN ITS HEAD! Right between the eyes. It wasn't just a little indentation or something. It was a gaping hole! Plus the cat had this creepy Darth Vader breathing thing going on. Yuck. It was frightening.<br /><br />For the past couple months I've been reading this book called ""My Name Is Red"" by the latest Nobel Prize winner, Orhan Pamuk. It started strong, but now it's kind of painful to get through. I have a real problem being interested in books that take place in the distant past or in foreign countries. This book takes place in 16th century Istanbul. Ugh. The story is told through the POV of roughly a dozen characters. Some of the more daring POVs come from a corpse at the botoom of a well, a coin, a&nbsp;painting of a dog, and the color red. Cool. Looking forward to moving onto a different book.<br /><br />Lastly, FUSE has been making a lot of progress lately. There's actually a team of people who seem genuinely interested in the project. This is a big change from when Dr. Fincke told me that FUSE was about number fifteen on his list of priorities for the writing program. Ouch. We have a web guy now, so the burden of fixing the site is taken off of my shoulders. I've been working on updating the lists of every graduate and undergraduate writing program in the country, as well as every literary magazine. It's a lot of work, but I don't mind it.</p><p>I'd like to get back to writing some short stories and maybe rework my old screenplay (or start a new one). Also, I've been casually thinking about grad schools and the GREs. It would be nice to get the GREs out of the way before summer.</p>"

So by the time it comes to Phil Day we need some drink free fun. </p><p>In the morning my mom and I went shopping so I could find a bookshelf. No luck. Then we went to Brothers Chinese Buffet for lunch. Every birthday should have a chinese buffet. </p><p>Next, I took a nap. Man, my birthday just kept getting better and better.<br /><br />Thennnnn BOWLING. Alex, Dustin and I drove to Pottsville and met Chris and Catie there. Maggie couldn't make it. :(&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, bowling is amazing. But get this. The price per game goes up at 5:00. So we go to pay for our games and we're like ""We started our second game at 4:55"" and the woman says ""Okay. Well I'm going to charge you the after five rate for that.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT?!&nbsp;&nbsp; She may have been mad b/c we brought in outside drink. But in all fairness, their soda machine didn't have anything good. And when she saw us bring it in she said we couldn't have it, so we didn't drink it. Despite the fact that we were REALLY THIRSTY.&nbsp;<br /><br />My next birthday wish was to eat at Chik Fil A. They invented the chicken sandwich.<br /><br />Next, Schuylkill Mall arcade. The five of us had a ski ball competition. Then we played this horrible game where you were a jockey on a horse. Worst arcade game ever. Then there was racing and Catie gator whacking and Dustin Hoth Battling and air hockeying and pooling. Then we all chewed gum.<br /><br />It was a good birthday.</p>"

"event","DAY BEFORE NEW YEARS

I want this post to be over, so here are some brief highlights.

- Stroking Jordan's luscious beard as he slept (like an angel)
- Tripping on the sidewalk and doing a complete wipeout, with only minor injury to myself and a slight tear in my Dunkin Donuts bag. Thank God I didn't buy coffee
- Watching the Twilight Zone Marathon
- Listening to the Crane Wife and Pedro the Lion on&nbsp; the drive home

So thennnn, we had a few hours to kill before leaving for the New Years Party, so everyone went home for a bit, and Jordan joined me at my place. We really weren't sure what we could at my place for four or five hours. Then we realized we could just watch EVEN MORE of the Twilight Zone marathon on SciFi. Awesome. We saw lots of classic episodes like ""Eye of the Beholder"" which was actually really bad. It would have been good as maybe a ten minute episode, but they just kept dragging it out. I swear there are about three solid minutes where you just watch the doctors unwrap bandages from her face and say ""Only one more layer"" and ""You know there's no guarantee this surgery will make you look normal."" Then there was the one where William Shatner sees a gremlin on the wing of his airplane. This episode remains my favorite. Also there was an episode where three US soldiers somehow travel back in time to help General Custer fight Indians. That didn't really make any sense. And the one where Bill Mumy plays an evil little kid who can make people disappear. It made us realize that a lot of the episodes didn't even have a big twist. You get to the end and you just think ""Man, that was a fucked up situation. Hope that never happens to me."" 

All in all we probably watched Twilight Zone for four or five hours. Then my brother's girlfriend, Holly, and her parents came to the house, so Jordan and I got to meet them. This was the first parental meeting, so everyone was dressed very nice. Except for my dad who was wearing my old Star Wars Episode One t-shirt. Fantastic. 

At this point Maggie decided she didn't want to go to Dillsburg anymore, which pretty much ruined 2007 for me. But shortly after that I got a call from Alex asking if he could join us. So we drove to Chris's old apartment building and met up with his friend Hot Jackie, or Jackie as she preferred to be called. Dustin was peeing behind a bush when she pulled in, driving right past him. She saw Chris and asked ""Was that your friend peeing behind the bush?"" Add that to the list of girls who have seen Dustin's penis. 

We drove to the party, walked in and met a bunch of people, but I forgot all of their names about five seconds later. Oh well. Kim Holland was there! For a while Dustin, Chris, Alex, Jordan and myself stood together awkwardly drinking Yuengling. Then we talked to Hot Jackie for awhile. I talked to her about impurities. (she's a chemist. YOU wouldn't understand) Then Dustin was trying to talk to her and he opened up a new beer which sprayed out everywhere, namely on the carpet and Dustin's jeans. It was a cheap attention grabbing trick, I'm sure. 

Then some kids wrestled, and we watched Strangers With Candy, blah blah blah and THEN we went to the middle of Dillsburg to see the Pickle Drop. The pickle (which seemed to be dressed as some sort of sea captain) was lowered by a crane. There was no countdown. It seemed to take a good twenty seconds for it to come down, and then when it hit the bottom ""2007"" lit up, and sparks started shooting from the pickle. Also, this definitely seemed to happen a minute or two before the REAL midnight. Good job Mr. Mayor. We yelled ""Whooooooooo"" a lot and ""07!"" and hugged lots of people and screamed more. Then fireworks started to go off! But the crowd was positioned in such a way that there were buildings obstructing our view of the fireworks. But they sounded great.

We tried to gather everyone together to get back to the party. While waiting, Dustin noticed that Jackie's mascara was running and told her ""Hey, you got crap on your face."" While Jordan was telling me about this and cracking up, we heard Dustin say ""No, no, it's still there."" Then they DIDN'T make out. 

Back at the party we talked to Kim about how great Wikipedia was. She and Jordan exchanged fascinating things they had learned. I didn't have much to contribute b/c I usually use Wikipedia more as a way to look up comic book character histories than for actual learning. Like, today I read the entire Wolverine entry. It was fantastic.&nbsp; Then I was sitting next to Dustin and he tried to take a sip of my beer or something, and my beer foamed up and sprayed everywhere! Ugh. So I set it down between the two of us and less than a minute later he accidentally knocked it over again. Ack. But it was okay.

The rest of the night is kindof foggy for me. Me and Jordan danced to Kim's dance mix for a whle. ""Can't Stop til You Get Enough"" is definitely by favorite dance song of all time. Then people watched Kung Pow, and we talked about Arrested Development quotes and then Kim slept between me and Dustin. She snored very loudly."

"event","<p>After hours spent staring out his window, Dustin Kaster saw a shooting star and a series of birthday wishes. The next morning, it is announced by the news media that Suddam Hussein has been executed AND his hanging is on YouTube. Birthday wish number one; FULFILLED!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; (He's just a big YouTube fan. Doesn't really care about this whole Iraq thing)</p><p>Our journey begins!&nbsp; Maggie, Chris, Jordan and myself depart. Trip highlights. Maggie buys contact lens solution. Jordan eats two chicken sandwiches. We miss our exit. Dustin's birthday is ruined. We get on Route one south. Then travel further and further south of Dustin's apartment, yet miraculously arrive somewhere in Philly, north of his place.&nbsp;BIRTHDAY MIRACLE. Dustin then gives us further directions and we end up at the Naval Yard. We made jokes about boats and stuff. THEN we finally got to his place.<br /><br />Next we headed to ChinaTown for some dinner. Jordan pointed out rats on the subway rails. Good job Jordan! The food was fantastic but our waiter refused to allow us control over our ice water pitcher. We kept putting it on the food wheel thing and he kept taking it off. Pfff. Doesn't sound like the America I know.<br /><br />Bed. I slept with Jordan on the futon. We got into a discussion about if Batman was Jewish would he have a barmitzvah or a BATmitzvah. It went on way too long. <br /><br />After that we strolled South Street and went in a great comic book shop. There were a bunch of police officers guarding the cities most valuable assets. Also, they were playing Return of the Jedi on the TV. Awesome. The store had a fine selection of erotic comics.&nbsp;I searched in vain for a comic I heard about in which F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce all live together in dog form, and instead of writing novels they write comic books. Unfortunately they didn't seem to have it. Even so, I'm happy just knowing such a comic exists.After looking at comics for a while, some kids standing nearby said ""Why aren't we at a bar?""&nbsp; and we all looked at each other and were like ""Yeah, let's start drinking.""<br /><br />First bar&nbsp;&nbsp;we stopped at was Tattooed Moms. Great place. Dustin spent twenty minutes regretting that he ordered a beer instead of a mixed drink. Chris drew a penis on a pillow. It wasn't funny. Many mixed drinks go by, then Dustin sees two girls and says ""I wish those girls would kiss."" A minute or two later THEY DO KISS! And not just once, but three or four times! Birthday miracle number two: FULFILLED! Unfortunately, Dustin was looking away each time so he missed it. But Jordan and I saw it, so that's all that matters. </p><p>Next we went to a bar near Dustin's apartment. We ate wings and drank more beer. Then Jordan played ""With or Without You"" on the jukebox. I don't remember much else about that.<br /><br />On the way back to Dustin's apartment we argued and stuff. Dustin said something insensitive then Maggie shoved it against the railing of his apartment building. Their&nbsp; faces were very close to each other, I was fairly sure Maggie could kill him, and Dustin was very drunk so I said ""Whatever you do, don't kiss her.""&nbsp;<br /><br />Upstairs, Maggie and Chris argued. I thought the argument involved me, but it never got to that part, so I joined Dustin and Jordan in the other room where they were watching Kill Bill, except for when Dustin stuck his head into the kitchen and yelled ""SHUUT UPPP!""<br /><br />Bed. I slept with Jordan on the futon. There was minimal touching. We had an argument about, if Batman was Jewish would he have a Barmitzvah or a BATmitzvah. It went on for about twenty minutes too long. After that, I decided the night should be deemed BATurday. Oh, and for the record, Dustin was more drunk than anyone else. He always is. <br /></p>"

"event","<p>Dear internet,<br /><br />Do I look any older to you? Hm. Interesting. Not sure why that is. Oh, wait. It's because I'M 23 YEARS OLD NOW. WHOOOO!!! First order of twenty three year old business, Gerald Ford: DEAD. AGAIN! Now, everyone seems to have that vague suspicion that Ford was already dead. Of course, we have no way to prove that because Free Masons destroyed all of those files years ago. I suspect that this was some sort of ploy by the media to infuse a boring news week with some purpose. A boring purpose, albeit, but a purpose nonetheless. His body has been touring the country for what seems like one hundred days or more. Perhaps, this is Ford's calling as President. Just keep that casket on wheels and let it travel across America until the end of time. This is a great idea, but will never happen because his body is due to go back in storage so the media can pull this stunt on us again in another ten years. Everyone will have that nagging feeling that Ford ""died years ago"", but once again will be unable to prove anything. This entry will have been deleted by the NSA by then.&nbsp;<br /><br />And another thing, why don't they tour Suddam Hussein's body around the country like this? He was at least elected into office. Take that Ford!<br /><br />Last night I was feeling pretty exhausted. So after eating dinner (leftovers) I took a nap (accidentally sleeping through The Knights of Prosperity premier). When I wokr up I felt really sick to my stomach. My mom said ""I hope you're not getting what your dad had. He felt really nauseus for three days."" Oh no. But I took some pepto and watched a documentary about Annie Leibovitz, then some Futurama, and started to feel better. Then I went back to sleep and woke up around twoish, feeling like complete hell. Couldn't stop coughing, congestion times twelve. In my half-awake state I tried to fall back to sleep, and had a bizarre dream. I was in lyaing in bed, feeling awful, in the exact same position I truly was in, but there was a man on my bed wearing a very nice blue suit. Next to me was an old man sitting in a chair with an IV running to his arm. The man in the blue suit explained to me that he was sorry, but they needed me to be in the body of this old man for the night. He wasn't strong enough to go through this right now, so I would have to. It would be over soon, though, he said, and I would feel okay again. ""But I'll think this was all a dream, won't I?"" i asked, and he said yes.</p><p>Creepy. Meredith said that people tend to have really fucked up dreams when they're sick. And I do need to get my treatment asap. Maybe this dream was symbolic of the fact that I'm an old now. An old old man like Gerald Ford. (livejournal. circle)</p>"

"event","Let me apologize in advance for my longwinded responses to everything, but 2006 was jampacked, and I only get to do one retrospective a year (or do I?) so deal with it. Also, I added some categories that Dustin foolishly neglected to include on the survey.

Best Accomplishment:&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. MOVING TO COLORADO. Living 1600 miles away from everyone and everything I've ever known was pretty huge in the scope of my life. Having to take care of an apartment and cook every meal made me much more independent than I already was.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. MOVING BACK HOME. Making a 1600 mile drive by myself was pretty huge in itself. But more than that, I came to terms with the fact that things were not working out in Colorado and I'd have to move back home to get my life back in order. And that's okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. WINNING THE ESSAY AWARD. It didn't happen until the semester after I graduated, but I finally accomplished all of my ""Writing Major Goals"" that I set for myself during freshman year. They were to get published, to be editor of a magazine, to become one of the best fiction writers in the major, to introduce a visiting writer, and to win a writing prize. I already won two or three runner up prizes, which I was happy with, but it was nice to get this, too. And I couldn't have made it home without the money.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. WINNING&nbsp;THE HOUSE AND SENATE!!!!&nbsp; Technically, this wasn't me per se. It was actually the Democrats. But wow, all of that obsessing over politics ended with a huge payoff. Amazing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. GRADUATING! Out of all of my accomplishments, this was probably the most underwhelming, but it was nice I suppose.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Best CD: Decemberists - The Crane Wife.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I don't really about new, cutting edge music very much.

Best Concert: I don't remember very many concerts from this year. Ben Folds was pretty good. But my favorite was probably The New West Fest. First I got to see The Motet cover only Michael Jackson songs. The ""Can't Stop Til You Get Enough"" finale was amazing. Then I rocked out unimaginably hard to the B-52s. Awesome.

Best Movie: 1. The Departed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The Prestige
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Little Miss Sunshine


Worst Movie: Holy shit. I was disappointed by almost every single movie I saw, even XMEN 3!!! Jesus. Superman Returns and Scanner Darkly were also letdowns. The only thing that saved me was that I hardly saw any movies in theaters.

Best Books: 1. Little Children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The End of the Affair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Lolita
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The Grace that Keeps this World

Best TV Show: While in Colorado I watched the entire series of LOST to date, WHICH WAS MINDBLOWINGLY AWESOME. Also, the first half of Nip/Tuck's fourth season was AMAZING.

Worst TV Show: Second half of Nip/Tuck's fourth season. Man, that sucked ass. What happened???

Best LJ Entry: The Dustin Love Entry Hall of Fame. HILARIOUS.

Person of the Year: SARA BASHER!!! She is the most hilarious person I have met since Jordan/Sal. ... sounds like less of an accomplishment when I mention Sal. Just kidding. I love Sal. But anyways, Sara is my little sister and I love her to death. I think she will remain one of my best friends for many, many years. Also, honorable mention for Dustin who accomplished a lot this year, and Colorado Devin, who was hilarious. Oh, and JOHN LOCKE!!!

Biggest Disappointment: 1. Things not working out in Colorado. 2. Getting screwed on health insurance. 3. Not getting to travel to more places in and around Colorado. 4. Not becoming better friends with CSU Devin.

What one thing about the past year would you change: Nothing major. Write more instead of being a piece of shit.

Greatest memory of the past year: Everything about Haturday.

Biggest wish for 2007: That all of my problems are magically solved. Oh, and that I have something published in a nice magazine. I'd realy like to get my life back in order, overall.

Anything to look forward to: Writing. Submitting to literary magazines. Applying to grad schools. Working on FUSE a lot. Paying off some debt. Improving my health and hearing. Spending lots of time with my friends."

"event","In two weeks I must travel sixteen hundred miles in three days by myself and my car still has not heat. My only prayer for a safe return may be a heat wave in middle of December, which is not entirely unlikely considering how sporatic the weather has been lately.&nbsp;

The cold itself doesn't bother me. If I had to I would wear three layers and wrap myself under blankets. But if I can't defrost my windows then I can't see. Driving further south might solve some problems. Or maybe I'd be better off doing a non stop bolt across the country. Wait for an opening in the weather then make a twelve hour dash. LIke so many problems in my life right now, this may be an instance of ""wait and see.""

If I had money right now I could pay someone to take a look at it. The anti freeze levels are fine. And I checked the fuses, suspecting that the fuze powering the blower had burned out. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Perhaps the blower needs to be replaced. Or perhaps it is something even more complicated than that. Either way, my checking account is usually hovering near the nothing mark, so it's a moot point. Health insurance and rent suck up virtually all of my money right now. The rest is spent on whatever gas and groceries I can afford. I eagerly await a $700 check from Gary Fincke to arrive in my mailbox. Did I mention that I won the first place prize in ESSAY magazine a few weeks ago? Well, I did, for my literary journalism piece about the laundry fire at the Hampton. It was around the same time as the Meredith break up, so there wasn't much celebrating. Plus, what then looked like a windfall of magic cash, now seems like something I need just to scrape by and make it back home.&nbsp;

It's horrible to think that money will solve all the problems in your life, but a few hundred bucks would make my life far easier right now. Once I'm home I won't have to worry about rent anymore. And hopefully my Highmark Blue Shield coverage will kick in ASAP at the Hampton so I can ditch these outrageous COBRA payments. THEN maybe I can start working my way out of debt. 

Yesterday I drove to Greeley for my treatment. While I was there I finished reading The Grace that Keeps this World. I was extremely impressed. The crowning moment of Tom Bailey's lifes work. Impressive. Then I slept for a long time because there was nothing else to do other than watch The View. An older man was sitting next to me,&nbsp;and when he came back from the bathroom, rolling his IV pole behind him,&nbsp;he stopped in front of me and said ""Looks like we're getting the same stuff."" I was pretty out of it, but stil managed a little surprise; I'd never met anyone who recieved the same treatment as I did. ""How long have you been getting it?"" he asked. I said, ""Since I was eleven or twelve, I think. Before that I just got it in shots. But then I got older and the Gulf War sucked up&nbsp;a lot of that supply, so I started getting it this way instead.""&nbsp;""Oh,"" he said. ""I've been getting this every twenty eight days since July.""&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So.... I still haven't met anyone with my condition. He only needs it because as he got older his immune system became weaker. My immune system has always been this bad. Oh well.

At least my treatment is taken care of before I have to leave. There's also been some interest in the apartment from a few different people. I was about to start freaking about that, but after a few days on Craigs list we've had about five inquiries, including two separate people from Africa. But, frankly, those two just have too many questions and special circumstances and it seems like it would just be too complicated to transfer the apartment to either of them. But thanks anywyas Craigslist, for getting&nbsp;the word out in Africa.&nbsp;

Today I'm going to do some packing and try to get a grasp on just how much stuff I'll have to squeeze into my car. Is it possible to get some sort of small heater for my car. Would that work? I've also considered some sort of battery powered hair dryer."

"event","<p>LAST NIGHT:<br />A blonde haired kid keeps getting in and out of the pool, walking around the lobby and the halls leaving wet foot prints behind him everywhere. Other people walk by with their dirty shoes, leaving an even messier trail of mud. Consequehtly, I have to mop the floors because of this kid. He nearly redeemed himself after showing my manager his notebook which was filled with highly detailed Star Wars drawings. This was nearly enough for me to forgive him. But not enough. I hate mopping the floor.<br /><br />The kids parents aren't much better. Last night, the parents as well as another couple sat in the lobby, reading quietly for hours. I hate when people just sit in the lobby for long periods of time. It makes me feel like I'm being watched, or worse, like they might start up some asanine conversation at any time. Even though I was starving I chose not to heat up the soup I had brought with me because that would have meant walking through the lobby (past them) to the breakfast room. Inevitably they would have said somehting like ""Dinner time"" or ""Making some soup, huh?"" That would have been unbearable. Honestly, not kidding. I probably would have wanted to punch a wall.&nbsp;<br /><br />THIS MORNING<br />Mom called to see how I was doing, to ask why Meredith was leaving to school and if I knew how and when I was getting home. She told me that she had to spend a night in the hospital last week. Her blood pressure was high and she felt chest pains, nausea, all the symptoms of a heart attack. But there was no heart attack. After they gave her nitroglicerine her blood pressure fell drastically and since then she went through a series of tests and switched to a different blood pressure medicine. Everything should be fine now. She's glad I'm doing fine and is thijnking about me but doesn't want to run up minutes on my phone bill. I hung up and showered.<br /><br />A WEEK AGO:<br />Ater putting it off for&nbsp;a couple days I called home to let them know that I ended things with Meredith and I would be home as soon as possible, probably as soon as two and a half weeks. First I would have to put in my notice at the hotel, book some hotel rooms for the trip home, and figure out what would fit in my car and what would have to be mailed. Dad said it was too bad that things weren't working out, but they'd be glad to have me home. If I needed money I should let them know. They wouldn't give me money to go away, he said, but they'd give me money to come back. Then he mentioned something about Mom having to wear a heart monitor for twenty four hours and I could hear her protesting in the background, saying she didn't want me to know anything about it yet. At the time I wasn't really concerned. Neither of my parents have ever had serious health conditions. It was just kind of sad the way that my family never talks about anything.<br /><br />TODAY:<br />I read an article in the NYTimes about the field of Proximics, the study of personal space.Standing too close, talking too loud, making eye contact for too long. ""Humans tend to avert eye gaze if they feel someone is standing too close. They retreat to corners, put distance between themselves and strangers, and sit or stand equidistant from one another like birds on a wire. ... Scholars can predict which areas of an elevator are likely to fill up first and which urinal a man will choose. They know people will stare at teh lighted floor numbers in elevators, not one another."" If someone gets too close, people are likely to angle and inch their bodies away from anyone they feel breached their buffer zone. Blood pressure may rise, the heart rate may go up and the palms may sweat.&nbsp;<br /><br />TWO DAYS AGO:<br />The housekeepers were working slower than usual, so I didn't get to fold as many sheets as I usually do. I feel bad about things like that; not working to my potential. I want to be thought of as a hardworker. Since I finished early&nbsp;I was just standing around the froont desk. The assistant manager asked me if I like Red Hots. I love Red Hots! So he gave me a free bag of Red Hots! Then he said, ""If you wanna get out of here you can. I'll clock you out."" Since he was being so nice to me I returned the favor by saying ""Bad news. I quit."" My last day will most likely be between the tenth and fifteenth of December. Before I leave I will train my replacement.<br /><br />LAST NIGHT:<br />Susquehanna hosted the Essay Magazine launch. My essay, ""Castles Burning"" was announced as the winner of the Erik Kirkland Memorial Award. The essay is about&nbsp;when I worked at the Hampton Inn, when a&nbsp;there was a dryer fire. &nbsp;I wasn't at the magazine launch, though. I was in Colorado, working at the Comfort Suites, washing sheets and towels, loading them in the dryer, and folding. The prize is $700, easily the largest sum I've recieved for anything I wrote.<br /><br />A WEEK AND A DAY AGO:<br />Dr. Fincke emailed me to tell me that Dan Chaon had selected my essay as the winner of the Erki Kirkland Memorial Prize, and could I please keep it to myself for a week until the launch. I was stunned. First of all, I didn't think that alumni were even eligible for the prize. Second,&nbsp; because I thought Sal's essay was better than mine and he deserved to win.&nbsp;<br /><br />It may sound ungrateful of me to say this, but it kind of sucks that I'm always recognized for my nonfiction when I care about my fiction much more. (I'm still kind of mad that my short story didn't get into RiverCraft last year b/c the editor ""didn't get it"") Oh well. It does feel pretty amazing to win the grand prize, especially since the judge was one of my favorite authors. Dan Chaon described my essay as ""strangely poignant."" Ha. Can I use that as a blerb on my short story collection someday? Since I don't have a short story collection yet, maybe I can just put the blerb on my MySpace page or something.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having an extra $700 should help me take care of some bills. But it seems like everytime I get good news like this, something bad happens in my life.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","There's been some big news lately. Britney Spears lost her House... or something. Oh wait, no, that's not it. Now I remember. Some of the top villains of American politics are now out of power. Or, at least out of office. (I'm sure they'll weasel their way back into ""power"" in some way, still wielding their influence in America). The Democrats control the House, and will control the Senate once the Virginia recount is over with.&nbsp;Not a single Democratic incumbent lost their bid for re-election.

Two Republican Presidential hopefuls have faced huge setbacks now that they've been rejected&nbsp; by the constituents of their state. Rick Santorum was anti-gay, believed in making America a Theocracy, and believes that a woman's place is in the home, and that many women choose to work because it's ""a novelty."" George Allen, also most likely out of the Senate. He was thought of as one of the most likely to become the GOP's 2008 nominee, having been described as ""a George W. Bush clone."" Now Mr. Allen has been revealed as a racist. Not to mention the fact that, being like George W. Bush, is&nbsp;no longer considered a positive trait. (about time) And now Rumsfeld, the man who has micromanaged nearly every mistake made in the Iraq war, has resigned. It's surprising that the resignation was announced a day after the election. If it had been done a week earlier it could have been seen as a sign that Bush was truly willing to change course and the Republicans probably would have held onto a handful of seats.&nbsp;

A few weeks ago I realized why Bush and Rove were so insistent to keep Rumsfeld where he was. If Rumsfeld had resigned, then there would have had to be hearings to confirm his replacement. Such a hearing would have amounted to a hearing that would have revealed every&nbsp; mistake made in the Iraq War, and how and why each decision was made. George W. Bush truly believed that the Republicans could retain the House and Senate, he said so himself at a press conference yesterday. (side not, at the Press Conference Bush made no effort to hide just how annoyed he was by the election results. It was a sight to see) Now that the Democrats are in power, it was invetiable that there would have been hearings on Rumsfeld's performance.&nbsp;

It's a shame that this political situation was able to go on for so long. Rove is a genius, albeit an evil one. Once the GOP was in power, he knew the best way to stay in power was to have the White House, House of Representatives and Senate be in agreement on every issue. There was never any questioning of decisions being made. Anyone brave enough to put forth an opposing view was quickly villainized. Governing was little more than one continuous campaign, with every action taken with the purpose of gaining more power.&nbsp;

Now, the Christian Revolution is over. The reign of the Neocons is over. Just months ago it seemed as though the Democrats may not win another election in our lifetimes. Now there is hope.

A couple weeks ago I drove to Denver for a Barack Obama book reading. They could only guarentee that the first 350 people would be able to personally meet Senator Obama and have their books signed, so I showed up an hour early to be safe. Unfortunatlely, there were already people lined up outside at four a.m. even though the book store didn't open until seven and the Obama wasn't arriving until noon. There were probably about 100 people in front of me when they reached the 350 person limit. The crowds stuck around anyways, just to catch a glance of Obama. There was such excitement in the air. In the end, I had a chance to see Obama walk through the crowd, every bit as charismatic as he seems on TV. I then stood in the corner of the Small Business Books section listening to Senator Obama speak for five minutes about the Audacity of Hope. ""it's easy to be cynical and to believe in the worst. The hard thing is to hope for&nbsp;a world better than the one we have."" (rough quote) &nbsp;It was worth the hour drive.

Admittedly, I'm a news junkie. Everyday I read The Washington Post and New York Times online and sometimes look over USA Today as well. And now I have a subscription to the Denver Post, too. This is way too much news, and I'm trying to keep it under control. But after months of political obsessing I finally feel a payoff. Maybe now there will be withdrawal from Iraq, raise in the minimum wage, affordable health care, and fair trade instead of free trade. But I still worry. Lately I've started listening to AirAmerica, the Al Franken led liberal talk radio channel. When you're folding laundry for hours on end you start to get sick of every song on the radio and just want to hear human voices for a while. Some of the show's are thoughtful and informative. But others... are just crazy. Believe me, the far left is just as frightening as the far right.&nbsp;

Hopefully the Democrats will remember that many of their seats were won because they ran moderates, not ultra liberals. So how about a toast to moderation. Let's hope that all elected officials work together, put aside the endless campaign and work on solving problems.&nbsp;

Oh yeah, Bayh/Obama 08.

Cheers!"

"event","Karla Kelsey is coming to Denver for a poetry reading on Thursday. Richard Ford is also giving a reading in Denver that night. And CSU is hosting a reading for fiction writer Jennifer Egan. So many great events on one night, and I'll be stuck at the hotel folding sheets because they wouldn't give me the night off. This is ridiculous.However, there is one event I refuse to miss in this bastion of literary events. Tomorrow Barack Obama is signing books in Denver, and I will be one of the first 350 people in line to see a future President of the United States. There aren't many moments in one's life when you get the opportunity to meet one of your heroes. The question is, what will I say to him? Maybe just a handshake and a thank you will be enough.&nbsp; 

Escaping to Denver for part of a day will be good for me. Lately Mer and I have been staying in and taking it easy. Which has been nice, but I need to get out once and a while. The positive side of that is I've got the chance to see a lot of great movies and TV shows. Actually, just one TV show:&nbsp; LOST. Sal, Jordan, Mark, Dustin, Steph, and pretty much all of my friends have been trying to get me to watch this show for a while now. I've wanted to, and from what I'd heard I knew that I would love it, but I honestly didn't have time to invest in such an addictive show. Now I have the time, and a link to a website where I can watch every episode of Lost for free (with Chinese subtitles, as it was meant to be seen, ha). Let me say, Lost everything I ever hoped for and more. Locke is my new hero. I want to be Locke when I grow up. Also, I'm in love with Kate. 

As for movies, I sent a bunch of movie passes out to my friends: two to Catie and Mandy Hart, and four to Sal, Mark, Jordan and Ryan. I'm hoping that Catie and Mandy will not waste their tickets like my other dumb friends did when they went to see The Marine. Ugh. They could have seen a good movie like The Departed (best movie I've seen all year) or The Prestige (which looks great) or anything that's not The Marine (my friends are idiots, sometimes). Anyways, other good movies I've seen lately: First, ""Cry Baby"" a John Waters film starring a young Johnny Depp. Basically it's a spoof of the 1950s and it's incredible. I haven't laughed that loud at a movie in a long time. Even though it was so good I didn't watch it to the end because I had a date with Lost.&nbsp; Also, I've seen two great Woody Allen movies: ""Stardust Memories"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"". ""Manhattan"" is still my favorite Woody movie, but these two are both worth checking out. There was some other movie I saw where David Bowie played Andy Warhol. That was interesting I guess. Annnd, see ""The Departed"". It's fantastic, and Mark Wahlberg is hilarious. 

There were some other things I wanted to write but I forget all of them. The cable here is weird. A lot of times I'll be watching TV, turn it off, then turn it back on fifteen minutes later and I get nothing. So I just leave it on and watch static for a half hour or so until it miraculously turns on again. I don't understand."

"event","<p>First snow in Fort Collins fell today. Also, today I realized that I don't have an ice scraper. I'll need to buy one of those. And some gloves. And maybe a better coat. A scarf perhaps.&nbsp;<br /><br />An hour or so ago I drove Mer to class. The campus looks beautiful; fields of snow lit up in the dark. It makes me miss SU. CSU isn't quite as well groomed as Susquehanna, but it still looks great. The architecture is certainly a lot better. No stupid purple asterisks or ""three brown connecting circles"" sculptures. Sara, I want you to take some pics of SU when it snows there. Preferably a pic of you in front of some snowscape.&nbsp;<br /><br />Last year, Fort Collins only had about ten inches or so of snow, so I've heard from a few people that we're due for a bad winter. I told my boss that I'm hoping for a string of&nbsp; uncontrollable blizzards. I'd like to see the town descend into a state of pure chaos. My boss then pointed out a fatal flaw in my plan, asking ""What if you're stuck at the hotel?"" Touche. <br /><br />Speaking of the hotel, the whole place is decked out in Halloween parophenilia. Outside there are glowing skulls, blowup ghosts and a moving vampire figure that is really just ... unsettling. Not scary, so much as ""What is that?"" When you walk inside a ghost moves and howls at you. In the lobby there are spiders, werrewolves, witches, Halloween stickers,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's ridiculous. There's this ghost doll that sits on the front desk itself. Guests love to play with it b/c it dances and sings the ""I want candy"" song.&nbsp; I hate that ghost. Usually I take it away from the desk when I'm working.&nbsp;<br /><br />Rhonda, the housekeeping manager, is really cool. I probably talk to her more than anyone else at the hotel. We're trying to lobby the managers to expand the Halloween decorations. I'd like to see an impaled mannequin or two sitting on the couch, and gallons of fake blood splattered across the walls and floors. Maybe we could dye the pool blood red. What I'd really like to do is spray fake blood on the guests as they walk by. Also, I don't think this should be limited to Halloween. I'd like to make this an everyday sort of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Another person I talk to a lot at work Is John, the maintenance guy. He's in his sixties I guess. We talk about politcis a lot, and literary things. He's really sharp. The maintenance guy at my last hotel was really smart with politics, too. What's up with that? I wish I could fix things. He's always out in Old Town checking out restaurants and hanging out in coffee shops. He's like an old Phil (not to be confused with Old Phil from Midway, who hated me and cursed at me in Dutch while I stocked shelves). So while I fold sheets he tells me about all of the places that he's been to and the&nbsp;cool events in town that he's heard about but that I can never go to because I&nbsp;usually have to work.&nbsp;He told this great story the other day about when he was in the Navy. HIm and his buddies would be foreced to drink until they were completley sloshed. Then they would be dropped off on the curb outside of their apartments and be forced to crawl inside and up the stairs. ""There were guys layin everywhere!""<br /><br />Now I'm going to&nbsp;wash the dishes, read and watch the&nbsp;Mets Cardinals game for a bit. It sucks that the A's lost four straight games, but at least the Yankess are eliminated, too.&nbsp; Oh, and later I'll be watching Nip/Tuck. In tonight's episode, Rosie O'Donnel gets ""earjacked"". Someone slices off her ear b/c she's wearing expensive earings. Seriously, this has been the most fucked up / best&nbsp; season of Nip/Tuck yet..&nbsp; Everyone should watch this show.</p>"

"event","Are there discrimination laws about hiring smokers? In the event that I ever own a business I think it would be my policy not to hire smokers.&nbsp;

This is not a personal grudge against smokers (well, it is somewhat now that I think about it). But I don't care if people smoke. Some of my friends smoke. And that's their business. I like to smoke when I'm drunk. My prioblem is working with people who smoke.&nbsp;

The problem with people who smoke cigarettes is: they're addicted to cigarettes. Smokers need to take cigarette breaks while they're working, usually several breaks per shift. If they don't get their breaks then they become irritable, ie, bad employees. This has been a problem with at least one individual at every job I've ever worked.&nbsp;Nonsmokers can get by (usually) with only one break per shift.&nbsp;

This past weekend was Homecoming weekend at CSU, so the hotel was sold out. That means there was a lot of laundry to clean and a lot of guests to help. When I came in on Saturday afternoon, I found that a lot of the things that should have been done in the monring shift were not done (by the smoker). It was nothing huge, nothing hard to do, just things that took time. The housekeeping manager told me that he took at least three cigarette breaks. Now you consider that not only do smokers take time to go outside and actually smoke, but when they return from their break, they usually have to take a few minutes to catch their breath and recover from their break.&nbsp;

This is just bad business. Why hire somebody who is wasting your time like this? If you want into go into more about smokers costing people money, just think about how much they cost by increasing health care premiums for employers/employees. This is a touchy subject for me because of how much I have to pay for health care.&nbsp;

Think about it, and tell me if I'm wrong."

I wasn't sure if these were people who were training to become ninjas, or if these were ninjas hoping to escape from the everyday hustle and buetle of everyday ninja life. Most of my night was spent looking over my shoulder, paranoid that these ninjas were hiding behind shrubs, inside the laundry chute, etc, etc. They're a stealthy bunch, and you can never be too cautious when it comes to their brood.

"event","Right now I'm watching Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Earlier this morning, before work, Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey was on TV. Looks like my guardian angel is working extra hard today.

My car has been acting weird lately.... I think. It started a few weeks ago when I took my&nbsp; car for an Emissions test. Colorado requires everyone to pass Emissions tests, but doesn't require that your car be ""inspected."" Oh Coloardo, you're not like Pennsylvania. So anyways, all of my emissions numbers were good, but I still passed the test because my car was ""smoking up."" I didn't really understand, but the mechanic told me I could go to t he garage next door and they would change my oil and put in some sort of smoke reducing magic liquid. So I did that then waited a few weeks for my car to be healed. But in the meantime my car started feeling a lillle strange. My brakes squeeled and the steering has at times felt erratic. Plus the check engine light came on. Ugh.&nbsp;

I tend to be paranoid about my car. Sometimes I think I'll hear a noise, but it's hard to tell because a lot of the music I listen to uses a lot of squeals, grinds, and menacing hums.&nbsp;

Another problem was that I couldn't pass the emissions test with the check engine light on, because they'll fail you for that, too. But I decided that I would have it re-tested anyways, b/c maybe they would find out what was happening with my car. Of course I would never be able to figure this out by myself. I know how to check my fluids and stuff, but other than that, if I suspect something is wrong I usually end up opening the hood, looking inside and thinking ""It looks like everything is working.. ""

On the drive to Jiffy Lube my Check Engine light magically turned off, which was amazing. So I was able to pass the test. But with a catch. The mechanic (a different one this time) comes out and says ""Well you got lucky. You passed."" And he says it in this really arrogant attitude like I was trying to get away with something, or like I knew exactly what was wrong with my car but didn't want to do anything about it. I was so confused. Did he find something wrong with my car? Why would he say I got lucky? I still don't even understand what makes a car ""smoke up."" Furthermore, I did exactly what the other mechanic told me to do, and I have no idea what else I could have done had the smoke reducing elixir been ineffective. Ugh.

My dad has showed me ""car stuff"" dozens of times, but it never sinks in. That piece of my brain is apparently retarded. If this ""man"" area of my brain truly is dead, perhaps that would explain why I don't like watching football or lifting weights. But really, it's unfair that just because I'm a man I'm expected to know car things. Just like how I'm expected to know how to fix any computer problem just because I wear glasses and like Star Wars. This is a prime example of how I am a just another victim in this male dominated society. Stupid men. I hate them.&nbsp;

The check engine light has gotten into a cycle of turning on and off, on and off. Who knows what that means. Things haven't been going incredibly great at my new job. There have been many times when I've absolutely hated it and blamed it for ruining my life. And so I've considered the possibilty that maybe&nbsp; the Check Engine light isn't really telling me to look at the engine. Perhaps it's telling me to examine MYSELF. Eh? Isn't this where we truly need a check engine light: on the human heart.&nbsp;Shouldn't we be focusing less on&nbsp;the little pieces inside a car, and more on the big emotions we're feeling inside?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may want to reference the section above about me not being a real man.&nbsp; : /&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","The other night Alex alerted me to Steve Irwin's death. I told Meredith and she said ""I also heard that Kel from Keenan and Kel died."" Now, for the record, Kel is the one who was NOT Fat Albert and was NOT on SNL. So anyways, I told Alex about it, but a few seconds later Meredith said that she had heard about this on MySpace, ie, the most reliable source of news in the world, so I told Al to forget it.&nbsp;

We were able to prove that Kel is still alive by looking at IMDB and seeing that he has some new projects coming out (such as, Like Mike 2. Clearly, that movie needed a sequel).&nbsp;

Alex and I then noticed the IMDB message board on Kel's page. The first post is ""PROOF HE IS NOT DEAD... CHECK THIS OUT"", followed by ""HE IS NOT DEAD""&nbsp;,&nbsp; ""RIP KEL MITCHELL""&nbsp; ""I've got proof he's not dead""&nbsp;&nbsp; and ""Kel, please show up.""&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazing! There is some pretty pathetic/hilarious stuff on the IMDB message boards. This was easily the funniest thing I'd seen or heard all week.

The alleged ""proof"" offered by one person was ""If he died then wouldn't it be on the news?""&nbsp;&nbsp; No, you idiot. No, it would not be on the news. This is Kel Mitchell, not a real celebrity. Another post provided a link that was supposed to give proof that Kel was alive, but the link led you to a petition to get the Pepper Ann cartoon released on DVD.&nbsp;

Here are some other things that people said:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""WOW my friend at school told me he died, and I was crushed.""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I hear a rumor like once a year that he has died!""
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""I heard this rumour about 7 years ago wen I were at school. apparently they were both in a car crash and kel died and keenan was on a life support machine... weird how the rumour are still alive.""

Many of the people seemed very upset that someone would dare spread these rumors over MySpace while Kel is alive and well being a husband and father. Wow.


In other fake news, the new Nip/Tuck season premiers tonight. It promises to be the best season ever, for one reason: Mario Lopez. Saved by the Bell's Mario Lopez guest stars on the show as a gay plastic surgeon that Christian may have a fling with. Ha. I found a screen shot on MySpace that shows Dr. Troy and A.C. Slater together in a public shower. WHAAAT? Craziest show ever. But then again, i did see this news on MySpace so I suppose I shouldn't be believing any of this."

Okay, so before I left home I prepared one of the greatest mix CDs OF ALL TIME! Well... I really liked it. Oh, how excited I was to have such an amazing CD to listen to on my twenty five hour drive to Colorado. ..... Unfortunately, I forgot to burn myself a copy before I left. BUT I did burn copies for Catie, Dustin and Josh. Other friends will be receiving their copies soon and they'll be all like ""Awesome."" Here's the playlist (because livejournal has been all about playlists lately)

1. Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) - The Arcade Fire
2. Jesus, Etc. - Wilco
3. Launch Ramp - Ben Kweller
4. Hold Me Now - Polyphonic Spree
5. Veronica - Elvis Costello
6. Talk to Jesus - The Brunettes
7. Let's Dance - David Bowie
8. My Doorbell - The White Stripes
9. I'll Come Running - Brian Eno
10. The Sporting Life - The Decemberists
11. Fell Down the Stairs - Tilly and the Wall
12. In the Aeroplane Over the Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel
13. Take Me Out - Franz Ferdinand
14. Nothing But Flowers - Talking Heads
15. Could Be the Moon - Cub Country

17. We Will Become Silhouettes (cover) - The Shins
18. The Good Life - Weezer
19. The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders - Sufjan Stevens
20. Just Like Heaven - The Cure

Some notes.&nbsp;
That Arcade Fire song is one of my favorite songs of all time.
I tried out a few different Elvis Costello songs, like ""The Beat"" or ""This Year's Girl"" but ""Veronica"" worked best. Every good mix cd should have an Elvis Costello song, a wise man once said.
The Brunettes are so cute.
My brother called me last night to get this playlist from me, and he was like ""What's up with that ""Let's Dance"" song? It's so random. Who is that?""&nbsp;&nbsp; !!!&nbsp; He didn't know Let's Dance by David Bowie? COME ON!
And as for the rest of the songs... they're all great. The end.


On another note, on Tuesday Comcast came to the apartment to&nbsp; install our cable internet, and by install I mean, they hooked up the cable then handed me an ""internet self installation kit."" It took a good three hours to get online. Sigh. But having TV again is great considering that I went abotu two weeks with no TV other than seeing bits of the news in hotel lobbies, and the one night when we watched Pee Wee's Playhouse in the Ripas hotel room. Mer and I now have access to 300 channels including HBO and a bunch of other movie channels. So what's the first thing that I watched? The Indian In the Cupboard movie. Awesome. I loved those books. There were four or five of them and I read them all. Thinking about them made me wantt to re read them. Oh man.&nbsp; But I ended up kind of overdosing on TV that day. I watched it pretty much nonstop. That day I watched Entourage, followed by PCU (Jeremy Piven mini marathon). I also saw the last two parts of Spike Lee's ""When the Levees Broke"" documentary. Everything else is a blur. Tonight there was some sort of Office marathon. I really want to get that on DVD. And now, Taxi Cab Confessions. Hahahahahaaha."

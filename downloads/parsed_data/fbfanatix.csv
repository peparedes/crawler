"event","wow.... i met one of my old friends ,Ian, from camp online (actually, he goes to kilmer, but i didnt think he was the same person). we were talking and then he tells me to IM this 8th grader. so i did, and he asked if i was a comet, and i said yes. then he went on a rant that comets are no-good-dirty cheaters. that ticked me off.





then he asked if i was Ian's girlfriend.


i swear, i felt like i was gonna puke.

"event","*yawns* I'm so sleepy. And cold. *shivers* 

I'm mortified by my dad. I was telling my cuzin about how britney spears is pregnant, wen my dad suddenly interrupted.

""Who's Britney Spears?""

I suddenly went into a super long rant about how he must've lost his memory. he's never heard of britney spears, justin timberlake, usher, micheal jackson, and all these other people. Then I asked him to just name one American song.

instead, he burst out singing ""Que sera, sera."" 

i hate that song so much. he used to play that song 20 times in a row, just because he thought it was about a person named Sarah. 

he needs help.....

then my cuzin and i started talking about 80's music, like The Who, Pink Floyd, and Queen. then she was gonna send me some songs through the e-mail, but i never got them

and now i just found out why

she attached the songs to the e-mail.....

...but never sent the e-mail....

i have the weirdest family, but then again, i'm weird myself





guess it runs in the family"

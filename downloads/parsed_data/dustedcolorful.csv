"event","*sigh* So I moved in with Lunette..yesterday? I lost track of days now. It's like...I don't really care about anything at all. Except I do care about getting away from it all. I want to see Phoenix, but at the same time I don't. I'd be too ashamed to face him. 

Lunette took me on a shopping spree. More like forced, but whatever. I got some pretty strange clothes. It's not that bad...it's just not ME, you know? But I wear it to make her happy. That's all that matters in this whole thing, right? If I play along, she'll most likely get sick of it. At least, that's all I can hope for.

I was a little surprised when Phoenix hugged and kissed me...and even Lunette. The look on her face was priceless. But of course, I couldn't laugh or smile. I can tell she'll be planning Phoenix's destruction soon. I should try to put a stop to it...when the time is right? Or..when she lets her guard down.

Sadly..this afternoon Lunette made me write a note to Phoenix saying that I wanted to 'break up'. She actually wanted me to do it earlier. I lied, saying that I have. Lunette didn't trust me. She said that Phoenix was too happy for his own good. So I had to write Phoenix saying that I wanted to end all connections with him. That it was fun while it lasted. I'm sure he trusts me enough to know how I really feel. I hope. It seems all I can do these days is hope.

I feel horrible for making Jaysin and Phoenix worry..but it's not really in my power to control anything at all. I miss the days where my biggest worry was what time Nathaniel was going to come by to pick up Jaysin. Damn.

But she keeps me up all night, telling me her plans and forcing me to kiss her. Luckily, the worst thing she has done was taking off my shirt. Other than that, it hasn't gone too far. I wonder how far she will go...only God knows.

"event","So I guess Phoenix and Jaysin have noticed I've been acting strange. I knew it wouldn't take them very long to realize, but not this soon. While I was out buying a pack of cigarettes from the liquor store, I found the note Phoenix left for me in my wallet. I stood there reading it, forgetting that there was a guy waiting for my money..forgetting that there was a whole line of angry people waiting for me to hurry up. After a few of them shouted, I snapped out of my daze and shoved the note in my pocket. 

After leaving the store, I didn't know what to do anymore...besides open the pack of cigs and start on them, of course. I walked to the park and sat on the bench, thinking of what I should do. I finally figured it out. As much as I'd love to tell Phoenix what is happening, I can't. I know Lunette has something up her sleeve and frankly, I know she'll do anything she can to hurt Phoenix..Jaysin..or even that bum. I should write Phoenix back, but I can't. Everytime I try, nothing comes out. I can't put into words how I feel.

So I'm going to run away for a few days. Lunette said it was fine...I wanted her to know I wasn't skipping town. I just want to clear my head for a while. Think things through. Because damn. Since when has my life ever been complicated? I'm not used to this sort of shit. 

I've already packed a few bags in my car..and I called Jaysin to tell him about my 'little trip'. I actually wanted to just leave a message..I didn't want Jaysin to hear how pathetic I was. But I suppose it's better to hear it in person, right? He sounded a little sad, but then...almost as if he encouraged it. That made me a bit happier. I think he knows that is going on. I can't hide anything from someone I've known my whole life.

Fuck. I can't even enjoy a peaceful smoke because some asshole is here mowing the park grass! I think I'm more irritated than usual. I think I'll make one last stop before I head off on my 'vacation'. Nathaniel's house. I'm going to tell him to watch Jaysin for me while I'm gone. But if he does anything bad...I will kill him. TWICE.

Peace-

As if I didn't already have a horrible feeling of just kissing her..but to be blackmailed too? At first, I was thankful that I was allowed to date Phoenix now that school is over, but it seems everybody likes to screw me over! Man...So here's the story. 

I met Lunette at the coffee shop, as planned. But instead of wearing her carefree smile, her expression changed instantly to that of a smirk. It was frightening, actually. To think someone like her could actually be like this. I guess I was lucky to have previous girlfriends that weren't psychotic..[well, Villa was..in another way..*mumbles something about a dress*]

*sigh* She said that if I don't quietly break up with Phoenix, then she will send the pictures to the headmaster of our college and have me fired and Phoenix kicked out. I don't want that for me..but I definately don't want that for Phoenix..who has his whole life ahead of him. 

I want to tell Phoenix so bad, but I know that she wouldn't just let me go without doing something sneaky first...wiretapping or whatever! Because she most likely knows that Phoenix is staying at my place for the summer...so I could just tell him at home, but she told me that she has everything covered. And I believe her. I know she is capable of this shit...that's what makes me even more angry!

While I listened the whole time, I dug my fingernails into my jeans...trying my best to keep calm. I didn't have to sit by and listen to her PLANNING our 'relationship'! But having a tantrum would put me in even deeper shit. But Lunette dared to say that if I didn't go through with this, not only will Phoenix and I be hurt, but she'll find a way to break Jaysin and Nathaniel up. Okay, Nathaniel is an evil person, but I don't want Jaysin to be sad. Because I know that without Nathaniel, Jaysin will fall into a slump...and never get back up. I don't see what this has to do with my brother...or Phoenix! I feel bad for getting everyone involved in this..

Near the end, she asked me to kiss her. I refused, but she said it was part of the deal...so I did. I...had to do it three times since she claimed 'there wasn't enough feel in it'. But right afterward I backed out of my chair, knocking it over, and drove home. I still can't let it go. Is this really happening? Is she watching us in our own home? dammit..

I'm sorry, Phoenix, but I started smoking again...but that's just the least of our problems. Maybe I'll take a short vacation. Alone.

"event","I'm glad Phoenix had fun at the fair with Jaysin and Nathaniel. I was a little worried at first...thinking that maybe Nathaniel would spend too much time with Jaysin and not enough with MY Phoenix. But I knew that Jaysin wouldn't let that sort of thing happen. I'm glad.

But lately, our house has been smelling of muffins~ It makes me want to drool...but I think Phoenix has already seen me drool enough...yeah. So instead, I will just sniff to my heart's content~ [that sounds kind of bad, doesn't it?] But oh well! Even if we don't have any more muffins..it still smells damn good! I wake up to the heavenly smell of muffins..and breakfast! 

It seems...weird. I don't know what to do anymore. I mean..I do know! I should continue to be happy knowing that Phoenix is by my side! But...after the school meeting, Lunette just surprised me. Every time I think about it, I get shivers and just want to curl up on my bed and...sit there. I have what I want..why do I feel so strange? Is it because I know everything can go wrong now? 

I suppose I've been very vague so far. So I'll explain. After the meeting, Lunette dragged me aside and asked me if I wanted to have dinner at her house. I figured it was harmless, so I humbly accepted. We arrived and had a lovely dinner..well, it was a normal dinner...nothing compared to what Phoenix cooks, of course. But afterward, I was about to leave when Lunette ran between me and the door. 

That was when I knew something was wrong. It was strange. Like something in a movie. So, she told me that ever since she saw me...she has liked me. We haven't even known each other for that long! But she said it wasn't fair that I was already taken..by a guy, even. I couldn't do anything but stand there and watch her just...break down. As pathetic as I am, I tried to relax her by putting a hand on her head and saying some words of comfort..but it seems that was her plan all along. 

So she pulled on my tie and stole a kiss from me. I backed away, quite angry..but I couldn't hit her. Even if she's sneaky...that doesn't change the fact that she's a lady. So I gently pushed her aside and made for my car. As I put the key in, she shouted from the doorway, 'I'll be looking forward to student teaching for you'. 

Right now, I feel that I can't even look Phoenix in the eye. But I do my best to act normal. Of course, Jaysin and Phoenix are smarter than that. They probably already know something is wrong with me. But I can't say! It's too embarassing and...well, shameful. But dammit! I don't want to leave Phoenix out of everything! And...it wasn't entirely my fault anyway! *sigh* I just want to disappear right now.

Dusty"

"event","Ahh~ Today was rather...energizing. I met with Lunette and had lunch with her. We talked about some of the meetings that we'd both have to attend later this month and then chowed down on some hamburgers..well, I had more ice cream than burgers...but whatever works.

Well, she came over to my house since I wasn't meeting Phoenix until later that night. But when I had left to go to the bathroom, Jaysin told her that I was going out with Phoenix! It wasn't until after I punched Jaysin in the shoulder that I realized I didn't really need to hide that secret anymore. ...I forgot to apologize to Jaysin for needless punching. Oh well, I'm sure he'll forgive me...

*sigh* But yesterday Jaysin asked me if he could get a second job. I was a little hesitant at first, until he explained to me WHY he wanted a second job. It was true that without a father and with mother not really...working a full-time job...that I couldn't really handle ALL the payments. Which is somewhat true, but we're doing fine, as Jaysin can see. I'd feel bad to see Jaysin working his ass off, but he seemed determined. After sighing a few more times, I told him he could do whatever he wanted. But that didn't seem like the answer he wanted. What did he WANT me to say? That I'd LOVE for him to do it? I'm already worried about him working at a club, for god's sake! Maybe I'm thinking too much. But he's working with NATHANIEL. How much good could that be?

He also asked if Phoenix and I wanted to go to the fair. I was excited to go, but remembered that was the date I had to go to that meeting with Lunette. I said that he could call Phoenix up and ask him if he was free! At least he could have some fun while I'm in some damn meeting~

Anyway. I just took a shower and I'm in the process of getting ready to go to Phoenix's house. I thought maybe we could have some fun by ourselves. Selfish? NEVER! But now, whenever I take a shower, I get a little nervous that Phoenix is going to slip in again. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe instead of waiting for Phoenix to talk to me about taking our relationship a bit farther, perhaps I will be more...aggressive? I shall try. I hope Phoenix doesn't...freak out again. I don't know what I'd do then...

"event","Uwah~ It's nice to have the internet again. School might not be in session, but I still mourned over its loss. But I have Phoenix now~ So all is well in the Echarpe residence. 

Lately, I haven't done much...that is part of my job, anyway. I've mostly been out with Phoenix taking walks, watching movies or just having some fun. It is so nice to just be able to walk around town, holding hands and actually EXPRESSING our relationship. Before, it was almost like lying to the world...but now, it's much different. 

I'm glad that Jaysin doesn't mind either. I hear them giggling all the time. But each time, I just HAVE to peak. You know, it's kind of like that..reaction...thing? Shut up. I'm NOT weird and I know it. That Nathaniel-kid is weird. What does Jaysin see in that bum anyway? UGH! I'm not ruining my day by thinking of him.

Phoenix is cooking something right now. It smells really good. But we..er..I just got out of the shower. AH! My heart is going crazy now. Everytime I think about it, I just can't..calm down? Even now, I can feel myself blushing. But Phoenix joined me in my shower today. Luckily, [or maybe unluckily] he was clothed so I didn't..do anything bad or anything. But I was a little embarassed..seeing as how I don't shower with clothes on...I ugh..damn. I'd like to say that I enjoyed showering with Phoenix, but seeing as how..nevermind. 

I just can't take this abuse! Is Phoenix trying to torture me on purpose? Or maybe he wants to take our relationship farther? Or BOTH? It makes me wonder..should I talk to him about it...or just pounce? But from experience, I should know by now that Phoenix isn't too fond of me just...doing things on my own. [*cough new years*] Now I'm confused...

"event","Ugh, life has been so busy even though college has been let out. But luckily, I've had more time to go and visit Phoenix! Although it makes me wonder if I should back up a little. When I lost my father, I didn't want people to talk to me, not even Jaysin. I wanted to be alone..so does Phoenix? Hmm. Phoenix seems to be fine though...but still. You don't just get over stuff like that in a week. I should go visit him soon! Very soon...

I'm excited that we're finally able to be open with the relationship. I still think we should wait though. For some reason, I have a bad feeling if we were seen so soon. I mean, I don't mind, but I'd feel bad for poor Phoenix. But sadly, Phoenix isn't taking any history classes during his junior year. I'm a little sad, yet not. Because if he were to be my student again, then we'd have that whole student/teacher scandal going on. 

I think Jaysin might need a tutor for his last three weeks of high school. He has a major case of senioritis and is struggling in one of his classes. Jaysin used to be good at math...until second semester this year. I bet it's all that Nathaniel's fault...distracting Jaysin on purpose! He wants Jaysin to fail!

But Jaysin was pretty excited this morning. He said something about getting the prom pictures today. I wonder how they turned out. Nathaniel better have been smiling or I'll beat that punk's face in. Young brats these days...

And uh..oh yeah. I had a meeting with Lunette a week ago or so. I informed her of the school's meetings and how she has to get prepared for the upcoming school year, even though it may seem far away..it'll be coming up soon. She seemed pretty hyped up. Ahh to be young again. Wait..I'm not that old either! Psh! I'm young enough to kick Nathaniel's ass! 

But anyway! Lunette will still be student teaching with me for the fall semester [considering she only had one day of real teaching..] So I'm looking forward to it. Hopefully I don't have to teach sophomores because I don't want Nathaniel in my class...yet AGAIN. [I had to pass him, dammit.] 

Anyway, I'm beat. I still have stacks of papers to do. [It's 'summer' and I'm sitting here working! What's with this world?] Maybe I'll go make my day better by giving Phoenix a little visit. I think I will! Shit. I hope it isn't too late to ask if he wants to stay at my house... I should go ask now!

"event","So...lots of things happened. I found out Phoenix's father passed away. It hurts to see him in so much pain after finally finding out about his loss. And after a year too! That's just too long to not know that your father isn't here anymore. How could nobody tell him? That's just wrong! Wrong, I say! 

At first, I wondered why Phoenix would be getting all those boxes. I was a little suspicious that it was that photo perv sending Phoenix...random shit. But I guess it wasn't. I was relieved, but then at the same time, I wasn't. I called up Jaysin [who was at Nathaniel's house] and Jaysin called up Rekhat...and they all helped the two of us move the boxes into the house. When the three left, I made Phoenix some hot chocolate. It looked like Phoenix needed something to warm him up. I've never really seen him that cold before. It tears me apart. 

I was shocked when Phoenix told me the news [well...in a way it's news...it turned out to be quite old]. I was never really one for comforting people, so hopefully I didn't seem heartless. The only thing I could really do was whisper to him, giving him kisses here and there to show him, prove to him that someone would always be there for him. 

I've tried to take him out a few times...only when he seems, well, more relaxed. After all, I know how he feels. I felt the same way after my father died. Everyone in the family was silent for..god knows how long. Weeks? Well, Jaysin didn't seem to care. I think father was the one person Jaysin hated. But now that I think about it..I still have mother and Jaysin. Phoenix has no family left. Dammit! I feel so helpless! I just hope that being by him will get him through this troubling stage. 

I think during the summer, I should ask Phoenix if he wants to stay over at my place. I overheard Nathaniel talking to Jaysin about sharing the apartment [and marriage stuff..they're joking though, right?]. Because..I noticed when Phoenix isn't right by my side, I get nervous and find myself going in the backyard smoking. I know it's bad, but I get nervous about Phoenix. Kind of like..'I wonder how he's doing...' stuff like that. I really hope he's okay. AH shit. I need to go outside now. I hope it's summer soon.

"event","Finally! I get time to myself. Well, I have had time to myself, it's just that right now is when I've been...well..alone? Usually my time to myself = Phoenix time. Mwaha. [you didn't hear that.] 

Anyway. I went to Phoenix's 'Hamlet' play. I'd have to admit..I never really liked Hamlet, but just thinking of Phoenix in a yummy dress makes me all hyped up. [Phoenix was sooo much better than that girl in the movie we saw in class...] But he's such a good actor! I'm sure that he'll be big soon! Very soon. But Phoenix died..in the play! How could they?! UGH! It was too sad to watch. I felt like getting up and leaving and just being like..drama queen-ish, but I thought that it would have been too immature. [and Nathaniel would think I'm a pansy.] Plus..it's not like Phoenix ACTUALLY died...I don't even want to think about it..

Happy thoughts now! Uhm...I got a back massage from Phoenix! When he mentioned it..I couldn't help but be all flustered. Ahh! I'm so weird! Inside I was just 'DO IT! SAY YES!' but I couldn't quite say that. Haha. But man, did it feel strange lying in Nathaniel's bed. [okay..that sounded REALLY weird.] But eventually I got over it once I got some Phoenix love~ [only through kisses. Damn. I swear..soon..very soon. *evil grin*] I can't believe I fell asleep though! wtf was I thinking?! I didn't even get to enjoy my Phoenix time. I hope he didn't get a wrong impression or anything. I guess I was just relaxed. I haven't been that relaxed since..god knows how long.

Ahh~ If only I could live in that dream world forever! 

Hmm...so recently...nothing has really happened. Oh. I think Phoenix left Muffin here or something...maybe not. Sometimes I could have sworn I saw him in the corner of my eye. But when I look, there's nothing! Crepe is randomly showing up in places. It's a little spooky. Maybe Jaysin's playing tricks on me?

Speaking of Jaysin, I heard he and Nathaniel are going to prom. Did he go to Nathaniel's prom? Not that it really matters..oh well. Reminds me of my prom days. Ahhh memories. Although in this case, they're not exactly good ones. Well, in a way I suppose they are. Except Villa and I aren't together anymore. At least we're still friends. [damn that Nate...he's so mean to me~ *sob*]

But geez. Rekhat seems to be raiding our house recently! Every time I come home he seems to be there. It's rather...interesting. Jaysin insists that they're just studying for their exams coming up...since Rekhat needed the help. [actually..they both do, but I'll just say Rekhat needs it the most.] It's a routine...walk in the door, toss keys onto the side table, take off shoes, undo tie, and get a loud and obnoxious greeting from Rekhat. Someday that kid is going to think I'm his brother or something..

Well, time to go grade some quizzes. Let's just see how Nathaniel did and alter his grade a bit. [of course, I wouldn't do that..*cough*]

But a few days ago it was Phoenix's 21st birthday! And, as the customary 21st birthday, we just HAD to go drinking. Maybe Jaysin and Nathaniel weren't old enough...but oh well. They had soda or something. I don't really remember. But I know it was lots of fun~ For me anyway. I'm sure Phoenix had tons of fun having his first drink~ Haha we shared the pink squirrel and damn was it good. Especially after Phoenix drank from it~ It just made the whole experience that much better.

Although..it's kind of weird. When Phoenix brought Muffin over...it must just all be in my head. I hope. I'm not insane, right? Crepe and Muffin are both stuffed dolls. They can't move..let alone FIGHT each other. Hm. Perhaps I was dreaming. Or I drank too much. That's always a possibility.

Something else that was odd was a few days ago...Nathaniel called me to come pick up Phoenix. I did so, but Phoenix's hair was..long again? I was really confused. Maybe Phoenix has some sort of magic shampoo or something. Rather odd, I'd have to say. I bet it was all Nathaniel's fault..some sort of witchcraft. AHA! He must've enchanted Jaysin into liking him too! I'm onto that guy...*mumbles*

*sigh* I'm so tired of teaching. Stupid exams and stuff. Perhaps I can take Phoenix out into the country sometime. That'd be nice. Maybe this weekend? Unless he has a lot of exams. I think Jaysin has spring break next week so...Phoenix can ditch! YEA! Oh wait..he'd be against it. DAMN. I need to rethink a plan...hm...I can always run it by him. I'll just see what he says. [Although I already know it's a 'no.'] Fate is against me.

"event","Ahh it's been a while since Phoenix has came over. But the last time he did, we had such a fun sleepover~ I brought out Crepe, the octopus that Phoenix gave me [<3], before Phoenix came over. I was hoping that maybe Crepe and Muffin could have bonding time...just as I was having bonding time. Although not as much bonding time as I WANTED...But it's all good.

We watched some movies~ Although I couldn't really pay attention to them. My eyes kind of..wandered I guess you could say. Darn my stupid eyes! Sadly, I can't put the blame on anything else. [Maybe Nathaniel..somehow?]

But man. I've been sick for almost two weeks! This sucks..a lot. At home, I think I passed out a few times. Luckily one time Jaysin caught me and another time...well I didn't hit anything on my way down...except the floor. But I'm okay! I think. Jaysin's been taking good care of me. I feel a little bad. I haven't called Phoenix for a while. Maybe he thinks I'm dead! Nooo! 

Well. He saw me four days ago so I can't be...THAT dead, can I? I might skip out tomorrow too if this continues. My head kind of hurts right now..but who knows. Maybe some miraculous event will cure me! I'd so love that. Maybe I'll call Phoenix now? 

Then again...I don't know. I probably sound like crap. I haven't really said more than two sentences at a time, let alone a whole conversation. Maybe I'll wait. NO! I can't! I must call right now, whether I sound old man-ish or not!

I oughta send him back! MWAHAA! He deserves it. But I was out walking with Jaysin one time and I saw him...crippled and everything. I pushed Jaysin into a nearby crowd so he wasn't seen with me...[yea he didn't enjoy that too much..but I was protecting him~] But I wanted to point and laugh at that guy..but he would've noticed me. Darn. But if he goes after Phoenix or Jaysin..oh man. I'd punch his face in so hard, the police wouldn't be able to identify him. He'd be the blob man.

But at school it's been a drag. I've been so tired lately. Damn. Haha I guess you could say I'm so tired, I can't even smoke! And smoking is supposed to relax me. I'm afraid if I start to smoke in the backyard, I'll fall asleep and catch the flowers on fire. At least it'd be pretty?

It was fun to dance with Phoenix at Jaysin's party. Especially all dressed up~ Maybe we should do it again. But instead dress down. Shit! Why am I thinking like that?! I bet that's how that Nathaniel thinks! UGH! His perverted mind is rubbing off on me...damn that kid. Now I can't stop thinking about it! I should be shot.

I have an idea. Since Jaysin can do what he wants now..I guess...I'm kicking him out of the house and inviting Phoenix over. I'd hate to leave Jaysin in Nathaniel's hands, but I'd like a sleepover with Phoenix once. I mean, I'm not going to...<i>do</i> anything to Phoenix, of course, but I mean it'd be nice. Alone time? Haha. Usually we're either out in the public or at home with the gang. Tomorrow..MWAHAHA. My plan will work. I mean, Jaysin won't complain! 

Lately I realized something. While staring at Phoenix..I mean grading papers in class while sometimes looking up at Phoenix..*cough* I noticed that his hair length..changes? Maybe it's just me but some days it looks shorter than others. I know it's impossible..but..it's strange. Maybe I should have my eyes..no, my head checked. Just a thought.

Jaysin has been riding his Vespa lately. He's not...really supposed to, but I guess it's safe. He's so weird though! Jaysin bought this scarf just so he could wear it on his little Vespa and have it blow in the wind? Weird! And I'm related to him..haha. But it's nice because I send him on grocery store errands...[even though he doesn't come home till two hours later.] I send him to buy TWO things! The store is only at MOST ten minutes away. WALKING. So fifteen minutes maximum to go there, buy it, and come back..I think he goes to visit Nathaniel. That punk is a bad influence on Jaysin. Damn you, Nathaniel..damn you.

"event","Wow. Just..wow. Jaysin's birthday party was NOT what I expected it to be. After all...I thought most of it was..under control I guess you could say. What I mean by that was..that I thought I knew what was going to go on, considering I planned most of it with Phoenix. But NO. You know what? It was just weird! And funny. But mostly humiliating. 

Most of the night went fine and dandy until after dinner. Makes me wonder if someone slipped something in the food. Jaysin and Phoenix snuck away, leaving Rekhat, Tarrant, Nathaniel and myself in the kitchen. We sat there..small talk and stuff. Rekhat was showing my some of the pictures on his camera...mostly his band pictures. I always thought those were interesting. Hopefully they find another member soon. I'd want to see them play. 

That was until I saw Phoenix and Jaysin walk back into the room. Phoenix was wearing a lavender and nurse outfit [topped off with a white nurse hat] while Jaysin was wearing one of those maid outfits. With..frily edges?! UGH! I was about to go pounce on Jaysin and tell him to change at once but Nathaniel beat me to him. So instead I stared at...well shut up. So I can't control my eyes..that's not MY fault is it? I didn't think so.

See, if that was all..maybe the party wouldn't have gotten to be so..ahhh. But it scared me when I saw them holding bags. There were only two though..so I guess I was a bit relieved. That was until Phoenix handed both Nathaniel and me a bag. They said we had to 'share' it. Jaysin laughed and pointed us to my room to change? So I went in first..with both bags though. Nathaniel told me to go first? What a wuss.

What lay in front of me was...indescribable. It was outfits! But not just ordinary outfits...costumes! Geez. If Jaysin told me we were going to do this...I would have kicked him out and told him to spend the rest of the night with Nathaniel. But damn. I chose the most...manly...I guess. I had the miko/priestess outfit. But the shoulder area was supposed to hang off so it felt a little..odd being revealing. 

So I walk outside and I figured out that damn Nathaniel wasn't GOING to do this! ARGH! So why did I?! Geez, now I lost all my dignity. Oh well, I'll just tell everyone it was to fulfill my brother's wish? That stupid boyfriend of him is just too chicken to do it. Some lover, huh? [I'm so breaking Nathaniel's camera when I get my hands on it.]

But I guess it wasn't too bad. I got some Phoenix-time afterward when Jaysin, Nathaniel, Rekhat and Tarrant left. So that's good. <3

"event","I don't know if it's just me...or Phoenix seems a little more flirty. Haha. Not a whole lot, but I can tell. See, teachers notice these things. Maybe..or I'm just looking at him more closely? Either way, maybe it's a good thing. Or I'm just being a total loser and 'imagining' it all. That'd suck. I might become another photo perv. Boo! Are my eyes supposed to be on Phoenix's ass when he walks? GOD. I think I AM turning out to be weird! Hopefully it's just natural...Right? Is my face supposed to feel really hot right now?

But Phoenix came over with Hamlet tickets~ I think he said he was going to be Ophelia. In high school, it didn't interest me all too much..then again english wasn't my class. But if Phoenix is in it, then I'm SURE I'll be glued to the play. [or glued on Phoenix.] Damn, I can't wait. I can't wait a couple more weeks! Then again...I see Phoenix everyday so..I guess I'm not too Phoenix-deprived, am I? Haha. 

Sadly, Phoenix left about an hour ago. But he helped us [more like Jaysin] make dinner. While in my room making a study sheet, I heard laughing. I swear, if Nathaniel had come over, I would have beat that guy so hard it wouldn't be funny. But it was only Phoenix and Jaysin..tickling each other? I couldn't help but blush at the sight since they looked like they were having fun. It was too cute to pass up. Hopefully they didn't see me. That probably wouldn't look so good to be a stalker. Oh god! Another symptom!

Earlier while watching the television, Phoenix was asking about Jaysin's birthday. I think Nathaniel wanted Jaysin the whole day, that selfish bum.. Phoenix looked like he wanted to do something together though...maybe I should take back what I said to Nathaniel..after all. We want to have some birthday fun with Jaysin, too! GR! Maybe that lazy bum will share. I don't think he's that mean.

I told Phoenix that maybe one day he could help me decorate my room. After all, I only have a bed, dresser and a desk in my room. That's about it. Not very interesting at all.

I went grocery shopping for mother today. While at the store, I saw some kids from my class. It was a little awkward. Jaysin was pulling some stuff from the shelves while I was riding along on the cart. I felt childish after being caught. I guess I was so used to doing it, I never really noticed. Oh well. Luckily they were girls and not guys. The guys would've blackmailed me or something. That just means they could have joined photo boy. 

I bought myself a pack of that non-smoking gum. But..I also bought myself a pack of cigarettes..so I don't know how that works. The cashier lady gave me a confused look and all I could do was smile. Unfortunately the girls passed by when I was checking out so now they know I smoke. GREAT! More people to know. Geez. Oh well. At least I'm buying myself the gum rather than having poor Phoenix buy it FOR me. I'm taking matters into my own hands now!

"event","So today...is Sunday. Yay. I think..I'm so confused. Well, it's kind of pathetic. I'm just confused about whether I should eat right now..or sleep. I'm hungry yet really tired. Wow...decisions these days, huh?

Well, anyway. Earlier Nathaniel came over. I told him Jaysin wasn't here, but he wasn't here for that. Then I shouted 'NO YOU CAN'T HAVE HIS HAND IN MARRIAGE.' But he wasn't here for that either. So I was out of ideas. Damn. I thought I figured that guy out too. Oh well. He asked if I wanted Jaysin back for dinner on his birthday. I gave it a good couple minutes of thought...then I said it was okay if he didn't...being the nice guy I am. SEE?! I'm not so bad...I could've just said..no to him going out at all..but I didn't. 

Just don't touch him, Nathaniel. If you do, I rip your fingers off. 

But today has been a good day so far. Full of nothing really. Yesterday I went to a hockey game. It was pretty fun. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought. Jaysin said that he got the tickets from Rekhat...because Rekhat apparently couldn't go...and Jaysin was busy with work. So I went. Yep! 

I got Jaysin a gift though for his birthday. It's a 'stay five feet away' sticker to keep on him when he's around Nathaniel. Okay, maybe I didn't get him that..but it'd be nice. Jaysin was all hyped up about Nathaniel and his motorcycle...so I got him this Vespa. It's like..light purple. I don't know if he'll like it or not. He needs to get his license first. He got his permit...a while ago I think. He needs to practice though! Hm..I don't know if he needs a special license..oh well. I guess he'll have to research! More studying! Hahaha. I'm a mean brother, aren't I?

Tomorrow is a day off. Therefore I'll ask Phoenix if he wants to go somewhere. We'll probably leave town...since it'll be a lot better though. When does that asshole photographer get out of the hosptial anyway? I'm itching for him to get out so I can send him back there.

"event","Wow..today was spectacular. I'll talk about school first..then my date~ Well, I dropped by the nurses' office and gave a yellow rose to Jule. [I like yellow roses even if they AREN'T romantic as red ones...] And I asked her to give Villa the pink one for me...since I wouldn't be available later in the day to go deliver it myself. And Nate? I gave him an evil glare. Well..kind of. It's our way of saying 'hello', minus the polite part. Lots of kids looked happy today. So you know what? Being the nice guy I am, I let them do whatever. It's a day for love~ And I expressed my love for free time by giving it to them, therefore giving ME a break too. Damn. I'm selfish. But Nathaniel..that's a different story. I made sure he wasn't taking Jaysin anywhere where he would corrupt him. Otherwise I'd murder him. On Valentine's! How sad. Moving on..

I picked up Phoenix today..but not in my run-down car..but in a limo! I figured we'd walk home since it was so pretty outside~ Therefore, it was a one-way ticket to the Italian restaurant. I've been there only once before and I liked it...so I took Phoenix there~ But they're really strict. Boo. But Phoenix and I snuck sharing bites of food. Sure, we got some strange looks, but what the hell, they're on a date too. You don't see me gawking at them do you? I didn't think so.

I felt a little bad drinking wine in front of Phoenix though. You can only truly enjoy it when the other person is drinking it also. So I only took a few sips. Plus after drinking..well..less formal alcohol...drinking wine all of a sudden felt funny. So I stuck with ice water. The food was reallly good. Although I'd choose Phoenix's cooking over that anyday. But man, that spumoni was good. I tried to feed Phoenix a few spoonfuls of the spumoni like they do in the movies..but it probably wasn't ANYTHING like it...darn. Oh well, someday I'll master it!

Our walk home was pretty romantic I guess you could say. It was almost like a dramatic soap opera when the wind came. It was practically planned. At least it seemed so. I tried to shield Phoenix from the cold wind, using well...myself, but I don't know if I did much. But it was the perfect time to give him the first half of my gift. [the second part I had Jaysin sneak in during our date.] He seemed quite surprised. Then he turned that all around and surprised ME with a kiss. Wow. It all went well~ 

Unfortunately we had to go back to Phoenix's dorm. I mean I don't mind, but we didn't do much in the snow like I thought. [although dancing in it was pretty damn fun if you ask me.] I hope Phoenix liked the second half...he seemed to like it. He started to cry, and I began to think I did something wrong...but then he pushed me into the door and kissed me. He took my job! Haha. But I got shoved into the bathroom...only to come out and see Phoenix in his bed with a stuffed octopus, an adorable heart pillow and a box of chocolates. At first...I thought Phoenix wasn't wearing any shorts. Bad me, yes I know. But my hopes were crushed when I later saw him wearing shorts underneath. Drats. Oh well...

But I can't believe Phoenix is such a sewing genius! Man...it makes me happy to know he sewed something [two things] especially for me~ I have to think up a name for the octopus though~ Something to remember US by. And that heart pillow is so going on my bed. For forever. And ever. And after a few hugs and kisses, I  opened the chocolate box and decided to share it with my love~ 

Yes it was a rather magical day spent with my valentine. <3

"event","So two days ago Phoenix and I went to a steakhouse. It was really goooood. I haven't had steak in a while so it was like a treat~ Especially to enjoy with Phoenix. He didn't look like the meat type of person..but since he suggested it, he can't hate it too much...right? I'm still planning on Valentine's dinner though. Hm...Maybe some nice french or italian restaurant. 

But I've bought Phoenix's gift! It's a surprise though~ I don't know if he'll like it..because I can't make things like he can. I've seen his stuff before and man! I wish I could make things with my own hands. The only things my hands can somewhat make is...Uhm...I'll get back to you on that.

Tomorrow is doom's day for Nathaniel's class! Mwahahaa! There's a super hard exam! Actually, it's not really hard, but I like to scare the class. That way they'll be all super prepared and then find out it's really easy. See? Mabe I'm not such a bad teacher person after all. Or am I? Who knows. I've been getting nicer. Maybe it's that effect Phoenix has on me.

Also, a few days back Phoenix and I went to a amusement park. It was really fun there. We played games and ate cotton candy~ I even won Phoenix a stuffed lobster! Now he can go join Muffin! I swear...that thing is out to get me. It has those creepy eyes that look into your soul and..maybe I'm over-thinking things. But it was a blast. I wish I could go again.

I'm drinking some hot chocolate right now. It's good. It reminds me of when Jule and I used to go to those cafes on our period breaks. We weren't supposed to I think...but we did anyway. I mean who needs us? [Even though Jule IS the nurse...but pshhh those kids can take care of themselves. They're not five.]

Ahhh Jaysin's birthday is coming up. Maybe I'll plan something with Phoenix? [*mumbles* Who knows, I might even plan with Nathaniel...] And it'd be perfect because Phoenix can bake a cake or something, since he's so pro at it. Luckyyyy.  I need a gift too. Drats. I'll just give him my brotherly love~

Well, I'm heading out to go jogging. Doctor said it'd be the best thing to do.

"event","It's been a while since Phoenix said that he would be mine. To tell the truth, hearing it come from Phoenix didn't make it seem real. I mean, it's wonderful, of course! But... maybe all the drama made it so challenging and exciting. But I should be happy now, well..I am! Duh. It smells like...flowers. Phoenix was shaking though, before he told me. I wanted to give him a hug, but...I didn't know if it was what he wanted. He might've run away again. But he didn't. It was almost perfect, maybe minus the romantic setting..but perfect nonetheless. I'm happy. No, thrilled.

So I've been taking Phoenix out places~ Most of them are out of town [just a bit anyway] so that people can't really see us...well..people from school anyway. They're probably just sitting around in their rooms. While we're having all the fun! Mwaha! Although I have to say, we're probably less noticable due to Phoenix's haircut. I wish Phoenix didn't do that just for me though. Although I'd quite my job anytime if it meant saving Phoenix the humiliation. Then...it's not a student-teacher relationship.

My stomach feels all weird. Ahh. I'm dying. The end.

Jaysin and I were talking about Valentine's Day. We both didn't know what we were going to do..but I knew if Phoenix and I were going to some nice restaurant...we'd better start making reservations. And fast. Which means I have to go gift shopping...because they'll be running out of stuff soon too. I might as well get Jaysin's early birthday gift? Maybe. 

I should call Phoenix tonight and ask if he wants to go somewhere tomorrow. I hear it's supposed to be a nice, sunny day...so we could always do something just...casual. I don't know what to do anymore. I've never been one for planning things and especially not DOING things. Yea..before I met Phoenix I never left the house unless it was work or...yea that's about it. Maybe clubs and whatever, but not much 'fun' stuff these young people do today. God, I sound old.

Maybe Phoenix'll have an idea. He's always good at thinking up stuff. <3

"event","Ahh I'm so tired. I've taken it easy for the past two days and look what happens. I become lazy. Therefore I'll recap.

On Friday I went to Jaysin and Nathaniel's play. It was quite cute besides the fact it was my brother and that creep. Well, maybe not creep...but HIMMM. Yes. At first I didn't know if I WANTED to watch since it was Sleeping Beauty...but I knew how much it meant for Jaysin if I showed up. With my camera! As suggested by Phoenix since he couldn't make it. But all in all it was really adorable. [I know..ME saying it was adorable?!] Jaysin had on this purple wig thing which made his hair look longer and more...curly? Just not too curly. I have to say, Nathaniel looked pretty cool also. Although I object to that kiss scene. I almost stood up and yelled something..but that would've been creepy. I heard some of the kids saying that it was good...a lot of the girls were practically in LOVE with Nathaniel. Psh. What do they see in him anyway?

So yesterday I...sat around I guess. I didn't do much. I hit Jaysin's club and just drank a bit. Oh yea. The doctor called me back. Yep. That's it. Maybe I went to go drown my sorrows. If I have any. Should I tell Jaysin?

And today! I'm planning on going to Phoenix's dorm. I have to think of an excuse though...how about..'Phoenix I have to talk to you about your history video..' But then we didn't HAVE a history video. 'Let me in so I can have a teacher-student talk.' No that sounds too over the top. 'Hello Phoenix, how are you doing today? Great? GOOD!' and then shove him through the door handing him the tape? No! AHH! I have to think of something. Or I can just always walk in casually. That works.

Well, I guess I should head over there now before it gets late. Then people might REALLY wonder why I'm over at Phoenix's.

"event","So yesterday Phoenix called Jaysin and I over. And on our way we saw somebody riding his damn motorcycle down the street. I'm going to run his down someday...but besides that. When we got to Phoenix's dorm room there were probably like..well, too many girls for comfort. Being..uh..myself, I used my teacher's status to break them up and send them to their rooms! MWAHA! And you thought only MOMs can do that. 

Well, we fended them off and knocked on Phoenix's door. I think we all just kind of stared at Phoenix when he opened the door. He...cut his hair. He looks so different now! Woahhh. I would've asked Nathaniel [since he was closest] to slap me to see if I was dreaming, but he would've just flat out murdered me. *sigh* oh well. Such a change though! Is it to keep away the attention? Lots of people did talk about his hair... So..?

But everyone seems to be doing some sort of play. Oh! Except Rekhat and Tarrant! But that's not the point. Good luck to the three of them for their upcoming play! Is Phoenix going to be Ophelia even with his haircut? 

The doctor called me and asked me to come in tomorrow. I don't know why. Blehhh doctors suck! Now I have to miss school/work/money to do stupid tests. He said it was a 'check up'. CHECK UP ON WHAT?! AH! This is suspicious if you ask me.

Today at school it's harder to spot Phoenix. Well, he has pink and purple hair but without it's longness, it's harder to spot him. Darn! Well it makes it a challenging stalk. I mean..did I say that?

Well, I'm going to go to Jaysin's club I guess. He's working now so I won't have some....lazy rude waitress or waiter. Those are the worst.

That or he'd rather watch that punk sing. Ugh. Oh well. At the last moment, I told Jule about karaoke-ing and she looked really excited. She must like it also...so I asked if she wanted to go and she said yes. We didn't have any extra tickets, but I paid for her. Hearing Phoenix sing was really...soothing? Same with Jule. They even did a duet. [we all switched off with everyone]. They sounded pretty nice. Jule sounded good with everyone. Maybe it's that feminine touch to the songs. It was a refreshing change. We should do it again sometime. 

Also...Phoenix invited me over to his dorm for some tea. I was surprised when he hugged me, let alone kissed me! But then we fell over somehow. Odd since I don't remember being so heavy I knocked over chairs...I saw Muffin, but what can HE do? But then a cupcake fell on my hair. I went to the bathroom to wash it out though. For the rest of the day, it smelled of icing. But hey, I'm not complaining. 

I wonder if Phoenix likes Nathaniel. He seems to care about him a lot, considering he asked about whether I was being nice to his during class. That and he works with him. Hm. Well, as long as Nathaniel doesn't hurt Jaysin...or there will be hell to pay for that motorcycle freak! GR! 

Oh yea. After we got home from karaoke, Jaysin told me about this play he was going to be in on Friday. It was for this day care center down the street and he asked if I wanted to watch. I said yes, of course...I have to make sure Nathaniel keeps his grubby hands off Jaysin since I heard HE was going to be in it too. Jaysin also said to invite Phoenix if he'd like to go. Jaysin wouldn't tell me the name of the play though. He said it was a secret and skipped off. Oh well...I wonder what it is.

Well, I have to help Jaysin with his studies in history.

Except for the minor fact that I feel like crappp. Well..I don't know why really, just...blah. But oh well. It only started recently. But when I think back on Nathaniel and my beating of that photo dude, it makes me happy again.

Thanks to Jule also, who could make this all possible. I asked her if she wanted to go to for tea or something. Even though I'd look strange in a tea house. Just picture it..people would stare at me. Period. Oh well. It'd be fun. Being all..delicate? Ahhh I don't know anymore! 

Today I asked Phoenix if he wanted to go karaoke with Jaysin and...Nathaniel on...well tomorrow. I apologized for such short notice, but Jaysin said that Rekhat gave him some free coupons? Something like that...since Rekhat couldn't go and neither could Tarrant. So therefore we get to go. Hopefully Phoenix says yes. Haha. It should be fun. Embarassing. But fun. Lucky for Phoenix he can sing. 

I'm going to go and visit Phoenix's dorm on Thursday to see how he is...how life is without a stalker. *cough* A uhm...bad stalker anyway. I mean, I learned my lesson not to stalk people..wait..didn't I? But yea..maybe I'll try to make cookies! With Jaysin's help of course..if he IS any help. Hahaha. The Echarpe family...destined to never cook EVERRR. We're just sad like that. I hope we don't burn our house own. 

I saw Phoenix today at school. It was fun since I got to bring Jaysin for my later classes since he got out early. God knows why though. Lucky kid. But he was following me around for a bit on campus. He sat in the classroom too, although in the student's section as to not bring attention to him? But he saw Nathaniel walking around on campus and he literally jumped on him. It was quite funny seeing his scared shitless face. Hahaha. Kodak moment. Damn. Where was my camera?

Well, I have to go make lunch for tomorrow!

"event","So Jule got me the key to that asshole's room. We went through with my plan, Nathaniel adding a bit himself. It was quite exciting though. I haven't had this much fun in a while. Strangely, it was fun ruining people's lives with NATHANIEL too. [yea that sounds odd since I like ruining HIS life...but hey. Who am I to complain?]

But after we saw him leave, we snuck in. I decided to let Nathaniel have the fun since he was the one that was more...well, IN the pictures. Kinda. So I let him sit in the photographer's computer chair, staring at the door when the time came for the guy to come back. So when he turned on the lights, he'd be in the room a little and notice Nathaniel. That's where I come in. I grab him, his throat, whatever it's all the same. As long as it hurts enough for him to shut up. 

So then Nathaniel gave a smirk and took out a metal bat that he put next to the computer and just swung away. I think the kid could've been pretty good at baseball..if there were any fights. But it was fun. After that I didn't even NEED to hold down the guy as he sat in awe. Maybe he had a heart attack? Then we could watch him die. Oh no, but we wouldn't want that..so we just ripped out his film and left his camera. In pieces anyway. A little part of me felt sorry..but that part of me got it's ass kicked by the part of me that wanted to murder the guy. 

But oooh the guy wanted payback. Well, at least that's what he shouted at us as we were leaving him. Sparing him the pain that wouldn't have came if he didn't say anything else. Nathaniel and I looked at each other and could almost read each other's minds. So we headed back to the guy's room and well..let's say he's going to have a hard time following Phoenix around in the hospital. Hopefully he learned his lesson. But idiots like him usually don't.

So all in all, it was a pretty good day today. After our reign of destruction, I went to the park with Jaysin. He was at Nathaniel's house after our..*cough* fun. He told me about Nathaniel's dog, Ty and how he was sick. As a get well gift, I bought the pup a chew toy and some bacon bites..or whatever they call them. Because seriously, who knows what kind of an owner Nathaniel is...look what he did to Jaysin! He corrupted him! AHHH.

It was a tiring day today..I am really tired right now. But I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to do that again. Ahhh what a wonderful day it was~

But I couldn't help but get angry, yet I tried not to show it too much. Nathaniel looked pretty upset too. I mean, hell, who wouldn't? It's a good thing Jaysin wasn't there. I don't know what he would've done. Well, I bet he would've tried to comfort Phoenix. It must be tough. So I took the pictures. I don't know what I'll do with them though. Put them somewhere until I think of something I guess..

Jaysin went to go visit Nathaniel today. It was strange walking up to the door with Jaysin, but I needed to talk to Nathaniel for a good twenty minutes. Oddly enough. I asked Jaysin if he could go play with Ty while I talked. Student-teacher deal. He agreed and left for Nathaniel's room and closed the door, as I asked him to. 

At first Nathaniel didn't like that I was in his 'territory'..but after we started talking about revenge, I think he started to ease up. We set the day for Sunday, a good day for him to be taking pictures. Out of his room. I have an idea...I passed it by Nathaniel. He hadn't told me about one so I said to tell me by tomorrow so we can 'get ready'. Haha. 

I thought that I could ask Jule to sneak a copy of the photo kid's dorm room. Then while he's out, we'll sneak in and wait. In the dark. So it's like a surprise party! Without the party! At least for him anyway. It'll be a freaking FUN party for us. As we make him watch us tear apart his computers, break the cameras and maybe his face. Who knows. We'll let loose.

Well, I have to sleep right now. I'm trying to break my habit of late nights.

"event","So yesterday I fell asleep at Phoenix's house. I felt bad since he actually went out to get food while I was passed out. [I was supposed to play doctor for HIMMM.] I didn't even know I fell asleep...but that's usually how things go. Right? Anyway..the food tasted excellent. I've never had Thai food, but now I know I have to go more often! Hell yeah! 

And then I saw the gum. Haha. I didn't realize that Phoenix knew I started again. Darn. It makes me feel so...horrible that he had to smell the smoke on me. But it was kind of him to 'tell' me. Hopefully the gum works again...and I don't get addicted to the gum. That'd be good. Now to get rid of my drinking...but hey. I don't drink much.

Phoenix said that since he was feeling better, on Wednesday we would meet at the cafe after classes ended. He also said not to tell Jaysin about anything. I feel kind of...weird leaving out my own brother. I wonder what it is though..what COULD it be? Is someone threatening/blackmailing Phoenix? If they are...ooooh man.

I'm still tired these days..ugh...but I've been sleeping normally now. No late night..smokes..I guess. So...one-ish has been a good time..yet recently it's like..I'm still tired. Maybe I'm getting too much sleep? Not enough? WHEN WILL IT BE PERFECT?! I need a new wardrobe for school. I love button downs..but I should wear something really out of the ordinary one day. See what they say.

I haven't talked to Jaysin that much since anniversary day. I bet that damn Nathaniel is taking him away...AREN'T YOU!?! *shakes fist* Ahhh. I'll just...yea sit here. Maybe smoke more? Haha. No no I'm kidding I think. But..I guess I've had my Jay-time...what am I saying?! GIVE HIM BACK YOU THIEFFF!!! 

Well, I'm heading out for a jog. Why? Resolution! YEA! Healthy Dusty all the way!

"event","So I asked Jule during one of my lunch breaks to go check up on Phoenix. Well, I never told her that I was trying to take care of him...but she agreed to. She's so nice, compared to her sister. Don't get me wrong, Villa is nice also, but she's also..how do I put it. Competitive and picky? Haha.

It seems that Muffin has a tendency to run away..maybe it's cuz I'm getting more attention than he is! No, just kidding. If I find him, I'll remember to go get a tracking device and stick it on him or something. How does he run away if he's stuffed? Maybe Muffin's an alien?

But I put vapor rub stuff on Phoenix. He felt really hot, but I guess that's the reason why he's sick. I hope he gets well soon because...falling behind in college classes is tough. I would know..I used to ditch until I learned my lesson. 

I've noticed that lately, my eyes have hurt really badly. I started to wear my glasses around everywhere I go because they make me eyes feel a little better than when I don't wear them. I think it might be because I'm tired still. I keep telling myself I'll go to sleep early, but it never happens. I felt bad though because when I was taking care of Phoenix, I brought him some broth and maybe a good ten-fifteen minutes later he was out. For a while I just sat there, watching him and looking around the room thinking...and then I fell asleep too! I'm supposed to be taking care of him, not sleeping more than he is!

I'm at home right now though. I just got back from Phoenix's house. He was asleep when I left, but I left him the rub and a little note saying that I'd come back later to help with some dinner. I wonder if people see me going into the dorms...that would suck. Damn.

Jaysin just left for work. I seriously think that kid should take it easy..lay back. But then again, he might become me! That wouldn't be good...maybe he should have a job then, but not with Nathaniel [bad role modellll]. I've been going to the club more often since I like the atmosphere there...besides the loud, noisy music, I like it because it's dim and..it smells like..alcohol and smoke. I'm just weird..but I'm used to it more than a coffee shop I guess. That and when I go there, people leave me alone. In the coffee shops, little old ladies come and talk to me [it's mostly lecturing]...I don't mind, but sometimes I'd like to be...alone? I like to think to myself, not talk about why I dyed my hair like that or be lectured that smoking is bad. Yes. Smoking is bad. Don't do it kids.

Well, I have to eat dinner and prepare something for Phoenix within..two hours! Do I have enough time? Let's hope so.

"event","Wow it was a long day. I went to classes yesterday to find Muffin sitting on my desk. Luckily class hadn't started yet and nobody was in my classroom to actually see me jump up so high I hit the ceiling..well..maybe not that high..but it damn well felt like it. Is that stuffed animal stalking me?

I returned it to Phoenix when I came over again after school. He seemed happy that I found him..although he was just as surprised as I was when I told him where it was...or maybe it was a cover act and he actually put it there himself..although that would be hard since he's sick. Such a shame. Phoenix is probably heartbroken that he can't go to school. If I was him...I'd be kicking back and enjoying my time off...but that's me. In high school, I was the opposite of him...I never studied, ditched all the time, drank, smoked...damn I was messed up. Still am actually..maybe I'm 'repenting' for my high school days...who knows..

All I know is I'm helping Phoenix. Before stopping by, I ran over to my house and got some vapor rub to help clear his breathing in the chest and/or nose. He seemed like he was having a hard time with his breathing..he was taking such deep breaths..it made me kind of sad to see him like that..yet..nevermind. Haha.

Afterward, he sat up a little and I combed his hair since he was probably too weak to. Surprisingly for such long hair, it's not really tangled! No fair! I wish I had hair like that..mine is straight..but sometmes it's like...'what? Do I have a jungle on my head?' Ughhh. That sucks.

My eyes seem to hurt recently. I think I need to go to sleep more often. I stay up too late doing..well..mainly nothing. Sometimes I go outside to smoke..or lock myself in my room and read or stare at something and think..but, I don't know. I'm not really motivated to sleep...but now it hits me like a brick and it sucks. I was walking around campus and I felt like falling over. Maybe go to sleep or something. How sad would that have been?

Well, Jaysin should get off work in a few hours..so I'll go buy a pie and eat some with him at like..one in the morning or something..assuming that he comes home of course. So...I'll go bring something warm and edible for Phoenix to eat~ I hope he gets well sooon~

"event","Phoenix called me today and he sounded...different. He told me he was sick and I was a little worried. I said I would go and help him, I CAN make soup or something. Dunno what else Phoenix would like. I'll bring some of our cough syrup and cough drops. I just got back from his house to pick up some more blankets and stuff. He went to go take a bath so I told him I'd be back in half an hour or so...I have around fifteen minutes left.

I feel sad to say, but I started to smoke again. I've gone past that...one month...part where you shouldn't quite be addicted anymore....but I don't know why I started again. This freaking sucks. I try and try..but ah. Hopefully I don't smell like cigarettes. I don't want Phoenix to be..well..hanging out with some addict or something. But smoking makes me feel better. 

He asked me to go to this cafe with him once he feels better. I hope that's soon, I'd hate to see Phoenix sick for too long...or anytime at all. Three days without Phoenix at school...what a drag. Too bad it's not Nathaniel. I wonder what he wants to talk about..it must be pretty important. 

I noticed that I haven't seen Muffin around the house. I asked Phoenix where he went, but he just smiled and changed the subject. Is he lost? I tried to look around a little once Phoenix wasn't looking...but I haven't seen him. If that pervy photographer took him to blackmail..I'll punch that punk's face off.

I came to pick up Jaysin after school today. He seemed happy. I'm assuming that they had a good night last night. If Nathaniel even TOUCHED him...there will be blood! Or..not cuz that'd break poor Jaysin's heart...but...oh well. Mother finally came home last night. At first she said it'd take a little longer because she decided to stay longer and then the flight kept being cancelled. So she was glad to be home. She seemed pretty happy too. Which is good.

Anyone that's happy is good.

"event","School today. Ugh Mondays are horrible. I want to kill them. That and I'm really hungry right now...but so far I've been doing well with my jogging! I WILL be uh...healthier? Hahaa. Hopefully.

So, during my classes, I was kind of bored. I just basically lectured the same crap for two periods and then other crap for the rest of the other classes...eh. That why being a teacher can be so...boring. NO! Oh well, I get paid I guess. That and I see Phoenix..but he's always working. Damn. There's always other people too. Stupid students..

Maybe I'll go get some cinnamon rolls tomorrow. That sounds good. Breakfast! That just blows my whole jogging thing RIGHT out the window..but I don't give a shit right now. They just sound too damn good! Maybe I'll get one for Phoenix...I think I will. If he doesn't want it..I'll uh...I dunno. It'll probably taste bad compared to his own [if he makes them anyway...]

But I visited Jule in her office area thing today. I don't really have a free class anymore, so it's not too often. I just visited during lunch and asked how her holidays went. She told me some stories about Villa, what's his face, and Nate. Nate is such a psycho it's not even funny. He scares me.

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. This sucks. Stupid...ugh. Everything to me is stupid except for certain people. Nathaniel seemed to be happier since I gave him his test back. It was an A. Minus. I stood there just to see his reaction. He looked up at me and gave me an evil glare as if it was some sick joke I was playing on him. Haha. It was an awesome moment. I wish it was a sick joke, then I could laugh. But I only gave him a smirk and passed on the other tests. The other students probably thought I was a maniac just standing there next to Nathaniel and staring at him. It was like a mini World War III...and all in an exchange of glances!

Next topic. Jaysin's anniversary is tomorrow! He said he got Nathaniel's gift, but he won't tell me what it is! Damn! Oh well, I only have to wait one day. 

I guess I did what Jaysin does, although I might not be that great at it...but I actually kinda succeeded in pretending to be normal! Typing this up, I actually FEEL normal..although deep down I'm probably murdering someone right now..but you don't know that.

"event","Sooooo. Today I got the package of my order in the mail! I was totally stoked and picked it up and hid it in my room. It's for Jaysin and that punk's anniversary. I ordered this maybe..a month ago? Who remembers anyway..It's not much, literally..but I didn't want to be all old and give them...plates or whatever it is people give for anniversaries. But it's those rubber bracelet things..Well, there's a semi-dark purple one [and says Jaysin] and a blood red one [which says Nathaniel]. Of course, I'm giving Jaysin the red one and Nathaniel the purple one..so..I dunno. They don't have to wear it if they don't want it.

But..wow..today it was so creepy. I was sitting on the couch and all of a sudden I hear Phoenix. Damn..I bet China could've heard me from my house. But man, did Phoenix look scared, I probably blew out his ear drums too. Wow. But..yea. He came over. I tried to be my normal self, I dunno if it came through or not. I was never good at that kind of stuff like Jaysin is. 

When it came to seeing Phoenix off, I made sure to walk him to the bus stop and pay for his fee. To tell the truth, I didn't really want Phoenix to leave, having him there made me feel..I don't know, normal? But I knew that it would creep him out so I just smiled and waved. 

I'm making sure that I'm my normal self starting..uh...tomorrow? I need those abilities to hide my emotions like Jaysin! I should take lessons or something. Or..maybe I'll just show my emotions, I don't really like to be fake. Therefore..I'm sorry people but you have to wait out my dramatic depression..state thing whatever. But I'm making sure that for their sake, I'm going to be happy for them on their anniversary. The last thing Jaysin needs is a depressed brother.

Well, Jaysin left for work about..an hour or so ago..Nathaniel came and picked him up. Which reminds me.. Phoenix's song was really nice. It'd probably be sickening for me to tell him that the lyrics were very..soothing? I wonder what inspired him..because I heard he wrote that himself. I forgot who told me..maybe Phoenix said it out loud. I think I was too drunk to remember. Did I drive myself home? Who knows.

I'm so tired lately. Nahhh I'm just really lazy. Haha. Maybe I should go do something like go jogging. That's it! Plus, losing some pounds will do me some good. I'll go at nighttime since it's cooler. That and I can't really jog everyday during the afternoon and in the morning...ugh forget abot it, who the hell jogs in the morning? I've decided. I'm going to start that! My new hobby! [and to think..my old hobby was probably smoking..] But but..YES! I will start..NOW! Okay, I'm going to go through my drawers and find me some basketball shorts and a t-shirt!

"event","Ahhh I went back to school and it was so gloomy. Well, mainly cuz this week is the 'I didn't WANT to come back' week...and everyone's just out of it. I felt like that too..and guess what..I didn't! Well, I did today though...I didn't think missing a WHOLE week would be too nice. But I was dreading my new class. Not only was Phoenix there, but I have to do an introduction and get to know everyone's names. I'm not too good at that. It's hard to try and keep my focus away from Phoenix...it's like..I want to look at him, yet since I'm actually his teacher now...it'd be creepy. Damn the principal. I bet it was his secret plot. 

After school today I was knocked out. Not just because of school, but I've been up late lately just thinking. Stuff like what happened on New Years and just everything in general. Even about Villa...which seems kind of strange..We broke up in what..mid-college? That was a few years ago.

But I woke up in time to head to the bar. I was still tired though and fell asleep at the table. Luckily, Jaysin kept me from getting kicked out. But Jaysin woke me up when Phoenix came out from his auditions. Jaysin told me he wanted to be a singer there...and maybe even a waiter. That's nice, I prefer that than his old job anyday.

Wow, it's already the weekend. Then again, I had such a long break..I don't know...I feel so...I don't feel like I can teach Phoenix's class. But I have to treat him like everyone else, I don't want to be one of those 'favorites' teachers. Although I do have those 'WRAH I SHALL KILL YOU' lists. Nathaniel is on it. Ugh. I'm so pathetic that even right now...I have to admit that kid isn't too bad. Wait...am I drunk? Did I just say that? 

Oh gosh. I should go call Phoenix..wait..JAYSIN! I'll call him and tell him the world is ENDING! My god! We're all doomed."

Eh, who cares...Maybe I'll go back to school tomorrow. I just don't feel like it. *sigh* I don't want anything to do with the damn school. I got a letter on the third though, telling me the class I was going in for. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad..but I'm teaching Phoenix's class. Maybe that's why I didn't show up yesterday or today. I'm wondering if it's really a good idea. But, I've given it some good thinking and I realized I need to keep my job...for however long it lasts. 

Jaysin seems extra happy because next week is his first anniversary with that guy. Nathaniel. Even if it is Nathaniel, I still feel happy for Jaysin. Watching him sitting there smiling all the time makes me feel all weird inside...it also makes me feel old for some reason. Ah to be young again~ [even though I'm twenty-five now some people think I'm old..*mumbles*]

It's noon. Almost. Eleven thirty-eight. I'd still be teaching I think...wow, it feels nice to take a prolonged break. Maybe I'll head out and eat somewhere, I haven't done that by myself in a while. I even feel like walking! Wow, I'm a changed man. Not really...considering I'm ditching school. Damn. Now I feel all bad again.

Maybe tonight I'll go to the club Jaysin works at. I'll disguise myself and spy on Nathaniel. Or just get something to eat. I wonder if Phoenix would go with me, but I don't want to ask him. What should I do?

"event","Well, ever since New Years I've been just loitering around the house. I didn't really have any energy to get out and do stuff. I don't know who I'd go with anyway. Jaysin is out with Nathaniel...well, they're working right now. Sometimes it makes me wonder if it's a safe job for Jaysin...I mean there's only drunk people there..that any Nathaniel...which isn't too safe either. See? That's what happens when I just sit around all day! I start to worry like an old man.

I was reading books all day. I started reading this one book, it's eh..kinda boring, but it'll probably [hopefully] get more interesting later. It's actually not a history book, which is strange because that's usually all I ever read.

So after returning to Nathaniel's house and spending an hour after his ice skating adventure, he walked home I guess. I didn't see a car or anything, since Nathaniel usually walks to the door or waits for someone to open the door before Jaysin waves to him goodbye. I wonder if everything's okay. 

This whole week, I don't think I'm doing anything. This is such a drag. Oh, I did get a call from the college. The principal said I was going to teach an extra class. He didn't say which level of history I was teaching yet, but I am teaching more. Which is good, in a way, yet not. I'm just anxious to hear the class.

But I've been thinking...maybe after this school year I'll quit. Who knows what I'll do..but I'm just thinking about it. Maybe more teaching somewhere else. Or go back to Jaysin's high school. Well, by then it'll be 'old' high school since he'll be graduating this year. But, I don't know..I'm kind of just sitting around thinking about all these things. I must've gotten at least ten/eleven hours of sleep..which almost never happens.

Bahh. But nothing interesting really happened today. Or yesterday. But I feel like such a...I don't know. I just hope everything's okay. I hope Phoenix is okay. I hope Jaysin is okay..dammit I even hope Nathaniel is doing okay. Is the world ending?

"event","So late last night/early this morning I had Phoenix and...that guy over at our place. It was really fun. My mom was out since one of her friends invited her over. She said she'd be back in a week or so [considering it takes a while to get there. Well, maybe five hours or so.] But yes. I'm the 'man' of the house now! Well, naturally I was since my father died, but now I'm actually in charge. Five foot radius for Nathaniel! Mwahaha!

But during the countdown this morning, I think I freaked Phoenix out. I kissed him exactly when the clock hit twelve and afterward he just kind of...looked...out of it. I don't exactly know how to put it, he just stared and looked at everybody and ran to the bathroom. Me being as stupid as I am, didn't know if I should have chased after Phoenix  or not..It seemed like the right moment for a kiss..but maybe Phoenix wasn't ready. Maybe he doesn't even like me. 

I decided, maybe I'll keep my distance or so. I mean, I know how I feel...but Phoenix. I think he's thinking about the teacher/student deal. To put it truthfully, I couldn't give a shit if I was fired. I'd miss a couple things or so, but it's not like it's the greatest job ever. 

So Jaysin got up and went to talk to Phoenix. I was probably the last person Phoenix would want comforting him. Maybe once Jaysin leaves, I'll go apologize. But I sat there on the couch, hearing murmurs of Jaysin talking, listening to the fireworks..and for some reason I couldn't turn my head to even look at Nathaniel. Usually I can just look at him and give an evil glare, but today I couldn't even face him. I felt like a complete idiot. End of story.

After a good fifteen minutes or so, Jaysin left the bathroom. He seemed kind of down, but that's expected. So I gave a long sigh and went to the bathroom. The door was shut again, so I opened it slowly. Phoenix was sitting there and I couldn't help but apologize over and over. He didn't really answer, but...I can understand. I might've moved too fast. I'm so sorry, Phoenix.

I offered to drive him back to his friend's house..whoever it is, but Jaysin said Nathaniel would take him home. Maybe Phoenix got upset because he likes Nathaniel? I don't know. I noticed that sometimes he would always look at Nathaniel, so maybe that's it. I don't know. But have a happy new years today everybody.

I meant that in a nice way..not to diss Nathaniel [although I wouldn't mind doing that anyway]. But it's just not his typical kind of clothes...so..I took Jaysin to the club yesterday myself...for one sole purpose. I walked into that bar, with Jaysin of course, and stomped off to the bar counter.

Nathaniel was cleaning some of the jugs or whatever and he looked surprised that I was there. But I told him clearly that if anything happened to Jaysin..he. would. be. murdered. Not the murdered where they're just dead...he'll be slaughtered! DEADDDDDD ARGHH. Okay, I'm done. But Jaysin did come home...just late. Too late. Ughh kids these days. Always stressing out their brothers.

I'm eating bread with refried beans on top. It's good. I had it at a friend's house and I was like...'wow this is heavenly.' So, yea. Today I'm just lounging around the house. That and grading those damn students' papers. How boring...but that's my job I guess. Surprisingly, Nathaniel did better than usual. Hmph. I guess I'm doing my job pretty damn well then if Nathaniel can do so well.

I think after this I'll head over to Jule's place and have some hot chocolate. I think Phoenix is working right now...and since us school employees have until the third off, we might as well use our time wisely. [otherwise we'll regret it when school starts.] Yay. A plan. Hopefully she's home...

I remember one time Villa came over and stared at it for a good two minutes before I had to help her. I have to say...it is pretty damn old. Why is it still running? Hey that reminds me of my crappy car.

But our paint war was settled, showers were taken and then Phoenix comes out in only a towel. Maybe I overreacted by leaving him all alone. I kind of feel bad now, but I didn't want to stand there feeling like a perverted old man [damn that Nathaniel for getting me that damn magazine!]. Technically I'm his 'teacher' even though I'm not HIS teacher so it's not TOO illegal...right? Damn teacher x student law. If they're over 18, does it matter? That's what I thought. NO.

I bet that fool Nathaniel will cause even more...pain to my ears and have even MORE insults as he sees me with my new glasses. They're rectangular, yet rounded..what's that called? Hm. But they're framed with this dark wire..thing. I use it only for driving and studying/reading...this bites. UGH. Which is basically ALL THE TIME..but not on Phoenix dating days! Yay.

Phoenix's cookies were so yummy! I was literally sitting there holding the cookies thinking how freaking good they were. Then I ate a couple more and skipped over to mother's room and gave her some. Sad for Jaysin because when he comes home there might not be any left, because mother loved them too. Sweet~

Jaysin seems to be more mellow now when he comes home..before he used to be all giddy and hoppy when he walks through the door, and now it's just like..'plop' on his bed. Then he gets up and takes a shower after a couple minutes of just staring around. Which, in a way, is good because the walls aren't dented in now since he's not jumping off the walls..but bad because he's usually always in 'happy mode'..or whatever. Well, I'm sure it's just a phase. Psh..to be young again.

"event","Wow. Christmas was so nice this year. Last year it was just Jaysin, the bum and me. It was fun having an extra body and animal around the house. 

But I went to Nathaniel's place for the dinner. I was planning on having Christmas at our house, but Nathaniel invited us instead. This means that we didn't have to clean the house. Yay for us~ Jaysin and I were relieved because we're so bad at cleaning the house..it's scary. 

I hope Phoenix liked his gift. I didn't know what else to get him. I was walking around and like...gazing at EVERYTHING. My thoughts were 'I should get him this' or.. 'No! THISSS!' But I picked out some of the top stuff on my 'to get Phoenix' list. He got me these kewl leather gloves. I should drive my old car with them and step out of the car and be like..'Tah-dah~' And have my students laugh at me. Wait..that's bad. I guess it can be a stylish thing AND a weapon! I can hit people with it. Like..'shut up! *slap*'. But I'd never do that. I mean...I like to torture them by giving them 'no-hope' quizzes, but I'd never abuse my heavenly students~ [or would I?]

Yes yes. So I drove by Jule's house and dropped off her gift. I had to run more errands afterwards so we couldn't actually do anything more than that...but I got Villa a little something too, considering..yea.

I'm painting my room right now. It makes the whole house smell like crap. But instead of that boring white-gray room, it's going to be a light blue color. Why I chose such a spring color...who knows. Jaysin wrote his name on my wall, since I'm not done and the paint was just lying around. *sigh* Sometimes that kid never...grows up? I don't know.

Jaysin started working again today. He had a break starting Christmas and it ended yesterday. [the day after Christmas?] Which is sad because I didn't get to spend any time with him. Damn that Nathaniel...spending more time with him than ME! Ugh.

"event","Tomorrow's Christmas...already. Lucky for me I already bought my gifts. 

For Phoenix I got these pink boots. They're not cowboy boots, but more of the fashion type boots, I guess you would call them. I'm not one for this kind of stuff. I also got him a messenger bag for him to carry around his school stuff. I'd hate to see him break his arms with those five million pound books. Anyway, the bag is light light pink with bits of magenta on it. I thought it was pretty kyute. I also got him this picture frame [who does that? picture frames are so last year] but I figured that he might get homesick or something, so he could always stick in a picture of his father or something...or whatever he wants. Haha.

For Jule I got this outfit, minus the pants. I don't want to ask her size and I don't want her to be offended if I get the wrong size or something. But I got some blouses/shirts for her. They were pretty kewl. If I was a girl, I'd so wear them. I also got her this silver bracelet. It's pretty and has a clasp. There's a small design on it, but it's small and elegant looking.

For Jaysin..I didn't get much because we agreed not to spend much on. This way we could spend more on other people. Also, we spend money on each other during the year anyway, so it's like Christmas throughout the year? But I got his this silver cross necklace because he's into crosses. He's not religious either, but I guess you don't have to be.

Tomorrow Jaysin and mother and I are just going to hang out and open stuff I guess. I dropped off presents to Jule and asked Jaysin to give my gift to Phoenix, since he'd see him before me. I'm sad, but I have to wrap gifts for mother. But wrapping isn't a big problem because I have off work anyway. So, Jaysin is at Nathaniel's right now just for a short exchange. Yea...

I'm so tired now. I've been wrapping all day. I'm sleeping on the couch tonight! Sadly, it's a kewl thing for me to do. I love sleeping on the couch, but mother won't let me do it everyday...only sometimes. [it feels weird to take orders from mother, but oh well]. She's still my mom.

But merry Christmas to everyone. <3

"event","So I came home from the movies [and went by my lonesome]. I don't know why...but I was afraid of asking people since it's so busy. People have more important things than fool around I guess. But the movie was..eh okay. I'm not much of a movie-person though..

But Jaysin came home late from work yesterday. He seemed a little out of it. I don't know why..but I asked him about it and gave this strange look. It was as if he didn't know he was acting strange. But after that he acted normal? Maybe he put up a better shield or just got over that was bothering him. Who knows? Hopefully everything's okay. 

I think Rekhat invited him over tonight. I think they wanted Jaysin to help judge because their band is getting a new member? Something like that. Oh well. They needed three people for it to be..somewhat fair I guess. So that's how it is. He just left. Ahhh I should drive him. I'll be right back.

Ahh back. When I dropped him off it was so loud. Ahhh kids these days. 

So I took Phoenix, Jaysin, Rekhat, and Tarrant out for dinner yesterday. It was fun. At first there would be awkward silences but Phoenix made the best of it and brought everyone together. Eventually we broke Tarrant's barrier and he laughed. I still say he should've at least taken his damn headphones off. He's not even listening to anything! It's just a stupid cord dangling from the headphones to...nowhere it just hangs out.

But anyway. It was nice, except for the part where I paid for everything. I don't mind paying for Jaysin and Phoenix, but it would've been rude not to pay for his friends. So I paid. Hopefully Phoenix won't give in to Nathaniel's bad habits while he tutors. I know this is completely off-topic, but Nathaniel is going to brainwash the poor kid! Well, that'll give me an excuse to go in there and beat someone up! AHA.

During the month off I think I'll ask Jule to go hang out somewhere. Maybe get some...coffee/hot chocolate? That'd be kewl. Just a teacher/nurse's night out. Awesome. I'm such a busy person.

When I was driving Jaysin to Nathaniel's house, we saw Phoenix. I wonder how Nathaniel is brain-washing that poor Phoenix into coming over. *mumbles* I bet it's something bad! I bet he's trying to cheat on Jaysin..if Nathaniel ever does that I. Will. Kill. Him. But Jaysin seemed fine so I dropped it. 

I heard that the college was kicking the students out of dorms...hm. I'm still new to this kind of stuff, and I lived at home during my college years so I don't remember if kids got kicked out or not. But I knew that Phoenix dormed so I asked him if he wanted to stay over at my house for the month off. He said he was staying at a friend's house though...

Jaysin's really hyper right now. Why? Hopefully he's not excited to see that bum Nathaniel. Ugh. Jaysin should spend his weekends doing something..productive. Or hang out with the right kind of people. 

I saw Phoenix the other day walking around and asked if he wanted to go for dinner tomorrow. I said Jaysin would bring his non-Nathaniel friend also and it seems that Rekhat is bringing another friend [but he did ask for permission.] The other friend is Tarrant, a bandmate of Rekhat. I have yet to meet him. But anyone seems to be better than Nathaniel. 

Anyway, Phoenix has to call me back...but I still can't wait.

"event","So I fell asleep during one of my class periods. I guess I was lecturing then told everyone to do what they wanted and then I went to my desk and fell asleep. When I woke up, half the class was gone..but who cares. I sure don't. Besides, I know who the ditchers were. [damn the fact that Nathaniel didn't leave. If he left I could've failed him...or something.]

But I've been feeling tired lately. It sucks. I don't even know why. Hopefully I don't fall asleep in anymore classes. That would be a bad thing. Maybe. I could go ask Jule what's wrong with me..if there is something wrong with me. I think I'll go ask just to make sure...I guess.

I slept during my lunch break and after school was over I went shopping..only for an hour though. I could barely stay awake after that and went home and crashed the bed. I got more of my gifts taken off my 'to do' list...I'll show my gifts to Jaysin [except his gift that is] when I get them all. See if he approves of them? 

Jaysin's working right now..and probably hanging out with that punk. Maybe I should go over there and separate the two. I'd have to order my drinks from Jaysin..or something. Who knows what that Nathaniel kid might put in mine. Some kind of illegal drug from god knows where. [I think I'll ask Jule if she wants to go to get coffee/lunch during our breaks tomorrow. That'd be kewl.]

I'm thinking of changing my hair back to how it was when I was like...teenaged. The streaks are getting to me and I just feel like..I dunno, a change. There we go. Maybe I'll get it done on Friday. 

Well, I'm going to go and make some apple cider..maybe. If it fails [which it probably will] then I'll go make some hot chocolate. I should learn to make apple cider to perfection and bring some to Phoenix! <3

"event","*yawn* I'm really tired..ughh such a long Saturday. I went shopping with Jaysin and Phoenix and got ditched..oh well. I got to sit on a bench for a long time. I wouldn't say it was fun...but..kind of refreshing. I was sitting in a place where nobody bothered me because they thought I was weird..but hey..I got some peace and quiet. But it was a relief that Phoenix had found me..otherwise I'd look around everywhere and get even more lost.

And then I went to the doctor's today for an appointment. It wasn't exactly great and ruined my whole day. When he was taking blood, he pulled off the latex band thingy to...block blood flow or whatever who knows, and then I was getting a rash. He told me I was allergic to latex. Uhm...ok that's strange. 

Hm..so most of the day I sat around at home in my room. I didn't feel like going out anymore that day and just felt lazy and tired and...basically slept. I felt kind of bad for not taking Phoenix out anywhere, but after that ice cream thing..I think maybe he would like some rest and quietness. Or maybe he's going to tutor Nathaniel or something. Pshh. Waste of Phoenix's time I tell you.

Speaking of school..well kind of, Phoenix thought it was bad how I was mean to the class. I don't know if he totally believes that I really dislike the class...It makes me wonder if Nathaniel is exagerrating? But maybe not..maybe I am too hard on them, yet I don't care because they caused it. I used to be nice in the beginning and then they pushed my limit. The limit? Having Nathaniel in my class. 

I think tomorrow I'll go visit father's grave. I asked Jaysin if he wanted to go, but he only looked down and shook his head. I don't blame him..father never..really...appreciated Jaysin enough. I loved father, yet I hated him for neglecting Jaysin. But I missed visiting today..which is kind of sad, but it'll make up for today by visiting tomorrow right? That and I think I'll take a nap there. Nobody will bother me and I'll be spending time with father.

"event","So I was talking to Jule [who can be found <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/medicalmistake"">HERE</a>] and she brought up her dog. Puppy. She told me about how her brother hated dogs, well, more like afraid of them. How pitifully sad. 

I just remembered that I've seen him before! When I was dating Villa! He didn't like me very much..I dunno why. Still don't, which is kind of depressing..but I didn't recognize him. Hahaha. He's just so uninteresting I just forgot he existed. But now that his presence is remembered...well..I guess it's just another person to torment!

I couldn't give a suggestion of a dog name. As everyone that knows me..knows that I am one of the most UNcreative people on the face of the planet [and with me is Nate and Nathaniel. Both 'Nat-' names. Must be a coincidence.] But yea...I said if I thought of anything, I'd tell her.

So Jaysin asked for a ride to his work today. I thought I'd take him and be a nice older brother..don't take that the wrong way..I usually DO take him when he asks, but he prefers to go with that Nathaniel punk. What does he see in him anyway?

Phoenix seems happier recently..maybe it's that tutoring thing. Hopefully it works out so well that he doesn't have to become an escort anymore. I don't think less of Phoenix..rather I just feel like he shouldn't do that because people will walk over him..or..other stuff. I can't let that happen! I'll save youuu~ 

And I realized that I hate show-offs. Seriously...I know I suck at art..but even if I was good at it, it's not my character to go and BLAB to everyone about how Picasso my picture is. If some stranger told me to look at his picture I'd probably crumple it and throw it back to him and say to shove it. But..since I'm a nice person, I smile and tell him to go away. The real story of this is that a student of mine is 'good' in art and started bragging. It gets quite annoying so I walked over to him and asked him to please pay attention and stop acting like a smart ass.

Even though he wasn't really a smart ass then, he sure acts like one in class. I bet I could just open my mouth and the kid would try to contradict/humiliate me in front of the class...even if he didn't know WHAT the hell I was going to say next! Ugh..I need some stress relief. Students these days just take the life out of you. Literally.

But whatever..I think I'll call Jule [cuz she gave me her number] to see if she wants to go for drinks tomorrow. I'd ask Phoenix but I don't think he likes drinking..hm. I'll ask him on Monday if he likes alcohol..I doubt it though. Does Jule even like drinking? Damn...I'm probably the only one. [if she says yes I hope I don't get drunk.]

Oh my god spider! *squash* Shit how I hate them. Back to gift talk...I couldn't decide between these two outfits for Phoenix. Therefore..I put them on hold so I can have longer time to think while they won't be taken! I'm a genius... And for Jule..I didn't know what to get her. I was thinking of getting her a necklace. I don't know what kind though..I haven't gone shopping for jewelry in a while.. I'm so..out of it when it comes to shopping. Every year my shopping is more like...random buying because I'm horrible when it comes to planning people's gifts. Sorry guys.

I heard about Phoenix's tutoring thing from Jaysin. He said I was being too harsh about that history exam. I guess he's kind of right..except for the fact that the class deserves the pain and suffering. I mean it makes ME happy, isn't that all that matters here? 

But I waited outside Mr. Thorton's house waiting for Phoenix as Jaysin sat there with me waiting for Nathaniel. It was pretty late and I was wondering if Nathaniel and Phoenix were having a sleepover or something because it seemed like forever. Hours and hours..but that's probably how much TUTORING Nathaniel needs anyway. Poor Phoenix for having to teach someone who's just going to forget anyway..oh well.

Afterward I wanted to take Phoenix for some ice cream~ So I did. He was telling me how Nathaniel had a huge history exam to study for. He went on saying that the teacher was being too harsh and that it wasn't right. I sat there for a while and wondered if Phoenix knew I was the teacher..or if I was a teacher at all. I guess I just assumed that he knew. It never crossed my mind that Phoenix thought I was a student. 

So I decided to break it to him? I just laughed there..in the ice cream parlor. It looked out of place, but it was funny. At least to me it was, Phoenix didn't quite get it yet. Then I told him that I was a teacher..and not just any teacher, but Nathaniel's teacher. I loved the look on Phoenix's face. Priceless. Afterward I drove him back to his dorm and walked him to the door~

So today while teaching..yea..'teaching'. Nevermind. I actually asked whether they wanted to learn something new, or study..they chose study, so I let them partner up and study or whatever. Hey, if they fool around it's their money, not mine.

During the passing period I visited Nate's classroom. I wanted to see what he was like. At first it was kind of strange because when I walked in it smelled like fumes, which is natural I guess..but when I saw him standing there..I was just..shocked. He doesn't really look like Jule. When I walked in the door, I just stood there and glared at him. Nate just kinda stared back while tidying up the papers on his desk...he must've thought I was a student..oh well. But after that I headed over to Ms. Fender's office because I'm sick. Sick of school. I ate lunch with her and shooed off the sick kidlets and told them to 'suck it up and go back to class, slackers' but Jule's too nice and took care of them. Dedication.

I SHOULD be shopping for gifts...I'll do it tomorrow. Plus, Jaysin just walked in from his work and he looks wiped out. [but he claims he's not.] I KNOW YOUUU JAYSIN! 

Back to business...I love watching my history class suffer. It amuses me. 

I saw Phoenix today. It made me happy. I hadn't seen him in a whole two days and it felt awkward. Usually I see him every minute and all of a sudden..BAM! Two days! When the hell did that happen? I must be getting old...damn.

I saw Mr. Fender at school. He doesn't really look like Jule. He does, but he doesn't. He's blonde. Not to be mean or anything..but he stands out from the two. And wow, he's seven years older than me! Jule is two years younger than me and Phoenix is...[I can SO count and subtract right!] six. I think..I'm surprised I passed first grade!

Since Jaysin was bored because Nathaniel has a tutor [which he deserves..I mean Jaysin's boyfriend can't be dumb or anything.] But who is it? Phoenix! I swear, if Nathaniel lays a FINGER on Phoenix...well..that finger just might not exist soon.

On to a brighter story~ Haha. Well, I don't have bright stories..so..they're all kind of pointless. But I was extremely shocked/surprised/pissed to find that we just hired on a new chemistry teacher [Mr. Fender]. The old one had been fired because he kept blowing things up and..all that good stuff that gets people fired. Who cares, that guy was an old bag anyway. 

But it didn't make me mad until I found out that Jule's last name was Fender. I ran over and asked if she was married, which she..wasn't! I was so relieved. [I don't know why either, it's not like I'm in love with her] But I also remembered Villa's last name was Fender...and she had a brother, Nate [which is the chemistry teacher] and damn I was confused. 

So...Nate is the oldest..I know that..but I don't know if Jule's the youngest. I'm pretty sure she is, but I didn't want to ask her age...cuz that'd be pretty damn rude, I'd say. [even though I was going to ask her tomorrow...yea..] So Nate works at the college. What a surprise. At least he's experienced in chemistry...unlike the old guy.

Ok..so..I think I'm going to go shopping sometime soon for Christmas gifts. Jaysin asked me to go with him for mother's gift, so I'll go then...and then later for Jaysin and Phoenix's gift. YES! I have a plan! That usually almost NEVER happens! What should I get them anyway? Darn..I'm so..non-gift giving person..I never know what to give anyone.

I'm sure Phoenix doesn't purposely want to sell himself to some rich-ass snobs...therefore he's probably just working for some extra cash towards dorm and book fees. Damn...I don't trust those dirtbags around Phoenix. Maybe I should teach them a lesson and send them to the emergency room! [Making Phoenix faint on stage like that! UGH!]

Shit! Someone just rang the doorbell and scared the living LIFE out of me. I think it was Jaysin's friend though...Rekhat? I dunno something like that...*sigh* GOD that scared me. I think I had a heart attack. Damn. I have to answer the door, be right back.

Ok so he just wanted to see if Jaysin wanted to go have a snack or something. Sadly, I don't know if I trust Nathaniel or Rekhat more. I mean..I've known Rekhat for like...a week and Nathaniel a year [or two..it's been too long to count] but I think I trust Rekhat more! How sad is that?

So at school today I decided to visit Jule again. I couldn't find Phoenix on campus. Which is odd..did he take another route to his classes? But I have a free class period so I just went to visit the nurse's office. Something about her just makes me feel at ease. [WTF I KEEP HEARING A BELL OUTSIDEEEEE.] 

But just talking to Jule makes me feel weak. Why? Cuz I'm a freaking...weak person! Hahaha. That's why I didn't major in english. But yes. I don't know. Talking to Phoenix makes me...hungry and talking to Jule makes me weak. Talk about confused.

I don't think I've ever been over in that area before, so I've never talked to her...then again I haven't talked to half the jerk teachers that work at that school anyway..But she was really nice, especially after my embarassing episode. 

Ughhh. So I was walking through the office area looking for the bathroom that was located in the health/medical offices. Why? Because I wanted to stand in a stall and crave another cigarette because I'm quitting those death sticks!  Anyway...I was turning a corner, about to jump for joy that I see the bathroom that no one ever goes to and suddenly this door opens in my freaking face! Holy crap! Since when did people actually GO to the nurse? Isn't that just an excuse to ditch class? 

But I started getting a bloody nose and cursed under my breath [because the principal was nearby..that jackass.] and walked into the nurses' office. I don't know what the hell they can do for a bloody nose. Maybe wave a magic wand and cure it, but I did anyway. The nurse, Jule, helped me..apply pressure to the bridge of my nose to help stop the bleeding? In a way she reminds me of my ex-girlfriend Villa...[damn that english teacher for stealing her away..*mumble*] But yea. I know that I like Phoenix, but something attracts me to Jule too...Maybe it's because it reminds me of my past. She reminds me of her, yet she doesn't. Jule actually helps me rather than laugh at me like some people. 

But meeting her made my day. At least..until I saw Nathaniel getting on his motorcycle to go home. That just blew my whole day into smithereens. I'll never forgive the fiend for taking away Jaysin. NEVERRR! Inforgivable.

It's all just so dumb that I can't think of anything to say.

I'm thinking of calling in sick today just to take some time off. Midterms are coming up really soon, I think. I can't even remember. I have to go shopping for presents though. Maybe I'll do that today? Hm...beat the crowd.

I also figured I'm going to buy lots more button shirts. I like them more, I don't know why. I guess I'm growing out of t-shirts. I'll keep the kewl ones though! Mwahaha. The shirts, I can donate I think. Yea. 

There is no food in the house. I am sooooo hungry! Poor Jaysin probably is too, but he most likely bums off Nathaniel. That Nathaniel's probably laughing at me because he can support Jaysin and I can't. Bleh. How embarassing...yet..I can't do anything about it. Considering I pay for mother also. Luckily, she pays for housing. 

So~ Hopefully I can get that dinner thing going tomorrow. Which means I have to go shopping for food too. Maybe Jaysin can help cook? Or maybe mother will cook too?

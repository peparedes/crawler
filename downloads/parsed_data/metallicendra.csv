P.S. Sarah's making something for me...I'm excited


I'm done with this. It's not even worth my time. You're not my friend and you never will be, you can be friends with my friends, and it doesn't change anything between me and them. I'm not gonna lower myself to name calling and random posting anymore. Please stop reading my journal and I'll stop looking at yours as well. And that's not mouthing off over the internet, I dont need to waste my time with this shit.

STOP CARING SO FUCKIN MUCH ABOUT ME!!!!! FUCK GOD DAMN....get a life!!!!!!"

"event","Love is so very special
Yet can make you feel so lost
It can arrive just like the springtime
And melt away like morning frost

You must find ways to nurture
Always grow your love with care
Never ever take for granted
The love that you both share

Mistakes are bound to happen
You may hurt each other's heart
Yet don't give up to easily
It will tear your love apart

Love resembles a bright flame
That lights a dark starry night
Never ever let this flame burn down
Rekindle with all your might

Take a moment every day
Look deep into each other's eyes
Never hesitate to show affection
Small gestures will keep a love alive

Talk openly about your feelings
Take time to show that you care
Treasure each and every moment
Because to find true love is rare

"event","OLP was aweeeeesome last nite! Sarah, her mom and I left nish around 10 and drove up to hali. We went to the Micmac Mall where we did some serious shopping. Well, I suppose I didn't buy THAT much, but it was good none the less. We checked into the Citadel Inn which is like 1 sec away from the Metro Centre and got all ready for the concert. There were like 3 opening bands which got kinda frustrating cuz I think everyone just wanted OLP, but they were all good anyway. OLP finally came on around 9ish and they were AMAZINGLY GOOD. Moments to remember: KEVIN, 4am and the lighters and a shitload of nosebleed section people getting to go up on stage. I always liked OLP but I think now that I've heard them live I'm reeeally into them. I'm like obsessed with ""starseed"". I think I'm gonna go get their live CD at Radioland, that or get Sarah to burn me it...we'll see. 

Anyways, this morning (after a noisey night at the Citadel :S) we went to the Shopping Centre n did some more buying. I got Dave a t-shirt from West 49 that is sooo cute. I felt I should do something after Thursday...OMG it was our *3 month anniversary* and when I got to Dave's after work no one came to the door. So I went downstairs to his room (which is like the whole basement) and there was a trail of candles that led to his bed and on his bed he had baked some cupcakes and spelled out ""I <3 U"" with iceing and printed a really sweet poem from the net and found a beeeautiful gold bracelet that used to belong to his mom. He laid all that out on the bed and I was like crying and he came up behind me. He turned on ""You and Me"" by Lifehouse which is the song we were listening to the first time we kissed. It was soooo sweet, especially cuz no ones ever done anything even CLOSE to that for me before. 

So at like 1:30 me n Sarah hopped on a bus. It was pretty slow, but we were home by like 5ish. We dropped her Dad off to golf and I went out to her place for a bit and now here I am. I think I'm gonna head out to Dave's tomorrow nite cuz I really missed him :( annnnd s'all good! bye bye for now"

"event","Sooo...my first year of university classes is OVER! I'm sorta nervous to see my marks though, so it sucks that they're not out until so late. I know I did good on psych and soc...history was KINDA hard (and it IS my worst class...so I just hope I passed) and english was my last exam, so nuff said there. And art is...well, art. I got a 90% on our last essay thing and it was worth alot, so I'd say that mark will be pretty decent. But I don't think I'm as anxious to get my marks back as Sarah is!! goddddd that would suck to be in your situation. Dah well! You're a smart cookie so no worries. 

My last exam was on Wednesday at 2 and it was kinda sketchy, so I wrote til like 4:30. I was soooo happy afterwards though! I was literally just calling random people afterwards and I was just like ""yay...YAY!! I'm DONEEEEE"". Anyways, that night, well, lets just say it was pretty much the best night of my life <3..Then on Thursday night I went to Stan's with Sarah and we just chilled there, watched the OC, had some pretty intense chats and a few drinks to topper off! Haha and when my Dad picked me up I was talking to him about how BAD I feel that everytime I decide to drink and not stay somewhere, they have to come and pick me up. I can call a cab!! But I guess they don't want that...pff parents for ya. Dave seemed really sad that night so I promised him I'd be at his house before he woke up the next morning! LOL which wasn't too difficult, seeing as how he doesn't wake up til like 12:30ish. So I got up around 10 and was out the door by 11:30. I love how I can just let myself into his house and his dad doesn't even think anything of it. So I woke him up and we went for a drive around the bush and then a walk on the beach <3<3<3 Went back to his place and we were just lying there in bed talking. I thought it might have been for an hour, but it was from like 4:30 til 8:30!!! I FREAKED cuz I had made plans to hang out with Sarah that night. So called her and then was on my way. Went straight to her house and we watched Casanova. Apparently it was a *sarah* movie :P It's not the type of movie I normally like, but it was not bad at ALL really. I liked it! Like, half way through the movie we paused it and just started talking...til like 12:30! Haha, never finished it, but I just went home. Slept soooo well last night. 

Now here I am. Did a bit of cleaning earlier, and maybe doing a bit more later. I also want to run uup to Wal-Mart later cuz I have a few thing to pick up...maybe with my sister? I dunno...Then tonight I think Dave's coming down here. I don't really know what the plan is...Sarah may be going out to the bar with some people, but if people are drinkin at Stan's beforehand I think we shall stop by there? I dunno...we be talkin!

EDIT: NIKKI we must hang out sometime soon! me n sarah were gonna call you n see if you wanted to hang out last night, but plans got kinda messed up...I'll be talkin to ya within the next couple of days!"

<P>Sooo lets see...Well SOME people have mentioned things about not reading entries that aren't in paragraph form sooooo...</P>
<P>Wednesday- huge fight with mom :S luckily, people were here to talk to. </P>
<P>Thursday- in the morning, went down to Havre Bouchie for a hair appointment. I got some really subtle light brown highlights, and a few layers around my face. When he was all done and my hair was dried, I totally looked in the mirror and was like 'nothing has changed'. You reeeeally can't notice a difference unless you look really closely. But it was a nice change, and I think I needed it. Thursday night, went to Super Store to pick up a few essentials ( &lt;3 that place) and then went to Sarahs to watch the O.C. It was sooo sad, but cute at the same time. I absolutely love that show, and I always wanna watch it with other people. </P>
<P>Friday- went by soooo fast! Went out to lunch with Sarah at Tim Hortens around 1. Picked Sarah's man up and took him to the liquor store for us! *LOL* Then we got Kelt and went to Sobeys for mix, and the dollarstore in the mall for glasses and such. Dropped them off then I had an eyebrow wax appointment at 20 after 3. Came home afterwards, did a bit of studying, then went back in town to pick Sarah and Ashley up, make a Needs stop, and go to our *cocktail night* at Kelts. We each had a Baybreeze (at Sarah's suggestion) first and they were sooo cute in our little martini glasses. Then I had a very alcoholic *pink* drink. It was gross. Kelt made me a Shirly Temple instead and I looooooved it. New favorite drink? I think so! We watched Austin Powers upstairs, and by then Sarah was gettin kinda sick, and Kurt was gonna be home soon and had ta work in the morning soooo Ash and Sarah left, then shortly after my Dad came to get me. *SO freaky-him walking up the stairs*... Just didn't expect it! LOL Good night all together. I was just thinking....I'm sooo thankful that I kinda got over the whole drinking-to-get-drunk thing. I love that us girls can just get to get, have a drink or two, and just chill, no drama, just hangin out. I &lt;3 it. I'm also proud of the fact that I don't really go too over the top with my drinking, and while I never really got sick, I've pretty much sobered up before I go to sleep at night. Which is cool. </P>
<P>Saturday- Studied my brains out that day...Seriously, got up at like 9 and studied straight til like 5. I have a Psyc test on Wednesday, but I'm not too worried about that, but I got a History midterm the next day. And History is my worst class, so I really wanna bring that mark up. Soooo studied History all day-ICK.Saturday night...</P>

<P>Mike Pasher, that is..although, I've never actually met the guy lol. He's just some random guy who somehow ended up on my MSN list. Anyways, the other day he asked me, then decided to give his friend Dave my e-mail address. So me and Dave kinda hit it off and decided to just meet at Tim's saturday night, and then take it from there. So, we met there and just talked for, like, a half hour to an hour. Then we decided to go for a drive. We took my car, and ended up down at the mall parking lot (hehe I'm so clever :S lol not). While there we talked for 4 1/2 hours!!!!!!!!! It was amazing. He's amazing. We're like, the same person,except not. We made out (and he seemed really nervous...it was cute!), and then decided right there that we'd sorta make it official. I kinda knew that would happen, cuz I liked the guy just from talking to him on MSN. And even though I really like him...I know I gotta take it slow. And I willl. I'm not gonna get in over my head because...with Mike anyway, not really Pete...I WAS in too deep...I'm never gonna let myself get to that point again cuz, honestly, that was sorta scary. And, OK, this is weird....Dave was Chelse's prom date!! :S I kinda remember her introducing us that night and I was just like: tall, dark....nice. I was way too infatuated with Mike at that time to even care. But that kinda puts me at ease a little, cuz Chels is a totally respectable girl and she wouldn't waste her time on a nobody. Also, the last girl he went out with...her older brother was good friends with dear old Mike (JK!!!...about the dear part lol). But we just kept talking and it's so weird the different ways we figured out that we're connected...we have the same hairdrsser! HAHAHA So, all in all....just a good weekend, good night...luvin it all. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Annnnnnd some general comments, lol.</P>
<P>-ain't it a bitch when people just really don't want someone else involved in their life, and they fuck off but yet they come back. Yes. </P>
<P>-I think me and Kelt just don't get to the giddy, off the wall hyper-drink part of drinking very easily. Maybe that's why we didn't seem like we were having fun? We just weren't loaded....just a thought! maybe...i dunno</P>
<P>-Rachel from sociology (completely different person from Rachelle, Emily's friend from the Mount) is so cute! She's little, and Chinese and Megan left for home on Thursday so it was just me and her for soc. class. She had some kinda English comprehension test right after, and she was all practicing and stuff. HEHE.</P>
<P>-I'm at such a GOOD point in my life. A year ago, I never thought I'd be saying that, but it's true. I'm really in love with life right now.I'm taking some interesting courses at school, in subjects I actually give a shit about, things are going decent, for the most part at home. I love the fact that I have my car, and I don't need to tell anyone really where I'm going, just the general, I'll be back at THIS time type thing. Goin' out with a great guy, and last, but certainly not least- my bitches :D hahahah love u guys!</P></FONT>"

Friday- Did shit fucking all. My excuse was that I'm still a lil sick. So I sat home and talked to Pete on MSN and watched TV! Sarah called my cell around 10 and wanted to see if I wanted to go watch a movie at Kelts with her and Ash. I HAD to decline though, I wanted to just chill at home and recooperate enough for...Saturday night!
Saturday- Well...started of with meeting Meg at the Mount to get my Soc. notes from her. Went to the library for about an hour before I realized I didn't really have too much work to do...So I left! LOL...Then Mike P. told me about that whole Dave deal and :D sounds good ta me...That night me and Kelt had decided to just drink at her place...but Sarah was havin a rough time so we decided to suprise her with ice cream (Twix!) instead. We were outside the Mount tryin to figure out a way to get in without having the Porter call Sarah (cuz we wanted to suprise her). I was on my cell about to call Em to come down and just let us in...then some person just started walking in so me and Kelt sorta sketchily followed her haha. It was so awkward cuz we were following her right up until the last turn you take to get to Sarah's room. She prolly thinks we're big stalker freaks...ah well! Then we suprised Sarah with the ice cream! HA..apparently we're lucky she even answered her door and she seemed really happy to see us :) So we just had a big girly talk and ate ice cream! Around 10 went back to Kelts to drink and Ash and Kat met us there...OMG TALKED TO NIKKI ON THE PHONE!!! I MISS U!!!!! Then Kelt just took out her ol geeetar n was playin up some tunes...I had like 1.75 coolers....it was all good. We were just havin a good time, not like totally smashed outta our minds.. <3ed it. LOL it just happened to spontaneously cuz I was gonna get Rachelle to get me some good, new drinsk to try but I thought for sure that we weren't doing anything..then *bam* Kelt calls...just like that *BAM* hahaha. So after Ash Kat and Sarah left me and Kelt just chilled, talked on MSN for a lil while before I left... Yeah, my mom just picked me up (LOL im so cool) and came back here...I was actually talkin' to Dave for like.. 1/2 an hour when I came home too. He seems like a good guy. Annnnnd Just got back from pickin my car up at Kelts! So, all-in-all pretty decent nite."

"event","<P>so i feel i should update...NOTHING much has been happenin' so i dunno why...that thing we had for nikki was fun...and it was soooo sad saying goodbye to her. we called her from sarah's wednesday mornin' though (more on that...) and i was talkin' to her last night before i went out. last night...we were just goin' on about stuff and everythings gonna be at university. she PROMISED to call me as soon as she got back in december soooo someone remember that. then tuesday, i forget what happened during the day? haha most likely just hung around the house/town and did nothing lol wow...really weird that i forget. anyways, went out to sarah's that night and stan was there with her playing scrabble hahah 'what word is that? knave?' then kelt and kurt came out and we watched marykate and ashley live at much (ahh the guilty pleasures in life haha) and played this weird game that we all just sorta threw together? haha i made up the questions and it was kelt &amp; kurt against stan &amp; sarah to see who knew each other better...it was something that me and mike just did by ourselves before sooo yes, sarah we'd prolly beat you guys!:P JK!!! it was cool to see how well the guys new you two and...a secret: i was seeing what answers i knew while we were goin' along. i must say, i know you guys PRETTY well....then that night we had a sleepover! soooo cool...me and kelt went back home to get her stuff and kelt to do some apt. shit then they picked me up around 11. some confusion about what 'being on her own' meant hahah luckily, when i told my rents that hers went there...they were completely ok with it. we just hung out there then went upstairs and had some good ol girlie chat til like 3 in the mornin. haha it was a good ol time! then we got up and went to tims around 10-11am...they were headin off to the avril lavigne concert (which i hear was awesome) so we had our coffee and bagels and dropped kelt off for a meeting with some apt. guy (i think) and sarah drove me home. aww you guys have no idea how fun/cool that was. it was weird, i slept in til 10 sooo i was pretty awake. just hung out here til after supper then drove out to mikes. s'always fun there...but then dylan brought his girlfriend kendra there too! haha confusing?! uh yeah...lol we fit our good times in though if ya know what i mean ;) left there around....10:30? cuz mike had to get up the next mornin' at 4 and then just came back here...sooo todays been pretty low-key. headin in town soon just chillin then hangin with mike later on. then tomorrow ill be helpin gill move inta her new place:) should be ok&nbsp;i'll probably be updating more before school starts (since this IS my addiction) buuuut i've already been thinkin' bout what a cool summer this has been. it had it's bad points, of course, but overall...i liked that i had more freedom and that i didn't abuse that freedom to the point where i'd have none...i also liked that i could drive this summer...and had my own car so i didn't have to worry about where everyone else was. finally, i liked that i didn't spend like every free moment with mike...i think that's what made it work... that i'd have nights where i'd be with friends or whatever and he had the same. and that i didn't HAVE to be out and gone or whatever ALL the time, i was ok with just chillin' at home cuz that's what i did every now and then...sooo the next night i was all ready to go! anyways...</P>

"event","<P>Holy Crap!!! So, on Friday I <EM>thought</EM> I was goin' to dinner with my sister...but when I got there it was a buncha my friends! Sarah, Ash, Kurt, Gill and Melanie Kaiser.&nbsp; I was <EM>soooooo</EM> suprised! Got some presents too....Sarah- that picture thing you gave me, seriously, LOVED it...sooo nice!:) It was awesome...we all ate then had cake *blush* I even saw Sarah's car parked at Shoppers and didn't think anything of it. Kelt called during the meal which was sweet. She felt bad that she couldn't come. But afterwards we went to visit her at Co-op. Then me, ash, and sarah all went to sarah's where Kelt joined us after work. She (kelt) told me that she wanted to get a tattoo of a duck on her ankle just cuz of the accident and all!!!! I seriously almost cried! So that was all good. It was almost 12 so we all started to head home but me, being me, I ended up in Sarah's ditch! :( SO friggin scary. But it all worked out, cuz my dad came and called a tow truck. I <EM>still</EM>&nbsp; feel bad that Sarah's parents had to get up to drive Kelt and Ash home though-tell them that again Sarah! But I got to drive home at 1....from a judges house:P hahaha soooo I was pretty tired after that and went right to bed. The next day was my actual birthday so Mike called me at 9am and said ""I'm on your road coming to your house right now"" So I friggin <EM>flew</EM> into the shower. He got here and I told him alllll about the night before. We had breakfast and I opened a bunch of my presents. Got lotsa cool stuff from my family. A St.FX travel mug thingie, St. FX pen, pillow, lamp, bracelet &amp; necklace,&nbsp; picture frame, keychain and my sis gave me a prom pic of me and mike--only it was made into a puzzle! very cool....Then me and Mike headed to NG and...............<STRONG>GOT MY TATTOO!!!!!!</STRONG> a pic....</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a342/metallicendra/Kendra004.jpg""></P>
<P>ummm....i don't think that worked? Well, I'll make it my MSN pic anyways....it's a pink rose on my back!! Ash and Sarah and Shan and Nikki seen it tonight anyways. Sooooo that pretty much pissed my parents off alot. That's not what it was meant to do. It IS just something I needed to do for myself though, but it WASN'T meant to be a big rebellious thing....totally went about it the wrong way. But still, I don't regret it. Mike got one on his chest too...hot? uh YEAH :) I'm happy haha. So then on Sunday I tried to taker easy a bit. I did go out to Pizza Delight with my sis hahah cuz she knew I was actually lookin' forward to gettin' dessert there with her on Friday night. So we just got Coffee and Dessert. Then today I went to Truro shoppin' with my mom and sis. Went to Margolians and got this really cute shirt (the lime colored one I had on tonight) for 10 bucks then 30% off so it was like 8 bucks!!! Awww I love cheap clothes. Shouldn't say that cuz then I went and blew $65 on underwear at LaSenza haha. Ah well...went out to Pizza D <STRONG>AGAIN</STRONG> tonight because it was a last chance to see Nikki before she leaves. Me, Sarah, Nikki, and Ash were all there. We ordered Garlic Fingers then our food then we all went up to the book store to look around. That's about all but I guess Sarah's havin' a buncha people over tomorrow night for a hang out thing/maybe party? NO PARENTS!!! woot! Either way, should be cool. And I know me and Mike are goin out for breakfast this coming Saturday (hehe stole that idea.....sarah) but other than that wide open n up for plans....X SOOOO soon, as we were talkin' bout tonight! ahhh!!</P>"

"event","Hey you guys!
Well...this week has been pretty ok. On Monday, at like, 11am, my dad pulls up the driveway hauling a friggin 27 ft long trailer (camper thing) Holy Crap! I was like 'What the hell?!?! CRAZY!' I have a friggin campground in my backyard now. People will have to come over for a dip in the pool and a night out in the trailer! We have elecctrical/water hookups soooo its all there. We're even getting a small TV/DVD player from Wal-Mart. And we've been trying to find ONE day when we could go down to Baddeck for a night. It's pretty hard though cuz my sis is at basketball camp, and my birthday and shhhhit like that. But anyways, Monday night I went up ta Wal-Mart to pick up Scribblers, pens and highlighters n stuff I'll need for school. Then to Eclipse! Got some reeeeally HOT jeans with sprakly crap on em! So then it was Tuesday morning and I had a good ol chat with Sarah. I'm glad we feel the same way about alot of things:) She was gonna have people over to her house the night before her and Ash left for Woodstock, but not enough people were free I guess...HOPE U GUYS ARE HAVIN FUN!! We'll definately do somethin we ya's get back. Then I went in town for a lil tour to look around X...might as well! Got myself a reeally cute lil X schoolbag and got like 10% off to! HAHA That makes me happy when I'm spending my own money. I dunno why he took 10% off buuuut no questioning from me! Next, I went to the orthadontist who told me I only gotta wear my retainer every now and then at night. I didn't have the heart to tell him, I only wear it now when I remember! Which is...not that often! Then that night spent like a good 3-4 hours on the phone with Mike. We were both too cheap to buy gas and travel out to the other ones house lol! Friggin 1.13!!! CRAZY ahhh well I'm just glad my lil rig is AWESOME on gas...which is more than I can say for Mike's Lumina:( SHIT Aaaaand Today...Went in town with my sis this mornin'. Went up to X again just to check out lil shortcuts and the such. We damn well almost got lost too! haha DONT ASK Went to Radioland to see if I could buy my Bro the new Trews CD but,as I figured, they were all out. Gettin' more in tomorrow though I guess. Aaaand just picked up a few things at Shoppers and places then went home. ANNNND...here I am. Prolly gettin' in the pool in a few and definately hangin' out with Mike tonight. Tomorrow, I should be in town bright and early then out to Mike's house around 2...that is if I can talk my Mom outta dragging me to Truro to go shopping with her and my sis:S ahhh SO POOL................out!"

<P><STRONG><U>Saturday:</U></STRONG></P>
<P>Breanne asked me to go to party in Port Hawkes. with her, but I had already made plans for a ladies night!!!! Kelt, Ash, and Nikki came over....GIRLIE MOVIE NIGHT!!!!! It was that kinda day. Watched 'Meet the Fockers'. Would you believe Nikki had never seen it, and Kelt had only seen the end of it??? So, it started skipping in the middle buuuuuuuuut toothpaste to the rescue! haha! Talked until about 10 to 12 (Kelt had 10 minutes to get home! tsk tsk) and I'm <EM>hoping</EM> you guys had a better time at my place than you did on Friday!! Oh yeah! Ash's Hollywood Guy is my 2nd cousin!! haha I was renting 'Spangalish' and he told me his mom's last name was Gottschall and theres not too many of us around so we're prolly like 3rd cousins or something. Turns out my Dad is his Moms cousin, so we're second cousins!! We'll definately use that to your advantage Ash!</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Sunday:</U></STRONG></P>

Took some pics with his new dig which I will post as soon as he sends em to me. Now, I'm home, headin to chuch tonight then prolly just takiner easy at home tonight.

"event","It's been awhile since I have updated this.  I have been extremely stressed at work so needless to say I haven't felt much like exploring my emotions here.  Well, now I have something to say:
I am not going in bdf anymore.  I am not updating this lj anymore.  I am disgusted with the way people come off in bdf.  I am sick of it.  I am a grown woman and the way people put me down is not worth my time.  I used to genuinely enjoy going into bdf and talking with everyone.  However, the past week or so, every time I leave I feel like shit.  I feel stupid and small.  I already feel this way EVERY day of my life from when I wake up until when I go to sleep.  I DO NOT need to get this anywhere else.  It's not worth it.  I am a smart 26 year old woman and I KNOW I am not wrong when I say that certain people in bdf are JERKS.  Many of them at that.  I have tried all different approaches.  I have tried being nice, I have tried standing up for myself...all with the same nasty responses.

I'm over it!

I am over this lj too.  I do not have ANY desire to have ANY of these people in my life.  Jack, Heidi and Dar...enjoy your little threesome.  I am sick of trying to penetrate it. 

Keelie...you are the ONLY one I will miss.  I will try and stay in touch with you somehow after I delete this lj."

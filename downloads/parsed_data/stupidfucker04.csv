"event","Well, here I am.  We won our game last night (Eisenhower and Youngsville) woohoo!!  Anyways, I discovered something...either people really hate me or they really love me.  When I got home last night I had 7 messages.  3 of which were from ex-girlfriends.  Two were from one, and the other from another.  Both girls have ""something to tell me"" but apparently they need to talk to me in person or on the phone...WTF??
I don't know.

I feel like bitching this morning so...here I go!

Do the parents of todays children piss you off?  Now I know most of you are going 'oh god, another teen ranting about his parents, and how bad his life is, he's just another dumb teenager who doesnt know anything about the real world.'  Well first of all, I'm not ranting about anyones parents in particular, second, I never said my life was bad, third, I'm not a dumb teenager, fourth, I probably know more about the real world than you do.  And just for the record, if I was like every other teenager you've seen, than the world would be a different place, because they would all be like me, not the other way around.  Anyways, back to what I was saying.  What I was getting at was, does the pussification of this country piss you off at all?  When I was at the game last night I was sitting at the top of a little hill probably 20 feet long, I can't remember what the exact incline was, but little kids could walk up it with no problem.  Anyway, I was sitting there and this little like 11 year old started rolling down the hill, like on his side, you know how to roll down a hill, well then this little girl who was sitting with her mommy went to roll down the hill and her mommy flipped out.  ""What are you doing? Don't do that, Carrie!  You'll get hurt!""  It pisses me off the way todays parents are trying to keep their precious babies from getting injured.  ROLLING DOWN A FUCKING HILL USED TO BE WHAT WE DID!! And I'm not even that fucking old!  I hate to say this, but even when I was a kid, parents used to at least not worry about us as much as today.  The way the world works is sad.  Another example which I'm sure everyone has heard of...Tipper Gore.  PMRC.  Censorship.  Dictatorship.  Who the fuck does this bitch think she is?  I don't give a fuck what she says, she's trying to censor my fucking music.  ASS BITCH FUCK CUNT.  You gonna come censor me, or arrest me, whore?  LOL.  Tipper Whore.  If parents don't want their kids listening to explicit lyrics...then geuss what...DON'T LET THEM BUY IT!! Take some responsibility for your fucking kids.  Stop putting them ritilan.  Stop blaming it on TV. Stop blaming it on music.  Stop blaming it on video games.  Blame it on whose fault it is: yours.  If your kids fucked up, not retarted, I mean like 'Cable Guy'-ish than it is your fault.  I don't care what is said.  If you need to put your kid on ritilan, than maybe you should reconsider your ability to be a parent.  If you are worried to death about your kid, than when they go into the real world, what are they gonna be like?  If they get offended by me saying god dammit, then maybe there is something wrong.  If they don't here the word pussy, or fuck, or shit.  Than when they see the real world, they won't last a day.  It's bullshit and it's proof of the pussification of the United States thanks to conservatives and yes even the liberals.  I respect what my country USED to be.  I love what my country USED to be.  I love what my goverment USED to be.  How do I feel about it now? It can sucks my cock for all I care.  No I'm not promoting terrorism.  I'm saying this country has lost what it was made for.  It lost most of the freedoms we should have.  It lost the integrity.  It has lost the intelligent people.  It has lost the toughness that even my generation had, because parents feel they need to protect their kids from everything. You think my music is the devil? Take a look at yourself.
RELIGION.
First of all, I'm not christian.  Second, I do know what christianity is, I went to a christian school for the first 5 years of my life.  This is the thing that's making our parents scared to let the kids get into trouble.  And to me it's pure bullshit.  And it should be stopped.

I'm gonna stop ranting now, and I will continue at a later date.
Dig within yourself and take the time to figure out what I just said."

"event","AAAHHH!!! I hate not having a license!! Trying to find a ride places sucks major ass.  So far the car I want is pretty much looking to be mine...I just don't know for how much.  I think I'm gonna put a Sony Xplod system into it.  So my car will be about $350 and my system will be upwards of $300.  Hm...I see something here...

I can't wait till tonight, I better get to see Jen or I'm gonna fuckin flip out.  This week was REALLY long.  It seems that all the weeks are running together.  :-(.  Quick poll of the day: why is it all day on Wednesday you think it's Thursday, but then on Thursday you're ok again?  I dont know, it's just one of the mysteries of life I guess.  I know it's cliche, but I made it up about 3 years before the shirt came out, so I still take credit for it, but: what if the hokie-pokie really is what it's all about?  Well then, I say put your right hand in the strangle the motherfuckers that piss you off.  :-).  I know I'm such a sweet guy.  Just ask any of the women that know me!  The guys are just jealous that I'm such a sweet guy and their pessimistic jerks who don't know the meaning of romanticism.  Then again, I can't think of the exact meaning at this exact moment...but who cares right?   We ALL know I'm just a sweet guy who loves the ladies.  Anywho, I'm gonna go shoppin on eBay for the stereo for the car that isn't yet mine! WOOHOO!!

See ya at the EHS game! Be there or be square! But wait...I thought it was hip to be square...hm...that's really weird..."

"event","Hello.  As you all know, yesterday was the one year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.  Before we go any further, if you are offended by me being really fucking pissed off, then leave...right now.

To start off, yes I did suffer a personal tragedy in the attacks, in a few ways.  I will not go into any of them.  That's it.  Next, I would like to say that I know that many people suffered on that day.  Tell me this, when did it become cool to exploit this?  Television stations have been talking about 9-11 since the day it happened.  Yesterday, they start patronizing the people that have relatives that died in the tragedy by replaying the footage, and talking about it all day.  I do agree that it should be a day of respect, but I don't agree that it should've been going on all year.  Enough is enough.  It fucking pisses me off that those stupid motherfucking dumbasses at the fucking tv stations decided to run the names over the goddamn screens all fucking day.  How come it's not alright to offend the conservatives at all, but it's all right for all the goddamn tv stations to offend me, and anyone else that lost someone in the tragedy?  I dont want to go on writing or I'm going to fucking be pissed all day.  I just needed to vent.  Poll of the day: why is the American media and the majority of the American public so fucking ignorant that they can't see all they're doing is pissing people off?

Get the fuck outta here."

"event","Well, I've discovered something.  Stone Sour fucking rocks!  For those of you who dont know, Stone Sour is Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylors', other band.  They fucking rock, and I recommend you get the CD NOW!  Anyways...
Anyone else have as many problems as I do when looking for a car?  This sucks, everytime I line up a vehicle something goes wrong with it! WTF??  It pisses me off.  
I just got a message from Lispy Loser saying that I get up way too early.  Well you see that's because, I'm not a FUCKING LAZY ASS DUMB SHIT! I don't get to see Jen till tomorrow :-(.  Poll of the day: Why does school, band and work have to interfere with our personal life?  Just in general.  I just need to scream.  I'm in a pretty good mood, I just have a lot of energy I have to release.  I'm still pissed at fucking Wagner.  Long story...
Anyway, I think I'm gonna go write, that'll release this built up tension I have.  GAAAHHHH!!!!!!  I'm gonna go eat breakfast.  GODDAMN SCHOOL!!!! I so fucking hate it.  Until next time, here's a point to ponder:  do you serve a purpose or purposely serve?"

"event","Well, here I am, as I stated yesterday - I'm back.  I think I pissed off Jen last night. :'(.  I won't go into how or why.  Anywho, I'm EXTREMELY bored.  Oh well, I get to see her tonight :).  I'm happy now.  Quick poll of the day: If true love is so true, then why are we afraid to admit it?  I don't know.  I don't have much to say, I have to go to school...boo to that.  Is it just me or is it pointless to go to school?  I mean I'm a rocker a.k.a. rock star.  This means I don't have to go to homosexual-school. I hate to be a downer, but I really wish someone would shoot up my school.  At least a few of the people...I really don't like stupid motherfuckers.  Ah well, waddya gonna do?
I miss Jen.  She's so cool.  Quick poll of the day #2: why is she with me?  I don't know, but I'm definatley thanking god for it.  Wait...I don't like god...so I'll thank...the Sun God.  There we go, I'm gonna be a Sun worshiper from now on.  So that means the word 'Sun' has to be capitalized from now on.  Hold on a second while I go back and fix it...Ok, they're capitalized now...wait a second...
I dunno
Another poll: Who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin...the book not the song? HA! Gotcha! We all know NOBODY HAS EVER READ the book.  The song just f'n rocks! Anywho... I'm ranting and being bored, so I'm gonna go think about Jen some more and hopefully she's thinking about me.

Hopefully she'll be thinkin about me!
Disturbed rocks! I mean um...yea.  I'm bored, that's why I'm writing here.  Oh well, who cares?  Ok, poll of the day:  Why am I tired?  I dont know.  Some rants: Mrs. Phelps is fucking annoying.  Mrs. Studyhallteacher is a fucking moron.  Schwank is cool, no complaints.  Mr. Erret is in serious need of a mental evaluation, and to think, he's my psych teacher.  I wonder if it's true what they say about most psychiatrists studying psychology because they, themselves have psychological problems?  Oh well.  Mrs. Scheid a.k.a. Hitler isn't too bad, but I dont have her for band, I have her for music appreciation, rock on!  Except I have to do report...but its on Metallica!  Mr. Wagner, needs to retire...10 years ago!  Mrs. Carlberg is on crack or LSD, or something along those lines.  She's really annoying.  Mr. Blair is f'n awesome, he knows nothing about computers! YES!  lol, I love messing with data.  We had to fill out these stupid surveys.  I'm Bill F. Clinton from Da Hood in Harlem, PA.  WOOHOO!!! Oh yea, I'm also an Asian, Indian, Jewish Quaker.  Anywho, theres my boredom for this morning.  Ah well, I feel a little better.  I can't figure out if it's the journal or Disturbed...oh well.  I'll just have to listen to it and write in this every freaking morning.  :( How sad am I?  Oh well, don't forget...don't deny me, and darlin don't be afraid."

He seems pretty supportive of us.  I hope he finds someone that will make him as happy as I am.  In my next entry I update in this messed up privacy-invasive journal, I'll write about let anyone know what my life is like."

"event","Dear Dad, 

    I never asked to be born.  You constantly berate me, subjugate my existence as though it was a personal choice of mine to be born and to be born to you.  I'm sorry to be the bane of your existence, even though I can't help that I remind you of my mother.  Why can't you understand that none of this is my fault?  Why do you blame an innocent infant for how miserable your life has become?  Where was my choice?  When did you or mama say okay look you can choose to never be, or you can be born and be hated by the very people responsible for your existence?  Oh right, NEVER.  So how come, before I was even born, I was the epitome of your hatred of the world?
    Papa, I know you got dealt a shitty hand in life.  It's not fair, and it sucks, but there's nothing you can do about it.  And making me hate _my_ life is not a way of dealing with it.  You complain about how fucked up your parents were, how your dad was abusive, how your mom died too young for you to really appreciate her as an adult...how do you think I relay my life to my friends?  Probably nearly identical as you do to yours.  You tell me you don't love me, that you tried but you just can't do it...I understand that, and accept it.  But why can't it be left at that?  Why do you have to keep nagging at me to make yourself feel better?  You are killing me slowly with your harsh words, just like your father did to you.  Why can't you learn from his mistakes?  How many lives have to be destroyed by this terrible cycle of torture before someone finally gets it right and just _loves_?
   Maybe the cycle ends here.  Honestly, papa, I don't see myself living long.  Between the health issues (the one thing you and I share, aside from stubborness and cruelty :) ) and the gnawing guilt that plagues my mind every day because of you, I don't think I'll ever live to be an adult.  Aside from trying to make yourself feel better, the other goal you have accomplished is to destroy my soul the way your parents destroyed yours.  Not an hour of a day goes by that I don't think about something you've done to me, or something you've done to humiliate me in front of our friends, or something you've done to make me feel like the most terrible, useless person on the face of the planet.  I look in the mirror and I see a failure.  Does that gratify you?  Please say it does, at least that would be something good to come out of this.  You have already taken away my spirit, any good that can come of me, any desire to have children for fear I will spread on our wretched genes, any possibility of happiness...let something good come of this.  Say that in either my emotional or corporal death, you will find pleasure.  And say it honestly.   Otherwise, then congratulations, you've raised more trash then you know how to throw away.  
   Every day, you make me wish I were dead; that I had never been born.  Every day, I have to cover up your mistakes with half-truths about who I am so that your dirty little secrets may be protected.  And I'm tired.  I want to give in, to give up.  I'm tired of life, it hurts too much, it's too agonizing.  The best thing you could have done for me would have been to smother my breath, hide my tears under a pillow until you couldn't hear the crying.  And don't pretend like the thought never crossed your mind.  Mama wrote about me that the first week she spent alone with me was one of the best memories of her life, being able to hold her child, practically alone, and just absorb the idea of it.  You didn't see me until it was too late...what she said is all I have to hold on to.  From the day I was born, I was worthless.  And I have you to thank for that.  
    For once, please have mercy.  Take me down with you so I don't have to suffer like this anymore.  It doesn't matter that you don't love me, just for once in your goddamn life have some human compassion.  If that concept is beyond you, I understand, but...if you hate me, let me go.  It's best for both of us.

Your daughter,
Amy"

"event","There have been so many voices in my life for as long as I can remember telling me what I should be, what I have to be, how I'm going to do it, etc., that's it's taken me until today to realize that I finally have the freedom to decide this all for myself without fear of hurting someone's feelings or ""getting in trouble"".  It's a relief and a burden at the same time.  The hardest part right now is drowning out what they gave me that was good advice, and what they gave me that was bad advice.  Rebelling against it _all_ and starting from scratch psychologically is obviously stupid, but I'm not quite sure how to weed out what's right and what's wrong.  One thing people in my family do that I think is fantastic was summed up best by my grandpa: ""Do a little bit of what you want to do, and a lot of what you have to do.  You hate the world most of the time, but at least you have fun for a minute or two of your life.""

Great philosophy, genuinely, but I just realized...I _don't know_ what I want to do, or what makes me happy...scary though.  Probably part of why I am so miserable right now."

"event","A sonnet my ex wrote for me awhile ago that I just came across in an old, old e-mail...very touching.

Dirge
 
When first encountered on a sleepy morn
This girl of depth and hair of vibrant red;
I did no know her life would end in scorn
Of life and of a future she would dread.
 
For for too long the darkness she had borne
Upon her guilty heart the Furies fed.
The harsh storms of life left her spirit worn,
She pined away; no want for drink or bread.
 
So now I am left helpless and forlorn,
For nothing that I wrote or that I said
Could help this lovely red haired girl who mourned
She was too afraid of the road ahead.
 
I can only pray that she has been led
By Hermes to the land of restful dead."

"event","Ugh.  I miss my old life so much it hurts, namely my old apartment in Felony Woods and all the things associated with it.  It hurts even more to realize that I can never get back all that I had (hint hint), and how lucky how I was.  Stupid, throwing it all away.  Nothing now is going to be good as good as it was, as least as perceived in my head, and nothing can numb the growing ache for things past in me.  Life sucks."

"event","I've been going through a strange, sudden, unexpected mentality change lately (starting about a week ago).  I'm not sure how long-lasting it's going to be, or if it's going to be a good thing or not though.  It started from thinking about The Ex (the few people who know me really well know who I'm talking about) after a conversation who I gave my number to at work.  He asked me if I had a boyfriend, I said no, I'm anti-relationships, and he wanted to know why.  I couldn't explain it to him--hell, I can barely explain it to myself--but it brought back memories.  And thinking about The Ex made me realized how much I _miss_ that amazing, blissful connection in a relationship where two people are so wholly intertwined and complementary of each other that it makes everything else in the world beautiful.  With The Friend Ex, we were soulmates (in the grand scheme of life, not in a romantic way, as we found out the hard way), and so we weren't genuinely meant to be _together_.  It took wayyy too long to realized that and fucked up the best friendship I could ever possibly dream of.  But The Ex...god, I miss the days of calling in sick to work so we could lay in the gross and stare at the sky, and have that be the highlight of the year.  I want to find that again, I'm sick of just fucking around without any kind of stability.  But I doubt I ever will be able to find that again.  I not only to find that again, I _need_ to.  I need to believe in love and passion again, something beyond my corporal existence.  I am so completely drained and miserable and depressed right now because that's all I've had in my life--tangible chaos--since June.  It's like I've completely lost touch with myself because I'm afraid of rediscovering what's inside me and what in other people makes me whole, then losing it again.  Whoever said it's better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all is a fucking moron.  I'd much rather never have known, not have realized what I was missing, then to be terrified and realize my life is pointless because I'll never find it again and I don't feel life is worth living without Him, or the idea of him.
    At least, I think I think that.  But I'm not sure how much I mean that it's better to not know.
   I have a feeling I'm going to be making a lot of major life decisions pretty soon.  All because of one phone conversation with Justin.  Oh, what a weird world.

The e-mail that makes me...think about stuff, I'm not sure quite what though:

>Amy Dearest,
>
><b>Adoration</b>

"event","Preface: the weirdest, most random crap seems to happen to me.  Especially when I'm shitfaced.  I like bugging people with stories of said random crap, so this is the easiest way to do it.  Enter weird occurrence number one.

I'm craving a peanut butter sandwich, so I go out to buy bread.  I'm walking along the street, there are a few people around, including a black crack addict behind me.  He's about 6'2, wearing a hat, kind of twitching and bouncing around as he walks, beatup brown coat, and was harassing people in front of Subway for quarters.  I'm fucking clumsy as shit, so of course I drop my wallet and all my change spills out (lucky me).  I lean to go pick it up, and black crack addict nearly has a heart attack.

Black crack addict: ""OH MAN THAT SHO IS A LOT OF CHANGE!  I COULD SHO USE ME SOME CHANGE LIKE THAT, YOU GONNA GIVE ME SOME OF THAT CHANGE?  I COULD SHO USE SOME OF THAT CHANGE!""
Me: ""No, I'm sorry, I'm really broke and I need this to go get food.""
Black crack addict: ""BUT THAT SHOOO IS A LOT OF CHANGE!  I KNOW YOU AIN'T NEEDING ALL THAT CHANGE!  YOU GONNA GIVE ME SOME OF THAT CHANGE?""
Me: *still picking stuff up* ""Uhhh...you can have this penny?""
BCA: ""PSH NO THAT AINT GOOD, I BE NEEDING LOTS OF CHANGE!""

I finally get all of my change picked up, thankfully, and begin walking as fast as possible towards the store.  Black crack addict is _still_ following me, although at a much lower pace because in his drug-induced haze he probably thought the sidewalk would move him itself.  Destination reached, I'm at the store.  I go in, get my food, walk out.  Black crack addict is STILL THERE!

Druggie: ""DID YOU GET MO' CHANGE FROM THAT STORE?  I'M BETTING YOU GOT MORE CHANGE!""
Me: ""No, I didn't.""
Druggie: ""I KNOW YOU GOT YOU SOME CHANGE!""

Now this crosses the line.  Fine, you're on drugs and have wasted your life and are fucking broke.  Not my goddamnit problem, if you really think I want to feed your obvious habit, you have got to be shitting me.  So I lose it with him.

Me: ""LOOK.  I fucking told you that I'm not going to give you any goddamn change, are you too stupid or too doped up to get that?  I'm sure there are plenty other of suckers to fucking give you something, but it's not me.  I might give you some goddamn bread crust if it's actually something legitimate you need, but I somehow really doubt that, so leave me the FUCK alone.""
Druggie: ""BUT I NEEEEEDD SOME CHAAAANGEE!""
That's it.
Me: *raises middle finger* ""SMOKE THIS, YOU FREAK!*

Then I literally ran off.  I heard a guy giving him some money though, so hopefully he'll have enough to score his hit and overdose so no one has to deal with his pathetic ass anymore."

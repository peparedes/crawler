boston this weekend. (yes diana, im going to be in boston. call me?)

bennington next weekend. (halloween at Swan house? yes indeed. i believe a certain someone will be recieving a good amount of tala time. and no emma, i dont mean you.)       (JUST KIDDING)

ah...the convienience of being so close to so many cities. Time is passing by fast. maybe because im having so much fun? possibly. 

i love my roommate, we're perfect for eachother. over the weekend we went to trader joes, found a salvation army, went to a party, and studied for art history untill 1am on my bed with dannymo and max.

"event","im sick with death. i dont know whats wrong with me. today i did almost close to nothing. maybe cause i didnt sleep last night at all thanks to a mr. max fartley (i mean hartly) who kept me up untill 6am. i think i got sick from running around in the rain last night with many great boys while finding our way to a uarts brew crew party (that plus the no sleep part). 

i neglected to inform the livejournal world about my wonderful trip up to Bennington VT to visit emma. i went up last weekend, and had the best time of my life. heres just a glimse: friday night consisted of- Ponies in the Surf and The Wrens, a ""dressed to get laid"" party ( i didnt dress to get laid, i dressed to dance my ass off, and thats exactly what i did, with no regrets, how absolutely refreshing.) and an encounter with a wonderful human being named Ryan (he had his bed in his closet and wants to go the university of edinburugh next year.) Sat.- a bad dance preformance, some good bonding time with emma, swiming in a freezing cold pond (or at least laughing at the kids who actually did swim), great food, meeting my newest love-of-my-life named Alex (shes from minasota), another party that emma and i escaped from just in time (security came 5 min. after we left...), and sunday was spent doing some work on the lawn, talking to gavin, changing my trian reservations (cause i never wanted to leave) and more bonding time. sunday i went to classes with emma and had a pre-interview with admissions. 

i want to go back...

i want to get better...

i want to see your pretty face again...

im working right up untill i leave on friday for Phili. i have only thursday to pack...its going to be insane...but im only able to focus on one thing....
the newest member to add itself to my life equation: a meeting set for tuesday with gavin. he finally responded to my e mails with the nicest thing siad to me just about all summer. it was what ive been waiting to hear for a long time...""i want to be friends..."" thank god you still care. i hope we can resolve some things, or at least leave everything on a hopeful and happy note. that way, next year when no one even compares to him, i wont feel so foolish like i have all summer. its funny that even after so long with no communication and hardly any interactions between us, that i can still have such strong feelings for him. we shall see... 

also on the topic of people i care about...

Ukie sent me two letters and has called me a few times. i love hearing from him. i honestly think hes going to be one of those people i will stay friends with for the rest of my life, even if we see eachother only once every 5 years...we connected in a way that i cant explain. there was no sexual anything between us, and yet it was like we had known eachoter for years, and we could tell eachother everything.

i woke up and wished for rain and low and behold we got hit with a hurricane that sent trees and tee-shirts flying. we ate dinner at Jackies, and watched my brother make french fries. it was delightful, especially since my meal was interrupted by a call from gavin to wish me a happy birthday. it made me smile for the rest of the night. because of the storm no one had power besides us. Brian and Anthony wanted to take me to a strip club, but the ones near us were all 21 and over, so that plan fell through, thank god...so i crashed at Charlie Woo's and had a blast with pearls and melted ice cream in the dark. my parents got me a trunk full of pillows and blankets for next year. and i got lots of hugs from friends. soo far those are the best gifts yet. now im waiting for Audrey and Mat to get here so we can hit the road again and go to Whole Foods for picnic supplies.

""The title of BEST SHOW EVER has been given to Of Montreal sunday april 10 at the unitarian church of philidalphia! Congradulations! Starting with our award for cutest duo soft indie half norwegian band goes to Saint Thomas! These two boys played some of the most adorable music i've heard in a while breaking between songs so that we could admire the guitarists attractive norwegian accent only to start up again into catchy beats provided by the precusionist (super indie Mark Van Der Lee) who taped away at his tamborine lifting his left leg the whole time and hiding egg shakers from his confused counterpart. The follow up was a band by the name of Dr.Dog who get the title of Craziest Funky Indie Rock band. Out of control they careened across stage with pop punk jumps added tastefully and old school sunglasses for pursonality. The lead singer was particularly charming (and out of his mind) he was somewhat reminicent of Ducky from ""Pretty in Pink"" which will always get me personally on my knees with admiration. The forth band was so loud it provided the perfect excuse to go outside for some air. The amount of carbon dioxide floating around the low ceilinged unventilated basement was enough to make anyone faint. Our places pushed against the stage were well worth any trouble when the headlining band started their performance. Of Montreal is awarded with Best Live Band Performance Ever for their witty antics, bizarre stage presence, and brilliance at their instruments. Almost beyond description, they started a strange monotone drone while still offstage and they entered with exagerated slow motion, stage fighting in slow motion and offering amusing facial expressions in slow motion. They begain their set amazing and finished amazing. Throughout making one song flow to the next while still offering distiction between the two. THey would go to the side wings ever four or so songs leaving the drummer/bassist/trumpet man playing a solo and change costumes. The lead singer was to say the least eye candy and him shaking his booty to his own songs in a green rainjacket and blue fuzzy cap was like a whole candy factory. After the cheering and clapping of the encore they returned to play Supergrass ""We are Young, we are free..."" you know the tune on the clueless soundtrack. I can't speak for everyone but by then i was in exstacy. They played around some more with guitar riffs from the Shins, ACDC and a few i didnt know but ended with two more songs from their new CD both of which were perfect.

 yesterday was great though. i wish it could be earth day everyday. i planted tons of strawberry plants in the community garden with the help of my new best friend, a two year old. and, i found a complete deer skeleton on the side of norwood road, and gave the skull to poop-head. (speaking of which, i saw the most insane turtle on norwood today after the lacrosse game, it was HUGE. I was so scared it was going to crawl out into the road, but i watched as it turned around and went back into the bushes. Ive never seen a turtle that big. it was easily two feet wide.)

 im teaching pilates during dance for the next few weeks...so at least im doing something athletic to work off all the cookies i eat.
prom is soon, and i dont have a date, or a ticket, and i havent started making that damn dress either. 
im going to Eee-ta-lee this summer. here i come Amalfie Coast.
theres a frenchie coming here for two weeks, staying with the Zarkers. 
senior independent study night is coming up at the end of May, so im dancing a lot in preparation for that.

but most important of all.........
the morehouses are moving...and it makes me cry. i dont know what im going to do if emma goes so far away.

Of Montreal in Phili was sooo great. they are such a talented, funny, nice group of people. we got to talk to them after the show, and they all singed my bag. 
emma, mat, lillie, gwyn, diana, and i. all drove up (actually I drove) and spent the day on south street. i bought a very cool dress that i took in and fits me quite nicely. 
At the show i had my moms digital camera, and took tons of pictures which all turned out fantastic. i have to make CD's of all the pictures for everyone, including a few people from the show who i made friends with. 
im so excited about phili for next year now, too. supposedly, the church the show was at has concerts all the time, and good ones too. Its really close to Uarts, and its going to be my favorite place. Also, theres this amazing falafel place on south street that stays open till 3am on weekends...yumm.


all in all, its good. im a volunteer for the auction this friday...dance is over, but operetta is just starting, and im busy with those costumes. 

poopface came back from cali, and we talked for the first time in about 2 weeks today.

speaking of which, i did a lot of work today, and i think im going to try and sell a lot of it. I NEED MONEY. hense the job i am currently applying for at Whole Foods. oh, who am i kidding, im not doing it for the money, im doing it for the FREE TAQUITOS!!!

so...my parents informed me that the lovely miss sarah O'D happens to be applying to almost all the same colleges as me. 
i ask: a coincidence, or the work of the devil? you chose. (they saw Bonnie and started talking, if you were wondering how they found out about this information). its ok though, im sure ill be able to use my wonderfull indie avoidence skills to go another 4 years without demanding an explination/apology from her. 
its really strange looking at all the photos an the binder rayla made for me for france. i feel like its not even me in the picture. 
what horrible lies.

so. SSFS dance concert had its own strike of disaster this past weekend. 
rayla with a broken butt, and emma and sarah s. in a car accident (divine intervention prevented any real harm, thank goodness)

"event","she was tiny the first time i saw her...all curled up with alex and a few other mixed in kittens. i chose the two. i named them both. they were mine, and i loved them so much
i used to play with the two for hours in my room...we'd sit in a circle, camille, emma and i, our feet all touching, and the cats in the center. theyed wobble and bounce around, and somehow that was enough
alex was buddah cat. he would sit with his back legs spread out infront of him and his front paws hanging down in-between. you could pick him up in this position, and hold him in one hand, sometimes he'd even sleep like that. cleo from the beginning was the queen, and later when the alex look-alike was added to the house, she quickly showed that she was in charge, and fat cat (who wasnt actually fat at this point) was left to follow her royal queens footsteps.
when alex died it had been a few months...i dont remember exactly, maybe it was even close to a year...
Cleo had multiple operations, multiple close calls, and lost at least 8 of her 9 lives. 
she died last week, the same way alex did. thank god i wasnt the one who found her this time however...once was enough.

theres no way to explain what that cat meant to me...and its so strange to think that people can have such close relationships, and feel so strong for animals that we cant talk to, and could never really fully understand. maybe its because they are the ones who understand us so well that we can feel that way for them..."

i had to think about it for a long time, but i finally said... 
for those moments before i die, when its said that your life passes infront of you, i want to feel completly content knowing that i did all that i could with the short amount of time ive got. basically, i want to have no regrets. 
thats a pretty basic and somewhat over used answer to that question, and i didnt want to say it, but its really true....because with that one answer i included all the many things i want to do with my life"

i use them as escape routes, when i dont want to try and understand whats going on around me, the books come in handy. 
french kids make so much fucking noise. i am starting to long for silence, and to think of all the Meetings at school that i took for granted.

god damn it.
that fucking humming.
 why does she always have to be making noise?

why am i so irritable?

i took photos of the train tracks today. 
its actually very beautiful. everyday walking back from the bus stop i stop and look down the tracks. then theres the house to the left that makes my eyes watter with happiness. i love that house. the stones all falling apart, the shutters stained red with age. all it needs is a tree growing out of it.

well, back to french land."

theres always gonna be that ""counter"" culture, and more times than not, this becomes the main streem after a while of being 'underground'... right now the indie population of the world is growing. The shins are talked about every where (and damn right cause they're fucking amazing) modest mouse on the radio along with the postal service...and to my surprise Of montreal is played on the speakers in H&M. i must admit...theres a part of me that doesnt want the indieness to spread too far, for risk of loosing great bands to the pressures of MTV... but part of me thinks, wow, people are starting to actually like GOOD music...maybe the indie kids will kill of those britneys and boy bands, and they'll be a new queen of pop named cat power...
but then, that doesnt make much sence either, cause part of the indie idea is that not a lot of people know about these bands...well, at least didnt...so if they become popular, does that mean they'll still be indie?

i sure hope so..."

I want to see garden state again. only this time on my couch with ice cream and gavin.

I miss good movies, 
i.e. you know which ones.

i had a different picture of france in my mind when i arrived, and i was utterly disappointed. it was Amelie's paris i wished for....and was left wandering the streets of piss ville.

i havent slept well in a week. when i finally manage to fall asleep nightmares cause me to wake up every hour crying. this morning i woke up with cleo's dead body in my arms, sobbing.

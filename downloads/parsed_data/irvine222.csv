My days have sucked.

Time for a manson quote/entire song.

(Quote/Song)
Dear God, do you wanna tear the knuckles down and hold yourself? 
Dear God, can you climb off that tree and meet in the shape of a ""T""? 
Dear God, the paper says you were the king in the black limosine 
Dear John and all the king's men can put your head together again 

Before the bullets 
Before the flies 
Before authorities take out my eyes 

The only smiling are your dolls that I've made 
But you are plastic, and so are your brains 

Dear God, your sky is as blue as a gunshot wound 
Dear God, if you were alive, you know we'd kill you... 

Before the bullets 
Before the flies 
Before authorities take out my eyes 

The only smiling are your dolls that I've made 
But you are plastic, and so are your brains...

A blog to commemorate the gods.
The gods of my town.
When i post this entry, you will think im full of it.  And that other people were better than us...and you can thnk what you want.  Lasts ummer a group was formed, a group called the Chemical Union.  A pained group, and a troubled bunch.  Last summer we owned medina.  Constantly walking the streets and never backing down from a fight, even when the odds are seven to three.  As it always turns out, the seven backed down.  Last summer the old form of the chemical union intook more drugs then we like to speak of.  The old form being Nikki, Steve, Josh, and myself.  Since then we have been threw some hard times, steve and josh were fighting, nikki wasnt even communicating anymore, and it was time to oust her.  Later after I moved there were three of us, all located in different towns. Noone knew later, that none other than dan flatt would fill the empty fourth spot.  Since flattacular has joined the cu i have had some of the best times in my life, that i would neevr trade for anything.  Just recently the news came that Josh was moving, to north carolina.  This is just another challenge we have to face.  One thing i always want you guys to know, is that you are brothers to me, and i will always be there for oyu, untill we are buried on the same grounds.  I miss you guys an unbelievable amount.  I know nothing will come between us, and I know the legends of some of the crazy shit we did will never die.  Because we are the mighty Chemical Union.

(Quote)
Me:I got man, I got it
Steve:what do you got?
Josh:Whats going on?
Me:Look we can write it backwords, switch some of the letters to
Steve:And make one or two lower case
Josh:The E, should be backwords...
Me:Yeah the chemical union, in code
Steve and Josh:Yeah!

Fucking bored as shit and i am desperatly awaiting my lover(steve) to call me.  I am also waiting for my other lover(Colleen) to get home so I can call her because I miss her.  You know what else i miss, the carefree days during the summer of '04 walking around medina, smokin' or drinkin', you know just chillen hanging with my best friends in the world.  You know those days.  I wont ever forget that summer, all the days with josh and steve.  I really will miss it this summer.  I mean look at whats happening to us, Josh, moving to one of the carolinas, steve, out in albany, im here, In red creek, and Flatt is still at home representing medina.  I just dont know what to think right now.  I feel very homesick and I really do miss everyone.

Thats all everyone, peace out....

Wow I miss Flatt and Blount and Steve and Josh and everybody.  .....Wow so much fun this summer.  *laughs to self* way to many memories.  So anyway, those of you reading this may be like ""Hey, havnt seen you in a couple months"" and thats well...because I moved.  And I'm quite happy I moved in fact.  But sometimes I miss all the old times, and just things would go back to how they were.  But here people like me, and I have a hott girlfriend.  More then I could say about Medina. Huh.  August 27th, my last full day in Medina.  Had an awsome going away party, and a killer hangover the next day.  Cant wait till this summer.  As long as none of you have forgotten....

  Any way the moral of the story is, change is good...but I love you guys back home, and I wont forget about you.  Just for the record...Im playing FFX.

Then we got on the net and looked at swords and shit....and watched some Strong Bad emails.

Then he played my FFIX game and did some of the chocobo side quest.  Flatt got home from work at like 8:30 called and bitched cuz Blount was over but he wasnt...so I told him to come down.  Flatt stayed till ten and blount stayed till 10:40.

Then i made these apple cannonball things for my family and i.

Saturday we were roofing my new house (me, Uncle Art, Bob Waters, and Shannon Hodgins).  That didnt go so bad.  But Shannon almost fell off the roof....and he was juts like ""Shit, almost fell"" then hopped back on the edge of the roof....crazy fucker.

Then Sunday we had a time limit, cuz we had to leave in time to see the Rush show.  We were putting up some shingles and i tripped on the house and almost slid off the roof.  It was fuckin crazy.

The Rush show was really good for the first half.  Then they fucking sucked hairy nuts the second half.  They played Red Barchetta which is my favorite song, and I got a t-shirt....so I'm happy.

2 weeks exactly.

Peace.....I'm out

You would think when someone lives somewhere for 6-7 years of their life they would have something to say about there stay here.  And yet I have nothing much to say.  Except thanks to all the people who have made my stay here worth while.  Theres a list of you, and I might just out a small thank you note before I move.  6 years and not a lot of memories, but the memories I do have are either very pleasant, or extremly depressing.

Well I broke my 7 day no FF string today.  Thank god.  Today was pretty boring with not a whole lot to speak of.

Talk about fun.  First we couldnt find the girls.  Then we called them to see where the were, so they said they would stand on the corner.  Blount blew right by them and had to go back and get them.  And then we found out there were three of them instead of 2 and there was no room in the backseat.  Then when we dropped them off we got completly lost for 15 minutes or so.  LOL it kicked ass.

Yeah today (Thurs) Flatt and Josh were over today.  We tried installing DoomIII onto this bitch.  It was bust :(  So then Flatt ran home and grabbed Halo and kicked the shit out of us, it was horrible.  Somewhere in between this whole mess of events i finished Disc 3 of FFIX.  I'm practically done with that game now.  It seems like it took no time at all.  I have to go to my new house today/tommorow, cuz its like thursday for me but its really friday.  So FRIDAY I have to go to the new house, I have to get up at like 8-9....SHITTY!

OK I'm done.....Peace

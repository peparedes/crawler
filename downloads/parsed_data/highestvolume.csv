"event","i remember the first days, weeks. how new & exciting it was. everyday was like the first. neither of us had a job which pushed on our visitation addiction. i can still remember the feeling so well like it was only a few hours ago.

i'd get up & hurry to look my best. every hair in the right place. every article of clothing i had hoped you would like. before we had cars, i was so thankful i lived right on the trolley line. that meant it'd be less time to get to you. trolley, to the bus stop, to your street. i was anxious the whole time, i could barely calm myself enough to think of the things i needed to. 

it's funny how the feelings cloud the mind to the point where you can hardly function properly.

the two block walk to your house felt like forever wandering in the desert. my stomach would knot up so much it'd hurt. i wanted to purge my insides...but in the good way. all we did was hang out at your house or mine & it was honestly all i needed. compared to the way things are now, that's all i would accept.

i miss my old room for only one reason. all my comfort & happiness rested inside of it. & still to this day. my absolute most adored thing i did with you was to lay on my bed in the summer's sun, listening to soft music, with our feet resting on the window sill. taking a nap or just talking. sitting in silence with me nested in your arms, my face buried in your chest.

god, i miss that like they do in films. i'd go through all the heartache again, if everyday could be like that. repeated. day in, day out."

"event","we've changed. we've gone downhill. we're horrible & there's nothing we can do to change that. today you said we could, but look how many times we've said that. & look where it has gotten us. those were words uttered at a stronger period with us. right now we're the weakest links possible.

i grow more frustrated everyday & push you farther away. now i am the one with the chip on my shoulder. i am always unhappy about something & in the process, making the new happy you, miserable. it's making me sick to my gut thinking how petty & detached i've become. i don't know who or what created this. maybe it's all the bitterness because <i>they</i> get your free time. the time you're awake & having fun. being how you should really be. but you only seem to enjoy time with them. or anyone but me. 

& what wonderful time do i get with you? i get the 15 minutes before one of us has to sleep & the 15 minutes before one of us has to work. the times where all i have is your heavy breathing in my ear. that's just not cutting it for me. you've changed into this new person who goes out & does the things you used to talk down on. well good for you, but i don't understand. some of them even disappoint or disturb me. but that's your life.

i think it would be best for you if we didn't speak for awhile. honestly, no ploy to make you feel guilty or scolded. go have your fun being the new you. & i won't be there to trip your coat tails. it would be the best for you, & ultimately for me, because for once, i'm the one making us both unhappy."

"event","i've always had a horrible self image. & i don't know where it came from. i've always had positive parents & family. always making sure i knew i was turning out okay. constantly praised & told how beautiful i was. standing behind me 100% with whatever i've done. i never understood why i didn't believe it. i'm sure i did when i was little. i wasn't so introverted then. well, somewhat; i still never liked people looking at me. 

i'm still told how beautiful i am by my family. but it's different. sure, they could be brutally honest. but that isn't a family's job. they sugar coat almost everything. & i am sure i am beautiful to them, by their own standards. that i have grown to be a decent person, doing no bad, a hard worker.

maybe it was hanging out with a bunch of attractive people & always being just everyone's friend. i was always shot down by someone for my much cuter & thinner friends. don't get me wrong, i agree they were & i was happy for them, but of course i was still jealous. it gets to be old & breaks you down. until you start to believe no one will ever love you. i hate to say it, it's too cliche. but that's all i ever thought about.

i get angry when people think i'm an attention getter, because it was never about that. i don't feed off of compliments like a vain leech. i honestly don't even believe people 99% of the time. it was much deeper than that. i didn't care whether people knew or not, in fact, i wanted to hide it. i always have. it's nothing ""cool"" to think about yourself. to constantly look in the mirror & be disgusted by what & who you saw. to be brought to tears when your eyes make contact with your own figure. eyes & throat burning on the brink of a breakdown.

but this is only with myself, never concerning anyone else. it's almost as if i am blind to the rest of the world. as if i see imperfection as perfect in everyone else except myself. people much bigger than myself, i don't even notice. i envy anyone who is at least comfortable & happy with themselves, regardless of how they are outside or in. when i was younger, i never wished for love or a million dollars, i wished only to be completely happy with myself. to feel at home in my own skin, not like i'm living in a rental.

& i think that's why i almost fear being without geoff. he was the first person to make me feel okay with myself. he always doted on me about how perfect i was. in fact, he'd be disappointed if i had gotten any smaller. i don't quite understand where the attraction is. he & i have close to zilch in common, therefore it couldn't be that. i have less of a problem with my face than my body. but that does not sustain an almost 2 year relationship. or maybe it did with ours. we lived in a world where we didn't have much except an equal fondness for being in one's presence. his being sexual & mine hoping for romance in a new best friend. neither getting what we really asked for. but that's aside the point...

the point was, i'm afraid no one will love me the way he did. that no one will find me as attractive & actually want to get to know me. not to be used. because through all the fights & problems, the truth is we loved each other. really loved each other, completely accepting & loving the way the other looked. i was lucky to find someone like that. there's possibly a small handful of people that could do the same, but i'm so shy & introverted now, i'd be nothing but a bore. i've grown into this...thing...that is scared to go out. always worried people are looking at her with distaste or a laughing eye. i've built up this wall that no one can get through.

i live in a superficial world. not just the world, not just society, the people living in close vicinity to me. sadly, people i find attractive, much to my dislike, would be much petty. they want the waif thing that dresses like a star, dances like a goddess, drinks like a lush, & loves like a sin. all of which i am none. everyone wants this new style. to look mannequin chic before you even step one foot out the door. for some, it's natural. for others, it just looks so. but most end up pulling it off with no loss of breath. & i'm hyperventilating before i even leave.

i'm convinced i can live in my own world. enjoy my own company & perhaps one day step out of my shell. live the night life again. but it's hard enough to believe that on your own, let alone without someone to stand behind you.

i just want to be who i was before i met you, i was much happier & carefree then. i almost liked who i was."

"event","I'm sitting here, drinking my tea, looking out my window over Hogsmeade.  By all apperances, it's a normal, beautiful autumn day.  There are children playing, people bustling around to the different stores, their heavy robes pulled tightly around them against the wind.  

I see the child who's form I used in the skirmish.  She's going about her business, like the other orphans, playing while she can, even though she's been through so much in her short life.  I see her laughing, and think if I didn't have the charms up, I could probably hear it all the way up here.  I chuckle a bit, remembering when life was so simple, so pure, even a butterfly could make me smile.  Of course, it was when I captured the butterfly, bending it to my will, slowly depriving it of companionship and food and water.  It was so empowering to have such control.  

""Speaking of control..."" I stand, drinking the last of my tea, and stretch.  I look over to where there is now whimpering in the corner.  I approach the figure who is bound and naked, using my bare foot to raise the chin.  ""Yes, let's see how much control you will give me."""

"event","For the up-teenth time I'm so glad that I have moved out on my own.  I stir the potion that I've been working on for 21 days now.  All I need now is a bit of hair of the person I want to become.  I place the potion in a stasis spell, so that it will be ready whenever I need it.  I've become increasingly cautious, which I think will help with my extracurricular activities.  Especially when I apply to Auror training.  

I smile to myself at the thought of getting ""professional"" training in torture.  I'll be applying soon.  I just figure I'll wait for a bit since the election has just recently passed.  

I'm feeling a bit distracted, so I make a to-do list to organize:

1) Find specimen's for polyjuice potion.
2) Owl Emmaline re: she never owled me back.
3) Owl Theodore re: Auror training and entertainment.
4) Visit Hogwarts to make contact with old friends.

I take care of the owls first, then decide to take a walk.  That's certainly the easiest way to contact people.  Maybe I'll even take a stroll over to Hogwarts, one can never have too many ""friends""."

"event","I flop onto my new couch, relaxing at last.  My entire day has been spent running around with my sisters and Mum and Dad.  We started out early, moving all of my exsisting furniture and clothing to my new place, but Mum was appalled that I was going to live with just a folding table for guests.  So instead she took me to the enchanted furniture store and we got a couch and recliner, both of which are enchanted to transform into sleeping accomodations, as well as a pretty table and four chairs.  She also was determined to get me little things like an additional closet and bookshelves, I managed to keep her from purchasing the flowery draperies though.  I think it made her feel useful to be able to something other than be drowned in grief.  

I'm just glad to be out of that house.  There's only so much a girl can take before she starts pulling peoples hair out.  And it's much easier to exercise my ""interests"" when I'm not in someone elses home.  

I stretch out on my couch, having a sense of accomplishment.  

""Home sweet home,"" I say before drifting off for a nap."

"event","I spent most of the day helping around Hogsmeade, fishing for a place that I could move into that wouldn't be completely inconvenient.  While the place is filled with Mugglelovers, I definitely see the advantage of living in such a central location.  I believe I'm starting to understand Daphne's inner workings, and I got the impression that she'd like to have me there to keep an eye on things.  The thought that she would trust me to do that makes me feel very happy.  

I finally spoke with Rosmerta and found that she had a mid-sized flat that she would be willing to rent to me.  It's nice sized, one bedroom, bath, living room, and a small kitchen, but there's not really much more that I need.  It was clean and she said that I could make any changes that I wanted to it, so I told her I'd take it.  

My father was quite unpleased when I went home to tell him that I was moving.  I guess he assumed that I'd either stay there or go back to Hogwarts.  I'm his favorite, though, so I eventually convinced him that it was the best thing for me.  He's even going to pay for it.  I guess grief can work in one's favor from time to time.  

I'll be moving tomorrow, Rosmerta said that I could just Apparate my stuff in and move it up as soon as I needed to.  I think the quicker I'm out of this house and on my own, the sooner I'll be able to breathe.  

I look around my room and pick up a piece of parchment to send Daphne the news, I hope she will be pleased.  Tomorrow will be a big day.  One that I'm quite looking forward to."

I stare at the walls, they are white, pristine, warm.  

I hate them.  

I pick up a half empty cup of tea and throw it at the wall, shattering the mug, slopping the stale tea over the white wall.  It makes a satisfying crash and color.  I decide it's time for a change.  I pick up my wand, pointing it at the white walls, I envision the color of the blood of my first kill, thinking back to my magical theory I say, ""Mutatio Cruento"", which means to transform and stain with blood. I'm happy with the outcome, it's not the exact color, but it has an interesting texture to it.  It's much more interesting than the white anyway.  

I sit back on my bed, bored again.  I do hope to hear from Theodore or Daphne soon.  If not, I'm sure I can find something later to occupy my time."

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own skin.  

I feel like screaming.

I feel like running, flying, flaying, killing.

It's been two days since my kill.  It's been longer since I've heard from Daphne.  I want to tell her, I want to share this with <i>someone</i>, but I'm not stupid enough to owl her.  I do hope to hear from her soon, I know I need more instruction.  I <i>want</i> more instruction.  

I decide that I've been pent up for too long, so I grab my broom, opening my door to my small balcony, and jumping off.  I plummet toward the ground, it's good my room is on the top floor, I pull up as I reach the first floor.  I'm not a Seeker, I don't dare to go any closer, but I still get a bit of a rush from doing it anyway.

This is the other thing I was made for.  From the first time I put my hand on a broom when I was only seven years old, I've always been able to ride.  Daddy didn't think I'd be able to do it, he just let me try to appease me.  Imagine his surprise when his baby took off into the heavens.

I look at my no longer white dress pooled in the middle of my floor, remembering what fun I had after I left.  I can scarcely believe I was still standing after that much to drink, but it didn't stop me from going to find someone to relieve my frustrations on.  

I found myself wandering down a dark street surrounded by pubs in the rougher side of London, looking, searching, for that perfect plaything.  Since I was dressed so nicely, I attracted a lot of attention, so it was very easy to draw him out.  

I remember how he approached me, his eyes already undressing me, his hands groping places they shouldn't have.  I just gave him a little smirk, grabbed him by the hair, and drug him into the alley.  He watched me draw my wand and looked at me as if I were crazy.  I simply pointed at him and stated ""Silencio"".  He laughed at me, and then realized no sound came out.  It was quite a satisfying look he gave me.  I bound his hands and feet, I didn't want him to try to crawl away or to draw too much attention.  I'm sure if anyone saw us, they would just think we were shagging anyway.  I put my wand away, and looked around the alley.  I didn't come very prepared, I have to admit.  Luckily, there were several pieces of jagged metal and glass, it was a back alley after all.  

I concentrated on watching him scream, even though it couldn't be heard.  I tried to apply the skills that Daphne has taught me, trying to cut slowly, making sure he felt every millimetre of it.  He'd clearly been drinking as his blood flowed quite freely. It covered my hands very easily, pooling down around my knees as I straddled him, making a beautiful contrast to my white dress.  I know that I was too eager, and far too drunk, he barely lasted half an hour before he bled out.  I tried to keep him awake, but after a while, he just gave up.  No fun.  

I was a little disappointed, and then it hit me.  I just killed a man.  A Muggle, but I still took a life.  A grin covered my face and I look down at my blood covered body.  I released the bonds on him and Apparated back to my bedroom.  

I guess it wasn't such a waste after all."

"event","I wake today feeling blissfully sore about my nipples where Daphne had pinched them.  I can still taste her on my lips, smell her on my hands, and feel her on my skin.  Last night was fabulous, so much better than if I'd have gone to that ruddy bachelorette party.  I mean, I guess it was nice to be thought of even though I'm not in the castle, but really, what do I have in common with those people anymore?  

Speaking of invitations, I have to decide if I'll be going to the wedding this evening.  I've not decided yet, hoping that Daphne will make the decision for me.  By owling me, I mean, I don't expect her to instruct every aspect of my life, nor do I think she'd want to.  

I've successfully avoided my family for the last several days, but I can tell they are starting to wonder.  Adrienne left a note on my door last night while I was gone saying that she wanted to speak with me.  I sigh to myself and crawl out of bed, figuring I shouldn't put it off any longer.  I pull on a pair of shorts and a tank top and walk to her door, knocking.  I hear her call from behind the door, ""Come in.""  

I open the door and give her a little grin.  ""How's it going, Adri?  You left me a note.""

She's laying face down on her bed with her knees bent, legs crossed at the ankles, it looks like she's writing in a journal or something.  She closes the book and motions me over, holding out a newspaper.  I take it from her and see what she was looking at.  It's an article about the <i>thing</i> that killed Andrea escaping from prison without a trace.  I have to prevent myself from smiling, but I can tell it's upset her.  

I nod my head as I scan the article.  ""Looks like the Muggles have fucked up again,"" I say to her.  

""Ang, what are we going to do?  Now we can't even get justice or punishment or anything for Andrea.""  A tear slips down her cheek and she angrily brushes it away.  

I sit down on the bed beside her, placing a hand on her back, trying to soothe her.  When I don't say anything, she looks at me, turning over slightly.  ""I can't tell you how, but I promise you that I'll take care of it, okay?""  She looks at me, puzzled.  ""Look, you know that I've always kept my word, right?""  She nods.  ""Then you shouldn't worry about this.  I'll make sure it's taken care of.  If I have to, I'll track down who helped him escape and we can bring charges on them to.  You know I've got a lot of friends that are staying at Hogwarts,"" I have to choke back the bile at the thought of the school, ""and a lot of them have friends in the Ministry.  I'll take care of it, okay?""  

She gives me a look like she's not sure how to take what I've said, but after a moment, she nods.  ""I knew you would, that's why I wanted to show this to you.  I know you've been going out some at night, so I figured you hadn't heard.  Are you okay?  We've not really had a chance to talk since the day you got here.""

I nod my head and smile at her.  ""Yes, I'm fine.  I've been spending some time with a friend who's helping me learn to deal.  What about you?  You've not been just holed up here, have you?""

She shakes her head, ""I've been trying to hang out as well.  It's good to get out of the house sometimes.  I wish Mum would, but she's afraid to go back to London.  Hell, she won't even go to the market.  I can't really blame her, though.  She's making it pretty hard on Amelia and Amarice, though, she will hardly let them out of her sight.""  

""I bet.  Well, maybe we can all go to a film or something later?  Just a sister thing?""

She smiles a little, ""That sounds great.  Thanks.  I'll get them together, and we'll head out.""

I nod at her as I head back to my bedroom.  I decide to take a quick shower, disappointed to wash Daphne off of me, but I'm hoping that I'll get her back on me real quick.  I exit and change into a pair of low ride, flare leg, jeans and a leather halter, forgoing underclothes all together.  By the time I finish, my sisters are downstairs, ready to go as well.  I prepare a portkey in the shape of a Nimbus keychain to take us to one of the Muggle theatres in London, and we all grab ahold and leave.

"event","I finally lay back in my bed, too exhausted to move.  I have teased myself all day long, letting the blood dry on my body, my fingers almost clean from my wetness, but my hands still covered, half way up to my elbows.  I want it to stay there.  I don't want to clean it off, I don't want my hands to ever be without it again.  They feel so perfect, like I'm wearing smooth gloves.  I ignore the fact that as the blood has dried it's started to flake off, I'll have to see if there's something I can do to prevent that.  I know that I can't actually walk around with blood on me all the time, but a girl can wish.

I've kept my promise to Daphne, no matter how hard it's been, I have not come.  My body is buzzing from the lack of release, my hazel eyes almost green with desire, I feel light headed, but tense at the same time.  But, no matter how much I want it, I will not fail this simple task that she's given me.  

For once in my life I am free.  

For once in my life I am <i>me</i>.  

Which, I find to be ironic since my freedom comes in the form of her control over my actions.  But, if she will continue to teach me, I will follow her instructions completely.  

I wonder to myself how I've gone so long without shedding blood.  How have I made it to my twenty-second year of life without finally pleasuring myself.  I guess that's kind of it, though.  I was always worried about how things ""looked"", keeping up apperances and fuck all.  I was the ""big sister"", I had to set the example.  But, if I'm honest with myself, the gods know I've shed blood more than once, but it was either my own (I learned healing charms at quite a young age) or under the guise of Quidditch.  

Everyone knew that I was a ferocious player, I prided myself in it, but I don't think they knew how much pleasure I got out of hurting others.  It's probably a good thing I wasn't a Beater for that very reason, someone would have lost their head.  I smile to myself at that visual.  That doesn't seem like such a bad thing.  Well, I guess it would suck for them.  

I look at my forearms, wondering how many scars there would be there if not for magic.  Even my legs and breasts and stomach would be covered.  I relished not only the blood but the pain and the feel of a knife or blade or even a pair of scissors as they slid through my skin.  I completely understood what Daphne said about cutting too quickly, I made that mistake a lot when I was young.  Cutting too deeply or too quickly just blurred it all together, I couldn't distinguish the specific nerves that were screaming, the blood that was trickling, the flesh that was separating.  I discovered that it's much harder to gage the depth of a cut on someone else's flesh, I guess that's the delicate line between amatures and masters, or mistresses as the case may be.  I do hope to get the chance to practice again very very soon.  

I shiver again as I remember days long gone.  It got harder and harder to hide the longer I lived in the Gryffindor tower, so I mostly got out of the habit of it.  I guess that's probably when I got so much better at Quidditch.  I had to focus that energy somewhere.  For ""old times sake"", I reach underneath my mattress, feeling the small dagger I always kept there.  My mum asked me about it one time and I just told her that I felt better with it there.  She looked skeptical, but she didn't press it.  I look at the blade, it's old and scratched up a bit, but I've kept good care of it.  It's significantly smaller and lighter than the lovely dagger that I was able to use today.  

I hold it in my right hand, holding the hilt firmly as I start to cut the back of my left forearm.  I hiss as I make the first cut, feeling myself get wet again.  First stroke is a | then ) and @ and | then * next | and - and | then | and \ then | next ( and - lastly ~.  I look at my work and am pleased to see a rough sketching of the word ""Daphne"".  I hold my arm down, letting the blood flow down to my fingertips, rubbing it in like lotion.  I shall sleep like this tonight, feeling the sting each time I touch her name, the blood, both my own and the creatures, covering me.  

I can erase all trace of this come daylight when I put back on my ""big sister"" face and pretend to be who they think I am, but inside I shall be only biding my time until I hear from her again."

I was pleased that she seemed truly suprised at my little gift, I think that may have been the one thing that convinced her that I was real.  

Gods, I'd forgotten how fucking hot she is.  I guess in school I was always so caught up in Quidditch and school work and house rivalry that I never really took the chance to observe her.  I forgot how tiny she was too.  Gods, she's almost a foot shorter than me!  She looks so fragile, but by the gods, I know she's not.  She could probably break me in an instant.  The sad thing is, I just might let her.  

I've not thought of a girl like that in a long time, not since school when I had that doomed crush on Vicky Frobisher.  I shake my head at that thought, how could I have had a crush on someone that thought Charms was more important than Quidditch?  Of course, now I realise that in the real world, it is, but that's beside the point.  

I'm very anxious to hear from Daphne, I'm trying not to hope too hard that I hear from her today, I don't want to get my hopes up, and I want to at least <i>pretend</i> to be cool about it.  But, I feel as if my life is just starting.  That's ironic, huh?  My sister's death causes my rebirth.  

I stare out the window and think on that for a few minutes.

Just the idea of having a funeral for a 10 year old is what's disgusting.  They shouldn't make coffins that small.  Why not just put them in a normal sized one?  I almost threw up when I saw how small it was.

I hear a tentative knock on my bedroom door, and call for them to come in.  Whomever it is, I've got to face them at some point.  Holing myself up in my room won't change anything.  I'm a little surprised when I see that it's my sisters, remaining sisters I should say, Adrienne, Amelia, and Amarice, that walk through the door.  I would have thought that it was Mum or Daddy.  

They don't say anything, they just walk over to where I'm sitting on the bed, the three of them practically throwing themselves on me, enveloping me in a hug.  I wrap my arms around them as much as possible, holding them as they weep.  I feel like I should cry too, like it's some kind of obligation, but the tears just won't come.  After a few minutes, their weeping dissolves into sniffles, and they disengage themselves from my arms, one sitting on either side of me, the other on the floor in front.  

""I'm glad you're here Ang,"" Adrienne says, placing her hand on my leg. Nineteen is too young to have to deal with things like this.  

""Yeah, I was starting to think that you weren't going to get here in time for the service, it's tonight, you know,"" Amelia says, her eyes puffy from rubbing them.  She's only fifteen, she should be out with her friends, not spending time with her old fogey sister.  

""Mum hasn't stopped doing stuff since it happened, it's like she's afraid to slow down.  I thought it was a little soon to have it, but she wanted everything taken care of,"" Amarice says, her 12 year old eyes looking much older.  

""Of course I came guys.  I would never let you guys down.  You know I'm always here for all of you, right?"" I ask, looking each of them in the eye.  ""I'll do everything I can to make this right.""  I feel the anger flash up in me again, but I push it down, my sisters need me for now.  ""How is Mum?  I was surprised that she didn't give me a visit this morning.""  

They all just look at each other, their faces a mixture of sadness and worry.  

""She's not so good,"" Amelia says.

""She hasn't eaten or slept since it happened,"" Amarice replies.

""She either cries uncontrollably, or she's just completely blank.  It's like she's either turned on or off,"" Adrienne worries her bottom lip as she talks.  

I nod at them, trying to understand what they are saying.  It's like my emotions have been turned off.  Except for the anger.  I can feel it boiling deep inside my chest.  It lets me know that at least I'm not dead.  

""Well, I guess I should get dressed and head downstairs.  It sounds like there's a ton of people here already.""  They all nod in agreement.  ""I'm sure people we don't even know are here, or people that haven't been in contact with us for years, suddenly show up when something this fucked up happens.""  I shake my head to try to clear the angry fog there.  ""I'm sorry guys.  I'm just trying to sort everything out for myself.  Maybe a quick shower will help.""  

As I stand up, they do too, each giving me a quick, but tight, hug before leaving my room.  After they leave, I pull my clothes off from yesterday and grab a long bathrobe, wrapping it around me.  I make my way to the end of the hall and am glad to see the bathroom empty.  

I walk in, locking the door behind me, and slip out of the robe.  I turn on the water, a little warmer than I normally do, and step under it, letting the pressure beat against my skin.  The rhythmic pounding is almost relaxing.  Almost.  

After half an hour, I get out, toweling off and slipping back into my robe.  I make my way back down the hall, pausing as I come to Andrea's doorway.  I turn and look into it, it's exactly the same as I remember it.  Her bed is not made, there are a few coloring and activity books thrown to the side, the controller to her PS2 is strung across the floor.  

I enter the room, shutting the door behind me.  I notice her favorite stuffed animal, a purple hippo named Sneezy, peeking out from under the rumpled covers.  I walk over to him, careful not to slip on the items strewn across the floor.  I gently lift him out of the bed, holding him to my face and breathing deeply.  I feel a tear start to trail down my face, and I surprise myself that I don't knock it away.  I sit down on the floor, leaning my head over on her bed, hugging my knees and Sneezy to me closely, and just let the tears fall.  

I make no sound as I sit there, but I vow in my head that I'll do anything I can to make <i><b>them</b></i> suffer for what they did to her."

"event","After wandering around the castle and the grounds most of the day, I finally make my way to Headmistress McGonagall's office.  I think I've been kind of avoiding everything and everyone because if I didn't go home, Andrea wouldn't be dead.  I know, that's a totally fucked up way of thinking, but it makes sense to me somewhere.  

As I approach her office door, I'm not surprised when it doesn't open, I'd figure she'd be in bed by now.  I decide just to leave a note on her door and pull out my quill and a scrap of paper.  I hope she doesn't mind the wrinkles.  

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/blood_red_moon/172484.html""> Private Note to Minerva McGonagall</a>

I affix it to her door at eye level, take one last look around the hallway, and then Apparate myself and my things to my old room at home.  

I'm surprised that there aren't already people in the house, but it seems to be quiet for now.  I'm sure my parents will be aggrivated with me for not popping home sooner, but I'm old enough to worry about myself now.  

I lay down in my bed, not bothering with the covers or even to take off my shoes.  Morning will come too soon as it is."

"event","<P>I'm surprised to find myself awakened by an owl tapping on the window of my dorm, I didn't realise I'd ever actually fallen asleep. I let it in, recognizing my family owl, Fredrick. I pet his head and give him a treat, he greedily devours it as I pick up the letter that he's laid on my desk. I curl my leg under me, sitting down in the chair, recognizing my father's handwriting. </P><EM>
<P><BR>Dearest Angelina,<BR></P>
<P>I hope that this owl finds you well.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>I've sat here for the past half an hour to try to decide how to word the rest of this owl.&nbsp; There's no easy way to say it, so I'll just say it.&nbsp; Andrea has been in an accident.&nbsp; She and your mother were shopping in London when a car hopped the curb and hit her.&nbsp; Evidentally the man had been drinking.&nbsp; But no matter how much he's sorry, it doesn't fix what he's done.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>Please, Apparate home right away, family is popping in from all over, and I want to be able to spend some time with you and the girls before it gets insane.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>It occurs to me as I read back over what I've written so far that I've not even been able to even write that your sister was injured.&nbsp; Well, not really injured.&nbsp; Gods, I'm sorry to have to tell you this through an owl, but I don't want you to be misled.&nbsp; Andrea was killed.&nbsp; The Muggle paramedics did everything they could, and we finally got them away from her so we could take her to St. Mungo's, but there was nothing that could have been done.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P>I wish that I could have written you with better news.&nbsp; I hope that you will not delay in coming home, we need you as much as I know you need us at this point.&nbsp; I'll see you soon.<BR></P>
<P>Love, <BR>Daddy</EM><EM><BR></EM></P>
<P>I drop the letter as if it were poison.&nbsp; This can't be.&nbsp; </P>
<P>""THIS CAN'T BLOODY FUCKING BE!"" I scream at the letter, willing it to not be true.&nbsp; I glare at the letter, feeling a surge of energy pass through me, but I'm surprised when it catches fire on my desk.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I jump up, backing away from the fire, but it goes out as soon as it consumes the letter.&nbsp; Fredrick is just standing on the window sill looking at me.&nbsp; ""Go on boy, I don't have a reply right now.""&nbsp; He hoots at me and ducks out the window.</P>
<P>""I have to think.&nbsp; Think Angelina, think.""&nbsp; I pace around my room, trying, in vain, to make some sense of the letter I've just recieved from my father.&nbsp; I, almost subconsciously, start levitating all of my things into the trunk at the end of the bed.&nbsp; A part of me knows that I'll never come back here.&nbsp; </P>
<P>After all of my things are packed, I pad down to McGonagall's office with my trunk floating along behind me. I guess I should tell her the news.</P>"

"event","I realise I've been staring at the ceiling for at least 2 hours now.  I can't sleep.  I just have this <b><i>feeling</b></i>.  

I shake my head to clear it, I just get like this sometimes.  Thinking that things are going too good, so they have to get bad.  I know it's weird to think that during a war, there are so many things that are bad.  I just can't help but think how much worse it <i>could</i> be.  

The feeling won't go away, though, no matter how I try to push it back.  It's just a nagging, gnawing, creeping, clawing in the back of my head and throat and soul.  I don't know what it means.  I've never felt this way before.  I keep just trying to block it out in the hopes that the sunrise will bring better thoughts.  

The grounds are completely silent as I walk to the window and look out.  There's a light fog covering the ground, the moon is bright and clear.  I think briefly that Professer Lupin is probably having a sleepless night as well, but for a much different reason.  

I consider going down to the Common Room to curl up on the couch, maybe that would let me sleep better, but I decide that there is no reason to be foolish.  

After watching the fog dance across the ground for several minutes, I finally lay back down, willing myself to go to sleep.  

Everything always looks better in the morning..."

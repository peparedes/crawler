i felt this thing
an age it could be called.
death becomes a reality...

vitality is not a virtue
decay, not yet
holding your life.
feel it. its here

things start
things end
and the middle
somehow occurs

feast on bread 
savor every last drop of water
you are no longer a boy
nor a man

what? hair?
is it gone?
find that your bones
don't work the same

health, ""humph
it isn't real""
destruction comes
then you begin to pray

but its to late
...
good
it was only a dream.

!out of fear
you go to church
try to live right
but what if you were still dreaming?"

"event","From then on all would be lost
The hope they now had rested in the hands of the small
With no true control of their own life
Nothing had really changed.
What will they do now?
How were they to survive?
A desolate infinity 
A destruction of soul

Am I you?
Will I soon wake?
I
Restless 
Demanding 
All will soon be lost 
Yet I will not fear
O' how death once looked at me
With shining teeth God grabbed me
Pulling me
And away I flew
Happiness hit me
A bruise it left for sorrow
Yet it came back again
And the light
How bright it was
I could not tell thee

The eyes of the children opened
Blessing those who fear
Holy came back to me
So out I reach my hand
Helping those who helped me
And again it was
Blissfulness 

And they opened their eyes to see
Yet again

The sword of life closed on us
Closing the lid
The worms could not escape
And with one last breath 
I jumped
I fell...

We lived
Sight was not a gift
It was our 'curse'
Because they died
And we watched

But they still stared at us
Through our ""other life""

Closing the door 
You held my hand

I just stood there
Why should I live if they didn't?
Was it my right?

-It was yours-

So I closed my eyes
Dropped 
Fell
We awoke

Heaven was not what we thought,
It was more!
Life began
It ended not
For your hand still held mine!


I do believe 
All our life we thought of them
As our fault
But is it?

Just live and let it be
Hold my hand 
Step through the light 
Live forever
And fear no more

They are happy 
Worry for them not
Live for your self
You can do nothing more
Let your light shine down
Down upon them who feel
Lift up and inspire
Life is... 
It just is."

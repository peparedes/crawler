"event","Living gluten free is not always easy...but for my husband and four boys, it is always worth it.&nbsp; There are times when eating gluten may sound &#39;okay&#39; for a split second, we know that even a molecule of gluten is harmful.&nbsp; So, we do not bother with gluten at all, ever.

Sometimes it feels like I am a broken record about what our family does and does not eat.&nbsp; That was one good thing about my book that I coauthored, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Gluten-Free-Way-Guide-Cooking/dp/1434457192/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367117587&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=the+gluten+free+way+my+way"" target=""_blank"">The Gluten-Free Way:&nbsp; My Way</a>.&nbsp; It allowed me to put into words, on paper, what we eat and what we do not.&nbsp; It also allowed me to share some of my favorite recipes with others.

I do know that my husband&#39;s health is far better being off of the gluten.&nbsp; My two oldest boys are healthy off of the gluten.&nbsp; My two youngest boys have never had gluten on purpose.&nbsp; When they have gotten it by accident, we know right away.&nbsp; I am thankful that I figured out that gluten was the issue when my oldest was young.&nbsp; I would not want to go through the two years of my oldest with the next three boys.

I am continuing to work on my gluten free recipes.&nbsp; I love experimenting and figuring out new gluten free flour ratios to use in my baked goods recipes.

I love talking about living gluten free.&nbsp; Please send me a message or comment."

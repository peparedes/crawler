"event","OMG, it has happened! My computer came on and stayed on for more than 10 minutes! Anywho, a lot has happened involving a lot of people including my two friends who adopted a baby girl. Congrats! Everyone's gone except for Ian and I've been lonely. I still haven't found a job and in a few months all my bills are going to start rolling in, one already has, but whatever happens, happens. I have so much online stuff to catch up with still, and this stupid computer isn't making my life easier. My new favorite television show if 'The OC' and it coming on in a couple of minutes, so I have to go! Later Days!

In bad news, my stupid computer wouldn't startup for the last week which put me way behind in on-line stuff and a few personal things... I hate technology. I have so much to catch up on and my computer's still not fixed so I don't know when I'll get another chance. Later Days...."

"event","This morning I cut on Willa Ford's ""Bad"" and put on a mini-skirt and a tank top to go out. This is a first for me in a long time! I have this issue with my body, while the world is focused on straight I've always had curves! Don't get me wrong, I love my curves, but when the clothes are made for people who are flat and straight all around, they tend to fit the curvy people a bit too well! One of my problems is my butt, as in <b>I have one</b>! Before J-Lo, having a backside was considered a bad thing and I was shy about showing mine off! After J-Lo I no longer care, so on with the mini-skirt and off to the bus on my way to the post office. I'm glad to say the trip went well and for some reason I felt like a version of Ashanti! I feel good about this and I might just do it more often! Later Days....."

"event","Yes, I managed to get Billy Idol tix for September and I'm so excited! In the meantime I also found this cool store in Braintree called Build-A-Bear where you can literally build your own bear from stuffing to dressing! It was so much fun! I also went to see two action-packed fun-filled films:<i>Pirates of The Caribean</i> and <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentleman</i>. For this summer I suggest you screw the critics and see what looks interesting to you! Have you noticed how all the movies they said sucked was actually good?

The popular and quite handy thing that I've been noticing is an identification page for people who you write about. I'm working on that now and hope to have it finished this week. In other news my friend/ assumed boyfriend, Ian, left for home, Ireland, Friday. Since he's been gone, he's been calling me every other day! I thought he'd forget about me, but he hasn't. He's returning at the beginning of August, just in time for my birthday! When he returned he's deciding where he wants to stay, in Boston, New York City, Ireland, or someplace completely new! Aren't life changing decisions fun! Also, a friend from high school emailed me for the first time in 3 years! I'll probably take as long as she did to reply to the email! Ohhh, one more thing, I found a Coldplay shirt on sale wicked cheap!! :o) Later Days"

I have no money at the moment, so I ask my mom if I can use her credit card, ""Of course! Here you are"" Oh thank you Mom! Whaddayaknow, she doesn't have enough on her card! Of course, she forgot her little 4th of July shopping spree so I'm still without tickets! I'll probably have money by the end of the week, but by then the covered seats might be gone :o( Maybe I can borrow from someone and things will work out. I really hope they do b/c I really want to go! I have my fingers crossed!

I'm so excited about the show tomorrow, my only fear is that I'm going to have one of my sneezing fits during my performance. Why did I have to get a cold this week!?! My schedule is packed tomorrow! The show is at 1pm and I want tyo see 28 Days... and then I want to catch some of the events for the holiday and I w2ant to go shopping at Back Bay, not to mention all the stuff I want to do at home! I'm sure I'll figure a way to get it all done.

I had to explain the holiday to Ian and Jean-Pierre. Since Ian was getting snippy and fresh with me the last few days, I told him ""It's Independence Day, the day we won our freedom from the Brits... you know, the thing your country still has yet to do!"" Jean (pron. JO-HN) got a good laugh. Well, I should have lots to post tomorrow. Later Days...."

Not like anyone asked us, but apparently two of the neighbors decided that it's July 12th and they're going to block the street off obviously! This annoys me! What if I was planning n having a big party that day and those idiots have the street blocked off! Do people ever consider other people!?!

In other news, a person I used to help committed suicide about 2 days ago and now I feel like crap. Alas I guess I should be happy for her since she hated life, maybe she's better off now. The play is July 4th, tomorrow I'm seeing T3 and now I'm going to bed."

You know, like the ones you see on TV at the big house with the huge pool and all the rich snobby people who don't really know each other, but since everyone is rich, everything's cool! Okay so I and my friends shouldn't have fit in, but we did at least I did, I loved the whole thing. It wasn't so much the dazzle of it all, I just felt free and real! I haven't felt that way in a while. Obviously, this was Ian's doing, but honestly I kind of lost him somewhere within the first 15 minutes! It was basically me and my friends! It was so cool and best of all there was a band there playing that boring, crappy music, but they left as soon as nightfall came so my bandmates and I took the stage and started singing Ramones tunes! It was so AWESOME!!!! My first real pool party... hopefully there'll be many more!

Last night my mother's uncle called and offered me a job to work in one of his offices in LA. I've wanted to go to LA my whole life, but now I don't know, I don't think I'm ready. This is also the same guy I could've known as ""Daddy"". No, nothing perverted, he wanted to adopt me since my mom had me 2 days before her 15th birthday! But good 'ol Mom decided to keep me.

"event","I'm not sure whether to be excited or freaked out about this! On the one head it's exciting b/c I dreamed about a dead person I never knew, Glenn Quinn. This never happens except once with Kurt Cobain but he never spoke, he was just there for a few seconds. On the other hand it's freaky because... he's a dead guy I never knew!

Anywho here's what happened: <lj-cut text=""My GQ Dream""> it was kind of like an Angel episode, but without Angel and without Doyle. Glenn was actually Glenn and I was some form of a Cordelia (as in clothing and attitude wise), but I looked like me (just skinnier!). We were walking into a room with this funny looking lop-sided, wavy mirror sitting in the middle, other than that it looked like your average large well lit attic. We were talking about a demon (I think), a queen who had come from amongst a group of pipes. We were arguing and then Glenn went to the mirror and said ""what do you see?"" I replied, ""Nothing, a Queen coming through the pipes?"" He said ""No, you can't see it. There are flowers, lots of flowers and she's happy, you made her happy. Don't you see? You did this! Without you, it wouldn't be possible! The flowers are so beautiful!"" An somehow I saw one on the floor in front of him. I mean, I didn't see, see it, it was kind of see-thru and floaty and I looked at him and he was smiling, just gleaming with happiness... then I woke up!</lj-cut>

I have a whole other story about a pool party, but I'll post it tomorrow when I have more time!"

I won't be getting a job in my field anytime soon (Audio Production, lol!) and I want to go back to school for what was supposed to be my second major, website development, but how do I do that? I'm not sure if I'm ready for Grad school, is there another way I can get another degree? Can I get a Bachelor's degree in more than one field? I have no one to ask these questions to and I'm confused!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And now I just realized the frikkin' date and time is wrong on my computer so everywhere i posted, i posted yesterday at 1pm!

It's still hot yet something drove me to the cemetery where I stomped on Glenn's grave! Not because I was angry at him, but I was on my way hone from rehearsal with a nice soothing lemonade Coolatta in my had and somehow it slipped as soon as I got there. I was so angry I started STOMPING! It cost $4.20 which is a  big deal when you don't have anymore money! I only took about two sips and for some reason I felt the need to go back across the yard and the street and tell the Dunkin' Donuts employee my sob story... and what do you know, it worked! He gave me another one free and said ""try not to drop it this time!"" I was SO happy and I can't help but think Glenn had something to do with it ;D
</lj-cut>

I went to see The Hulk yesterday and forget what some critics are saying, It's one of the <b>BEST</B> movies I've seen, even better than I thought it would be. I'm sure I had something interesting to say, but I can't remember now.

Okay not too hot, but considering it's been feeling like Fall, it's nice to feel summer finally here, Unfortunately it looks like the rain will be back for the weekend so I guess I better enjoy the weekdays. Tomorrow I'm finally going to see the Hulk! I'm ultra-excited! Although it's going to be even hotter tomorrow, i'll survive thanks to Coolatta's and slurpees.

Today I cleaned up my room, not b/c I thought it was too messy, but because I needed room for my fan! After that I slept and then I woke to listen to a slew of samples and promos I neglected and realized one of my recently new Sony speakers aren't working anymore. It's totally my Mom's fault, she made me drop it and now I have to tell her since she bought them. She's going to scream and yell and tell me how useless and clumsy I am(!) and then I'm going to hate her again and my whole day will be ruined! Later on tonight when <B>I</B> calm down I plan to make a vanilla shake and have some Jiffy-Pop! Oh and yesterday I made my new <b> Colin Farrell </b> icon, I think it speaks for itself! Later Days.

Unfortunately it's raining today... hard! So I couldn't see The Hulk and my mom and I make movie dates so I have to wait until Wednesday, her day off! I'm sick of waiting!! I saw clip of my love Colin Farrell on this summer movie preview show that i missed a few weeks ago. They showed it again and this time I recorded it and glad that I did because first time around I only understood about 1 sentence he said. This is what I love about the *true* Irish, they talk so fast with their accents knowing that you, the dopey American, will stand there with a smile on your face asking them to repeat themselves half a billion times before you get it! I should know, I be around enough! :)

BTW, the next time I get in one of my moods, remind me what a ------- I'm being and how I need to get over myself! Don't give in to me feeling sorry for myself, trust me I get into it, you  feed it, and I can go on for days. Let's face it, I have it better than most people and need to stop being so selfish! In other news, I've decided I need a muse. I can't find my creativity and I need to get this script done and a few other projects I want to do. I mean today is a perfect day for these things since I'm stuck in, but nothing! Oh well, if anyone wants the job you're hired! Later Days...

"event","I am sitting in the presence of a miniature gnome. A simple little fact about me, I HATE GNOMES! I swear they're the scariest thing on this planet. Why do I have one? I don't know. Maybe I just like things that scare me. I've been so tired these past few... years? maybe months and I don't know why. Of course in the back of my mind I am thinking it's because I'm dying of some dreadful disease. I always thought this whenever I felt less than normal, times like now I think. The only problem is I don't remember what normal is so I guess I'm screwed! I have all these new people in my life now, but you know how you have these friends that were always there for the most important times in your life and then it dawns on you they're not there anymore. My new friends are great, but i really miss hte three people who I went through six years of high school with. Of course there were more than three, but they were the three main ones. They're all still together, they all know what's happening in each others lives! When I met them I was the outsider and now I'm the outsider again. I guess it's only fitting!

I planted my garden today, but I'm sure I did it all wrong! I guess you can call it a garden, two sunflowers and an attempt at white pumpkins. I hope I get something out of it. The play is going well and since I've been feeling a lot like Buffy did in that episode it's been pretty easy to get the right look. I still have yet to see The Hulk and since it's now pouring rain I probably won't make it out tomorrow.

Good things? Well, I've got the new Harry Potter book, my first Harry Potter book. I like the movies so i hope I enjoy the book... I know I'll enjoy the book! At least it gives me something to do since I losT my creativity. Oh yeah, good stuff here! I got the new Metallica CD and I honestly think I'm too  something to be typing here since I'm starting to r a m b l e so I'll just stop now

For others it comes continuously, in waves, one after another. For those who only get one-shot, they assume its unfair if they miss it. They think if I only had another chance. Well that's all good if you get to see one side of the coin before you see the other. In reality that doesn't happen for ""the wave people"". For the one shot person,once they miss or take that shot it's over. One time, that's all it takes. For us ""wave people"" we never get to see the other side and we usually continuously make the wrong choices and are forced to repeatedly suffer the different consequences. This is not a fun thing. You may end up in the same scenarios, but you never have time to the think, to relocate the event in the bowels of your mind, so you go and make the wrong choice again and so on. However, not all the ""wave people"" are so unlucky, some of us manage to always make the right choices. But for all of us the fact remains the same that changes are going to happen or have already happened and we will live with the consequences for the rest of our mortal and maybe immortal lives."

Let me reintroduce myself:""Hello, my name is Buffy Summers."" Yes, you heard me correctly, I just got a really good tan! No not really, but I did get the role of Buffy in a play I never seriously auditioned for. It's being put together by <lj user=markyd>, but the funny thing is he had absolutely nothing to do with me getting the part. I don't know where Mark is, I haven't heard from him lately. Anywho, he wasn't present during my auditions and he didn't even know I was auditioning, I didn't even use my real name. I went in for Tara on Wednesday, ""Walk[ed] through the Fire"" this morning and came out Buffy! The play is a non-profit (HEAR that Joss!) version of the musical episode of BtVS, ""Once More With Feeling"". I never thought this would happen, maybe I should try Hollywood next! ;o)

Apparently he's decided to try some of his tricks (he's a magician!) in the park to try and make some money. Ian was sleeping. He said he'd come by tonight. I'm starting to think he's a vampire. I'll explain that another time. I'm bored so I got around to thinking about my life and I became really scared. I feel like I'm unraveling and everything's spinning way too fast around me! I need time to stop, I need time for everything to stop so I can breath and everything will be OK. I wanted HIM to talk too, but of course he's gone. I feel lost and trapped.

"event","I couldn't post in my own journal yesterday yet I had no problem posting comments in others. Go Figure! Anywho I had a lot to say and this was it:


Jean-Pierre is in Boston! He's at my house! Who is he? He was someone's exchange student when I was in high school. We talked some and he asked for my phone number and addy so I gave it to him, after all he was going back to France and what were the odds of ever seeing him again. We just got him a hotel room a few hours ago!
<center><lj-cut text=""What's The Story Morning Glory""></center>
The funniest story happened. Apparently he was on my porch at around 6:30am this morning. My mom was getting ready to leave for work around 6:50am and she walks into my room and says, ""There's a small French man on the porch holding pastries that wants to see you"". I guess I thought I was dreaming since I have weird dreams like that (and wouldn't you anyway!). I get up at 7am do my stretching, take a shower, brush my teeth, yada, yada... and then head downstairs around 8:15am. I don't look out the windows and proceed to the kitchen to fix breakfast. I cut on the TV and go to the front door to look outside and be still my heart, what do I see!?! A little French man holding pastries sitting on my porch steps! At first I didn't recognize him, and then the whole scene with my mother replayed in my head as I opened the front door, still shielding the house with the storm door. He gets up and says:""I lost your phone number, sorry I not call"". I look at him like he's insane and he says the Academy, the exchange program, Jean-Pierre. Then I had to race back five years ago to Boston Latin Academy and the exchange program senior year. ""Oh! I am so sorry, it's been so long! How long were you here? Come In!"" He walks in and tries to explain that he's staying in America for a while and decided to stop by and say Hello. He bought pastries since his plane came in so early and he thought we could have breakfast together, ""Oh and your mom's very pretty!"" I had to laugh and I apologized again. He brought by <i>Profiteroles</i> and <i>Petits Monts Blancs</i> and before you ask, no, i didn't figure that out on my own! Anywho he's here and apparently he left France because of a broken heart. Well, boy do I have a story to tell him!</lj-cut>

It's so odd that all these people are suddenly popping up around me out of nowhere. And now this <a href=""http://www.robbiewilliams.com/"" target=""_blank""><b>Robbie Williams</b></a> song is making me cry! It's called <i>Nan's Song</i> about his grandmother who went to Heaven but still comes out to take care of him. I miss everyone who I lost dearly, those I knew or had some real connection to: Glenn O'Leary, Glenn Quinn, <a href=""http://www.joeyramone.com/"" target=""_blank"">Joey Ramone</a>, my father, those I lost on September 11th. And those who I only knew of who changed my life: Kurt Cobain(thank you!), Lady Diana, Dee Dee Ramone, Aaliyah, <a href=""http://www.michaelhutchence.com/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Hutchence</a>, <a href=""http://srd.yahoo.com/S=2766679/K=paula+yates/v=2/SID=w/l=WS1/R=6/H=0/*-http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,394722,00.html"" target=""_blank"">Paula Yates</a>... there's so many more I can't remember now so I'll just leave it there.

The new Radiohead CD, <b>Hail to the Thief</b>, is beyond words! It's the greatest thing! I am so proud of Thom and the boys.If you buy it I suggest the ""special edition"" version, but if you're an avid Radiohead fan (who isn't!?!) then you already know this! Congratulations on a terrific album!

I had a small part in designing this, but it is beautiful, it just looks like it should be in an Art museum instead of a graveyard! I think Glenn would like it! He loved Boston, but he also missed Ireland so now it's kind of like he has both. Thank you <lj user=""markyd"">, without you none of this would've been possible! I also planted an Iris (Glenn's mother's name)at the site since I always find my black roses missing!

I just checked the Pub and what do you know, an old friend stopped in. Haven't heard from her for a bit, but she stole my subject from my earlier post here! Glenn Quinn, it's a shame for you to put me through this. Instead of me thinking about one person the 3rd of every month, I have to think about two. Well, I miss you, lots of people miss you and Claudia's right, I keep seeing you laughing. I wish you were here, I wonder what you would've been up to now?

I'm having lunch with Ian and some friends tomorrow. My mom brought back my Animatrix DVD and I am getting <strong>drunk</strong> off of my new favorite soda, <i>Sprite Remix</i>!

<ul type=""disc"">
<li>always keep your drunk boy-toy close by, if you let him stray he will... nearly over bridge into your much beloved, dirty Charles River!
<li>always keep a bucket or something near by so your drunk boy-toy won't end up puking on your clothes... close one Ian
<li> work on your perfect smile! Remember that song ""It's A Small World After All""! Oh so true! Whadda you know, one of his friends from New York happens to be the boy you went to middle school with who made your life a living Hell each and every day!
<li> when boy-toy FINALLY settles down he's going to Thank you for all these things, but of course you won't hear it because you're too tired from keeping up with him all day, so he wraps his sweater around you and allows you to sleep on his stomach as an expression of gratitude.
</ul>

Anywho, I had a load of fun and from what I hear Colin Farrell has too hanging out at his favorite Strip Club, Scores, in NY! I was there once with a friend a few years ago and it was only b/c i was obsessed with Howard Stern so we went in and 5 minutes later walked out, just so we could say we were there! Now it also has a Colin connection! Aren't I lucky! The odd thing that happened was I got a comment on my Glenn Quinn site. Usually the only mail I get from there is concerning Glenn, but this time it was for me and someone on this whole ""girl-power"" trip telling me how she was so proud of what I was doing and how she's been a fan of the site since it's homestead days..., yada, yada... it was pretty neat! Did I just use ""neat""! Oh, my inner nerdiness is starting to come out, I better get going!

Oh one more thing, I watched Amelie again and realized something I've been denying to others since the film came out... OK, YOU'VE WON! We <b>do</b> have a lot in common! Later Days..."

OK, so is it some twist of fate that everyone I know have something in common with someone from Hollywood!? These are the questions one asks! I'm sure Colin Farrell's having a ""smashing"" time to say the least and I know Ian is since I spent most of the day with him and in about half an hour I'll be getting back to his party. I'm watching Colin in The Recruit at the moment while waiting for my car to arrive.

What else have I been up to? Well, I've fixed some problems with my computer! I was having a chat with an online buddy about it and an idea suddenly dawned on me. Maybe I was looking at the wrong source! Maybe the problem wasn't so much with Microsoft but with IBM. This got me searching for information, something I've become good at online due to 5 years of college, and I found some interesting info. Apparently a lot of people with my computer type have been having the same problem. There's supposed to be some kind of Recovery CD I can order that can fix everything, so I guess I'll be trying that next!

I'm also writing another script! Apparently Mr. ScriptWriter (you know who u are!) has some form of writer's block and requested my help after ""stealing"" some scripts I had written for a class. Yes, they were returned, but only on the condition that I help write this script, so being a girl of my word, I am! I'm still trying to decide my future, future as in tomorrow, having a bit of trouble just starting there and gosh does Colin look <B>YUMMY</B> if only that was me he was throwing on that bed! Oh, back to what I was talking about... what was I talking about!?! Does it really matter?

"event","The simple joy of making Jiffy-Pop popcorn with my mom! Can you believe she bought me a Pinhead and Sid Vicious figure along with a little Nemo flashlight! Today was almost perfect. Ian took me to breakfast again this morning. He's fishing around to find my tastes. He noticed me watching him today and asked what do I find so interesting about him? I answered ""your interest in me"". He replied that I have real trust issues, I agreed. So he said ""I like your company"", to which I laughed for some odd reason after a small pause, he then started laughing too. It was interesting, we're in this midst of people totally different from us (the country club again) and we're so showing we don't belong while having the time of our lives! He's still upset over his ex-girlfriend though. He showed me the wedding invitation. ""How do you hang with your best friend and your most loved ex-girlfriend, his wife?"" I replied ""get an even better wife!"" These are the types of conversations we have, playing games with each other, it's like we've made some code. I never thought I'd still be talking to him now when I first met him.

Can you believe idiots are still booing the Dixie Chicks! And this stupid Toby Keith, Mr. American this and that! Did he forget our first amendment right, ""free speech""! Some kind of American!!!!!!! I feel that a lot of people forgot that. And am I the only one to see this last stupid war as a waste of time. I'm sure there was a better way of freeing Iraq besides killing American youth and causing even more people to hate us! BTW, where are those weapons of mass destruction? Oh, I know! In the arse Bush's head is stuck up, HIS OWN!

Think happy thoughts. I've been taking motorcycle lessons since I apparently inherited Glenn O'Leary's Harley. It turns out my love did have a will of sorts, nothing legal, just a letter telling where he wanted his things to go. The O'Leary family apparently had some issues that kept Glenn's side somewhat separated from the rest of his well-off family. I can't believe I knew someone for so many years and knew so little about him. I mean I knew his family didn't get along, but I never knew to what extent. He never liked to talk about it much. I just can't believe he left me a Harley! Me, of all people! Who knows if he would've lived a bit longer I probably would've got to know everything. I know that last winter when he went to Ireland, he stayed at his house that his parents left him, a matter of fact that's where he stayed most of the time he went. I probably would've known if I would've asked, but I just assumed he stayed with family and we kept being separated by school or detox or rehab or just not having enough time for each other these past few years. We mostly spent all the time we had together concentrating on us since time was so precious. Anywho, he didn't fully come into this stuff until he was 21, but he knew about it since his parents death. 

On another note, Glenn Quinn's birthday, I think I know what I'm going to do. I'm not much the praying type and whenever I try it usually ends with my yelling at God. The closest thing I'll do is light a candle for him at Trinity Church (Glenn O'Leary's church)and then I'll head down to Doyle's, enjoy a Guinness (raised to Glenn, of course), hang with some rowdy Irish, go home and wish Glenn a good one wherever he is! The one thing I will not do is cry or feel bad. I was talking to my friend Claudia about this and she agreed that ""that's the best way to keep Glenn's spirit. We miss him, but let's not forget the kind of person he was and in the end the last thing he wanted was people worrying about him."" Love ya :P Quinn! 

Oh, forgot the Nips! Nestle Nips are the best candy on Earth, I never buy them b/c I get addicted and it's happened once again! I've nearly finished the whole box! Later Days...

When I went up my name was yelled, I was applauded by more thanmy mom, and my picture looked like a deer caught in the headlights. Whatever, it still wasn't worth my time since I will never see these people again and when it mattered none bothered to figure out who I was.

The Matrix rocked! I don't know why people were saying it was confusing and thanks to my mother I missed the preview for the next one so it looks like I have to wait like everyone else.

Today I slept and it felt good. My grandmother amde me angry, later on my uncle infuriated me, and my aunt is more schizo than ever! I have the urge to pour out all my uncle's beer for pissing me off! I have to believe that someday I'll get away from here!

Enough of my trauma. I don't have the slightest clue as to what to do for Glenn Quinn's birthday still. It would've been nice if I had the time to organize something on-line, but I didn't and don't since it's so close. I'm searching for ideas. I went to a party for Glenn O'Leary's birthday and for GQ... I'll think of something! I still can't believe Buffy is gone and I was thinking how can Anya die too? 

I just got word two seconds ago that Ruben won on American Idol. Of course, I can care less about it since I can't stand the show, but to some it's a big deal.

In parting words screw Preident Bush! If we give him to Bin Laden and Hussein it would make the world a better place. Myabe they'll take him and leave the rest of us alone! Later Days..."

It was a great game and my first in a few years. I don't know why I stopped going to soccer games a few years ago. Soccer has always been my favorite sport and I always wanted to play, but a previous injury prevented me from playing for any real teams. OMG, it was so much fun and I can't remember ever getting this happy from watching them play and WIN!!"

"event","I am graduating in 2 days. I'm just not ""feeling"" it. Apparently everyone's telling me about this feeling I'm supposed to have and then when I let them know I don't have it, they automatically deduce it to my dead boyfriend. Listen he has nothing to do with it and I'm sick of people blaming his death for every time I feel differently about something. Do people remember who I am? Who I was before he died? I never got excited about events like this. If I want to celebrate I have my own ways and standing in front of a group of strangers wearing a robe and walking across a stage isn't my way of doing it. Take me to a concert, to the museum, send me to LA or Paris, take me to a play, better yet have Bono pop out of a box for me. All this is causing is trouble. My mom is already upset that I'm not dressing up and am wearing leather pants and Dr.Martens. I haven't even told the rest of my family and then I'll have to deal with that when I get back. After it shows up in the paper I will have to deal with the rest of the world. There's a reason I keep my life private and they know it and my friends know it, they know who I am and how I like to keep things separate.

In other news the end of Dawson's Creek!! What will I do now!?! I still haven't watched the 2 hour finale, I've recorded it and decided that after graduation will be a better time. Angel is returning next season which I wouldn't particularly care about since the finale was such a let down for me and since Glenn Quinn was out and Wesley was in it seemed to lose some of its pizazz. The only thing that's making me care and is forcing me to watch every episode next season is the cast addition of my love James Marsters aka Spike. Oh look, another great graduation celebration idea, take me to see James band Ghost Of The Robot!!

In more ""other news"" I slept with Ian.
Pick your jaw up off the floor that's all I did was sleep. We fell asleep on my couch (in the house with 5 other relatives! can't get much more innocent than that!) while watching the Tall Man in Phantasm. This led to me having a very interesting dream and Ian waking me up while I slammed him on the floor, shoved my elbow in his stomach while nearly breaking his leg. What did Ian do? What he always does, he laughed and asked me in his beautiful upper-class Dublin accent ""Are you the next Slayer?"" to which I replied ""I am the <i>only</i> Slayer! We had a good laugh, I apologized for nearly ""slaying"" him and he called <b>the car</b> to pick him up. It was nice.

In yet another ""other news"" I can't wait to see my beloved Ewan McGregor in ""Down With Love"". Ewan is one of those great actors who rarely get the credit he deserves. I just bought the new Marilyn Manson CD, ""The Golden Age of Grotesque"", but have yet to find the time to listen to it. I watched Orange County again, I love that movie! I loved X2 and I had to buy a Nightcrawler doll, the big one. I still have to see The Matrix since I didn't want to wait in line the day I was down there and I still have to get this piece of crap computer fixed so I can get it to start up more than once every few days. What would've been Glenn Quinn's 33rd birthday is coming up soon. I guess that's all for now and I think this is the most I've ever posted anywhere on-line besides my sites. Later Days."

"event","""Down the dark decades of hell, this will seem like a mear memory of heaven.""
-Pinhead, Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth

The more I watched this film repeatedly, over and over again for the last few weeks, the more I realized how similar to the characters I am. I've always known I had a lot in common with Pinhead, I think we all have a thing for ""good suffering"" occasionally, it's what makes life more interesting. Now since I've got my Angel of Hell syndrome out of the way, onward to better things.


One more project to go and classes will be over for this semester. Will I graduate finally this year? Right now, I don't really care, I'm just happy to breathe again. This semester has been the worst with people dying at the wrong times and machines doing the same (is there a right time? no, but there are better times!) I may not graduate because I had three days to get in two huge research papers starting from scratch and without a computer!!! Oh well, whatever happens happens and I'm just happy I'm finally getting a break and summer's (almost)here!

Things I'm looking forward to: tomorrow I'm hopefully seeing X2. I thought about this this morning and realized I have a stupid plan. I didn't want to go the first day after seeing the lines at the movies, so I came up with the brilliant plan of going Sunday when there'll be less people. I'm thinking Saturday everyone and their mother goes out, so Sunday will be better and I might actually get to sit where I want. I completely forgot tomorrow is the Walk For Hunger, and Sunday is almost everyone's day off, and the thousands of tourists we have all be out on the street! Today probably would've been better, but too late now so we'll see what happens!

What else have I been up to? Nothing much, just near death experiences, breakdowns, talking with ""my Rabbi"" (no, I'm not Jewish), and ... well none of that matters.

"event","Reflections is the last video tribute I've made and probably ever will make for Glenn Quinn. It took a bunch out of me and I think it was really the song that did it. It was officially supposed to be a screensaver, but what do you know I found a bug in my program so I left it as a video. Of course this was all done because of my recent good cyber-buddy <lj user=""catecumen"">. Glenn Quinn, an amazing person who we will miss worldwide, but i guess the same is true for everyone. Corrrect that, unfortunately it's not true for everyone, some people die very lonely and are forgotten or looked back on badly, Glenn hasn't suffered this fate so at least that's one positive thing.

"event","And what a happy one it was. I know I'm a few days late, but it was an <i>extended</i> party I thought I was going to be awful and depressed missing Glenn O'Leary and Glenn Quinn, but in fact it was the exact opposite. It would've been perfect if they were her, but they aren't so I guess i can still use the word <b>GREAT</B>.

First things first, before I even met up with my friends I met this guy named Ian who needed directions. Ian--dark hair, blue eyes, medium height, medium build, and a lovely Dublin accent-- wanted to know how to get to Doyle's downtown, so I told him I could escort him since I was headed that way! He was really nice and really funny, we had a lot to talk about and I might end up seeing him again!

There were other things besides Ian. I went to visit my Glenn, I left green carnations, green tulips, and a big green smiley balloon with a shamrock on it. I wished him a happy anniversary and while I was there wished Glenn Quinn a Happy St.Patrick's Day. I guess the best we can do is hope that they're both someplace better now without stupid George W. and without an impending war... sorry that's another story. Anywho I can't wait to graduate and hopefully I have a chance at a good, long future!

"event","I've started meditating again! Which is probably why I didn't choke someone for ditching me last night. I'm re-finding my inner peace, so to speak. So all the stuff that happened yesterday, I've lost whatever excitement I had for it and now don't feel like talking about it. Who am I kidding!?! I've made some decisions about my upcoming life, I say upcoming b/c while boggled in classes I'm not living, just merely existing. Anywho, I really want to get back into some artsy stuff and was thinking of auditioning for some things, I also have to get a real job this summer to start paying back some very real loans. At this point, I think I would like something not too demanding, which means I'll probably take a break from the whole music thing for a while and find a nice quiet library or something. No, really, I mean it.

I am so angry I missed out on White Stripes tix, I completely forgot they were coming to town. <strong>I NEED A CONCERT!!</strong> The last event I went to was Disney On Ice. It was actually quite enjoyable, I haven't been to it for a few years. OK, now I really don't feel like getting into yesterday. Later Days...

but most of all you like to have fun.


<b>About this quiz, it was hard since i basically had two answers for each question (except the last one!) so I took it twice! Above are my first results, below are my second. And you thought you were <i>screwed up</i>!!</b>

"event","It's still a good day, with the only exception being my grandmother. St. Patrick's Day is coming up, it was one of my and Glenn's anniversaries, the only one I remember, our last one. I found a carnation today that he gave me from last St. Patrick's Day, it's all dried up and I'm surprised it survived my mess of a closet.

In lighter news, <lj user=""markyd""> helped me for a brief 5 minutes before he took off for more pressing matters, thanks for all your help! It's late and I have a lot more to write, but don't have the time. I guess I'll post a little memo tomorrow morning. Good Night."

"event","This is the story of a girl...
Today has been a really good day, Boston has yet to let me down! Just when I thought things couldn't get better they do. How? I don't know, I woke up with a smile and a tune in my head. I went shopping with my mom and had a lot of fun and things just seemed different. Actually, it was different, it's warm!!! There's still a load of snow in the backyard and tomorrow it's supposed to cool down and maybe more snow, but that's tomorrow. I don't know, do you always have to have a reason for being happy? Well, I deserve it. It's true, try a day in my moccasins!

My best friend Marky is happy now that his trial is over! My other friend Jason is doing well considering what he experienced these past few weeks (sorry for my part in that!). He auditioned for Puppetry of The Penis so I'll say he's getting back to normal (yes, that's normal for him!). Love you guys!

Let's see I'm falling in love with Art Alexakis again! I don't care what anyone says, this new Everclear album rocks!! Since their first album Everclear has really helped me survive. Is it possible for someone else to live your life? Art has definitely lived mine! I guess that shows my mental state. Dawson's Creek is another repeat so I get to read more for my gendered genres class tonight (BLAH!):P.
Later Days

~<B>LOVE<B> the hidden track on Everclear's *new* album!!~"

I miss not feeling sick over the thought of having no one every morning.
I miss not being sick everytime i drank one goddamn beer.
I miss being genuinly happy.
I miss not having anyone to talk to.
I miss my best friends and my worst enemies.
I hate being too proud to talk to you.
I hate feeling like I did something wrong.
I hate that Ill never see you people again.
I hate this heavy feeling in my chest.
I hate that it wont go away.
I hate crying.

From my cave, where you're displayed like photographs that bleed

I am hate everlasting with each sickly spell I'm casting.

I discard all feelings.
The stars scar my ceiling.
Sun, I won't spare you. Moon, I won't spare you.

And my pain is mine. It's become my friend with time.
Chia-like, it grows. Watch it fester for my foes.
One day, I'm gonna get up and get right back into the city with my flamethrower mouth.
You bet your life it won't be pretty.

I discard all my feelings.
As the stars still scar my ceiling (oh)
I won't spare you. (Whoa) I, I won't spare you.

Photograph (bath), photograph (bath), photograph
Why'd you have to go and take a picture of a life like that?
You aren't new enough. I give up, I give up, I give up on you.

Look at you (you), look at you (you), look at you (you).
Pretty boy floating face down in a pond of glue.
You aren't new enough. We give up, we give up, we give up on all those like you.

whats the point of having this stupid fucking journal anymore when i rarely use and when i do use it i dont really write about anything important or interesting. and who fucking reads this anyway? Aileen and Ellen? woohoo. sorry im feeling bitter this evening.
well in case anyone DOES actually read this besides aileen and ellen..ill tell you about my oh so exciting life as of last week.
Tuesday, on my way to work, i put on my signal to turn, but there was a car coming in the othwer direction so i had to stop. well the ASSHOLE behind me on his cell phone going about 45mph in a 30 ""didnt even have time to tap the brakes"" (as he intelligently told the policeman) and slammed into my fucking car. undriveable. the bumper was stuck to the back tires. $8000 worth of damage. totaled...we paid $3000 for it. so i have to have it totalled (probably worth about $5000) and my dad will get me a new car at the auction. until then im driving the rickety old van. oh boy. anyway..about the guy...he got ""several tickets"" according to the policeman...including cell phone ($100), speeding, and wreckless driving. dunno if there was anything else but thats pretty good i guess plus his car was pretty fucking bad...his hood was folded in half and his headlights smashed and blah blah blah...do you guys even care? i went to the er...waited 4 and a half hours for them to tell me i have a whiplash, which is what i said to begin with, but i got a doctors note for no gym all week, no work for 2 days (still get paid for it though), and a perscription for hydrocodon...me and my dad stole 3 pairs of slippers (he stole those) a gown, a tongue scraper, latex gloves, and a urine sample cup. lol i dunno why 'cause we could i guess? went back to work today...i almost forgot how much i hate retail. and later this week i get to do inventory! yeeeees xD i get paid time and a half and dont have to deal with shitty customers. prom was friday. Aileen looked awesome...she'll probably put pictures up on her journal when i send them. Jenna was really pretty too...and she was a princess...on court, whatever you wanna call it. and nick was really pretty...thats probably the only time ill ever see him dressed up. he looked good. my mom helped him shave. he shaved! =) my dad had gotten us a white '73 rolls royce. i felt really pretty and everyone kept telling me i looked so. me and Nick slow danced and kissed. we fought too but i wont go into details about that..it doesnt matter anyway. we left 20 minutes early and watched fireworks together in congress park. we went and got food and i brought him home. im tired now so im going."

he got out of car and said ""wow im so sorry i looked dow and saw my mom calling and i didnt even have time to tap on my breaks"" yeah lets say that to a cop...real fucking intelligent.
so i have no car because the bumper was hanging off and stuck to the back tires...$8000 worth of damage so way more than totaled. the guy said i could probably get about $5000 for it...so my dads gunna do that and buy me a new car.
parents made me go to the hospitl and get checked out..was tere for 4 and a half hours before they even took my xrays..which showed that i hadnt broken anything...have whiplash though. head,neck,shoulders and back are really sore and i hit my knee on the steering wheel. i think i hit my head on the steering wheel too but i dont remember. im dumb and i didnt have y seatbelt on.

And jump on your bed
Throw my arms around you and kiss your sweet face
You smell like home
I whisper make love to me
You lick my cheek and stroke my hair
Hold me tight
There are tears on my lashes and
Im gasping for breath
Youre pushing hard I look into your eyes and see my fucking insides
You are me
You are in me
You are part of me.


I wrote that poem last week forgot to update it though.

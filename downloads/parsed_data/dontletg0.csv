"event","There has never been something so good that has happened to me in my life..And every day he makes it a little more clearer why I am so happy now. Figure that one out. I wake up happy. I go to bed happy. I watch TV and I am just happy. With my life. With my choices. With my looks. I think the devil stole his soul a long time ago...He doens't fit in well with my animal rescue plans. Or being who I want to be. All it is, is just some wasted kisses and money spent on a lost cause..You know when all your family and friends think hes an idiot..You should of listened a long time ago, back when they told me he was mooching off me and living there for free. He'll get his.. 

Things I wish I didn't give him:
my computer desk
gucci my fish
my blanket
the many bottles of cologne
the many shirts
rings
silver key chain
the many dinners at the thai house
my heart (I got that one back)
my flesh
and last but never least the best kisses in the whole wide world.

I can breathe now though. So we will call it an even trade."

"event","I haven't been this happy in almost two years..Its insane. Its like a load of bricks has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel free..Its great knowing that I don't have to settle for someone who didn't love me or respect me and that there are people out there that do..I feel sexy, and beautiful, and I am having a blast. I am growing into me, instead of growing into someone else. I'm happy with what have and don't feel that I am always being put down. I understand my thoughts and I can think clearly. I hate to think that I am better than ""some people"" but I have say I do. I kinda look back and think that I wasted money on a lost cause..But whatever I will live and learn..I can't tell you how good it feels to hang out with people that think I am amazing..And still have a blast. It was hard for about a week but the ski clears and when it does you wake and its all over."

Though I don't really know what
I'm going to do when I get there
Take a breath and hold on tight
Spin around one more time
And gracefully fall back to the arms of Grace
 
I am hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more than to sit
Outside heaven's door and listen to you breathing
Is where I want to be"

My mistakes will make me strong
I'm stepping out into the great unknown
I'm feeling wings though I've never flown
I've got a mind of my own
I'm flesh and blood to the bone
I'm not made of stone
Got a right to be wrong
So just leave me alone
I've got a right to be wrong
I've been held down too long
I've got to break free
So I can finally breathe
I've got a right to be wrong
Got to sing my own song
I might be singing out of key
But it sure feels good to me
Got a right to be wrong
So just leave me alone

You're entitled to your opinion
But it's really my decision
I can't turn back I'm on a mission
If you care don't you dare blur my vision
Let me be all that I can be
Don't smother me with negativity
Whatever's out there waiting for me
I'm going to faced it willingly"

I never want to let you down or have you go, it's better off this way.
For all the dirty looks, the photographs your boyfriend took,
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor?
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems?
(I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but don't know what it means
(I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look, another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time take a good hard look!

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
YOU WEAR ME OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book, but the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay!
(Trust Me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay

US Preparing for Military Draft in Spring 2005
by Adam Stutz * Wednesday January 28, 2004 at 09:50 AM
The current agenda of the US federal government is to
reinstate the draft in order to staff up for a
protracted war on ""terrorism."" Pending legislation in
the House and Senate (twin bills S 89 and HR 163)
would time the program so the draft could begin at
early as Spring 2005 -- conveniently just after the
2004 presidential election!
Reinstatement of the draft

Dear Friends and Family,

I urge you to read the article below on the current
agenda of the federal government to reinstate the
draft in order to staff up for a protracted war on
""terrorism.""

Pending legislation in the House and Senate (twin
bills S 89 and HR 163) would time the program so the
draft could begin at early as Spring 2005 --
conveniently just after the 2004 presidential
election! But the administration is quietly trying to
get these bills passed NOW, so our action is needed
immediately. Details and links follow.

If voters who currently support U.S. aggression abroad
were confronted with the possibility that their own
children or grandchildren might not have a say about
whether to fight, many of these same voters might have
a change of mind. (Not that it should make a
difference, but this plan would among other things
eliminate higher education as a shelter and would not
exclude women -- and Canada is no longer an option.)

Please send this on to all the parents and teachers
you know, and all the aunts and uncles, grandparents,
godparents.... And let your children know -- it's
their future, and they can be a powerful voice for
change! Please also write to your representatives to
ask them why they aren't telling their constituents
about these bills -- and write to newspapers and other
media outlets to ask them why they're not covering
this important story.

The Draft*

$28 million has been added to the 2004 Selective
Service System (SSS) budget to prepare for a military
draft that could start as early as June 15, 2005. SSS
must report to Bush on March 31, 2005 that the system,
which has lain dormant for decades, is ready for
activation. Please see website:
http://www.sss.gov/perfplan_fy2004.html to view the
SSS Annual Performance Plan - Fiscal Year 2004.

The Pentagon has quietly begun a public campaign to
fill all 10,350 draft board positions and 11,070
appeals board slots nationwide.. Though this is an
unpopular election year topic, military experts and
influential members of Congress are suggesting that if
Rumsfeld's prediction of a ""long, hard slog"" in Iraq
and Afghanistan [and a permanent state of war on
""terrorism""] proves accurate, the U.S. may have no
choice but to draft.

http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5146.htm

Congress brought twin bills, S. 89 and H.R. 163
forward this year, entitled the Universal National
Service Act of 2003, ""To provide for the common
defense by requiring that all young persons [age
18--26] in the United States, including women, perform
a period of military service or a period of civilian
service in furtherance of the national defense and
homeland security, and for other purposes."" These
active bills currently sit in the Committee on Armed
Services.

Dodging the draft will be more difficult than those
from the Vietnam era remember. College and Canada will
not be options. In December 2001, Canada and the US
signed a ""Smart Border Declaration,"" which could be
used to keep would-be draft dodgers in. Signed by
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, John Manley, and
US Homeland Security Director, Gov. Tom Ridge, the
declaration involves a 30-point plan which implements,
among other things, a ""pre-clearance agreement"" of
people entering and departing each country. Reforms

greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter
and somehow you make it better
ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
and it's yours and it's mine like the sun
And at the end of the day
we should give thanks and pray
to the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you
Have I told you there's no one else above you
Fill my heart with gladness
take away all my sadness
ease my troubles that's what you do

The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want 
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness 
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted 
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me you're already 
The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)

tear at the darkness all around me

waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks
a wild fire born of frustration 
born of the one love that gets me so high
Ive no fear at all

Would your eyes like midnight fireflies 
light up the trenches where my heart lies 
until I can see again 
to find my way back again

To fall so deep into you 
lose myself completely 
in your sweet embrace 
all my pains erased

From your mouth its all that I wish 
the mercy of your lips just one kiss 
until I can breathe again 
so that I can sing again"

Take me to a place so holy

Dear god, 
  Hold me up, cause I can't do it by myself right now. I am sure I deserve what has come my way..For not holding the door for the older lady, for not letting that guy pass me on I4, or for not understanding how great my life is, and that maybe I should look at the good instead of all the bad. Lately I haven't woke up and said thank you. But I am really thankful I promise. I have had negative thoughts about people and thats not like me. I don't want to be that person, who is always down. I am sure there is a reason you put me here. And I am trying to find out what it is, but for now, when I start to cry tap me on the shoulder and tell me it will be ok. Cause I need you more than I know.

Rule of thumb. DON't fuck with me three days before my period. I get angry. I guess it just all comes down to maybe its not a good idea for us to be together. Why does he have to be so pretty. Its ok there is always prettier. That goes for me to though. Some people may say I am cute but there is cuter. I just need to go out and I have fun. But its a sad thing cause I don't know what they is anymore. The past six months my fun time was watching movies and laying in bed till noon. My only care in the world was if he was happy. Because I knew how happy he made me. I have never felt like this when these kind of sittuations have arose. Is never made me have a bad day. Its never made the taste of ungodly. Doesn't that mean something. Is there such a thing as too much passion..Its a passion to love then a passion to hate. To be continued..."

I can't believe i believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think
She was from your past
Silly of me to dream of 
One day having your kids
Love is so blind 
It feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe i fell for four years
And i'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me
You're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete
When you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now i moved on

Cuz i realized i got 
Me myself and i
That's all i got in the end
That's what i found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

So controlling , you said that you love me 
But you don't
Your family told me one day
I would see it on my own
Next thing i know i'm dealing
With your three kids and my home
I've been so blind
It feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
No need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend 
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time 
But now i am strong

Because i realized i got 
Me myself and i
That's all i got in the end
That's what i found out 
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend

Me myself and i
I know that i will never disappoint myself
All the ladies if you feel me
Help me sing it now
Ya, you hurt me
But i learned a lot along the way
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
I know that i will never disappoint myself"

"event","Last weekend was awesome! Thursday Paul and his brother Wayne came down to visit me, I made a kick ass pot of chili. The boys had ate before they arived but Wayne ended up eating a chili-dog and said it was awesome. Then Paul talked me into going to his house for the night so I rode in the back of his itty bitty car giving Wayne the front seat...Paul massaged my feet on the way to his home LOL. Anyway we arived to his house and went straight to his room and watched a movie and cuddled it was great. 
We woke up early Firday and left to come back to Granite because I had to drive mom home from her eye doctors appointment. We got home about 11 and I showered and then mom showed up and me, her and Paul went to her doctors appointments. We had to drop her off at valley and take the car to the parking lot so she wouldnt be late for her appointment. Paul and I got to the eye doctors appointment in time to go back with her and I got to see a pic of her eye....it was so cool the retina and all!!! I was EXCITED LOL. After that appointment we had to go up to the 14th floor where Aunt Sarah works so mom could see Doctor Rauwer about her leg. So me and Paul left to go down to the cafetira and get something to much on and then came back up in time to to meet mom comming out of the office and we left to get lunch. Ended up going to Itty Bitty resturant and dad met up with us it was a good lunch.

The next day we woke up at 4 am and the whole family including Paul drove to TN to see aunt Violet and Uncle Dotson. Arived there around 10 and they made us an awesome lunch and dinner and just stayed up chatting and catching up.Went over to my cousin Kevins and seen him and his son Ben (the one that had cancer) and chatted with them well Paul and dad did mostly about hunting LOL. We got Aunt Violets movie Million Dollar Baby (thats a good movie) and went to Walmart walked around there for a bit and came back to watch a movie and chit chat some more. 
Woke up Sunday to aunt Violet making us breakfast at like 8am cause Pauls damn alarm clock was left on his cell phone and his cell phone was in the room with me!! Then we sat around chit chatting some more and Kevin came over to visit before we left. Then Aunt Violet made us another amazing lunch and we left around 4 to head back home caught some crazy ass rain and then arived home around 9. Paul stayed the night because it was so late and also his car battery was dead from leaving the lights on. 
Monday I spent the whole day cuddeling with Paul and made awesome chicken n dumplings...my first time ever. Paul was going to stay kinda late and leave because he didnt have a job to go back to but his car battery was dead once again so he stayed the night again spending more time with me and left on Tuesday....not Im just waiting to see him tomorrow. All in all I had an amazing weekend with my family and my wonderful boyfriend!!"

"event","So Friday I went and got my braces off!! Yes they look so good but my goodness no one told me it hurts getting them off. The taste of blood in your mouth for a half hour and having to rince is really gross. Im very excited to have them off and have such a dramstic change its awesome. My parents with with me to the orthedentist and it was a really fun experience to say the leaset. We went to red lobster to celebrate afterwards, it was awesome...our waiter was so cute he was short and from the south had a cute accent. Then when we got home my baby was here it was great. We hung out and went over to Sarah and Buddys to watch and Em and Al till Buddy got home so Sarah could go to the airport. We had a lot of fun and Paul bought me 5 dollars worth of sticky candy it was awesome. Once Buddy got home we left and came home to go swimming and watched The Hoastage that movie is crazy for sure!! Welp we passed out after that.
Saturday we woke up and decided to have quiznos for breakfast...why not we didnt wake up till close to noon anyway. We went to Hallmark first to get a gift for Aunt Vickis birthday (which is the 3rd same as the twins). It was funny me and Paul stood there for a good half hour going threw al lthe candles smelling them saying ""oh smell this one"" we stopped after he busted me in the nose with the jar and agreed to get butter cream candle. We picked out a funny card and then paid and had it gift wrapped it was so pretty. Well we went to Quiznos and I had ot use Pauls phone to call the house to see what Zach wanted that was an interesting conversation. After we got mine, Pauls and Zachs food we headed home to eat..it was interesting and really good for the first time eating there. We rested and let food settle and then had to shower and get ready to go to Casa Guallrdo (sp) for aunt Vickis birthday dinner at 6:30....we all went that was a lot of fun, (Mom, Dad, Zach, Paul, Me, Rhonda, Ed, Vicki and Chuck) like I said everyone. We had a good dinner and then went back to Vickis house for cake and coffee and a 4 hour conversation. Somehow me and Paul came up and the plans of marriage and my mom told them we was talkin about getitng Married 08-08-08 it was interesting to say the least!!
Sunday everyone came back over for dinner here we had steak out on the grill mom did an awesome job. We all kinda hung out by the pool and chit chatted like we did the night before I love my family and b/f, they're the bomb!! We had a lot of fun over the weekend.
Today I had to wake up at 7:30 to babysit Hunter. I felt so bad he had an ear ache and was teething he kept crying the whole time I had to feed him and give him some childrens tylenol then he passed out for a little bit so that was good he slept and broke his fever and we played till Sherry came to get him when he was sleeping again LOL. Then ive been just chillin talkin to some friends and makin plans for tomorrow."

"event","So been awhile since Ive posted again. Sorry peeps been a bit busy! Everyone that was curious on how Pauls b-day went, it went very well I think! I made him dinner on friday (spaghetti, salad, garlic bread and a carrot cake for dessert). He decortated the cake himself it was the cutest thing ever. Then we rented movies and watched them all that was a lot of fun. Saturday I woke him up at 9 am and we went to the BJC picnic with my mom and aunts that was interesting ot say the least, we got lost LOL. Not to mention it was hot as hell so me and Paul bailed a bit early. Came home and got cleaned up...took him to Applebees and a movie for his b-day (I think he had a good time). Then Sunday we went to Fairveiw heights to look for him a new cd player for his car. Didnt realize that nothing in fairveiw doesnt open till 11am on Sundays I was pissed, but we found him a nice cd player he bought and installed in his car from best buy it kicks ass. (that was all the weekend of the 15th)

Threw out the week I went to SWIC and finally registered after 3 trips there!! I only go to school on Tuesday and Thursday so thats kick ass anyone want to know my classes just ask and I can tell ya.

Anyway this weekend was a lot of fun. Friday Paul got off early and came to get me to go to Hannibal. Friday when we got to his house we went to get some sonic and rented movies to watch. We crashed after the Diary of Ellen Brenbauwer (sp?) anyway the sequal to Rose Red. Got up at about 9am Sunday morning to his mom making us an awesome breakfast and then sending us to work in the garage. That was interesting after a few hot hours in a garage some of us got pissy but we all worked around it. Got Pauls water bed set up, thats a story in itself LOL...they're cold the first night out. That   evening we went to Andrews birthday party at his house, had some bbq and chilled on the lake. Alot of fun and tons of stars I think I warmed up rather nicely couldve been the beer too who knows. Dude being a little tipsy and having to walk threw high grass past an barb wired fence up to the house to go pee is a pain but interesting walk with Alicia we had some fun conversation and tried to do the pee dance up to the house LOL. I believe I had a killer hang over on Sunday it was a fun car ride home tho well long and hot at times but we made it. Now I miss Paul and feel bad for him cause hes not feeling well and Im not there to help him my poo baby. I love him bunches and cant wait too see him this weekend."

"event","I havent posted in quite some time so I figured I would. Glade to hear everyone had a great 4th of July. Mine was spent from the 1st-5th in a camper with Paul. we had some good times....I got to meet all of his family and they seem to really like me so thats a plus.  Went out on some boats and played around in the lake its absolutley beautiful down there. I met his friends Andrew and Alicia they're a cute couple.He took me to the rodeo, that was a lot of fun the downside to that I met his ex g/f (the one he lived with and was goin to marry). Guys dont ever introduce your new g/fs to the old its not a good idea.  I got stung by a wasp  5 times that hurt like a bitch (wont go into details). The 4th of July we went to hannibal to watch the fireworks display. That was awesome we sat right on the river front and had  huge fireworks that you heard them before you seen them and they light up the sky needless to say  30,000 dollars well spent. We came home on the 5th couldnt have been more excited about that let me tell ya I was gettin home sick.

This weekend Paul came back down, not the greatest but it was alright. He bought me a dozen red roses and we went to dinner and rented some movies on Saturday. Sunday he took me to family Fun time and we rode go carts and bumper boats (got stung by a bee again) then we played arcade games and came home. We swam for a bit and decided steak sounded good so we went to ravenelis it was yummy. We came home and he left and I went with my family, Sarah Buddy and the twins to Ruby Tuesdays to sit and chit chat while they ate that was a lot of fun. 

Today I'm hear babysitting, made a call to college and made an appointment for tomrrow to schedule classes. Still gotta figure out something to get Paul for his b-day if you got any ideas leave one for me!!"

Anyway this weekend was great after all. Friday night I went out with Stacie and Beth to Wild Country. It was a lot of fun, thanks girs. Carolyn showed up and kinda spiced things up, we need to dance more next time. Although I'm not complaining the cowboy was totally hot and I spotted him first. Mike was a butthead for not going out there.

Saturday was really cool too had family over for a BBQ and went swimming all day. Uh after being outside in 90 plus degree weather nothings more refreshing then swimming unless the pool water is warm then it like yuck.

Sunday my kiddos came over, they're so damn cute. Emma and Al went swimming they love the water. We had dinner together and afterwards Emma wanted to play dress up....shes so damn bossy makes me happy. LOL my little mini me.

So anyway the rest of this week will be basicly cleaning and doing laundry getting ready for my camping trip with Paul I cant wait!!! YAY."

"event","Well Thursday my baby came down and suprised me with a little visit. He took Friday off because of Blake and Lindsey's weddings. So we decided to drive to his sister Debbies house and stay the night with her...we got there around 12 and she stayed up and talked to us for a bit Dan and the kids where already in bed.

Friday we woke up arund 9 when Debbie left ot go tanning. She came back and we talked for awhile and Paul got a crazy idea to go wake up Dan he was cuddeling with his teddy bear it was a funny sight. Anyway we had to drive back to my house so he could drop me off cause I had graduation. Well when I got home my mom was pissed because she wanted to spend time with me and go to lunch but she thought I got home to late. Yeah made no since at all cause I got home around noon and graduation wasnt until 7 and i had to be there by 4....yeah Gabe Jen and I went to Olive Garden and still made it home in time for my gradution so nah. Graduation went by so fast it was awesome only lasted an hour and a half. I blew up a beach ball that was funny so was our attempted senior prank that slowly failed. I was happy to see my family out there well the important ones anyway!! Along with the my friends thanks you all. I left shortly after and chilled with the family notinng much more then that.

Saturday I had ot get up early and shower and get ready to go to Hannibal. I got up at 8 and made coffee for my parents before I got into the shower. We left ot get on the road some time around 10 but I had to go to hardies cause I was starving. Anyway I fell asleep in the car and got there around noon and yeah Paul wasnt at his house and i had a little bit of a panic attack but I called him and got a hold of him he went to the bank. Once he arived to his house we left to go to taco bell so I could meet his friends Blake and Brice (they're hot MARINES!!) Anyway we had to go to the church so they could set things up for the wedding and we helped them carry stuff in. Paul and I left to go get ready for the wedding. We went back to the church around 2 although the wedding didnt start till 4 so it was a long wait. The wedding was beautiful but the reception was a disaster if you want details I'll tell you about it later. Needless to say it led to mine and Pauls first fight I was so pissed and I cried!!! I'm still a little hurt by it but oh well.

Sunday was cool we drove back here to Granite for a family BBQ. Wasnt talkin much to Paul in the morning but I warmed up to him... Gabe got free tickets to the rage arena footbal game and he invited Paul, Jenny and Me to go with him. It was fun the Rage team won by over 30 points LOL Jenny was toasted....dont ask. We came back home and me and Paul cuddled on the couch and fell asleep.

Today we woke up around 11 and I made him and Zach french toast. While Gabe, Jenny, mom and dad went out to lunch, thats okay we stayed home and swam so nah. Had chicken and dumplings for dinner and I got to spend the day with my baby I love that kid!!!"

We decided to just highlight everything we pulled threw the cap blonde and it turned out a copper color but I like it!! My Boyfriend called around 12 and I talked to him on his lunch break and then he went back to work. Later in the evening he was at my front door I was so excited to see him, I missed him so much. I couldnt keep my hands and lips off of him...must be love LOL yeah corny I know. But he hung around with me and the girls and watched One Tree Hill or attempted to he did well I think LOL. Then we went out to Big Lots and no one was really there except my cousin Billy its always good to see him. Well we all left up there cause it was kinda lame and Paul had ot be heading back. We got to my drive way and it was a moment of kissing and talking total romance I love him so so much and then he said bye and had to leave IT MADE ME CRY!!

"event","So Friday was my last official day of school, it was so sad. I failed my algebra class, the final was HORRIABLE. Anyway at the end of the day the senior class of 05 gathered into the auditorium....Mr Mckechan (spelling?) Gave a gay ass speech and then handed it to Mr McBride who proceeded to ramble on. Who knows what they said we was all excited to be getting out. Anyway Tyler Crews our class president came forward with our senior flag and then they played ""Lean On Me"" and EVERYONE started singing and swaying back and forth with friends....it was a great moment!! After that we all headed out to the flag pole for the traditional hanging of the senior flag. I took Pics of me and Patrick Nailer for Emily and then just a pic of him by himself to give to Em....she freakin drooled over it LOL. Well after that we all got to run to our cars and proceed out of the parking lot honking and yelling out the windows. As I was leaving with Amanda Clark I seen my Jenny sitting on the strip and honked she got out and was like hello and I seen someone in the car and thought it was Gabe....well as we passed the car I seen it was my b/f Paul. The butthead worked 14 hours on Thursday so he could come suprise me on my last day of school and spend the whole weekend with me. He's AWESOME uh I seriously love that kid to death. So we drove to the back parking lot and I got out of the car and gave Paul a big hug. Paul called Emily on Jennys cell phone and she came running up poor thing was freezing and had to sit between to weird guys while looking for me. But I slowly warmed her up with Patricks smile and she was all good!! We all decided to go to my house and make graduation cookies, OMG they where so good and so was the cookie dough LOL. Later Jenny and Em had to get home so I was a little sad but it was ok. Paul and I decided to go for a drive and get lost....we started driving and somehow ended up in towns past Jerseyville with a population of only 300 so we decided to turn around. We seen a lot of beautiful homes uh they was awesome. It was a lot of fun just some bonding time for me and him. We came home and my mom made us some cheeseburgers and we stayed on the couch cuddeling watching a movie but went to bed shortly after.
Saturday we woke up around 9 and decided to shower and get ready to go to the ZOO.....YAY!!! Well Paul wanted chinese before we went to the ZOO so me, him and my dad went to the Great Wall for lunch. Paul payed for me and my dad aww so sweet. Food was okay but I wasnt impressed....when we got home everyone was ready to go to the ZOO. My whole family and Paul went to the ZOO and we had a blast. I got a lot of cute pictures and a souviner mug incase we all go back. Mom had us make a pack that we go every month so we'll see how that hold out. Anyway we left the Zoo around 4:30 so we could get home cause I had a party at 8 and thought me and Paul was going to go to the olive Garden before the party (didnt happen). Paul got to meet Amanda and sat over there for a bit before the party at 8. It was an all girl party so Paul and Zach had some male bonding and drove around Granite talking. I left the party a little before 9 cause of some stupid shit but not going to get into that. Had Paul come and pick me up and we went to Hollywood Video where we got National Treassure....went home to attempt to watch it. Although we endded up leaving to get jack in the box, before we got food we stopped by big lots and seen the crew. Guth and Alex was drunk, got to see my girlys and give them hugs, talked to Mccousky too. We only stayed a short while and then went and got food and back to the house to watch National Treassure....didnt watch it all kinda fell asleep on Paul and woke up for the end of it. We went to bed shortly after that so yeah.
Sunday I woke Paul up at 10 with the goodmorning song HAHA. Got into the shower and left around 11:30 to go to Hannibal for Paul mom suprise Party. Didnt go as well as we thought, people where freakin bitchy. So me and Paul kinda bailed out and went to his room and laid and cuddled and talked, his sister Debbie left and she was my ride to Wentzville so my parents could pick me up half way. So yeah Paul had to take me to Wentzville but before we left he mowed the lawn and my poor baby busted his ankle when a stick came flying out of the lawn mower....it was purple and swollen gross. We got on the road a little after 6:30 and made good timing to Debbies house, we was doing 80 the whole way there tho!! Paul and I got into a wrestling match and called it even. My dad came and picked me up and I went home and watched National Treassure and Paul called me befoe he went to bed to say g'night and he loved me!!!"

"event","School wasnt all that great today, I'm finishing up finals but other then that it was great. Jen and Emily met up with me at school and gave me a ride home. Once there we decided to go shopping and get a bite to eat. We went to Hallmark to get Pauls mom something for her b-day and pondered around there in search of the perfect gift. Came up with some really good ideas....I'm sure people thought we was retarded shouting for eachother and pointing at things LOL. While there my lovely b/f calls Jenny cell phone and I hear him say hey Keep Beth at home and I was like hey I wanna talk to him and see what to get his mom. Well he ended up getting off the phone before I got the chance to talk to him and when I called back I knew he was up to something. He told me he was going fishing with his friend Jeff and so I told him to be safe and got off the phone with him. I became suspicous and told the girls he was going to come to Granite and then pnodered back and forth doubting myself. Anyway after not discovering anything at Hallmark, we went to Arbys to get some food. Emily and I got the 5 for 5.95 and we got 2 roast beef sandwhiches, 2 mozerella cheese stick and a soda to share... OH I got brewed tea it was yummy the food was awesome. On a full stomach we went back to Hallmark and I decided to get her a sun catcher but then thought about those tart warmers but couldnt find them anywhere....so Jenny came to my rescue and thats what we got her and had it wrapped all pretty.
We then came back to my house and got on the subject of chocolate chip cookies that we was supossed to make and didnt get around to it. So we got on the computer because I got my year book and there was a CD in it and we wanted to see what it was. While sitting at the computer Paul and his friend Jeff show up at my house. SUPRISE SUPRISE he's a little liar I'm sure he found some great fishing spots along the way!! I love him tho so its all good. We sat around and talked outside in the backyard for awhile. Beth P and her sister came over with their new puppy I want one so so bad, they're so cute. They hung around for a little while then had ot leave to get their mom some food but Beth came back and we came up with the idea to go swimming after Emily got thrown in the pool. So me, Paul, Jeff, Jen and Zach all went swimming till about 9 o'clock. We got out cause it was cold and mosquitoes where biting and we left to go to the parking lot. It was okay but not that grand and my poor baby left me TEAR...But I'll see him Saturday yay!!"

"event","So this weekend had its ups and downs!! Friday I didnt really do much of anything, I went shopping to look for a graduation outfit and one for the wedding. Ya I found a lot of cute stuff I might get later on but nothing for like a graduation...
Saturday I got up to my mom making Gabe cookies, yeah he got his way. Had a box full of yummy oatmeal cookies (which I stole some shhh) and some rum balls so he should be a happy kid. Then After I ate yummy cookies for breakfast I showered and packed my bag so I could go see my sweetheart PAUL!!! Before we left I talked my mom into going to Fashion Bug to see some of the outfits I picked for gradaution. Yeah totally didnt get any of the outfits, instead I got this really pretty dress. While we was there we got a phone call and found out my aunt has skin cancer so I freaked out and started crying that was BAD. I seriously need to stop taking life for granted, all this drama and shit isnt worth it. Family and close friends are far more important then trying to keep up with the crowd. So anyway, we headed to Wentzville to meet Paul half way at his sister Debbies house. Paul was a little late so we waited a few minutes....and then me and Paul left to go to Hannibal. I got him to watch the Notebook with me  its such a good movie!! After that we left to go to the lake and OMG it's awesome I cant wait till the 4th of July!! While we was at the lake Debbie and Dan called and asked if we went into the house and we said no, well come to find out someone broke into their house because the back door was unlocked and wide open with the screen ripped out they think we interupted the robbery kinda freaky so the cops was at Debbies and she was freakin out poor thing. Good news tho, nothing was taken from their home weird thing is Dans gun was taken out of the holder and was placed in the floor...hes a cop so ODD!! After that we left the lake and went to his friends Amanda and got stuck painting the babies room, its so cute the projected Sesame Street scenes all over the wall and was painting them in. We left there kinda late and just went home and slept.
Sunday we got up kinda early and his mom made blueberry muffins she's so sweet. After that we decided to get ready and head back to Granite. We stopped by Debbies first to say hi and her son got a splinter in his foot and threw this damn temper tantrum took me forever to get it out it was so funny tho. We left there around 3:30 and got to Granite around 5 or so....Had some BBQ with the family it was awesome. Moms food is always the best I'm sure you al lwould agree. After dinner Paul came up with the idea to go bug the girls so we went to Nattys and bugged her, Jen, Em and Carmen. Then Beth P called with some trouble so we went to her house and rescued her...we went to DQ and that was a riot ordering icecream with change. Ha Remember Paul saying something about the guy in the bathroom talking about pissing in the sink....that was funny. Not to mention our conversation at the tables, we're ate up. THERE WAS CHURCH PEOPLE THERE WE'RE GOIN TO HELL YA'LL!!! After embarassing everyone at DQ we left to go to Big Lots and hung out for a bit, Paul got to meet Alex....weird thing is Alex seemed cool with Paul and we all know Alex can be an asshole so that was cool. Me and Paul left around 9-9:30 because he had a 2 hour drive ahead of him so that kinda sucked but I had a great weekend. I love you all!!!"

"event","So everything around me slowly seems to be closing in on me and coming to an end. Friday was May Carousel which is the last official night for senior girls. A time to gather and be beautiful and realize the ""REAL WORLD"" is only getting that much closer. Ya start to get butterflies and stress starts to build up and  begin to realize some friendships that you've carried on throughoutt the years will be no more. Sad thing is no matter how hard you try things will never be the same, you can waist your time on trying to keep people close or the wrong people away but in the end the world is cruel and uncomfortable and full of empty cycles. Who truly knows what the world holds and what experiences are to be gained?? Guess it's all of what you want to make out of it in life or so I've been told. I dont want to grow up and loose the comfort and security of what I know, shit growing up is scary!!

Saturday I gathered it all and finally realized that its all coming to an end. I got Senior Pictures to be placed in graduation announcements to let people know I'm coming into this damn dark cycle of what is called the CAREER GOALS!! Bullshit what does it really matter you can spend a lifetime in schools and colleges and gain all the knowledge you want or need but in the end theres the same dark cruel real world out there that you yourself have to experience all on your own. THE WORLD IS WHAT PEOPLE MAKE OF IT!!. Seems like theres going to be a lot off assholes out there and then that occasional nice guy or girl. 

Whats with the freakin drama, every corner I cut and every step I come too theres drama lurking in the corners. DAMN IT TO HELL....I'm to the point that I could give a rats ass about DRAMA. People may say oh dramas only in elementary or junior high maybe even high school, but in all honesty its all over this freakin place. DAMN DAMN DAMN, I DONT REALLY CARE TO FILL MYSELF WITH IT, it's pointless and time consuming.

I've enjoyed these years but I'm thinking theres going to be a lot of changes over the summer. Some with friends and family others with  relationships. I love everyone and if we grew apart I'm sorry and dont think theres not a time you dont cross my mind because you do...."

"event","Again, it's been awhile since I've posted. Guess I've been a little busy, you all know how that is. School is coming to an end can you belive it...I graduate in like 3 weeks!! So anyway, this weekend and last weekend was good.

Last weekend was prom which was SO AMAZING. I had a blast with all my friends and we all looked amazing (Beth P, Aaron, Jake, Amy, Jen, Amanda, Jon, Eric and Sarah)...all at our table. David and Amber was lookin nice too so was Amy Rainwater (prom date stealer). The limo was so pimp and OMG the driver was freakin hot LOL. And no Beth I wasnt hitting on the limo driver I was being POLITE. They lied about the food tho, there was no damn fried chicken...what the hell!! It was chicken and rice thats something I didnt sign up for...I'M A FAT KID I GET WHAT I WANT. Oh well the cheesey mashpotatoes was pimp and so was the cherrry cheesecake. The background was so pretty for prom I cant wait to get pictures back. Yeah Beth I still gotta burn a cd with all my pics for you and Aaron, sorry...I'll get to it. I got Dave and Jake to dance after they said they wouldnt yeah I'm AWESOME. If you haven't seen Davids video of prom yet everyone should its so funny. I had such an amazing time, thanks everyone for having fun with no drama! 

After prom was aight too, I didnt stay long...Jake bailed on me and started dating Amy lol. Although me and Beth did this funny ass pogo fighting thingy I dunno how to explain it but I got it on my video camera and its funny as hell. If anyone wants ot see it let me know. Also got pics of Eric riding the mechanical bull, that was pimp!! I left with Beth and Aaron around 2 causei  was tired and went home and got Jack in the box tacos LOL. That was prom!!

This weekend I went to hannibal to see Paul, I love that kid so much. My parents decided to drive me down there, its a long ass drive didnt realize it till I was there LOL. Anyway, Saturday we didnt really do nothing special. I got to meet his uncle Larry he seems like a nice guy and I love his house! Then we left to go back to Pauls house where we cuddled watchin movies and ate pizza. Ha Paul broke his bed, it was so so funny guess you had to be there and see it kinda thing. Dont try to show off in a bed, sometimes it just doesnt work out LOL. Well Sunday his mom said they was having a family BBQ around 1....damn they have a big family like we do, I met EVERYONE and they all seemed to already know about me and was like yeah we've heard a lot about you. Hope it was all good stuff!!. We went out to Riverveiw Park, its so nice ot there they have amazing riverveiws to take pics hint the name of the park. Ha Paul, Dan and I drove to this veiw point and there was people making out in a car so we decided to get out and go up to the bluff right in front of their car. Well as we was leaving Dan was like HEY DUDE GET YA SOME and Paul said I SEE BOOBIES....yeah the morons didnt realize the window was open so we left rather quickly after that but I got pics of the bluffs and the river!! When we got back to the BBQ everyone was trying to start the grill and the guys was playing soft ball....my man can hit. Well once we got the BBQ done we realized it was a little to cold to be at the park so we packed everything up and went back to the house to eat LOL. The food was really good and I enjoyed spending time with his family, they're nice people. Afterwards we found out Pauls car has a leak so Dan and him went and bought a house to try to fix it. Well as I was leaving I told Paul to be careful in the car and not drive so crazy. He told me he was going to go over to Jeremy and Amandas to chill....yeah when I called him later that night to tell him I made it home he was getting out of a TOW TRUCK yeah he decided to gofor a joyride. Silly silly boy, what am I gonna do with him??? AHH LOVE HIM LOL"

"event","So it's been awhile since I posted, but really nothings changes. I spent the whole weekend with my baby, he's the best!! We went to his hometown Hannibal MO, its so cute, I could honestly move there and be fine with it. Its so hilly and a tourist town cause of Mark Twain but that stuff is cool...

Anyway he came and picked me up on Friday and we went to dinner and got gas. We was late leaving my house cause he got to see me in my prom dress which was good cause he wont be here for prom. It was cute cause he gave me a hug and kiss and said ""baby you're so beautiful"" AWWW I know right? But anywho, we drove what seemed like forever to get to hannibal it takes like 2 hours seriously. His house is so cute he lives up on a hill with a big huge yard  crazyness. We walked in and his mom was leaving to go to the boat to gamble so we wished her luck and went to the basement to watch Vanhelsink?? (spell that right,I dunno stupid movie). yeah Paul and I ended up asleep on the couch and finally wandered our way to bed around 12.

Saturday was cool, Paul left me for 4 hours to go to work but it was mostly while i was sleeping so its all good. His mom opened the door and was like ""are you sleeping I'm cooking breakfast come get some""....she made AWESOME biscuts and gravy, it was so good. I got to hear stories about Paul while he was at work and seen some baby pics he's so cute no matter what! I love that kid. Paul came home at 12 and his moms like lets take her out and show her Hannibal. Needless to say I seen Hannibal, all of it!! Theres this park close to where they live that has ducks that was cool. Then we went to the tourist areas and just looked around and decide on dinner. HAHA while at dinner Paul was like ""Oh shit here comes blabber mouth"" so I got to meet a memeber of their family that tells all the gossip and she was askin about me it was funny. We got back to his house in mid afternoon and just chilled got to watch the movie Vanhelsink all the way through and I decided I dont like it at all. I began to pick on him cause he was driving me crazy and I pulled his hair so buttmunch goes into the bathroom to shower and comes back with his head shaved so I cant pull his hair (he's still got leg hair) DUMMY!! LOL. We left and went to get gas and he introduced me to some of his friends, they all seem really cool....On our way over to his friend Jeremeny and Amanda he took me to the ghetto it didnt look like the ghetto there, therefore I didnt believe him till cops stopped in front of a house and was drawing their guns....scarey shit.

Sunday we just kinda chilled and cuddled. Main evet was YARD WORK yeah I got stringed into helping him and his mom do some yard work not sure how that happened. It was all good tho really nice weather and its always nice to help out, sure I made browny points with his momma. We went to tacobell with his mom, his sister her b/f and me and Paul that was nice just sat and chilled ate some taco bell. After that his mom decided to take me through a grave yard and show me where her dad and Pauls dad was burried and then we went out by the college and she told me I should go to college there. We also drove out to their river house thats a nice house right on the missouri river. While we was out there his sister Aggie called and she locked herself out of the house so we had to go uot there and break in. Paul had ot climb through a kitchen window, it was a sight to see...I got to hold his nephew noah hes so cute. Oh an Paul and I are great with kids, wink wink who knows what'll happen LOL. We got back and cuddled and stuff....Amanda came over at 6 and we headed back to Granite. She's got a cute baby I was in the backseat with him and he was singing and dancing, I luv that kid. Got home around 8:30 or so and everyone came in. The baby didnt like my doggie so I had to hold him and we knocked on the bathroom door buggin Paul but Paul came out and grabbed Jerimiha and said ""give me loving"" it was so cute!! They left after talkin and chillen for a few minutes, I walked them out and kissed and hugged Paul by....I cried. It always sucks when he has to leave I miss him so much cant wait to see him again. Thats my weekend other stuff happened just dont care to type anymore so ask away. I miss and lvoe everyone!!"

"event","So this weekend was AMAZING. Well Friday night around 5:30 Paul came over to pick me up. He got to meet my parents and I believe they like him so that's a good thing. Actually it really doesnt matter what they think cause he's not going anywhere for a long long time. Well we went to Wentzville MO. for a bonfire at his sisters house. She got engaged and we had a party, yadda yadda yadda and I stayed the night mmmmmhhhhhhhmmmm. LOL To much detail so if you want it just ask. His family is great, they're so nice I love his sister Debbie and her fiance Dan they crack me up ""TURTLE"" LOL.
Anyway, saturday we woke up at 9am to Paul sister callin. Well we decided we was hungry and had a hang over so we went to a some truck stop and got breakfast. It was yummy and Paul and Dan kept embarrassing me and Debbie but it was fun. After we had breakfast we decided to go shoot Dan's gun cause he's a cop and it's cool. Well we went to Wal-Mart to get tampons and shells for Dans gun. While walking in Dan starts to act retarded and ride on the little kid quarter horse thing and i got pics it was funny. He also juggled a box of tampons guess stuff you had to be there for. Well we went to go to Bulls Eye in St Louis, we got lost for 4 hours in bad parts of St Louis trying ot find the damn place. We finally found it right about the time we was going ot give up!!! Everyone got to shoot except me cause I'm not 21 ya whatever I had a hang over....shooting guns with a hang over is a bad idea anyway. After shooting we decided to go to the ZOO!!! It was awesome all except the fact that they close at 5 so that kinda sucked. But we had a lot of fun got to go to the monkey house and see the reptiles along with the cats so cool shit. Did some stupid shit while we was there but again I think its one of those you had to be there to laugh. After a long day in St Louis we went back to Debbies house in Wentzville where we watched the Exorcise:Begining, it's a pretty good made me jump like crazy. Around 11 me and Paul left to come back to Granite took us only like 45 minutes to that was good seein as it usually takes an hour or more. Well we got home and paul wanted to see his way around Granite so we drove around till 3:30 lookin at shit and came home. I showered and my mom and Paul talked told embarassing stuff ya know how it goes. At 6am mom went to bed and me and Paul went to get White Castles LOL I had a craving. We finally fell asleep around 7 hehe and woke up to Debbie callin us at 10 so that kinda sucked. 
On Sunday we had a BBQ it was yummy. Paul stayed for dinner and after we ate I took him to meet some of the peps (Jen, Em, Natty and Dave). I think they like him....Paul had ot leave around 8:30 to head back home so he could get some sleep before he had to get up at 4am so that was sad. I miss him bunches but he may come down this weekend yippy!!! So that was the just of my weekend"

"event","So I've done a few things while on spring break some good and some bad LOL. 
I've learned that you can't erase the past or let go of it easily. I'm just tired of DRAMA. Ever thought about just wanting to get up and go? Meet knew people, get away and be a little adventourous. I really hope this summer opens peoples minds and allows them to be less judgemental.....pondering
Anyway now that that's out of the way. Amber and Dave let me know if you're able to go with me May 28th or not? I need to make arrangements or what not cause weather I have a home to come home to or not I'm not falling through on this...

Just so you all know:
I've seriously decided upon helping out some guys in Iraq. Seems like their moral is falling by the minute especially while away on holidays. Therefore if you wanna pitch in and gather up somethings to send. Hit me up and let me know the guys are: Charles Duckworthy, KC Church and John Heck.
Duckworthy (Ducky) is 24 and from MO. He's got a g/f back that has a 3 yr old little girl and another on the way. They're talking marriage and with every 100 minute phone card they only get 10 minute calls home.
Church hell he went to Granite and played on the football team. Infact I went to him and his wifes baby shower before he was sent to Iraq. It was sudden for him and totally unexpected he misses Shenna and the baby.
Heck is a friend to Ducky and KC just talk to him ocassionaly and keeps everyone laughing and playing practical jokes. SO ya know if this is something that interests you let me know I'd appriciate it.

Well it's Easter Sunday and lets talk about the good stuff. Had a family gathering and we know how my family is so it was fun. Gabe came home for it and was a suprise to see him again after lying saying he can't make it and showing up at the house banging on my window to get inside at 4am the little shit.

Just want everyone to know that I love you and greatful for knowing you!! I love my friends and family"

So she had to leave...and I caleld Ryan while waiting for Buddy(my buddy) to call but he never did. butthead
Then Tuesday, Jenny came over againg and so did Srah, Buddy and the twins. We ate CHEESEBURGERS AND FRIES, YUMMY YUMMY!!! Ha Emmma, Jen and I played cinderella that was so damn funny, guess you had to be there type of things. Then I took pics of Emma with boobies, that was great. She went around saying she's got boobies as big as me and Jen everyone laughed. In one pic she's posing with her fake boobies and her ass hanging out, total diva. We all had a really good time. Then Jenny had to go home and I went and saw EMILY!! I missed her while she was gone and I got to hear some juicy stories but will hear the rest later.

Sorry if you're one of them I still love ya!!
   Anyway, Guth is back that makes for an interesting twist. It's been good seeing him. I'm proud of him, he's accomplished something not everyone can do. He looks good to, fat boy dropped some weight LOL (I don't mean that). I love him like a fat kid loves CHEESEBURGERS LOL. He loves moms cheeseburgers and fries let me tell ya. They stopped by today, hope him and some of the guys are having fun at WILD COUNTRY.
   I got Jake to sign papers for prom just need a copy of his ID...hopefully I'll get that tomorrow. Gotta buy tickets by Monday or Tuesday otherwise I'll be paying a 100 bucks to go to prom, that's crazy. Food aint that great, what the hell charge us an arm and a leg....shit TAKE MY EYE!!. JUST DON'T MAKE ME PAY A 100 BUCKS FOR PROM. Ohh I get to pick up my dress the 17th I'm excited....its so so pretty I got pics of it for who ever wants to see.

"event","Well I haven't posted in awhile, been nothing but school really so yeah that sucks. Anyway, had a really good weekend. Friday after school (which was a half day), I went with Beth P and Aaron to go order Beth's prom dress....it's so pretty. After ordering her dress we flipped threw books to look at purses, shoes and umm tuxes. Aaron wouldn't get into a dress, he sucks. But yeah there was girls from our school and from Edwardsville looking at dresses. HAHA blonde in the ugly green dress...we should've stayed to see it. Remember Aaron and Beth if we see anyone in those dresses what we gotta do!!After going to the dress shop Beth had some running to do and yeah Aaron got into trouble for driving her car...oh well who knew. So after we had Jack N the Box YUM YUM, she dropped me off at my house and her and Aaron left to go home. HMMM SHE GOT HURTED (WATCH THE BED POSTS)!!
Well later that night we went to Dennys. That was a lot of funny. We had a crowd like always....Shorty cussed out Ryan on the phone(shouldn't cuss at Shorty)

So yeah Saturday didn't do much of anything. I went over to my aunts and visited Emma and Alex, aww they're so cute. Later that night Jake came over and we hung out, he's so silly. I think I'm putting him in blue for prom, haven't decided yet. I don't think he cares, he's an easy goin person.

Well Sunday was an eventful night, had everyone at my house. Aaron, Shorty, Stacie and Jerry....DRAMA. Sorry guys hope everything mellows out...(I love you shorty) HA Shorty was showing butt crack, she got a tattoo. We all left to go to Denny's....well Shorty, Stacie, Jerry and I did. We met up with Mo, David, Justin Alex and everyone else. It was fun although we didn't stay as long as we usually do...some bitches stole our table and tried to copy off of us...they're group looked funny.

"event","So this weekend was a blast!!! Friday I didnt really do much besides go to school, I wasnt feeling the best got a head cold goin on. Then Saturday yup I went and got my prom dress, it's oh so pretty but you already knew about that. Saturday evening I had to go to my cousin Kenneth (Mike) band concert. It was really cool, they had the top 100 children from the Madison County play. Beth P's little sister Tiffany was in it I seen in the program. Well anyway, after that was when the real fun happened. I hung out with the usuals, well the ones that are most important. Which is Jen, Emily, Natalee, Jamie S, Shorty, Dave B, Alex, Justin, Jake and Brad... we missed the rest of our bunch!! We had fun and hung out at Natalee's house for awhile. Brad and Emily are so cute and so are Nat and Dave aww cupids little angels...LOL. Then after the group split up cause people ditched us for the (retarded) cough cough crowd and Brad and Emily wanted to be alone and Dave had to leave...the rest of us went back to my house. It was fun we hung out and chatted a bit and then the guys showed up cause we're BETTER then the other crowd!! But I had to kick them out after awhile cause I'm still under watch from that one incident. And well Sunday was basicly doing left over homework, yucky.
So yeah today is Valentines Day and it sucks. I don't want sweets of any sorts cause I orderd the dress and yeah watching everything now! All I want is flowers, really pretty flowers. But I dont see that happening cause such and such is an asshole and we're no longer talking. Well I'm going to go have a test to study for. I love you bunches...Happy Valentines Day"

"event","So I finally got my prom dress!! Go me, OMG IT'S SO SO PRETTY. I felt like a princess in it, totally. It's light blue with beading strapless...uh describing it doesn't do justice. You'll all have to wait till I get some pics in it. Like I said it's absolutely gorgeous and only cost $350.
Anyway, so tonight I'm going to see my cousin Mike, he's got a concert. Playing for the sympahny....should be a cool sight to see. When I get home I'll more then likely hang out with Jen and whoever else is around. Gotta call here when I return to Granite. Well I'm goin to get off here and do some stuff around the house. I'll post again later. Love you all!!"

Anyway, so this weekend I'm ""supposed"" to have a visitor, guess we'll see about that. Saturday I'm goin to order my prom dress and dads going with me. Hopefully he likes it, although still haven't decided whic one I'm getting. Guess I'll find out when I get there, I'm sure it'll all come down to which one I think is the prettiest rather then price. Besides I got a 10 percent off card and free alterations. So we shall see also me and mom can talk dad into anything with a little will power. LOL
Well I'm going to head off here still have some Lit and Society to finish up and study for my psychology test. Uh  school is a pain in the ass. I feel sorry for Zach he went and signed up for classes tonight, can you believe it he starts high school this fall!! Along with Natty, oh my....poor kiddos. Guess I cant say much I start college this fall, yucky!! Anyway, I'm off to study and get some sleep cause I'm TIRED!!"

"event","School! That's all I've been seeing lately, and it's getting rather old. I hate homework and seem to be getting TONS of it every night. but the pay off is good, I made decent grades on my tests....go me. And I graduate soon, MAY omg I can't wait. This summer is dedicated to me, all about me. No Books, No Work, Nothing but fun.

Anyway tonight was a good night...Sarah and Buddy and the twins came over for dinner along with Amy Rainwater. We all sat around talking and laughing like old times. Fun Stuff, they're totally ate up. Our inside jokes and sense of humors can be a bit twisted at times.

On to a happier not I heard from my friend today. He wont have internet service for awhile so I gotta keep contact with him through e-mail. Which isn't that bad as long as I hear from him now and again. He's such a sweetheart!! Anyway it's midnight and I have school tomorrow unless by some miracle there's a snow day. Oh lets wish!!"

"event","So last night was Amber King's 18th birthday. Mccousky and I went with her to Wild Country. We had a blast!! It was crowded with a lot of hot guys. I found me a hot bouncer but he's engaged...I know (tears).  His name is Chris and if you ever go out there he's the tall one that wears a red baseball cap, check him out LOL.
   Amber and I learned a few line dances, it was fun. There was a guy showing me steps, his names Phil!! Hopefully I'll bump into him again and learn a few more next time. Amber was picking up the dances pretty fast. Although she was more interested in Mccousky, who I may say are now a couple. Yup Amber and Dave...was kissin on the dance floor LOL. They're cute together.
   Anyway after being there for several hours we went to Denny's. No one was there cause you all suck, j/k. But we ended up home around 1:30 and I was up till 4 am talkin to my Jenny and a very sweet guy (aww soldiers are the best!)Jenny knows who I'm talkin about. Cheer up Jenny...Life is like a box of chocolate, never know what ya gonna get...Sorry had to. But I love you Jenny!!
   well I'm goin to get off here, I got a damn head cold. My nose is running like a faucet. I need to help mom with laundry and do some homework. Then it's off to watch the super bowl. Remember we want the Eagles to win, not the patriots....New England already won the world series not the super bowl too!!"

"event","Tonight was a fun and eventful night. So Mccousky decided to have a scavenger hunt. We all met up at Big Lots and broke up into 3 teams...Mccousky, Madison, Rigsby, Spic and some other kids on team CKY...Stacie, Dave, Beth and Ron where on team Balls...and of course Me, Shorty, Hasty and Amber where on team Sweet.
    The whole hunt consisted of a list from the Viva La Bam show. My team accomplished a lot. Talked to a foreign people that speak a different language, traded pants with a stranger (lol Amber and shorty)..Put Jake in make up, Shorty had sardines in her mouth, autographed a cow, etc. I must say the best was tagging cars, getting kidnapped and racing. Ha we tagged her car, should've gotten extra points for that. Oh and Beth P.we so had you in the trunk no way in hell could you get us guys in it...but good effort. Anyway our team came out on top with 895 points,  WE WON!!"

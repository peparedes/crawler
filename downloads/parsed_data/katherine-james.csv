However, while I sat with my boyfriend giving him moral support today, I was able to get my forum figured out and finally up and running.

Anyone between the ages of 18-40 is welcome to join.  Upon joining, you will be approved, and then you must put your birthdate in your profile.  I will know if you're lying!!

"event","The heat wave broke last night!  I was in Manhattan for a JOB INTERVIEW on the upper east side, and while I probably got it, it most likely won't work out (will explain below).  A lot of the side work I've been doing lately, has been freelance babysitting/nannying and I posted an ad on craigslist a week or so ago about being available full time/part time for it.  I got a bunch of emails in the last four days, which was exciting.

So I was coming back from my interview to my boyfriend's office, and it was just so hot.  I had to wait for him to let me in, and by the time we got upstairs, I was immensely thankful for the air conditioning. A half hour, 45 minutes later, we walked outside and it was COOL.  Not cold, but it was breezy and cool and COMFORTABLE.  Woohoo! It was also about to storm like whoa.  We finally hailed a cab but my legs got pelted with gravel/dirt when a HUGE gust of wind came, and I almost blew away, I swear it!

So, the interview went well, when the kid finally let her mother sit for five seconds.  It was the MOST demanding four and a half year old I have ever seen in my life...and I've seen a lot of four and a half year olds!  They are ""late in life parents"" - must have been in their late 40s at least.  Everytime the little girl said she wanted something, mom got up and got it.  If she asked the little girl to do something, she either wouldn't answer, or she'd say something else, or she'd get the look of satan on her face and answer very angrily.  And then she asked if I'd read to her, so I did.  We read Cinderella.  All of a sudden she got down off the bed and left the room...er...ok she brought back the cat.  Great, I'm allergic to cats in my lap.  The cat looked terrified of her and ran off.  She then wanted me to read another story (this one was a HUGE snow white book) and I said it was too long and picked up a pooh bear book.  After pouting and whining she finally started to listen to the book.  Then got off the bed without saying anything, mid book! and left.

That was that.  I found her in the hallway where she ripped off her plastic clip on earrings, and hurled them on the floor. Nice!  Mom put down dinner which she was making, and went and put them away.

So I'm not sure I'd like to be the one to teach little miss upper east side some manners with mom home.  Plus, the pay isn't that great and it's only 3 afternoons a week.  I'd do another job as well, but it's time in the middle of the day which would make it inconvenient.  OH and the father sat at his computer the whole time, barely speaking...hmm

Next interview tonight seems more promising - longer hours, one little girl, who knows :) Wish me luck around 7PM EST!

"event","Well, she's done it!  Clare Fonda has re-opened her Fem Dom website.  Wow, I am excited.  She's got a guy who shot for Kelly Payne last summer, on there, and he is just such a little painslut...he LOVED it.  He'd never done it before, but he loved it.  And he came back for more.  He isn't the only cute face on there. Legendary porn star Tom Byron, who recently shot a femdom video with Shadow Lane, also makes an appearance.  Talk about delicious.  The banner below takes you to a tour.  I HIGHLY recomend this.  All the content is great, and it's super high quality, and of course has all the humor any Clare Fonda site has.  It's called Clare Spanks Men but other women, including Chelsea Pfieffer, make appearances.

Well my lovely minions...I mean, fans, I am reaching out, to YOU for my next video jaunt.  Clare Fonda has invited me to LA for a steller weekend to shoot her amazing yearly film with a bunch of other girls (EE3 anyone?), as well as a few other things, including something possibly for her new website.

I want to go more than anything, it'll be almost exactly a year since I shot with her, and I haven't shot a video since I did for SIN, but before that, August!  Wow right?  The problem? Plane ticket :( I've got a few job interviews this week, but as you all know, living in NY isn't cheap.  I'll be put up while there, but need a way to get my pretty bum out there, you know what I'm sayin?  I would like a sponsor for a plane ticket to get out there so I can shoot.

A copy of the video, as soon as it's ready, will be yours to keep (signed by at least me...)

Send me an email at krjames@mac.com :)

Last night was my one year Paddles-Versary, meaning one year ago, this weekend, myself and a friend, Midnight Sky, huddled up in a hotel in midtown Manhattan, ready to reek havoc on the city.  We were attending our first OTK night, and her first public spanking event! Our friend SantaCruzChris joined us as well.  It was an awesome weekend, and here are some repost pictures from it.

:) Here ya go! Last night was the Monthly OTK night at Paddles Club here in NYC.  It takes place the first Saturday of the month and there is a munch beforehand at the Moonstruck Diner on the corner of 23rd and 9th.  We all gather in the back part of it and sit at a big long table.  Good food and good people.  They're run by a fine lady named Sinny.  Afterwards we all walk over to the club, it's just one big block and 3 short blocks away.  Although, it was so hot, that was enough to make you want to get inside.  Ladies get in free if you go to the munch, so if you live 'round here...you should go!

Anyway, the first gentleman to approach me was a nice guy who goes by MoviesBill.  He is super sweet and a good spanker.  So we wandered off to the back of the club and he gave me a nice spanking.  His spankings are never overly hard, and are just right.  They feel like a firm bum massage! :)  I hung around, being a brat with a nice boy (girl!) who has the largest collection of school boy uniforms I've ever seen.  He had peanut m&ms...and a sling shot! :)  I saw a good friend who pops up rarely and who I met at SL last summer and spent a lot of time with.  We didn't play but it was nice to catch up.

My nice big spanking of the evening came from someone new who joined my yahoo group.  We talked and he asked me to play.  I said yes and we went to one of two short hallways that has a chain to limit how close to crazies can get to the scene.  We talked and after deducing that stingy implements, such as a light Shadow Lane hairbrush were out of the question, he decided to just use his hand.  But boy oh boy did he ever use his hand.  He asked me to use yellow and red if I needed to, as he'd never spanked me before.  I used yellow once but really liked how he was a firm and hard spanker.  His hand was stingy at first and I yellowed once, but after that my bum got used to it.  He was thorough too.  My whole bum from the top to the tops of my thighs, was red!  Mmmm nice.

I got a water and some cheese doodles from the ""Whips and Licks Cafe"", sadly passing up the Frozwn Virgin Penis Colada and Frozen Pierced Nipple.  I chit chatted with Michael and Sinny for a while and then my bum said it was time to go home.

I stopped at the pharmacy to get some things I needed and looked for a trian, hopping on the R, I took it to 36th Street and changed to a D.  I walked home from the D because my normal N wasn't running, and a bunch of guys in a car were basically following me.  They kept pulling up and stopping, and making comments.  It was sort of very scary.

All in all, a good night.  My daddy got home super later (8 am!) as it was a night job last night.  We just snuggled a bit and he kissed the bruise I got because of him the other night.  He pulled me over his lap in the train station, and the benches have wooden dividers, and I banged my elbow on one.  Ouch! He said if I hadn't been misbehaving I wouldn't have banged my elbow.  A raspberry was all I had to say about that.

He reached next to our bed and got my birthday paddle - a frat style one made by a friend at Paddles and given to all the January birthday brats.  I HATE those style paddles.  Like, not quite a hard limit, but I don't let anyone spank me with them except Max, and the occassional very close friend spanker.  He pinned me down on our bed where we were snuggling and gave me six.  Oh man, my bum was still a bit sore from last night and I about hit the roof.  I even cried a little.

Daddy doesn't like raspberries!

"event","I am frustrated with so many things right now.

1. I feel like I've hit a wall with my job hunting.  I've applied just about everywhere I want to work, and everywhere else, I am not qualified for or they want someone with more experience.  I'm absolutely not wasting my time applying to places I don't want to work and know I would be miserable at - ie. Starbucks. Target. McDonalds.

2. Spanking companies don't even respond to my emails anymore, or they ask for pictures, and then don't respond again.  Like, I'm not even worthy of a response because well I'm not their ""body type"" or my body type isn't within their ""vision"" or whatever.

3. You probably think I get spanked all the time.  I don't.  Not even often.  Sure I get a couple cane strokes if I don't apply for jobs, but I don't get fun spankings all the time, and the canings are usually 2-6 strokes and fades within a few hours.  I'm not complaining, I hate the cane. But I just wish I could play more.  I miss it.

I guess that's my three biggest frustrations right now...

It stormed last night, and we're due more rain.  So today I've stayed in and been writing.  I've been working on spanking stories for the soc.sexuality.spanking Summer Short Story Contest.  It runs every summer on the SSS newsgroup.  If you don't use a newsreader, or know what Usenet is, go to google groups and type in spanking.  The rules, etc. are posted there.

Today I posted a new story called <a href = http://groups.google.com/group/soc.sexuality.spanking/browse_thread/thread/1ed944cb02836c1c/085bf719f57b3879?hl=en#085bf719f57b3879>The King and His Men</a>

On another note, Clare Fonda, my favorite video producer in the world, has had a new website for the last few months.  It's called My Spanking Roommate and it's a series site.

I am terrified.

Very scared.

Why?

It's quite simple really.

I have no job.  I haven't had a job since March 1st.  Wow.  I've been job hunting, applying, interviewing, etc.  For every single job I've applied for and interviewed for, I haven't even received a call to tell me I didn't get the job, and yet obviously I didn't get the job(s).  I went to Indiana to campaign for Barack Obama and that was cool.  I stayed with my boyfriends mom on the beautiful farm she grew up on.  I had a great time.  I even scheduled some job interviews for the day after I got back.  I had three, and heard nothing.

I had one evening babysitting job a week ago, but nothing since.  I hate not working.  I feel really terrible that my boyfriend is supporting both of us right now, I can't even support myself.  I feel inadequate and useless.  I've become depressed and sad.  I cry a lot.

Hence the new rule about applying for three jobs a day or else I get caned.  Today I have my three and I shall apply for them in person when we go out to dinner later on.  They're all within a block of each other too.  One is the place we're going to eat at.

Anyway, I'll start blogging more soon I think.

"event","So just when I was starting to think maybe my boyfriend isn't as much of a spanko as I thought...he surprises me.  I think about spanking a lot.  About as much as I think about eating, etc.  It's part of who I
am.  But sometimes I doubt that he does.  Probably because I am usually the one who initiates any play spankings.

Last night we got thai food and stopped at one of our favorite deli's for dessert. As we were standing on the corner waiting for the lightto change, he put his hand on my shoulder and said ""So, the best way I
can think of to help you on your job search, is this: Everyday you will apply for three jobs.  For every job you do NOT apply for, there will be two cane strokes.""

Jaw dropped.  All I was thinking was ""He came up with this all by himself?"" because we've always talked about rules and their punishments.  Not that I mind him coming up with them by himself, just was a little surprised and it came out of nowhere.  I express my displeasure in this new unfair rule.  I felt like he thought I wasn't trying (I've had three or four interviews since I got back from Indiana alone...).  Most of the jobs I apply for I never hear from again, and less ask for an interview.

I guess I'm off to start my hunting for the day.  Wish me luck, I don't want to have DETAILS!!! to post to you! Oh and he usually forgets stuff like this when he's on a big project so he said he's going to put it in his daily to do list!

Last night I got two cane strokes for one application not done.

This netring is run by Zoeymantis/zprymantis and her sidekick Steven.  We used to be friends but for a reason unknown to me, they've taken to malice.

Now, they have written three songs about me, claiming I created a sockpuppet to ""flame"" Zoey, made numerous posts attacking close friends of mine on a common/popular newsgroup, and have started playing dirty.

Anyone who has a link to their website or the netring will be deleted from my blogroll.  This is for my personal safety/privacy.

I want to send these people a message that this is not ok.  It is difficult to defend myself because of the attacks everytime I do.  These people are not ok.  They are not good people.  Help me send the message.  Check to see if your website is on this netring, if so ask that it be removed and remove the link from your website.

Join the site, watch the video, and seriously, let me know what you think.  Northern Spanking post will be separate so it's not too big.

"event","Well, I am going to San Francisco for the week! My boyfriend and I are going to visit our very dear friend Bella.  We leave tomorrow morning and fly home next Monday night.  I will have both my point and shoot and my nice digital camera with me so I will take lots of pictures.

I've been in a little funk lately, job hunting and such and not really wanting to be around people.  I'm ok just not in a blogging mood.

Here are some pictures, some old, some taken last night with my iSight because I got bored...

"event","Well, I decided to make it a week hiatus.  I've had so many ideas in the last week to blog about, and greatly miss writing things down in this journal.

So I am back.  And I am still waiting for those sessions to come in.  I had someone cancel last night because of NY's amazing Eliot Spitzer.

Now, first of all, THIS. IS. NOT. SEX.

The service you're paying me for is not sexual in any way.  If you jack off when I leave, that's your own choice.  You are not paying me for a directly sexual service, so legally, you have no issue.

If you're just getting cold feet about the session, don't worry, we're meeting at Starbucks beforehand anyway.

I realize I may have come off strongly in my last post about sessions, but I was very frustrated by people emailing me with assumptions and attitude.

I want to have fun.  I greatly enjoy being spanked by new people, I am a bit of an exhibitionist.  I like to meet new people and do new things and act out new role-plays.  I'm super laid back and fun as long as you're not an idiot.  So what are you waiting for?  Email me and we can talk about your fantasy/role play and how we can make it happen.  Did I mention I love to dress up?

Oh, and while I hate asking people for money, I realized recently that keeping my website up is getting expensive, so any help would be greatly appreciated! Donate to my website, www.evanescently.com by clicking the paypal button below :) I'd be forever thankful to you for helping me out.

Recently I've been targeted by some people for doing something I didn't do.  And you know, if it was me, I would 100% understand their retaliation and expect it, but sadly, there is no way to prove that I didn't, and because they seem to get their ammunition via this blog, and I need some time to work on me, I am stepping away.  This isn't easy.  I finally found the one area of my life where the majority of people don't dislike me (although maybe that's not true, regardless, it's entirely my fault).  Not to mention the recent threat from someone to out me, my last name, phone number, and school, to an entire chat room.

I will come back eventually, and if it's not on April 1st, then just bare with me, as I need some time.  Commenting on this entry will be left open.  And I can be reached via e-mail.

This first photoset has me as the naughty niece staying with my Auntie Lucy.  Instead of sleeping, I resort to singing and making noise.  It was a lot of fun and I look like a goofball, but I enjoy having fun and being playful on shoots.  The more laughter, the better!  She isn't too happy about it as she wants her beauty sleep.

"event","About sessions.

Leighton and I are bottoms.  So is Chrissy.  I classify myself as a bottom. Leighton sometimes relates to being a submissive and sometimes a bottom.  Chrissy is a submissive.  She had a Dom.

If you email me commenting on my attitude, non-submissive demeaner, and lack of respect, I will go off on you.  We are bottoms/submissives but in our day-to-day, vanilla lives, we are well respected and hard working women and expected to be treated as such.  If we choose to give you the gift of our submission/access to our round bums for you to spank till your hearts content, you should not be pompus about it.

If you prefer a switch, look elseware.  If you want to do a session with me but think I am not submissive enough, tough luck huh?  We make it very clear what we are doing here, what we will do, and how we'll do it, and if that's not what you're looking for, then it's time to continue your search.

If however, you're interested in some very intelligent, educated, well read, funny, and cute young ladies to spend some time with, by all means, email away!

Please note, all emails - including those involving sessions with Leighton and Chrissy will go through me.  There are people (tall, large, male, protective) who are aware of these sessions and do encourage a strict screening process.  Once you've convinced me (via email) that you are a normal human being, it will be forwarded to the other girl who you've requested (if at all) and then we go from there.

I hate to have to sound so very...Domina.  But I'm tired of one line emails ""hey how can i contact you"" (Uh, email me more than one line) and ""do you switch?"" (No, where does it say we switch?).  I am going to have both Leighton and Chrissy write something up about themselves which I will post soon on my website <a href = http://www.evanescently.com/>Evanescently Spanking</a>

On that note, we're really eager to do more sessions, so please please please email us if you'd like a cute young girl to spank!

Oh and if you ever want a custom photoset in the outfit of your choice, let me know!  Simply send me the outfit, and I'll send you a disc with the photos!

"event","Sometimes, I have to ask myself, ""Kate, how is it that you have the to say awful things at times, and yet, still be so nice?""

Here's the way I see it - I was raised by a very angry, controlling woman.  I always had to defend myself.  ""You're making excuses"" you may say.  And I say ""No, I'm not.  I'm not excusing my behavior, or justifying it.  I am working out in my mind, what it is that makes me this way. So I can work on changing it.""

Until I got into HS I had no real influential adults except my mom.  Everyone knows, learned behavior from a parent, is very difficult to unlearn, especially at the age of 15.  I didn't really have an environment that was any different from that, to teach me otherwise.  Until I left for college.  And then the learning began.

I began analyzing my own behavior, trying to figure out why I am the way I am.  I have a nasty temper, and a short fuse.  I am a lot better about keeping it in check than I used to, but I am still working on it.  Having someone as calm and patient as my boyfriend around, helps a ton.  Him being so calm, makes me calm because I don't want to be the one to stir the mud into the water.  I'd rather everything stay calm, because I am happier when it's calm.  I didn't know I was happier when it was calm until I experienced calm.It

I don't feel good about myself when I am angry, when I allow my temper to control my reactions.  It's almost like, once I am angry, the choices I make aren't mine.  And once I have time to think, I feel like a horrible person.  Not knowing how to undo the did, forces me to simply move on, pretend it never happened and pray no one brings it up, and if they do, either ignore it, get upset, or pretend they didn't.


When I'm feeling attacked, or insulted, I am quite quick to defend myself.  Why? Because my entire life I had to emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically, defend myself against something who made sure I knew was bigger, older, and stronger.

People who take a chance and get to know me, are most often pleasantly surprised.  My boyfriend was.  He is 32 years old.  About 13 years older than me.  He doesn't like my temper.  Very rarely does he see much of it, because like I said, his calmness really effects me.  When I am around calm people, I am generally calm.  But when people a) expect me to lose my temper or b) have a crazy energy, my mind just kind of gives way.  If my boyfriend, someone, who in the scene, is very much liked by those who know him, as well as out of the scene, highly respect in his work, etc. doesn't think I'm a stupid immature teenager who needs to get a life, then why should I bother with people who don't know me, thinking that?  I may be biased because I love him, but he's an intelligent, wise, and well educated man whom I trust.

When people use my age (For the record, I am 19, not 18.) as an excuse it bothers me.  I've never used my age (even when I was a teenager) as an excuse for doing something stupid, make a mistake, etc.  Age is only what you make it, and right now, it means nothing to me.

I've been through more in the last 19 years than most 40 year olds.  And that's ok.  In life, we're only given what we can handle.  What I've been through has made me the person I am today.  Yes, it has also blessed me with my temper.  This post isn't meant really for anyone, just to help me work things out in my head.  Feel free to comment if you want, but keep it nice.  This post isn't arrogant or snide, it's thoughtful and something I wrote for myself.  I am simply sharing it.

If I get nasty comments, I'll turn it friends only.  The post below, has not been deleted, but made friends only.  Simply add me to your LJ and I'll add you back, then you can see friends only posts.

"event","Well, Leighton and I have some pictures from a session to share. I will post them in a minute, but first, I'd like to introduce you all to Christine McKenna.  Chrissy is a soon to be 20 year old submissive here in NY.  I also met her at Paddles.  I've spent a lot of time in the last few weeks getting to know her and her Dom.  Chrissy wants to do sessions.  Who wants to spank her? :)

Due to safety reasons, neither Leighton or Chrissy are available for a 1-2-1 scene.  If you'd prefer to spank one of them alone, I must be there still, and there is a fee.  Otherwise, you're stuck with myself, and one of them - or dare I say it...both?!  Who wouldn't want to spank three ADORABLE 19/20 year olds. Chrissy is adorable and can take a lot.  I've even spanked her, and I must say, she has a magnificent bottom.  Soft and round.

Just send me an email at krjames@mac.com and specify that you want a scene with us.

NOTE: Sessions MUST take place in NYC or one of the five NYC boroughs - Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Long Island.  They MUST NOT take place at your home/apartment.  They MUST take place at a hotel - stressing HOTEL, not MOTEL, and Comfort Inn, Days Inn, does NOT COUNT.  We are young women and should feel safe.  Upon making the session and checking into your hotel, you must provide your REAL NAME, hotel room number, and phone number in an email.  I will call the hotel, asking to be connected to you, and I will use the name you give me.  If you give me a fake name I will know.

We will then meet at a Starbucks where you will show me your photo ID (passports OK).  If the name on the ID differs significantly (not a nickname like John or something for Johnathon) then there will be no meeting.  No session is guaranteed until the end.  We can and will stop any session at any time if we feel unsafe, etc.  Safewords are a MUST!  Our cell phones will not be turned off and we will need to make a check in call/text at the midway point of your session (30 min if hour, hour if two).

If you don't like this, then you don't need a session :)  There are two very Dominant and formidable men who will know exactly where we are, who we are with and what we are doing.  They will know your name and where to find you should you do something you shouldn't do. :)

Enjoy :)

Well Chrissy, it looks like your rubbing that bum of yours! Hm I wonder what just happened!!

"event","Sorry I haven't been posting much.  On Tuesday I sprained my ankle during a part of my job...but mostly slipped and missed a step on the wet steps outside our apartment.  Ouch.  Went to the ER, got xrays, an ace bandage, and a script for motrin.  It didn't help.

Skip to today...

I went back to the ER last night because the pain in my entire body was unbearable. I'm usually ok with such injuries, because I am used to them frm playing soccer, but I was just crying, and my throat was sore and I had a headache. The Motrin wasn't working and my job kept me busy which was bad.

So I get there and we finally find triage and get me checked in. God my boyfriend was great. I am really a baby at ERs, no matter why I'm there, and I nearly passed out...and threw up. He got a nurse right away who got me a bed...and a basin...and cold water...and then the doctor came and said ""She's fine she doesn't need a bed""

I didn't like this guy.

He was cute, but that's about all he had goin for him.

He talked loudly, so, crying, I asked if he could not talk so loudly because my head hurt, he said ""Sorry this is how I talk.""

And told me all about sprains, strains, and bone contusions...ermmm red cross certified anyone? I was like ""Yes, I am almost a first responder, I played soccer, I know what a fucking sprain is"" and sensing my painful frustrations my boyfriend said, almost word for word ""So doc is there anything you can do, because we know all of that"" and he said no!!

Bloody idiot. I said I want something stronger. So he said he'd put me on vicoprofin...Motrin and vicodin together...ok! Sounds great, go get it and let me leave. I'm hungry and have a tummy ache because of it.

He went on and on about what the different meds do (LIke I fuckin cared). He didn't listen to me much about the concerns about my ankle, having had so many problems with it.

He was not a good doctor! So finally he gives me two percocet in the ER (whoa baby!) and a script for vicodin.

By the time I was leaving the ER, I was feeling a little better. Because I need to stay off it and my muscles hurt so bad, I can't use the crutches, he gave me a cane hahaha.

So improper use of my cane, will result in what? Probably a caning...with my boyfriends cane...

Anyway, so within 40 minutes of taking those babies I was out and feeling no pain, but it made me feel funny in the head lol. And when I was just falling asleep, I couldn't lift my body haha

Now, when the pharmacy finally opens...I'll get my vicodin script. Because....well...Percocet wears off after a while! I was a little surprised, took it at 11:30 and woke up at 6:30 feeling like it had worn off. But I guess that is 7 hours...damn pharmacies...9 am!

~~

I got the vicodin and it didn't work as quickly or efficiently as the percocet.  But it did make me just as sick.  I fell asleep around 7pm after resting in our bed most of the day, and woke up at 9, feeling much much better.  I ordered a cheese burger and enjoyed food for the first time since lunch yesterday.

I feel tons better.  Just have a yucky sore throat to deal with now.  The swelling has even gone down :)

Normally I am only available on weekends and evenings, and for most who travel for business, this isn't convenient.  If you're going to be in the NYC area, including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, or NJ, I am available for a paid, 1-2-1 spanking session.

All the details for my sessions can be found on my website <a href = http://www.evanescently.com>Evanescently Spanking</a>

If you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment, please contact me! I can do two sessions per day that I am available, depending on the severity of the scene.  I reply to all emails in a timely fashion, usually immediately upon receiving them.  If you'd like to chat more about a scene, email me and we can set up a time to talk on the phone if you'd like.

"event","Well, Northern Spanking has done it again.  They've released another excellent quality video with a most spankable young lady....oh wait...haha that's me! :) That's right!  My second ever video on NSI has been released.  Released on Jan 26th, 2008, this video stars myself and Stephen Lewis (my second fave male top to work with at Northern).  This is a very unique video though, and I highly recommend you see it.  Many websites claim to have ""real punishments"" and while some sites do offer the occasional real punishment spanking of a girl for a real infraction, I can honestly say, this is a 100% real spanking...that just happened to be filmed.

From the time I started talking to Lucy and Paul they counted every cuss word.  Oh shit...I mean crap...I mean...oh poop!  Right?! Well it's a good thing they weren't around me full time!  By the end the total was 64!  So I put on a cute outfit (adorable isn't it?) and grabbed my hairbrush, knowing what was expected of me.  The pictures below are just a taste.  But seriously, you must must must join to see this video.  Out of all my videos released, this is BY FAR, my favorite.  I think the only other one in the running for favorite is the Brady Brats one I did with Niki Flynn (cherished time working with her, she's amazing) but it hasn't been released yet so I'll have to keep quiet about it!

First of all, here is a little banner to let you all know how to get in touch with us regarding private sessions.  These are paid.  Do not contact me saying you'd love to play with me sometime, when can we meet.  Scene, fee, and location will all be discussed beforehand.

From the first session we ever did together....location? Trump International Hotel.  Sweeeet.  The guy was wonderful, a perfect gentleman, handsome, and an excellent spanker.  We both got the exact same spanking - hard hand spanking first.  Hairbrushing next.  Paddling after that (with one of those rice paddles FROM Japan), and then the tawse - authentic school tawse he won in an auction! Ouch! Bloody hurt, it did! And finally...dun dun dun...the cane.  6 of the best from our Swedish disciplinarian.  Ooooo ouch.  Don't be fooled, my bum was very sore and had some slight bruising the next day!  Poor Leighton though, her bum wasn't used to the tawse...no, they aren't cane marks.  Those are from the very well worn in flexible tawse he used.

I shall post them soon.  I start a new job on the 21st, and while I can't say what it is, I get to do something I love, and make mucho dinero doing it.  TOmorrow I am going to the gym with my radically awesome new friend, Leighton.  Oh by the way, want a double scene?

Why? Because anyone who uses the word ""c***"" on my blog, doesn't deserve my attention.  That is a vulgar inappropriate and disgusting term and I do not approve of it, especially on my blog. You are not welcome here.  I do not need you as a reader.  Your comments from now on will be deleted. Unfortunately I cannot ban people entirely from my blog, so I'll settle for reporting you to LJ if you continue to post such things,

And FYI - I do not write about sex, or kinky sex.  MY blog covers MY life on a journy into exploring this ""fetish"" of spanking.  Never do I talk about my personal sex life or others sex lives.  I do not discuss sex on this blog.  It's for ME to write about MY life.

If you don't like it, then don't read it.  Because I don't give a damn if my everyday life bores you.  Spanking models have more in their heads than you obviously think.

While I am extremely happy with my life right now, may I just, for a moment, be a selfish bitch?

I got a toaster for Christmas.  I am about to turn 19 and I got a toaster for Christmas.

Fucking hell.

I should be getting PS2 games, cool clothes (which I could use some of right now...not even cool ones...but jeans would be nice), fun DVDs, etc. etc.

I love getting things I need - socks, etc. because they're things that I need but who wants to go buy socks? Getting them for Christmas is nicer.

Someone pointed out that ""You wanted to be an adult. You can't have your cake and eat it too.""

And why not?  If being an adult means not having fun, fuck it, I'd rather be a spoiled annoying 18 year old.

But no, being an adult IS fun.  At least for me it is.  Making choices, etc.

And no, I didn't want to be an adult. I had no choice.  And I don't want to hear YOUR fucking sob story.  I've got enough of my own problems without you saying ""You know, I had to walk three miles up hill both ways in the snow, all year round to get to school""

Big fucking deal.  My father killed himself when I was 13, my mother cut me off at 16 and made me even feel guilty for living in *her* home, and eating *her* food.  At 16, I was not an adult. I was a child.

Sure I was mature, but 16 is a teenager.

And teenagers, do not NEED that.  They've got enough to worry about as far as school, after school activities, and friends go.  Parents are supposed to nurture and support and help through those rough times.  Not kick you out on your ass and say ""Go be an adult.  I had it rough at 16, so should you.""

You should want your kids to have it easier than for you.

So for the first time, that I can remember, no, I am NOT happy with what I got for Christmas....who gets hot chocolate for Christmas...aside from an extra little ""I know how much you like hot chocolate with marshmallows"" gift.

Does it sound selfish? Yeah a little, and I feel really awful for feeling that way, but it's how I feel right now.  Like my mom doesn't give a fuck and it pisses me off that when I am at her house she still has this control through very small actions, to emotionally kill me."

Oh and I am currently in the market for new panties.  So many pairs of mine have been featured in videos, that well, I need some new ones!!!

Want to buy me panties? Ok, you can! :)

E-mail me for the address.  I'll take a picture of me wearing them for you. I like all colors and styles, so send em along!

Usually a L or XL in most styles, but some, including some Victoria's Secret, a M.

with slightly puffy sleeves.  It's a size medium.

Price: 7 dollars

<B>VINTAGE, BOHO, HIPPIE TOP!</B>

This is, I'm assuming, a somewhat vintage item.  It is handmade and very delicate.  The fabric is nearly sheer so you'd probablly have to wear something under it. It's about a size medium or large, but these kinds of shirts are sort of one size for all.

Price: 5 dollars
Size: One size for all

<B>SHORTSLEEVED, VINTAGE, INDIE, ROCKABILLY DRESS</B>

This is a vintage, 1970's dress.  It's in great condition the only problem is that the tag is ripped out so I'm not sure about the size, but it doesn't fit me too well and I usually wear a m/l so it's probablly about a small or medium.

Price: 10 dollars
Size: Small-Medium

<B>VINTAGE, TANK TOP, SUMMER DRESS!</B>

This is another vintage dress from the 70's.  It has an elastic bossom area that is not for the large chested and all though the camera didn't show it too well but the color is purple with little white tulips.  It's a size small.

Price: 7 dollars
Size: Small

This is a cute little shirt that has NEVER been worn, still with tags.  It's an asian styled shirt, look at the second picture to see the actual colors. Size is a Medium (stretchy) could probablly fit a small though.

Price: 6 dollars
Size: Medium

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icing_sugar/asianshirt.jpg"">


This shirt is handmade and vintage LOOKING, but I don't think it's really that old.  It's mostly pink with flowers.  ALthough this style is pretty one size for all, this shirt is kinda large so I'd say it might be for a medium to XL

Price: 5 dollars
Size: Baggy Medium to Tight XL

This is a relaly cute red and white stripped shirt.  It's off the shoulders and 3/4 length sleeves.  It's a very little LARGE, so it's more for a medium or small.

Price: 7 dollars
Size: Fits Small to Medium
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/1003/icing_sugar/redwhitestripped.jpg"">

Here's another very stylish little shirt.  It's a purple tank with beading and sprakle on the edges of the collar and arms.  It's a size Medium, and I think it's only been worn a few times, if ever.

Price: 6 dollars
Size: Medium

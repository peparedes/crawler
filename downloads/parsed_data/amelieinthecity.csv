"event","Coming off down from you
I plummeted into the darkest abyss
wishing I could make the smile
not look so painful on your 
furrowed brow and paling 
fragmented face.
Too oft have I seen my
reflection in your posture
Lurking through the shadows
of a city we moved to 
Seeking ourselves in the sunlight
Finding the outline in the bottom of the
bottle. 
I came down from you in a haze
the ceiling still 
spinning
Your melody still plucking
away inside an empty
cave,
Can you hear yourself?
Tonight the black night sky
wraps me like the
blanket of sincerity
because it promises
the things you never will."

"event","Tonight I reached out
and like a ragged branch
tap my limb upon your heart
to say 
Hello again.
I thought we'd given up
on uniting these
elements of 
Human and Heart
but somehow
the wind has swept them down
the drainpipe again.
Hello again
I'd say
to you silently smirking back
guitar in grasp
And inside
I find a hollow
even you could never fill.
Hello again I said
and leapt off into
the darkness
of my 
demise. 
Into the blackness you weakly 
questioned,
""Hello?""."

I'm kinda glad that i might be moving next year, it will be a new start. But idk if my parents are willing to go through with it. I guess i'm staying in seguin for the rest of my high school education. I've actually been thinking about where i want to attend college, and prom and when I get my own apartment. It's kinda early for me to be thinking about all this but, hey....whatever.

You just don't know the half of it.
I'm tired, and i'm sick of this town!
We should have moved when we had the chance!

I would have been better off, with a lot more better people.
I hate almost everyone here, and almsot everyone here hates me.
dumbfucks.
I don't care, but they are fucking stupid and take shit to hard.
Who else is supposed to tell them something.
Seriously get a life.

"event","<center>Rachel & I conceived two children that were made out of bottles and fabric! How exciting right?!

:|

My day was extremely tough i don't know why. My body was aching all over, especially my thighs! It was a weird feeling they don't hurt that much anymore. So the only class i'm going to fail this 6 weeks is Biology, Chemistry was so much easier D:.

Tomorrow i'm going over to emily's house to watch KIDS! She said there's A LOT of sex in it, but other than that it's a good movie, well that is what she told me! If it turns out to be child porn, i'm calling the cops on her! Because i love her that much<3 ha.
Geez, i was just so angry today as well. I hate that i'm the only one that does their work! [Well most clases] And the everyone just looks at my paper, as if i LET them see what i put down! So today i decided to hide my assignment under the book and not do the second half of it...

"event","<center>I'm just so tired of everything, like literally i've been so tired to do anything! Even in the mornings i can't stay awake, in all my classes i have to at least put my head down for a second, or two. But then when i get in the bed i can't sleep at all! I turn off my tv, turn away from it, and close my eyes. But i end up getting so bored of waiting, that i turn my tv back on and watch the latest info-mercials! I used to take my moms sleeping pills, but i used them all up.....
Either that or my mom thinks i'm a junkie! 

But back to the point! I feel like myself and a few others are the only sane ones! Everyone else has just gone INSANE! But i'm glad i'm not alone on this situation!
geez."

Today was unusually good, i spent it with my sister's and mom. We went all over, and spent some money well they did. I just got some new shoes, since the shoes i had EVERYONE had. So it's all good now! School is just bothering me such much, i'm missing so much work from Biology and Geometry! I'm such a procrastinator, :|. I think i've met someone that will become something more of a friend. thgitsalmakacitsnorrewew....But i don't think i would want to get with him, since he's yeah....idk.

Probably today, i am going to pierce it since i didn't go out of town with my dad!
I talked with some girl on myspace, who had just done hers! She said it doesn't hurt all that much, but she had gone to a show and got hit in the nose! And it hurt like a bitch...so idk.
I'm going to have to stay away from shows then...."

Run as fast as i could....or just pack a back pack full of clothes. And just walk out of my house at night, while my parents are sleeping. This just seems so easy to me, but i still have not given in to it....


But sunday, was boring [as usual]. Today was also boring....
The only think i liked, was how cute my 3 year old cousin bengerman is. Whenever i have a kid, i want i him/her to be as cute as he was.

I always tell myself, that i'm going to start updating this journal more frequently but i never get to it.

I'm pretty tired and just pissed off at the world today, i'm sorry in advanced.

I have to attend summer school, it's a drag for the past two days. We sit on a cold seat for 4 hours straight, we get a 30 minute break at 10. But they serve drinks and cookies, ha! I was like what, am I twelve. But the cookies, are really delicious :DD.

There has been quite some conflict :/, not all that good. But people have pissing me off. It's just a matter of time, that it will all end. 

I need some money for the following, haha.
-Warped Tour Tickets
-FFTL Tickets
-Disco Blood Bath/ Party Monster Novel.

They said that the Party Monster book, is WAAAY better than the movie. So i saw it at the local Hastings :DD.
It is 13 dollars, :/.
I only had like 10, so i was out of luck, or and even better idea. Someone let me borrow it :DD

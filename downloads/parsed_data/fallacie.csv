I've put severe restrictions on it because I DON'T condone the site whatsoever, but my girls told me the other day that one of my bestest friends when we raved had contacted her to contact me.  So that was the final straw.

"event","BORDERS:
It's goin well; I've been in the coffee biz for nearly six years now, so nothing really surprises or challenges me anymore.  This job seems comparable to the other ones I've had and I realized today that the only reason I stayed at Starbucks as long as I did is I: was comfortable, didn't think I could transition to another job and I used the benefits.  I realized that this job has adequate pay, offers benefits, has a more attractive set-up for promotion and it's closer to home.  Hopefully this will become my job niche when and while I get back to school.

CRAZY:
I've begun taking my meds on a regular basis and so-far I can't complain.  My head's still a bit of a mess, but my sleeping is somewhat in-check *knocks on wood* and in a matter of weeks I should be on a health plan where I can begin seeing my counselor again.  Whew.

PROJECT RUNWAY:
What more needs to be said?  Like an old woman and her cats, this is THE best thing that's happened to me in YEARS!  Oh how sad.  But I HEART it and what better catalyst for bringing people together?  However...
I hear I'm going to be skipping this upcoming week's episode to go to RPlace?  Hmmmm, for reasons I'll let play out on their own.  All that needs to be said is this ""reason"" is so fuckin important that I'm gonna miss my ""stories.""  Hahaha, I can't wait to be old and fat and not care anymore!

FAT:
I'm gaining weight (not surprisingly) and although it does worry me, I'm not going to do anything about it for the time being.  For the first time in my LIFE I'm okay moving forward with no plan in-place for slimming down again.  Now, if I begin to sail the seas without a raft and relying upon my blubber for survival, THEN any ONE of you can hunt me.
But for now, I'm not worrying about it too much.  Besides, I look good in black~

"event","UPPER: I GOT A JOB AT BORDERS!  I've applied there at least four times this year, and for those of you unfamiliar with the process, you must fill out an on-line application and take their personality test that consists of 150 questions.  This time around, I got a call-back, had the interview and I start tomorrow!  This is the ideal job for me because I'm in-school and not seeking a career.  I just want a job I can do well.  This is in the cafe with potential to move into the book part of the company.  I'm UBER excited!

DOWNER: Par-for-the-course, it's summer and therefore my mind feels it time to not cooperate.  Thus, I haven't been able to sleep well for the past couple weeks.  For some reason I've developed this ""complex"" where I'm somewhat afraid to fall asleep because I'll be unconscious.  I know, it sounds quite odd and I don't doubt that it is.  However, when you live with an anxiety disorder and are not taking all the meds you should (thank for firing me, Starbucks, so I don't have the benefits any longer to support myself), not everything goes right.  SO, hopefully when I get benefits again (Borders offer them, I'm just not sure yet how long it will be until I'm eligible) I can get back into counseling and get back on a regular track of meds.

Otherwise, life is life for the moment.  I have the opportunity to move into this AWESOME apartment in August with a dear girl I used to work with at Starbucks.  I need to figure out, tho, how my mom will cope with that.  Right now I'm living with her, at her request, because she's fallen on hard times financially and needs assistance with paying bills and such.  BUT, I would like to be on my own again and could support myself with this new job and such.  We'll see what happens.

But I'm ecstatic with this chance to work for Borders and for the next two weeks will have two jobs.  HooRAY!  Woot woot for the discount on books and DVD's too!

He hadn't been eating last week so I took him into the vet and it turns out he had six absessed teeth!  Poor guy was pussing so much he couldn't eat!  So $700 later he had eight teeth extracted and he's lost like FIVE pounds!  Before you rush to judge, keep in-mind that he's already 18 pounds and cat weight is unlike human weight; he has lost over 25% of his body weight!  Poor guy has random bald spots where he had to have IV's and such.

But I love him and me being particularly broke is SO worth it to have him alive.  We all know he's my boy, my kid.  Hey, because of HIM I don't feel to need to overpopulate to world!

So yes, that was adventurous as well.

"event","So I am QUITE proud of myself and those I ventured around with this past Pride weekend!  Compared to last year, this annual event was QUITE well-behaved and I remember all of it (well, MOST parts, which should account for something, right?)!

Friday night I went out in Tacoma and had some fun, only to wake up slightly drunken and head up to Seattle where I met up with Dee and Kyle to watch the mini-parade up on Capitol Hill.  Ran into Brett and his new boytoy and his mom!  His mother is adorable, and I feel we all had a good job as spectators.  But that's when things started to accelerate at a dizzying pace...

I had SOME vodka at the parade, though not much.  But then we met up with Brandon and Kyle's friend from Detroit (it's always fun to reminisce with someone from Michigan), so we paraded ourselves back to Dee's pad where we got TANKED.  I guess I passed out around 9 but then was shaken awake and, well, we all know I'm game to head out after a loose snooze.  So I jumped up and we headed out.  Thankfully my keepers felt it a good idea for me to try and eat something to sponge up the food within me so we ate at that pizza place across from RPlace then proceded onto Manray.  Not a good idea for me; somehow I got confused and had a Twin Peaks experience, so Dee had to take me back to his pad and put me to bed.  Sad.  For.  Me.

Sunday was fun!  We had a party of like 10 at the Spitfire Grill and it was so uplifting to catch up with Jesse, Robby, LaKia (sp?) and meet some new people!  The parade was fabulous and Seattle Center was even BETTUH!  Wow I had so much fun basking in the sun and doing laps around the fountain, pausing at times to sit and take in the view or just admire the somewhat utopian atmosphere where everyone from all backgrounds could get together and do what they wanted to have fun.  *Sighs* Nowhere else around here will you ever see that.

Sunday night I walked around with Dee and our new friend, Christian.  Apparently he's from the South end as well, but I'd never met him before even though we somewhat recognized each other.  It was fun to walk around and turn him onto Project Runway (another one succumbs to its seduction!), but when it came time for everyone to go out at like 11pm, we were all crashed out!

So leave it to me to extend Pride into Monday when I got back to Tacoma.  Xan knew I was broke so he offered to take me out to dinner so we had Azteca but didn't wanna go home afterward.  Thus, we went down to the Silverstone and started puttin em down.  We formed a small group of fags and played pool then went back to an apartment and played Kings and proceded to get just WHACKED.  I stumbled home around 8am and crashed out till 1 when I got up to go to work.  Talk about feeling GROSS.  That was my Tuesday.

But now it's nearly Thursday and I have yet to really feel like the weekend is over.  Oh, but I bought Project Runway Season 2!  And the third season premieres in two weeks!

Oh yeah, and if ya haven't already, buy/listen to the new Nelly Furtado CD.  *Sings* It's LOVerly!

And now I'm getting gonnorhea in my throat from some cold I got from a sniveling lil chick at work.

HISTORY:

I got a 2.5 in my media class this past quarter, WELL below my 3.65 average I've maintained thus far at UWT.  I am QUITE upset at this, though I do know where I went wrong.  I had to withdraw from my statistics class this summer because the funding for school is NOT there.  But in the Autumn I am taking a TV Writing Criticsm course as well as one in Human Sexuality, which I am EXCITED to take.

Work is fine.  For me it's just another job for the summer; easy, second-nature and I work with some funny chicks!


Pride is this weekend and I am going to get kuh-rayzee!  Not like last year, however (I STILL get drunk just REMEMBERING the debauchery), so I'll be up in Seattle Saturday afternoon'ish and meet up with Kyle and Dee and take things from there.  I'm stayin till Monday afternoon, so I'm more-than-willing to hop like a tick onto plans and have some unadulterated gay fun.  How gay was that statement?

And now it's mind-first into a new summer.  The housing situation is up-in-the-air, my job is up-in-the-air, I'm taking a statistics class and ultimately seeking to satisfy the feigning within to take advantage of this rare dead air to see people I miss.

"event","So I haven't written in this thing for a few weeks.  A call from Zac last night reminded me that I hadn't, for he hasn't either.  As crazy as May has been, it's winding down a wee bit, save for a massive project I have to do for my media class.  The subject was chosen by me and the only guideline was that it had to be newsworthy.

So I chose the reinvention of downtown Tacoma, focusing on the restaurant industry.  I've been putting off setting up interviews with anyone in management at the Harmon and Indochine so I can compare old vs. new.  I hate the actual process of setting up interviews, but I must admit that sitting down and interviewing people with a tape recorder and then enduring the tedious process of transcribing the information is quite fun and fulfilling for me.  It's all the technicalities in preparing for the interview that I loathe.

In other news, I attended the SIFF on Friday night and saw Boy Culture.  Decent movie that got better as it progressed, yet still a bit jumbled to guarantee my total satisfaction.  Briefly met the director at Chop Suey afterward, though; very nice gentleman.  I'm planning on buying a student pass ($35 for any five films; awesome!) and seeing the movies over the course of the next three Fridays.

I'm done with newspaper for the quarter and the experience, although brief, was wonderful.  I got my feet wet and gained a watchful eye for my areas of improvement: formulating insightful and influential questions and starting the assignment EARLY!  Too often interviews fell through because I didn't take into account how long it takes to actually set UP the interview with someone when I have a deadline.  Overall it's a taste of what I want to pursue as a career, as the defining area for the rest of my life.  And I got paid to do it.

Musically, I've been sporadically downloading anonymous stuff.  If you haven't checked out Gabriel & Dresden as I instructed a couple months ago, GO DO IT!  Or I'll send you their stuff; really, they're wonderful.  They crafted the title instrumental track of Brokeback Mountain into a lovely 8-minute track.  They also remixed the Engine Room song, ""Perfect Lie"" from the title sequence of Nip/Tuck.
My new obsession is Jacques La Cont.  He's a 21 year-old DJ from Germany or England who is being hounded by all the big stars to remix their stuff.  He's remixed Madonna (Get Together and Hollywood), LL Cool J (Control Myself, a SICK remix!), Coldplay (Talk) and Missy Elliot (Lose Control).  While G&D are more trance, La Cont is booty-swaying house that makes ya feel like yer gonna have a seizure!

Everything else is a blur; I've moved back in with my mother until August 1 (though that date is constantly in flux), but it feels like I still don't quite live there.  Boys still mean nothing to me (no interest sexually or otherwise), I'm constantly reading the newspaper (both Tribune, for local info, and New York Times for a better global perspective on newsworthy stories), work at Forza is easy but awfully slow and I don't get to see my friends enough.

But the quarter is over next Thursday, then I have a week off (only work to worry about) and summer quarter starts with a month-long statistics course.  As of July 20, I will have almost TWO MONTHS off from school before the strenuous and climactic senior year begins for me, as I'll be still on the newspaper staff AND taking two courses AND working like I have been this past quarter.

Oh, social life, I hardly knew thee.

"event","So the last couple weeks have been hectic, to put it lightly.  On the plus side, I'm finally on-staff at The Ledger (UWT newspaper) which excites me to no end.  However, that means I have nearly DOUBLE the workload I had before I came on.  In addition I also have my media class that calls for me to do an intensive project that requires me to interview management at Indochine and The Harmon so I can write a paper on old vs. new in blossoming ""revamped"" downtown Tacoma.
     And now I'm behind on two stories that are deadlined for tomorrow for the newspaper due to unforseen circumstances that are most likely my fault.  However, I feel I'm being subjected to an accidental, self-imposed ""trial by fire.""  My lack of experience in researching subjects and such has revealed my rookie flaws (I've never interviewed subjects before nor done extensive research on something that wasn't course-related), though I'm stubbornly confident that I can craft the articles.
     Oh yeah, AND I'm always working.  AND I'm moving out of The House of Sin Friday.  Life is unstable, hellish, and demanding right now.
     But we all know me.  I will persevere and win.  Hopefully next week will lighten the load (as I've altered my work schedule to allow me Mondays and Wednesdays, sometimes Fridays, off so I can take those nights to focus solely on coursework and the newspaper.
     And come June 8, the quarter will be OVER!  One more month and a collective massive sigh of relief can be exhaled.  Please, all of you, pull for me.  This is going to HURT.

"event","So I've been feeling WAY older than I am the last few months.  Is it because I'm coping with so much that's new to me (no car, no job, no insurance, moving out, losing/gaining friends...)?  I don't know, but today has been quite strange; I've felt...just ODD.  Does anybody else get a ""feeling"" that something is wrong or that if you look over your shoulder, something out-of-this-world is going to act out-of-sorts and surprise you?  I've had that all day, but...

1) Today was my first ACTUAL shift at Forza.  I can attest to the fact that this experience is going to be WAY 180 from Starbucks.  I recognized the fact, while walking home, that the ""family"" of partners at each Starbucks store bond over their misery for the job.  I can tell you that after nearly 6 years with that hideous company that EVERYbody at the store level (barista through managers, even) DETESTS their position there.  But at Forza (so far anyway), we all bond over the JOB.  It's fun because we're all different and are the underdogs, essentially, right now.  Five hours of work today produced perhaps 10 customers.  We JUST opened yesterday so of course the word isn't quite all-around yet.  But we did wow the customers we did have.  Haha, Starbucks, every day I bad-mouth you to customers who inquire about coffee establishments.  And this will not cease.  I am a LOYALIST (read: consumer who cares about purchases and diversion of personal funds to what they believe in).

2) Len helped me sell Betty for $300!  HooRAY!  Some extra cash to help me find a new place by the middle of June.

3) The newspaper gig is coming along; my first articles are set to be published in the school paper on Thursday.  GRANTED my main article is tinkered with as to not offend the subjects (my editor is a lil worried that, ironically, I was TOO objective in writing the article).  Whatev, as long as I get it published, and the nervousness is justified then subsides, and I can move onto the next assignment with confidence.

4) I'm totally getting old.  My new favorites songs are ""Say Somethin"" by Mariah Carey (and I despise her as much as Beyonce, if not more) and ""By Your Side"" by Sheryl Crow and Sting.  Talk about GEEZER tunes!

I don't even know what else to say, I feel so strange right now.  But I am content at my new job and am thrilled that the extra time I have now can be directed to improving my writing and working on myself.

"event","...So if you read my last post, you'll remember that I was waiting for the square peg to fit through the circular hole.  Yes, there was too much waiting to pass through.

But now there is diarrhea of events occurring that I can't wait to STOP!

1) I officially begin working at FORZA tomorrow morning at 9am, training as a Barista AGAIN!  This is gonna be great, though, cuz this isn't the Starbucks cop-out fantasy that I endured for five'ish treacherous, respect-destroying, indignant years.  Yes, I actually get to CRAFT each drink, NOT push buttons and moo at the moo-sayers.  No no, I have to learn how to actually CREATE each drink.  I'm actually excited.  And this is good for me because this is a job with hardly ANY responsibility (remember that Kevin Spacey line from American Beauty?  That's pretty-much me right now) which allows me to walk away EVERY shift with tips (they're divided between people who worked particular shifts NOT EACH WEEK LIKE STARBUCKS DOES.  THAT, my friends, we all can agree is UNFAIR and SHIT) and allows me to...

2) Write for The Ledger, UW-T's student newspaper.  I'm on a two-article trial run right now to see if I can hack it on the paper.  I wrote a review (I'd rather critique but it's easier to review for the masses) on Thank You For Smoking and covered a town meeting by Phyllis Wise, provost for the UW.  That article has been HELL to produce, seeing as I've yet to write a REAL news article for ANY publication.  I can't wait till it's finally published and I can be proud.  And begin the process again.

3) I'm eyeing this next weekend as the one to move out.  I don't know HOW I'm going to do it, seeing as I have NO car AND I CLOSE both nights!  I've decided I'm going to move back in with my mom for a month until Xan and I can hatch a plan to move somewhere.  We'll both have some more money (ideally) then and I cannot live at home any longer!  Bleh, I've been on my own long enough now.  It just happens that now I'm completely broke, but things should change on that front in the next month.  Ideally.

     Otherwise, all else is peach'ish.  I went to a party in CENTRALIA on Saturday night and only remember the first hour of being there (THAT'S when ya know it's good, right?).  Woke up drunk today.  I HATE that, but overall, a success.  School is fun, but challenging.  Proceed.  I STILL don't have my Cobra benefits even though they've been sitting on my payment for OVER A WEEK NOW.  ""We'll rush the process,"" the woman said.  THAT was Thursday.  And I have YET to have my meds in this time in my life where I NEED to focus and it's been trying because I've been off my ADD meds for two weeks.
     Thanks, Starbucks.  I WAS important.

Haha, but now it's time for bed.  Tomorrow begins a NEW tumultuous week.  OH YEAH!  Dining Out For Life is Thursday and against my wishes, I am going to Seattle (not that I don't want to, I'd just prefer to support Pierce County since it's smaller than King and I know people down here with HIV).  That's super.  Come one, come all!  Dining Out is SUCH a great occasion and only happens ONCE a year!

"event","Has anybody else encountered a time/situation/phase/moment in time (indefinite; one minute to one year and so forth) in their life where they're just WAITING on a whole bunch of shit to happen?  Not bored-like, but rather they can't MOVE ON with their lives until many other events fall into place and/or start in-motion?  For instance, my life right now WON'T proceed until (hopefully) the end of the week BECAUSE:

1) Had an interview on Friday in-which I was told I may start Wednesday.  I provided them my schedule and now I'm WAITING on them to get back to me (hopefully tomorrow, seeing as it WILL be the beginning of the week and all).  UNTIL then I'm hangin on whether I indeed got the job...

2) I have a (panel) interview tomorrow at school for a newswriting position.  I won't know the hours I can contribute to them UNTIL I know about the OTHER job I'm waitin for word on...

3) I am assembling plans to move out by the end of the month BUT I'm WAITING on word from a dear friend on whether he can be my roomate AND word on how much I'll be able to pay for rent PENDING the outcomes of these job interviews...

4) I can't get my ADD medication UNTIL my Cobra medical papers go thru which could take to the end of the week!  I've had to get thru the last few classes on XANEX, not my usual ADD meds!  Talk about fucking with myself!

That's all I've gathered thus far.  Point is, SHIT NEEDS TO HAPPEN!  BUT...I don't wanna jhinx it all and fuck everything up.  I am being PATIENT, tentative, hopeful, yet anxious.  Anxiety is NOT a good thing for crazy people; hence, my medication.

BUT I did have a smashing good time with Kyle last nite.  Saw some faces I hadn't seen in quite a while (Brett, Robby, Jesse, stragglers from Taco-ma) which was refreshing for once (NOTE: When you see faces you haven't seen in a while here in Tacoma, it's RARELY a good thing.  In Seattle, however, the outcome is usually favorable.  Don't ask why.  Just.  Don't.).  Then Kyle and I got up this morning at 11:30 (amazing since I don't think we went to bed till 4) and had scrumptious conversation on the lenai of Cafe Vidro by Apartment 901.

Shut up, Dee and Kyle, I fucked up at LEAST THREE ""FACTS"" about that last sentence.

"event","So today has been the devil spawn of all days.  I woke up natious and have been struggling not to throw up all day.  I thought perhaps I was coming down with a flu, but then I realized I'm prob'ly just hungover and my body is punishing me for being mean to it all weekend.  I've hardly eaten a full, DECENT (read: nutritious) meal in many days, haven't been takin my medication, and have been drinking TOO heavily.  SO, tonight I am laying low, popping a Xanex soon, watchin a movie till I get tired and sleeping at least 9 hours to compensate for this weekend.

I still suck on the job front.  I had an interview at Cost Plus on Wednesday and the woman said she'd call me by today to confirm a position.  No call.  Fuck, all I want is A JOB; not a career, not a shitload of responsibility or endless tests of deeming myself worthy of a POSITION.  Why is it this difficult to catch on somewhere?  I have MORE than the average joe in terms of credentials.  With each passing day I grow more paranoid that Starbucks has me blacklisted and I'm not going to get on anywhere.  If all else fails, though, summer is just two months away and wouldn't it make sense that I HAVE to find something then?  I just don't get it right now.

The living situation is stable for another maybe 3 weeks.  Then I have to move out of this house; but do I go back with my Mom or find a fledgling situation somewhere else?  It would make sense to move back with mom except for the fact that we have NEVER gotten along when we live together.  Our relationship is SO much better when we have our distance; even my COUNSELOR is vetoing a possible move home.  AH!

Otherwise, life is dandy *laughs*.  I did have fun Saturday night in Seattle and I just got a call from a former co-worker to hang out Wednesday night.  I just have to remind myself CONstantly that I am trying all I can to better my life (well, in my mind I am); I've reformatted my resume, applied several places, been denied Unemployment because I can't work full-time because of my school hours, registered with several job sites to scour possibilities and put myself out there.  Why is it this difficult?!

"event","Wow, so this weekend totally wiped me out.  I began the weekend Friday night with a viewing of Before Sunrise, an adorable movie with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (the original, not the recent sequel).  Saturday I went up to Seattle and had dinner with Dee's 15-deep family at Spaghetti Factory; my ADD kicked in and eventually I fled to Pioneer Square and actually DANCED to mediocre Drum'n'bass at Temple Billiards.  This was deemed wonderful, however, because it was with a buncha my ol' raver buddies, some of whom I hadn't seen since Pride last year.  Yay for mai tai's and sweat-staining my new Armani Exchange shirt from Boston!!!

Sunday was prepping Dee's apartment w/Kyle for a wee shindig 10-deep.  We had finger-foods and plenty o'wine!  Great conversation was had, then shuttled to the W Hotel for cocktails and more juicy convo!  After a late-night cappuccino splurge at Baehaus, it was back to the apartment and awful sleep only to awaken and head back down to Tacoma and prep for today's class!

So, needless to say, I haven't taken my meds in a few days so I'm feeling a bit anxious and all, especially after 3 beers and 3 hours notating 3 chapters of my media book I neglected to finish before partying the weekend away.  NOTE TO SELF (AND YOU): DISTRIBUTE homework evenly to avoid bunched studying that fries your brain.  I am in shambles right now, I'm so mentally drained from everything.

However, I'm going to apply at Cost-Plus World Market tomorrow.  I very-much want to work there or at Border's because I've decided I want to work for a company and push product that I can STAND BEHIND.  Starbucks is sincerely awful and peddles an atrociously unecessary product.  Blah.  Talk about selling out...

Lots of homework this week but hopefully by the weekend I'll be rested and ready to play!
Oh yeah, hooray also for no sex drive!  The more perverts I see and hear from, the happier I am that I'm nearly impotent from all the meds I'm on.  Ha ha HA!

"event","...Or something like that.

So I spoke with a ""Regional representative"" for Starbucks.  How could I have expected him to be sympathetic to my case?  His tone was condescending during our 20 minute conversation yesterday afternoon and I don't expect him to accomplish much.  He asked me what I expected the outcome of my complaint to be, my job back?  I replied ""Oh no, I don't want that job back.""  He proceded to go into a spiel about how a majority of employees of Starbucks enjoy their work and the company.  I literally laughed.  He asked why so I replied, ""You haven't talked to the people I have.  I know many more people dissatisfied with this company than those who are happy.  This is not a good company; I have known SO many co-workers who left the company for BETTER jobs because they didn't like this one.""  He of course retorted with something like ""Well there ARE those who are content being in one place.""  Again, I laughed.

Then I sent him a FIVE-PAGE 19-point list of why my termination was unjust.  I won't get into them all here; regardless, they've picked the WRONG person to be their fall guy.  All I'm requesting is the opportunity to sit down with my then-manager and district manager and EXPLAIN POINT-BY-POINT the wrongness of their actions.  Then I want their apologies.  THEN I want to explain how it is to act morally, ethically, and humanely.  THEN perhaps I'll be satisfied.

And if I'm not, my mother has offered her lawyer's services because she is also in the throes of a lawsuit against the Chehalis school district for wrongful termination.  Not to mention I already have many friends backing me up on my boycott of Starbucks.  AND the fact that my mother is also dumping her shares of Starbucks stock if this situation is not resolved to my satisfaction.

The wrong fall guy, I repeat.

But school is great!  Economics of Sports is going to be a fun class cuz it combines a career-interest of mine (sports journalism) with a beneficial-to-understand subject in economics.  Writing For Mass Media will also be beneficial because not only is the professor strict and structured in her expectations and requirements of us, but we're going to study a broad array of topics that I can sample from to see if I want to pursue further (Public Relations, advertising, print and broadcast journalism, and so forth).

And if my unemployment papers go through, I'm going to be making like $50 LESS than I would be making if I were at Starbucks.  Pretty pitiful after nearly 6 years of work, isn't it?

"event","Nowhere to begin but right here:

- I was fired last Friday from STARBUCKS.  I've been off-and-on with that company since August of 2000; continuously since April of 2003.  I wasn't angry that I got fired; sure I didn't agree with the decision, so I didn't sign the termination papers.  However, the HANDLING of the situation is what has me filing a grievance with the regional representative of STARBUCKS.  Let's run down the list of the ERRORS of the actual firing:

 + The district manager LIED to my face.  He said my ""co-workers' account of the story differs from yours too much.""  That's funny because he only interviewed ONE of my co-workers when I mentioned the OTHER one in my account of things at LEAST three times.  She already said she'd gladly go-to-bat for me on this one, though.
 +On top of that, the woman he DID interview just happens to be a close friend of mine.  Why her?  Because he knew it'd cause a rift between us cuz she and I have had rifts before concerning customers.
 + A brand-new manager took over the store the week I was fired.  Make sense that I'd get fired so easily after five'ish years?  Not quite.  The new manager is a woman I've known for FOUR years and I used to work with and go to her place to drink and hang out.  Aaahhh, the plot thickens:
 + The new manager says nothing the entire time they grilled me.  See, the way it works at STARBUCKS is you suck your district manager's dick when you get the job.  ""So you've come this far,"" they say.  ""Now show me how far you can make me cum.""  Instead of going-to-bat for me, she sits back and only says ""Well two complaints in three months is too many, so we have to terminate you.""  Then when she DOES get the opportunity to talk to me in-private, she doesn't say anything but ""do you have your keys?""  Hmmm, can we say CORPORATE WHORE?
 +Which really is too bad, cuz she used to be a good person.  Now she's one of those tools content with living a moronic and morose life with a fat, hopeless boyfriend in Federal Way (sorry, Kyle).
 + I was fired in front of my peers.  Funny, I've never seen that before.  If you don't think that's trying to set a precedent or make an example of me, the plot thickens further, my friends...
 +Upon leaving, my former manager WARNED the district manager that I was friends with the new manager as well as the assistant and another barista (we ALL worked together four years ago at the same store as mere baristas).  When a simple complaint (which was only ONE person's view; funny, our court system doesn't even act this subjective or tyrannical) comes up against me, suddenly I'm fired after almost six years of loyal service.  What choice did the new manager have?  Either she fired me to send a message to my peers that we are NOT to be as close as we are, or she gets off on the wrong foot with the district manager and suddenly the rest of her career under him is monitored and scrutinized.

So it all makes sense from many points-of-view.  It's good, in the end, however, because I honestly do despise STARBUCKS.  They are a ridiculous company that hides under the veil of ""we treat our employees well.  Just look at our health plans!""  Hmmm, while that is true, look at the fact that we CANNOT unionize.  That word is so taboo in the company that any utterance of it warrants your termination in less than two weeks (it happened in Manhattan last year; look it up).  The word is so taboo that even Howard Schultz himself wrote an internal letter to the employees of the company bitching and whining about how well he treats us and that he's so offended that we'd even consider a union.
And on top of that, after nearly six years of service, my maximum pay-per-hour was under $10.  How exactly do people live on raises of $.10-.19 EVERY SIX MONTHS?  The message is clear in the company: if you don't want to move up and eat what we feed you, you're expendable by someone ignorant enough to replace you and taste what we're offering.

CORPORATE BULLSHEEEIT.

So, yes, yet ANOTHER new dawn.  School starts Monday and that's awesome; I'm taking Economics of Sports (to understand the technical aspects of sports since I want to get into sports journalism) and Writing for the Mass Media.  This should be great!
Spent five days in Boston.  That was much fun; a smaller Manhattan is what it feels like, with speckles of San Fran and Queens throughout.  I got to see my bestest friend, Greg, and go to a club with him.  I hadn't seen him in four years, and he commuted all the way from Manhattan to kick it!  He's the ONLY one who's known me longer than Dee.  KuhRAYzee, my friends!

Anyway, lesson of the day: STARBUCKS = bad.  Don't go there; there are SO many alternatives.  Just look, don't be a lazy schlep.  Especially here in Seattle.

Unless, of course, you WANT to be another nameless cow ushered through corporate propaganda.

I finally went out in Seattle for the first time in a month and had a lame time.  Saw an AWFUL movie for my film class then went out Monday night with a friend I've seen maybe twice in the past three years and proceded to get completely obliterated on $100 worth of red wine.  Yikes.

But my friend and I had WONderful conversation, even before the red wine buzz kicked in.  She's moving to New York next month to begin an exciting new career.  I'm so happy for her!  I'm going to Boston in less than a month and shopping at H&M is first on my list of things-to-do!  I have yet to begin my 8-page ethics paper due in two weeks.  Yikes.

Things between Scott and I are, I'll go ahead and label it, at a crossroads.  Although we do enjoy each other's company and get along fine, we haven't spoken in a few days.  But, that doesn't mean drama can't happen!  Oh no, the girls at my work are keeping the gossip mill running all hands on-deck!  The fact is NONE of my friends like him, and the girl who set us up confided in me the other day that she's concerned about me getting hurt.  She admitted I mean more to her and she apologized for blah-blah'ing to our co-workers about what had been said between she and Scott.  I appreciated her concern but admitted I'm a big boy now and can handle this without the confusion of questioning the validity of talk circulating around me.

"event","So I just spent 3 hours writing my Matador review and revising my Bubble review.  My Film Critique professor (going on my second quarter with me, and she's been teaching for almost 30 years so I trust her comments) likes my writing but insists I get bogged down with over-saturating my sentences with ""abstract"" language.  Those of you who know me well that this is often the case, even more these days when I speak.  I dunno what it is, I just love vivid language.

Scott came into my work last night and gave me a cute lil heart o'chocolates.  It was real sweet of him to visit me since he doesn't have a car, and I confessed that I appreciate him visiting me cuz it gets me giddy!  He said he likes to see me happy and was glad he could do it on this V-Day.  He was in a suit and tie from his Student Senate meeting and looked FANtastic.  He said he'll try hard to make it to Project Runway tonight, but he's said that before and didn't show.  Then again, things have progressed drastically since those few weeks ago and he knows I revel in his company and always want him to make the party.

Alright, now that the film homework is done, now it's onto Ethics and the homework.  I have to pick a topic for my 8-page paper and I'm leaning towards the media's treatment and representation of homosexuals both in print (Catholic church and sex offenders) and entertainment (TV and movies).  I think I have to pick ONE of those though.  My professor is great, hopefully she'll let me do both.

PROJECT RUNWAY TONIGHT AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT!  COME ONE, COME ALL!  FREE BEER, PIZZA, BITCH BOOZE, FLIPZ, AND CHIPS!

Thursday I went to work and stood, BORED, 10 minutes before my shift.  I told the assistant manager, ""Um, I'm bored.  This is the FIRST time since JANUARY 3 that I've been BORED.  I have NO homework.""  ""Shouldn't you be happy?"" he asked.  ""No,"" I replied.  ""I'm SCARED.  This shouldn't happen.""
And then WHAM, my Ethics professor assigns us an 8-page paper (on our choice of an array of ethical ""topics"") due in 3 weeks that must include at least EIGHT sources in the bibliography.  Hmmm, can you say STUDY PAPER?  The next three Wednesdays, and then some, will be spent ENTIRELY constructing this devil-of-a-paper.

Scott and I spent the afternoon together yesterday.  So it's pretty-much established: we like each other (duh!).  He stopped in at 9:30pm Thursday night to say hi and invite me to watch a movie with him and his friends when I was off work.  I thanks him for the thought but I was smelly and wanted to go home after work.  He said he liked that and made me give him a hug.  He's muchos fun to spend time with; and, y'know, the make-out sessions are great as well.  Would it be forward to get him SOMEthing for V-day?  I mean, I don't wanna come on way too strong here, but we do have fun together and I tease him like a kid and he calls me ""brat.""  Cute.

So it's off to see Matador tonight for my film class and book tickets to BOSTON w/Dee and Katie!  I'm SO excited for this vacation (March 18-23 if yer wonderin); my BESTEST friend who's living in New York said he'd find a way over to visit me too!

"event","...Wouldn't that be nice?  So another week flushed away; my ethics professor says my (home)work is ""constantly thoughtful and thorough"" but she'd like me to participate in class dicussion more.  Problem with that is, there are too many other opinionated dipshits in my class who don't think before throwing their two cents in (as opposed to ""offering"" it, like they should be doing).  HellO!  Ethical decision require moral judgment and a thorough process that includes many steps.  Thus, I rarely contribute in class because I avoid confrontation and if I were to respond to anybody's ""opinions,"" chances are I'd bite their faces.

Things between Scott and I are slowly progressing.  In a good way this time.  We spent Saturday afternoon together on the couch, since we were both tired and had no place to go.  It was real sweet, I was nuzzling his neck and happened to look up at him and he said ""You are beautiful.  Have I mentioned that yet?""  And ick, before you pop a Mentos and picture a tacky Freddie Prinze Jr. teen movie moment, take into account that I don't take compliments well and am rarely impressed by guys' gimmicks.  It was a sincere moment and I was flattered.  He's a boy that actually calls when he says he's going to, he's already very honest about everything and is up-front.  It really is refreshing to see someone who's educated, realistic, honest, and pursuing goals and is proactive.

The Seahawks lost, but the upside is that I was born in Pittsburgh and the Superbowl couldn't have gone to a more deserving team (Jerome Bettis is likely retiring and Bill Cowher is one of the primo coaches in the league), so I'm not too disturbed.  Oh, and I was pissed about missing the second half cuz I had a useless 4 hr closing shift at work, so I downed 7 beers before going.  Hmmm, and I functioned just fine.  Go figger.

"event","So one of the most difficult weeks of this quarter is FINALLY complete and I step back feeling...confident, of all things.  My first ethics paper (which is worth 15% of my overall grade and had to be 4 pages long), which took me HOURS to labor over and complete (thank GOD Abby, this woman I work with, coached me through it, being the philosophy queen that she is), earned me an A-!  I'm SO relieved, seeing as ethics is this subject I am SO a novice in and am grasping to care about, let alone understand.

I'm sorry, but I honestly don't care HOW we came to be on this earth.  In my mind, we're here (some of us queer), so that's that.  No lookin back now.  I've always been bored with history, too, so perhaps that has a minor role in my severe ADD when it comes to doing my ethics homework.  But actually, I am becoming more intrigued with the concepts, theories, and ideologies that are tossed around my peers each class session.  There's some hotties, too; too bad they're too outspoken.

So, overall, school is treating me well thus far.  BUT...this is still the first month.  I DID end up dropping my Critical Issues in Global Health class, cuz not only was it 4.5 hours long EVERY Friday morning, but it was writing intensive, and combined with my other classes, it just was the weakest link, not to mention a harmless elective.

So EVERY week looks like this so far:

MONDAY - Sleep in, get going around noon'ish and write critique of film I viewed Sunday evening.  Finish up whatever is left of my ethics homework.  (Every other Monday, spend an hour in counseling to try and squeegee the mess in my head).  Go to film class at 6:45, get out around 9:15, come home and have dinner and do more homework.

TUESDAY - Get up at 9:30am, get on bus to ethics class from 10:30-12:45, take bus to work and work all afternoon (and usually into the night to close), get home around 10:30pm and try and relax or finish up film critique homework.

WEDNESDAY - Get up around 7am and bus to work mid-day (usually 8-4), work on ethics homework, take bus to film class from 6:30-9:15, go home and prep house for Project Runway Night, finish ethics homework until 1-2am.

THURSDAY - Get up 9:30am, take bus to ethics class from 10:30-12:45, take bus to work, work on ethics homework, work 3-10:15, get home around 10:30 and have a drink to congratulate myself on week completed.  SLEEP (finally).

FRIDAY - Get up around 11, bus to work and do ethics/film homework (alternating between both to not get burnt out and maintain concentration), work 3-10:15, get home around 10:30 and try and find people to go out with (either Silverstone or just dinner someplace).

SATURDAY - ONLY DAY I DON'T HAVE WORK OR SCHOOL!  BUT...am I gonna do homework?  NO!  I need A DAY OFF, so I find something to do with whomever can spare some time for lil ol me.  Seattle usually, yay to get away!

SUNDAY - Half the time I'm up at 5am to work 5:30-2pm, then it's to Ma's house to visit with her and my bro, take a brief nap, have dinner, go home and do homework.  Then it's off to the movies to view whatever film my class decides to watch and write about for the following week's discussion and critique.

Rinse.  Cycle.  Repeat.  So, thus, I am the busiest I've ever been in my life.  And it hurts but I feel confident.  Oh yeah, and did I mention I'm doing this all WITHOUT A CAR and with ADD?  *Hisses* Hoo-RAH!

IN OTHER NEWS: Scott and I are on uneven ground.  We've only been on one date but we've hung out otherwise a couple times, and I really like being around him.  Unfortunately, he's a little odd and a bit of a homebody cuz he's trying to adapt to new housemates and between us, we maybe have a FEW hours to spare for each other each week.  I am going to UPS tomorrow night after work and seeing Rent with him; his idea since he couldn't make it to Project Runway last night.  So things are crawling along, which is just fine with me.

But I'm horny.  And I need a release.

Advice?
(NOTE: Don't suggest my ""hand"" cuz it's void in 48 states)

"event","Finally, another stress-filled week comes to an end.  It is my Friday this Thursday night and I'm celebrating with a glass of pinot noir.  This week has seen me grieve over an eternal end to something that could have been beautiful but dissolved from the inside out.  It's seen me work all week.  It's seen me write a 4-page ethics paper and discuss Capote and Shirley Temple in my film class.

I am also proud to announce that I hosted my first Project Runway party.  Some girls from work came, as did Scott and Dee, and some random strays (Jake's date, roomates, etc).  As expected it was an EXCELLENT episode and I expect to host more parties.  If you're interested, don't question yourself or me...just come on Wednesday at 9:45pm!!!  I am so infatuated with this show it's sickening.  It's ALL Katie and I talk about at work; we're getting our peers/co-workers to get interested and even harrassing customers (""hello, Jim.  You're either in or you are out...""  I LOVE it!  I was letting Katie go home early today and I said, ""Katie Sullivan, your time here has been eventful.  However, your focus has been shaky and your desire to stay on-task has not been there.  Therefore, you are out.""  I am SUCH a Runway Junkie.

As mentioned above, Scott came.  So here's his story: He's 21, a business major at UPS, who is also heavily into extra-curricular activities (like Student Senate, Gay projects/get-togethers, and so forth), and has been friends with a co-worker of mine for over a year (and I adore her as well).  Scott and I went on a date last week (see two posts ago if you even care) which went well, I thought.  He came to Runway last night and called me today to say he had a good time (it was a cute rambling message).  I invited him to Katie's birthday party Saturday night (complete with an Alice In Wonderland theme) and he said he's like to go.  Yay for that *crosses fingers*!

It's refreshing to meet a guy who is not stagnant in his life; he's actively pursuing his attainable goals and keeps himself busy by engaging in effective activities that have a positive social purpose.  Sure, I may be going through a schoolboy phase (dammit I just want to meet a guy who's educated and has SOME sort of grasp on not only some aspirations, but himself as well), but he fits it well.  Until one of us fucks things up (isn't that inevitable?).

Tomorrow I sleep in for the first time in a great many days.  Then I'll do some readings for my ethics class next week (it's a challenging class but I'm slowly catching on and engaging myself into the process of determining moral actions and identifying ideals and obligations and consequences to a given case study) and it's eventually off to the Sheraton with Dee to be his date for some gala or get-together for the Westin.  Yay for that and staying in a free hotel room!  He'd better not try to drug me and grope me in our room *grin.*

I'm still horribly crazy as well (and I'm not being dramatic or ""bourgeous"") but I see my counselor Monday afternoon, where hopefully I can cry for help and see what next course of action we can pursue.  Seeing as I've been stuck in this rut since the beginning of August, it's getting quite tiring I confess.

Enjoy your weekends, kittens, and I hope to speak with everybody (you define that one) very soon!

"event","So a ten-minute break in my ethics class has brought me to a public computer to make an entry here.  Why?  It's never happened before.

I guess I'm just thinking a lot lately.
And would'ja blame me?

So I'm slowly jumping onto this ethics bandwagon.  It's been a very challenging class for me thus far because I've never taken a philosophy or ethics course before, and hey, this stuff is real deep (I'd love to hear what you think about it, Chris Rodkey).
After this I'm off to work 8 hours then write a 3-4 page paper on an ethical issue of whether it's ""prudent"" to publish a photo depicting the mass slaughter by a postal factory worker.  Hmmm, I'm consulting Abby, a woman I work with, to construct this paper to ensure I cover all the bases (she's a philosophy buff).

I went on a date with Scott last night.  Dinner at the Spaghetti Factory, wine at Cafe Divino, then the 25th Hour at my house.  Dammit I was up till 3am and had to be up at 9:30 for this going-to-be very long day.  He's a cute guy (Jake even thought so, but is that really a surprise?) with lots to say and a lot on his plate (he's a business major at UPS who's also on the student senate, he overlooks a house of students, and participates in a plethora of extracurricular activities).  I dunno what could possibly come from this, but I'd like to hang out with him more (time permitting between the two of us).  We'll see; I invited him to Project Runway party on Wednesday night.  Will he be scared if he goes?  Probably.  But it'll be some time with him and my wonderful friends.

Back to the philosophers.  Caio

"event","Does anybody know why whenever Limewire updates, everything I'd downloaded disappears?  I am currently missing 11 hours of Gabriel and Dresden mixes as well as hours of Fiona Apple.  I'm surprisingly not so-much angry as genuinely confused as to why this continued to happen.

School is already starting to kick my butt.  I am taking Ethics in Mass Communication (philosophy basically), Film Critique (sounds like a breeze but it's actually quite in-depth into analyzing film and critiquing specific aspects), and Critical Issues In Global Health (a 4.5 hour class every Friday where we examine a different threat to global health every week, complete with guest speakers and explicit videos).  I have TONS of reading to do which is proving difficult because not only do I have ADD and have to really struggle to concentrate on what I'm reading (particularly the ethics which doesn't make a lot of sense to me yet since this is the first time I've been exposed to such deep theories and concepts), but I have one class every day and on top of that am working 25-30 hours per week.  I have Saturdays clear which is good, and no work Monday, but I have class that night.  SO, homework will be done EVERY day, with emphasis on Mondays.  I have two presentations to prepare and MANY a research paper to write.  Patience and discipline, start your engines...

Otherwise I'm quite content.  Still crazy, I'm afraid, but coping with that on an every-moment basis.  My social life is going quite well.  I love the fact that I have an integrated circle of friends; my co-workers know my other friends and at any given time we could all get together and rock out.  I only have ONE aspect of my life that I don't have much control over, but this weekend that issue will get addressed and my heart will self-destruct no matter the outcome.

Regeneration, start your engine...

"event","PURPOSEFUL MISTAKE

I've fallen from grace, apparently, I've felt
There's no recovering from the deficit of attention from you-
No words can recooperate the positivity I've lost,
The humanity I attempt to win, but lose.
No matter the efforts I attempt to exude
Or vein attempts to catch your eye in mid-stride -
The fact is I'll never be the apple of your eye
And I've lost sight of the high that I used to ride.
Ignorance is one thing I'm adept to ignore
Yet feigned interest is something I cannot forgive -
You're less-than-whole-hearted ""attempts"" to charm me
Have forged an ill-hope that hurts to live.
So often I've told myself that you're real,
That you're the infinite man I'm destined to adore -
When, in all actuality, you're an incessant reminder
Of a past I'm endeared to suffer through more.

A part of me continues, that believes I should dare,
Yet another reminds me you so obviously don't care.
You look through me, I'm absent, when you stare,
And you're innocent to me when I insipidly glare.
All of me hurts when this adoration I pain to share
Is for not because your heart and your mind just don't care.

I cannot continue to contribute to an empty cause
When, each morning, I dress out of your bed -
And later-on lose faith in your pseudo-attention
When I think of the careless things you have said.
There's nothing to recant, no words to retract,
Not a statement to explain or a feeling to disable -
Instead, I'll awaken beside your sleeping body, a mess
And take my money from off the bedside table.
For so long I've tried to recapture your heart
When all along you've proven yourself anything but amorous -
For every reason you've given me to try and love you, for once
I've forgiven myself for hardly feeling glamorous.
You'll never realize that I'm pretty on the inside,
Instead you'll egotistically, externally act brazen -
But all-along I've excruciatingly pined away for you
In weak attempts to light fire to old feelings that were blazing.

Every day feels like a purposeful mistake
Where I'm destined to believe in a Catch 22 fate.
For so long I've belonged to an unappeasing state
Where I'm forbidden from quitting you, which I hate.
I hate myself for craving you this late
When all I really want is to clean this slate.

God damn I want to forget about you,
To drown myself in my own life for once -
Yet I cannot avoid every thought bearing your name
And every itch of my skin that demands your touch.
Every time you neglect to adress me as me,
I despise you a little more each time -
But in all actuality, I regard you nonetheless
And you remain a constant, blissful thought in my mind.
There's too much about you I try to ignore
When it's me you're reluctant to regard -
When it's me you hardly hesitate to ignore
Or have to downplay or think about too hard.
I'm barely an emotion or afterthought to you now,
But I'll remain a crutch presence in your mind -
Because each boy that you think could potentially be good
Will surely cause you to remember me each-and-every time."

"event","Two days into this year and already I feel wretched.  Today, for some odd reason, just sucked at work.
I didn't even get up till 12:30 and made it to Ma's to get presents she brought back from her Christmas in Mazatlan.  I got a nice leather wallet, two pairs of earrings (she'd neglected to notice I haven't had my ears pierced in nearly 3 years) which I believe I just may tear through the scar issue in my lobes to wear, then a liter of Absolut Vodka.  So, okay, THAT part of the day was great.
However, my mood all day has just been ""blah.""  I theorize it's the result of mixing a disgusting 2004 Syrah with my head meds last night.  So work was awful, it was slow and the only people who came in were the WORST customers none of the staff likes.  I looked at Mags and was like ""is it a full moon?""  I ever told my manager I believed I was awful in a past life to be punished like today.

But now I'm listening to Fiona Apple's ""Extraordinary Machine"" with BRILLIANT songs like ""Parting Gift,"" ""Red Red Red,"" ""Get Him Back,"" etc.  And drinking that aforementioned Syrah.  I'm anticipating tomorrow's first day of school.  This quarter is going to be a TRUE test in personal strength.  Firstly, I'm still seeing a counselor and ""drug doctor"" to experiment with what meds aid me and which don't.  Secondly, I have one class all five days of the week, the one on Friday being a 4.5 hour class.  Thirdly, I'm working 5-6 days per week on top of all of that.  Fourthly...see the previous three.  I do believe I can pull this off (I averaged a 3.65 last quarter), but it will take a LOT of willingness, perseverence, PATIENCE (the main trait I lack), and willpower.  Luckily there's a Starbucks next to school so I can take my ""focus meds"" and follow them with a hot caffeine injection.  Wish me luck?  Thanks for the thought (that I just put in your head), but I don't believe in luck.  But I DO believe in karma; go figure.

So here we go with the new year.  I also don't believe in resolutions so instead I will treat this year like making a wish on 12:34 any time you notice.

*Takes deep breath* I hope we all do well these first few months and the next foreseeable goal is getting to Boston for Spring Break at the end of March.

"event","So much swirling around in my head, yet not much to disclose to the rest of you (well, anything that seems halfway relevant, anyway).  So let's do bullets, cuz it helps me divulge more:

- School is out until the 3rd of 2006; I got an A- in my writing class and a B+/A- in my film class.  Not bad for my first quarter back at school, a university nonetheless, in almost three years.

- I've been listening, non-stop, to Gabriel & Dresden.  If you haven't heard of them, I don't blame you.  However, if you get the opportunity, download their stuff or ask me for my fav cuts.  Basically they were producers for big names in the biz and have since gone out on their own and become dj's.  Try finding the ""World On Fire"" remix (Sarah McLachlan) on their album, ""Bloom.""  Also, Dido's ""Don't Leave Home"" and Annie Lennox's ""Pavement Cracks"" are great tracks.  Seriously, check em out!

- I've been stuck on this one guy for a while, y'all don't have to guess (figure it out if you even have to).  But he doesn't seem interested and although it tears me up inside, it does provide for good writing and raw emotion.  Also, a girl at work is trying to hook me up with her friend and we talked on the phone last night; he's really cute (I've seen him twice) and is a business major at UPS.  I've been seeking a guy in school for a while now cuz it at least PROVES he's somewhat half-assed into getting an education and that's HOT.  But this guy's going to Thailand for a couple weeks so our ""going out"" will be postponed.  Whatev

- Christmas is going to be my first alone; my Mom is going to Mazatlan on X-Mas Eve while my bro and I go to the Colts/Seahawks game.  I'm housesitting for her until New Year's and that's cool cuz I'll get quality time with my kitty and I'm having an ex co-worker stay with me for a week and we get along well.

- I am IN-LOVE with PROJECT RUNWAY.  Before you rush to judge, realize that the ONLY reality TV shows I've EVER watched religiously have been: Temptation Island (ONLY because my roomates were stuck on it and I had no choice when I got home from work but to watch it with them), Real World (ONLY London, Miami, and Seattle; all others didn't interest me), and now Project Runway.  I've TRIED to watch The Great Race, Survivor, the Apprentice, and all the popular reality shows but they bore me.  My co-worker, Katie (I LOVE her), forced me to watch the show while we baked holiday cookies.  And now, on only the second episode I've ever watched, I CRIED when the contestant got kicked off the show.  I HATE SANTINO!!!  Unfortunately he's good for ratings cuz he's the resurrection of Wendy Pepper or, GASP, Omarosa.

- I've been reprimanded at work for my behavior.  I'm sorry, but I've been waiting on picky-assed boring-assed customers for FIVE years now, and if you treat me rudely I will in-turn treat you rudely.  I'm sorry, but you deserve it if you're going to talk down to ANYbody.  I STRICTLY believe that EVERYbody is human and therefore we're all human on all levels and are EQUAL.  Fuck you if you think money makes you above me; take it somewhere else if you're going to be a cunt.

AND...I'm spent.  Me thinks.  Quickly: YAY for Chris Rodkey coming to Olympia soon (I can't wait to kick it at clubs and with Kyle and whatnot), YAY for the holidays bringing us closer to our families (well, except me; hey, I'll consider it taking one for the team on behalf of all of you), YAY to working and living in transition.  Life is about evolving and it's about damned time we all took a step forward in our lives.

"event","So the weekend WAS shaping up to be fun.  Usually I have the weekend planned out by Thursday night.  This weekend was no exception, knowing full-well that the upcoming next two weeks are going to rough, even with no school.  But anyhoot, Friday night I went to bed early, aware that the rest of the weekend was going to be strenuous.  Saturday I worked all day and then headed to Seattle where I had dinner at the Hooter's on Lake Union with 23 gay men and two women.  It was a fun dinner, expensive, but lots of cool people (although I didn't speak with many of them; we all seemed to be having a good time, though, and that's the most important part).  Then it was off to Rosebud for pre-game drinks with Kyle and Dee and Brett.  Then, of course, Purr and Neighbours.  Overall it was a decent experience but Sunday was when things started to get a lil rough...

I awoke Sunday at 11am still drunk, but showered and met my bro at the Olive Way Starbucks to head to the Seahawks game.  We had a great time and drank way too much beer and headed home to Ma's place for dinner.  We ordered a pizza and then it was off to the Roc to watch Xan perform.  I brought a gaggle of friends (six of us, I think) and found out there was no show that night because the previous night had been some charity shindig that exhausted all the performers (and who said drag wasn't hard work?).  BUT, Xan and I talked to the owner, Scott, who began to set up an impromptu performance, a special private show, for everyone at the bar (maybe 20 people at most).  This was great until it was announced that there was going to be smoking for whoever attended.  Uh, excuse me?  I pulled Scott aside and told him that not only was one of my friend's a worker for the state in Public Health, but why he was allowing smoking at his bar at all.  He was extremely rude about it and defended the smokers, saying they had raised lots of money the previous night and he didn't want them getting cold outside.  Then he walked away from me, completely disregarding my concern for his bar and the health of us.  Needless to say I was EXTREMELY put off by this and ended up leaving the bar with most of the people I'd come with...

I was especially frustrated with the situation because not only had I PLANNED this gathering of people from work and my social life, but when the shit hit the fan, it came in HEAPS.  I had invited Brett and Kyle down and both of them left the club very disappointed.  For that I felt bad and then for Scott to brutally rebuff my concern was just another blow I didn't need.  So, overall, I was and still am sorely hurt by what transpired last night.  I keep being told not to feel bad, that nothing that happened last night was my fault, and although I acknowledge this, I can't help but feel bad that this gathering fell apart faster than a Pauly Shore plot and everybody left in a bad mood, including myself.

But I'll get over this, I have to.  I guess I'm just especially kinda ""bleh"" right now cuz I haven't taken my meds in two days and I've been having awful dreams lately.  Hopefully that will change tonight when I sleep for a good 10 hours (get it while you can).  I had my last final tonight for my film classes which included writing 3 pages of essays in less than an hour *whew!*  Um, I also have to work at the Tacoma Mall twice a week for the next few weeks.  Talk about justified ""bleh.""

Not much else to say.  I'ma gonna watch Signs and get to bed.  I miss a special someone in my life who makes me feel like a real person, like I don't need to worry about anything else but being in his presence.  I dunno what to do about it, though.  The situation is much easier discussed than dealt with, like everything else in life.

"event","Those who know me can decide the relevancy of this.  I wrote it sometime during my time in Spokane, but I cannot remember exactly when.  Let's take a read:

FAR-SIGHTED DISTANCE

Miles apart and still I can't see
Perpetually, I'm stuck on how you are
I'm stepping and staggering through time mindfields,
Dwelling on how you appear from afar.
I should know; there's always been a distance between us
That could never be bridged, not even with love
By words, with passion, none of it mattered;
I epitomized the doubt you hadn't thought of.
Though we both have realized I was not mature then
That I did what was bad for me
You attempted to intervene whenever you could,
But destiny pioneers the path it leads.

The past, it is
Forever will be...
We both just would not see
That the problem was me.
Feel the time
It wounds us internally...
I absorb it entirely
Yet I still haven't learned.

I spent nights with a blaze and thoughts with a curse
Like voodoo, my attention was tainted
With black for a veil and blue as a core
My feelings for you were all painted.
Along came a change-of-pace from guilt and regret
Unexplained and surprising as it was
Fate has a way with catching your eye
And embodying the hope that it does.
I flowed with it, all hands on deck
Until, admittedly, I was still cursed
Finding myself enveloped in you
Whole-heartedly, completely immersed.

See me, search me
For whatever I am...
This charade is indeed a scam
And I sense that I'm damned.
As for who I am
None of this has been planned...
I'm free-falling and soon, I'll land
Shattered with dirty hands.

Nothing in life is set in-stone, I like to believe
People I've hurt, feelings I've betrayed
There must also be a blueprint to life,
A map of mistakes strategically laid.
I've thought over thinking, played through the playing
Fought enough fighting and hoped for the hoping
Though one thing remains to continue to practice:
Cope until there's no use in coping.
Fire away from your far-sighted distance,
Bombs away at my ill-intended flaws
Know that the fury that resinates in your soul
Is the pain that I've carelessly caused.

Step, move on
Be whoever you'll be...
Just remember to always breathe
While chastizing me.
It's plain to see
That distance could play the key
To unlocking the mystery
Of what draws you to me."

"event","Why am I posting?  Oh because.  I've been feeling pretty good the past week or so with the new medication I'm taking for my ADD diagnosis called Focalin.  I tried Adderall and unless you want to act and feel like Joan Crawford a la Mommy Dearest, I strongly discourage ingesting it.  Focalin feels good right now; I'm able to focus better on my schoolwork and engage more in conversations.  I'm also better able to use my vocabulary and use words I normally wouldn't.  That's probably attributed to school, tho, as dictionary.com has become my great friend.

Otherwise, it's just been work and school.  I feel closer with my friends than before, tho I dunno why.  Last night was great fun: dinner at the 5 Spot on Queen Anne, quick stop at E Z Street Records, then pre-funking with Brett and the weekly appearance at Neighbours.  Today has been spent recovering, as I was still drunk this morning and had to endure two buses home.  Blah.  I really want to see Capote tonight, so I'll see if Dee or my mother would like to attend the film with me.

I need to watch the original Night of the Living Dead, too, and write a 4-5 page paper on it for my film class.  Speaking of which, my professor hand-picked me to be in her Film Theory class next quarter, a class she hasn't taught in eight years.  That's a great encouragement because not only was I specifically chosen to be one of only 25 students in the class, but we're going to be required to watch a movie in the theatre every week and write a critique of it and compare with our fellow students.

Dee and I are going to see Fiona Apple in FOUR days and I can't be more excited!  Wait, give it time.  If it's a great show then I'll buy tickets to see her again in January when she opens up for Coldplay on their tour.  Otherwise, not much else to report.  I need to shower and quit festering in this house.

Luv me~"

"event","My phone rings at 1:56am and I answer it.  Terry, my ex, is on the other end whining about how hard school is, how depressed he is in secluded Pullman, how busy he is with two majors and a job, then...how much he misses me.

BACKGROUND: Terry and I dated briefly, maybe a month-and-a-half if I stretched it out from first date to last day.  To this day it was the most intense relationship I've ever had and that was eventually the downfall of us.  He came down with a mysterious illness that landed him in two hospitals for a span of about three weeks where no improvement was being made because the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong (it ended up being a rare strand of mono).  I spent EVERY day he was in the hospital with him, usually before work, and I met his family and watched this illness devestate his body (he's about 6'4"" and at one point hit 150 lbs).  Once he was better, I seemed not to matter.  He began to call less and eventually I had enough and set up THREE different meetings to break up with him.  He continued to flake so we broke up over the phone where I beraded him with ill-intended words that he deserved.

He's in Pullman now and we had lunch at the Harmon one afternoon in early August.  I realized then that he was not the right person for me; he was emotionally immature, inexperienced romantically/relationship-wise, and very materialistic.  However, he has real aspirations and underneath his obvious faults he has a genuine heart and noble intentions.  And, oh yeah, he's barely 18.

I learned a lot from that relationship.  Mostly, I learned NOT to invest that much effort into such a young relationship.  I felt, however, that I had to be there for him.  I WANTED to be by his bedside holding his hand, I WANTED to rub his back when he vomited harder than anybody I'd ever seen throw up, I WANTED to tell him things were going to be alright and stroke his hair while they administered a spinal tap, I WANTED to bring him a coloring book in the hospital and bring him movies, but most of all, I WANTED to be in his life and throw myself at him unlike I'd ever done with anybody else.  And I did all of these things.  And it eventually was all for not.

But learn I did.  I've taken so much from that relationship and even though we ended harshly and I still can't forgive him for how he handled things at the end, I hold no grudge against him.

We spoke on the phone for an hour tonight, the longest we've talked since we had lunch.  He claims he misses me, and we rahashed our relationship and specific memories that make us feel good to this day.  I told him he only misses me cuz he's stranded in a podunk college town neighboring Idaho *shudder*.  But after an hour, he cried and admitted he did love me (back then, not now of course), that I was the best boyfriend he ever had.  I can't specify everything he said, but it was just the shred of light I needed in this murky time in my life.  He's a great kid who just doesn't have the experience to know how to act in a relationship.

We're going to hang out on Thanksgiving after I get off work.  We're thinkin TV dinners and Ben & Jerry's, just like old times.  He's a cute kid and I believe we both just need some attention.  It's been a while.

Luv me~"

"event","As I'm writing in my journal for Writing Effectively, I have developed an intriguing thought and opinion on the state of today's educational system.  The subject of the journal is if I agree with the statement made in the book ""Lives On the Boundary"" which is written: ""Students will float to the mark you set.""  Is this a sign of a deteriorated academic system saturated with underachieving students?  Why is this so?

Here is what I've come up with that's somewhat of an epiphany to me:

Schools offer Advanced Placement (AP) courses, which I see as yet another way to alienate students and offer them the chance at a challenge rather than presenting the challenge to them in a way that would encourage their participation in it and look forward to the risk and optimism to succeed.  Like separating the hopeful from the hopeless, AP classes contrast vocational schools; those seeing these classes as a way to pad their scholastic resumes are still studying beside those who are being offered the opportunity to settle for a vocation.  Where is the guidance?  I REFUSE to believe that the instilled attitudes toward a ""challenge"" is what can differentiate one child from another and determine their chances at critical academic success.


I'm anxiously awaiting someone or some people's response to my argument here.
Thank you.

Luv me~"

"event","Twas a great weekend!  Thursday night Xan performed ""Gimme"" by Jill Scott and ""My my my"" by Armand Van Helden, two of my fav songs that he performs.  Friday I worked then headed up to Seattle to whisk away Badhomo from the big bad city!  Oh yeah, Brettro82 came too, seeing as it WAS HIS birthday we were gathering to celebrate.

We had dinner at Primo Grill, a 5-Star restaurant next to my work.  It's always good and we had wonderful meals.  We proceded onto the Sheraton Hotel here in Tacoma where we had drinks with the entire lounge to ourselves on the 26th floor of the hotel, overlooking the entire city.  It was FABulous.  Then it was onto my house where we had a small gathering of mo's to celebrate Brett's birthday and Aaeron's, another friend of mine.  Xan never made it to the party which was upsetting but we had fun anyway.

Saturday was great as well.  I awoke at 10am to usher Brett on to his day, then crashed back out to sleep off the buzz that followed me from sleep.  At 2pm it was off to the races so Badhomo and Delineator18 and I went to Starbucks for drinkies then it was off to Bellevue where we met their co-worker Elena and checked out the new Lincoln Square.  Wow, that place has lots of money invested in it, though there's not much to see yet.  But we did move on to the Westin Bellevue which was quite nice.  We bickered like old women on a place to eat, headed our separate ways to meet up in Ballard, which we did after Dee and I got lost because my stubborness was convinced I knew where I was going.  In Ballard?  Ha, right.  We finally made it to Sunset Lanes where we met another one of their co-workers for bowling and cupcakes and homo-guessing.  Then we hit Red Robin on the Pier and had quick dinner before Kyle had to run away for drinks and Dee and I headed home to rest our sleepy heads.

Today was simple: NFL football all day, Seahawks winning, then dinner with my Mom and Bro and some family friends at Il Fiasco, a fancy lil place a block from my work.  I had a delectable cherry cheescake and red Zinfandel which was quite yummily floral.  This upcoming week should be busy, as usual, but fun.  I'm testing out my new pills, Focalin, which I hope won't spin me out like the Adderal did.  Yuck, no fun being speedy in class.

QUICKLY: I'm registered for next quarter and I'll be schooling one class Monday-Friday so school ALL week long!  Also, I wrote one of the best poems I've ever written which I'll post when the mood strikes.  What to do now???

Luv me~"

So I'm waiting for the bus to get to school.  The cable is out (or the roomie neglected to pay the cable bill, which has been known to happen) so I'm resorting to a Livejournal posting.  ""Two in two days?  Matt this is exemplary behavior"" Chris Rodkey might think.  Well, yes, it's not-so-much that I have much to say, but important things to say.  I've been thinking a lot about my journal entries for my writing class.  I have encorporated some material from my counseling sessions into my journal; not only does this accomplish the given assignment (10 pages every week on any subject) but it's an extension of the therapy I'm receiving.  Lately the issue has been my father and our absence of communication, thanks to my stubborn self.  I'm working on getting over this, though.

My counseling appointment was quite eventful; I was upbeat and talked up a storm and touched on many sentences my counselor wants me to write about (see above).  Today is also the first say of taking Adderal XR; it's legal amphetamine, basically.  It's supposed to help me focus, seeing as both the counselor and specialist are dead-set on me having an odd form of ADD.  So, all day I've been pretty agitated, but my overall feeling is good.

I was writing a paper for my film class and came across an item of interest in the article I read to prepare for the writing.  The article is about the repression and opression of sexuality in horror films; although it was written by Robin Wood in 1985, everything he says still rings true today and is very-much mind-provoking.  Here's the excerpt:

     Deviations from ideological sexual norms--notably bisexuality and homosexuality.  One of the clearest
     instances of the operation of the repression/projection mechanism: homophobia (the irrational hatred and fear 
     of homosexuals) is only explicable as the outcome of the unsuccessful repression of bisexual tendencies: what 
     is hated in others is what is rejected (but nonethless continues to exist) within the self.

Any comments?

"event","Yesterday was festive.  Printed 25 pages of homework, went to school, then on my 2.75 hour break between classes, with no homework to do, met up with Jake at the top of the Sheraton and had three lemondrop martinis.  We chatted the entire time about my classes, our roomates, etc.  The view up there in the lounge on the 26th floor is FABulous.

Went to my film class and discussed Unforgiven for 1.5 hours.  Went to the Swiss and met up with Jake, his sister, and her husband.  We played pool for just over an hour and headed home.  Why I went to bed at 12:30, I'll never know; that's SO early for me!

This weekend should be a trip: working 2-10:15 tonight, going to the Roc to watch Xan perform, work 11:30-8 tomorrow, going to bed early, getting up at 6:30am on Saturday to get ready to head to Seattle to work at the Huskies game with my manager (they're playing USC, the #1 team in the country; should be WILD), we're not outta there till 7pm.  Then it's out to the clubs with Brett and Kyle with whoever wants to accompany us.  Sunday is the Seahawks game (recreation this time, not work) with my bro and then home.  Then probably the Roc to watch Xan perform cuz Thursdays and Sundays are typically my day to watch him.

*Exhales* Whew, should be fun!
Oh yeah, my head is KILLING me and I have no Advil; me no likey.

"event","So it seems life is back into its usual swing; somebody's on vacation while everybody else is working, some of us schooling (someone's gotta have fun).  My day was the typical Monday/Wednesday; writing class from 1:45-4, homework/writing in my journal from 4:15-6:40, film class from 6:45-9:15, more homework till 9:50, then come home.  Monday night at 1:15 *sigh.*

On a more exciting front, one of my best friends (who lives in Brooklyn) is planning on coming out to see/stay with me in February.  He's been my friend, long-distance, since SEVENTH grade.  Crazy, eh?  I stayed with him for 5 days back in 2001 and haven't seen him since; we only talk every few months yet we maintain a solid friendship.

Dee, Katie, and I are planning a trip to Boston for St. Patrick's Day.  While cruising the U-District Saturday for clothes, I noticed a student roundtrip airfare to NYC for $226.  Crazy!  There's hope for me yet to get to Boston.  I'm so excited, I've never been!

Work is going well; I got another raise (although we all know that ""raise"" is hardly anything to bank on, pun intended) and am working 28-30 hours per week.  Surprisingly I'm not stressed out (yet) with school and work with no car, I'm having a lot of fun!  I still go out when I can (Seattle Saturday nights and Tacoma Thursday and Sunday nights).  I'm working the Huskies game with my manager on Saturday and then going to the Seahawks game against the Cowboys with my brother on Sunday; FOOTBALL WEEKEND (fags reading: move on, this isn't your expertise)!

Nothing on the boy front.  Should there be?  My only exposure to men these days is the clubs and school; do you WANT me to have a desire with those references?  Ick.  My emotions are being diverted a certain direction, but I don't feel at liberty to disclose exactly what's going on.  All I'm going to let on is that I'm content and pleased with the object of my attention.

Luv me~"

"event","From Growing Up Gotti, my (new) favorite show.  I even have the Gotti wallpaper to match on my laptop.  Nuttin too crazy to report these days.  Mondays and Wednesdays I school from 1:45-9:30 (a break from 4-6:30 to do homework; I wrote 9 pages in a journal today.  Ech), then all other days (except Saturday, a wonderful day to have off) I work during the day (since I crashed my car, my manager has been a DOLL in terms of accommodating my schedule.  I primarily work middays now).  Friday night's my night to club, I've decided, even though I'd prefer Saturday.

Still crazy, I'm afraid, as well.  I'm seeing a counselor every Monday and November 7 I go to a specialist who, well, specializes in head meds.  I really need something, it's hard to focus in class.  But I do love school, I love the feeling that I'm feeding my brain food that I hopefully can use in the future.  In my writing class we just read The Gatekeepers, which follows an admissions officer at Westleyan, this primo prestigious school in Connecticut.  It is FASCINATING, I highly suggest reading it if you are at all interested in how colleges choose a handful of students out of hundreds of piles of applications.  Even if you're not interested (I wasn't), I still reccomend reading this book.

I wrote this lil diddy last week in my writing class.  I know nobody reads my space here, but if you perchance do, feel free to comment.  I never used to let people read my work, let alone critique it, but I welcome the suggestions and criticism now; I feel it'll help me grow as a writer.  Here goes:


                                                 
                                             TAKE ME TO THE GRAVE

Slow, like honey
The taste of your tongue lingers like the sting of a salted wound
Spent, like money
My emotions, weary, after a fruitless bloom.

Within my grasp, I had you once
Too great, you were, to stay in my palm-
I disobeyed unspoken boundaries;
A broken bind worthy of psalm.
You swam, so nobly, against said tide
With no one to hold your hand-
Heart distraught and faults acknowledged
You stood ground at your last stand.
Two visions strayed from a single purpose
Both sights set on a bond-
From shambles we walked away,
Two drops of a crowded pond.

Deliberate, with haste
Hands locked, lips pressed, bodies embraced in a test of time
Enduring, your taste
Back into your graces I begin to climb.

Never once did I second-guess
The magnitude of your love for me-
Nor did I consider the resurrection
Of feelings returning eventually.
I've clamored for your attention since,
Short of screaming your name in vain-
Knowing your intentions are not for me,
My reach for you is pained.
Although I feel I'm right for you
Your heartbeat may sound otherwise-
(I've grown too much) I won't take you for granted now
Or drown your ears with tell-tale lies.

Fighting, for real
Prospective endearments clout my already cloudy resolve
Communications, to heal
Our commitment to recovery is not a problem to solve.

Working toward a common goal
Reaching out to stabilize-
My pursuit of you is something new;
You're still elusive despite my tries.
The past holds no candle now
We're feeling our way out through a maze-
If I tell you why I crave your touch
And desire your taste, would you stay?
Unforgiving, regretful, we shouldn't be
Your name past my lips puts me at ease-
I'll tidy up the hope that we
Find solace in a future we both believe.

Sincere, to prevail
Cover me while I attempt to behave
Set-up, to fail
Commit me to your sacred place, take me to the grave."

"event","I haven't been this stressed out in a long time and I've been crazy for TWO months already!  Fuck, school is doing this to me and it's all my fault.  I went out last night, barely ""assisted"" Xan at the bar and warned him not to let us get ""too crazy.""  Haha, we always get ""too crazy"" (no easy nights when you're out drag queens...AND queens), especially on Sunday nights at the Roc (go fig).  I ended up having four rum-and-diet's (no more Whiskey juice for this puppy) and groping the new barback there (he groped me first!).  I woke up at 9:15 this morning buzzed and doped up on my meds (liquor intensifies the effect my head meds have on me but I didn't take them the night before so I HAD to take them last night).  My ma (pronounced the Gotti way: MAH!) picked me up and bought me the three books I need for my Writing Effectively class (one book, The Gatekeepers, should actually be enjoyable; it's very similar to Nickle-and-Dimed, except it focuses on college admissions and how a panel fills 700 spots from 7000 applicants).  I read some, went to my counselor for an hour, then went to the Writing class sans the two-page paper I was supposed to write.  Whatever, I participated in the discussion.  I walked to Hal of a Sub and had lunch in Fireman's Park, wrote in my journal for the writing class and went back to school and read more about college admissions.  Finally shifted focus to genres in the movies then went to the film class with cute gayboy majoring in non-profit in it, watched Stagecoach (circa 1936, with Jon Wayne), and have to write a paper about that by Wednesday.  Now I'm home clacking away on this damn laptop, stressed as all fuck because this day sucks and when I stress, I start going even crazier.

Oh yeah, and I dropped my I-Pod taking off my messenger bag and it's frozen now.  Plugging it into the wall isn't working for it so now it's busted.  I'm pissed.

But now for what this post is pegged as: part of The Gatekeepers talks about race and the role it plays in admitting potential students.  I began rattling off in my journal about how diversity has played such a minut role in my life because spending my life in Michigan (""the white bread of the country""), I knew THE ONE African American person in my elementary school.  Then throughout my academic years in Gig Harbor (6th grade-12th), I knew THE TWO African American students from middle school to high school.  When I got into the rave scene, my eyes were widened and my horizons broadened when my best friend became an Asian woman (I don't like the term ""Asian"" because it's typically used to loosely, that some people believe it encompasses people from the Phillippines and even GUAM) and a DEAR DEAR friend of mine was full-blooded Native American.  Yet throughout all of this, I never second-guessed the character of these people or treated them differently.  Why?  It never occurred to me to treat somebody differently because they were the ""minority.""  People are created equally and I sincerely believe that; we all have the same organs and that's what makes us live, not our skin.

Nowadays discrimination is more widespread with the ""popularity"" of homosexuality.  Granted we have come leaps-and-bounds from where we, as a society, were at the beginning of last century in terms of segregation.  But skin color still does play quite a factor in many people's lives.  I never thought, growing up, that I would become a minority.  Granted I'm a pretty run-of-the-mill white male in Washington, but I'm gay and people have discriminated against me because of that, when even my skin color was the same as theirs.  Like ravers being the reincarnation of hippies, gay people are resurrecting the discrimination once doted primarily upon African Americans (yes yes, I know it's been ""wrong"" to be gay throughout history, but it hasn't received as much attention as it has in the past few decades).

Okay, so I'll step off the soapbox.  And the floor is now open...

Luv me~"

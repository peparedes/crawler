HELL YEA ALL!! this is amazing. we needed a snow day and we got one. i love it. i absolutly love it. i got a facebook tonight....so look for me there. yea....that's pretty sweet. i had to go to the dentist today....i have a caivty...it kinda bites. one of my teeth hurts too from them poking at it. ow!!!  it really hurts. i should prolly go take some advil or something. 

god....is it just me or do you hate when you're like sitting there spilling your guts to someone and they don't even bother responding? it drives me insane!!!! one of my biggest pet peeves. and then when you point it out to them all they can do is say how sorry they are...and they don't do anything to adress what you were talking to them about in the first place. god!!!    

i'm going to go and take some advil and lie down on my bed. bah...life sucks sometimes."

"event","i'm sick of never being noticed. no one talks to me....no one notices me at parties....no guys like me...no one remembers me...i'm the invisible person. and truth be told....i'm sick of it. i'm sick of being constantly over shadowed by my friends like kt and suzy and tessa. no one notices me anymore. 

Example 1:
Meg and Kt walk into cast party.
""hi kt!""
""hey it's kt kuvin!""
""wow kt's here""
""yo kt, u made it""
s-white: ""hey chopped liver"" (but only after i commented on how no one noticed me)

Example 2:
Meg talking to person who shall not be named for their sake.
Meg: ""and then....omg....i was so upset. can you believe it?!""
Person x: ""oh...wait...u were talking....what??""



no more examples needed. i'm the invisible person and it sucks. no one loves me....no one cares....and chances are everyone will forget my b-day again this year.

well...last night was so insanely add. well.....brandon came at like 6:45 to pick me up. we went to rave...no one was there yet. called ppl and everyone was ""almost there"". everyone showed and we decided not to see a movie, so we went to steak and shake. no one would serve us there so we decided to go to starbucks. we went to starbucks and hung out and drank coffee and talked and played games out of this weird as hell book. then we decided to go the park....so brandon and i leave and go there and when we get there, only lyss and matt are there. we call everyone else and apparently they all decided to go over to Ally's house. so we decided to hang out at the park for a bit. brandon and matt spun themselves on the tire swings until they almost hurled, lyss and i almost broke the swingset and we had massive fun on the seesaw until matt got hit in the stomach w/ the grip bars on one of them. lol. we listened to music for a bit and then went over to ally's. watched robots. brandon left like halfway through so matt drove me home. i think i fell asleep during the movie....but it's all good. got home late. crashed. woke up late. so yea...pretty sweet night. got some cleaning to do now. peace and love all. i'll talk to you later.

today: woke up at 8! (yes 8!) in the morning. practice piano for a bit....then went to my piano lesson @ 10. my piano teacher loves me now cause he thinks i actually practice a lot but really i've just gotten an assload better at sightreading. so....yea....that was fun. then i came home for like two minutes to grab the key the ppl that i'm house sitting for's house. went to their house and watered the plants and brought some boxes into their garage and spilled toxic chemmicals on my hand which kinda sucked. then i went home for like two more minutes and vaccumed and stuff and then i went to ritter's and put a hold on a cake and bought a shake and stuff. then i came home and ate lunch and did dishes and then went off the the mall to hang out w/ kt. met kt...did...stuff. ran into kitkat and went to visit erin. ate dinner at sabarro's which was really really good. then it was off to band practice! band was fun....lots of boring frosh stuff though but the new frosh are cool ppl even if they can't march and i <3 all of the other ppl and i got to see old ppl which rocked. then off to skyline w/ david and frosh fazz. tons of fun there. then came home and wrote this while on the phone w/ kt and that's about it. so yea...i'm off to bed.

"event","hello my loverly xanga readers. i'm so sorry i have been neglecting you so. i haven't had much to say....except for the fact that i did leave all of you out on my adventures in drum corp world. if you really want to read all about that feel free to pop by my livejournal or inquire within. whichever...i'm open for anything.

okay...update on the past few days: 

saturday: only noteable things...i went to my sax lesson where my new teacher noticed (and you really are never going to believe this in like 1001 years) that i have a self confidence issue *GASP* hahaha. yea...that was amusing. then i worked. that was about it. oh. and i read harry potter and called kt...but those are givens.

sunday. i went to church. then took erin to wendy's/the bank/her work. then i ran home and grabbed the cell phone charger before running off to kt and smw's voice recital. some ppl sang really well....some ppl sang not so well. kt and smw's duet went really well. everyone cracked up at their costumes. then i stole kt and drove her to rave (smw couldn't come b/c she had to go to this cast party for her sis+this rehearsal thing) and we saw charlie and the chocolate factory, which fyi is a totally awesome and majorly drugged out beyond reason movie. i loved it. danny elfman is my life. and tim burton/johnny deppness is pretty damn cool too. sooo...ummm...yea. don't remember what i did after that. i really don't. oh...i remember now...i got uber depressed and then got reallly incredibly highly happy and called kt and then i watched this amazing movie called impromptu and then talked to kt on the phone until like 3 in the morning and then i went to bed. 

monday: woke up. drug myself around my daily tasks. asked me mater if i could go visit sarah white...mom bitched in response. sent a couple of very emotionally driven emails. went to work. talked w/ mouse for the first time in awhile. came home. talked to kt until 12:30ish. watched dumb tv. drug self into bed.

today: chores. got mom's b-day present. talked to kt and sarah. got and equally emotionally driven response to one of my emotionally driven emails from monday. cried a bit. scheduled next sat prep lesson >_< now: looking for plans to do tonight. 

well...i'm off to go and find ppl to do stuff with. i'll talk to you all later."

"event","so...okay. yesterday=amazing!!!

basically...i woke-up at 10 am for no real reason and just u know...got dressed, threw my contacts in, grabbed a diet coke and drove over to bp to get gas in my car. as i drove past lakota west i noticed that capital regiment was already out so after filling my car up w/ gas i drove over. then i proceeded to wander around for...oh...10 minutes cause i had forgotten to bring mama's cell number w/ me...but...oh well...before i actually found her at the food truck. so...i got pulled onto the food truck and got the quick tour of it...(okay...quick food truck discription...it's an 18 wheeler on but on the inside there are stoves, 3 sinks for washing dishes, 2 freezers, 3 crockpots, 2 ovens, a shower?!, a washer and dryer, and like all the food you could ever possibly imagine) and then as soon as my tour was over she put me to work helping make lunch for the 150 people drum corp. basically my job was to put fruit in the freezer, give fruit to kenny after it was all cold, peeling eggs (which really sucked because someone forgot to dunk them in cold water after they were boiled), going to skyline w/ one of that parents w/ hopes of being able to afford skyline for a meal for everyone (ps...west chester skyline sucks ass!!!!), setting our plastic forks knives and spoons, handing mama towels, setting up the food outside of the food truck and then serving fruit cocktail to all the kids until i had to leave and give erin back the car. I got there at 10:30, i left at 1:30. 

so...ya know. i went home and practiced for a bit, did some psat prep course stuff cause parents suck, watched tv, finished the He's A Pirate arrangment (which ended up becomeing a medley of pirates themes) and playing sax until i realized i needed to go get a new belt. so i called my mom and met her at old navy at like 5:30 and did some quick shopping, got home around 6. called toph back, ate a quick dinner or like 5 soy hot wings and went to pick up toph to drive back to west for capital's rehearsal.

went back to west. this time knew that i'd find everyone i wanted to find at the food truck. saw a bunch of old lakota ppl i didn't want to see, and then (on mama's orders) drug toph over to the corp so that i could brainwash him. unfortunately, the corp wasn't on any of the main fields so toph and i got really really really lost before we did find them eventually. watched them on the soccer field and then we all (w/ the corp) wandered back to the main field for the run-through and real practice. went up and sat w/ mama who tried to get me and toph to go home, grab a sleeping bag and then come back and join the corp for the rest of the tour, him on tuba, me on baritone. parents didn't like that idea though even though i was all for it. *le sigh* but u know...got to talk to mama for awhile, watched the corp being amazing, laughed at mama for her so-called ""idiosyncrosies"", talked about mr. monroe, talked to a bunch of parents on how to convince my parents to let me do the corp next season, saw a bunch of ppl i knew from grade school who pretended they had no idea who i was (i waved ^_^) and basically just had a totally amazing time. after the run-through mama ran back to cook skyline dip for their late night snack and toph and i went back to my car which we had parked over by the other field and then drove back over to say bye to mama (which went really well fyi) and then it was back home for some actual dinner at...oh...11:30 at night. 

so...to sum up yesterday in a box...i spent 12 hours w/ drum corp almost, i MUST join the corp, capital=amazing, and oh yea...mama=perfect.

welp...now i'm off to go buy some new reeds and then practice and shit today for the 6 hours until i leave to go to the drum corp contest in centerville. i will right about that all tomorrow. ^_^ oh yea...and the bf who lives in indiana, he's in dayton for the week...seeing him tomorrow. wel...ttyl."

if you guessed me...you're probably right. i feel like total crap. headache, dizzy, sore throat, stomach ache. no fever..but i still feel really crappy. well...mayb after a long sleep tonight i'll feel better. one can only hope...right?

on a good note though...phillip's mom got a hold of a mark VI alto that she is considering selling and if she does decide to sell i get first look at it ^_^ yay for having a guy whose mom is a sax obsessive too ^_^ i'm excited. if i can get her to go below 2,000 i have to go for it...yea...i don't really have that type of money...but they usually run about 4,500-6,000 and if i can get her to sell it to me cheep i'm going for it. ^_^

well...off to finish packing. driving home tomorrow....12 hour drive home. *sigh* at least i have plenty of movies to keep me company and more than enough cds to make me happy.

today: looks like it might be another stromy north carolina day. :( it's quite saddening..but i can hardly walk anyways because of two giant blisters on the soles of my big toes. it's quite depressing. today will prolly be a day of laying out in the hammock reading salinger. ^_^ man do i love salinger. ^_^ very muchly. also...i've been having the worst pain in my neck and i can't crack it...it's really pissing me off. going to try to get a massage from my sis later to see if that helps. i hope it does. 

tomorrow: leaving at 7 in the morning for the 12 hour drive back to cincy. if you wanna do something either that evening or the next day, call me on my dad's cell if you know it....or just call my house and i'll check messages on the drvie home and get back to you. well...i'm off to actually go wake-up, get my salinger, and head down to the beach before the rain comes. ttfn.

ANYTHING. i'm working from 12-5 today, but anything after that, i'm in. call me. please. just call to talk. anyone. i miss people.

Also...please pray for the family of the driver, brandon barkley. brandon's younger brother was also in the back seat of the car and is now in the hospital with (what i have heard to be) three broken ribs and a broken collarbone."

"event","so yesterday i went to rachel's kids of broadway preformance. it was pretty good. the younger kids weren't all that great...but the older once were amazing. one of the girls is like in the final selection process for hairspray so...needless to say she was really damn good...and there was this senior guy that was really good...and rachel...needless to say...amazing!!! ^_^ her solo was great even though the soundbooth was dumb and didn't turn on her mic until after she had already started singing >_< dumb parent volunteers. 

things i learned: 
the lion king song really doesn't sound right when you have the same kid singing zazu and simba...really...he sounded like he was controdicting himself...i knew wut he was doing but still..>_<

odd crossdressing guys who were ""an actress on broadway"" are really creepy when they come up and hug your friends (yea...rachel...that was creepy...)

parent volunteers make really bad soundbooth people



yup...that's it...meg needs to go to church now...love u all ^_^"

then band. band was decent. got to help rachel look like a whore. that was fun. tomorrow i get to see her look like a whore and get a lipstick mark for it! *w00t* anyone who wants to ocme see rachel look like a whore...call me b/c i might need a ""date"". hurrah for transposing music today that i had no idea how to transpose for so i made something up. yes...i made it up but it worked. then there was this huge issue like i had gotten a ride home set up for after band w/ mama but erin didn't know that so she was ""being helpful"" and got me a ride home w/ rachel that i didn't need and that was some weird unneeded stress there...yea...finally just went home w/ mama b/c that's who i told my rents i was coming home w/. sorry rachel.

ride home was fun. really...a lot of fun. i learned a lot about mama...really...like i totally forgot how paranoid she was...lmao...but really...it was fun. i love her so much. it was fun...i'd do it again...it wasn't odd either...i thought it might be...but it wasn't...it was normal. ^_^ okay..meg's off now. ttyl"

<P>HOLY FUCK!!! ppl wonder why musicians are so friggen poor...i have a great answer for u. mayb it's because i went out about a week ago to go and buy reeds. any guess how much money it cost me to buy 15 reeds??? any guesses...anyone?? $40!!! forty fucking dollars!!! for 15 reeds out of which i might find mayb...hmm..4 reeds that are actually worth having and playing on!!!!!!! that's basically ten flippin bucks per reed...totally not cool. plus it totally pissed my dad off...so...yea...if meg hasn't already spent enough money traveling w/ the jazz band to where ever we're off to play next, and buying music for lessons and just in general b/c, hello...ppl i need music, let's go and have meg spend more money just to afford reeds to play! totally not cool.</P>
<P>other badness...i hate how whenever we have to do the whole ""say something good about anyone else"" the only thing anyone can think of for me is music. yea...music is a flippin big part of my life...but it's not all there is to me! and by the way: music is not geeky..i have no trouble supporting my fact that i like band so don't try to tell me i'm a strong person for standing up for the fact i'm in band...........................end rant</P>"

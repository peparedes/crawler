"event","How can I be angry when it's my fault? 

Chugging down coffee, but I'm not sure if even caffeine will help me get through today.  The buzz from the weekend is wearing off, and nothing really looks good.  My room is a mess somewhat like my life.  I can't keep up with anything anymore.  Days blur together and I can barely even remember the nights.  I wonder what happened to me.

I'm tired of everything.  I'm tired of the drinking, the fighting, and the questioning.  It was so easy in the beginning.  How could something that was so obviously wrong be so completely perfect and right?  He was engaged but yet it felt as if he belonged to me, always.  I religiously checked my email and couldn't stop smiling when I would see one from him.  Meeting at secret bars, lying to everyone, sneaking off to vegas.  The universe made it loud and clear that we were not supposed to be together, but nothing could keep us away.  Not her broken heart, the distance, or the secrets.  

Love blindsides you.  It was perfection.  The ex's, the fights, the lies, the age...none of it really mattered because when everyhting comes down the only thing that mattered was that he was still there and we were together.  Then I woke up one morning and realized he was gone.  Cliche, but it feels like a punch in the gut.  That doesn't do it justice.  

How could I have let someone, something so perfect just disappear.  The worst part is that it is all my fault.  Self inflicted pain, no one to blame but myself.  The amazing part about love is that he was not perfect, our relaitonship wasn't perfect, but to me he epitomized perfection and so did our relationship.  I pulled away and pushed until it was too late.  And as the buzz wore off I realized that all I wanted was him, but it was too late.  

I can't eat, sleep, or even function.  They say time will heal everything, but how can it possibly heal when I lost the one person I was meant to be with.  If it's meant to be it will be.  I hate that saying.  What if it is meant ot be, but because I fucked up so much it can't be.  

I know I can live without him.  I know life goes on, I know I will still smile and laugh, but I dont want to.  I don't want to live without him, I dont want to have a life without him in it.  I don't want to smile or laugh without him.  


When I told him I loved him I meant it, but it was about a month after that, lying in bed next to him when everything really changed. We had just finished...he was jumping up from the bed every two seconds  to pace, a habit that would normally be annoyingly excruciating to be around, but was endearingly adorable when he did it.  He came and sat on the bed in between one of his paces, and I felt like someone plowed me over.  I swear the wind was knocked out of me.  I loved him so much.  I wanted to crawl inside him and stay there forever.  Our world was perfect and it would never could never possibly end.  

This is not what I wanted.  I lost the one person I thought I would have forever.  Hurting.  A broken heart cannot be described. Now all I have left is time.  Time to wait.  Wait for him to be ready to love me again.  Wait for myself to go home.  Wait for him to get over me and find someone new and break my heart.  Wait for us to be together again.  Wait for the tears to dry.  Waiting for something. 

Love like that can't go away.  I've loved him my entire life and always will.

"event","I'm blogging. Is that even a word? I've entered into a new realm of dorky technology. An online journal...I feel like Doogie Howser.

Finally back at school, attempting to escape the drama that engulfed me at 4615. Bill the bartender at Gabriel's of course helped through harsh nights.  I think Susan even got a chance to meet Bill one night, while she was attempting to prove I was with someone other than A.Pops. Mission accomplished.  She should join the goddamn FBI. Amazing talent....but kinda scary/creepy. 

It feels glorious watching someone else deal with gay ass bullshit (VAL PAL!!!) instead of me. HAHAHA...sorry Steph.  What is it with these chicks? ValPal epitomizes everything wrong with women.  Her and Brooke. Brooke sucks at life.  I wish I was big enough to only mention that much, but I mean come on.  Maybe she is drop dead gorgeous with a perfect body and has the confidence to pursue some guy she met at a bar, but doesn't it get to a point where self-respect and pride kicks in? I mean how many times do she have to be told ""no"" until she actually leaves him alone? She looks pathetic. ValPal also looks pathetic.  As sad as it is to feel like you've lost the only thing that matters and as much as you want someone to be yours when they aren't, pathetic is the last thing I could ever stand to be.  I hate all that feminist bullshit, but what happened to just being a strong person?  A few drinks and she just cant help but call, leave texts, and voicemails multiple times in one night.  She is totally under my skin. Val Pal and Brooke should join evil forces. 

Seriously, I'm in ex-overdrive.  New screen names, new puppies....what's next? Girls are crazy. And so manipulative, sometimes I am stunned at the cunning wits displayed by my fellow women.  Typical breakup scene: Boy breaks girls heart.  Girls rids every memory she ever had of boy.  The one i deal with...girl, who remains not named, manipulates boy with as much guilt as she possibly can, I would add up the tab, but it's overwhelming.  Who would want a new puppy to remind them daily of the boy that broke her heart? She completely manipulates him to keep him close to her.  I know it sucks to hurt, but doesn't she get that it's OVER. She knows she pisses me off, shs is getting exactly what she wants.  How do guys not realize how completely manipulative girls are.  It's never like it seems. Asking someone to buy you things and take care of you when you are completely self-sufficient? Where's the pride and self-respect.  She doesn't need him, why is she keeping him? They're all crazy. 

An even better team ---> Brooke (just dumb and pathetic), ValPal, and the nameless Queen Bee, who just might be the smartest of them all.

Week one at school ---> I find myself scrubbing the guys' apartment bathroom, due to one to many games on one-on-one beer pong.  That was an all time low I think.  But on the bright side, I think my beer pong skills are really coming along this semester.  One semester left --->SuzyCollege.  I don't think that in 4 months, after graduation, a cubicle job allows much time for flip cup, beer pong, and vodka on a daily basis.

On that note, I'm out."

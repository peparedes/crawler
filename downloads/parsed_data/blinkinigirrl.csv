this semester has really helped me put a lot of things into prospective...like, i dont want to major in business, im broke, i need a job, i need a new car, i need to get organized, and of course, i need to pass and keep my scholarships. boooo.v and lets see, ive probably royally fucked up many relationships and friendships ive had, because im broke and i cant afford to go places (like cornell and gt) im sorry i dont know what else to say. im a bad person, i know, i need to be like restrained from life.  :( 

 

ok well on a brighter note, juan and i went to the new amsterdams show at northstar last sunday.  i like that venue alot.  it feels like the troc to me, and i love LOVE LOVE the troc.  good times there.  anyway, im glad juan hasnt changed, i mean he has, but surprisingly for him, in a good way and i can stand to hang out him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

im done, i miss everyone, but i love being away from home.  its amazing.  amazing. need i say more? although i have been craving a trip to the beach, i dont care how cold it is or will get, i need the smell of OCEAN CITYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

 

 

im going to art class now :-D"

<P><FONT face=""Franklin Gothic Book"" color=#3333ff>so today at work (<EM>meadowbrook</EM>), jen and i are putting the nuts in containers (<U>literally</U>), and this old man walks in, holding his ass.&nbsp; he asks jen and i if we have a bathroom because its ""<STRONG>an emergency</STRONG>"".&nbsp; jen and i answer politely ""yeah but its only for employees"". well, this guy, doesnt take no for an answer, walks back and starts asking steve, the owner, where the bathroom is, still holding his ass mind you.&nbsp; steve, after much hesitation, lets the man use the bathroom.&nbsp; 15-20 minutes later, the man emerges from the room, and just walks out. no goodbye, no cya later, no notthing.&nbsp; later on, steve goes into the bathroom to empty the trash and finds a wonderful present left for him.&nbsp; dare i tell??? well, in the words of the great <FONT color=#339999><FONT size=4><STRONG><EM><U>TOM DELONGE</U></EM></STRONG></FONT>,</FONT> soiled undergarments.&nbsp; yes.&nbsp; steve, being completely italian, completely loses it, and i must say, <FONT color=#ff0000>mike dunican</FONT>, you picked an awful day to take off. hahaha.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=""Franklin Gothic Book"" color=#3333ff>i would now like to aplogize to everyone that offended, but im sorry, it had to be told.&nbsp; and many of you are probably wondering <U>why</U>, but its kinda like&nbsp;a <EM>had-to-be-there-thing</EM>, but the fact that the old man was tear-ing and steve was still hesistant just made work at meadwobrook all the more meaningful for me.&nbsp; can you tell ive become a <U>very <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>angry</STRONG> </FONT>person</U>??</FONT></P>

if you analyze this whole livejournal thing, it almost contradicts itself.  it calls its a JOURNAL but in reality how many people actually log in thinknig ""im going to write everything im feelnig down so the whole fucking world can see it?"" not many im guessin, so wouldnt a better name be ""here is what i want you to know, not what im actually thinking""

"event","midtown friday so im hearing?? and a nice hour of power to kick off the events haha....troc shows are SOOO much better with the involvement of alcohol if i do say so myself, even tho my last show at the troc was awesome and it was alcohol-less (i guess thats just what matchbook and yellowcard do to a person)  anyway, sully was almost run out of his house by floods =-O, jackie told sully to hit a deaf girl tonight, and bowdens choice of ferris bueller was supurb.  but the highlight of the day was deanna losing her phone in the enclosed field, and making friends with JAY whose apparently 20...but turning 21 next week (deanna makes new friends everywhere we go...) no game today  and work tomorrow >:o...beach thursday tho :)"

"event","today has by far been the slowest day this summer has seen yet.  between work, hours of non-stop rain, and my exhausted self not doing a singel thing tonight other than watch eurotrip and i love the 90s with brandon, its definitely been a waste of a day.  its not even 12 yet and im yawning.  theres no progress in life.  ive degraded myself to diet barq's root beer and teddy grahms.  i walked around acme with a pink lai.  i am constantly tired and all of my cds are in north fucking carolina with my mother's daughter.  tomorrow i have to hike down 70 to shawnee, to play shawnee (i think) and to get our asses kicked, only to come home tomorrow night tired as fuckin hell most likely!!! ahhh remind me not to EVER act this way again!"

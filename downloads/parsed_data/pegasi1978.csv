"event","So I've already had half of one strand of lights go out on the Christmas tree. I replaced the offending bulbs (more than 40) and was quite pleased with myself.

Then tonight while I was in the kitchen talking to the hubby who was standing near the Christmas tree I notice there is another half strand of lights out on the tree. *Headdesk* At least when I bought bulbs to replace the other lights, I had the foresight to buy extras. I was just hoping that they wouldn't get used until next year.

I'm procrastinating replacing the bulbs right now because my fingernails get chewed up taking out the bad bulbs. That and I'm worried that I won't have enough bulbs to go around. Last time I had to go to three different places before I found the bulbs I needed since it is so late in the season...hence why I bought extras to begin with.

And before someone suggests just replacing the strands of lights, it's kind of hard to do when you considering it is a pre-lit tree."

"event","I just refreshed at one of the adoptable sites/forums that I frequent and noticed that I had a PM. Thinking it was in response to a note I put in my signature a few minutes before I clicked on it. I stared at the message I received stunned to say the least. It was from one of the moderators of the forum (in fact the head mod) and it said:

<i>I've got a question to ask of you. We are in need of new moderators; thinking about who might be up for the job, we (that is, me and the other mods) came up with your name and therefore I would like to offer you one of the open positions.

The decision is completely yours; no one will think less of you if you decline, and it certainly won't have any consequences for you if you do. Neither do you have to answer immediately; take your time to think about the offer and give me your answer when you are sure.</i>

My jaw hit the floor to say the least. I'm flattered that they thought of me. I never thought of all the times that I tried to help out others on the site in various ways (such as answering questions, pointing out a previous version of a thread existed, et cetera) as anything other than me being myself. 

Since I don't work I tend to be on at random times throughout the day, which can be a good thing. I try to keep a level head when talking with other members of the site. It's a volunteer position, so I'd be doing this out of the ""goodness of my heart.""

I'll be doing some heavy thinking for the next day or so that's for sure. I also plan on talking this over with my husband. I may contact one mod who stepped down previously and find out a little more about what their time as a mod was like."

"event","Last year, I tried to hide one of hubby's unwrapped Christmas presents in Gavin's closet. Things worked well until one day Gavin called to Daddy because he wanted to show him something. Hubby realized upon entering the room that it was probably the present I hid in there and made a break for the door before he got a good look at it.

Late last week, hubby came home and before entering the house had me hid in our bedroom. He then went to to hide an unwrapped Christmas present for me in Gavin's closet. This morning, Gavin called me into his room and pointed at something on the shelf he wanted to play with. Knowing hubby had hid something in the closet, I stayed where I couldn't see it and reminded him that it was supposed to be a Christmas present for Mommy. He closed the closet and started crying. 

A little while later hubby called to chat a little before going in to the class he's taking for work. I told him about what happened and he chucked since Gavin pulled the same thing on him, that he had pulled on me last year. He asked to speak to Gavin, and reminded him (again) that the thing hiding in his closet is supposed to be a gift for Mommy. I tried not to listen when Gavin said, ""But I want to play with the 'XX' thing"" since I don't want the surprise ruined, but I have a pretty good idea of what's hiding in Gavin's closet and I can't wait to see if I am right.

Oh and if you couldn't tell by this post, I'm feeling much better from the cold I had last week. The muddleheaded-ness is mostly gone, along with most of the stuffiness. It's nice to feel ""normal"" again."

"event","I'm thinking the changing weather has pulled a doozy on me. I spent most of yesterday evening feeling a little run down and eventually my throat started hurting a bit. I went to bed at my normal time and slept hard. I didn't want to wake up this morning, but I had to take Gavin to school. When I got back from that I crawled back in bed and slept until about 30 minutes ago. I still feel blah, but not quite as blah as I did when I went to sleep. I just hope I'll be able to sleep tonight. 

And I was supposed to go grocery shopping today."

"event","With laundry I mean. I've been doing the laundry today since the basket was fairly full and I didn't want to worry about it when my parents arrive tomorrow. As I was changing the towels out in Gavin's bathroom, I noticed the clean towels had a musty smell. I decided to check the sheets for the spare bed as well. They were musty too. Rather than have my parents use musty towels and sheets, I tossed them in to be washed...adding two loads to the routine. Needless to say I'm tired of folding things. Right now the dining room table is covered in folded whites, most of which will be put up in a few minutes.

I also cleaned the master bathroom and vacuumed the computer room and the dining living room. I plan on cleaning Gavin's bathroom in the morning and possibly vacuuming his room as well. There's still some things that could stand to be put away, but I'm not bothering with it now. I got most of the house picked up and that's the important thing.

The Christmas presents for Mom, Dad, Piet, Shannon, Lorren and Breana are all wrapped and waiting to be taken back ""home"" when Mom and Dad leave. At one point Piet had said they would try to send a birthday present for Gavin with Mom and Dad, but from what Mom said earlier tonight I think they forgot about it. I'm not surprised. 

I need to sit down with Gavin soon and get him signing the Christmas cards. I just don't want to overwhelm him. There's 15 cards to be signed so I may try to get him to do three at a time. That doesn't seem too bad does it? I don't plan on mailing the cards until Dec. 1 at the earliest so there's plenty of time still.

Well if I'm going to get any rest before my parents get here tomorrow I need to be getting my tired self in the bed. Night!"

"event","Back on April Fools Day I mentioned the fact that <a href=""http://pegasi1978.livejournal.com/274733.html"">Anita Blake was going to be turned into a ""telefilm""</a>. According to the author's blog this morning, <a href=""http://blog.laurellkhamilton.org/index.php/site/the_tv_show_on_ifc_is_not_happening/"">the tv show is no longer happening</a>. I was always wary about it...morbidly curious to see what sort of a train wreck might happen, but I don't have to worry about that anymore.

On a semi-related note, added the latest <a href=""http://pegasi1978.livejournal.com/271776.html"">book I've read to the list</a>. I've slacked on my reading for this month, no real reason...although adding books on the Christmas list has slowed the purchase of new ones to be read. Now I have to actually look through things that are on the shelf and decide what I want to read. It's not a bad thing, since there are several books that I still haven't read since I bought them, I just haven't been in the mood for any of those. 

It's almost lunch time and Gavin said he's hungry so I'm going to see about fixing something for us to eat after I pick a new book to read. Later!"

"event","So a certain little someone turned five on Thursday. Still hard to believe that it's been that long. We had the family celebration on Sunday. 

<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b235/pegasi1978/Gavin/gavin_5th_birthday.jpg"" alt=""Gavin blowing out the candles on his fifth birthday cake"">

Caught him blowing out the candles! Or I should say attempting to since I was evil and bought trick candles that re-light after a being blown out.

Then on Thursday we took cupcakes into his VPK class. We have lots of leftovers since I got two dozen. When the class started at the beginning of the year there were 18 kids. By the time of Gavin's birthday the class is down to 15 (and after Thanksgiving break will be 14). Got the kids sugared up just before going home for the day. *LOL*

He might not have gotten lots of presents for his birthday, but Gavin doesn't want for anything. I didn't want to have to deal with the headache (or expense) of doing a party that invited his entire class. Smaller is always better in my book.

I'm working on getting the house ready for when my parents arrive Monday. I went grocery shopping yesterday and laughed at the fact that most of what I bought wasn't going to get eaten until Thanksgiving. Mom requested game hens so I picked up four to cook either in the oven or on the grill. I've been wanting a cobbler for a while so I picked up a berry one (along with vanilla ice cream). 

We'll be doing a late lunch/early dinner due to hubby's work schedule. Just means we have an excuse for a late brunch. 

I might see about pulling out the Christmas tree and decorations while the folks are in. I just hope we don't have as many lights out on the tree as we did last year (I'm probably jinxing myself by even mentioning it). We don't know quite what our Christmas plans are yet, though hubby does have the entire week off so we could travel if we wanted to."

"event","Remember how we <a href=""http://pegasi1978.livejournal.com/269465.html"">took the In-Laws computer in for service</a> this past winter? Well it's likely infected again. When you go online, do a search and click a link it goes to a different page than the link you actually click. You also can't run the anti-virus program...nor can you un-install/re-install said program. The only way to salvage the thing is to do a recovery, which can't be done without recovery discs that the computer can't burn right now (so a professional would have to wipe the hard drive like last time). Anyone know if HP recovery discs from one computer will work on another HP?

We warned my SIL last time that she couldn't keep adding crap on Facebook/MySpace or downloading crap from random sites on the internet. Did she listen?

They dug out her old computer to use right now and are having minor issues, mainly stemming from the fact that it has Windows ME/IE 4 on it. *Evil grin* Facebook/MySpace can't load on it. They can't even really upgrade the software on the computer since XP isn't supported by Microsoft anymore and there's no way the computer can handle Vista.

Only good thing out of this is it reminded me that I need to make recovery disc for the laptop and the desktop. I've made the ones for the laptop (at the same time discovering it has a DVD burner...I just thought it had a DVD player/CD burner not a DVD player/DVD burner). Haven't made the ones for the desktop yet as I expect it to tell me to use DVDs as well and we only have one left since the laptop took two. I'll check it out later though. Last time I made recovery discs was for our old HP and it took 7 CDs so two DVDs was a nice change.

Not much else going on. Picked up Assassins Creed 2 for the hubby yesterday. He was quite pleased with it and quite disappointed that he had to go to work and so couldn't play the game for very long at all (less than 30 minutes). We'll be going later today to pick up the God Of War Collection. Sneaky vendors releasing it on Wednesday instead of Tuesday. I should have kept my mouth shut about the GoWC and then I could have given it as a Christmas present, but I figured hubby would hear about it from somewhere else. Just meant that we got to trade in the old GoW games early.

Since I can't give him those games for Christmas it just means I have to be a little more creative when it comes to ideas. I still have a few in <a href=""http://pegasi1978.livejournal.com/263864.html"">the list I made previously</a> (and keep updating), just have to go for something that wasn't on an idea list given to family."

I really ought to grab Gavin's birthday presents and see about wrapping them while he's at school today. It will be my last opportunity to do so (without waiting until after he goes to bed that is) before his party on Sunday. That won't take too long and then I'll still be wanting to do something else.

The sad thing is there are things I need to do around the house (like some cleaning) but I don't want to do them because it's so nice outside."

I'm doing my best to have all the shopping for my parents and my brother's family done before my parents come over for Thanksgiving. That way when they go home, they can take the presents back with them. Then there's no need to pay for shipping!

So far we haven't spent that much on Christmas and that's a very good thing. We have an unofficial budget of $50 an adult, $25 a child. So far I've managed to stick to the amount or come in under it! Nice to know we won't be breaking the bank. Of course the budget for Gavin and hubby's gifts are a little higher, but even then not much higher.

We've been having beautiful weather since Tropical Storm/Depression Ida passed through. Last night was a little cool, but not bad. Tonight is supposed to be about the same. I can handle weather like this that's for sure."

"event","Well the sore ear did turn out to be an ear infection. Poor Gavin, first he had H1N1 and now an ear infection. Strange thing was there was no fever with the ear infection, just the pain. He's on amoxicillin for the infection and children's motrin for the pain and/or any fever.

One thing hubby noticed (and I later unknowingly confirmed) was if we mentioned the ear infection Gavin would have to go puke. If he doesn't think about it he's fine, but mention the words and he's making a bee line for the bathroom. It's not a good thing when he needs to keep the medicine down so he gets the benefit from it. This morning after he had drunk most of his chocolate milk (and kept it down) I gave him his medicine and just told him to take it. He didn't argue and since I didn't remind him it was for his ear it has stayed down. Now if I can remember that trick with the rest of his medicine.

I spent part of the morning working on new address labels because we were almost out. I decided to add some holly leaves and berries to some of them for Christmas cards. The rest of the labels just have a decorative ""H"" to help take up space on the label. ""Yea!"" for having short name and address lines. *LOL* We had two sheets of labels left so I went ahead and printed both of them out. I'll worry about getting more address labels when we're on the last section of the second sheet.

While I was digging out the labels for printing I finally found the instructions for the LCD tv so now we can double check what we can and cannot use to clean the screen. I also found the manual that went with the car seat we gave Mindy and Nate for Zander as well as the instructions for the child seat on the back of my 10-speed. Since Gavin is approaching the 40 pound limit, will be getting his own bike for Christmas and I don't see myself taking Zander out on my bike, I'll be taking it off and possibly donating it. I feel bad because it only got used once or twice since my parents bought it, but it has all the parts and is wonderful condition so hopefully someone else can use it.

I need to get busy with some house cleaning as my parents are planning on coming in the week of Thanksgiving. Need to find some new ""homes"" for things that got moved out of the garage due to Ida. More than likely the attic for them. I need to remember to keep the stuff that I plan on listing on ebay inside and go ahead and do it. Before I can list anything I need to check on shipping materials. I've also got to see about updating my amazon listings. I found a few more books that I don't care to keep."

"event","*lol* Now that Tropical Storm Ida came ashore, she's moving very slowly. She came on shore near Dauphin Island, Ala. She's out over Mobile Bay and should make landfall again soon (I'd imagine near Foley, Ala.). I've looked at the projected path on the National Hurricane Center's Web site and she's gonna slowly creep across the Florida panhandle, with the storm's ""center"" being over Florala, Ala., by midnight tonight. Top winds are down to 45 mph and further weakening is expected as Ida moves inland later today. We haven't even had any rain for a few hours now according to hubby. Everything's just overcast like any other rainy day.  :)  We ended up not bothering with the hurricane shutters (and I'm glad for that). Only had a handful of neighbors who broke theirs out.

While this is my first hurricane living in the Florida panhandle, I've been through one before - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Opal"">Hurricane Opal</a> - which caused damage all the way to the mid-Atlantic states before dissipating. It's a bit different down on the beach though.

I will say I am quite glad that last year's hurricane season and this year's hurricane season have both been so quiet. Just means we really need to be ready for next year. We kept putting off getting our hurricane kit ready and I don't want that to happen next year.

Gavin woke up at his normal time this morning and has complained three or four times that his ear hurts (same one everytime) so I'll have to keep an eye on that. Hope it's not the start of an ear infection."

"event","If I disappear for a few days it's because Tropical Storm Ida is supposed to be moving right through the area where I live. As of Noon CST Monday the center of Ida was located about 115 miles to the southeast of the Mouth of the Mississippi River or about 220 miles south-southwest of Pensacola, Florida. A turn to the north is expected this afternoon followed by a turn to the northeast tonight. I live less than 30 miles east of Pensacola (in the general direction of the expected turns). 

I just spent some of the morning moving things around in the garage so we can fit both cars inside. Been meaning to do it for a while anyway. *LOL* School has been canceled for tomorrow (the kids are out Wednesday for Veterans Day). Only thing left outside right now is the garbage can which will be dealt with later. We haven't put the plywood hurricane shutters up just yet, will likely do it this afternoon.

Things aren't too bad right now. A little wind and light rain. Depending on things we might pack up and head to my Mother-In-Laws for the night. She lives 20 minutes away, but inland!

Lorren is wearing the Rainbow Brite costume my Mom made for me back when she first came out. Ignore the witch on Lorren's cheek. The school didn't know they planned to paint a star on that cheek later in the evening.

We had a good time trick-or-treating. We started at Publix which gave the kids one of those re-usable bags with some goodies and then went through the different departments where they were handing out candy and had different activities. Lots of tossing games (decorate cookies, toss coins in a cauldron, toss ghost beanie in basket, fish for candy, toss pool dive ring around 2-liter coke bottles, ""bob"" for rubber duckies).

After Publix we went to the mall and trick-or-treated from store to store. We actually got asked to have our picture taken twice! It's a new experience for me since I've only ever been to one convention and I didn't dress up for it. I didn't mind and neither did hubby. We were some of the only adults dressed up too. Poo on the rest of them, as that's half the fun. I could have done without seeing three guys show up dressed as two of the Teletubbies and a cross-dressing Robin. That costume was way too small for him. Sorry no pictures of that, didn't think about it.

After the mall we went to a Trunk-or-Treat at a church. Last year they had a photographer there and we were hoping they would again this year. Unfortunately they didn't. Oh well, it was a little more candy for Gavin.

We finished the night off the same way we did last year, dinner at McDonalds. So how was everyone else's Halloween?

And now I get to use my Prince of Persia layout I've been hanging onto."

The family will be going as Mario (Gavin), Luigi (hubby) and Princess Peach (me). Hubby and Gavin's costumes are pre-fab. Mine would have been, but the one I ordered didn't fit so I'll be wearing the first ren faire dress I ever made. I'm actually glad of it because it's only 62 right now and it's supposed to get a bit cooler as the night goes on. In fact I need to go get cleaned up as my sister-in-law is on her way over to pick some things up.

I will definately post pictures."

The Halloween costumes arrived yesterday. Hubby's fits okay (if anything it's a little big). Mine however is too small across the bust/neckline area. Needless to say it's being returned. I can't even exchange it for a larger size because it was the largest size they had. Poo on them. This is why I really hate buying things without being able to try them on first.

I ordered the costumes just before the cut-off date for ""exchange of different size of same costume,"" so I should get my money back. The person I talked to on the phone couldn't tell me if I would get store credit or if the money would go back on my credit card so I'll just have to wait and see. 

So while Hubby and Gavin will match in their Mario and Luigi costumes (which is more important anyway), I'll look a little different in my ren fair costume for the Princess. Still need to find a blonde wig, and now I need a tiara as well."

"event","I'm grumpy for no apparent reason right now. I want to read a book, but I don't really want to go back a finish the one I started before I picked up the last book I read. I also don't feel like reading anything that's on my shelf right now. Can't go get any new books until after payday on Friday.

I want to work on a fox cub plush I recently ""bought"" but I don't have a thread that is the right color for sewing it together. The orange is too bright and the brown is too dark. I don't really want to have to buy any thread either because that involves going to the craft store (once again after payday) since my Wal-Mart is stupid and doesn't have a sewing department (or carry craft paints). They also don't carry cross-stitch supplies. They do however carry yarn for crochet. WTF is up with that? Nothing against crochet, but WTH are they going to carry those supplies and not the rest of the sewing related craft supplies? Oh and I need stuffing for the little guy.

I have to take Gavin clothes shopping this weekend as he's outgrown all his long-sleeve shirts and pajamas (except for one of each). He also needs a new jacket. It's nice that he's finally outgrowing some things, but did it have to be all of it at the same time? At least today/tonight is the major cold day of the week so he can wear pants with short-sleeve shirts and a jacket until we can get some new clothes. I'm not looking forward to him trying things on this weekend. He tends to lean all over me rather than standing up on his own.

I really ought to get back to work on some Paint-Your-Owns that I have, but I just can't seem to get up the gumption to. I get discouraged sometimes looking at how beautiful some of the other Windstone forum folks can paint their pieces and my pieces look childish in comparison.

I'm not looking forward to shopping for Christmas presents this year. I have lots of ideas for hubby and a few for Gavin, but I have no idea what to tell anyone to get me. I'd ask for books or movies, but family always ignores those suggestions. Other than that there's nothing I really want or need.

I've been having a hard time falling asleep the last few nights. I toss and turn for hours before I actually fall asleep. I think it's adding to the grumpiness. Some nights it's because my mind is racing, others it's because I can't get comfortable. I wonder what tonight is going to be.

*Pauses to think if there is anything else to gripe about* I think that's about got it for now. *Glances at the clock* Damn it. It's still too early for me to go to bed. Now what am I going to do for the next hour or so?"

"event","This week I'll likely be going a little stir crazy.  

Gavin wasn't feeling well over the weekend. He'd be fine in the morning, but as the day progressed he would slow down and feel warm. He was getting sick obviously. It seemed like he was getting better by Sunday evening, but I was going to keep him out of school Monday to make sure he was fever free for 24 hours before he returned (it's school policy).

After coughing in his sleep most of Monday night he woke up on Tuesday feeling warm again, so I called the doctor for an appointment. Gavin was perky during his appointment so the doctor thought it was just something viral and gave a prescription to help with the cough. After he got a dose of his medicine though, he slowed down again and spiked a fever.

This all happened around the same time I get a call from my MIL telling me my nephew Zander has type A Influenza (this is what the CDC is considering <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/H1N1FLU/"">H1N1</a> to be). Since he and Gavin played together for a bit last Tuesday and Wednesday, I call the doctor's office back with this news and play phone tag for a bit before they say bring him back in for a flu test.

Ten to 15 minutes after the nasal swab we find out Gavin has type A Influenza as well. Of course my MIL and my mom take that news hard because of all the media hype, but all he has is this season's influenza. There really isn't any difference between H1N1 and ""normal"" influenza.

The stir crazy part of this week comes from not being able to occasionally go out and do things since I don't want to spread Gavin's germs all over or expose him to other germs that might make him sicker.

I stopped by his school this morning to turn in his doctor's excuse (he's out until Monday). I also turned in his ""Star of the Week"" poster as well as some money for a class t-shirt. The TA said that maybe they can have two stars of the week next week since he's out this week."

Gavin had a homework assignment (or rather we did) for this weekend. The kids will be learning about the letters E and H next week and the teacher asked that we send in pictures of things that start with those letters in the folder that comes home every night. I printed out a picture of Elmo, 2 of Eeyore (one has a heart balloon), a horse and the cover of Disney's ""Hercules"". 

Hubby and I had a blast discussing things we could send in, but decided some might be a little out there. We missed the assignment for last week (P and D) due to being out of town for the wedding. Would have sent in pictures of a Phoenix, Pegasus and Dragon for sure! Can't wait to send in Unicorn, Griffin/Gryphon and other classic mythological creatures.

Speaking of Gavin and school, he had a very good week behavior wise last week. He started with two 3 fish days, had a 2 fish day and finished the week with two 4 fish days. So only one bad day! And the reason he got one of his fish on the first 4 fish day was he ""used his words rather than his hands to communicate."" Meaning rather than hitting someone to make them leave him alone he said ""Please stop."" Needless to say we had a special treat of ice cream at the ice cream shop on Friday afternoon after school.

My oldest friend would probably be Beth. We've known each other since 1989 (Holy moly that's 20 years!) when we were in my Mom's Junior Girl Scout Troop (Troop 347!) together. I was in a different Cadette at first, but when that troop broke up I joined the Cadette and Senior troop Beth was in. Beth's a year younger than me. She was one of the bridesmaids in my wedding.

When my family moved to Auburn in Fall 1994, Beth and I didn't see each other as often (since we weren't in the same Girl Scout Troop anymore. We still talked on the phone occasionally though. When Beth had to do high school Summer Band Camp at AU, she spent the week at our house and drove over to her classes for the day.

Then a few years later when she had tickets to Dragon*Con, she asked me if I'd like to come along with her and her parents. I said yes and had a blast. Still want to go back some day.

College came and we still talked occasionally, though not very frequently. Whenever we did though it was like we just hadn't seen each other for a few days. I even chuckled a little when I found out how close Fort Stewart was to Savannah because Beth was going to the Savannah College of Art and Design. We were within 50 miles of each other again and yet we still only got together two or three times while we lived there.

I'll admit that since we moved to Florida I haven't talked to Beth, but I wouldn't be too surprised to fine our relationship would be like the old days (and I wouldn't be surprised if it changed as well).

My friends to tend to stay the same year after year, but as I move to new areas I do make new friends (slowly). I haven't made any new friends here just yet, but then I have been a bit of a hermit. I did get one lady's phone number at the playground last year so we could get our boys together to play, but I never did call her (and she didn't call me either).

I need to break down and make a Facebook account and see who I can reconnect with from my childhood. Sad thing is unless my old friends who were girls list their maiden names I probably won't find them."

Maybe it's because of going to the birthday party yesterday afternoon. Boy I bet they are wishing they had today's weather yesterday. Sunday is living up to it's name. The party was lots of fun, even if it was overcast (no lightning or thunder). The party hosts had rented a blow up water slide and bounce house for the kids to play in. Gavin climbed to the top of the water slide twice before he finally got up the courage to go down on his third trip to the top.

There were a lot of people at the party and I would say there were only a handful of kids from the VPK class. The rest seemed to be friends and family. A lot of the adults were in the living room watching a college football game on tv. TV wasn't even turned off when doing cake and presents. To me, that's very rude.

Seeing what the parents went through I'm not sure if I want to invite the kids in Gavin's VPK class to his birthday party in November. (FYI: If you send the invitations home through the school you have to invite the entire class.) Because of where we live, we wouldn't be able to have the party at our house (there's be no real parking). Add in the fact that his birthday is in November and it's iffy on doing a party at the park/beach (even though we live in the Florida panhandle). We can do something like Chuck E. Cheese, but that means driving to Pensacola. It also <a href=""http://www.chuckecheese.com/parties/birthday/birthday-details.php?Id=65"">gets expensive</a> quickly.

Gavin got invited to a classmate's birthday party this weekend so I've got to go pick something out for a five-year-old girl. When I called to RSVP (the mother really appreciated that by the way) I was told that the little girl isn't picky so I'll probably do my classic little girl gift and get a My Little Pony. Have to spread the pony love! If I don't do MLP I might do Strawberry Shortcake. I still find it hard to believe how much those toys have changed since they were first introduced when I was a child. Even pound puppies are coming back slightly different.

Booked our hotel room for Tobias and Meghan's wedding today. I'm so grateful for the Internet. They listed five hotels on their wedding Web site.

While waiting we also saw the sign about <a href=""http://www.alabamagulfcoastzoo.org/slideshow_outback_encounters/outback_encounters.html"">Outback Encounters</a> and <a href=""http://alabamagulfcoastzoo.org/slideshow_lemur_encounters/lemur_encounters.html"">Lemur Encounters</a>. We decided to see if we could add those in as well (they didn't need reservations). The woman who does the outback encounters was out so they weren't happening, but we were able to get tickets for lemur encounters. 

There were four ruffed lemurs - two black and white named Tarzan and Jane and two brown ones named Tiki and Twitter.

The lemurs were very childlike, jumping this way and that. The loved chewing on my watchband and giving lots of kisses. Their fur is very soft (reminded me of alpaca wool) and their hands are incredibly warm to the touch. We hung out in the lemur tent until the weather started getting bad and the zoo worker was asked to bring the animals indoors to somewhere safer. We headed to the spot that our tiger encounter was to happen to wait.

They brought the tiger cubs to an area know as ""The Pit"" in a kennel carrier. The cubs weren't real keen at getting out at first.
<img src=""http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b235/pegasi1978/agcz/DSCN2351.jpg"">

They gave the cubs some time to get used to the pit again before coming to get us. Gavin played follow the leader through the glass.

We eventually got to go in and were told to sit down and try not to be to rowdy. The rowdier the people are the rowdier the cubs get. They are 8 week old snow white Bengal tigers, the rarest of the four Bengal tiger color morphs. The boy had darker face markings and is named Kashmere. The girl (who has very little in the way of face markings) is named Kismet. Their stripes are as dark as they are going to get.

I was surprised by how much their behavior resembled that of house cats. And holy cow, the size of their paws. Easily the size of my palm. Their fur is coarse. It reminded me of horse hair.

I also have a short video you can hear Kashmere talking in. If I can figure out how to get the video off the other digital video camera I'll try to add it as well since it's longer (about 6 minutes).

"event","Gavin did better in school today (3 fish) and we got a nice note that he's doing great at making new friends. It was also clarified that he did end up with 1 fish yesterday. We asked the TA this morning about what happened yesterday and she said there was some sand throwing, some tussling over a toy someone else had that Gavin wanted (fits in with what he said about hitting because he was mad) and something else that I've forgotten right now.

I'm hoping that this past week was just the ""growing pangs"" of starting school.

Gavin's excited to be going to the <a href=""http://www.alabamagulfcoastzoo.org/"">zoo</a> on Sunday. I still can't believe that we are going to get to <a href=""http://www.alabamagulfcoastzoo.org/slideshow_tiger_encounters/tiger_encounters.html"">""play"" with tigers</a>! The digital video camera is all charged up, we just have to figure out how to use it. *LOL* It was a 30th birthday gift that stayed in the box until now (a little over a year later). I just hope the weather cooperates and stays nice."

"event","So Gavin's behavior at school this week hasn't been the best. The teacher does a thing with fish on a penguin. Every child starts the day with three fish. If they are good or do something nice, they can earn up to three more fish. If they are bad, they take a fish off.

Monday was a four fish day. 
Tuesday was a two fish day.
Wednesday was a three fish day.
Today was a no fish day. <i>(Though the teacher only wrote reasons for why two fish were taken off; so unless there was something else, today should have been a one fish day.)</i>

Hubby and I decided that if Gavin want to play his video games he has to come home with at least three fish. Any less and he can't play until his next behavior report. I'm thinking of adding in if he wants to play video games on the weekend he must have good days at least three days out of the week.

Right now Gavin is resting in his room since he came home from school. I told him we would have a discussion about his behavior when daddy gets home. To say I'm disappointed in him is a given."

<a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112312561"">'Reading Rainbow' Reaches Its Final Chapter</a>

I'm saddened to see this iconic series come to an end. I remember watching it when I was a child (didn't realize that I must have watched it when it first started in 1983). It was always so fun to see what adventure LeVar would go on based on the featured book of the day. I even remember an episode where they visited the set of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" since that was LeVar's other job.

So ends another piece of my childhood I never quite thought would end."

"event","Gavin has finished his first week of school. He seems to be enjoying it and only gave us one morning (Thursday) of ""I don't want to go to school"". His attitude did an expected 180 when we got there though. He seems to be making friends quickly and tends to look for certain ones when we get there in the morning.

He seems to be a little less picky when it comes to eating. He actually ate bacon, scrambled eggs and an M&M pancake for dinner last night with minimal fussing. He didn't want the eggs or bacon at first, but hubby convinced him to try them and Gavin was surprised to find them good. He even cleaned his plate with minimal fussing. If this had been a meal we were eating before he started school we would have heard much more noise out of him.

He has a special treat for finishing his first week of school. I'm waiting until Hubby/Daddy gets home from work before giving it to him.

Next week will be interesting because it is when we will start getting the daily and weekly reports on his behavior. Right now we are going off him telling us he's been a good boy and the teacher not having anything bad to say when we drop him off in the morning.

Also this week I finally heard back from the doctor's office. They got the results of my lab test for Varicella (chicken pox) antibodies. As I expected, there weren't any so they scheduled me to come in an get the first shot. It hurt more than the Tetanus shot I got recently, but it hasn't left a lump on my arm like the Tetanus shot has.

And I think I'm gonna get off now. I'm getting a little grumpy for no apparent reason."

"event","Yesterday was the first day of school (pre-kindergarten) for Gavin. Hubby asked if he could go in late so he could come along. Things were incredibly hectic (expected) at the school when we got there and we almost couldn't find a place to park...a must since we have to sign Gavin in each day. We finally found a spot and headed to the area we were to drop him off...to find more chaos (expected). Since it was the first day most of the parents waited around until the kids were lined up for the walk to the classroom. Gavin did very well...no tears at all, but then again he never cried when I would leave him at child care either.

Me, on the other hand, I was a little teary eyed on the drive home. Once hubby was off to work I puttered around the house for a bit before I decided to run some errands that are much easier to run without a preschooler at your side. I've been wanting to get a new pair of jeans since the pair I have is loose in the waist. No luck there though. I may be smaller than a 14, but I'm not quite a 12 yet and I refuse to stuff myself into something that is too small. I need to get back into the exercise thing (I've been slacking the last few weeks) so I can actually fit into a 12 sometime soonish.

After that I went grocery shopping, once again a task made simpler that you don't realize it would be. I came home put them away and then had a few minutes to relax before it was time to go pick little man up. I realized I was running early, so I stopped to get gas. I got to the school right on time and waited until Gavin was brought to my car. As I was sitting waiting I heard a familiar voice say, ""Is that mommy's car?"" I look up and there's Gavin with a big grin on his face. I help him in the car and the first thing he tells me, ""They had toys there!"" I took that as a sign that he enjoyed himself. When asked he did say he had fun and was a good boy, but he didn't really elaborate on what they did, so I'll have to wait on the teacher's report.

This morning was much smoother with the drop off. I even left five minutes later and still got him there at the earliest time he can be dropped off. I might leave another five minutes later tomorrow and see how we fair then. I already know I'm leaving five minutes later this afternoon than I did yesterday so I'm not quite so early.

So right now I'm just waiting for Nate to get here with Zander. It will be interesting to see how watching him goes now that Gavin isn't here for him to play with. I knew Gavin kept him occupied a great deal of the day, but I don't think I realized just how much of his attention Gavin kept."

"event","Since I've become an adult I've developed a bit of a fear of doctors. I can't even say why. I know it's important to have regular check ups, but I never seem to schedule them.

With Gavin starting school Monday I decided it was finally time to schedule the appointment for me to be vaccinated against Varicella (better known as Chicken Pox). Since I haven't seen a doctor since we moved from Fort Stewart (and I forgot to grab copies of mine and Gavin's medical records) that meant I had to dig up the family medical history.

I called my mother to get the majority of the information that I would need, but I knew there were probably a few holes in it, so I went looking online for a adult (family) medical history form. I found two very good ones: One at the <a href=""http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/464/adult_history.pdf"">American Medical Association</a> and one at <a href=""http://www.harvardvanguard.org/info/AdultMedicalHistory.pdf"">Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates</a>. After looking them over I gave my mother another call and filled in some more blanks.

I have the AMA form printed out and filled out so I can copy the information onto the forms I know I'll be getting at the doctor's office in about an hour. I'll be filing a copy of the form in the important documents notebook that we have on hand so I don't have to do all of this all over again.

I can at least say I've had a fairly boring medical history myself. I had one seizure as a baby; a broken arm at 8 years; two broken teeth at 9 or 10; got glasses at 11 or 12; had my wisdom teeth removed at 19 or 20; gave birth at 26.

If only the family history was so simple. Cataracts, cancer (breast, liver, lung), chronic sinus infections, depression, type 2 diabetes, epilepsy, glaucoma (a great aunt), heart attacks, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, stroke and rosacea all run in the family. Most of the diseases are in my grandparents, a few are with my parents siblings (can still be relevant though).

It will be an interesting session with the doctor to say the least. Gavin should enjoy it. He gets to see mommy get a shot. I might want to ask about a Tetanus shot as well because I think the last one I got was before I started college back in Fall 1996."

Hubby would be the exact opposite I think. Isn't that the way it goes sometimes?
 
We didn't end up getting to role play yesterday afternoon due to unexpected complications. Instead after short naps we headed over to the In Laws to play some <a href=""http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/"">Munchkin</a>. I ended up getting really pissed off in the beginning of the first game and quit, but I joined back in after that game was over. The second game lasted forever (and it wasn't just because we were eating dinner at the same time). Tossing in the <a href=""http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/dementeddungeons/"">Demented Dungeons</a> deck made it so much longer it wasn't funny.

We're another day closer to Gavin starting VPK (7 days and counting). He's got new sneakers that should be easier for him to get on (he still needs to learn how to tie them though) than the Converse sneakers I bought him a while back. He was having difficulty with them since the heel didn't have anything making it stiff and he couldn't pull the back over his heel because of it. He's got plenty of T-shirts (even if I take out the smart-alecy ones). Shorts he's okay with. We'll have to see about getting long-sleeved shirts and pants (with adjustable waistbands still) when it gets cooler. What I would really like to find (and not just for Gavin) is a rain coat, but I can't remember the last time I saw one for sale in the store. And with Gavin being such an odd size I really need to be able to try a raincoat on him so I know it will fit.

Need to go check on little man. I don't think he's feeling too well this morning. Also need to get ready for Nate to get here with Zander."

"event","Added another book (""Last Watch"") to my <a href=""http://pegasi1978.livejournal.com/271776.html"">books read in 2009</a> post. I finished it last night and after sleeping on it I'm still iffy on if I liked the series or not. That's not always a good thing for me because that indicates a very low re-reading factor. Now I need to go scrounge up something new to read.

We're getting lots of rain right now from Tropical Storm/Depression Claudette. I don't mind it too much because we still need it. Need to keep an eye on Tropical Storm/Hurricane Bill's projected path.

I need to go run a few errands so I might add to this later.

<b>ETA @ 0915</b>
I'm back from my errands. I found it funny that as I drove west along 98 I was driving out of the rain. Kind of sucked when I had to turn around and drive back into it to finish my errands. I thought about getting milk yesterday when I was at the store, but I knew we had close to half a gallon in each (hubby and I drink 2%, Gavin gets whole milk). I didn't expect us to go through so much milk in an evening. I didn't mind stopping though. It let me pick up some other things that the store was out of.

While I was driving past <a href=""http://www.thezoonorthwestflorida.org/"">The ZOO Northwest Florida</a> I saw their marquee said ""Come say goodbye to the Zoo."" I knew they had been having some financial troubles, but I didn't realize it was that bad. Once I got home I went digging to find out what the story was. The financially troubled facility is closed (as of closing time Sunday) and will shut its doors to the public permanently unless Santa Rosa and Escambia counties each give $125,000 by Friday.

If they don't give it money I will be a little sad, but I've never been terribly impressed by the ZOO NWLF, even before it took the beating from Hurricane Ivan (that it still hasn't recovered from). It's hard to be impressed by a zoo when you've been to the <a href=""http://www.tulsazoo.org/"">Tulsa Zoo</a>, the <a href=""http://www.montgomeryal.gov/index.aspx?page=254"">Montgomery Zoo</a> (why the heck doesn't it have it's own Web site?) and the <a href=""http://www.omahazoo.com/"">Henry Doorly Zoo</a>. Heck it would give us an excuse to finally check out the <a href=""http://www.alabamagulfcoastzoo.com/"">Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo</a> (one of the next closest zoos at 50 or so miles away).

The rain is finally starting to lighten up, which is good because it means our Internet connection will stabalize some more...something that is needed if we are to roleplay via Skype later this morning."

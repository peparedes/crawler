"event","so this one was supposed to be my entry yesterday. i guess i can make it short. i was glad that i'm finally settled with my classes. There were many conflicts as classes started. I ended up talkig to 8 advisors and half said that i need to take chem and half said that i dind't. it was a BIG deal cuz i can be held back by a full year. well anyway, i'm not taking chem. haha i actually bought the book so then i had to return it today. damm aldz, he interrupted me ahha. we were talking about badminton. o yah today's my bro's bday. hapy bday man. 
i talked to my fmaily tonight. it's kuul. haha my sis michelle was sleeping already and i tlaked to her just to say bye and good night. let's see.. i broke my retainer... sucky. that's 350 damn. hahah i just figured that's it's better to tlak to ppl individually, i'm not really kinto typing my journa ah. that's not a good attitude haha. 
ok about today, the highlight was the badminton tryouts. well there isn't really a try out since any one can join in. they evaluated us so that we can practice with players who are in the same level. rahul doesn't wanna join. i think i will tho. it'll be fun. hm.. ya they accept 12-15 ppl for the team.. theyre's no way that i'll make it. too many other ppl beter than me. o yah, i'm meeting more ppl again. i ahven't been meeting that many new ppl lately. dats y it actually matters.  ok that's about it for today - still got lots of work to do and looking forward for the fall fest  and to go home this weekend"

"event","hm woke up at 9. eh i wanted to sleep in but i keep waking up early bcuz my classes start at 8 on MWF. But on T/Th, i have classes in the afternoon. I  guess i can do my homework in the morning. Well anyway, it's a sunday and i haven't gone to mass ever since i came here. So the plan was to go to the welcome mass at 12 for the catholic commnity. After showering and everything, i cleaned and thought about  what i'm taking home next week and wat i need to have wen i come back. I finished one of m homeworks, the one for MAE, which is Meachanical and Aerospace engineering. I wasn't sure if the mass was supposed to be at   12 since i wrote down on my paper that it's a 4. Too bad for Joel, i told him it's at 12 and i couldn't contact him. So  i was pissed bcuz teh shuttle doesn't run on weekends and i didn't know that. So i walked a lot to see if the mass was at 12, and i found that it wasn't and wlaked to michelle's apartment to study there. I got food on the way and talked on the phone to my family (every1 except my bro cuz i talked to him online). Studying at michelle's apartment wasn't productive. THe mass was kuul, i dind't think i'd actually go to mass here in sd, so that's unexpected. They had free BBQ and i love free food haha. Then i walked michelle back to her aprmtnet. it was really cold, well for her, i was ok. By the time i got home, i wa tired just cuz of the walking. I've finished all my work except for calculus, damn it i forgot my calc. i don't even know the basics. it's really bad, i feel that i don't belong to this class. so i really need to go home and get my notes. hm i think i'm going to sleep now, since ihave to wake up early. 
o ya, i thought of having my own accoutn of livejournal so my sisS and bro and eveyr1 else can have thte chance to read how my college life is. so there ya go."

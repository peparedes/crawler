"event","THIS WAS MY SPRING BREAK!!!
Thursday- Decided to skip out of work and go to church with Jason. I never thought I could enjoy church, but I actually did. Then the pastor saved me in Jays driveway. Went to Daves later on. Him Sam and Kate were there and we all chilled.
Friday- Good/Bad day. I got to spend it with the best 2 people in the world, Jay and Eugene, along with some others. I got drunk though which was bad, cause I couldn't drive home. Mommy was mad. But there was nothing she could do. hehe. I got sick and Jay took care of me. He is the most amazing guy u will ever meet
Saturday- Skipped out of work again cause I was hung over, then went to sleep at Jays all day. Eh boring. oh well. 
Sunday- Easter. I woke up and ate. Then I slept all day. I felt really sick. It sucked
Monday- hmm... me and Jay went to Eugenes. We sat there for 2 hours talking about what we were going to do. We did nothing so we left. Then we hung out with Dave and decided what to do for another two hours. So we went home. 
Tuesday- Went malling. Bought new shoes. Went to Jays.... I always do the same thing.
Wednesday- Went with Jay to see Eugene and Debbie. We broke down on the side of the freeway and got towed. Then we finally got out there 3 hours later. Learned how to commit a felony on this day. Learned it was pretty cool but theres no way i'd do it myself. Then we had a lot of money so we bought pointless things
Thursday- Van broke down again. We got it fixed. Got more money. haha. Worked. Hung out with Jason. Bought more things. 
Friday- Debbie left Eugene. Me, Jay, Dave, and Dianna met her and made her feel better. We went to the mall. Then Debbie and Jay came over and stayed the night. We stayed up all night talking about sooo many things. God, the bible, ghosts, holy ghosts, acid, Debbie making up stories. oh yeah. great.
Saturday/Sunday- Went meijering at 7 in the morning. Went to work 9-530. Jay was suppose to meet me. I thought he was betraying me, soon to find out the next day it was cause both our phones were turned off. So I went out to Eugenes. Me and him chilled at steves for a while, then we went back to his house just the two of us and had a few beers. It was really nice to be feeling the exact same thing as someone. And it was awesome to be with him without Debbie for a change cause she really fucked him up. So anyway, lots of crying involved that night for the both of us. Steve and others came over and shit went down. Eugene beat his good friend's ass. We had to leave. Went to Dennys at 4 in the morning and complained to the waitress about our problems. He broke his finger. man o man. Then we slept on the couch at his ma's house. Then I took him back and went to work. I only stayed for like an hour and a half though cause I was so upset about Jay and I felt sick n shit. so I got off and went back over eugene's and we watched cruel intentions and went to sleep. Man I missed my buddy so much and he's finally back. I'm so happy. I trust 2 people with all my heart and thats him and Jason. It sucks when one is missing and its rare when both of them are there. Man I love them though. so fucking much. ok i'm falling asleep now"

"event","WARNING:
This is going to be extremely corny.... I think. 
Please someone tell me what to do

So some very amazing/akward things have been happening to me. It started last Friday. I was hanging with my buddies over at Mikes house and me, wasted, told Justin to come over. So he showed up with Jay and this was the first time I'd saw him since we broke up and I realized how much I still care about him, even though I didn't say a word to him. Then about a week passed. Things were going awesome. I finally felt happy and satisfied with myself(not that I dont anymore). Then I had this dream that Jay called me and I woke up and I was sad.
That night Jay called. This was the first time i'd talked to him since January and what a coincidence that it just happened to be right after my dream. hmm. Anyway, maybe it was seeing each other that made him call me? I dont know. But either way it happened. Usually when I havent talked to someone in a while things are ackward, like I dont know what to say, or hey it should have been really uncomfortable because of all the shit that happened, but things just felt so familiar. Its not even possible to describe how I felt for the whole three hours that we talked. It was like my whole heart poured out, all my thoughts, things I never thought I would discuss with anyone came out of my mouth like it was nothing. I dont know. 
So today I hung out with him. It was just like it used to be... so fricken amazing. We did absolutely nothing. I just feel so comfortable with him and its unexplainable but it makes me all excited and like... drunk i guess u could describe it as. and well u know what? I think that is something that people dont feel very often. I think that should mean something, or maybe i'm thinking too much of it.  
The only reason that i'm worried about this is cause i'm scared. I have finally gotten my life together. I'm finally happy. I finally have good friends that I can count on and well basically i'm just having a pretty damn good life. Then him calling just changed everything for me. Dont get me wrong, i'm so happy that it happened and that we are talking again. I'm just afraid that if something happens with us, I'm afraid I will lose everything. If me and him got together and this happyness never changed, my life would be a blast, but you know what, that is most likely not gonna happen so I can keep on dreaming. But now I think that i've just come to the conclusion with myself that just having that feeling for the shortest time will be totally worth it. I've never had regrets about the first time and I dont think I ever will. 
So wish me luck with whatever
I just hope it all works out for the best"

"event","Hello. Its Friday night. Guess what that means?
YES I get to get drunk by myself. Its the new tradition.
So I am pretty bored. I had a good ungrounded day today. I woke up this morning and went to Melissas cause my ass had nothing better to do. Melissa is nuts. Just let me tell you.... Anyway yeah then I went to see Mike and Sara cause they are back for the weekend. It was sweet over there. Sara did her sisters and Mikes highlights and they look fuckin goofy as hell. Then I went to work and came home. Now i'm bought to do some homework cause i'm fuckin crazy. 
Anyways, let me just tell you... my life has been like so much better lately. I'm still in the process of learning who my real friends are, but its ok cause at least now my family is here and we are getting along. I dont want to kill myself or leave home anymore so thats a good thing. Maybe its just the fact that i'm single is why i'm happy. Men make me crazy. So yeah. This guy from the Navy is coming to my house tomorrow to give me some info. I might actually join. I'd be sweet to travel the world and make a bunch of new friends.
ok well i'm going to go now cause this is fag"

So yeah another interesting thing, some girls tried to jump me at work the other day so I called the cops. One day they are going to be reported missing and no one will ever find them cause they will be fucking buried in my back yard.

"event","Whoa....hey there!
So I havent been online for about a month now. Thats pretty sweet.
I've been having weird days. I guess i'll tell you about them now:
So uh i've been hanging out with all these people..... and they are sweet.
Started going out with Zackery.... pretty sweet
Me and Zack had a eating binge for about 2 weeks. I gained 10 pounds back. 
Ash Wednesday- smoked a lot of cigarettes to celebrate.
Got in a lot of trouble for no apparent reason
Ran away from home
Got picked up on the freeway.....
Mom thinks i'm on drugs so i'm going to take a blood test for her to get her to shut the hell up. Her drug of choice to blame me for doing: extacy 
Its going to be cool when it shows up all clear and she leaves me alone
I stayed the night at Zacks.... and with permission :)
Zack and Corey stayed the night. I passed out. Woke up when scarface died and Zacks like ""i'm crying look"" it was silly. 
I love scarface by the way
Got a letter from my uncle from jail
He's going to beat andrew hendersons ass for me :)
... and ryan hood
uncle also thinks i'm on drugs cause andrew talks shit in jail. heh hes not going to survive for 2 1/2 more years. 
got lost cause i got off at the wrong harper... that was silly. ended up at like 7 mile. then somehow on southfield freeway. that was scary
i keep sneezing 
I went to the psychiatrist today
Adderall is coming soon.... :) :) :) next thursday if i'm lucky
went to zacks today
went to mikes today
went to melissas today-she is ridiculous by the way
went to school today
cleaned my car today. That was awesome
My dad threw zack out of the car
Zack grabbed a baseball bat
It wasn't a good night

aight i'm done listing gay things. but yeah so my life has been good except for the parental part. I cant stand being accused of things that arent true. Apparently I smoke crack, do heroin, and do extacy everyday. I almost killed myself. Zack saved me. By being there.... I dont know. My life sucks. But its better now. Cause it doesn't consist of much... thats how i like it i guess. Got lots of friends.... only hang out with 3... zack corey and kelly. go to work, go to school. Things could be better, but i'm happy. 
Anyway i'm going now. I'll be back when I feel like it. Maybe next month again or something sweet like that. Gimme a fricken shout on here... or i'll kill you"

-Almost got shot... yeah I wont talk about that. But it was silly.
-got drunk for the first time in a few months. passed out on the floor. I really hate drinking.

-Computer broke
-Me, Stacey, Chelsie, and Heather made plans to hang out. I'm actually really excited cause I never hang out with girls. :) aw were homies.
-Got threatened by Amandas family over the telephone cause they thought I was the reason she was cutting herself and had to be put in the crazy house.
-I went over there and made friends with them today. They let me search their house.
-Went to premeire. Hated it. 
-Forced to hang out with Jon and retards. Hated it.
-Jason told me he has more respect for me than any other girl in the world and that he thinks i'm the most beautiful girl he's ever saw. Then we just stopped calling each other. Its been like 2 weeks now....
-Passed 1st semester! One to go and i'm done forever!
-Met Zack's mom. She told him he did good this time. haha. Then she called me.
-shot guns a lot
-shot adam at kroger on a driveby. haha it was funny. we hit him in the forehead.
-zack called in for me and said he was my dad. they didn't believe me, but I got them to. 
-I got stranded. Christina was coming to get us and she went in the ditch. heh. So we walked around in the cold and finally found a ride home from someones mom. 

Ok i'm done. Well at least for now."

I'm in a bad mood today. My tounge is messed up. I messed up several things last night. Well actually i've messed up throughout this whole weekend. I messed up Jasons care for me. Oh wait he doesn't care anyway so it doesn't matter. I weirded out Eugene. I had a phase of thinking that a hideous person was attractive for about 5 mins. I got pulled over AGAIN. Wasted all my paycheck. Hmm what else.... who knows. I hate to say it, but I need to stop doing whatever the fuck I want and stop to think about things before I do them. I'm so spontanious and compulsive. Maybe its a mental illness. I hate the way I live my life. Its boring and pointless for me to be around. 
What should I do to mess up my week this week? Suggestions please....
So umm my tounge fucking hurts. Thats all I can think about. Doctors tomorrow. Hell, maybe its from smoking. Doubt it. Maybe I wouldn't do it so much if people didn't piss me off so much.
Yeah. I have a problem right now. I need to see a psychiatrist or something. But the thing is, i'm embarrassed to talk to anyone about my problems because people dont care. The only thing that will come of it is me making myself look bad. So I hide my problems inside of me and I get like this. 
I wish people were like me, or that they understood me. I wish people didn't change. I wish it was 3 weeks ago all over again. I wish I remembered what happened this weekend. I wish life was as me and Jay called it ""Acoona Mattatta"" again. But after these past two weeks, i'm not sure things will ever be the same again. I messed up way too bad. But I dont blame it on myself. I blame it on everyone else for not caring. For being bad friends. Friends are suppose to be there through everything. Not just shit that they feel like caring about.
Everyone at school doesn't give a shit about me. They think i'm some sort of horrible person or something because I have a life and I have fun. Yeah maybe I get into trouble and do stupid things sometimes, but you know what? You have to get through rough shit to fully appreciate life. I learned that by doing it. Then you have people who sit at home and cut themselves and want to die when they have perfect lives. Richmond is so weird. Then I go anywhere west of richmond and people love me. Too many of them. They are like bugs. They need to stay the fuck away. I dont really understand. I guess Richmond is just not the place for me. Who fucking cares I get out soon. Fuck all yall i'm moving out the country to live by myself or do something good for this world.
The thing that frightens me the most though is that when I get out of school, i'm afraid that I am going to fuck up even more than I did these past two weeks. I'm afraid that I will ruin my life, and all because of other people. 
The only thing left to do is change. I will have to train myself to completely not care about anything. Then at school i'll be able to sit in a corner by myself and have a damn good time. That is the worst thing possible to say, but I have to do it in order to be happy. I cant be around anyone to be happy. The only way to be happy around people is.... well I cant tell you because ur prolly a fucking idiot. You know what? If I told u you'd prolly go and talk to all ur little friends about it and be like hey look what she said look how stupid she is. Yeah not directed on anyone specific, but most people are that way. If your not then I probably havent met you yet.
Ok so that is my deep thoughts for you. Oh wait you dont understand because you are not me, but its ok. I dont blame you for it. Whatever I need to shut the fuck up. YAY LIFE!"

"event","So today was a good day. A lot of bad things happened but it turned out being awesome. 
This morning I went to Jays at like 9 and went to sleep with him for a little bit. I missed him last night so I needed to. Then at like 1130 I left to go turn my portfolio into scholastics and ok no one ever told me we had to have a fuckin cd of our work on it. Of course I didn't have it and dont even know how to make one. blah. So they said they will judge it but it wont get sent to new york. How gay is that. PRETTY MUCH.
So then after that I went to work. I felt kind of queezy and lightheaded at work today. Actually all day I did. Sall good now though. 
Anyway, why i'm telling you about my day in this many details I dont know. But whatever. So after work I went to get Justin and me and him went to get clay for my locker presentation. ew. Right now i'm excited to do it though. Then we went to mcdonalds. My mouth was so dry today the onions on my cheeseburger were literally getting stuck in my mouth. When I was done about 5 mins later I was playing with my mouth and I kept pulling out unchewed onions. haha. no one cares but I thought it was funny. 
So then we went on our way to get Dave and Jay. As soon as I got there Daves like I gotta go get my half gallon. I was about to smack him, all he ever wants anymore is to be fucked up. Its not like he has a bad life and needs to. Its just dumb. DUHHHH. Anyway so since he offered me gas money I took him over there. Free gas and i'll drive around the fricken world. So we got there. Same gay people as last night which was soooo stupid. Me and Jay left and went back to his house. It was seriously awesome to finally be alone with him. We hadnt been alone together in days. So we just cuddled and smooched n stuff. It was cute. He has the prettiest eyes i've ever seen. I will never get over them they are wonderful. 
So anyway, now i'm at home. I finally got some adderall so I can concentrate on my fricken homework. I'm actually really excited to do it now. I have such good ideas for it. I decided that I can not use adderall forever though. Even though it is a wonderful thing. I need to learn to always be on adderall, but actually not on it. What i'm saying is that I need to get more modivated. Its like, when I dont take it, i'm lazy. Its not that I want to get bad grades, I just physically cannot get off my ass and spend time on things. Thats why I love adderall so much. I remember shit I learned in 5th grade without even thinking about it. I'll just know. I wish it was like this all the time. Minus the lack of sleep. Thats the only bad part. I always feel like theres things that need to be done and I cannot let myself sleep. But hey i'll change the subject now.
I just want to talk forever. Hopefully Jay is coming to get me soon. I missed him before he was even gone. The time we had together today was absolutely amazing. Every time I touch him or kiss him I get tinglys running through my whole body. I dunno what I feel for him or if i'm falling in love. I just know what we have is real and nothing or no one will come between us. 
Anyway, i'm gonna go be a loser and leave people comments on myspace now. Dont worry i'll prolly be back later runnin my fat mouth some more. 
Big lack of sleep is what it is. I'm goin nuts. But i'm still happy. So yay:)"

so today was not a success. i just wanted to sit and chill with people, sober. then everyone has to go and drink. of course i didn't cause i dont drive drunk. its the stupidest thing someone could possibly do. anyway so me and this girl went somewhere, i come back and jasons fricken on the bathroom floor saying he needs me. i dunno. we all fucked up tonight. i fucked up by leaving him by himself. and he fucked up by doing what he did. everything was just fucked tonight. i wish it wouldn't have happened. he told me not to let him do things like that anymore. we have so much fun together just chillen alone, but everyone always wants drugs and theres nothing i or anyone else can do about it. people dont enjoy their lives enough. right now i appreciate everything i have. theres nothing that i need to get fucked up over, so why do it. i can get a buzz when i'm sober just from being happy. everyone should be like that. being fucked up does not make life better, it just makes you sad because when you come back from it reality is back and aint that a bitch. theres no getting away from life. you just have to appreciate what you have every moment and try not to think about the bad things. 
i'm getting so upset. i'm gonna be up all night over this shit. i just dont know whats goin on over there and i'm worried about it."

Anyway heres a few things that have been happening-

Christmas- I had a good christmas.  Got a lot of things I wanted.  A lot of things that are awesome that I didn't ask for.  Surprisingly I took nothing back this year.  So yay! Success!

Car trouble- So after I was stupid and ran into a snow bank and almost killed Jason, I came home with a flat tire.  So I'm trying to pull around my dads van to put it in the garage and being the retard that I am, I ran into his van and knocked off my passenger side mirror.  I will never admit to it though.  My mom thinks someone else did it.  Then I woke up the next morning and my turn signal light will not go off and doesn't work in the front.  So I really dont know what happened with that but it pisses me off whatever it is.  I hate spending my money on stupid crap like that. 

Jason- I've been with him just about everyday this week.  I wont be all weird and tell you about our experiences.  Cause either you dont care or you dont understand.  But just to let u know hes wonderful and is coming to get me soon :)

Anyway so thats what I do.  Call me if you'd like to hang out cause I should prolly hang out with some people other than my 3 people that I see everyday.  So ok bye guys"

6th hr: Talk to Jay on the phone(awww hes so cute) and sit here doing this

haha. wow. Then after school i'm going home to do the exact same thing. Sit there. 
Oh yeah, I hate when people are at lunch and they assume things about me. 
One thing: I am not a fucking liar so dont look at me like i'm bullshitting because I will not lie to make myself look better. If I got kicked out of premeire for a different reason i'd say hey I was doing some shit and I got kicked out. 
Next, dont tell me when my pupils are fucking big or assume i'm on something because any drug that makes you pupils big I would not be doing at school or on a regular basis so people need to stop pissing me off and just shut their fucking mouths cause they dont know me or anything about me except that maybe i'm a little bit different then them.

We havent been ""together"" for long, but i'm already falling in love with him.  I've never been with a guy that didn't make me sad before but with him i'm always happy.  And he feels the same way.  I just wish I didn't have to lie to my parents about it.  Its gonna be hard to be with him without them knowing.  Its so worth it though.

I have a lot to say tonight.  Who knows why.  I just feel like talking cause I have no one to talk to.  Yes I know its sad.  Anyway, so today was fun.  I hung out with Dave, Justin, Deanna, Angel and someone else I forgot her name but it was pretty sweet.  We went to premeire for a few hours.  Gross Ryan Hood was there.  Hes all like I sniff a lot of coke.  And i'm like wow I dont care get away from me.  He was going to give us high fives and we totally didn't give him one.  Then Fat Boy called me.  He was all like hey u know anyone who wants piercings? and I was like yeah I do but I can get it for cheaper so I was like no.  But then old fart man decided to kick out everyone without a wristband on so we went over there and I got my nose pierced.  Surprisingly it didn't hurt one bit.  I also made a deal to get it for cheaper so it was 25.  Fricken awesome.  Its blue though cause thats all he had left.  Now I will have to wear blue all the time.  
So anyway when we were done we went to meijer and walked around.  People thought we were going to steal something and followed us everywhere.  I swear people are such teenage haters these days.  So we left there and went back to premeire like ass holes and went in the back so they wouldn't see us.  Then it was boring so we went back to Justins.  Then I went home.  Mommy still hasn't noticed the piercing yet.  Haha she will notice in the morning though.  I'm somewhat nervous.  oh well though its not like she can make me take it out.  
So umm Sam is being somewhat distant.  I'm not sure why.  Well he told me why, but I think that theres a lot more to it then that.  I wish he could just tell me ya know?  If he doesn't wanna see each other anymore then tell me.  Its not going to be any worse than this is right now not knowing.  So yeah i'm kind of upset about that.  I dunno why guys always like to fuck me over but whatever i'll deal with it and move on I guess if I have to.  
I'm talking to Megan right now.  It is fun cause I havent talked to her in a long time.  We are staying up with each other tonight cause of reasons you dont need to know.   HAHA
Anyway i'm going to keep blabbering cause i'm lonely and bored. ""Hello lonely, how you doin today? Hello sweet thing.  Why dont you walk this way?"" YEAAHHHH buddy.  
So I made this thing at school today and it was words for Ms. Yaek to the alphabet.  Cause she the biggest bitch ever... If you have newspaper with her you know why.  Wanna hear it? Well too fucking bad.

"event","Hello.  Remember how I said I was going to be stupid like I used to be?  Well if not look below.  Anyway I got a nice start on that last night and it was fricken amazing.  
I played cards for like 4 hours last night.  It made me very happy for some reason.  First I lost all my money.  Then I gained it all back then plus like $7.50.  Gambling is sweet.  I could do it all day.  Cause i'm that guy with that deal. haha no one gets that but me but whenever I see it i'll laugh my ass off so its ok.  I laughed about it for like 2 hours last night.  hahah i'm laughing right now.  My parents think i'm so weird when I start laughing when i'm sitting here. 
Anyway school two days this week! woo! Tomorrow i'm hangin with Shawn, then Tuesday who knows, then wednesday and thursday is work, then Friday hopefully will be DRITAN!!  Hopefully one of those days is piercings too.  Anyone wanna come with?  
ok bye i'm showering now"

Ok so I realized today that I am scared of guys.  All they are out for is sex. End of story.  I mean, not that girls dont want it, but geez at least we dont make it so obvious.  Sex is bad for you.  Never again till I get married.  Or find someone who it will be worth it.

I dont know why i'm telling you this......"

"event","So I dunno what is wrong with me.  I cannot figure it out.  I could sit here and cry about random things for prolly days right now.  But why?  Its not pms, no one has been mean to me or anything.  Everything is fine in my life right now.  In fact its better than fine... at least it should be.  See, normally i'd sit here and list everything that sucks about my life, but there is nothing!  Still I am not happy.  What can it possibly take to make me happy?  Well I dont think it would be possible unless I lived in fantasy world.  
Depression is horrible.  It makes me do stupid things and hurt people that I dont mean to hurt.  I seriously just want to die right now.  But I still do not know why.  I cant even show people that there is something wrong with me,  I act like everything is fine then I come home and cry for hours until I have to leave or until someone gets home.  Sometimes I just wish I was someone else.  I think maybe if I had a lot of money i'd be happy.  They say money doesn't buy happyness, but it would buy me a lot of clothes and stuff I dont need, and well, those things make me happy.  
I cant even eat.  I know I wished for this for I dont even know how long.  But I just want it to stop.  I'd rather be 1000 pounds and happy, rather than 130 and depressed."

"event","So i've been having good days, but they turn out bad because I dont appreciate them.  I was watching this commercial today and it told me to go to this website and check my symptoms of depression.  I have quite a lot of them.  Hopefully its only temporary like it usually is.  
Anyway, today was sweet I guess.  Someone died on my soap opera.  Its ok though cause I was expecting it.  So I didn't cry.... lol.  Ok well maybe a little.  Yeah then I went to Sam's and we hung out.  First he was making popcorn and lit a towel on fire by putting it on the burner.  heh.  Then we listened to Dave Cook er w/e he is called and fell asleep.  We finally got up and it was like time for me to leave.  But first ass hole eugene had to call me and insult me about my life and embarass me so I started crying.  Yes, horrible, but w/e.  I thought we he got out we'd be closer then ever, but things change I guess.... and people change.  And he changed for the worse. 
Yeah so yesterday was cool except for my extreme tiredness.  I got home from school and Shawn called me to go to his friend Ray's so after my guitar lesson I went over there for a while.  It was sweet.  Shawn got upset with me because well... only Lauren knows why and no one else really needs to know, but yeah.  I feel upset about it, but I guess like I said, things change.  Whatever happens will happen.  Hopefully whatever happens will happen to my benefit.  
But anyway guys, if i'm mean to you, i'm sorry, my excuse is that i'm depressed.  Try talking to me in a few weeks. haha."

"event","This was my sweet weekend:
Saturday- I went to gibralter cause my mommy took me cause shes sweet like that.  Then later I went to Tony's until like 9, then Dave called me and invited me to his new house.  I went over there since I havent seen him in like decades.  Hes so much fun.  I miss when we used to hang out like everyday.  
Sunday- K so today was really sweet except for the parts that got all messed up.  So this morning I thought I didn't work till 12 or 1230 so I woke up at 1030 but really I started at 1130 so I had to haul ass.  I ended up showering, drying my hair and getting ready in like 40 mins.  Then I go to find pants and I see that my cat has peed all over them.  Fuck cats.  Its going to dissapear.  So I ended up being late.
So I went to work, got out, Sam called and hes like omg Chris's van overheated so I cant drive out there.  So I went out there to get him and he gave me gas money.  My mom has wanted to meet him so he came over here for a few hours.  Then later we went back there.  I got pulled over on the way there.  It was so scary.  The cop left me with just a warning.  So I am one lucky bastard.  So yup then we got to his house and Andrew called me.  I gave the phone to Sam and andrews like I can see ur busy and I was like why do you think you have any business calling me anyway? and he hung up like the pussy he is.  I cant believe I ever saw anything in that kid.  I dont think I actually did, I think I kind of just used him until I found better. lol. 
Well anyway I got chimichongas to make and hw to do so bye guys."

"event","Welp, I just got home from Tonys and i'm pretty hungry.  I cant believe i've continued this diet for like a whole day.  
Today sucks.  This weekend will prolly suck.  Since my parents sold my game tickets, Sam is now going to western.  I told him I wasn't mad, but I am.  Hes like I wont cheat on you, but isn't that what people go to those places for?  Who knows though.  I need to learn to have more trust in people because I have none anymore.  People have betrayed my trust so many times that it is just so hard to give complete trust to someone who I think will probably just fuck it up in the long run.  Cause thats what happens to me.  Not sure why, but whatever.  Maybe I am a terrible person and just dont realize it yet.  But anyway, he says hes going to drive out here Sunday and make it up to me, which will be nice.  He wont tell me what hes going to do but he says it will be good.  I really wish I could have been with him tonight though.  
If anyone wants to ride to trivium at harpos tomorrow with me that would be sweet to gget loads of people so call"

"event","So today sucks.  I wish I could just go to bed until tomorrow.  Being awake right now seems so pointless.  
This will probably not make sense but I am just going to complain to the maximum now...... k so I was at school today and well it sucked cause I was at school.  Then I came home and my soap opera pissed me off cause I dont know who is going to die and I really hope its not Alexis cause that would make me really sad. :( But then I dont want anyone else to die either.  It will prolly be Reese.  She keeps coughing up blood.  
I need a cigarette, but I quit.  Who knows why.  Oh yeah Sam's inspiration.
I'm beginning to think that maybe boys are just really bad for me.  Maybe I should not have them in my life.  All they make me do is be crabby.  If I stop talking to him though he will be upset.  Actually I dont know because I dont know what he does.  Blah.  Really who cares.  I have no money, which means that I have no new clothes which means whoa! I am pissed the fuck off.
So umm today it feels somewhat as if i'm pmsing but that is not possible because that does not happen for like 8 more weeks.  What is wrong with me!!!!!???  I am so pissed.  I think its cause I quit smoking.  Maybe I will just have one.  Or 48395.  That sounds like a nice number.  No one will have to know about it.  Oh wait I have no fucking money.  Now what the hell am I suppose to do.  I think i'll take some caffiene pills and see what happens.  Maybe i will have a seizure and go to the hospital if I take too many.  At least I will be able to say that I did something worthwhile today.  My teeth hurt.  What the hell I was going to brush them like 2 hours ago but I forgot so i'm going to do it right now i'll be back in on second....
BRUSHING......
So as I was brushing my teeth, I was thinking ""hey, there is probably nothing to even worry about,"" Then I was like yes there is.  Then I couldn't decide.  Now i'm not sure.  My mind is kind of dead.  Lets think on the bright side of things:
GOOD THINGS
1. at least i'm pretty
2. eugene is back in 2 days
3. i can pretty much do whatever i want whenever i want
4. i have someone who likes me
5. i probably have a better life than most people
6. if i desperately need a cigarette, I can get one...
7. at least i'm not in trouble with the cops right?
8. i'm losing weight
9. my hair is sweet
10. I have a best friend who is sweet right turchi?

ok there is nothing else. i'm not about to list the bad things cause it will make me crabby again.  I kind of already listed them except theres like 29384723984729384729384729834723 more.  I will list a few though.  I have to work.  I work outside.  Its cold outside.  That sucks.  I hope kims working today, or someone sweet..... ok bye"

"event","Hello.
Today was fun.  I didn't feel good so I went to second hour then I came home.  So I slept until like 230 and woke up crying from bad dreams.  Man o man.  Then I watched my soap operas and started crying again.  So I was like what the hell is wrong?  I'm not suppose to have emotions like this.  Then I was like wait.... and I so forgot to take my medicine! So I took it and felt happy again.  Then Matt called me and I went and sat with him at his mom's campaign for city council and he handed out flyers.  Then I went to go see Sam.  He was depressed today but I think I made him feel a little better... at least I hope so.  We just hung out and stuff, talked, got pizza, went to meijer.  Ya know.  I just hope i'm not falling for someone who will fuck me over again because i'm really sick of it.  From some of the things he said today though, it really seems like hes not going to.  
So anyway, this coming up rest of the week is going to be shit.  I have work everyday, then saturday I have a Michigan game to go to.  Sam will prolly come with me if he doesn't go to this concert thing.  I hope he comes.  
More good news, I can finally listen to the ""girls girls girls"" song without crying.  I haven't tried listening to ""hit me with your best shot"" yet, but I think that one will be all good too. 
Welp i'm goin back to bed now.  Maybe yall will see me at school tomorrow if I decide to go.  Turchi if I go I will most likely have lunch with you so oh yeah."

"event","So today was frustrating.  First I went to school.  I was happy until I started to feel nautious.  Then I came home and it got worse.  I had my guitar lesson at 330 so I had to rush there feeling how I was feeling.  I started to get really hot and my guitar teacher was talking, but it was so hard to concentrate on the things he said cause I felt so dizzy.  Good thing I still played well.  
Anyway so then I went and walked around Mt. Clemens to take pictures.  It was fun I think I got some good ones.  Then I went to the mall and I felt like I was going to pass out so I went and sat in my car and took a nap before school started.  So I woke up and went to school.  My heart started beating really fast like I was dying or something so I just like layed there the whole time like a retard.  My teacher lost my paper. haha.  That means I get to redo it and get a better grade.  
So after college Sam called me.  He totaled his truck so i'm not sure if I will get to see him.  If all else fails though I guess I will just have to drive out there cause he was suppose to come here.  That sucks so bad.
Then I went to see one of my favorite people.  6 more days.  
alright i'm going to do something else now bye
Maybe I will see yall at school tomorrow unless i'm ""too sick"" haha.  Get down with the sickness! Yeah buddy"

All people seem to want to do to me this weekend is piss me off though.  They are all like hey lets piss Lindsey off for fun.  It doesn't bother me too much though cause I have a lot of friends and well most of them dont piss me off.  
Yeah so umm today I went to the DIA for my college class and took some pictures.  I didn't really expect the place to be so small but u know, whatever works.  Then I went to the clem and took pictures of sculptures.  Then Sam called me and he is cute.  So that made me happy.  Umm yeah now I just got back from walking around town taking more pictures from my night shoot.  It has just been a camera filled day today.
Another interesting thing is that I decided to grow some balls and call up Nick Hauler last night cause even though I know nothing will ever happen with us, he was an awesome friend to me all summer and well, I miss him.  He actually answered his phone this time and we talked and stuff.  It was cool.  I'm glad hes not mad at me anymore.
I ate old sour cream today.  I hope I dont get sick.  Actually that would be really sweet cause I wouldn't have to go to school. woo"

Then I went to port huron to take pictures and it started raining on me.  Then I went to Tony's and we watched Saw 2 and it was pretty sweet.  I will admit I was scared.  So now i'm very tired and feel like going to bed.  Ryan wanted me to come to Wayne's but i'm too tired so i'm going to sit here and eat my hot pockets and chill like a villan you feel? haha wow that was awesome.  There was something else I wanted to say but I forgot so maybe i'll write it later.  But I will say that I am a sucker for David Bowie."

"event","Hi everyone.  As you can see in the comments shit went down. heh. I'm not too worried about it though. 8 more days and I get my best friend back.  Hes going to be mad that i'm seeing someone.  According to him no one is good enough for me.  Nick wasnt.. he was always like what a pussy all he can do is kiss you after liking you for 3 months.  Hes like if I spent the night with someone almost everynight thats not what would be happening or I would at least kiss them.  haha.  Aww I miss him.  
So anyway, yesterday was awesome though as I said.  Me and Sam went to meijer and bought shrimp and socks, then we went to his new apartment spot.  He ate shrimp, we hung out... uh..., then we took a nap.  Then I had to wake up and leave.  Hes like noo I will miss you and it was so cute.  Hes like your going to hang out with some other guy and leaving me here.  Aww :(  
So yeah anyways, I got this new satellite dish and now I also have good channels in my basement so I can watch Degrassi all night every night. woo! And thats exactly what i'm going to do.  Its pissing me off though how everyone likes each other all the time.  Why cant someone do something different.  Have someone eat mushrooms or something.  Or have someone kill themselves already.  I've been waiting for like ever."

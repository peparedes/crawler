The moments I am in pain are the worse. The moments I'm not? Kinda like knowing you'll get your jaw smashed with a tire iron. Just waiting for the bones to break. It's hard to function like this. With such horrible pain. But, I have to. Still got dues, and bills, to pay. At least I got a good girl who actually cares. I hate doing one of these cliche posts, but it is what it is.

"event","So, an acquaintance from work told me about a band playing at a person's house on Park St. tonight. He is a Freshman and since I like the same kind of music he did, decided to invited me. The people that were playing were from Portland, Org. When I got to the house, the guy coalesced into one guy with a huge beard and long hair. Long of the short, he was pretty good. Kinda Devendra Barnhart, but not bad at all. He got up with a boxy guitar and sang songs about the earth and bars and women and howling at the moon with a very high and soulful voice. He was going around the country taking the money when it came to him. I ran into several people I knew there, mixed among the hipsters and girls in plaid. When did plaid make a comeback? One girl got up and was dancing while most people were sitting in the living room listening to the band. He handed the guy playing a High Life Lite. Weird. I wish I could have had some of her Apple Cinnamon Everclear, but whatever. It was a good night. Riding my bike home in the cool lighted streets was a plus, too."

I'd walked past Bowling Green Towers before. When I was in college, I'd seen them on walks to my friend's house. But I never really gave the place much thought until I spoke to a woman I worked with the other day. She was saying that she thought she would end up in the towers someday. It's a retirement apartment complex, but to me, it looks like storage for the soon-to-be dead. I can see men and women, alone in tiny rooms, waiting for the end. Not seeing anyone, not hearing from anyone, until the end. I know I won't go like that. I'd rather die young than rot inside my own body. If I live to be old, I'd rather they do me primitively and send me into the wilderness to be eaten by wolves. At least I'd have sky above me."

Neither of these are bad scenarios, but once in a while, change is good. (c) is actually looking for a job, but that's kind of a 24-7 type thing, dig? We went to a hookah bar that just opened in town, because I guess I need lung cancer sooner than later. I kid, but not really. What surprised me about this place was that it could actually be seen from the street, but had no other signage, making it virtually invisible to the majority of Bowling Green citizens. My friend told me word-of-mouth was Aladdin's Lamp's advertising of choice. I can't remember if I'd ever smoked a hookah before, but the set-up seemed familiar. A device, looking much like a tall lamp with no shade, was placed in front of us, with one spindly arm snaking out a clear plastic cobra's cowl. Atop the hookah was a piece of tin foil perforated. A coal, red hot and round, was placed atop. Now, I'm not much of a smoker, but seeing as how I may have done this before, I gave it a try. Our flavor, as these things seem to have, was orange, but more like an orange peel, which is not as bad as it sounds. We smoked and drank hot green tea poured from a steel teapot into styrofoam cups. The rest of the bar was much like that, humidifiers humming, vents sealed shut with black masking tape, white Christmas lights spiraling like mountain passes around quiet florescent rods, couches, chairs and conversation. Exhaling smoke seems to let you see more than you normally would, sometimes. We talked about the military, concentration camps and caving. Sometime through the middle of orange, my lungs began to hurt, so I walked outside for some hair. The street was cold, biting into my skin, and empty. I went back inside and soon tried the coffee flavor, which was my limit for the night. So much for pink pearly lungs. It was nice to leave my job search behind for a little while, knowing that once the sword is drawn, it has no option but to taste blood. That made no sense.

This is my way of announcing to the one and a half people who read this that I'm back in Bowling Green. You're welcome. Two years ago, before I graduated, I would have enjoyed the job I have right now. Work two weeks, get some twenties in your pocket, money for the bar or for having a few with my friends at their house. I'd be having a good time right about now, not standing for eight hours at a time working for minimum, sweating myself to the point of straining something trying to find a decent job. God, I'd give a lot to go back to that place right now, when being an adult didn't matter as much. This town, this college looks so different when you're sitting on a bench waiting for the bus to come by and take you home. Didn't have a Bowling Green bus back in my day. No PFT Food Court. No Health Center. I used to shuffle my ass up the hill from University Boulevard at eight in the fucking morning every weekday so I could work my ass off at the Herald and then those motherfuckers built themselves a new building at the bottom of the hill! In the past few years, I've been kicked out of two houses, lost my car, owned more money than I made and haven't even left the South. I swear to god, if it wasn't for my friends and my girl, I'd probably jump in front of fucking traffic. I'm going to have a drink now."

"event","I am constantly amazed and awed by how much Murphy's Law rules me life. I haven't always sung the high praises of cause and mass effect. Example: During a summer break from college several years ago, I decided I was going to visit a friend of mine in Versailles, a suburb of Lexington. I'd never been there before, and I didn't have a lot of money, so I decided to take Greyhound. So I went online, bought the tickets, which were non-refundable, and contacted my friend to arrange a time to pick me up and what we would do while I was there. Lo and behold, circumstances that were way beyond our control caused me to miss that trip. Now, I'm out of the hard earned $100 I paid for the ticket, money that came from slicing onions and cleaning grease traps at the local Hardees, so I was more than likely depressed by the situation. I did not have the appreciation I do now for how misery can be beautiful, but, then again, I had not suffered then the way I have now. Which brings us to today. I'm not all that sure I'm going to be seeing my family for Thanksgiving. My brother has lost his car to a blown radiator and won't be going and as he was my ride the three hours upstate to see the folks, I now have to find alternate transportation. Keep in mind that I don't actually want to go up there. My family will surely make my life a living hell one way or another. I'd rather eat broken glass and be beated with a crowbar than go up there. But the only thing worse than seeing your relatives at the holidays is doing nothing during them. So now I have to scrounge and cajole and barter just to go. Considering everything I've been through in the past few years, I can only sit back and marvel at the horrible mess of it. It's kind of like seeing a car accident inside an art gallery: you can only appreciate it in the right context. The possibility that I'll be out of a home in the next couple of months is way too close to view objectively.

"event","I could say I'm not much for it, but that's not the case. Exactly. Since the dawn of time, which for me occurred about 1985, mankind has dealt with his aggression in a violent manner. Locally, on the dodgeball court, globally, on the battlefield. Only the weapons are different for each arena. Most of the time I hate competition. I mean, I get flashbacks just seeing kids pick up the rough rubber balls in Wal-Mart. I think the only game I ever one in school was four-square when I was in the middle. I started talking trash after the game and Daniel Gardner, the quarterback, almost beat my ass. So, humility: always near. But the real reason I have loathed competition in the past is because I've been trying to play in the wrong sport. I'm not designed to be physically strong, fast, agile. I don't have a lot of stamina and I'll never have washboard abs. What I do have is a fairly decent mind. I'm never going to be a member of MENSA, but at least I know what MENSA is. So, when I actually want to enter a competition, you'd know I think I have a shot at winning. Making a short story even longer, I'm entering a short story into the Mississippi Review's story and poetry competition. Winners get published in the bi-annual magazine, along with $1,000. The thing is open to the entire country, so I probably don't have a chance in hell. But. It's a chance to get my hands taped up again. Get some words of wisdom from my wizened trainer. Slap gloves with the other guy before coming out of the corner swinging. That went on too long, but you get the point. It's more important for me to try and fail than to not try. That and I might get some comments about my story from the editors.

I don't think a person's truly lived until they've taken THAT walk. The trip was both planned and unplanned. There was talk of going at first, then someone decided that the casino was Shangra-fuckin'-la and I ran out of cash. So there we were, driving down 90 going past Long Beach, Waveland, Pass Christian (pronounced pass CHRISTIE ANNE). Then the question was posed to me. I think, I said yes because I thought it sounded like a dare. So with gas in the tank and the clothes on our backs, we made our way down there. Storm clouds were on the horizon. I got the nervousness. If this were Bat Country, I would have been worried. Getting to New Orleans wasn't a problem. Finding a decent place to park was. ""Decent"" meaning free. We got lost, as so many tourists do. Had to go back around and try it again. We parked in front of some power & utility building on Canal and walked what felt like four miles to Bourbon. The neighborhood got progressively worse the closer we got Bourbon, although we saw the most daring piece of graffiti along the top of a fourteen story abandoned building. But how to describe that street. I could say things like 'a Mecca to debauchery' or 'a hustler's Heaven and Hell' or 'where my heart will always lie' but that's all general stuff. If you try to cite specific examples, however, you lose the big picture all together. Saying that there's strip clubs on one end and gay bars on another doesn't work. Saying that there's a frozen daiquiri and/or Hand Grenade place every 20 feet isn't entirely true. Come to think, it probably is. I think the easiest way of explaining Bourbon Street to the uninitiated is that your first time there can be overwhelming. Travis was more quiet than usual. He was quiet in Jackson Square. He was quiet on the Mississippi. He was quiet on the way back through Bourbon and back to Canal, where we waited for the trolley. I supposed he was taking it all in, and that does take a while. This was my third trip to the Big Easy and I still haven't seen my fill. And, I supposed, that is the point. I got blisters for walking around, but I spent all of $3.25 and had a good time. And I'd never ridden a trolley before. So, check that off the list.

My family is too broke, people don't know about it, etc. I'd get upset about it, but it's really just another year getting older, so a celebration  doesn't really matter. This year's been a little different. My co-workers have a get-together with the other library in my town once a month. At last month's thing, my birthday was mentioned. They probably found out because I'm taking the day off work. I'd rather spend most of the day sulking anyway and it's easier to do at home. But, to give the folk a reason to schmooze and go out, they're using my birthday. Which sounded like an okay idea at the time. Get a little good food, maybe a card with some cash in it, okay. But now I have to go to this thing. And wouldn't you know it, the enormity of the birthday hit me. I'll be 25. I've been on this planet a quarter of my possible time. I'm too young to spend much time looking back, but if I think about everything that I've ever done, everything I've done to other people and what they've done to me, it's a hell of a lot. Kinda makes you want to sit in front of a fireplace in a tall-backed leather chair with a good sippin' bourbon and contemplate. Seeing as how I have none of those things, I guess I'll be frog-marched to the restaurant, try not to kill anyone when the staff starts to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to me, go home late at night, have a beer and enjoy the fact that I won't have to go through this again until next year.

But there's nothing I love more than bending a rule, so I'm going to write about something I have no clue about: fashion. Proof of the obvious: I was walking the dog yesterday when I started thinking about where I got the items of clothing I was wearing. I bought the white Nike running shoes so I could go running. I bought the grey t-shirt with the Viking logo on the front when I was covering a local rivalry football game in South Carolina. I bought the underdog team's shirt. And I bought the khaki shorts because I already own a pair of dark shorts. Add those with the Metallica hat I was wearing earlier and what do you get? A frat pledge? A 30-year-old dad who thinks he's still cool? As someone else once said, What happened to you, man? I've never dressed like I knew what I was doing, but I never was so appalled at my tendency to blend in with the cultural background as I was the other day. I guess I'm more interested in standing out intellectually than I am fashionwise.

Granted, the conference was in Kansas City, officially the most boring city I've ever been in, and I had to work as the features editor for the school newspaper for an entire semester, but whatever. It was a good chance to hang out in a new place, get free swag and do a little networking for internships. I signed up to get an interview with the Associated Press' recruiter. Just before going downstairs to the interview, I figure out the shirt I bought for the interview didn't fit me. So I switch to something else. Before the interview's really started, the recruiter, who I considered a very intelligent and likeable person, asked me why I wasn't dressed more professionally for the interview. For the record, I was wearing a polo shirt with khaki's, so it wasn't like I wore a t-shirt and jeans. But the recruiter had a problem with it. Specifically, he asked if I thought that I was dressed professionally enough. In a moment of rare courage, I told him I thought I was. Needless to say, I didn't end up interning with the AP that summer. It was literally a sign of things to come. Eventually, I would be hired by a newspaper that would require me to wear a tie four days out of the week. When I was let go from that job, I did my best to lose every tie I ever owned, save one that I wore to church on occasion. That's my policy now: don't trust anyone in a tie. Really.

The smell of baked-in grease, milkshake mix and sweat drifted off of me and out into the night that had become as cool as a bottle of beer at the bottom of a bucket of ice since I'd left my first job to go to my second. I could have asked for a ride home, but I didn't know the people I worked with well enough to bother with it. Jesus, it was my first night after all, and I don't like asking important questions if I don't know the answer to them already. I could try and thumb it, but I don't like being beaten, raped and/or tossed from a speeding vehicle into a ditch on the side of the highway. So, I took my beat-up Wal-Mart shoes, cracked and puckered with wear, and tried to wear off the grease epoxied to the soles by slapping them against the blacktop a few thousand times on my way home. Keep in mind, I hate walking alongside the highway. It brings to mind prostitutes, axe murderers, convicts or down-on your-luck types. Just because I have resembled the last recently doesn't mean I like being identified as such. So a walkin' I went. Out of all the times to take the highway, night time's the quietest. Doesn't mean it ain't dangerous. Especially when you walk with your back to oncoming traffic. There's at least one wooden cross with a name across it staked into the grass on my way home. I think about how fast it would be over if a drunk driver swerved onto the shoulder as I continue down the road. Several cars zoom by a minute, each close enough to feel the vibration of the engines. Across the four-lane is a institution of the local burger scene. Grandparents take their grand children there for a quick bite on stone tables underneath a converted overhang. In the dark, it looks like an old man sitting on his bed in the middle of the night, restless and aching for sleep that won't come. Next door is a brick house with a three-car garage next door. I wonder who lives there for half a second. Of course it's the owners of the burger joint. What, do you think they enjoy living next the rush of traffic 24 hours a day and the smell of diesel fumes? They could be living near the beach, if they wanted. But they want to be near their lively hood, their lives' work. Besides, only millionaires or condo developers to spend live near the beach after Katrina. Those with money to burn or money to make are the only ones to bother nowadays. I stop in halfway between home and work to give my legs a rest and buy a Gatorade. The lady at the counter is half asleep. On the way around a curve, I see a part of an old-fashioned lantern left on the side of the road, it's window's bleeding glass. I give it a good kick, because the sound of copper ringing is divine. And then, as I round the corner and trudge up the hill to the cottage, among the pomp and glamour of a sodium light parade, I smell incense, or wood burning in a fireplace. This is almost along the last milestone of the night road. The temperature is almost always low, but the energy is almost always high. I could be coming back from work, or a bar, or a friend's house, but it's always the same place. It could be Bowling Green, Ky., Gulfport, Ms. or Chicago, but it's all the night road. Life, I feel, is a million different moments from one state of being to the next. When I turn the corner, I know I'll have to write before I move from weary walker to resting dreamer.

Watched a documentary on crossword puzzles that wasn't too boring. Decided to walk to the truck stop. The day appeared so bright when I walked outside that it erased the meaning of darkness. The weather was warm, signaling the beginning of Mississippi's impossibly long summer. I surrendered to the heat and took on my hot weather uniform of shorts, t-shirt and scuffed, off-white Nikes with no socks. I don't remember much about the walk, other than the pool. A puddle of concrete and painted blue water framed by white iron. I absently noticed that the water was the same color as the sky when I saw something floating in it. A Mickey Mouse doll, about the size of a small child, bobbed face up on the glassy surface. Very 90s pop nihilism, I thought. I tried to take a picture with my camera phone, but the fence kept me from getting close enough for a good shot. Past the pool was more blacktop road and the backway into the truck stop. The hiss of a pressure washer serrated the morning air as I plodded down the short clay hill. Runoff pooled in places around dump trucks and big rigs facing the back of the truck stop. I maneuvered between the trucks to the front of the store. A riot of colored packaging and odorous noise had broken out inside. The former homestyle deli was being turned into a Subway and the product of those workings hung alien in my senses. With the little money I had, I bought a Sprite and the newspaper and went home. On the way back, I noticed a giant red inflatable castle rising above the old trailers and Katrina cottages. Someone had a good birthday. Later, I walked out to the porch to warm myself in the heat of the day. The trailer requires little in the way of air conditioning with its insulation, so I freeze when I'm not allowed to turn the air down. I sat down at the lip of the porch and got warmer. I worried a little about getting sunburned, so I leaned back and lied down on the porch with my feet in the sun. The white ceiling of the porch, which I'd never looked at before, had brown streaks and whorls like fingerprints here and there. I turned my face to the left. Tiny leaves shaped like kayaks were beached in the cracks of the blue slats of the porch. In the neighbors' yard, a little girl hung a jump rope around her neck like jewelery. Her afro puffs reminded me of Mickey in the pool, so I didn't think about that for long. Later, my mom called the ambulance. She was having trouble breathing again. ""You don't have to go with me this time,"" she said. I hadn't planned on going anyway. She knows she has to quit smoking. She came back in two hours, anyway. I walked the dirty clothes down to the laundry mat while she waited. I had two loads going when the sirens came closer. The ambulance service beat the fire department there by a few minutes. It was the other way around last time. I wandered back to the house about the time she was leaving. I waved to her through the glass window in the back of the ambulance. She waved back through her oxygen mask. They pulled away and I went inside to heat up some egg rolls in the stove. It would be a few minutes until the laundry was done."

What if I can't remember my name? How do I go about gathering the clues to finding my identity? Start calling people in the address book, of course! Part of the reason I keep pens in my pocket most of the time, other than being able to write everywhere, is to gather clues in case I lose my memory. You can really blame this phobia on the movie ""Memento.""

Understand that cliches weren't going through my mind when the side airbag in my mom's car exploded out of the dash and smashed into my face. Most airbags travel at 200 mph when they are fired. But how did an airbag end up catapulting into my face? It happens when the driver of the car turns into a road where a green light means yielding for other drivers. It's what happens when the driver of the car fails to notice the five other cars coming in the opposite direction. It's what happens when a car slams engine first into you at 50 mph. But you really don't realize the airbags have fired until the car comes to a stop and your face hurts. It takes your brain a few minutes to slog through the shock you're under to notice the deflated bags in front of you. Airbags inflate and deflate in the slivers of a second. They are fired with a small explosion which creates nitrogen gas which fills the bags. Most people don't know that an airbag in a 1995 Honda Civic smells like the inside of a latex glove and looks pink in color, even when a person's glasses have been hurled off their face by centrifugal motion. I think a person can be forgiven for sitting in the car for a few minutes shaking uncontrollably while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. I think people would also be surprised to find no blood on their faces, no broken bones, and no loss of limbs after an accident like that. Just a few bumps and bruises and soreness all over. I'm pretty sure that a person would be horrified to see the person in the other car attached to a back brace and a surgical collar tightened around their neck, and even more so when the driver of their car is done up the same way a few minutes later. And I'm fairly certain that after a clean bill of health by a paramedic and after the drivers gets out of the hospital, a person would be extremely hesitant to ride or even trust the person they were riding with during the accident again. Because this isn't the first time I've almost died in a car accident. I got hit by a truck when I was a kid and I could have died yesterday. So, not so much a fan of motor vehicles anymore.

It wasn't like I didn't know, not just in the back of my mind, but in the front, left, right, up, down, and around side. That the boiling glass pot in the kitchen filled with distilled liquid sin could be the end of me. But I couldn't stop myself. I took the cup and I drank from it greedily even as I realized the pain would soon begin. It didn't matter at that moment, but it would. God help me, there isn't enough coffee in the world to slake my thirst. 

Let me back up for a minute and explain. 

During my sophomore year of college, I went to the doctor after having some throbbing pain in what felt like my testicles. When I say throbbing pain, understand that I mean like being kicked in the sack over and over again. So, after waiting in the clinic for an hour worrying about cancer, the doctor told me I was going to have to have a prostate exam. 

The fun never stops in my life, if you don't know by now. 

What the doctor figured out was that the pain was caused by a swollen prostate gland, which became swollen due to prolonged caffeine use. This must have been bad, because the doc told me I couldn't have anything with caffeine in it ever again. 

So why am I drinking coffee in the present, when I know full damn well it's going to suck? 

Because I love caffeine. Oh GOD I love caffeine. Before going to the doctor, I drank tea, sodas and Red Bull. I even chewed caffeinated gum on occasion. Which explains why I have prostate problems. 

It's not like it's easy to avoid caffeinated products. Most sodas have caffeine in them. I have to go way out of my way to get clear sodas, non-caffeinated root beer and dark sodas. It sucks, but then again, so does
the pain. I can go weeks without drinking anything with caffeine in it and then I'll do something stupid, like have a Coke or a cup of coffee, and I pay for it. 

Because for a few seconds, caffeine is on the same level for me as orgasms and a really good book. 

Strangely enough, some days I want a cigarette as bad as a cup of coffee. Maybe addiction to both is related or something. 

So, if you ever see me sitting at a table in a diner with a cigarette in one hand and a cup of black coffee in the other, run, because someone has died or is about to.

And the people around here act like it. I only went to three parades over the past few weeks and that's only a third of the parades that go on preceding Fat Tuesday. I hadn't planned on going to so many, except that my brother's girlfriend is a parade fanatic and I got dragged along. There are realities to the parade that didn't occur to me, a Mardi Gras newbie, until I was deep into it. First, Mardi Gras does not necessarily mean naked women. Sure, the parades I went to around here did have drunk people, jailbait, drunk kids, old people, drunk old people, Scottish kilts, drunken college kids, ""grinding,"" face painting, drunk people falling in the street, drinking in public and drunks, but I wanted to see naked women, so I was heartbroken. Second, Mardi Gras beads hurt. Especially if you catch one in the head. The Krewes tend to chuck their wares at people as hard as they can, so ducking was essential. I saw a guy reaching down into his kid's walker get beaned upside the head with a plastic cup. There was an upside to the incident, in that iT was pretty damn funny. Watching out for other revelers is also important. I was stuck between a guy my own age and an old-timer during a parade, and while the young guy had longer arms, the old-timer tried to elbow me in the face like we were playing prison ball whenever I tried to go for a strand of beads. The throws were kind of fun, but nothing you'd really jump for outside of a parade. Besides thousands of miles of beads, there were aluminum doubloons, rubber chickens, moon pies, t-shirts, plastic snakes, plastic pipes, jester's staffs and more. As far as Mardi Gras traditions go, I only participated in the most well-known parts. I didn't go to any lavish Mardi Gras dances. I didn't eat any part of a King Cake, which is basically a giant doughnut covered in colored sugar, and even if I had found the plastic baby inside, I wouldn't have bought the next King Cake anyway, tradition or no. What did I really get out of my first Mardi Gras experience? A sunburn, a few free beers, the chance to see drunk people literally for miles on end and a few dozen strings of three-cent plastic jewelery. Laissez Les Bon Temps Rouler, everyone.

"event","Been reading ""An Arsonist's Guide to Writers' Homes in New England"" and I can tell it's a Big Idea novel because I think about the novel when I'm not reading it and I know I like it because I'm discussing it here, with you. What it, specifically, is making me think about is why people take such offense to the destruction of places other people consider ""sacred."" This isn't meant to be rant against religion, I'll say that up front. I'm just thinking out loud, and if you don't like what I have to say, no one is making you read. The protagonist in ""An Arsonist's Guide"" accidentally sets Emily Dickinson's house ablaze and gets sent to jail for a few years. When he gets out, he moves in with his folks, but immediately receives death threats about the house fire. I think, in this case, people have a right to be pissed off at this guy. He went to jail for arson, and no one wants a fire bug in their neighborhood. Two people also died in the fire, so that's even worse. But, in the book, the majority of people who rage at the protagonist are pissed off that he burned the house. Not at the loss of human life, not at the thought of a convicted arsonist on the loose, but because the house that a popular writer lived in when she was alive was destroyed. I don't understand that. I know it's a book, but people would get that upset about a real writer's house fire. I love Dickinson's poetry and consider it some of the most important work done in the history of poetry, but a house is a house. If a house is burned down and people lose their home, their sense of security, that's horrible and those involved deserve retribution. But a tourist attraction that was once a writer's house is nothing more than an old house that no one cooks dinner in, no one makes love in, no one watches TV in or takes a shower in. It is, in the sense that no one has any use it it as a house, is dead, and the people who walk through it and pay $5 a head to see where Emily Dickinson slept are touring a dead body. The destruction of a house has more impact as a message. The people in the book are angry because they think the protagonist hates Emily Dickinson. Emily Dickinson is dead. No one can hurt Emily Dickinson. In the same way that a house is just a house, a church is just a building where people come to feel closer to God. There's nothing intrinsically important about the Vatican in comparison to the little church down the street when it comes to its sacredness. The Vatican may be financially more important, but its ""holiness"" is only important to practicing Catholics and those who deem it to be holy. Hell, if a library burns down, and I hope that day never comes, I'd only be concerned about any loss of life and the damaged books. A library is just a place for letting people borrow books. A church is just a place where some feel closer to what I've heard described as the ""Sky Bully."" A house that a writer lived in is less than nothing if it's used as a memorial to that writer, and even less when it is gone.

I've stated previously that a writer should be able to get their point across in the story. What I really want to do is explain my own position on comic book universes or post-humanity or whatever label you want to slap on it. It's rather simplistic for someone who, admittedly, knows rather too much about comic books. When most people talk about comic books, they're always begin with a super-hero or super-villians abilities. I've played this game on long car rides. If you could have any power, what would it be? Flight? Invulnerability? Laser vision? It's not surprising most people think the Superman package of powers described above are the most desirable. Besides being the coolest set of abilities, Superman's symbol is one of the most identifiable in the world, second only to the cross. I'm not against this kind of daydreaming, except if it ever crossed over into the real world. If someone could actually do all the things that Superman does in our actual reality, assuming it were actually possible with our current technology, he would be a freak, a deformed nightmare with a reinforced nanotube skeleton for strength, resistant plastic muscles for durability, laser barrels for eyes and rocket boots for feet. He'd be treated as an abomination, and rightfully so. Someone with that kind of power could only end up using it for personal gain or lose control of it and devastate the planet. Because it takes a human mind to create empathy and this ""Superman"" would no longer resemble anything human. What does all this have to do with the previous story? You don't have to have fantastic abilities to be a danger to other people. Batman is one of the most popular characters in the comics and the movies. He has taken out Superman in the comics several times. In the comic world, he's a hero. If he were in our world, he'd be a lunatic vigilante who dresses up as a bat and breaks people's heads. The last part distresses me more than his other qualities. Violence is an inherent part of the superhero mythology. The bad guy gets punched in the face and taken to jail. In real life, the people involved would receive severe injuries, whether they were criminals or not. Imagine getting arms broken, heads caved-in, legs sliced off, lungs being liquefied. It's excruciating and horrifying. I've never been in a fight before, but I have been punched in the face. It is not a great feeling. Magnify that pain times a thousand. Because anyone that could swing from rooftop to rooftop on a monofiliment line could easily know interrogation techniques or have combat training or access to massive amounts of explosives. In truth, super-heroes would be no better than terrorists if they existed in our everyday lives. Which is probably why it is better that they don't.

Despite all the work I do in it, the helmet's material stays dry. Sometimes it helps to have government connections. The helmet's green optic lens bug out of the empty black ""face"" with the weight of the infrared technology inside. The lens' flash occasionally as the computer checks out the fiber optic connections, communications suite, psychic reinforcements. I take the waist-length black coat off, dust off the slick outer shell and start unloading the inner shell. There's about 50 different pockets inside the coat. Each has a use. I reach into each one and refill, reload or replace whatever is in it as needed. They include: first-aid kit, miniature defibrillator, tampons for stopping critical bleeding, rebreather, portable gas mask, $1,000 in used currency, $1,000 debit card, lockpick kit, extra gun, tear gas grenades, flash bangs, frag grenades, ant grenades, smoke bombs, chemical handwarmers, metal flask filled with vodka (for sterilization), flare gun, flares, chemical lights, flashlight, handcuffs, plastic wrist restraints, freezing spray, mace, plasma torch, mini digital camera, secure cell phone, sodium pentothal, snake venom, plastic bags, nylon cord, garrote wire, and ten knives in various lengths, widths and materials.

The nightstick electrocutes. Internally, if I feel like it. I unlatch the belt from around my waist, feeling lighter already.

"event","I stare at the window across the way for about ten minutes before I decide to go in. I shuffle my boots for a moment on the rooftop, kicking a little gravel off the side and onto 32nd Street, fifteen stories below. I look left and right, up and down. The others may forget that a threat can come from anywhere, but I never do. I do another 360 scan as the wind kicks up a little, trying to drive me off my perch. Before it succeeds, I reach under my coat, pull out the hook, and fire it at the nearest gargoyle preening from the corner of the building. As soon as it latches, I edge over the ledge, let gravity pull my body down, and kick hard off the side of the building. I swing left, holding tight to the hook's line, until I come around the side of the building. As soon as my feet slam into the brick side, I kick back as hard as I can, releasing the hook from the gargoyle. In the moment between the moment, my old DI used to say, anything is possible. Just because I sighted the window and did everything right up to this point doesn't mean everything isn't going to hell anyway. All I can do is stare at the sky and wait for it to happen. I make it into the window and roll across the floor as the hook reels in behind me, almost getting chopped off by the security gate. I crouch with the hook in one hand and a Decimator in the other, scanning the room. No one. The security system clicks four times and the lights come on. ""Dim,"" I say. After the soft focus haze of street lights from the rooftop, florescents feel like daybreak to my eyes. I reholster the Decimator and the hook and pull the carpet back into place with my boot. ""Open vault,"" I say into the empty room. ""Authorization: 1752419alphagammaniner. Password: Amelia."" The floor shakes and a piece of the wood floor snaps up and away. Underneath, the vault rolls up and opens, displaying helmet stands, hangers for work clothes, hook holders and racks and racks of guns and ammunition. Can never have too much of either. Time to take inventory."

"event","I'm pretty tired of the restaurants around my work. There are two po-boy restaurants, two burger joints, a pizza place, a horrid Chinese buffet and a Mexican place. I've eaten at each of these places long enough to get bored with them ten times over. I could just bring my lunch to work, but really, what joy would I have in my life if I did that? If I was disciplined enough, I would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every day for a year and use the money I saved to leave. Without it, I pick one place at random, unsatisfied with whatever I order. Today, it was one of the po-boy places. I ordered the special. Never order the special. Ordering the special signifies that you don't give a damn about what you want to eat and are giving the kitchen staff permission to serve you portions of unedible globs of lard covered in fly larve in a lake of three-day old cabbage water. The special was Spicy Crawfish Salad. It was salad and it was crawfish. The restaurant's idea of spice was to add jalepenos. Normally, I love 'em, but not on a salad with seafood. Come on. I got indigestion just thinking about it. Sometimes, I think it would be proper to show your displeasure with a meal by walking into the kitchen, finding the head cook and vomiting on them. Honestly, it would be the most fun I'd have all week.

"event","Welcome to the stage of history....2008 is here. I was already in the mood for a new 12 month period and then this showed up. Lucky me. Being ushered in with Aught Eight is a new column in this piece. I call it This Is How I Would Do This. I take something that most people don't give a lot of thought to, make it more complicated, and screw it up in royal fashion. Here we go. Today's topic is Selecting Songs from a Jukebox. There's a little pizza place that just opened near my work. It is supposed to offer New York-style pizza, but if this is what it is, then it isn't great. They also have a really nice jukebox. It's not a record-spinning red and gold giant of yesteryear, but it does have a touch screen and decent music. Besides Top 40 and Country, there's a few under-the-radar songs. Not entire albums, but some recognizable songs. When selecting songs in a public place, you have to consider who you might be pissing off with your selections. I live in Mississippi, so I didn't want to play Nine Inch Nail's ""Capital G,"" or something like it unless I was spoiling for a fight. Which, most of the time, I'm not. You can also forget me playing t.a.t.u. or some other pop crap. I'm not against good pop, just bad. So, what's left? Creedence Clearwater Revival? Not right now. Red Hot Chili Peppers? If I were in the mood. Really, I only wanted to hear one song roar across the pizzeria, and thank God they had it. From the first guitar riff: Bowwowchickachickabowwow to the slow dying of the drums at the end, I recommend The Toadies' ""Possum Kingdom"" as the greatest song ever to be put in a jukebox. I know every other song pales in comparison, but I wanted to hear more. Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out,"" Blur's ""Song 2"" and the Raconteurs' ""Level."" I would have gone with ""Steady As She Goes"" if they had had it. After my songs started playing, all was right with a world. There was a theme I was trying to stay with in my selections. Good songs that not everyone has heard with good energy and something the people behind the counter haven't heard 60 times that day. You have to take a lot into consideration when selecting songs from a jukebox. That's how I would do it.

"event","I'm pretty sure it's fatal. Or, at least, it could be. It's not like I should be doing other things. There are books to put away, book shelves to be read and corrected. But why? There's only been a handful of people in here today. Not enough to be busy all the time, but just enough to annoy. And I don't have telepathy. If you lay a library card down on the counter and look at me without saying a word, I don't automatically know you want to use the Internet. I can guess, because your inability to speak may also mean you don't know how to read and are confused as to why the Internet Plaze has so many books. Still, not a lot of people. I went and saw Juno last night. It was good. I'm so bored I'm reading old issues of Entertainment Weekly! It's not like I'm not usually bored here, but it's a bored pock-marked with social networking sites and online comic strips. None of those things are helping today. Perhaps I have reached my boredom threshold? This isolation from my friends is pretty freaking hard. I'm pretty sure I'd be more entertained living in Antartica. After all, you put folk in a plastic bubble during the coldest winter on the planet, add some booze and things start to happen.

"event","Of course, now is the big difference between trying to keep a city together during a natural disaster and an unnatural one: the banter. There's always some bit of shit-talking between sides, no matter if it is between two teams of superheros about to smash it out over a mistake or a lone hero about to get the drop on a mugger. The Pit goes quiet as we watch the two scream at each other silently. ""What's the girl's name again?"" Dave says. ""Sister Twister,"" I say. ""Jesus, what is with these guys' names?"" ""Comic books."" ""What?"" ""Comic books use up all the good names. Superman. Spider-man. So these guys have to use what isn't copyrighted."" Tin Can rages for a while, then Sister Twister puts a hand up. He gets blown into the Barrier along with old drink cups and newspapers. While he's down, the two guys he brought with him open up their machine guns at her. I don't think she's bullet-proof. A gust of wind makes her back flip into the air, spin like a fastball and come down with roundhouse kicks for the both of them. By then, Tin Can is running at her with his head down, trying to spear her on that ragged metal attached to his skull. She manages to move in the last second, missing being impaled but gets knocked across the street by the charge. A gasp goes up in the Pit. ""It ain't over yet,"" I say. Sure enough, she gets up, takes off the broken sunglasses, wipes the blood off her face with a gloved hand. She's tough. She throws a hand at Tin Can and the wind picks up to hurricane speed. He's having trouble standing, so he digs his hands into the pavement. That can't be all. It isn't. With her other hand, she calls up a wind underneath a parked glass company truck. Its tires leave the ground as the truck begins to rotate. It starts out slow, but goes and goes until it's nothing more than a blur. She flings it at him then and when it hits, he's knocked off the ground, into the air and collides with a Starbucks at freight train speed. ""Jo, tell Public Works the street at 8th and Vine is going to need repaving. Also, call 'Ted and Sons Glass' and let them know the city will pay to replace its truck."" ""What about Starbucks?"" ""What about them? They charge too much anyway."" A steel girder hurtles out of what's left of the coffee shop window and misses her by a centimeter. She's in the air again, flying this time, trying to stay out of the way of flying chairs, coffee urns, cappuccino machines and what looks like an industrial dish washing machine. She does her best to stay away from a sky now boiling with foreign objects, but doesn't seem to notice that she's drifting closer and closer to the ground, while Tin Can, now out from under the collapsed roof of the coffee shop, is getting within striking range. A power line snakes violently in front of Tin Can, which stops him for second. He looks down. And smiles. He reaches for a length of the live wire, pulls a 'No Parking' sign out of the sidewalk and wraps the line around it. He tosses it at her, slower than he normally does. She drifts out of its way easily, but doesn't see what he's doing. Tin Can suddenly yanks on the wire, making it reel in and slam into her back. Her body falls to the ground, which thankfully isn't far away. Her body convulses as thousands of volts go through her. ""Someone tell Municipals to turn off the power there now!"" Someone dials, but all I can see is Twister about to die. Smoke starts coming out of her costume. There's got to be something... ""Diode, are you still monitoring?"" I yell across the Pit. ""Yes, Samuel."" She almost sounds strained. ""Patch me through to Twister, now."" ""This isn't.."" ""No time! Do it!"" There's a burst of radio static, then a buzz that ends abruptly. The power's finally off. ""Twister. Twister, it's Sam. Wake up."" A weak whisper comes across my headset. ""Sam?"" ""Yeah. You remember me? I was the guy who did that thing with you that time? The Elephant Man?"" ""Oh, yeah. The Elephant Man."" The voice is a little stronger before. I know the shock took a lot out of her. I'm hoping her costume's at least a little insulated. ""Yeah. How ya doin'?"" I say. There's almost a laugh. I see over the monitor she's trying to get to her feet. ""I've been better."" She slips and falls back down to the ground. ""I think I'm about to die."" ""I don't want to hear that. I know you. You don't want to leave it like this."" ""He's too strong."" ""That doesn't make him invincible. I got one question for you, then you can lie down and get your head crushed like a wet gumball if you'd like. Is he metal all the way through?"" All I can hear is her breathing in and out for a few seconds. ""No."" She starts to crawl away from Tin Can, who's about a foot away, stalking her. ""Jo, get Municipals on the line, tell them to turn the power back on to the area as soon as I say."" He stands right above her now. I can only guess about the look on his face. He lifts a fist high over his head, ready to bring it down. In that moment, it could be all over. But it isn't. Twister grabs the power line and presses the exposed end to Tin Can's chest. ""Now."" Sparks begin to fly off of Tin Can's skin. His head shakes back in forth like he's having a seizure. She holds the wire to him for a minute, then throws it away. He falls backwards onto a station wagon, almost bending it in half. It's over. ""Jo, turn the power off."" There's a lot of clapping and cheering going on after that, but I walk back to my office and close the door. ""You okay?"" I say into the headset. ""I'm fine now,"" Twister says. ""Thanks for the tip."" The line goes quiet. I take a moment for myself in the quiet of the office before going back outside to deal with the real work. Power lines will have to be repaired. Roads will have to be blocked off during repairs, while detours are assigned. Traffic will be worse than usual. People will complain about being kept out of their offices for hours, and more than anything, the city. While most of the civilians are sleeping, work crews will spend the rest of the night cleaning up the broken glass and trashed appliances, until it looks like it did before. 10 hours of work for a ten minutes fight. And that's a good day. I get off work about seven, about to head home, when I see the new guy. He's sitting outside the building on a bench, staring out into the traffic. I've seen that look before. Mainly because I've had it before. I sit down on the bench near him. ""Rough day?"" He laughs, and it's not completely annoying. ""Like I said, everyday is not like this."" He shakes his head, and I know he doesn't believe me. ""Hell of a thing to see, however. Makes boxing seem pedestrian."" ""How did you do that? With the power line."" he says. ""I didn't do it. She did."" ""Whatever. How?"" I hadn't really thought about it until now. How had I done it four years ago? ""I don't really know. Sometimes you just...react."" ""There's got to be more than that."" There is, but I'll tell him later. ""Go home, Jacob. The real job begins tomorrow."" And I walk across the street."

"event","When he looked back on this life, it was like a movie, in that he always seemed to be walking away from the camera, up a street, across a street, down a street, adjacent to a street. He'd walked backwards through bank drive-thru lanes. He'd walked forward in a sudden cold snap wearing only t-shirt and jeans, almost running down the hill to his home, screaming every time the wind flipped his skin up like a tent flap and stone froze his insides. Walking had taken him places. He had gotten to walking the deserted rail beds in that town he didn't talk about anymore when he couldn't sleep or wanted to pretend he couldn't. They were strange ways of walking that cut across street after street, leading away from the relatively safe main drag to more foreboding poor areas, all the way to the current railroad tracks and fields of high grass. He had followed that track, had followed it as far as it went, past elementary schools, textile mills with deer grazing near a pond, golf courses with their waste of land, apartments, especially the one where she still lived, until it had reached the other highway. He had turned back then, turned back, but followed it the other way, until he realized he had been walking for hours and was far from his home. His legs ached when he finally made it back, but he felt he had accomplished something, which was something to cheer in his empty life. Wearing the right shoes was important to walking. He had once gone walking out to the other highway, stepping lively, happy to be out in the night air, away from the walls and the noise behind them. His feet began to be sore, then began to pang with pain. He was wearing a cheap pair of bowling shoes, for God's sakes, what did he expect? He had to sit down. He sat on a bench near a souvenir shop, resting his feet on the wood for a while, thinking he could make it to the pharmacy down the street. When he felt better, he hobbled down there and thought about buying a pair of shoe cushions, but didn't have the money, so he resolved to buy six pairs of socks instead. He put each of them on, one after the other, behind a closed bank, watching for police cars. Highways were too dangerous to walk, no matter which way you were going. He didn't think about them much. Walking was the only thing he knew that didn't require anything of him, except his legs, his lungs, his heart, things he always had. He believed, if he believed in anything, that he would walk the streets, back roads, alleyways and trails until his feet could no longer support his weight and he would make his home wherever that would be. It made sense to him, like the walking."

"event","""Samuel,"" says a voice over the speakers in the Pit, louder than they should be able to go. ""Diode?"" ""What has happened to Catapult? His locator beacon shut down three-point-four seconds ago."" ""Lower your volume. I think my ears are bleeding,"" I say. How is she doing that? ""I apologize."" ""Tin Can took out Catapult. He looks unconscious. What was the point of sending him here? You knew he couldn't take a Level 3!"" If robots could sigh, I think that's what Diode would have done, because she came back a second later sounding tired. ""He's been asking for weeks to be put into the rotation. Catapult thinks he's got something to prove. Eventually, I ran out of reasons to say no."" ""Perfect."" ""I'm calling in Sister Twister to recover Catapult and stop Tin Can."" ""No! Her powers could destroy half the city!"" ""There's no one else available, Samuel."" Christ. ""Timmy, call the police. Tell them we're initiating BattleBarriers within a three block radius of the bank in five minutes. Marsha, call Municipals and let them know we're in for high wind, rain and lightning immediately. Jo?"" ""Yes,"" she said, coming out of her office. ""Where have you been?"" ""Someone's got to make sure the Mayor doesn't fire you. I like my job, thank you."" ""Thanks for the help. Tell your Honor we're bringing BattleBarriers online to protect the city from Sister Twister's fight with Tin Can. Tell him I don't like it anymore than he does, but Tin Can will try to destroy the entire city just trying to leave town."" ""The barriers won't stop him from leaving if he wants it enough."" She's right. BattleBarriers were only designed to stand during a ten-minute brawl. If this thing goes into overtime, the barriers will fall and the damage and death toll will rise. ""If you have another solution, Jo, I'll do that, instead."" I start walking towards the BattleBarriers computers, when Dave comes towards me. ""You can't do this, Sam. You can't do this."" ""Dave..."" ""Those men out there are going to be blown apart if you let that bitch come here."" ""What do you want me to do, Dave? What do you want me to do?"" ""Let the blue do its job. Take him out."" ""Does the police have anything other than a tank that would even put a dent into Tin Can?"" Dave says nothing. There have been rumors that that the PD are working on some new super-cop, but if Dave knows, he hasn't told me. ""The men can't fall back to safety if the barrier is up."" ""They can if they leave now. Go tell them, Dave."" I get to the BattleBarrier computer. Hunter, its operator, is already sitting in front of it, mapping out its path on a grid map of the city with a stylus. Right now, sirens ring out across the city. Police are evacuating buildings near the bank. Channel Six and the Herald should have it by now, so at least the word's out. ""Marsha, what's Sister Twister's ETA?"" ""One minute, thirty seconds."" ""Hunter, activate the barrier the moment she enters the area."" Thankfully, there are no apartments or houses near the bank. Most times, we're not that lucky. The main monitor pans up from the bank to the sky, where blackish green clouds swirl. The storm seems to circle over the bank. ""Pan down back to the bank. I want to see Tin Can's reaction to this."" Need to know if he's going to run or not. We see him load the last bags and watch the van groan as he gets in the back. The van speeds down the street. ""Bring up the barrier,"" I say. It's almost like a wave, except that it appears everywhere at once. Bright yellow waves of energy erupt from traffic poles, street lights and the sides of buildings. The wave runs from one side of the street to the next, then the next, then the next, building as high as three stories. When it finally crests, the barrier looks solid. Which it is. ""Are we still following the van?"" I say. ""Yeah,"" Timmy says, clearing his throat. The main monitor switches to another skyscraper cam, this time a block or two away from the bank. The van's stopped sideways in the middle of the street, not far from the barrier. Tin Can bursts out of the van, screaming and clenching his fists. ""What's he saying?"" Timmy says. ""He's probably saying how he's going to kill us all,"" I say. A bolt of lightning suddenly strikes near Tin Can's feet. Timmy pans up and a funnel cloud extends towards the ground. When it gets about five feet from the ground, the storm coalesces into a five-foot-ten woman with brown hair tied in a ponytail. She's wearing black leather from head to toe and black bugeye sunglasses. She looks pissed."

It unfolds in fourteen different pieces like a flower, and grows a keyboard, large monitor, and two round vertical plates, cloudy green. I spin a few dials on the control panel, flip a switch, type a few commands into a keyboard in a language not spoken on Earth. Eventually, someone appears. It is an approximation of a female face, if someone was trying for perfection. Instead, it's too perfect, a porcelain face with no blemishes or outstanding marks. There are no pupils, either, just snow, like a TV on the fritz. There is hair made out of silver wire, pressed against a partially transparent head. ""Good morning, Diode,"" I say. ""Hello, Samuel,"" she-it-says. ""What is the situation?"" ""We've got a bank robbery in progress led by someone with armored skin. Uploading video now."" She looks off-screen. ""Identified as Kenny Hardin, A.K.A. Tin Can. Subject is known to possess Level 3 superhuman strength, along with Level 3 Durability. How may we assist you?"" The 'we' is the Super-Human Union, a group of unaffiliated powered heroes who respond to natural disasters, riots and terrorist attacks for a fee. Union fees run into the hundred thousand mark per month, but since the city was almost destroyed by the Emperor four years ago, it has become as necessary as police salaries. ""So, who's up in the schedule? Marksman? Ronin?"" I say. She-it-looks off to the side. ""Searching. I'm sorry, Samuel, but we only have one member in the area. The rest are helping clean up a new K'Nal invasion in Sydney."" Oh, good. ""Give me the bad news."" ""It is Catapult."" ""Nope. Try again."" ""I will try to have someone else available as soon as possible."" ""Fine."" I power down the computer and it folds itself shut. I turn around and the new guy's hovering nearby. ""Can I help you with something, Jacob?"" ""What was that?"" This guy is beginning to piss me off, and not just because he's too curious. ""That was Diode, the Union's Information Technology manager and communications officer. She's a half-hologram, half-silicon robot. Any other questions?"" Hell, the new guy looks like a kicked puppy, all downcast eyes. He goes back to his seat. ""Dave, call the police and tell them the Union is sending Catapult to the scene."" ""Well, shit, I thought they were going to send someone who didn't suck this time."" Dave doesn't have a good opinion of the Union, or of super humans in general. He's still looks like a cop, with his graying crewcut and mustache, but he had to leave the force after losing his leg rescuing a kid from a fire. ""We take what we can get, Dave."" ""Who's Catapult again?"" Timmy says, looking over the wall. ""Yellow and black uniform, helmet, flies, shoots those steel ball bearings from his gauntlets..."" I say. ""Oh, that guy is a loser."" ""Are they still loading money into the van at the bank?"" I say, trying to change the subject. ""Yeah. How far out is Catapult?"" ""Standard time for the Union is ten minutes."" I say. ""The Tenth Precinct is rolling out uniforms and SWAT now. Should have the scene rolled up in five minutes."" Timmy says. ""Advise them not to engage Tin Can until Catapult arrives. We do not want this guy pissed off."" Here's the real hard part of my job: waiting for something to happen. All we know now is that they haven't killed anyone yet. Probably more concerned with getting the money together before the cops show. I watch Tin Can load sacks of money into the van on the monitor and wait. The cops scream up to the bank in four minutes. Tin Can doesn't even look at them. ""Catapult within city limits."" Sara says. She's in charge of monitoring hero and villain activity in the city. ""Inbound to scene."" The same camera that was watching the bank pans up to watch Catapult fire his boot jets and lower himself to the street. He talks with the SWAT commander on the scene, then blasts inside on all thrusters. ""What the hell is he doing?"" I say. Catapult breaks through the front doors of the bank. The microphones in the bank pick up the fight. Something crashes to the floor loud enough to be a desk. One of the bank walls that faces the street cracks after someone is thrown against it. During all this, the sound of stone against steel and high-powered cannon fire is heard. Suddenly, it all stops. Something is hurled out of the front doors and buries itself in the pavement. ""Zoom in."" I say, already knowing what it is. A yellow helmet, broken into two pieces, lays near the still body of Catapult. ""We're gonna need that help sooner than later."" I say."

says 'Day Emergency Manager' underneath 'Samuel Arlington,' and its been months. I unlock the door, clear a pile of paperwork off my chair, clear another pile of paperwork from in front of my computer and check
the latest reports. Traffic snarl on the 1507 being cleared up. Another bank robbery on Portland Ave last night. Jo walks in. She's in a grey pant suit with black pumps. I wear jeans and tennis shoes most of the
time. We don't always get along, but she's the best second-in-command I've ever had. ""Hi, Jo."" ""Did you even shave this morning?"" It's always something about my appearance that irritates her. Yesterday it was my
jeans. ""No. Why, is the Mayor here?"" ""No, but you're supposed to set an example."" ""Jo, everyone else dresses worse than I do."" She frowns. ""Except for you, of course. Anything special this morning?"" ""Just what I sent you in the mail. Oh, and the new guy is here, a Jacob Henderson from Nowhere, Ohio."" Great. I wanted to spend the morning searching last night's video for a hint of the bank robbers whereabouts, but now I have to walk the newbie through the paces. ""Send him in, so we can get this over with."" A few minutes later, a gangly kid with curly red hair in a too-small suit and tie comes in. He looks uncomfortable in his own life. ""How are you doing today, sir?"" he says. ""There's no reason to kiss my ass this early in the day. My name's Sam."" We shake. ""What do you know about us?"" ""The Office of Emergency Management and Communications is mainly responsible for alerting city, state and federal agencies about any metahuman crisis, providing logistics support and searching for metahuman crime."" Did he just recite the recruitment brochure from memory? He's gonna be one of those, I can already tell. ""I'm glad you know the mission statement, Jacob, but its not all we do. Metahuman emergencies take up about 30 percent of our normal operations. The rest of the time, we help police, fire, military and public works do their jobs better. C'mon, I'll show you around."" We take a left out my door and walk into the Pit. Every time I come to work, I'm reminded how much it looks like Mission Control for a space shuttle launch mixed with a call center. People sit at rows of desks, working the computers and the phones, that lead up to the main monitors in the same space where the fire department once parked its trucks. ""This, Jacob, is where things happen. It's official designation is Strategic Command and Control. Most of us just call it the Pit. In the back of the room, we have six 'wings' of dispatchers, two each, each connected with police, fire, public works, who tell us where stuff is happening and we use that info to let them help each other. The two desks in front of them are Video and Cellular Surveillance. They are the senses through which the SCC sees and hears the city. They help us find the bad stuff, so we can deal with it. Timmy, I want the video from the bank robbery on my computer in an hour. The two large consoles near the Main Monitors house BattleBarriers and the Advanced Communication and Emergency System, or ACES,  computers. Now, the lunchroom is..."" ""BattleBarriers,"" the new kid says, almost reverently, as he walks towards the consoles, and I now know he's going to be one of those. He walks to the consoles and stretches his hands out. ""That's not a good idea,"" I say. ""Why?"" ""Because I'll get fired if something happens to them."" ""Oh, I thought they would come and do something."" I hate it when the new people call them ""they."" Just because you can fly and bullets bounce off you does not make you any different than anyone else. ""Let's focus on something important for the moment, like your OmniCom."" I pull the earpiece off and show it to him. ""Looks like your normal headset, right?"" I pull on the sides and a shimmering blue light erupts between the two slender pieces of silicon. ""The OmniCom also lets you access your work email account, along with the Internet and a few computer systems. It also keeps you in touch with SCC at all times. While you're only required to spend a few days a week on 24-hour call, it is always a possibility."" I looked around. ""So, I'd direct you to your desk, but I don't know what you're doing. What did you apply for?"" ""Uh, my ID says 'Seeker'."" Seeker? ""You have a Master's in IT or something?"" ""No,"" he says, almost sheepishly, ""I have a PhD in Internet information discovery and research."" Aw, come on. ""You're the new Internet sleuth the FBI's been promising me for months?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""It's still Sam. Your desk's over here."" I thought this guy would at least be a seasoned hayseed, not a newb with no experience. Give him a chance, Sam. Fine. I lead him over to a bank of computers off to the side of the Main Monitor. ""This is yours."" He sits down in the desk chair, adjusts the height to his liking. ""Take a few hours to set up the system to your specs. Call me on your Omni if you need anything changed on the admin level. Ask for 'Sam.'"" I'm about to leave, when he stares out at the Main Monitor like he's waiting for something. ""Fights don't happen everyday. Not here, not anywhere. Day shift is mainly quiet because even arch-criminals wait until night fall to pull something off. The metas follow the crooks and the cops follow the metas. Sit back, relax, get to know people. Things are cool."" An alarm goes off near the Main Monitor then, just to prove me wrong. ""David,"" I say. Dave's our police liaison and knows more about dirty deeds going down in the city than even the cops. ""Bank alarm, First National, 8th and Elm."" ""Timmy?"" ""Cameras are out in the bank, but mikes are still available."" He types into his computer. A second later, shots ring out across the Pit. The new guy ducks a little. ""Timmy, turn down the bass a little. Give me the closest camera that can see the front of the bank on the monitor."" ""Found one across the street."" A camera that looks down on the front of the bank shows a van a feet away from the door. ""Dave, tell Dispatch that a possible getaway vehicle is at the bank right now."" ""Sam, there's some weird sounds coming from the bank,"" Timmy says. ""On speakers."" The sound of a ton of rock being dropped on a steel floor is heard over and over again. Clump-clump-clump. ""Someone's coming out of the bank,"" Dave says. ""Zoom,"" I say. Something that glints in the morning sun and barely makes it underneath the frame of the bank door steps onto the sidewalk. Even from the height of the camera, it looks like solid steel carved into the shape of a naked man. On top of its head is a jagged piece of steel, almost like a Mohawk. Its chest is dented and scratched. ""What should I tell Dispatch?"" Dave says. ""Tell them we're gonna have to call someone a little higher up to deal with this."" I start walking towards the ACES machine."

"event","I push through the crowd getting off the train, drop a few quarters into a panhandler's cup for good karma, and walk the next two blocks to my office. Most people think we're housed in some skyscraper decked out in  
alabaster and chrome, but invisible to the naked eye; or some concrete bunker-complex thousands of feet underground. In a little place I call 'reality,' we're located a few blocks away from City Hall in the old fire station. Nothing particularly interesting. On the
outside, anyway. There's only one entrance to the building, so I have to wait a few minutes everyday while other people go through the scanners. 
First, you scan your ID card, which also takes a DNA sample. Then you walk through an airlock into another room covered in black tiles. You look into a red light that scans your eyes and face, while you say your 
name and password. After that, all you have to do is face the White Room and Donna. The White Room is what keeps investigative reporters, con artists and super-villains away from the office. The White Room has a scanner that detects any rouge particles, post-human abilities, nanotech viruses, mystical curses, even the onset of a cold. The Room was reverse engineered from the entrance to The Union's headquarters in New York. If the Room doesn't like you, it can, and will, 
obliterate you. At least, that's what I've heard. I've never seen it happen, but I always hold my breath while walking across the Room. I don't know if I've been brainwashed, possessed, coerced, or if I'm the 
carrier of some new super-plague. Neither does Donna, until I get to her desk. She's in her thirties, with long brown hair, ice-blue eyes and a nice smile. She has two kids, one in high school; the other just 
starting kindergarten. She knows me; I know her. But Donna will kill me with her mind in an instant if I so much as think about crossing the red line in front of her desk without her say so. She's a Level Four 
telepath and telekinetic, a rarity in the field. We were lucky to hire her before some corporate security firm snatched her up. I stand very still in front of
her until she's done. ""You always think that's funny,"" she says, finally, with a smile. ""What?"" ""Thinking about the time you stole a Nintendo game from your best friend's house. I don't know what is more cute; you feeling guilty about it or returning the game without even playing it."" I have to smile. ""I'd read in Scientific-American that psychics latch onto shameful thoughts first."" ""You were hoping I wouldn't pry to much into your head?"" she says and laughs again. ""Most days I thank God that I don't have to spend more time routing through people's petty fears and boring sexual fantasies. Besides, if I wanted to know what you were like in bed, I'd simply look."" And she smiles again, but in that way, the one that makes her different that other people. ""So, is everybody inside?"" ""Awaiting your orders, capitan. Go on in."" The vault-like door to her left opens and a rush of air and noise comes in. ""See
you later,"" she says as the door hisses shut."

"event","I gotta say, after everything that has happened to me, I still see the job as being mostly normal. I get up in the morning just like you. I take a shower, eat a healthy breakfast of last night's pizza, watch Tom 
and Jerry cartoons, check my email and the news on my OmniCom on the elevated train into work. It'll take a little longer to get in today, because Public Works is still trying to restore power and clean up debris on 
31st and Green from ArchMage's battle with the Dragon King Thursday. I heard that they're still trying to catch a flock of geese circling the city that used to be bystanders. We're about to cross 39th Street when the sound of gunfire breaks through the clack of the wheels under the train. The lights in the train dim and it feels like we're going faster. We're directly above 39th and I can see why the train is picking up speed. There's someone with four metal legs standing in the middle of the street for an instant, and in the next the legs have jumped three stories in the air, pausing upside down to fire something from one of the legs. It strikes a man in full body armor on top of a nearby three-story building. The suit's complete with helmet and looks like it's made out of smooth blue coral. The metal legs land on top of the three-story as the man falls backwards on the gravel roof. In the center of the legs is a laughing Asian girl in jeans and a green t-shirt wearing a jet fighter's helmet with the visor down. The legs, which she's wearing like a backpack, have a grabber claw on the one danging above her head and some sort of gun on the other that's a little lower, while the two attached to her legs must help her jump. The man in the coral suit responses to the laughter by making a weapon, a hybrid of a tuning fork and a vacuum cleaner, appear out of nothing and firing a bolt of energy at her. The girl's name is Grasshopper Gun, according to the papers, while I don't know who exactly the man is. The girl jumps high and the rest is blocked by the passing buildings. I put the OmniCom to my ear. ""Jo?"" ""Yes?"" ""Are we aware of what's going on at 39th at the moment?"" There's a pause. ""Police are on the way, along with a NEO agent."" ""Any casualties?"" ""Not yet. It just started."" ""Let me know if something changes."" ""Alright."""

"event","Since I've started this journal, I've stumbled in here at the end of December, half out of my head, and spouted off about the best and worst of my year. Well, I won't be doing that this year. Not because I sat in a dark room for the entire year, not talking or doing anything, but because I honestly don't want to think about everything that has happened. I would be happier, or at least a little happier, if I got wacked on the head and all my memories of this year. That way, I wouldn't have to relive it every few weeks like a war flashback. And most of the things that have happened aren't what most people would consider horrifying. The more strong-willed people I know would spend a few days drinking and having a laugh, then go on with their lives. But not me. Not at all. Sometimes I think I'm back there again, doing those things and I wake out it with the start. It's not like I've changed a lot since then. Only I feel tired a lot more. But you don't care, do you? You're too busy Christmas shopping or posting about your new tattoo or finding something new to listen to. You don't care that I'm weak, that I can't keep it inside all the time, that I want to pull this face off and throw it in the trash so I don't have to look at its sagging, dark, cold lumpiness. Goddamn. I can't think of anything worse for Christmas than being me, so I wish me on all of you. 

Take off."

"event","When I first saw her, I wondered what was wrong with her. After all, women like her don't normally serve hashbrowns, grits and toast at the Waffle House. No, women like her normally work at the mall at a nice clothing store or don't work at all, instead letting their families or husbands provide for them. So, to my shame, I assumed she must be damaged goods. It wasn't that her greeting to me or to any of the other customers in the busy restaurant was any different than the dozens of other waitresses at the dozens of other places I've eaten at. What made her strange in that place was just below her face. On the side of her neck was a red blotch, about the size of a half-dollar coin, studded with holes in a ring. It was the first thing I realized about her after her face. Egg-white skin, high eyebrows, dark, sparkling eyes. When she finally stopped in her bustle to take my order, she smiled, and I knew what it was like to see the desert sun rise in the morning: thankful that the desolate chill of the night was going to be burned away, but fearful that you wouldn't survive the heat of the day to see the sun set again. As she took my order, I felt pretty good that I'd come across this great find. After all, I'd only come in for an omelet and some coffee before work. Just before she left, I noticed her nametag. Cassandra. What perfect sense it made. Cassandra was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba in Greek mythology. Her beauty was so great that Apollo granted her the ability of prescience, or prophesy. However, when she didn't return Apollo's love, the sun god placed a curse on Cassandra ensuring that no one would ever believe her predictions. At that moment, the woman in question let a plate drop to the floor. A moment of silence rested on the restaurant, before the chatter starting back up. ""Yeah,"" said one fat man in a beard. ""There goes my whole week's pay,"" said another man in a camouflage baseball hat. She smiles, but with less wattage now, and hustles to the back for a broom. I'm tucking into my omelet when she returns. She forms a little eddy in the flow of traffic behind the counter as she sweeps up the broken ceramic plate. The sound made is like a Mediterranean wind gliding, winding, caressing, a wind chime. The other customers seem to somehow ignore the warm, rich, salty breeze blowing through them, but I can see the broom handle work as well in her hands as any fingers can pluck at a lyre. ""Oh, it's music!"" one woman said, finally. I felt something pull from within me, and thought about her neck, and what would-be Apollo had she scorned, and why she hadn't seen it coming. I drained the last dregs from my coffee cup. She wasn't around when I took my coat off the back of my chair and paid my bill, but I left a two dollar tip, not a great offering, but only one given not to offend. I pushed the door open, looked out into the morning sun and wondered what was wrong with me."

Now my rents want to fly me up to North Carolina to stay with my aunt and cousins. My rents are staying here but dont want me to gggrrreeaattt a plane ride by myself. I dont do that well with planes especially going by myself!!:( i'm trying to talk them into lettin me stay here or go and stay with my family memebers that live in the upper part of florida. So i guess i have to wait till tonight to see what happends. My orginal plans were to go to orlando this weekend to wet n wild  but guess that wont be happening. I sure hope it don't hit us!!!;(

""Screaming Infidelities""

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak,
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home

[1.]
I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home.

I'm reading your note over again
There's not a word that I comprehend,
Except when you signed it
""I will love you always and forever.""

[2.]
Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone
Making out.

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.

[1.]
I am alone
In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and
This bottle of beast is taking me home.

[2.]

Your hair, it's everywhere.
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear.
[Repeat Four times]"

Some of the ugliest things took the longest time to make
And some of the easiest habits are the hardest one's to break
And I'm not asking for value nor the pain but I am asking
For a way out of this lie

[Chorus]
Because I can't wait for you to catch up with me
And I can't live in the past and drown myself in memories

Welcome to nowhere and finding out where it is
And fixing your problems and starting over agin
Your feeding your ego with what you can see outside
And your killing yourself for not speaking your mind

[Chorus]

In memory

[Bridge]
I wonder why you make believe you live your life straight through me
I cannot understand why you question me and then you lie
I will not justify your way's I cannot show you an escape 
I do not know you any more, I never new you anyway"

I heard the alarm again n just felt like hittin snooze a couple more times but finally i got up ate breakfast and got ready. I didnt have my energy but let me tell yeh yhat sure changed before i left!!! As i was leaving there was a frog on top of my car right were i opned door. My mom had said oh gosh!! & started 2 laugh. i said what did u say as i was opening my door n gettin in & then i saw it i screamed so loud i bet that thing pissed on my car from screamin so loud lol I ran back to where my mom was standing laghing her head off. I realized then it was a frog. Boy I sure was awake after that. I got to school n it was actually fun. I meet this lady who sat next to me & her name was Venus and she told me she lived on Jupiter It took me a min i was thinkin is she crazy then she said jupiter st. N then my light bulb turned on:) I thought that was kinda cute and she is really nice. I ended up seein Josh 2!! We didnt get 2 talk that long cuz i had to go back to class we both had to go get our passwords change to log onto the computers but it was sure nice seein him. Then when i got home i took bobby to work in on the way we saw like 8-10 cop cars n the dive team heading on the highway n they were sure n a hurry.. As i was leaveing albertson's i could have almost killed myself sum wacky person decided to terrorized the stop sign because of him there is nuutin there now but a piece of medal stickin out of the groundLOL im just playin they no who they are lol i wonder when they are gonna put it back up!!!People like me need it therelol

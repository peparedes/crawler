I think so.

I've chosen to be a Graphic Design major. Why? No, really, I'm asking you. I know I don't have what it takes. There will be so many people better than me. I will never be able to keep up.

I am never able to keep up. 

I lost 30 over the past 5 months. I'm pretty proud of myself. I'm pretty mad at myself for caring. I still want to lost 20 more. Boys don't see the before and after, they only see the now. The now is still too fat to be considered ""dateable."" Why would I want someone whose only qualification for datability is weight-lessness? 

I want to be weightless.

I've been talking about suicide a lot, lately. I think I've scared my mom and my friend. I will never kill myself. I just wish I could. I can't because I still don't know. 

I still don't know."

"event","I wish I were smarter. 

Wait, can a person get smarter? 
Is smartness contingent on how much you know or what you do with what you have? 
What's the difference between smartness and  intelligence? 
Is smartness even a word?
Is a person born with a limit to their thinking capabilities? 
I think so. 
The mentally handicapped have a handicap...and I guess so do everyone else. But not in the usual sense of the word, maybe in the golf sense. A handicap in golf gives a person as many strokes as she needs to be equal with the other players so that each round is based solely on your own relative performance. Except, I guess in real life everyone's handicap is predetermined with only a little wiggle room. For instance, a mentally handicapped, or retarded person rather, would have a really high handicap, a 40-50, like a bad golfer. In other words she would be given a lot more lee-way in life because they just can't help it. They can lower their handicap some through practice and learning, but they're never going to be a Tiger woods with a handicap of 1. 
I guess the same would apply to everyone else too. We all have different handicap levels. Einstein would have like a 1< handicap, the average joe would have like a 20 handicap. This probably doesn't make sense unless you know about golf. It probably doesn't make sense at all. God, I'm such an idiot. Equating retarded to people to bad golfers. But whatever, my point is, my learning capabilities are already set so I just have to do with what I got. 

I want to have long, intelligent, meaningful conversations with people. I want my words to have meaning. I want to be insightful and witty and respected for it. 

I'm just not that way. But I think I could be. That's the worst part. I think I have it in me but I'm just too lazy to cultivate it. Klein saw it. I see it. But I ignore it.

If I were dealing with one of those literal Genies, I guess I would have to change my wish to: I wish I used my mind more 
or I wish I cared more 
or I wish I knew stuff 
or I wish I knew what to wish
or I wish for more wishes??

I don't know what's stopping me.

"event","It's been a little over two weeks since Charley reared his ugly head. I've written some about the experience in a personal journal that I might put for all the world to see soon, but for now, I'll leave with this tidbit that Charley has taught me. 

I love trees. 

Charley loved to knock them over. 

What took years to grow, a sudden gust wiped out in minutes. 

I can understand how a strong wind would bring some of the trees down, for instance the palm trees and dogwoods.  Still sad to see them gone, but understandable. 

However, I can't understand how a massive oak could just topple over. Those kind of trees I never think of as a seedling; they're born with deep roots and broad stretching branches.  They're the grandpa trees and should be treated as such, with respect and admiration. They're the ones that remind adults of summers past and inspire children in summers present. They are the ones that bear the burden of love expressed through a carving of a heart and initials. They provide shade for a picnic and a jungle gym for a wanna-be monkey. These trees have invested too much into our lives and have too many memories to be broken by a passing storm.

It disturbs me to see one of these great trees fallen, roots and all exposed.  It bothers me on two levels. The first level is more distant but still confirms my fear of getting old. All it takes is a little wind to knock down what I could spend my whole life building. I could build myself up to be a great person with character and morals, but in the end I am simply old and useless, waiting for someone to clear my remains. Sure there will be a whole in the earth for a while, but eventually it will be filled and I will be forgotten. 

The second level is much more present and nagging. I have lived my life as a half-hearted Christian my whole life. Sure, I continued to grow, but what good was it? I have no roots. When a storm approaches, I know I'm the first to go and I will be exposed. My roots, and lack there of, will be shown to the whole world. People will no longer be distracted by my beautiful branches covered with abundant leaves. My wide trunk will no longer portray security. They will see what my roots actually are: fleeting emotion and false conviction. I will wither and they will burn me. 


This entry was inspired by...well, not so much inspired by as motivated by or reminded by <lj user=""theevilbunny""> <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/theevilbunny/172466.html"">in this entry</a>. I've been thinking of writing it ever since Charley visited but I just never got around to it. So, thanks <lj user=""theevilbunny"">. I love your journal."

"event","Empty swing sets are sad. 

Empty playgrounds in general are sad, but I'm inclined to feel worse for the swings. Slides are used in their solid, stagnant form. Kids just slide down them. There is no real interaction. The slide looks the same empty as it does being used. The same with the monkey bars and the colorful playschool sets. They are always doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing--just sitting there contently. 

Swings are different. They need another object to bring movement and life. Without a child's rear in it, a swing's purpose is just to wait until a child comes along. 

When a swing does get lucky enough to be used, what a wonderful time. The child starts out by pumping her feet with every alternate dip. In, out, in, out, higher and higher she goes. She is never satisfied with her last swing, trying with each to gain height. On her swing upwards she leans back and stretches her feet out far in front of her. Her body is almost parallel to the ground and the tip of her hair brushes the dirt. On her swing backwards, she leans forward. She bends her knees and tucks her feet snuggly under her butt to make sure not to scrape the ground. In, out, in, out, higher and higher. She's almost there. Finally, she hits the wall. She can go no higher. Perhaps her wall is the highest tree branch within reach. Maybe she stops at one swing before a 360. Maybe its not very high at all, but just enough out of her comfort zone that she feels satisfied.  She makes her decent and gives up pumping her feet all together. Half way down she takes a leap onto the scattered grass below and lands on all four. She gets up, brushes off the dirt, and moves on.

The swing, in all this excitment, can't help but wonder where the child will hit the wall. Each child is different. The swing hopes she never hits it. The swing doesn't want to become dormant again. It doesn't want to sit around waiting for something to choose it and use it. It doesn't want to go through the excitement of the ups and downs again if, after, it is forgotten. It doesn't want to be a convenient source of amusement. It wants...I want to be the child."

The feeling only grows stronger. 
The way she does her hair. 
The way she doesn't care.
Every word a lie. 
I wish she'd just die.
She pretends to be matter of fact,
I know it's just an act.
She can't hide any longer,
I have finally found her.
But what I've caught,
Is slim to naught."

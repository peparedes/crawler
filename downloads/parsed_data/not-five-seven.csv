"event","I went to the Doctor's today, for the second time this week. It's funny, hilarious even when people call me on the couple of days to do shit,  when i can't go out of the house. i don't know when i'll be better but probably not before the weeks end. I took another culture and a blood test so hopefully by tomorrow or the next day i'll know whats wrong with me.  I still don't know what exactly to get james for his bday but i have ideas. Just no time to get it. GAH! I hate being sick. All i did today was go to the doctor's, take an oatmeal bath and sleep. When i got blood drawn the lady took initiative to  turn the vial up and down in front of my face five or six times. But I got  jack jack sticker. Haha. First doctor to give me a sticker in like 8 years. I had forgotten how much I like ska.  Thanks for reminding me FIF.  I'm on so many drugs right now. Something called Hydroxyzine which is a much stronger benadryl. and then Strong hydrocortisone and then ibuprofen.  I need more hot stuff for the throat. It still hurt like a bitch. Usually I don't have sore throats for more than like 3 days so this has got to be strep or mono or some other strong virus.  I miss being out of the house. I miss working out and swimming and James. Most of all i miss driving 90 in the slow lane. haha thats not what i miss the most but i'll leave that up to your imagination. SO since i didn't do the summer assign. for english.....i've decided to drop the class. Oh well I already have two other AP classes I can focus on. I'm kinda juiced for AP environmental science. We'll see,  It's hard to believe what state of mind i was in last time at this time of year. I've matured so much and i'm o glad. Last night I had a dream that not only I but all of my family was back in spain. I loved the feeling. I have to learn spanish because Spain is where I'm going to live, hands down."

It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else"

"event","today was kinda a carefree day. People are mean sometimes. I wanted today to be a little special but fuck that. It's funny reading people's comments. I'm really excited about the poetry unit we're starting cause i have a lot of motivation to write poetry. I have to make a mental note to see that movie with neve campbell and james franco. Tomorrow's st. patricks day..another holiday. holidays just aren't what they use to be. I really have to start doing homework or else i'm just gonna fuck up and i've come too damn far to fuck up. I'm hellof proud of myself..i've done surprisingly well and with all this shit going on...yeaaah. I think i've decided what i really need for part-time. Some guy to fuck around with and just have fun...one that doesn't go to skyline and one that fits my general perception of the right guy. i don't think i'll ever find a guy who will be totally committed to me but it's a problem i have to face and live with. maybe that's why i feel i just need someone to fuck around with and have fun cause i'm tired of this shit. Alright i'm done complaining for one day...later"

"event","Well i was correct when i said this morning that today would suck. I just shouldn't think or be allowed to drink. I AM BEYOND YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION SO YOU MIGHT WANNA TURN YOUR HEAD. Ballet was fun and tiring but i need to get back in shape and i love to dance. It's my thing to have to myself. no one can take that away. I'm sad hockey is done for a coupld weeks cause thats when i have the most fun...But Sunday was awesome. I feel gross and I'm not sure i wanna put the reason why in here...i'll leave it open for interpretation. GOD James Franco is my fucking god. he's so fucking hot. Tom Welling is kinda ok when he's mad...anger turns me on haha. I feel very repitative tonight but that's ok. Fuck you and your untouchable face......bastard. SIX MORE FUCKING MONTHS!!! i can wait..i can wait..
The mood option is kinda dumb. I mean, im sore, im bored, i'm pissed off, eh. i'm grossed out and something else but i cant think of the word..i'm hot too. People have been asking me if i'm ok or whats wrong a lot lately, so i've noticed..I guess it's cause i daze off and daydream and wish and think up weird things..i'm fine....if fine only meant fucked up and confused 

I am not a pretty girl
that is not what i do
i ain't no damsel in distress
i don't need to be rescued
so put me down punk
wouldn't you prefer a maiden faire?
isn't there a kitten stuck up a tree somewhere?
i am not an angry girl
but it seems like i've got everyone fooled
every time i say something they find hard to hear
they chaulk it up to my anger and never to their own fear
imagine your a girl just trying to finally come clean
knowing for well they'd prefer you were dirty and smiling
and i am sorry
but i am not a maiden faire
and i am not a kitten stuck a tree somewhere
..................
and what if their are no damsels in distress?
what if i knew that and i called your bluff?
don't you think every kitten figures out how to get down
whethere or not you ever show up."

"event","Yeah. so last night I finallu got out of the house for the first time in weeks it felt like but umm yeah. Me and deja and kellyn and robby and the chans and adam went to lake temescal and jumped off the dock. I had trouble getting out of the water which sucked but it was awesome. Today was cool too cause we had hockey. and we won the first game and lost the second. During the games i hung out with dylan and jose and they kept throwing ice down my shirt but i guess you have to sacrifice something to gain another...after i was pissed cause i didn't get to play that much in the second game but eh...i was also just thinking and i guess i shouldn't think that often cause they're often sad thoughts...lonely thoughts...You know that feeling that you'll always be alone? well i feel that CONSTANTLY."

"event","i havn't had a real post in awhile so i think now is a great time for one. things are getting better.  my back dosn't hurt so much anymore, my leg does though but thats something that i think physical therapy can fix.  i have been working alot lately. and i think that i am doing something right cause my boss is trying to get me to become a manager.  i'm just not sure if i want the job or not cause that would mean i would work alot more and i would have atleast one closing shift which would probably be on sundays.  sundays suck cause were always slow especially now that football is over.  tonight we sent one of are drivers on a run and it took him an hour and forty-five minutes and he never even found the house.  the problem being that he was over by 19th street and the customer lives in chamber creek.  need less to say my boss was a little pissed off cause we all thought something bad had happened to him. so he is on probation now and my boss told him that if he ever leaves for a delivery again without a map book she would fire him.  this isn't the first time we have had a problem with getting lost. other then all this though life is going great.  my parents went to the home show a couple of weeks ago and decided to buy a hot tub so we will getting that sometime in the next couple of weeks.

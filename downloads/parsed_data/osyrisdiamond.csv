<i>Show title translation from Latin, ""I Was Not, I Am Not, I Care Not."" It was the old-school Greek version of Rest In Peace. Okay, peoples, I'll give you the skinny: we brought our Mac Pro to its knees; literally! So, while Wild-Reto & Rain are back (Huzzah for Reto!!!) we had several recording fuck-ups during the two hours (and when we tried to shut the computer down after recording, it crashed... Mac black screen of death!). We lost a total of 57 minutes of material! FUCK!!! So we're just gonna give you the links this episode; you'll have to listen to the show to get the scoop... and no, there is no Centennial malt; just like the dueling churches over dog souls stories were indeed created & thus are fictitious. Sux. :(

<u>Show Notes: 15 August 2009</u>
<i> Take 3! (Again!) Only an hour this time... brewing took too much out of the others & Osyris was recovering from a bad case of McDonald. The studio fridge is finally operational! Johnny-B & Glacier Wulf discuss the latest home-brew, first in the new place (& in two years or so). [Correction: there was 14.5lbs of malty grain used in the brew, not 12lbs.] We talk -again- about whom Osyris is likely a ""Bi-In-Denial"" & female issues. ""Crouton"", which is the given name currently for my girl Bengal cat. Lava lamps (yes, we now have two!) in da studio! We don't have the doom dice tonight, or Dutchie or Dark-Lilith, so we're winging it. First, we head to Dvorak Uncensored blog & listen to American President Obama make a great gaff about the U.S. Postal Service. We also browse several other blog posts before switching to Failblog & skim through three pages of fail. Among other topics, we give our two-cents about child discipline & spanking. Then we watch an epic fail unicyclist via Failblog before Osyris goes into a ""reverse racism"" rant. Due to the day's events, we consider a 20min. break before deciding not to & check out the BBC World Service News & ranting briefly about the red cards give out at the Sounders/Galaxy MLS match (2-0w). After stumbling through a mini-rant about the bullshit surrounding Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma/Myanmar, & briefly talking about Secretary of State Clinton (& her more famous husband) Osyris finally give Israel hell (again) about the Palestine conflict. Wanna come on the show & give us a piece of your mind? E-mail us & we'll make it happen! (See address below...)

"event","From <a href=""http://xiao-feng-fury.deviantart.com/journal/24046681/"">Distraction tactics of the enemy</a>; as rebuffed by me:

""<i>Since your entire reality and its rationale is based solely on an unprovable hypothesis, ""God"", I can never truly take your arguments as anything more than mere ramblings... especially since you have only ever succeeded in proving how little you follow the example of your ""savor"", Jesus the Christ. The self-righteous and condemning nature of your diatribes is an insult to the legacy of this otherwise influential figure, factual or mythical, in world history. I see more hatred and disdain in your proselytizing than anything Jesus ever gave in his teachings or life, even at his more furious when overturning the money tables in the Temple at Jerusalem. Even the rebukings of Paul to the various fledgling Churches throughout the eastern Mediterranean were more civil and constructive than the bile that you continue to flood this journal with.

If you have to reject all critiques of yourself in order to keep ""pure"" and from possible questioning your faith, then you can never grow or learn and such only leads to a stagnation of intellect and disconnect from being honest with yourself and others; not to mention that it only illustrates how weak your devotion and convictions truly are. If you are truly an emissary of your ""savor"" and thus live the example that he laid out for all those who should come and follow him, then I will never find such a philosophy ever appealing and will gladly take up ""arms"" to quell such appalling and destructive delusions. Jesus said to ""love thy enemy""; you, my dear, show no such love. I will ""give my heart"" to the Jesus that has ""kept and blessed"" my grandparents long before I ever submit to the demon you preach of.</i>""

If you ever want to rot your brain, start reading this deviant's journal entries. I've butted heads with her before and while I was trying to be civil and honest with her, the verbiage and dogma this ""woman"" spews out has made me conclude that her interpretation of Jesus is not only bullshit but not even in line with the text she claims to uphold and preach from. It will be interesting to see her response. Just because I know the text likely better than she does does not bode well for our conversations. She doesn't believe I was ever once Christian or have any worthy insight into Christianity. Why? Because she is right and everyone else who disagrees with her is wrong. So what is the point of my response? Two fold: to be honest; to her and myself. She is basically talking about what I wrote... so I gave her what she wanted. Too bad she's too blinded by ""the truth"" to take the hint that she might not be as perfect in her interpretation as she claims."

"event","This is the body of a latter I sent to a few noted skeptics as a response to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Skeptic"">Junior Skeptic</a> Editor Daniel Loxton's <a href=""http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhereDoWeGoFromHere.pdf"">Where Do We Go From Here?</a> and <a href=""http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhatDoIDoNext.pdf"">What Do I Do Next?: Leading Skeptics Discuss 105 Practical Ways to Promote Science and Advance Skepticism</a>, which was featured on <a href=""http://www.skepticality.com/"">Skepticality</a>; three times! (Look up episodes 63, 86, & 98).

<i>Firstly, awesome podcast to one and all; and same for the new manifesto, part duo. After reading both works by Loxton (et. al.) and listening to accompanying podcasts, I feel somehow vindicated for my small efforts and pursuits in promoting skepticism and ""fighting the good fight"" as it were. The 'next steps' list read more like a to-do list that I kept crossing off in certain areas. Granted, this number is quite small compared to the total 105 listed, but the emotional boost was a plus. I would be surprised if no one makes a podcast series out of this, first starting with the original essay and then working through all 105 suggestions. You have a minimum of 106 episodes already, plus any dual-length episodes or expanded topics and possible interviews. By then, the supposed next step in this evolving process of 'evolving skepticism into the modern world' as joked about in the most recent podcast will have been published, allowing for even more content. One might also take up this task from a more ""Joe-Skeptic"" angle; that is, to take these idea from the perspective of a skeptic not of the ranking of Randi, Dunning, Swoopy, or Watson. It's an idea worth exploring. As for myself, I already try to promote skepticism in my own podcast that covers anything and everything (with commentary all around), in the various postings I make around the interwebs, in my poetry and writing, in my own personal and social life, at work and school, and even am a member of a Bigfoot ""research"" group as their Official Skeptic (whether or not I'm just the token skeptics is debatable but I'm so-far respected and have not been ostracized ...yet), though so far I have done much of my musing with them through their forums (I'm temped to lead a ""field expedition"" this summer just for kicks and for the chance to get out into the woods and see what critters and evidence we can 'spook' up!). I'm not making much of a splash but a splash is made and apparently that's what counts.

Some things I have noted in my own interactions with the skeptical movement give me pause to reflect on things. What bugs me to no end about the skeptical movement is the apparent adherence to rhetoric. It is one thing to read a homeopathic claim and have one's doubts, it is quite another to denounce someone's personal experience offhand. It's not that I think they are on to something or should be used as empirical evidence; rather, I fear we as a movement are losing too many potential ""converts"" due to how many situations are handled. We might not have dogma in the skeptical movement, but you don't need it for others to think that you do. A personal face need to be put back on the name skeptic and believers alike. While shows like ""Skeptics Guide to the Universe"" are an invaluable resource of information and entertainment for skeptic (and believer), certain talking points and buzz-words, or what appear to be, are all too often sounded-off like at a political rally. While it might better resemble rhetoric as Sophocles and Aristotle knew it, far too often this verbiage resembles the contemporary definition with all its negative and dastardly connotations. As was made clear in an episode of ""Skepticality"", when a Seattle skeptic overturned many preconceived notions about The Discovery Institute, while affirming others, we skeptics must be careful not to start categorizing believers based on assumed knowledge and stereotypes. Just as skeptics are trying to put a human face back on the movement, there is a very human face to all those who see the world differently, if incorrectly. This effort to re-envision skepticism will utterly fail if the diatribe we speak presents this face-lift as merely a mask to cover an ugly stereotype, which would then prove more fact than fiction. We must be careful to remember that such generalizations are made for a reason, and that the truthful basis for such otherwise bias and narrow-minded views are often much larger than many would like to admit. We must also be sure not to dismiss the concerns or even complaints of believers about skeptics; even the hypocrite can make a valid point. If rhetoric is a ""necessary evil"", then let it be less about the fundamentals of science as the only way to truth and more about personal relations that bring real change to people who more likely than not truly search for the truth. The rest just comes naturally, as it were. While podcasts and other mass audience forums need a more generalized approach, their model for success should not be the foundation of the ""man on the streets"", which appears more commons than not.

I find myself less interested in involving myself with most skeptical groupings or events, like forums, local meet-ups, talks, etc., and prefer to listen to podcasts and do my own promotion through my own channels. The reason is simple: I feel stupid and useless in them. It is one thing to expect a certain level of knowledge in a given area, quite another to demand it like a proficiency test to get into MIT or Harvard. Few of us have the time and resources to be adept at a great many things or topics, and certainly for skeptics this broad pool of information is of utmost importance. It is the cornerstone of our ability to understand the world for what it truly is and for how we defend this rational and scientific view of reality. Yet there is a sense of superiority and pompous in many of these skeptical social gatherings that is a major turn off. I do make an effort to acknowledge the failings of the human condition in these instances and admit feeling the arrogance all too often present when one knows that others who are steadfast in their ways are lacking a more clear understanding of reality. This said, when I browse a skeptical forum, I feel I can offer nothing to the conversation and find some of the conversations being had rather disheartening. I also fully admit for sounding off like a bigot on certain religious issues when my banter and opinion gain their peak during my rantings and enjoy inflaming those I might otherwise wish to persuade to my point of view, or at least debate with constructively. However, the line between personal opinion, ranting, and objective understanding are all too often lost in the mix. Like what is seen on any of the news outlets over the last decades, opinion and fact have not been given proper distinguishing lines; such is even more of a problem online. As for the face-to-face skeptical meetings, many reflect the boring features of bible studies from my youth, except there is science in place of scripture and usually beer (both of which I will NEVER complain about). I feel unfulfilled, like with some podcasts. Maybe my experiences are just that ad I do not reflect even a minority of skeptics, but I speak out anyway. While the group gatherings and fellowship with other skeptics is akin to religious believers and church, from a sociological perspective, I think a promotion of ""the lone skeptic"" might help more become more active in ""spreading the faith""... or lack thereof, as it were. Not everyone can serve in such socially-based ways ad it is likely a benefit to have those who are able to go their own way in furthering ""the good fight"". Standards will always be needed to ensure quality but how they are kept can be done with a lot more heart and a lot less ego by certain individuals. We all are on a never-ending journey to acquire new knowledge ad should never forget it.

I know some of these observations have been touched on in the two essays but I speak them to say my peace. I will continue my own efforts and hope you all will yours. I think these essays are on the right track to breathing new life into the skeptical community. To further this discussion, I will be making then an ""open letter"", that is, I will also be posting it to a couple of my web-logs. (Just F.Y.I.) Hopefully something worthwhile will come of it all. Until then, thank you all for your time.</i>

"event","Seriously? What the bloody [explicative deleted] is up with people? No matter where I go or what I do, people gotta make drama. It can be a 'clear day with a nice temperature and after the bills are paid with cash left over' type of vibe going on and someone somewhere will find it and turn the groove into drama. I don't understand this. I go to my art page where I post my poems and stories and there's drama about something the site staff did about changing policies. True, how they did it (again) was dumb and did not take into account logic and reason; but why make drama about it? How is that constructive? Where do people get off on this stuff? Then I go to the skeptical sites and once again some quack doctor has convinced another dumb politician to pimp his [explicative deleted]; the only thing more sad than this fail of logic, reason, and our governmental process is the rhetoric about 'how bad this is and who's fault it is and how those who don't immediately start rising up in arms is not a real skeptic'. Drama from people who try to pimp science and logic and reason are acting like children who wanna exclude so many people who don't think they they do that by the time their little personal drama inquisition is over, they only have themselves left to fight for. To error is human, they say. To create drama is to be void of substance and meaning and lacking anything remotely better to do. [explicative deleted] Then I wonder over to the Bigfoot world... bad mistake! [explicative deleted]!? Wow, when did I return to second grade? Seriously? I haven't seen this type of selfish simpleton drama since before I knew what the term drama even meant. Instead of trying to prove a valid point that might help their case to the rest of the world, they go on and on about how one group need to go [explicative deleted] while they are the only real group worth listening to and joining. Drama this bad and obvious needs to be quarantined and those within its grasp need to be hit repeated with rabid beavers and wet cats. I know drama fiction novels with less drama than what I'm reading on the interwebs! [explicative deleted] It's like a wreck with a train and a school bus full of kindergarteners. Any more whining and I've have to call child protection services to see which dumb parent left their children unattended in these forums. Then, I leave and go check the news. [explicative deleted] Can someone explain to me why everyone keeps saying ""create or save 3,000 jobs""? Besides the fact that this number has been either quoted or misquoted many times in various amounts, but why does no news organization ask ""why is there a 6,000 job difference in this figure and how will you measure that?"" No, they have to be focused on poorly worded bonus legislation for the bailout so now they are trying to make up for it by taxing it by 90%. Seriously? Good luck trying to get any court to keep it from being rejected as illegal and unconstitutional. What is worse, some are arguing that this is just a cover for the incompetency of those who originally wrote the terms to the bail out. [explicative deleted] Thank you, Captain Obvious. How is that any reason not to sign this legislation. Are you suggesting that we just throw our hands up and let AIG take the tax payers money just so we can expose the poor wording that got us into this quagmire? How about using my previous argument about it not being able to hold up in our court system? Drama from the left; drama from the right. [explicative deleted] Then I turn to international news and see more of the same economic [explicative deleted]. What's worse, people are now complaining how other people's opinions are hurting them and now they want UN resolution to make it denial of basic human rights for someone in question or insult another's religious beliefs! Seriously? Drama alert! I thought this ""everyone is a winner"" and ""you're not a loser, just the last winner"" [explicative deleted] was only force-fed to American kids during the elementary school days. Now people want that on a global level? Who are they? What god-given authority gives them the right to tell me they are right and I am wrong? Give me good evidence and I might consider it but if you're gonna force me to kiss your [explicative deleted] and that of your reality, then I will show you drama! I swear if this planet stopped having drama for one day, one hour, one minute, one second, it would explode and take the universe with it! Well, at least this is the death grip people use to keep the drama alive. OMFG! DRAMA 4EVR! If I could collect half a cent for every time I ran into drama, I would be orders of magnitude richer than the entire value of the largest diamond in the galaxy, which happens to be a white dwarf star (if memory serves) that is several times larger than the Earth. If drama was a cure for what ales you, we'd all be immortal! I am very skeptical that this will ever change in a positive direction, that is, less drama.

Well, here is something that made me feel good. For those of you who don't know (likely all of your), I consider myself a fringe-fur. Yep, a Furry; about as not-so Furry as you can be and still be Furry. Yeah, so anyway I was in a giving mood with my check from the government (and a quarterly bonus from work). After giving to a good friend (<a href=""http://kaios.deviantart.com/"">Kaios @ deviantart</a>, <a href=""http://www.modelmayhem.com/492865"">Kaios @ modelmayham</a>, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/27015118@N06/"">Kaios @ flickr</a>) down in Australia to help her and her small business (<a href=""http://members.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&userid=vitaeshop"">Vitae @ Ebay</a>, <a href=""http://www.02.01.snc1.facebook.com/pages/Adelaide-Australia/Vitae-Clothing-and-Accessories/58884920513"">Vitae @ Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/vitaeclothing"">Vitae @ myspace</a>, <a href=""http://aetasvitae.blogspot.com/"">Vitae @ blogspot</a>) get some stuff done, I wanted to give some more. (BTW, you should check our my friend and buy some stuff from her because she ad her stuff are awesome!) So, remember there was a <a href=""http://www.ranting-gryphon.com/index.htm"">certain Gryphon</a> who last I heard was needing some fund, I give to the ""Tunes/Songs for Saturn"" effort. No, there is not such a thing specifically, but read <a href=""http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com/199679.html"">Tunes for Saturn</a> to find out more... then read <a href=""http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com/202247.html"">Some advice?</a> and the very first part of <a href=""http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com/204189.html"">Mamma Mia!</a> Okay, so to make this long story short, now read <a href=""http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com/206509.html"">Songs For Saturn... more.</a> ...and note the fact of why I mentioned my Furriness, 'cause I have another persona for this fringe-fur side of me named Mother Russia, the Red Howler Monkey. (Maybe I have mentioned it before?) I hate to even mention this 'cause I never expected what the mighty Gryphon has proposed to do but hey, he is awesome and I wanted to give him some air time since he gave me some air time. You shouldn't need rewards to help others, especially those who have touched and help you become a better you; this is just a random side benefit. I am just glad I kept him motivated to get the album done; his music is awesome and while I love the podcast (and his current music, of course), he really needed to get some new music out. I miss my periodical Gryphon spooge in my ears from the language he squeezes from his face!

"event","Yeah, if things were not already bad, one of our sick little kitties is likely diabetic. Spangle had some blood and urine samples (feces, too, once we can find one that's hers). Still, the short version is her results were very indicative of being diabetic; until the vet (at the  VCA Covington Animal Hospital) did a demonstration of how to check her blood. That result was more in line with a nervous/stressed animal than one diabetic. So now we're (still) testing her blood to see if a pattern can be established. With some of her physical limitations and traits, she likely still has it; now it's more to determine how much insulin to give her. Specifically, she has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_in_cats_and_dogs"">Diabetes mellitus</a>. Hopefully it's not too much to treat her (long term) but quality of life for both us and her then becomes a question. Hate to say it so we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

On a more positive note, both cats are drinking more on their own, though food is still given manually (as with a little water if needed). Star is up a lot more and actively getting water and staying out in the open (usually near the sun). Spangle still enjoys the closet but she is also doing better in her sickness. The next step is for both to start eating again on their own."

"event","My poor kitty Star is sick with a sinus infection! We brought him in to the vet (VCA Covington Animal Hospital) this morning thinking he might have a broken or infected tooth. This diagnosis is otherwise welcomed news, considering the alternatives. With some amoxicillin on hand, he should be back up to specs in a few weeks. We also got some Advantage (liquid flea control delivered on skin) for both cats. Speaking of which, Spangle will likely be going in once Star is well so we an figure out what is wrong with her back legs and a odd decrease in her weight.

I think during his time there, the chances Star was planning to kill me went from 89% to 200%!"

"event","You ever have one of those times where you wanna slap yourself? This would be one of those times for me. Why? Because we recorded episode 005 (for the podcast) this last Saturday (1/31) with special fill-in co-host Dutchie and a ton of good stuff to talk about and even a new idea abut how to structure the Doom List... and NOTHING was recorded! Why? Because I forgot to appearently double check which drivers were feeding into Garageband. So, I have 01:08:34.313hrs:mins:secs.milisecs of pure silence. I am very much tempted to just have the background music play and post it anyway as a tribute to such an epic fail. Will I do this? Well, I'll decide once my co-hosts are consulted. So, what did we (I) learn from all this? Will we ""re-record""? I don't know, depends on what I/we agree on. If you see 005 titled ""Ode to Fail"" you'll know the answer...

1) Osyris is indeed full of fail...
2) Make sure to double check your input drivers/feeds before pressing record."

"event","When the topic came to <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/"">determinism</a>, until recently I was as confused and troubled about it as anyone. However, I think after <a href=""http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2009/01/episode-29-free-willy-vs-determinator.html"">listening to some people explain it</a> (<a href=""http://doubtreligion.blogspot.com/2009/01/episode-30-fwvd2-judgement-day-with.html"">and its potential consequences</a>) I got my mind wrapped around it. I first realized driving home one night that what determinism is reflects very much a computer. Everything is a part of a large program (processed by a relatively tiny computer) that goes into who you are and what you do.

<b>For example, your basic brain (reptile as some call it) is the base code like DOS or something similar. Your body is the hardware and linking the two (body to brain) is a ton of machine code. From there, the higher processes are the various coding that builds upon itself become a modern O.S. like Mac X or Windows. All the outside forces currently interacting with you is like a combined user/multiple users that delivers new software, files, and the like. You, as your sentient conscious self, become an artificial intelligence that can understand its existence without consciously knowing or feeling all the coding that is making it run. This A.I. is yet another user and allows for upgrades and installations of program and new knowledge file but is not quite a full admin (perhaps like a superuser but not a root user, to use Linux terms). While the A.I. (that is, you) can start and run programs, what makes those things happen is not on a conscious level (i.e. a processor crunching numbers or a background system doing its thing). The lag between when an input is delivered and an output is delivered is much like how our conscious can effect the future but the present is already in motion from input from the past. All these things described are constantly being updated and expanded upon largely as background programming or user input as 'time progresses'.</b>

Of course this is not a perfect juxtaposition but such examples never are. Another perspective might sum it up better, if in a truly different context. For my class of Greek Tragedies I found many parallels to how (I believe) Greeks saw Fate in relation to free will (or lack thereof). I provide the following discussion prompt for Oedipus Rex by Sophocles that illustrates my conclusion:

""<b>What is free will? Does it exist? Who has it? During the time of Sophocles, the greatest of minds debated these (a similar debate persists today between natural determinism* and free will** ). The playwright explores the notion between fate and free will in Oedipus Rex. It is unclear why Laius sought an oracle regarding his son, but his reaction to its answer began the spiral that saturates the entire (Theban) trilogy. Hubris plays a huge role; this veridical contempt for the future was a sign of personal shortcomings, the same that these oracles allude to in the play. What these oracle patrons fail to grasp is what determines fate is their own actions. Like the modern argument of determinism, many factors culminate in certain events unfolding. What humans forget is what we consider our sentient self is an integral part of this equation. What the characters reject is the notion they could contribute to this foretold future; had they looked inside themselves and sought counsel to improve their failings, such visions would become void since the factors affecting the future had now altered. This insight does not signify fate but rather explains that free will is an illusion. What the gods understood and try to teach humans is they were not the sole contributor to how their life unfolded; and to ignore such was a fatal error: Fate held a mirror but the person had to see their reflection.</b>

<i>*Natural Determinism: All actions are the sum of all inputs from the Big Bang (and before) until the present. Thus, a conscious/sentient mind only interprets a given action in real time, but is still an input for future actions.
**Free Will: All actions are the sum of all inputs that a separate entity (homunculus, soul, etc) then takes into account before responding to stimulus, or not.</i>""

Well, that's my two-cents about the subject. As for how I found peace with the idea that I (nor anyone else) am(/is) not in direct control on my(/their) life: the idea (determinism) did not really bend from my previous views of reality and free will as I first thought, for I realized that I did believe that our past and the environment we live in (plus other unknown or unrecognized factors) played a part in who we are and how we determine our life, just not to the extent that determinism reasons. In this, if one can acquire a less self-centric view of reality and accept that they are not the only people/factors of importance or who an affect on one's life, then the only leap to be made is one of orders of magnitude rather than a complete philosophy change.

Your take?"

"event","Okay, I am about to bitch about something ultimately trivial; deal with it...

<b>I am new at podcasting, I grant them that. I am not into video production, I grant them that. I am not ""professional"", I grant them that... but I can say they are either. I find it highly offensive that someone who can produce a podcast of reasonable quality would not be found able to make a podcast for a anime convention. Srsly!? Yes, I am not into video and I would understand finding someone else to do that part; it makes sense and I even recommended it. However, to suggest that I am unable to produce an -audio- product that properly suits their needs when the quality I have seen thus far of their overall publicity, especially in the video department, is lacking in many key areas. Granted, I have little audio evidence from them to judge but if the audio quality from their commercials are any indication, I can run rings around anyone else they could find willing to do such a podcast. Okay, so I admit the grandeur and scale of what I though the one podcast, now better split into audio and video feeds, but I don't see their logic for why they do not think I am up to the task. While the logistics during the convention itself would be daunting, a simple podcast to arrogate information during the off-season (only) could more than easily be met by someone of my skill and I could easy produce a product superior to anything thus far that the con publicity has created thus far; hands down. I am very much tempted to inquire to more specific for why I am not qualified. Should I push the subject? What did I do wrong? Did I present my case in a poor way? Do they not want a S.A.S. member trumping your ability to promote the con? It the podcast really just too redundant and they are just being nice to placate me!? Forgive my hubris here but you won't find someone more willing and dedicated to the cause in this regard than yours truly. Forgive my arrogance for saying that I don't think they are qualified to make that decision, regardless of the position of authority you may occupy. How about instead of just saying 'thanks but no thanks' they ask me to prove myself. There's an idea. It doesn't have to be for the 2009 con. I know this is totally not the mature way to handle rejection but I'll be damned if these bastards take my idea and determine I am unworthy of making it a reality. This is why I so rarely contribute to anything anymore. You give a good idea that no one else thinks of, then you're brushed to the side while they take it in due time and make it their own like they came up with it all by their self. God, the only thing more childish and stupid is how I'm feeling right now about this whole matter but the fact is I feel greatly insulted, dejected, patronized, degraded, and all the other emotions that come along when you are told your idea is great, except for the part where you participate in it...</b>

[I know the very very few of you who might read this will be questioning just what I am going on about. I intentionally keep this vague but I provide enough information to give you the basics. Anyone who knows me enough should know exactly what this is about. Thankfully, so few people run across this blog (if lj a blogging service or not?) that I feel slightly secure about posting this publicly... and if they do come across it, so what? It's obvious I'm not qualified and I am reasonably assured any inquiry I make to change their minds would be rejected without real consideration.]"

"event","<i>I'm sure some form of what I'm about to write on has been tried or proposed; but I think it needs to be said again... my only regret is that no one of any influence in this matter will read this; or even take it to heart. (And yes, I intentionally put up a provocative title to gain your attention.)</i>

How do we solve the issues facing Israel and Palestine? Can they be solved at all? The answer to the latter is certainly yes; however, it will take a lot of maturity and resilience on all sides to do and will not be easy. It will take the efforts of many Middle Eastern countries giving up a lot of their pride and egos (and land) to make this work but it is achievable. What is the answer that will solve the issues? <b>Build a Palestinian state!</b> Yes, it is no the be-all- tell-all cure-all answer but my lengthy explanation below should prove a best case for finally bring more peace to the region. Other Arab countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Damascus, Syria, Jordan, and others along with the U.N., America, and E.U. will be call to help make this idea a reality. The Palestinian people will also have to help make this a reality. A lot of hardships await this idea and it might even be impossible a goal to reach, but I think it is worth noting.

Again, various parts and incarnations of my proposal might have already been tried (or still are) but certain basic fundamentals of country and population conduct is key to my plans here: firstly, all sides of this issue must realize that Israel is not going anywhere and for better or worse is now a legitimate state. It must also be acknowledged that all sides share in the guilt that was led to the current situation and that full acknowledgment of this must be made by the parties involved. Next, the ability not to reach in a reflexive and hasty manner to those who would otherwise try to stop this process must be in place; violence should only be met with violence in reserved and limited instances. Maturity on all sides is paramount and childish behavior cannot be tolerated from anyone. Concessions will have to be made on all sides for the good of the entire region but through them lasting peace might be better achieved.

<b>Building a Palestinian State</b>
Along with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and as many other Middle Eastern states as possible, Israel must design and bring before the United Nations a resolution (not unlike the one used to make the Israeli state) that would call for the creation of a Palestinian state. This new country would likely encompass the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and other concession territory donated from neighboring states (including Israel). It would be completely sovereign and given a seat in the U.N. It would likely called Palestine and be home to all Palestinians and others living within the territory. It would be democratic and run as the people see fit. All parties associated with the resolution would agree to be contributors to the initial creation and allies of the new state until such time as a elected representative government was elected by the people. It capital would not be Jerusalem but an equally important city as favored by Palestinians.

All participating states must be resilient towards any violence from militant groups (like Hamas or Hesbola) and only in specific outlined instance would a postponement be made and a majority vote of the resolution group could approve this. Israel would have to offer full apologies for how they treated the Palestinian people over the decades and allow more humanitarian supplies into the current Palestinian regions during this process (again, only stopping if the situation truly calls for it by a vote of the resolution group). Similarly, the other countries bordering the Palestinians would also open their border to relief aid. Other countries and groups like America, the European Union, and others would have to place their support behind this resolution and help in aiding the Palestinian people during the process; though it would be best that the resolution group members all be from the Middle East. The resolution, once complete, would only be held up should certain requirement attached to it not be met.

The first is that the Palestinian people must be willing to remove their affiliation from groups like Hamas and be willing to help capture and turn in those suspected of war and humanitarian crimes. It should be made very clear at the beginning of this that peace is the objective of this resolution, along with restoration of a people, and that all will be done to make the Palestinian state a reality so long as the Palestinians are willing to remove themselves from the company of those who wish violence and must accept the existence of Israel. The people of Palestine should be incentivised by the brokering of this state despite any bombings or attacks made by groups who are against Israel. They must also be willing to accept the apologies of Israel for their mistreatment of the Palestinian people and the offers of reparation (that should be generous) and promise of support for the new state. All sides must lean to forgive the past mistakes and actions, while certain crimes at an international level will still be open to investigation and prosecution. Once militant forces are removes from power and influence, then the resolution, once completed and finalized, will come into being.

The details of this process I would leave to the resolution members but this basic outline would be the catalyst for a more lasting peace. Again, it would require the rejection of the current ""eye for an eye"" ""we are in the right"" mentalities that fuel all sides of the current issues and come together to look beyond the petty differences and work together despite those who wish conflict. Egypt has shown itself to be apt at this in recent times and it would be advisable that Israel and Egypt be the first to take up this idea and compel their neighboring states to join in the U.N. resolution for a Palestinian state. Obvious, though it must still be said, that legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people must be included in this member group to be sure the concerns and interests of the Palestinian people themselves are heard, considered, and met. It would take many years to complete but it would do much more good for the region to show so much unity and resolve in the face of growing tension and political instability. Again, outside influences should be kept in check but U.S. and E.U. support and perhaps even advice could be beneficial to the process. The end result/goal should be something the benefits the whole Middle East, and thus the world at large."

"event","I'll make this quick and simple; then we'll get back to my Twilight idea...

How many bloody people does this skanky little country need to kill to make itself feel safe!? How many people has Hamas killed in this latest round of fighting? Now, take that number and compare it to the amount of civilians lives lost on Gaza; then against the number of people working directly for Hamas. Where does this make sense? To make your own people feel safe because Hamas can only fire rockets into your country where they generally only do minor damage and occupationally take a life or two? Okay, let's play the numbers game again. Take all the Israeli people killed since the founding of the modern state verses all the aggressor states and factions, and related civilian populations, and see if the numbers are still justified. Nope. Right then, one must admit the safety of one own people is paramount for ta government... okay, well, it should be; let us assume this. Hamas has made it very clear Israel needs to be removed from the map in a very violent way. This is on Hamas; so is their inability to comprehend what a cease-fire agreement means, let alone how to ""properly"" interpret the Koran. Then again, they are not the first to have beef with the existence of the modern state of Israel. History lesson time!

If memory serves, the Palestinian territory was once ruled by Great Britain. The locals had their differences but the Jews and Muslims seemed to have a better relation with each other. Then when England wanted out, the Palestinians were assured of their own state. Everyone seemed content with the idea. Then World War Two came along and suddenly, Israel was born! O.M.F.G.! Why? Because the whole of Europe was feeling a bit guilty after centuries of anti-Semitic finally boiled over into the ""Final Solution to the Jewish Problem"". [Yep, Jews have been hate most everywhere they go, save one or two spots.] After making it look like a ""out of left field play by Germany, the United Nations created the modern state of Israel to make themselves feel better... and to give a place to put all the Jews so the Europeans would not be tempted to go at them again. Huzzah! Problem solved! Well, what about those (now) displayed and disenfranchised Palestinians? Surely Israel would see they got the raw prawn and would help them integrate into Israeli life and things would be as good if not better from when before Great Britain left (yes, I know it wasn't all ""love and peace"" but it was certainly better than what was about to happen).

Israel apparently had a short memory because it soon treated all non-Hebrews like second-class citizens at best; at worst, it treated the like they were treated in Europe (minus the Holocaust but some might argue that). It's like beating a dog to within a inch of its life when it only wanted to play then repeating this process every time the poor dog comes near you, even though you make the moves towards it, then act surprised when it tries to defend itself and lashes out at you; which only fuels your logic for beating the dog even more while denying it full medical care, proper shelter, food, and still treating it like shit when it is trying to behave. What is worse, this is not a dog that is being beaten but a human just like the beater Israel (remember, we're talking metaphors here, stay with me). Never mind that Palestine was assured to its people (by a U.N. or U.K. resolution, I forget which) and then suddenly Israel shows up as the new landlord and starting acting like a dick to the Palestinians. Okay, so it was not cool that the neighbors didn't like this and took their gripes a little too far in making all out war on the new state; that was not cool. The various parties proceeded bitch slapped each other all over the map over the following years and have done more to match the death totals of World War Two than to emulate a world based on Yellow Submarine.

Still, all that is in the past but it does bring up to the present. Resentment runs deep but its time that Israel, in the best position its been in a while (if ever), seem to be in the position to be the grown up here and taking all the tantrums its neighbors are throwing (we're talking the suicide bombings and attacks, not the valid cries for justice and a independent Palestinian state). Yet it acts like the spoiled brat (of the U.N. and U.S) that it has become. It find justifications in the slaughter of thousands of poverty-stricken, isolated, and manipulated (on all sides) civilians to make sure its children can go to school safely. Sure, they use the point the Hamas (and other militant and hostile groups in general) uses human shields to protect themselves (some by choice, others not so much) and that striking them (as the Israelis are now) regardless of the civilian collateral is the only way to solve things. True, Hamas and other groups have not been easy to work with and some only shoot themselves in the foot; still, when is it right for the 600lbs gorilla to torture the kitten who just happens to be clawing at its skin semi-constantly after its tail was stepped on for not staying the corner it was placed in because it was hungry and wanted the nearby food?

Israel need to put on its big-girl panties and stop with this childish bullshit! It is clear they view the Palestinians as the bastard red-headed step-child of the region and wants nothing to do with them and certainly does not want them in their country (with how they go on about Israel being a Jewish state, you'd think it was like all the other countries who are committing genocide and harassing local populations to make true 'nation states'). You would think they might remember the six million Jews slaughter at the hands of Europeans (yes, there were more than just Nazi and German bastards doing it...) and doing something right by their memory, but alas, it seems all for not. The only thing sadder than the revenge Israel seem to be inflicting on anyone it does not like in t he region (play the numbers game with the Holocaust verses Israel's death count and it starts to look a bit more understandable... about two decades ago) is that more fault lies with the Allies, Europe in particular, and the United Nations, none of which seems to want to accept any accountability for the current situation (denialism at its best!). They even sit then time and again and does nothing of value, substance, or resolve as Israel makes war crimes into a spot and often do even less than what they otherwise already do (not do) to other countries (like in Africa, Asia, the Americas).

It would be better for Israel just to admit it wants Palestine and its displayed people out of the region. It would be better that they just create a new holocaust and end the suffering of the people for whom they making suffering a national pass time. It would be better that the U.N. be devolve as it would free up resources (both financial and human) and at least bring back a measure of respect to the otherwise current members who would be that much less hypocritical in their world stances (especially towards the Middle East and Israel and Palestine). It would be better that humanity stop acting like children waiting for their parents to break up the fights and send the ""bad child"" to his room with no supper after a good spanking while the ""good child"" gets milk and cookies while sitting in mama's lap (anyone read the book of Revelations lately?). It would be better that the neighbors of Israel get the sticks out of their ass (while Israel itself did the same) and worked out their differences like civilized mature adults. It would be better that the world stopped for a second and not only condemned the actions both sides in this conflict are doing and put real pressure on both to end the fighting (including political, economic, and military) nd slap both before forcing them to a table and locking the door until either they killed each other or learned to tolerate each other like most of us learned back in second grade (at least that's what was supposed to have been learned by then).

Seriously, it's like watching two children fighting while crying for their mothers..."

"event","The good thing about no one reading something public is you can not worry so much when you mess up. Then, if people start paying attention and dive into the archives, you can claim that such was old and in the past. Well, a perfect example of this was my last post about Brights and Twilight. I guess I don't do enough on this site to bolster my readers but then again, I shouldn't have to. I have enough already through the site I do take time to keep more up-to-date, but that only works if they are enough to read and check out what you post; and it is clear such is very hard to get done even there. I must conclude I am not an interesting-enough person. That and what I produce is not appealing in the markets that I offer them. Shooting myself in the shoot is my lack of really wanting to move anywhere else, as they would likely require me to read more stuff, which I simply don't have time for or an interest to really do (to that extend). Thus, the same issues that keep me as a relative unknown at a site I've been at since 2002 are found inside myself. Ironic?

Okay, back to the topic at hand: Twilight. I was thinking about my previous babble and concluded that I was going about it all wrong. The big issue concerning non-religious, humanists, secularists, skeptics, etc. is that they are so diverse. While the same can be said of religious/spiritual groups, they usually have some common ground that brings them together. While the group I associate with does, too, we have far less of it. I think this is because part of our identity is to be free from ""convention"" and a herd mentality. Thus, we try to distinguish ourselves from other groupings and often take this to an unnecessary extreme. The big issue with how I originally described twilight is I was trying to be too inclusive and a bit overly nice. Hey, believe it or not, that is who I am. So, let's try this Twilight world view one more time...

To say one is bright, whether in the knowledge of science of the faith of religious belief, is arrogant and unrepresentative of the reality of this world. In the darkness is night. Night has its places in our physical world, but in the world of knowledge and understanding, it is transgressive and antiquated. In the darkness, we rely upon false notions of safety and security to guide our lives and we use the night to hide our faults or to not see the mis-actions of others. This night is where we have been as a society for most of our existence. However, in due time we have made candles, torches, flashlights, artificial indoor and outdoor public and private lighting; all help us to illuminate our world. These lights, however, can be manipulated and distorted, causing our ability to understand our reality to falter. We strive to see the world for what is truly is, but are forced largely to do this based on the understandings of others. Something must change in order for this darkness to pass on into memory.

Night where we live is perpetual. We life on a knowledge planet that only rotates as we expand our minds and comprehensions of the reality around us. While the lights we have constructed have helped us better know the world, they have also lead us astray. These lights are symbolic of the people and social constructs that we humans use to interact with each other. From religions to nations to families to great philosophers and scientists, all have tried their best to explain the wonderful reality we live in. In order to each the full light of the day, we must progress towards the dawn and its morning. This can only happen if more individuals strive to better understand the world for themselves rather than relying upon others, even if those people are knowledgeable and do much to truly better our understanding of reality. It is this trend towards ""self-enlightenment"" that has brought us closer towards the dawn.

In this world, the skies are beginning to turn black to dark blue. We are currently in a realm of twilight. No longer can our night vision of the world suffice and the artificial lights we once use are growing more dim in the face of the coming sun (or whatever star is ""rising""). Many of the old lights (religion) have been discarded or are not so often used and with more seeking the truth for themselves, the lights of experts is no longer sufficient to see the world around us. Specifically, we are now entering the world of nautical twilight, where our ability to see is at its most vulnerable. While we race ever close to the large sphere in the sky what will bright our world into sharper focus, we are still far from being in a knowledgeable state of ""safety"". Here, tricksters and shams mix with the old guard of our past knowledge as all bid to lead us through this confusing time.

Many wish to return to the darkness, to things we ""know"" and feel comfortable with. Others want to finish the journey towards the great light and see all there is to see. Still others wish to take advantage of the confusion for their own personal gain. Many are claiming to know the answers and calling on others to follow their path. Some fear the light, others embrace it. Still, most fail to see the danger we are in. This nautical twilight is where we are in our quest to understand the world and increase our knowledge. While many aspects of this reality are well known, there is still o much to discovers, learn, and explore that we may often lose sights on the dangers we face from pseudo-science and misappropriation of knowledge, among many others. Those who acknowledge this twilight can see enough to realize the danger humanity in general faces as it strives to become one giant planetary village where the individual is increasing becoming ever more important. They can also see that returning to he night and its darkness is not an option but that the goal of sunrise is still ever so far off.

We are all people of the twilight in this modern age. Those who see it and strive to keep us on the path to the rising sun do not take a special name or title. They merely do their best to keep the path towards the dawn. here re many for whom this goal is paramount. From Brights and Humanists to Buddhists and Unitarians, all strive for this true knowledge, if such even exists. It is the unifying nature of Twilight that compels all those who seek the light of critical thinking, reason, and logic to strive towards the greater good of helping their fellow human reach a more 'enlightened' frame of mind. Through this effort, the dawn will grow ever brighter until the darkness of the past will be but a topic of historical debate. Until then, the wading through blinding conditions will remain ever treacherous; vigilance for all those who caught within this twilight of knowledge is key to reaching the dawning of the enlightenment of humanity to the realities of the universe."

"event","Agent-Elrond compelled me to this idea; well, I cannot blame her directly. In fact, her use of a specific term was just the catalyst for another idea of mine. I think I have good ideas, or concept that others might at least read and than take up as discussion, even if it is to bolster their claims and beliefs by belittling mine. For now, few listen to me or take anything I say to heart; maybe this is what draws me to do such things. I have never liked label, but we all use them to help define who we are. In an effort to help the re-branding of Skepticism/free-thought/critical thinking/ etc., the term ""Brights"" was 'coined'. It seems rather silly but the term embodied nicely the point people who use it are trying to make. A metaphor on multiple levels, Brights I think do a lot to better this world and at least live up to their namesake in certain areas. Here's what Wikipedia has to say:

<i>The Brights movement is a social movement that aims to promote public understanding and acknowledgment of the naturalistic world view. It was co-founded by Paul Geisert and Mynga Futrell in 2003. The noun 'bright' was coined by Geisert as a positive-sounding umbrella term, and Futrell defined it as ""an individual whose worldview is naturalistic (free from supernatural and mystical elements)"".

This created the basis for a civic constituency to pursue the movement's three major aims:

   1. Promote public understanding and acknowledgment of the naturalistic worldview, which is free of supernatural and mystical elements.
   2. Gain public recognition that persons who hold such a worldview can bring principled actions to bear on matters of civic importance.
   3. Educate society toward accepting the full and equitable civic participation of all such people.

The brights movement has been formed as an Internet constituency of individuals. Its hub is The Brights' Net website, but each individual has autonomy to speak for him/herself. The Brights' Net's tagline is now: ""Illuminating and Elevating the Naturalistic Worldview"".</i>
-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brights_movement"">Brights Movement, Wikipedia</a>

Now, for those paying attention or who know me well enough, it's obvious I have something critique here. I do, but I also want to make clear that I do otherwise support the end goals of what the Brights strive for. As someone who aligns himself with the secularists, humanists, skeptics, etc. the goals thereof I highly respect and hope to further myself. Where I draw my criticism against the Brights is their name. Seriously, besides sounding a bit lame and an obvious attempt to make themselves sound superior in some way to their rivals/opponents, the movement seems more a fracturing of the overall pro-science, pro-logic movement. It would seem in our own ways, we all need to belong to sub-groups of sub-groups. Noting being human is enough. We are drawn into smaller and smaller sects in order to make ourselves feel more secure and allow us to make more general assumptions about those we commune with and those who scrap with. Yeah, it's part of human nature and a part of how we interact with everyone and everything we encounter. Still, it's all rather silly. Now, I am not to make this criticism nor have I tried to re-brand this who ideal. First, I thought the term ""Dim"" might work to better the idea I am about to present; but that is a bit too demeaning. Crepuscular is more towards what I am going for but it does not roll off the tongue. Well, first, let's start out by examining what the title of the journal is all about.

Many see the world in black and white, or day and night. From the perspective most non-religious hold, night is the realm of faith and belief and the day the world of logic and reason. Obvious, those of a religious nature see just the opposite. Of course, while the core of each side of the coin would in some way scorn the middle ground, I say there is a midpoint between the darkness and light that is neither exclusively spiritual nor natural. There is a twilight where all knowledge resides. For those who chose to dwell in the night (regardless of who you think is in the dark), they often neglect certain senses in favor of others and praise how they interpret the world; above all they tout how much they don't need their sight to understand and comprehend their world. For those in the day, they do much the same towards their vision and question how anyone could not live without it. Sadly, both are rather blind, either from too much light or lack thereof. No matter where you go, many seem to gravitate towards these ideals in face of the world in which most reside. In this world, what is reality and fantasy is often hard to discern. Even if one can filter out the B.S. there is much to misinterpret, even with the best methods and intentions.

I call this realm of ""true(r) reality"" Twilight. For anyone who has experienced twilight, it is a surreal world where all your senses are required to get around and even then, you often will trip up on something. Obviously, this example is flawed in that we humans are (normally) very much a visual creature. One can argue that we have the worst vision during twilight, as our day and night visions work best in those situations. I argue, however, that the world we live in is more a twilight than a night or day in regard to deciphering and understand all the information and knowledge readily available and newly uncovered. In this world, we cannot always be sure about a lot of things and must rely not only upon all our senses, which in such an environment will often fail us, and those around us. To be in either extreme of day or night is to blind one's self needlessly. While one may think they see clearer, the ego in these environments can grew with ease, which always causes problems. To live in a twilight world means you are always aware of your shortcomings and are constantly striving to improve yourself. This may build confidence but the continual stumbling will keep an ego in check. Twilight is less of an idea to strive for but more of an acknowledgment of the faults one has and the world one resides in. That, while a horrid explanation of the concept, does encompass the idea. So, now we have to chose a name for those who ""Live in Twilight"".

Again, the scientific name for such creatures (crepuscular) is just not a title that will roll off the tongue or get you chicks; neither will dim. Still, I would rather we stop with the dumb labeling system all together but until that day comes, what should this label be? Well, it is clear my definition of 'twilight' is more Nautical Twilight than anything. Hmm, maybe we could not have a fancy title and just call ourselves ""People of Twilight"". Who knows? Maybe my idea doesn't make any sense at all. All I do know is I live in a world of twilight, and so does everyone else... and I babble too much."

"event","<div align=""justify"">Christians bitch that Christmas has become to secular. People have obviously list the true/original meaning of the holiday; the reason for the season, as it were: baby Jesus and all that stuff. True, the commercialization of the holidays makes many of us wish for its quick execution by the time the first of December comes around, but it is clear many (if not most) Christians forget that they stole what would become Christmas today from the pagans. Ever hear of Yule and the other various Winter festivals that usually centered around the winter soloist? There are much more things to celebrate this time of year than the supposed birth of carpenter's son whose real birthday is likely in mid-Spring. Hanukkah can make a better pass for being celebrated around this time of year than Kwanzaa, which doesn't make much sense to anyone (even Kwanzaa-bot!). Both of these the average Christians would likely look down upon; like they have sole right to the season... sure, some of their gripes are legit, but their reasoning behind their banter is no more selfish and self-righteous than at any other time of the year.

Atheists, Humanists, and other non-religious folk seem to complain that you cannot escape Christmas. Everywhere you go, there it is! You are also expected to celebrate it in some way; if you don't, you are ostracized as a Grinch, Scrooge, or worse and in some cases for to participate anyway. Most non-Judaic religious faiths and the like agree that the pressure and overwhelming nature of the Christmas season is very degrading to those who do not wish to join in the festivities. Again, the total commercialization of the holiday is not helping here and with most of America (and many other Western countries) in on the National event, it would be unavoidable even if not the time of year when many businesses finally start to make a profit. Still, that's what you get for living in a Christian-majority country. Most of the season no longer revolves around a manger but bells, and cash registers and the almighty dollar. There a plenty of other reason to celebrate the season, including selfless work to help needy people, being nice to your fellow humans for once, a reason to be happy in a dark and dreary part of the year.

Ironic, it is, that Christians bitch that Christmas is too secular and other religions and the non-religious complain that it is too religious. Just like with most things in the war between religion (any) and secularism (non-religion), both sides see the other's influence and cry foul. While each has legitimate points of concern, they always seem to make it like some horrid thing that is gong to destroy the fabric of our society... yet every year, here we remain. Yeah, it would be nice not to be subjected to the music and commercials and the holiday cheer everywhere you turn, and it would be nice if for once in its existence humanity would finally grow up so there would be peace on earth, good will towards men/women/etc.; it would also be nice if we could care more about each other the rest of the year and perhaps even more so during this time rather they speaking this feel-good mantra while otherwise cursing the idiot in front of us (however much they deserve it) and priding ourselves for swiping the last must-have item and reveling in the tears and muddled curses of those who came too late.

The holidays as we know them today are but a product of our own creation. We built this mixed bag of nuts regardless of our own intents and further it with our actions each year. No matter how you perceive reality or your opinion on the Christmas season, you -all- and responsible for it. All the good and bad aspect of humanity come out in full force this time of year and whether you bow to God or Allah or Shiva or reject all of their existences and advocate the annulment of the entire fiasco (gods included), and all points in between, we as a species are the enemy we fight to make this time of year what we want; and just like every year that has come before this, we fail. We fail because we forgot ourselves, we fail because we are blind to what the solution to all our problems is, we fail because we cannot see beyond our own self-interests as individuals and member of our various blocs and groups. Everyone wants what they see as the best way to celebrate the season or not. How very selfish. What this season should symbolize is what is lacking throughout the rest of the year; and that should be retained throughout the rest of the year regardless.

As an Agnostic, I enjoy the secular Christmas season but find the commercialized overwhelming presence of the holiday to be enough to drive a man to drink... more often than he already does. I see the beauty of the spiritual/religious aspects and for those who need it, that is fine by me. Those who don't want anything to do with the season, I've been there myself. For America, and I might go further to say any country, we live in a world where you cannot just sit idly by in your own little click and forget that others exists or that these others should bow down to how you view the world. Majority rules in a democracy, but that does not mean the majority is always right or should abandon the minority. Yes, there are many places where this ideology does not apply. Good for them. To me, I celebrate this season in my own way and detail with the part that I cannot honestly change. Yes, this does make me accountable for trying to make things ""better"", but who am I to make that call? Who are any of us? I merely strive to my this time of year a enjoyable one for myself and those I chose to care about; everyone should at least do that; remembering, of course, that we should only extend an invitation to other to join in our ways and move on if they decide otherwise.

Christmas is what you make of it... or not. So stop bitching and start doing! Just don't make an ass out of yourself in the process! In closing: Merry Fucking Christmas, ya filthy animals; and a Happy Bloody New Year!</div>

"event","You've seen them on buses and on TV, then you saw them on billboards! Just when you think that was enough, now they're doing it during the Christmas season! Spreading a simple message to connect with their fellow brethren during a time they feel increasingly isolated in due to the crisp holiday spirit and torrent of shoppers flooding the streets of downtown with the Santa caps and reindeer headband, these people want their voice to be heard through the din of Crosby and bells. Is that so much to ask? Well, I don't think so. No, I'm not talking about Christians who bitch and moan about how the holiday has becomes so secularized it has become meaningless. I refer to the Atheists. Apparently, those infamous advertisements that question God (or any deity by proxy) are popping up once again in America's heartland. After hearing the comments from episode 139 of the 2 Sense show, and particularly after Jibba's comments, I have to speak up. These boards are no more inflammatory or insulting than any of the God-related ones and in fact are more polite and non-demeaning; okay, so at least the one I'm talking about it.

The board reads something to the effect of: 'Don't believe in God? You're not alone.' Certainly more benign than those black advertisements damning you to hell or giving you the sense of the Almighty big brother watching you masturbate and curse during rush hour. This board merely says that there is a community out there with a certain views/take on reality that wants to meet others like it. Jibba apparently took exception to this, arguing that it was inappropriate because it would (by default) make any Christian (or anyone who believe in a religion or faith) question their faith. This makes no sense. If you are so easy sways to question your religion, then you are likely more in tune with yourself than most. Now, two things can become of this: either you reject the notion because you are satisfied with how the world operates in your mind or you add it to your least of reasons to rethink your point of view; and if it happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back, then so be it. Under this logic, all advertisements of any kind should be banned as each tries in their own way to convert the public not interested in their product to have a change of heart. To focus this example, at least all the religious/spiritual/faith based billboards should be taken down for the same reason. Questioning one's world views is healthy, even if you conclude your take on reality is correct; and considering this ploy to connect with others of like mind who may not know of such a movement is protected under several of our (USA) laws, such an argument is a mute point anyway.

Now drink your eggnog, dawn your Santa hat, and let's paint the town red and green!"

"event","It took over a year, but I was finally pulled over by a WaSP yesterday (11/22): Washington State Patrol. The lady, in a white unmarked SUV, was nice and assured me it was just a paperwork check (no violations) and asked where the fire extinguisher/emergency triangles were; and after about ten minutes I was back on the road with inspection in hand. This was during work, mind you. I drive a large delivery-type truck for my Data Currier gig and such is part of the territory; though hopefully not frequently. This was on I-90 at the bottom of the hill East-bound before the SR-18 exit. Time was about 1145-1200.

"event","People keep asking if Obama's win puts the racial past of America behind it. Well, it is truly was the past, that is, no body cared or brought the matter up, then it would be. So by asking the question in the here and now, it answers itself. Only after considering this election from a historical context (i.e. not now or in the near future) will such a ""line in the sand"" be determined. However, there is one fairly obvious example people overlook to determine when we as a country and a society are at least on the right track, if not truly past racial issues:

When a white man can say ""nigger"", even in a derogatory fashion to a African-American, and no body cares..."

Well, I have a <a href=""http://osyrisdiamond.blogspot.com/"">writing blog</a>, Curtis T. has his <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/curtistraccoon"">myspace</a> and its blog, and then I have my <a href=""http://osyris.deviantart.com/"">deviantart account</a> and its journal. However, each is either specialized or takes a while and meant for a specific audience. Here, I can post at random and say the things I wanna say. Still waiting for a co-host with a mic and some time to start up my podcast idea, which still needs a name. It will be much lolz. I need to start pimping this things again. I got the link of this to my writing blog. Will need to update dA to include this again... wish a lot of these sites had multiple site links for ""personal"" page. So, why did I choose the name of this lj ask I did? Something different. Honestly, I thought it sounded cool and it's kinda true. No god(s) for me, plz. Kthxbai! Posted a couple things on dA to make people think; God hates me more now, I think. Had a interesting conversation with Andrew the security guard. McCain's speech and Obama's the night of the election. It went down something like this:

<i>McCain: Obama won: all hails new Negro Overlord!

McCain: Hey! No killing da Overlord!
Crowd Mc: ...

Crowd Mc: Towel Head must die! Linch da niggrah!
McCain: Epic Fail: Zip it!
Obama: Much lol.
McCain: Hey, Overlord? We all good, yeah?
Obama: Hope and future ish good! Monies!
McCain: Past behind us? McCain be good nigger for master.

Even if you think things are rigged, even if you don't like the candidates (there are more than two, ya know!), even if you think the energy elite run the planet, VOTE!

There are a lot of big issues, too, on the ballets like doctor prescribed drugs to hasten death for terminally ill patients (Initiative 1000) in Washington state or the anti-gay marriage bill (Prop 8) in California. Vote for the good of the country, not yourself. Vote based not on the enforcement of your religious beliefs on others but on what will benefit the most Americans. Freedom from and of religion, that is a key part of every election. Human rights and dignity are also in the balance. Show the rest of the world that the ""leading"" democracy is actually worthy of the title. Remember: vote early, vote often; that is, don't put it off and do it consistently. (Sorry, mayor Daily.)

I don't want to work tonight, nor do I want to work next Saturday. Need to buy Dutchie's gift and need to give Kat and Jon's respected gifts. Need to find inspiration for my poems. Hope whatever Jon gives me for my music will help me get going on my grand idea. I need to get Holly a birthday gift but will be unable to until my first paycheck of the new year. Once that is done, I will finally be able to get focus back on my car and music. I think I will focus on minor things for my car until it is paid off. Currently, I must get back into the groove of saving up the lump sum to help pay off the car early. I will get the new bezel and taillight...then I have a problem. Because of what I want to do next, I do not have anything beyond that to do, which seems like a waste of time. But I can't do much of anything until Roxanne is paid in full. I'll focus on my music until then. Lots to do, the time of my dreams are soon at hand.

Dad got a $1.02. Holly will most likely keep her job. I got my raise. Mom will get a raise with the new year. Grandparents have a new home and have no more outstanding debt. Presents wrap around the Christmas tree. This year is the best we've had since we moved from Coronado. Life is good."

"event","Must I give solid proof of what I believe in before someone will accept my views as a valid option? Most of what we believe in based on theory, a idea which has too many unanswered questions to be a fact and/or truth. Yet, more people are willing to believe these unproven ideals before they will put faith in a god. There is about the same amount of evidence for both...and an equal amount against each. For all the some of my friends respect me and my faith, I don't think any of the take me seriously. I'm not the shining example of what a true Christian should be but I try. Jon said once that I was the most level headed (or liberal, whichever) Christian he'd met. But he always points out the flaws in my faith. I don't care what you think or how you view me, just show some respect and learn that sometimes it's better not to say things. I've had to learn that, too. Why must they use my own lack of knowledge to try and prove their point. Just because I don't have all the answers does not make my point any less valid. 

It's interesting that it's those who do have the love of their parents are just as likely to end up killing people as those who did not. ""I did not think he could do it."" and ""I never noticed him much."" These phrases are said of those who came from loving homes and still went 'mad'. Those who use the excuse that daddy wasn't there and people pick on me are just hiding from reality. I was picked on, I was the least liked kid in school; but I don't let it effect my life in that way. My parents weren't always what I'd want them to be but I love them just the same. The point is that you choose where your life goes and how things turn out. Take responsibility and make something of your life. The world be damned, who cares about them? You do, because you keep bitching about them. If they do not matter, the stop blaming them for your current status.

Santa Russell worked out well. Everyone was happy with what they got. Adam gave me his present, and it is truly wonderful. Got mom's and dad's presents tonight. Just need Kat's and Dutchie's. Also got a kool mixed CD from Adam's mom. Ate out with JP and his father yesterday. Had a big religious/philosophical/social discussion with a bunch of friends. My skills in Halo 2 on-line are improving. I need to do more story work on GTA:SA. I don't want to work this weekend...or the next. But I do what I must. No new poems or any progress on my story. Jon said he would help me get some software to get me started on my music...that should make me happy, so why am I still so sad?"

"event","Well, my work with the presents is almost done. All I need to get now is Kim her present and JP something more than what I already have for him. Santa Russell may still work. I have the hat, I just need the sack. Saturday & Sunday will be a bitch. I will have to buy Kim's gift that day. I don't want to get her candles but I'm not totally sure if I got the two series she wants for her DVD collection. I think I know what Derek told me when I wrote it down but I was in the middle of sleeping. Here's what I wrote on the paper: ""NaaIica DVD 2"", ""Pbxhnlytb & Rexhnlybe DVD 3"". The first should be Nadesico and the second...I think it's RahXephon. This is why you never call me when I'm sleeping. JP on the other hand, now that his shipment was canceled, I don't know. He has one small item but I want to get him something more. Lots to do still. We got a Nobel Spruce from this tree farm in Covington. We cut it down ourselves. They charged by type, not size. $40.00 for this 6'4"" beautiful tree. Love the smell. Star and Spangle were all big-eyed. My pants were all muddy and wet. I kinda feel bad for cutting it down though. I just don't want bad tree karma, I guess. We'll put decorations on it later this week. We got the first set of Christmas lights up on our house but all this high winds and stuff have been blowing them down and all over. Hopefully things will settle down so we can use them.

Poeted a poem on DeviantART. Been slow with them. Been gaining more watchers and friends. Currently, I have 78 watchers. I need to make a new profile. I want to visit Australia. I have so many friends over there and it's a place I've wanted to explore for a very long time. Well, I can dream for the moment. If my music lends me the money to do so, it will be on hell of an adventure. It seems ButtercupSaiyan and Neverm0reX have parted ways. Honestly, I'm not too surprised. She still wants me to do the music, for which I am very happy. I will start on getting everything I need once the holidays are over. My car will sadly have to wait. I've been talking some friends at work and I really give up; I don't know what to do outside of getting a new car. Neither of them like my car, it's an automatic and there is no clear-cut answer I can find. I would like to make my final decision based on something more concrete. No matter, Roxanne will rule any automatic out there and most ricers, too. That reminds me, on Saturday, Mom and Holly show up asking me what I wanted for Christmas...and for the first time in my life, I had no answer. Most things that I want are too expensive for others to buy and usually too specific. Plus, I budget for them and I like doing it on my own. (though any help is nice) Besides that, most small things I get on my own anyway. I've become very selfrelient in that respect. I found it so hard to give them idea's so I hope the did ok. Well, Holly will make sure of that...though I'm not sure if I should be happy about that. J/K!

Speaking of Holly, I'm starting to get really annoyed with how things are turning out for her. She does her best, shows so much promise and yet time after time she keeps getting the short end of the stick because some dumb-ass decided they felt threatened by her. Which they should, in a way; she's the most self-confident women I know and has great leadership potential. How can she grow in this world when all she ever gets is shit? Well, I can only sit on the sidelines and watch...prehaps even give some advice now and again. I only hope see keeps at it, for that is the only way she'll survive. But of both of these, I am relativity sure of.

Umm, this weekend will be up in the air as usual. Will try to get the rest of the presents taken care of.

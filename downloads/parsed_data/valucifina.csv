So i didnt move to florida obviously.  approximately 75% percent of me regrets the decision to not go but as it turns out there are better reasons to stay than to leave.  A lot more than I thought.  So its not like Im NEVER leaving.  Im just not leaving yet.

One very important reason to stay:

Adam.

I completely didn't see him coming.  He is amazing.  I've never been with anyone who treats me so well or cares about me so much.  Lets just hope I don't fuck it up.

Im still working at good old JHBH or as I like to call it, Hell.  Im now attending StonyBrook university even though i said i never would.  I have approximately 2 years left till i graduate if i hustle which i probably wont because lets face it, im not really the hustling type.

My dog Shaka died in july and i miss her so much.

There are 6 more weeks until I turn 21.  I was 16 when i started this journal.  Its weird to look back and see how different things are now.  Nevertheless I can't wait to finally be of legal age to drink.  I never really had a fake ID so i am sooo freakin excited to finally be able to order a drink without worrying.  

I dunno.  Not really much else to say."

Supa-fast life update:

CJ and I are over and I don't want to talk about it.
2 Days later I was already kissing someone else and have been ever since.
His name is Adam and he's awesome.
Im leaving for Florida definitely in 4 months.
I don't know how I feel about anything. excited, sad, scared, hopeful. whatever 

Im pissed because im the last of my friends to turn 21 and i still have 5 more months to go.

I was walking out of walbaums the other day after picking up a card for my mommy when a car full of 16 year old boys drove by me and proceeded to yell  ""KNOCKERS"" out the window in my direction.  Now, mind you i was wearing my work uniform which is not revealing in any way shape or form.  It was so loud and sudden that i actually jumped backwards in surprise. I looked back at them driving away and they were all peeing themselves with laughter.  I guess if i were them i'd laugh at me too. christ.  I hate adolesent boys."

"event","Jocelyn told me last night that i have a really important decision to make and she's absolutly right.  Unfortunatly for her she didn't realize that i am the most indecisive human being on the planet.  So there goes that idea.
I am technically unemployed this week because i stopped working at harvards last weekend, and my new job doesnt start until monday.  Coincidentaly neither does school.  So basically i am a lazy bum this week and its starting to drive my slightly more insane than i already was.
Lauren turned 21 yesterday.  I remember when i was at her 6th birthday party.  This makes me feel super old.  
I use the word super too much in my everyday vocabulary.
I dreamt last night that i was going to the prom with Blake and our transportation was a giant pink platform shoe.  
I also dreamt that sarah huda called me and told me she was pregnant.  She's not though in real life, so don't worry.
I was driving the other night and that billy joel song She's got a way came on.  Chris Mitro always plays that on the piano and i basically melt everytime.  Sometimes I wish he just lived here all year round, my life would be a lot easier.  He's awesome, and sometimes i really miss him.

merlinZBT (12:00:48 AM): more than u know

So what do you know, Brandon Dennis Mannix actually has feelings.  Who would have thought.


My arms feel like jello.  Maybe i should start working out again.  Although when i did work out everyday i didnt feel like i was getting any less jello-y.  Maybe if i did it for more than a month i would actually see some results.  I feel pale today.  and fat...very very fat.  i hate winter.  Snow always makes my self esteem diminish like 65%.  Its just so cold and wet and uncomfortable.  I hate it.  I must move to florida immediatly.  In other news me angela jocelyn and helen booked our trip to cancun today!  June 16th to the 23rd, im so fucking excited.  When i told CJ about it he asked if I was going to come back with any mexican std's.  He was completely joking but i detected a slight amount of actual concern in his voice that i might be going to hook up with other boys, which made me happy because he almost never seems jealous.  I could be wrong though.  
Not much else to say.  It's bedtime i guess.  I've been having really crazy dreams lately every time i go to sleep.  My brain is going insane i think.  but what else is new."

"event","Reading my old journals seriously depresses me.   I just talk about the same shit over and over again.  I need some new excitment in my life.  I need to stop obsessing over the same idiot boys, i mean what am i, in 10th grade?  
I just dont know anymore.  I still cannot figure out why i am the way i am all the time.  Why im not better at pretending like everybody else.  Or even why i have to pretend so much. 
I can't finish anything i start.
I can't make any final decisions.
I can't get certain thoughts out of my head.
I can't get certain people out of my life.
Everything just always ends up the same way no matter how different the circumstances start off.  Im terrified about leaving John Harvards because its the only thing i've known since highschool.  But i also know that its come to the point that i don't have any other choice but to leave. I also know that i probably am the one to blame for making it that bad for myself.  

Things i've learned from working at john harvards:

-2 out of 3 people who go out to eat insist on sitting in a booth as opposed to a regular table.
-All beers have different color, body and flavor, they are not all the same as i previously believed.
-Pesto olive oil does not come out in the washing machine when spilled on khakis
-Dating 3 boys at once who all work in the same building with you may seem fun at first, but in the end it will turn out bad...very very bad. Horrible in fact. awful. 
-The shittiest tippers tend to be the ones who don't speak english.
-It's called LAVASH not matza.
-Everybody in the universe smokes pot, even the people your positive do not.
-Highschool bullshit does not end at graduation
-Old women LOVE pot pie
-Most people age 18-27 still don't know what the fuck they want to do with their lives either so i shouldn't feel so bad.
-Scrod looks exactly the way it sounds.
-Breaking up is way worse when you have to work together the next day.
-hooking up with someone is way more awkward then you have to work together the next day.
-making friends with the line cooks is a good idea because they will make you free food.
-making friends with the line cooks is a bad idea because they will molest you ever chance they get.
-managers make less money than servers, and thats why they are so bitter sometimes.
-Sex in the basement of the restaurant is frowned upon but will not get you fired.
-co workers who seem like they are your good friends will come and go.  The people who were your friends before the stupid job are the ones that will always be there for you.
-never eat the soup of the moment....it usually consists of three day old broccoli and tastes like monkeys.

Im a completely different person than i was the first day i walked through the door at john harvards in august of 2002.  I don't know why that stupid building effected me so much.  I guess a lot of good things came out of the whole experience along with the bad shit.  I met some pretty amazing people.  I had some pretty amazing times.  I did a lot of things that i've never done before.  Im not gonna say i have no regrets because i have hundreds of them.  But working there is not one of them.

Now its time again for me to move on and start over.  Im leaving with the same people in my life that i started with and that makes me happy.  Im leaving a few people behind that i wish i never met to begin with.  Im sad but at the same time im so happy to get the fuck out.  

This time next year i will be in florida.
This time next year i will be happier.
This time next year i will get my shit together.

But as for right now...time to start my new job.  Time to finish up Dowling so i can transfer to Lynn.  Time to forget about all the bullshit in the past and focus on the future.

Time to go make a sandwich cause im freakin starvin."

So lets talk about my new years eve...It was fucking amazing.  Went to CJ's friend Mike's house.  Saw all my favorite patchogue medford kids.  Got completely bombed out of my mind.  Had an awesome time.  Kissed CJ at midnight....<small>banged CJ till 6am</small>. Got some inside info about him from his florida roomate.  Apparently he talks about me all the time down there and thinks im the best girl he's ever met :).  Don't really know exactly whats gonna happen with this whole situation, but its definitely worth sticking around for.  Im slightly in love.
So now im off to the country corner to celebrate jocelyn's birthday.  I know i definitely wont be drinking tonight, im far too hungover from last night.  I think even the smell of alcohol might make me puke.  

so ummm...yeah.  thats all."

"event","My great uncle Izzy died today.  Yes, I have an uncle Izzy.  Or should I say had.  I never seem to react normally when people i know die.  He lived in Florida and I only saw him maybe once a year.  I haven't seen him in at least 2 or 3 though.  I remember that he was extremely funny and reminded me of Joe Pesci.  I wish I was closer to my mother's side of the family.  

Im restless as usual.  Im confused as usual.  Im overwhelmed as usual yet not as concerned as I should be about being overwhelmed.  I have 2 papers due monday that I have yet to write.  I have to study for 4 finals in a row...mon, tues, wed, thurs.  I wish today was next friday when all this shit is over.  I still have to write my essay for my Lynn University application and send it out.  I have a bunch of bills due next week and not enough money to pay them. I still have not gone Christmas shopping.  So basically im fucked until this week is over.  

As for the boy situation i hate them.  Why must they be so damn confusing.  All i want is for him to be upfront and honest and not a complete retard.  Is that so much to ask?  This is day one of his last chance.  We'll see how this month goes.  I think i've done a pretty awesome job of proving myself to him, it's his turn to prove himself to me.  I hope it works out.  He is too god damn wonderful to lose. 

Pugs and I are back on speaking terms so thats good.  He actually called which is something i didnt think he would do.  Maybe we can be best friends again because i love him and miss him more than words can describe.

ok....must....write...papers."

No more lies.  
It's time to say whats on my mind.  
I Can hardly breath.  
I can hardly speak.  
How am I going to say these things.  
You're just out of reach.  
Like you've always been.  
I always knew in the end you'd win.  
My hopes held high.  
As time went by.  
Why won't you tell me what you feel inside.  
Is honesty too much to ask?  
What happened then is in the past.  
You're not here.  
You never were.  
The day we met.  
You were half out the door.  
So much time wasted and opportunities missed.  
As we tried to recreate that perfect first kiss. 
Im still waiting for that time to come.  
When you tell me Im your only one.  
Lie to me but make it true.  
Tell me I belong to you.  
That you are worth the things I've given up.  
The people I've hurt.  
Other boys I've loved.  
Chances that I've thrown away.  
All to ensure you'd be mine someday.  
The future's one big question mark.

All I want.  
You know the answer.

-Pugs and I are no longer on speaking terms...so basically i lost my best friend and im not gonna lie, im a little devastated but i really dont want to get into it.

-I hate John Harvards and i want to quit, but hey what else is new.

-My father informed me that if i was to move out of my house he would pay my rent SCORE!

-I got my first brazilion wax and it was the most painful yet most worth while experience of my life.

-I just got home tonight from visiting CJ in west palm beach and it was the most amazing weekend ever.

This I will elaborate on:

The weather was beautiful 80 degrees and sunny everyday.  CJ's friends are all awesome.  His apartment is amazing, his school is amazing and basically i want to live there.  I met a really awesome friend of CJ's named Lina who lives in his apartment building and wants me to move in with her and to be completely honest im seriously considering it.  Im applying to PBA as soon as i can just to see if i can get in.  I just really dont want people to think im moving there for the sole purpose that CJ is there.  Yeah, ok...Im not gonna lie its a big perk that he's there but thats not why i want to go there.  I hate it here.  Im hate the atmosphere, the people, the nightlife sucks.  Basically i haven't had any fun here in a long time.  I need a drastic change.  This isn't working for me.
Anyway, more about my trip.  I rode on a motorcycle for the first time and it was siiick.  I made it through 48 minutes of a power hour and im really proud of myself. I attended a ""coming out"" party full of big black lesbians and it was hysterical. Spent some quality time with CJ...and it was amazing.  I guess ill keep him around for a while longer:) It was just awesome.  and now im back here and im pissed.

My heart hurts in such a way that only you can stop it
The beating has slowed down to a sad and lonely pace
Looking in the mirror I barely recognize my own face
Theres a burning in my chest
My skins much colder now
Can't laugh anymore
I've seemed to forgotten how
I go on with my day as if I never met you
Just a vacant spot in my heart 
Something that you never knew
It was always only you
Though I never seemed to show it
You were the only one who was true
But I never let you know it
So I'll continue to be numb
Pretend you don't exist
Smile artificially
Find someone else to kiss
But no matter who or when or why
How much I ignore it 
Or tell myself not to cry
The one thing that I know is;
It was always only you
Though i never seemed to show it
Even though you wish i didn't exist
I just needed you to know it."

Sarah knows how to fix it but she doesn't think its necessary to pick up the phone when i call her anymore, or even call me back for that matter and thats just wonderful.  
Going to work has been like walking into actual hell lately.  The air conditioner is always broken, the customers are trashy and annoying and cheap, I am constantly in the middle of the latest drama no matter what it is or who it involves, and that damn sunglasses at night song is apparently the ONLY song in the universe that ever plays on the radio there.  
Dan has been extremely obnoxious and annoying lately and i want to strangle him.  I feel like he does it to get my attention but as soon as he gets it he goes right back into asshole mode to makes it seem like IM the one trying so hard to get HIS attention.  From now on I am using him for the sole purpose of sex and thats it because he is obviously not mature enough to have a mature conversation let alone relationship.

Does alcohol bring out the truth or does it help you lie better?

This i think is the question of the year.  I know that when i am drunk i say more of what i really think and feel.  I tell people what i really want and i say things that im too afraid to say when im sober.  But maybe some people lie better when they're drunk.  I would really love to know because it would clarify a lot of things.  

It would be really great to know if Im making a fool of myself or not.
It would be really great to know a lot of things.

I wonder if anyone ever misses me the way that I miss them.

I don't even know why I write in this damn thing anymore, no one else does."

"event","The passed few weeks have been somewhat of a rollercoaster.  Sometimes Im up , most of the time im down.  You never know which way my life is going to turn lately.  On the somewhat up side Dan came crawling back.  He confessed that he was just confused and being stupid, and i shouldnt pay attention to what he had said because he didn't know what he wanted or what he was talking about.  Im not sure if he was asking that we go back to what we were or not it was kind of a lot of rambling in between him grabbing my face and kissing me.  I didn't really give him much of an answer either.  I pretty much don't trust him anymore.  Unfortunatly he's great in the sack so i can't quite extinguish this relationship yet.  Im just not done with him.  
Pugs and my friendship is going on a day to day basis at the moment.  I feel like we're not as close as we used to be and we fight constantly.  Losing him would be worse than losing any boyfriend.  I just expect more from him because he has meant way more to me than any boy I have ever dated.  Its making me really nervous that he might be drifting away.
I saw Blake today.  Had a 2 minute pointless conversation.  We parted ways without even saying goodbye.  ::note to self:: Avoid all contact with Blake Kimbro from now on, he is a complete retard and makes my brain hurt.
Its may sound really strange but im starting to really like my parents...including the step ones.  My father especially.  I never realized until now that he would do anything for me and I am so lucky to have him.  He's stuck by me through all my stupid mistakes and never made me feel like a complete dissapointment.  
Im going on a cruise with my brothers my dad and marie in a few weeks.  Im really scared to go not because im afraid of large boats or anything but mostly because last time i went on vacation  i got home and my life went to shit.  I need someone to stay here and guard my life or something to make sure everything stays intact this time.

that is all."

The last words that I say
Right before you nod and look down
Right before I walk away
I'll pretend to forgive you
I'll pretend to forget
I'll pretend that my heart isn't so full of regret
I'll make it seem like your smile
Doesn't make my stomach drop
I'll make believe that your touch
Doesn't make my heart stop
I'll smile like always
Pretend I don't care
I just wish you knew how much Im going to miss
Running my fingers through your hair
The way you looked at me
The way you held my face
It just doesn't make sense
That all those times were just a waste
I'll never understand why you left me standing here
Heartbroken and confused
Drowning in my tears
Maybe one day you'll realize the mistake that you have made
Oh fuck it....I never really liked you that much anyway...
I just wanted to get laid."

The only explanation I was given was that ""The feelings just aren't there"".  He said I didn't seem like I was all that into to it either considering I was dating other boys the entire time, and basically i never actually told him how I felt about him which is true.

This girl.  This sweet sincere nothing but nice to everyone girl felt so hopeless and helpless and so alone that the only way she thought she could make the pain stop was to step in front of a moving train.  The thought of it makes me sick to my stomach.  She didn't even live to see her 21st birthday.  
I think back to every encounter I've ever had with her.  She was so unbelievably good at hiding it, but i should have seen it.  There was saddness behind her smile....and a disease I know all too well.  But i didn't know her well enough...and i wish i could have.  
She didn't think about how many people it would effect when she stepped off that platform.  Im just some random girl she worked with... and my heart is broken.  Her family will never be the same, her friends, everyone the knew her.

"event","Well im back from south beach.  Awesome, awesome times.  A week full of going to the amazingly beautiful beach everyday, walking on the strip, and yes i actually went clubbing more than once, in fact we went out almost everynight which is weird for me cause i hate going to clubs.  Amy's ID worked like a charm so i didn't have to worry about that too much.  I think my favorite part of the trip was when we went jet skiing.  it was fucking awesome.  I let angela drive which was probably a bad idea and i ended up screaming bloody murder the entire time but it was totally worth it.  Met some cute boys the second night we were there.  They said they were 22 but later on we found out they were only 18 and just graduated highschool.  Needless to say this information ended our 2 hour love affair.  Sigh..oh well.  The last 3 days of the trip we were literally the only white girls on the entire strip and i was scared.  We still had a great time, consumed massive amounts of alcohol, and met some pretty interesting characters.  I don't think im as tan as i would have liked to be but i guess i still have the whole summer to work on that.  Im so happy to be home.  This summer is going to be awesome.

"event","Had a really awesome weekend so i felt the need to update since i barely ever do.  Went up to Cortland to see Tony's band open for Sugar Ray.  It was me, Dan, Angela, Ronni, Dave, and Rachael.  We stayed in Dan's sister's dorm room.  The ride up ther wasn't too bad, I slept most of the time.  We of course didn't get on the road until 2 hours after we were supposed to because apparently Dan's alarm didn't go off.  It was freakin hysterical throwing rocks at his window and ronni screaming his name in order for him to wake up,watching him stumble to his window with a really confused look on his face, and then watch as the panic set in.  He's so silly.  So we finally got there 4 hours later and met up with his sister who is absolutely one of the sweetest girls i've ever met. The more time i spend with Dan the more i really like him.  We all wondered around the campus for a little while, the went to the store to pick up some alcohol and juice's so we could make punch later on.  Finally at 5 we went to go see Tony's show which was mediocre at best but all in all entertaining.  in between Tony and Sugar Ray playing there was a 2 hour interval so we left the show for a while and drank lots of 180 proof punch.  We wondered drunkenly some more around cortland and just as i am at my peak of really liking Dan and having an awesome time i get a text message...and guess who it's from.  Its CJ and he's calling to tell me he's home from school.  He has the worst timing ever.  So then all the sudden head is spinning and im wondering what exactly im supposed to do now.  Im looking at Dan and he's so amazing and awesome to be with.  But all im thinking about is when im going to see the stoked one, what im gonna wear, what im gonna say.  The it hit me.  I have NO future with CJ.  None whatsoever.  It could never be more then what it is right now, and I hate what is it right now.  God i wish he wasn't so damn hot.  But I could have an amazing future with Dan.  So i told CJ i would call him when I came back from cortland...and i have yet to...and i dont think im going to.  If he wants me he can come find me cause im done chasing after him.  I have better things on my mind.  So anyway back to my weekend.  Me Angela and Rachael went back later on to see Sugar Ray and they were awesome.  we were 2 feet away from the the entire time and dear god mark magrath is hot...even though i think i spelled his name wrong but whatever.  After the concert was over we all went back to the dorm and got wasted.  After a while everyone passed out and me and Dan spent the rest of the night making out until we both finally passed out ::sigh:: and excellent end to the night.  Im just really excited about this one.  Saying this may or may not be dangerous...but He is different than all the others.


I hope so anyway."

Im not really sure if I regret it or not, i mean i know he probably is expecting it eventually considering I've been teasing him for weeks now, and believe it or not I really need to get some soon or my head is going to explode.  I make things way too complicated for myself.  Too many consequences for just doing something that feels good at the moment.  So god damn frustrating, but hey like i said, I do it to myself.

They try and make it so that the audience roots for the nice guy and hates the mean attractive guy.  I realized the other day that i always want the girl to stay with the mean attractive guy and always hate the nice guy.
Is that weird?
So I've been working like its my job lately and I think im gonna freak out and have a breakdown if I dont slow down soon.  Im actually employee of the month which is kind of weird cause i've never been employee of the month before.  
I've been making out with a new boy names Dan who is really cute and funny and just a good guy in general but im really not so sure if I like him enough yet.  Besides the fact that CJ has been calling a lot more lately.  He called the other night and kind of yelled at me for not calling him and seemed unusually interested in what I've been up to since I talked to him last.  I asked him what exactly the point was in calling him if he's not even coming home this summer and he told me he just told me he wasnt coming home to get me mad and of course he's coming home for the summer.  Why does he like to fuck around with me so much? i have no idea.  He makes my head hurt.  I told him he's lucky he's so damn goodlooking cause if he wasn't I would take this shit from him.  He laughed and told me that I drive him crazy.  <strong>I</strong> drive <strong>HIM</strong> crazy???  Is he fucking kidding me?? The idiots I date.
My mother set a date for her wedding.  September 4th.  Thats 6 months away and we don't even know where we're gonna live yet.  Im tired of going to my own parents weddings.  Can somebody else please get married for the love of jesus.
Ok i think im done with my rant now

So I had an amusing Valentines day.  Pugs surprised me at work with a rose and left a basket in my car which contained a pink stuffed frog and really big rice crispy treats.  It was so sweet and put me in such a good mood for the rest of the day.  Dan from work also asked me to be his valentine and i thought he was kidding so i said sure, and he showed up later with a box of chocolates for me.  he's adorable.  I worked for 14 hours that day which was kinda ironic considering the date was feb 14th. weird.  So yeah it was a boost to my self esteem.

5 years ago today he gave me a box of chocolates and we made out on his bead with Sarah and Johnny O making out in the same room with us.

4 years ago today RJ LaPorte was my valentine and I was just realizing I liked him.  He wasn't gay yet and he followed me around like a little puppy dog.  He gave me Aqua d' Gio perfume and took me out to John Harvards for dinner (how ironic). We watched Blair witch project in his room and held my hand the entire time.  He wrote me the sweetest card I have ever received...even up till now.

2 Years ago tonight Blake snuck me out of my house and took me out to his.  I stayed there till 4 am on a school night and convinced my mom i was sick that day and couldnt go.  Blake came to my door that morning with a dozen roses and brought me to his house we he had breakfast waiting for me. he gave me a gold bracelet and a green stuffed frog which i still keep next to my pillow on my bed.  We spent the rest of the day together.

This year Im pining away over someone that isn't here, mentally or physically.  Un-requited love has taken over my mind and my body. I need to get out of this place before my head explodes.

So I babysat my cousins last night.  I have definitely decided im never having children... at least not for a long long time.  All they do is talk and eat and run around and nag and they constantly have to be entertained, and I am responsible for feeding and dressing them and entertaining them and making sure they don't eat dirt.  It takes forever to get them to go to bed and then they wake up at the crack of dawn.  You would think they'd want to sleep a little of have some privacy or something...but NO.  They insisted on waking me up at 6:30 am and jumping on the bed.  Then they talked my ear off until I finally got up.  Don't get me wrong, I love my cousins and they are adorable, but i also like sleep.  Sara came over to help me out last night and keep me company.  It was really awesome of her to sit through that whole berenstine bears book that took 40 minutes for my 6 year old cousin to read.  Sara needs to be a kindgarten teacher because she is pretty patient.

"event","So yeah, school started again.  Only 3 classes this semester and all of them don't seem too hard but you never know its only the second day.  I absolutly have to do well this semester.  I definitely decided im not staying there for the entire 4 years.  I need to get out of this cold shitty boring island and off the somewhere warm and exciting and...well...not here. Didn't talk to RJ all vacation, but turns out he has the exact same schedule only different classes than me so we're going to be carpooling to school on tuesdays and thursdays.  yeah he's a crazy drug addict.  Nothing too bad like coke or heroine or anything but lets just say he dropped acid during the first day of school.  Where do i find these boys.  They just seem to drop in my lap.  Im planning a trip to florida over spring break.  No, its not because CJ is there...well, not completely.  I just need a vacation and that seems like the easiest place to go.  So far me and Angela are the only ones going.  We asked Erin and she said she wanted to go but i have a feeling that for certain reasons (aka Steve) shes gonna change her mind.  Those 2 are so fucking gay. I don't know we also asked sara, jocelyn, sarah huda, and lauren but i doubt any of them are gonna go.  
Pugs ditched me tonight to go to molly blooms.  We were hanging out watching a movie in his room and erin called him and told him to go, so he said he'd be there in a half hour.  I made it clear about 40 times tonight that i did not want to go to molly blooms.  So he pretty much kicked me out so he could go.  That was nice of him.  Fucker.  
So yeah.  I hate everyone.

im going to bed."

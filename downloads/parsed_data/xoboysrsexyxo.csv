~*I MISS THE WAY*~ i miss the way u hugged me and the way u played with my hair i miss the way u kissed me and the way u'd always be there i miss everything u taught me like when you taught me how to fight i just cant accept the fact that now..im alone at night i miss the way we talked like we were best friends i miss the way we walked the walk that never ends i miss the way we'd mess around like no one else was there i miss the way u telling me.. how much u really do care.. i miss the way we would party hard till early the next morning i miss the way when we would sleep about you, my dreams would be soaring i miss the way you loved me and how i thought you n me would soon be together forever.. well a gurl can dream.. cant she? *"

Find out what kind of driver you are!</a>

You are among the most intelligent and best mannered among all drivers. When you are in a hurry, you may push it a little, but you never race. When you are relaxed, you don't impede others by driving like a turtle. You are mindful of others and occasionally downright nice, but mostly you keep your wits and keel.

Every school has its model student... and Jodie qualifies as three of them. She's intelligent and popular, a condition that violates more than a few natural laws. She never met an extracurricular activity she didn't like.

You're poppy, preppy, and making tons of money. You're the most lucrative band on the market, and you sell mostly to teen girls. You may not write all your own music, you might not play your own music, and you might not dress yourselves, but who cares, you're making money! Anybody who criticizes you is just jealous of your super ""hotness"" anyway, right? 

Well, back to the never ending homework!"

Well Michelle, great quiz, but I wouldn't exactly call me the 'love-a-lot bear' cause as far as I know, I am not getting any lovin'! haha! Oh well, another weekend asking each other ""Why"" and ""What's wrong"". Oh well, that's Nevada and lonely, single girls for you!"

"event","Haha, the funniest story! During finals week, Michelle, Nic, and I went to the Daly (pronounced Daily, spelt Daly)Scoop for lunch. We are kind of 'usuals' there. I guess that's what happens when you live in a small town--there are only so few places you can eat that aren't exactly fast food. The waitress knows our meal--water and the kid's meal of chicken fingers with a side of BBQ and then our Italian Sodas right before we leave-mine is always Raspberry Vanilla and hers is always Vanilla with cream. Anyways, the day we were in there during finals week, I thought it would be funny to unscrew the tops to the salt and pepper shakers. Well, yesterday, Michelle and I went in to the Daly Scoop for our usual, and the waitress came over and said ""Girls, I would appreciate it if you would leave my salt and pepper shakers alone this time."" All we could do is act stupid while crack up inside. She totally bought it. She said ""oh, maybe it was the guy with you."" It was so funny. Totally the highlight of my day....well, until that night! We had such an awesome game against Carson! Very nerve-racking! During the celebration, I got paint all over me from hugging people and the players who had paint rubbed off on them...let me tell you, I did not want to rub one of the paint marks off (only Michelle knows why). Oh well, maybe soon enough. Probably not! Oh well. Only 4 and a half more weeks until NSYNC! Can't wait!"

"event","Welcome,
Well, this is my first entry of my livejournal! My name is Kim, but the special people in my life call me Kimmie! I am a sophomore at Douglas High School which is in Douglas County, Nevada. Think Carson City. Anyways, I play soccer for Douglas soccer and this past season, our team went 10-0 and took second place in the Zone championships! Besides school sports events and movies and maybe bowling, there isn't really anything to do here. The population of our town is less then 10,000 people, so that might explain it. There is much more to come, but it's past my bedtime and mommy is hounding me to get off!"

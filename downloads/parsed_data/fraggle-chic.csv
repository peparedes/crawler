"event","Ok so Steve and I are sitting around having a nice relaxing evening of watching movies, Second Hand Lions is really good by the way.  Then out of the blue my oh so wonderful brother calls us and says ""hey come hang out with us and have a couple beers"", couple my ass.  We get there and of course I don't drink beer, so I thought I was off the hook right?  WRONG! No they had pulled out their hard alcohol just for little ol me, lucky lucky me.  Crystal, my sister in law, makes my first drink which was my first mistake, and tells me ""don't worry it is good for you"" um yeah my ass it is.  Then we start to play up the river, at this point Steve volunteers to stay sober and drive us home which gives Crystal full rein to mess me up.  By the time we stopped playing that game I was feelin really good anyhow.  Then we start to play 3 Man, this my friends is an EVIL EVIL game!  So I end up puking my guts out, 3 freakin times, Joe had to practically pour me into bed, he even offered to hold my hair if had enough to hold LOL.  Why I do these things to myself I do not know but yeah, not drinkin again for a llllloooooooooonnnnnngggg time!  Feel free to laugh insanely at me, have a good time.  LOL"

"event","Well Tabitha is accusing non other than little ol me for calling her work about her smoking weed.  Although this is, in my opinion, funny as hell, I cannot take credit for it.  I don't lie about people just to get them into a whole bunch of crap, not my forte.  Her carma will come back and bite her in the ass later on in life for it, no need for me to do a damned thing to her.  I can't reply to her message to say so cuz she has the friends only feature turned on and deleted me of course but oh well.  Anyhow, if somone would be so kind as to pass that on I would appreciate it."

"event","Ok in case anyone hasn't figured it out I am the parent in question.  Why ya'll are trying to keep names out of it is beyond me but hey whatever floats your drama boat.  Here is exactly what happened and what was told to CPS.  My son for the second, not the first, time deliberately pulled down his pants and peed on his floor to impress a friend.  The first time he did this he was dealt with in a much different manner and obviously that didn't sink in.  Anyhow.  His face was NOT rubbed into the carpet, there were 2 count them 2 fucking drops of urine on a blanket, I told him that if he was going to act like an animal then he was going to be treated like one.  So he got his little nose rubbed in the whole 2 fucking drops, and then went and washed his face.  My child was in NO WAY physically harmed, bruised, marked, or maimed.  Nor was he emotionally scarred, I can however guarantee you he will not do it again.  I would NEVER rub my childs face into a carpet that would hurt him.  I made a point to him and it got through.  Yes everyone has an opinion and Tabby and whoever else can be all pissed off about whatever they want but Miss Tabitha, you were NOT in the room when it happened, you did NOT ask for the whole story and you yourself did NOT report me.  You just decided to go running your big mouth to your mother who we all know lies, exagerates things and rarely tells the truth.  We all know this from experience.  So if ANYONE should be told to shut their PIE HOLE it should be YOU!  Yes I am a strict mother, yes I yell at my child when I am irritated with him, no I do not ALWAYS yell, and my son is far from mistreated or abused in anyway and apparently CPS agrees with me because they did not take him away.  I have many many names I would love to call you Tabitha and many many rants I could go on about but that would not get me anywhere, so I decided to simply put the facts in here.  You do not have children of your own and therefor you cannot know what it is like to raise one, therefor you have no right to try and tell ME a parent of 4 and a half years now, how I should raise my son.  I have a good kid, because when he does do something wrong action is taken and he does not walk all over me or anyone else.  I don't let that shit slide, if you think that makes me a bad parent then fine think what you want.  But keep your Goddamn opinions to yourself until you know all the facts.  Have a good day."

"event","Grrr, just when my arthritis starts to do better I get sick.  I freakin have strep throat!!!  I despise being sick but hopefully it will go away soon they gave me Augmenten.  The only problem is no sex for me or a condom if we can't wait cuz it is one of those fun anibiotics that interfere with BC pills.  Hmmm, my throat hurts so much I don't want to swallow let alone eat, and I don't get sex....that doesn't seem very nice LOL.  Oh well I am done ranting for now.  Just felt the need to bitch a little.  :-)"

"event","Ok I would just like to say that I am glad to be back in touch with everyone no matter how little we get to hang out.  I understand having a busy life I have been there, thankfully I am not there right now but I am sure that I will be come September when I start back to school.  Now I don't plan my time with my friends for two reasons, right now (as I said)  I am not busy enough to need to do that, and two that I tend to forget that I have planned things and then feel really shitty when I forget about my friends.  So I am going to say this, I wish I could see all my friends every day but we do all have lives and most of us work.  So I am gonna say this, I am here most of the time, call me see what's up, if you want to plan something a week out due to schedule needs then fine.  Call me and we will schedule something, and if I forget you can smack me.  Or if ya get some free time call and see if we are busy.  I love you all and I am utterly grateful that we are back in contact, I am not going to have some silly arguement tear us all apart again.  We all have phones, lets use them.  Or post it on here.  And lets end this insantity!"

Tabby, Joe and I went down to Riverfront Park and took pictures.  I decided I am going to get season passes for me, Steve, Josh and Joe so we can go down there as much as we want.  I finally found someone to help me learn in my wiccan path but he seems to be a rather busy individual and I don't know if he is gonna have the time for me, we will see.  Anyway, I hadn't posted since my first post and felt the need to do so.  So here I am again.  Yeah me!  LOL"

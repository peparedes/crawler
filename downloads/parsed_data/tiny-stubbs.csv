"event","<p><font color=""#3366ff"">So I think I need to get a job so I can get my own place, and just be like alone I guess. I dont really know what I want. I want a job so I can have some extra money in my pocket... well money period in my pocket. I wanna move out of my parents' home cuz they suck... I guess. I really wanna get my car back on the road... Im thinking about even working at a Bar... something I used to say Id NEVER work at because of my mom.... but I dont really care right now Id rather work at a Bar then no where... and I could prolly get a job at a bar... pretty much anyone can get a job at a fucking bar! I just dont wanna be bitched at anymore for what I do...<br /><br />My parents dont like the idea of me and Danny hangin out everyday... Why does it matter? Me and Ashley used to hang out everyday 24/7 and they never cared about that. Yeah me and Danny have some problems but we're trying to work on them (or at least I am) it takes time to fix things and change stuff. But they just wanna bitch. His mom bitches about me being over here all the time.... Ok so me and Danny like each other company... fuck off... I guess...<br /><br />My head hurts....<br /><br />I havent gotten high today...which isnt normal....(maybe thats why I have a headache...)<br /><br />Im done with my period but I think Danny's getting ready to start his...<br /><br />Wednesday I have to go into Pathways to talk to Mrs. Tepper... gotta get my classes... er something...sign some papers... Dannys goin with me cuz hes gotta do the same but he cant sign the papers cuz hes not 18 but his parents will do that later....<br /><br />The other night I went to my house to stay the night.... Got there around 8 or 9 I think... Went to Penny's got high and came home around 11:00 and my dad bitched and bitched.... he told me doors are locked at 12 it wasnt 12 but he still locked us out including my mom...she was VERY drunk that night... and very pissed at him... anyways he bitched about anything and everything.... talk to my mom.... she bitched about everything and anything. They wounder why I dont like coming home and actually staying there....<br /><br />I told my dad the other day I wasnt gonna get a job cuz I cant.... He tells me to go to the places I put in apps and get new ones so I can put a different fone number on it... yeah ok.... id like to see him go out and do something of the sort.... Not gonna happen... Not really sure how Im gonna get a job.... I think Ill prolly just go back to the places I know are hiring and get new apps... but who knows if theyre even hiring anymore.... I dont know... Havent been to any of those places since I turned in the apps... this shit sucks ass.... now if my dad didnt go to the bar everynight wed still have our fone....heh...&nbsp;<br /><br />ok Im going to bed...just had a few things on my mind that were bothering me.....(and I think Dannys pissed at me) night!</font></p>"

"event","<p><font color=""#ff0000"">SO! I dont know what to type about today. Theres just too much...heh, I think it would be wounderful if I could like one day go to a different state with out anyone knowing about it and like never come back and no one would know where I was.... But I dont think it'll ever happen. Im more likely to shoot myself then to do that.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think Im afraid of guns cuz its like I know if I could get ahold of one I'd be gone. And I know I dont really want to die I just wanna dissapear.&nbsp; Right now if I had a car Im pretty sure Id be GTFO!<br /><br />&nbsp;I still hate myself. I'll say that till I die! heh.&nbsp;<br /><br />I dont really feel like talken about much but I feel like I have to or Im gonna blow.... But this journal doesnt help much....I blab in it and what not but I get no where with my shit talking.&nbsp;<br /><br />I want some drugs. I think if Geny called me up and asked me if I wanted to hang out I would.... Just cuz I know she can get good drugs and thats all I want right now I wanna be numb. I really dont want to feel. When I was all fucked up everyday I had not a care in the world just wanted to get high. Pills are good for getting the pain away ya know?! Maybe when I get a job Ill save up enough money so when I kill myself or od my parents can pay for my funarl... Or just go somewhere... I'd like to be somewhere else right now not thinking of anything not caring about anything, Id be happy in an ally somewhere with something to numb me.... as long as I couldnt feel anything...&nbsp;<br /><br />I dont know how to change myself to something better then this.... I know how to make myself worse, thats easy. But to make my self a different better person............who fucking knows.... Im EMO! As Danny and Tony say... But I guess I am....who cares tho.....&nbsp;<br /><br />I woke up this morning with cramps in my stomach and the shits.... isnt that lovely?! I sure thought so... heh...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Lifes easier on pills.... painless..... I was givin some pills the other day for my head ach... not sure what the where and Danny didnt like the idea of me taken them cuz the person once said they were for back achs and now theyre for head achs... but I didnt care I wanted them... She told me to take one and in like 4 hrs take another one....I took both.... I didnt get SHIT outta it... my headach was still there too.... dumb bitch...&nbsp;<br /><br />My mom the other night took a shit load of her pills trying to od.... she woke up the next day....&nbsp;<br /><br />My mom says I can be a storng person.... How can she say that when shes not even strong.... She doesnt know.... She understands what Im going threw but doesnt know what to do about it cuz she cant even make her self strong...&nbsp;<br /><br />When I get sent to the hospital for an od... I get bitched at cuz my dad has another hospital bill....&nbsp;<br /><br />Danny said something the other day.... ""Only if we had friends"" only if we did... Things are suposed to change between us.... is it? has it?<br /><br />&nbsp;I dont know why all this shit just like hit me... I was fine playing my game and then all of the sudden I went DOWN.... and I smoked a bowl hopen to go back up and now I just wanna cry and cry.... If I was at my house I prolly would be but cuz Im sitting right next to Danny I can....&nbsp;<br /><br />I wanna be held. I wanna be a dog or some kind of animal... A wild animal so I dont have someone there saying NO.... I just go... a Turtle! a very big one so no one messes with me!<br /><br />Only if I had some money right now....and my car...

"event","Well I have like 7 days till my birthday and I'll be 18. Im almost 18 and I have WAY too much stress and its not fair. My brother should be goin to jail here cuz he beat the shit outta some little kid and put him in the hospital. Squirlle helped him. Shane stood there telling martye to stop...dumb ass and me and danny walked away. Im glad Danny has his head on right some what. 

Curwoods comin up soon and me and Danny are suposed to go together. Watch the bands and stuff. =) we were gonna go to the car show the other day but we instead packed his shit up in his room to get ready to move. Hes movin again... not to far but still. 

Im tired and Id somewhat like to just fall asleep and not wake up. 

I hate the fact that I have to stress about everything. My moms been laid off pretty much. Because of her ONE resriction. My dads in jail untill the morning of my birthday. 

Id like to go back to my counsler and what not but I dont want to be stuck on meds Id just like to be able to talk I guess and maybe get a little help. But meds dont seem to work with me. My problem isnt a chemical inbalance I never had a fucking father and pills arent gonna help change that.

Oh yeah I dont know if I've said anything before but me and Danny are back together and so far so good. A little more then a month now. We're doing ok but I wish he'd agknolage it a little more but he seems SOO much more happy now...Ive seen him smile a lot more now then I have in a long ass time... but I dont know. He seems happy with me and what not... I know I feel a lot happier then what I used to feel... me and danny being happy is prolly the only thing thats going good for me in my life and its GREAT but ya know Id like to not have to stress about my fucking family. I dont know how Im suposed to EVER have my own life if I keep stressing about my parents and shit. I wish I could fix it... arg 

I'll be getting my licens here pretty soon hopfully. 

Its sad that Dan and Kathy have to move outta this house. I like this house and I know they do and this house used to be MY home too... =( They have to get rid of cloud and ozzy...=( I cryed when moomoo told me that. I love those cats!

Awhile ago moomoo bought me a sound card for my computer so now I have SOUND! YAY! lotsa music on my puter. I might have to take it back to my house cuz Danny might not have enough room for it in his room but I guess we're gonna see. I hope he does! I like playing W.o.W. its fun! =D

I didnt go to Ashleys baby shower cuz no one else was going. I feel bad but yesterday I went over to her house to see what she got but NO I couldnt come in and check it out cuz her stupid b/f was on his way home from work and he dont like me cuz I told Ashley that he tired to get in my pants. Well the mother fucker might be going to jail cuz he was fucking around with Alisha and her mom called the po po's on him.... Im losing my best friend because of a fucking guy and its bull shit. I dont even know who she fucking is any more. I cant hang out with her without worring about lloyd coming home or him being there. And it sucks. Danny told me I should talk to her but I dont think its gonna work cuz shes in love with him and what not. Im just her neighbor now. 

I have one friend left and thats Danny and the mother fuckers slowly but shurly getting my trust back.

Im getting ready to start here soon and damn it I need to so It will be done by the time my birthday comes around! 

Well I guess Im done for now with this blabbing of mine"

Him and my brother got into it again and my brother did the most damage but my dad started it. Me and Danny were'nt friends fer awhile there and then kinda started being friends again.... Ive been at his house for like 3 weeks to a month. Tryin to get my schooling done and this is the only place I know I'll have a ride. I think I got a small case of food poisioning yesterday and still today. Its not fun lemme tell ya! If Danny decides he doesnt want to try one last time (3 times a charm?) then I dont think Im gonna be here much longer... I dont want to get close to him just for him to push me away in the long run ya know. I gotta talk to him about it but I cant get the balls to do so.  Idk... oh well Im done for now. BYE"

This place inside my mind a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances.
What if I should die?!?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't now the chances. I'm so blind!

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't now the chances.
What if I should die?!?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Deeper, deeper, deeper inside me
I live a life that seems to be a lost reality
That I can never find a way to reach my inner self.
I stay alone.
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the grey that clouds my mind.
This time I look to see what's between the lines.

I can see, I can see, I'm going blind... (12x)
I'm blind! (4x)

Look at the pages that cause all this evil

Five, six, pick up sticks

The most you'll hear me say when Im at a party is, ""Hey wheres my lighter?"" and, ""Hey can I get a hit off that?!"" or ""Can someone seriouly give me a cigg please?!"" Other than that I say nothing I wont say anything unless I have to. I dont talk, I smoke yer shit and yer ciggs and leave with out even saying Hi...

Now when Im at home partyin its a different story... 
Im the stoned chick you see running around aimlessly laughing at the people that are there...I'll give you a hug if I know you... I'll talk to who evers talking about anything Id like to talk about, I wont smoke my weed or ciggs with you unless you ask me and then prolly take you in a dark area youve never been before, toke up with who ever you are and light up a cigg to go with it, then take you back to where everyone else is at and I prolly wont talk to you for the rest of the night... Also when I start getting mad you and everyone else at my house will know... Once I get sleepy its time for all you mother fuckers to get out and I dont wanna see yall for another week er so...

When Im by myself...
Scared and lonely, Im still the quite stoned girl but sittin in my room doing nothing but dicken around on the computer and the bass. Not much of a life I have. By myself I have no fun. By myself I dont know what to do or what to think, By myself Im someone you dont know. Somebody youve never met. You dont know the real me. Maybe if you had a camera youd be able to see this strange stoned quite chick in her room doing the stuff she normaly does. I have written things down about how I feel but still no one knows. They dont know Rose. Next time someone asks you, ""Do you know Rose Tate?"" Be like, ""Yeah... Ive seen her before, Partied with her in the day but cant say I KNOW her."" Ya know why you cant say you know me?!!!?!!!??? Cuz you DONT fucking know me so keep it at that. (If I was high right now this would sound cool) When no ones around I smoke my stash of leafer andlisten to loud music, burn insence, smoke my ciggs and drink soda... R.C. mainly. I drink R.C. cuz its cheep and cuz my momma moo moo got me drinkin it AND my other little brother Scotty. Me him and my bro would sit around, play games and drink R.C. when we were growing up. If you knew me then you would know that Im crying when I type the words momma moo moo... And if you knew me you would know why tears fall from my big blue eyes when I think of my momma moo moo...

No shes not dead, no shes not gonna die either...not anytime soon. If you knew me then you would know that shes a lady that took me in when my family wanted nothing to do with me. She gave me her hand to hold for guidence and she gave her shoulder to lean on when I had these tears of pain comin outta my pretty blue eyeys. Shes the lady that told me to keep my head up when things were down and just keep goin. She told me to never give up on anything. She got a better part outta me. She seen the good I had in me and pulled it out and help every step of the way... But see if you knew me then you would know that I fucked it all up. I gave up on everything I was starting to get. I tryed to give up my life more then once. I lied to her about her son. I didnt care anymore. I let everything just go and this woman, still, she holds her hand out to me when I need it, she still lets me use her shoulder to cry my painful tears on... to her I just fell down and I'll get right back up and do it over again. And she wants to help me up like she did the first time. This woman will not give up on me no matter what I do. You now know why I cry when I think or type the words ""momma moo moo"" But you still dont know me... This stoned confused chick has more things about her then even she'll ever know..."

"event","Going Under
Now I will tell you what I've done for you
50 thousand tears I've cried
Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once
Not tormented daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
So I don't know what's real and what's not
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under
Drowning in you
I'm falling forever
I've got to break through

So go on and scream
Scream at me I'm so far away
I won't be broken again
I've got to breathe - I can't keep going under


Haunted


Long lost words whisper slowly to me
Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
I know you're still there

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you loving you
I won't let you pull me down

Hunting you I can smell you - alive
Your heart pounding in my head

Watching me wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me raping me
Watching me

My Immortal (Fallen)

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all of my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Because your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
But now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I've held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
And though you're still with me
I've been alone all along


lalala read the stupid lyrics and if yer smart enough you might know why i like them!"

I dont know what to do...if i should get off and take a shower and go to bed or if i should play my game and listen to music or just sit here and type and be lonely... well being here in the dinningroom is better then being upstairs cuz up there im really alone... where im at now im right next to my mom... well her room is...ok so this guy named jeremiah is on my AIM list... not sure how he got there not sure who he is... not sure who anyone is on my list OK i know who he is now... Bobs friend... bobs friend was once Genys friend... but she fucked him over and now they arent friends but thats how I met bob and Miah as we called him lol yep... but the rest of these people i dont know... spet ashley and sam...i think i got tiffanys too LOL and KERRY!!!! lol i dont know... i have 24 people on this thing... and 46 on yahoo... and only 4 or 5 on msn.. (ashlye, marty, cassie, big dan, kathy and kirk) oh wow maybe 6..movin on up! lol i never get on that anyways lol I cant belive how white this stupid fone is now...damn... everytime I talk to someone online get kicked... well all i did was ask who this person was on my aim and he said oh hey and bla bla bla told me he was drunk and shit... but w/e i got kicked... everytime i talk to Danny i get kicked..his mom... ANYONE i get kicked and its GAY... but then again all night i havent talked to anyone online but still kept getting kicked... wow i hate dial up lol...Im thinkin about next time i got to kathy and dans house to take my puter over there and put it in my old room and just leave it there so when i come over i have something to do like play NWN or UT or something ya know...instead of sitting next to danny watching him play games all night and not noticing im there heh only when he wants cookies lol... i make good cookies :p doesnt bother me to make them when im there lol...I just like to give danny a hard time when he asks... Im cold :*( I wish i knew what happend with my black zip up hoody that moomoo got me... and my hard rock cafe shirt i wore over to dannys house and never found... :/ i wounder if i ended up leavin my hoody there too and kathy has it somewhere and just forgot about it er something... i dont know but Im wearing dannys hoody... I wounder if this even fits him anymore... it seems like itd be small on him... just like all his hoodies... so squrille has made his self a bad name here... he said to ashley to tell me and my family to fuck off and we werent gonna get the money for him breaking my 85 doller fucking mirror... and some other shit i guess... i hear a lot of people are mad at him... but when he gets back and wont give me my money my dad will be pissed and he'll go to squirlles house and talk to his dad...get the money AND tell him to never come to our house again cuz hes a lier backstabbing asshole fucking squirlle...  he causes too much trouble and shit... and no one likes it... maybe another reason why no one really likes Kerry anymore...over here at least... well maybe Danny still does and maybe like 2 other people but other then that yeah oh well FUCK FUCK FUCK im bored lonely sad depressed angry and i dont know what to do... the first thing i will do tomorrow when i wake up is see if we have power still OMG this gay camercial is on... call this number to met the right man... and its not for women...some black dude and some white guy huggin... :/ kinda yuck.. oh well... moo BLA who-BLA arg ELIMIDATE is on OMG!!! and DAN is on it lol...no just some guy with his name... 1 girl and 4 guys lol why cant i go out with 4 guys and pick the one i like the most...lol i dont really think i would even if they asked me.. i keep spelling THINK TINK.. but i keep fixing it alright im getting sleepy and im gonna take a shower and go to bed i think ok?! ok! poop"

"event","""I hate my self and I want to die"" How many people have you heard say that?! Ive heard it a lot by differnt people and myself... It does get annoying to hear and to say but It how I feel and its the only other way to tell you with you knowing what Im talkin about... I mean its like the only thing people seem to notice... you say something else about how you feel along the same lines but they dont seem to notice it like ""I hate myself and I want to die"" Its sweet simple and its noticeable by everyone...I have this hole in my heart... its tiny..but feels really big...its been filled to a point but never completly... like I had Danny there and he filled part of that hole... but I dont know what the other part is suposed to be... not sure what or who is suposed to fill that thing.... But this little hole Ive got hurts pretty bad... for being so small it takes a lot to fill and it hurts a lot... But ya know Danny doesnt really help with this hole anymore.... In a way he makes this hole worse... I love him too much... and I hate it... Why do people have to feel love or why does it even have to be here?! Ive heard people say love is a great thing... yeah for awhile its great and then it just fucken sucks...I dont want to love and I dont want people to love me.... I dont understand why we have to have feelings... specaily when half the time its a fucked feeling anyways...right now i just wanna hide... Ive been at dannys house for awhile now but today I wanted to hide... I wanted to hide from him, moomoo, and Dan, and every thing else that was livin and breathing... I still do... I dont wanna see anymore...I dont wanna feel... cuz it sucks and I cant handle feeling like shit.... maybe its my anti-depressents that are maken me feel like this... I dont know... I havent really felt so crapy in awhile...I wish there was a place I could hide... doing drugs helps me hide from my feelings... helps me not feel.... but I dont want to do that... cuz I hurt people and I dont want to hurt anyone...but I dont want to hurt either but... as long as they arent hurting then everythings ok...right?! I gotta be good and not do that shit and not try to kill myself so they dont hurt...so they dont cry and be unhappy for awhile... WHY?! I know if they didnt care It would be soo easy to just leave this world behind me and itd be ok...""you dont want to do that cuz youll do to hell and hell is a bad place and you hurt 10 times more..."" well I dont belive in hell...I dont belive theres anything worse then this right now... dieing...no feelings...no thought...nothing but dead...whats so bad about that?! Danny can finish his school...go to collage and move to a different state like he says and get a good job and get married... a nice life... and everyone else can and will do that... right now I dont care... I could careless if I wake up tomorrow... or the next day...Danny doesnt know what to say or do when I feel like shit...I dont expect him to know anything about me and how I feel and what I should do... no one knows... Im stuck here cuz I dont know what to do and no one else does either... Danny and everyone else just knows that I need to stay here... and its gonna get better soon...if i try...I do try and fail... and I hate it... I cant stand it...I try and end up back where I am every fuckin time but I feel even worse everytime cuz I know I just failed AGAIN... heh why cant danny shoot me like he shoots the damn squirlles?! It doesnt matter if a squirlle lives... cuz they are annoying unwanted and a berden on everyones life...right?! well I am too so why does it matter if Im here... I dont know... I wish I could hide my feelings better... everyone would be happy... well I wouldnt be but no one would know that Im hurting... I dont even know what I want really...I dont know if itd be better If I had someone here with me right now or if Id rather be alone...I dont like being alone but being around someone is just gonna make them sad and depressed or pissed...heh...I know I wish I could talk to someone that could actually help me... Havin someone there...holding me and trying to make me feel better would be nice... but I dont have that even if I wanted it...I wont ever have that... But danny makes me feel very unwanted a lot... Im wanted to make his cookies heh...It hurts me to try and picture everyones life without me... sad for awhile and forgotten like one of those stupid T.V. shows..sometimes Ive thought maybe I should just go out and do some stupid shit like steal a car and break into a house and just do stupid shit like that...like what my brothers done... Everyone would be shocked lol I have anger and Im sad...but I dont know what to do with it anymore... and taken out on this stupid earth makes sence to me or taken out on myself but thats what I usually do... I used to draw and write to take out that shit...to get rid of it but it didnt stay gone too long... this is off topic but these fuckers across the river have christmas lights up and on still and I wanna go take em... but I wont Ill sit here and be stupid....I gotta go potty so hold on..k I cant make anyone happy untill IM happy...(been told that) but I dont see me being happy untill Im dead and gone... but then Id be the only one happy... heh Im so tempted to take my mom and dads car and just go for a ride... but my dads still gone and I dont want him comin home and then I do at the same time... why cant I just be some heartless bitch? I dont know but cutting sounds apealing to me right now.... but if I do that I cant be dannys friend... so I dont know what I should do... heh I stoped telling Danny I loved him... he doesnt say it to me anymore either... hes said it maybe 2 times... but now Im just scared to say it... everynight bfore I go to bed with him I think should I say good night danny I love you or should I just go to sleep... I just go to sleep... my room seems lonely and I dont wanna go up there but I dont wanna sit here all night... heh Why cant I fly? like just jump off a house and start flying... or why cant I just all of the sudden fall off the earth? or get kidnapped and never get found and die?! ::sigh:: I didnt want to go home today but I didnt want to be seen by anyone or talked to...i dont know oh well Im seen still here and home... I think danny likes it when I leave... oh well I dont know...he doesnt care... never has... well i guess Im goin to my room to smoke a cigg and play my bass listen to sad music and cry and sleep... bye"

<P>I wrote her off for the tenth time today And practiced all the things I would say But she came over I lost my nerve I took her back and made her dessert Now I know I'm being used That's okay man cause I like the abuse I know she's playing with me That's okay cause I've got no self esteem We make plans to go out at night I wait till 2 then I turn out the light All this rejection's got me so low If she keeps it up I just might tell her so When she's saying that she wants only me Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends When she's saying that I'm like a disease Then I wonder how much more I can spend Well I guess I should stick up for myself But I really think it's better this way The more you suffer The more it shows you really care Right? <STRONG>Now I'll relate this a little bit That happens more than I'd like to admit Late at night she knocks on my door Drunk again and looking to score Now I know I should say no But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go I may be dumb But I'm not a dweeb I'm just a sucker with no self esteem</STRONG> </P>"

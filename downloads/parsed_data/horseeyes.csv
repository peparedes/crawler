"event","This weekend I was really sad that I didn't get to go to Durham, because the T decided to stop in the middle of nowhere for 1/2 hour, rendering me Bus-less. I was pissed because they were going to dump everyone on the train in Wellesley for two hours waiting for the next train. The made everyone get off the train, walk somewhere, and then were like ""oops, get back on"".

FUDGE.

Anyway, Finally (an hour late) we got to Boston, and I was thinking I would kill myself if I had to go all the way back to framingham and walk back to school. So I called Corey, and found my way to Wentworth to visit. Newt was there for accepted students day or something. We stayed up late, watched Million Dollar Baby (Clint Eastwood is awesome. I reccomend the movie.) and went to the Prudential center. Then I woke up around 9:30 this morning and decided to make the 10:50 train back to F-Ham. I'm not tired, but I'm guessing I will be when I have to work at 4 am. Oh well. I need work. This weekend feels weird. I can't believe it's only saturday. I don't have to work for 14 more hours...what am I going to do?"

"event","Well I woke up this morning nervous about my math exam (the third one in one week. death.) On days before exams I go to breakfast with friends. I went w/ Jill and Say and Lindsay. I got to math, and he always makes it frightening before tests, because he's so serious-ish. Anyhow I got to the actual test and it was SO easy! Thank God, because I think I'm doing really crappy in this class.

Anyway, I went to chemistry, and endured. After that I wanted to sleep but I took some caffeine, went to bio, and then Vanessa and I submitted our room selection forms, so we're all set for next year. \/\/00+

Then I went to Bio Lab. It was really easy and only took an hour and a half. Yay! So immediately after I went to OCo with Vanessa, looked all over campus for Shauna,(she was doing a radio show, and we didn't know), went to Towers, then Larned Beach, played frisbee for about two hours, went to dinner, then went outside for a while, then I went to the gym. Spring weather is SO fun for going outside!"

"event","I kind of loathe myself for getting a livejournal, but it's only because there weren't any user codes available for d.j. However, I do enjoy a cynical ferret every now and then. I like this name more than my really old one.  You don't know why, and you wont unless you already do! So Hah! I'll still update my d.j. but this is my aesthetically pleasing one. I want a pomegranite. Pomegranites in bed!"

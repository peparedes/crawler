"event","i keep praying but its really hard. I dont want to break up i mean i want us to be like we used to be....happy with each other. I DONT CARE WHAT HE DOES and he doesnt get that he thinks ill get mad like im his mom or something. I DONT CARE. I love him and i think he loves me and that is enough. He doesnt trust me enough to tell me things and know that i wont get mad at him but at the same time people have emotions and at some point i will be upset and hes got to be able to handle himself at that time instead of using the ""constricting"" thing that he always uses. I set really high standards for him and i realized that with help of my friends and id ont do that anymore it isnt fair. I just want to know that he wants me to be apart of his life and he loves me and cares. thats the only thing i need. Like the little things he used to do like surprising me or doing something like that. I think something is bothering him and i dont know what it is. Maybe its me but i pray that it isnt. I am not Leah sean's gf i am leah and thats how i will always be. I need him to know that i am okay but i want him to know that i want him to be okay too and that i love him UGH i wish i could just print this out and give it to him it would be a lot easier.
Also, He needs to know that this is a two way relationship and i cant do all the changing to make it better to make him happy. Hes got to be able to want to change too. We are both growing. I had to change a lot and i am doing it. all i ask him to do is show me that he loves me. Thats the only thing and show compassion and want to be around or talking to me. thats it nothing else. I DUNNO maybe ill just print this out and give it to him monday"

"event","so here goes

i am OCD very OCD not in the way most people think of OCD I am the one that obssesses about their life and tries to make everything perfect well guess what no one is perfect you have to be who you are and your not perfect. 

I am going to write in my journal and just write so dont take anything personally its me  being stupid

I feel like sean doesnt care about me anymore its more like im horny lets hang out and when he isnt we dont but i dont care i mean i am a good person he should feel like to have me and i should feel lucky to have him it shouldnt be one sided 

I am scared to tell gwen anything. the last few times i did it somehow got out and i feel bad. I know i should learn from mistakes its just hard because   she is considered one of my best friends and its hard to not tell your best friend anything.

I am scared about amy. People are starting to not like her because of spencer and i feel bad. I am having people talk tom e about her in math and its hard. I dunno i dont know if she is making the best of choices. and i am a little hurt that she isnt going to the concert with me and is giving the ticket to the person with the highest price :-\ which i know isnt gwen so i get to go alone


i am scared about my knee appointment today. Its on the really bad knee and i am scared that is going to tell me i need surgery or something becuase thats what always happens.


I am not going to be a wildlife leader because i cant take away the time if they want me to be a junior leader i am all for it but i dont have a day i can take out of my schedule besides monday.

I LOVE DANCE like no other and it makes me as happy as basketball track and VOLLEYBALL did. I am going to start going to the gym and making myself feel happy starting monday morning i am going to go do spin

i have an appointment monday at 4 with barbara. i am excited to see if all of these conclusions i have come to in my life are correct about me and if there is anything i can do about it

"event","you know in the movies with the girls with attitude. When they are yelling at their boyfriends and the boyfriend is all chill wait a minute and sticks his hand in her face so he can talk to someone else

well it just happened to me and i am pissed i did sign up to be fucking ignored. If you want to be with them so fucking bad then go fucking be with them but at least have enough decincy to realize i am unhappy with u and we should talk

We saw andy and timmy there it was awesome we had so much fun. Then all  of us went to chipotle and played soccer and bloody knuckles it was cool and then had some other unmentionable fun it was amazing. I missed them so much im glad camp is coming

"event","life has changed so much lately its unexplainable. I am no longer a sophmore. I would have to say my sophmore year was probably the year i changed dramatically. I lost friends that wouldnt have lasted. If they couldnt deal with the years. I gained friends that i care dearly about. I made bonds stronger with others. I realized whats its like to be loved and not love and love someone. I realized how much i adore being christian and how much i love my music. I am OCD and ADD. I am scared about the upcoming year. Junior year is the year you decide what your future will be. You either stay here and create a life or you choose a college not here and experience life on your own. I am excited but also scared. My life today at this very moment is the best it has been in awhile. I have friends who i care for dearly i ahve a boyfriend who i positively love with all of my heart. I have ajob that i can count on i have my religion to guide me through problems and i have my family still..... together. I love my life at this moment this exact moment in time."

"event","i realized that having a boyfriend takes your life over

you lose touch with your friends

and i dont want to do that because my friends are my life and have been there and will be there after sean.

this week is dedicated to them and the following week will be too


i love you all"

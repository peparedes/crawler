moved back to Atlanta 3.5 years ago.  looking to get out desperately again.  hopefully will be happening sometime in the relatively near future- back up north.  

I am living in Marietta, which I abhor, but too settled in this house to do anything about it.  I am working in retail sales, which I love.  at least, there are aspects that I love.  I get to make people happy, and play with pretty things all day long.  

still have my Reilly, but now have my Becca (an eight year old golden retriever), and my Roxie (a 1.5 year old little terrier mix).  and I tend to revolve my life around my babies.

still single, with every intention on keeping it that way.

don't really do the club thing so much any longer, which is rather ironic considering it was my life for so long.  of course, the real irony is that as I write this I am planning on going out tonight...

hrmmm... that is about it, in a nutshell...  perhaps I will be better from here on out about posting.  heh.  but I wouldn't count on it."

"event","my year of change.

yeah, i know i never manage to post on this thing, but i thought i might try for two whole posts for 2006.

anyway.  major changes.

-patrick and i split
-i got a new job
-im moving out into my own place
-i chopped a foot of hair off
-i turned 30
-my grandmother died
-my cousin died

so yes, this year i turned 30, and it got me to thinking.  i needed to get out of retail, as that it was sapping the life out of me.  so i am now working in the fashion industry, specifically lingerie.

patrick and i were fighting all of the time, so we split ways.  we get along much better now.  i am back to my old habits of one night stands here and there, but the avoidance of major emotional commitment.

i am still in new york, but i will be moving out into my own place shortly after the new year.  i am waiting for enough money to do it properly.  my grandmother left me a little bit in her estate, so i just have to wait on that- and it should be here soon.

and so on halloween, i was on the bus and started talking to this guy randomly. he was really nice and as it turns out, hes a hair stylist.  he offered to do my hair (because those of you that know me know that i am exceptionally lazy about my hair and just keep it pulled back).  anyway, i went in a week or so later (as it turns out, hes like this super high end way swanky celebrity stylist), and i actually let them cut off about a foot of my hair.  the plus side?  i actually wear my hair down every day now.  the down side?  im starting to give a shit about my hair.

the turning 30 thing wasnt so traumatic for me.  it just made me evaluate where i am in life.  and what i want.  i am surviving.

my grandmother died october 18th... she was 94.  and she was truly an amazing woman.  i can only hope to have her strength in life.

then my cousin... she died in march, here in new york, at 44 years of age.  cause?  heroin overdose.  tragic.  she had always had issues, but i did love her.  she just didnt know how to handle reality.  it was probably for the best in the long run.

so thats pretty much it for now..."

but...

Shortly after my last post I had a pretty bad head injury, and was basically out of commission for two months.  Hell, for the first week I couldn't even remember my name half of the time.  I made a simple misstep, fell, and landed head first on a concrete sidewalk.  Pretty severe concussion, and according to family and friends, a major personality shift to go with it.

So I was out of work for about six months (Patrick was a doll- totally supported me, and I'm not just talking financially).  So now I'm working at a high-end lingerie store...  Sadly, I make more working retail than I would in almost anything else at this point...  Commission is a wonderful thing, let me tell ya...

My poor Huey passed away just over a year ago.  I miss him still.  And two months ago my baby Grady White passed away as well.  My first kitten, I got him the day before my 14th birthday.  He was living down with my parents, and everything possible was done to try to save him, but his central nervous system shut down.

But, I have my two new angels, Emma and Becca.  We got Emma July 4th of '04, when she was just eight weeks old, and I have to tell you, she is my baby girl.  Miss Becca we rescued (this horrible family was going to put her to sleep!) just before the new year.  She has now been with us almost three months, and I don't know what I would do without her!  Kitten situation is still the same...  Emma and Becca can be seen at www.TheGoldenBugs.com

I have a MySpace account now...  www.myspace.com/ragdolldance

Ummmm... That's about it..."

"event","i gave up.

my car is now parked out in front of my apartment.  i put up a brave front, but i am too dependent upon my car.  my commute is now down to around twenty minutes in the morning, and forty in the afternoon.  the way i see it is that i am saving around 2 hours a day now.  instead of getting up at six am, i get up at 7:15.  ya just cant beat that.  i just deal with street parking.  and if i come straight home from work, i can usually find a space right out on the street on the very block i live on.  

the job is still going great.  

not much else going on.  the normal stuff.  birthday last weekend.  i am now officially in my late twenties.  at 27 you can still have a plausible argument for ""mid-twenties"", but definitely not at 28- thats strictly late twenties territory.  i can at least feel better about this- patrick is nine years older than me.  heh.  i enjoy that, he doesnt.

reilly is still as cute as ever.  as are my other two, punkin and hannibal.  little love bugs, i tell ya.  

i want a puppy tho.  patrick is kind of for it, kind of against it.  i say we should be practical and get a small doggie, like a yorkie or westie or something.  i mean, afterall, it is going to be living in an apartment.  it would be cruel to have a big dog.  but he refuses to be seen walking a small dog like that.  something about diminishing his manhood or something, i dunno.

i think part of it is the fact that i grew up with dogs.  first buffie, and now huey.  well, kind of now huey- he lives down in florida with my parents, and, unfortunately, he is dying.  he has a tumor the size of a grapefruit on his spleen, and its inoperable.  the vet says that he should have another three to six months, but he said that like three months ago.  but i was down there last weekend and saw him, and he looked good.  a little thinner than usual, but his normal chipper sweet self elsewise.  i made sure to give him extra love and attention while i was down there, and made sure to give him a goodbye.

i swear, pets should live forever. 

oh!  and i swear, the jersey shore is so weird!  we were down there over memorial day weekend, and while the beach was crowded, it was only like 70 degrees, and no one was in the water.  when i asked why, i was told that the water temperature, in late may mind you, was in the fifties! brr!  thats just fucked up!  i am so used to florida beaches, where you can pretty much swim in the ocean eight months of the year.  and you have to pay to go on the beach there too!  new jersey just nickels and dimes you to death, between the garden state, the turnpike, and now the beaches, what a ripoff!

ok, thats it for now..."

"event","i have moved yet again.

civilization beckoned.

i could no longer live in a place where you cant get a bite to eat after nine pm.  work sucked (poor management) so i quit there just before christmas (freaking vermont natives, they wouldn't even let me have the day after christmas off to go be with my family- assholes).  

we are now living down in manhattan, on the upper west side, right by central park. i have back to having a more than an hour commute, but its totally do-able, since im not having to drive to work- i just sit on the subway and drink my coffee and eat my bagel.  hell, i dont even have my car anymore (ok, so technically i still have it- its parked down at the jersey shore waiting to be taken down to florida to live with my parents, so it will be there for me to drive when i go down to visit).  patrick still has his car, and its parked up at his parents house in the bronx.  makes things nice and easy.  theres no parking in our neighborhood, unless you want to hunt and hunt to try to find street parking (which is damned near impossible), or pay like forty bucks a day to park.  oh, we could get a monthly space, but we have decided that its just not worth it at the cost of $400 a month (minimum).

so im still working in the same field, still love that...  being paid ok...  and i love the people i work with- they are terribly friendly.  

we are still planning on getting married sometime this fall...  thats the plan anyway, but neither of us are pursuing it agressivly.  i kind of like this living in sin thing.  heh.  

anywho... thats about it for now...."

"event","ok, so its been seven months, not six since my last posting.  almost everyone i know that uses this thing i have lost touch with, but still...  i miss ya  :)

i am now living up in vermont.  its beautiful.  the people rather suck, but it is beautiful.  i dont know what i expected with the people, but i guess that i should have expected it from  town that churned out ben and jerrys and phish.  my daily commute is down from an hour and a half each way to less than ten minutes.  hell, i come home for lunch every day.  

we live in a house that has a view of lake champlain (ok, so its an obscured view, but a view nonetheless).  it has a nice little fenced back yard for the pups, a full basement, and our neighbors are great.  

my job is quite nice.  i work with good people, the patients are great, and im actually treated with a modicum of respect...  what a novelty!  i do have to say that i am enjoying it.

my boi, patrick, and i are doing wonderfully, although at this moment he is off in amsterdam doing something with the family business (i dont even pretend to fully understand that part).  he wont be back for another week and a half  :<  its weird... im not used to being alone for that long anymore.  i mean, i used to live alone all the time.  theoretically, i lived with my parents, but they were almost always down in florida, maybe up in atlanta for a total of one month a year, if that.  and my brother was technically living there, but he was never home, always over at friends or at work.  so its like way weird for me to be truly alone here.

i mean, hell, he and i have been together for almost a year now.  we are going to quebec city next month to celebrate our anniversary.  and we have been together almost non-stop since we first got together, so its totally weird being by myself.  jeez, i think we are still on like our third date or something.

my angel, reilly, is now a big, fat, fluffball, and just as sweet as ever... and i have two new ones...  patrick had two cats and two dogs when we got together, so we merged our happy little fuzzy families.  :)  hannibal and punkin are the new kittie-kids, and salinger and dalai are the canine companions.  

hmm...other than that, all is well...  maybe i will try to be better about posting a bit more often?  no promises tho...  heh...

i havent posted in like forever and a day.  and lord, have so many things changed.  1- i no longer have my part time saturday job; 2- im engaged; and 3- well, im involved with someone and we are moving/have moved to vermont.  burlington, vermont to be exact.  right now we are bouncing between burlington and atlanta.  we are up there a lot of weekends (tho we are going to be down in atlanta definitely until mid december- hes out of town most weekends, plus thanksgiving, plus my last day at work down here isnt until dec. 13).  i even already have a job lined up up there.  im all excited.  :)  i start up there in january.   whoo hoo!

things just needed to change.  i hate atlanta, always have.  thats not going to change, ever, i dont think.  and when i went up to vermont, i fell in love.  its beautiful.  and the boy has spent a great deal of time in the new england area, and he loves it.  too damned many bad memories here in atlanta. i need new stomping grounds.  things have gotten way bad lately.  my health is suffering- both mental and physical.

ok, i guess that is pretty much it.  heh.

perhaps i will post more at a later time (but hell, that could be six months from now, ya know?)

it takes me all of fifteen minutes to get here in the morning, and twenty to get home... i dont think i could ask for a better commute unless i was working from home.  hehehe.  granted, im currently working at a different office, not the one i am permanently going to be at, but still, not too shabby...  the drive to the other office is about the same, just reversed- a bit longer in the morning, and shorter in the afternoon.  still, less than seven miles one way, and thats to the office i will be at on a regular basis.

see, right now i am at a office closer to my house, but thats just so that i can train while nicole, shes the admin asst here, gets ready to go on maternity leave.  then, while she is gone, im going to be here.  once she comes back, i will be back at the other office.

the rally rockin' cool thing is that i will be getting a discount on a really nice apartment complex... it will make it totally affordable for me to live in a swank, two bedroom, gated community with a nice pool, tennis courts, etc...  and its less expensive, with discount, than any of the one bedrooms that i could possibly find.  :)  YaY!  

things are working out well.  heh.

i love this working in a stress free environment.  i like working with nice people.  i like being around people that are decent, hardworking, -honest-, and reasonably intelligent.  such a nice change of pace  :)"

ok...  i have been spending way too much time thinking and being all introspective and such, and i have realized a few things.

one of the major things that i have realized is that perhaps i dont always express myself terribly well.  this has evidenced itself a couple of time over the past few weeks.  specifically, i have realized that i dont express what it is i want right now very well.  see, its either this, or what it is im looking for (and this is in a ""romantic"" sense) is that bizarre...

see, i really dont think that it is odd at all... but here goes...  im looking for someone with whom i can spend time, have rocking good sex, and just enjoy myself.  im not looking for love, or long term permanence, but i also want this arrangement to be monogamous.  is that really so weird?  am i the only chick out there that isnt looking to fall in love?  shit, ive been there, more than once, and im not looking to go back there.  im not wanting that again.

am i just asking for too much or something?  every guy that i seem to come across is either looking for a casual fuck, or something far more serious than i am willing to even consider.  i just want something in between.

right now i am sitting at kinkos, because this is where i can get internet access.  for some fucked up reason, ma bell decided to short out my phone.  last night when i got home from work, i couldnt get online.  i thought that there was a phone off the hook, but when it wasnt the ones in my room or the one in my brothers room, i decided to just go to bed and not worry about it anymore from there, that it would right itself or something.  well, tonight when i got home, it still wasnt working.  so i frantically ran about the house unplugging all of the phones, and then plugged just one back in, and it still wasnt working.  so i called bellsouth, sat on hold for forty five minutes, and was told that they wouldnt be able to get someone out until monday evening.  ugh.  talk about sucky!  so basically, if anyone wants to get in touch with me, cell phone or know that i wont be answering my email until monday night, if i even have it back then.

<a href=""http://www.therosebed.com/reilly/"">Reilly</a> is still absolutely wonderful.  i am so thankful that i got him.  he totally cheers me up and makes me feel worthwhile  :)  its a good thing.  im enjoying this aspect of mommyhood.  heh.

i have recently discovered the joy of those artsy cafe's where you get to paint your own pottery.  i have become addicted.  i want to paint an entire set of dinnerware myself.  heh.  its totally obsessive of me, i know, but i love it.  marybeth and i went wednesday night, again thursday night, and we are going back tomorrow.  i cant wait.  whoo hoo!  reilly is getting a new dish, one with his name on it, and i made a jewelry box, and a christmas ornament, and this really cool tile with a dragonfly on it.  i know, i know, totally silly... but still.  :)

work is the same as usual.  for now, im sticking around.  it really isnt so bad... these days, i should just be thankful that i have a job, ya know?

"event","ok, so i havent posted since my little emotional meltdown of just over a month ago, so i guess its time to write again.  heh.  

things are pretty much ok now...  but, the trip did make me realize some things:

1) i can be friends with an ex.  mike and i werent meant to be together, but when we went out and had lunch that saturday, and just sat around talking, we did wonderfully.  we got along, and it made me realize just why i love him so much, and just why i cant be with him (he is rather infuriating at times).  i mean, i guess i always knew that i -could- be friends with an ex, but this is going to be the first one that i truly gave a shit about that i am going to stay in touch with.

2) i have some really fabulous friends.  i mean, absolutely wonderfully fabulous.  misty and maeve and marybeth and john here in atlanta that called me and wrote me to check up on me.  ethan and mike and cristina out in california that put up with me when i was absolutely flipping out about being stuck out there.  i just have managed to surround myself with some rather wonderful people.  i am truly lucky.

3) i have the best parents known to man.  not that i didnt already know this, but it was further confirmed.  my parents called me all the time to check up on me, and make sure that i was ok.  they offered me money.  they gave me emotional support.  i have great parents and i love them.  :)

4) atlanta really isnt that bad.  i think im going to end up staying here for a while.  im even thinking about buying a place here now.  i cant sponge off of my parents forever, and i really just want to have something to call my own, so i think im going to do it.  just a small condo.  i dont think california is the place for me after all.  the ground shakes, and i just dont like that.

5) i really really really cant afford to be taking off for trips like that.  im totally maxed out now.  and i got my cell phone bill for the trip- $500... all roaming charges.  now tell me, how out of control is that???  of course, i was kind of expecting it.  heh.  but point being, im broke as a joke now.  credit cards maxed (ya know, another $500 for the rental car alone).  gas was up over $2 a gallon. i just spent way way way too much.  so now its time to recoup.  bleh.

so thats pretty much it.  

the only thing going on here right now is that my grandmother was in the hospital. congestive heart failure and bronchitis.  but, shes going to be ok.  :)"

"event","Ok, so last friday i manage to actually get some good news.  i dont have cancer.  whoopity fucking do.  what, you think thats good news?  i would normally think so, but given the rest of the week, not fucking really.

ok, so last friday i leave atlanta and fly out to los angeles.  the flight leaving atlanta is late, of course.  i get into dallas, and end up having to run to get my connecting flight.  i catch it, and i get into LA at around midnight.

i get to the avis counter to rent my car, and they are out of compact cars, and economy cars, and all that they have are full sized... so im stuck with a huge boat, a lumina.  doesnt sound like a big deal, but i am, from there, having to drive to vegas.  and i hate driving big cars.

so my friend ethan is supposed to meet me out in vegas on saturday, after i have checked in at oh, around six am saturday morning.  but then he calls at around eleven am to tell me that his office has been broken into, and about fifty thousands of dollars worth of equipment has been stolen, and he doesnt know if he will be able to make it out or not.  so there i am, out in vegas alone, and he calls back to say that he wont be able to make it... hes incredibly apologetic, but hell, it isnt his fault.

so im out in vegas, and hell, i can meet people with ease... so i have an ok time in vegas, even come out ahead money wise.  so i drive back to LA.  

my purpose in going out there is to visit my friend michelle before she moves to virginia.  so i go over to her apartment in LA... understand, this is sunday afternoon.  we are sitting there, talking, with her two brothers, just sitting there, and all of a sudden the earth starts shaking beneath me.  like, shaking hard.  

so i have now lived through an earthquake of a 4.2 magnitude (yes, native californians, i know thats nothing, but when you arent used to it, its quite terrifiying).  

so then sunday night comes along.  now, understand that michelles flight leaves at 2 pm on monday.  she isnt all the way packed- not even close, but she wanted to go out on sunday night to see all her friends for the last time.  so she and i go out to this club called the dungeon.  pretty cool club- the front third does fetish shows, the middle third does industrial music, and the back third does goth stuff.  good music, good fun.  anyway, so she and i proceed to get way too drunk (her more so with me), and we go over to her friend jas's house after leaving the club, since its in walking distance and clubs close at a mere two am (which totally sucks i might add!!!).

we dont wake up until after nine am.  we head out to my rental car (by this time i have changed out my car to a compact- a prizm, thank god).  and lo and behold!  i have a parking ticket!  dammit!  ok, so we get back to her house, im still in my clubby clothing, feeling oh so gross, so around noon i decide to leave them and go on to my hotel, which is at the airport (i only got it for monday night), and meet them at the gate.  so i head down to my room, i get there, i take a shower, i get dressed, and i get back over to the airport.  now, im running rather late because parking was an absolute nightmare.  but i finally get in, and i get to the gate, and they arent there.  they dont even get there until just after boarding started.  so we hurry up, and get them on the plane, and i take off. of course, im crying, because michelle is crying, so the day is already not so good.

ok, so i leave the airport, and i had already decided that i was going to drive out to this city called brea, because i wanted to go to the mall out there. they had this store, called torrid (www.torrid.com), which has fun, funky plus sized clothing.  run by notgothic, i know, but still, its something different.  now understand at this time that i have no idea of the events that were about to unfold in a matter of mere hours.  so i end up spending like two hundred and fifty bucks- because im thinking this is my last day in LA.  i spend like an hour there, and then hop back in my car and head back to the hotel.  thats like an hour and a half trip.

ethan and i had discussed, on sunday, during my trip back from vegas, the idea that we would get together for dinner, drinks, and a generally good time on monday night, my last night there.  so about half an hour after i get back to the hotel, he calls, and we formalize plans.  he gets to the hotel, and from there we end up going out to dinner, at this place called barneys beanery (great place- fab burgers, and with a full bar!).  i run into jas, chelles friend, there, and we chat for a bit.

after leaving barneys, ethan and i went to our old hangout (heh)- cheetahs.  cheetahs is this really cool little strip bar, topless bar rather, that is more like a neighborhood hangout.  but we go there, and we proceed to get trashed, and he buys me lap dances, and drinks galore.  and by this point we are way trashed, and practically pawing at each other.  heres where i should try to explain ethan...  ethan is like the older, jewish, west coast/new yorker, male version of me.  hes as fucked up as i am, we think the same way, and we have this incredible chemistry, i mean, bizarre incredible chemistry.  im hard pressed to think of better sex (although this last time wasnt as incredible as before- though it still -definitely- wasnt bad).

ok, so we end up passing out drunk in bed.  my flight out is at eleven, and he has to take me back to my hotel room and everything, so we get up around seven am or so.  maybe seven thirty.  and i go and sit out in the living room, playing with his two absolutely adorable puppies (sophie and rocco- whom i absolutely adore and so want to steal... a jack russell terrier puppy and a five year old cairn terrier, respectively).  he ends up taking one of them out for a walk (i dont remember which), and my phone rings.  

this moment will live in infamy for me, and is one of those i will never, ever, in all my days forget.  it is misty, one of my best friends in the entire world.  she asks me if i have seen the tv, if i am seeing the news.  i ask what news.  she tells me to turn on the tv... i tell her i cant, that ethans cable is out.  and she informs me, while holding back tears, that i wont be coming home that day.  that i wont be coming home for a while.  im thinking that shes joking, as that she still hasnt told me WHY i wouldnt be coming home. 

so she explains it to me- some fucking jacked up terrorist skyjackers have flown two planes into the world trade center, and the faa has shut down all flights in the us.  i still thinks shes joking-  she totally knows the deal between ethan and i, and i thought she was poking fun. she assured me that she wasnt, and the shock began.  complete, total, absolute shock.  shes telling me the story, as she hears it on the news, i can faintly hear it in the background.  i looked outside at this point, and saw ethan walking up with the pup. i stepped outside, with misty still on the phone, and ask ethan, half in tears, if he wants a houseguest for a day or two.  he somewhat shrugged it off, and asked why...  

i proceeded to tell him...  ethan is a born and raised new yorker, from brooklyn.  his family is there, his friends are there...  hes only been in la for like four years...  he totally thought i was joking, and then went and turned on the radio.  at that point, it was confirmed.  he stepped back out of his office, where the radio was, and walked back out to the living room, where i was still standing, with a look of shock on his face.  at that time his partner called, and they closed the office for the day.  and we then both sat there for a moment with our eyes glazed over with tears.  

we sit around for a few minutes, i call the airline, and reschedule. (oddly enough, they werent busy then...).  i rescheduled for the next day, same bat time, same bat channel. we are both still crying at this point, both in complete shock.  we decide to go down to my hotel, to get my stuff out (this, of course, is after he assures me that it is definitely no problem that i stay with him).  

we get to my hotel, and sit there, watching the footage, watching cnn, abc, nbc, cbs... all the while in disbelief.  we are both frantically trying to call our friends and family.  my father had been in new york, and as far as i knew was still there.  i didnt even know where in new york, but the fear was still there (as it turns out, he had caught a flight the night before... the red eye into west palm beach).  and all of ethans friends were in new york... his business partners brother in law worked in the world trade center, and no one could get through to him. 

anyway, fortunately for ethan, he knows no one that was directly hit by this- thank god.  but unfortunately, for ethan, he now had an extended houseguest.  an indefinite one. 

so there i am, stuck in LA, with the world falling apart around us.  and my flights keep getting cancelled.  i was promised that my flight on friday morning would definitely be a go.  

yet here i am.  i knew that i couldnt impose on ethan any longer.  when i called the airline this morning, to find out the status, it took me almost two hours to get through.  i had to get a friend back in atlanta (misty) to check on the website, and shes the one that told me it was cancelled. 

so when i talked to american this morning, they told me that the earliest i could make it out of LA would be sunday evening or monday or tuesday most likely.  i asked about flying out of orange county- that was a no go... long beach- definitely not as well.  i then asked about phoenix, and they indicated somewhere on thursday or friday.  

i was then told something that made my blood run cold...  they told me that if i could get up to san francisco, i would stand a much better chance, since there are three major international airports in the vicinity.  im told that i can definitely be on a flight saturday night.  so i take it, crying.  

and i call mike, my exboyfriend in san francisco. the one that totally broke my heart.  the one i am -still- not over.  the one whom i wonder if i will ever be over.  and i ask him if i can stay with him.  im crying at this point.

the weeks events have completely taken their toll on me... the earthquake, michelle moving, the terrorist bombing shaking me to my very core, being stranded in california with no way out, my parents down in tampa having to face a hurricane coming through (and worrying about their safety), and now... now im going to have to stay with my exboyfriend.

so here i am, in san francisco.  crying more often than not.  worrying about things i shouldnt.  and im in mikes house.  and fortunately, hes not here.  he left his key for me, told me to make myself at home, and said that he probably wouldnt even be home tonight.  i didnt even see him- he said this on the phone.  

im still crying.  im still worried as hell.  im terrified of getting back onto a plane- especially a transcontinental flight.  and im having to deal with this uprush of emotions over mike... things i thought i had packed away.  

anyway, no one will probably read this, and thats fine.  thats not the point of this.  i know i feel better getting this out of me.  i needed to get it out.  i have been way too emotional.  its hard not to be.  these are trying times for everyone.  i know my story isnt that special- but it is mine, and it is hitting me pretty hard.

ugh.  anyway... i guess thats it... im sitting here, watching cnn coverage of the days events, crying, at mikes computer, and im about to go and have a cigarette, and then go crash out on his sofa.

i have another doctors appointment this friday.  hopefully after this i will have a better idea of whats going on.  the thing is moving, and thats a good sign.  but, the last test results came back as undetermined or unrecognizable or something.  so its still all funky and stuff.  im not nearly as panicked as i was a few weeks back, when i was sure that i was facing my impending death.  im dealing with it far better now.  and i really really really want to thank L.  she has really made me feel a lot better about this, and she has shared quite a bit.  thanks hon  *kissez*

oh!  and i went out on friday night (shock of shocks, i know!).  and i got to see tons of people that i havent seen in ages...  and i got to see brandon before he leaves town for boston. but i ended up staying out all night on friday, getting no sleep, and then i had to work on saturday at 11, until five, and i swear, i about near passed out driving home from work i was so exhausted.  i dont think ill be doing that again for a while.  heh.

"event","ugh.  got a call from the surgeons office this morning.  they took a look at my mammography slides.  they dont know what it is either, so we are waiting on the results of my lab tests on the bloody fluid that was aspirated before anything else is done.  so for now, the existing appt stands.  but, i told them that i was available if there were -any- cancellations.  she said that they would prolly be able to work me in in the next week or two.  thank god.  i mean, im right across the street and all- makes it easy.  but im not panicking.  its not worth it.

on a side note, im going down to florida for the weekend.  leaving this evening after work and heading out with misty.  i need to get away and all.  im all sore, having to take painkillers and all.  i need a vacation, even if its just a little mini vacation, i deserve it.  too much stress for the past few weeks, now im just going to chill out on the beach and unwind.  heh.

im just ready for this whole situation to be over with.  im sick of feeling like someone slammed into my chest with a sledgehammer.  and im not just referring to the physical pain i am in."

"event","ok, so my ob-gyn called me back this morning.  she is referring me out to a surgeon.  the good news?  the surgeon that she has referred me to is one of the best there is.  he specializes in breasts.  the bad news?  his earliest available appointment isnt until august 31st.  so now im stuck back in a holding pattern.  which totally fucking sucks.  

the only results that have come back thus far are ""inconclusive"".  hows that for ironic.  hurry up and wait.  ugh.  this is getting incredibly difficult.  more and more difficult with each passing day.

this morning it took me about, oh, thirty to forty minutes just to get dressed i was so sore.  ya know, its not enough that they jab needles into you, they have to squish your tits too.  i didnt know my tits could get so thin!  ugh.  mammograms are reason alone to get bilateral mastectomies.

"event","*kissez* to all those who have made such positive comments.  i appreciate it.

well, i went to the doctor this morning.  the doctor attempted to aspirate the lump, and she got out about 2cc's of bloody fluid.  so thats getting sent to the lab to be tested.  of course, thats after having her jab and poke and prod around in my breast for a while (i have a way pretty bruise now, lemme tell ya).  because the lump didnt collapse, and because there was such a small amount of fluid collected, the doctor referred me out to get an ultrasound done.

thank god stacy, who works at the ob-gyn that i went to, worked to get me into the breast care center on a walk in basis today.  she sat on the phone for about twenty minutes getting them to agree to see me, to work me in.  

so, i go over there, fill out all the requisite paperwork, and get to sit there.  and sit there.  and sit there.  so then i get the ultrasound done.  the lump is shown to be a solid mass, not liquid filled (ie- not a cyst, which everyone was saying that it was).  the doctor even came back in and re-did the ultrasound herself, after the clinician had already done it.

ok, so they didnt like the results of the ultrasound, so they decided that i needed a mammogram.  ok, loads of fun.  so i got my tits squeezed and pressed- hard!  oh god, it hurt.  still hurts.  im sore as hell.

so, now ive had an aspiration, ultrasound, and mammogram.  

results?  unknown

i get to have a biopsy, once the lab results on the aspirated fluid comes back in.

so, of course, im terrified.  i saw the looks on the various doctors and clinicians faces.  i got asked three times if i had breast cancer in my family tree- with incredulous looks on their faces.  

so now i just get to sit here and wait, and i think this is one of the hardest things i have ever gone through.  

ugh.

anyway, maybe ill post more later, but right now im hurting and tired...

tomorrow is my doctors appt about the lump.  my mom has stayed in town and she is going to go with me.  it will hopefully be nothing *crosses fingers*

im hoping for the best.  mom thinks its prolly just a cyst, and shes a nurse, so i trust her judgement, but i know for sure tomorrow.  so now im like all nervous and stuff.

anyway, im going to go and try to sleep in just a bit, but i will post tomorrow when i hear something.  

i will prolly end up having to have the lump aspirated.  wanna hear something nasty?  they aspirate a cyst by taking a 20 gauge needle, inserting it into the lump, drawing out the fluid, checking to see what color it is.. ranging from clear to yellow or brown or green... if its bloody or has debris in it, it gets tested/biopsied/whatever.  oh, and you dont get any sort of anesthetic... this is done a drs office.

"event","well, i havent posted to this thing in a while, so i thought i might just go ahead and do it.  there has been a lot going on in my life lately.  some sort of major things no less.

i meant to post about a week and a half ago.  i had an unexpected trip down memory lane, and its really been making me think.  when i was a freshman in highschool, i went away to a boarding school.  one of the weekend activities that we had was going to one of the big malls in the area, about an hour away.  i remember that when we went, we always used to sneak off to this bathroom, that was kind of offset from the mall itself, and we would smoke in there.  i know this sounds silly, but that bathroom was very memorable.  like, way high class, with not stalls, but separate rooms.  like, little rooms with toilets in them, and doors that closed like a regular door, not a bathroom door.  the doors had slats in them, and i remember sitting in there watching the smoke pour through those slats.  heh.  anyway, when i was at this conference, we stayed at a hotel that was attached to the mall.  during the morning break at the conference, they instructed us on where the bathrooms were, and when i walked in, i was totally thrown back into my freshman year.  it was disturbing.  totally minor little thing, but a walk down memory lane none the less.

this little flashback has really made me think about some things.  some of the things are things i dont even -want- to think about, others are positive things.  but nonetheless, i have been forced to reevaluate some situations in my life, and put them into proper perspective. 

and there has now been another occurance in my life that has made me think about some things.  last weekend i found a lump in my breast, a very large one.  about the size of a small boiled egg.  i have a history of fibrocystic disease in my family, as well as a history of breast cancer.  in all likelihood, its nothing, just a cyst that has to be aspirated. but im terrified.  i mean, all day long i work with women, some of them not too much older than me, that have had breast cancer.  so i cant not think about it.  i mean, i have a doctors appointment scheduled for wednesday (thats the earliest i could get in), so i will know for sure then, but until that point, i get to live in fear.  i want to say that i dont have anything to worry about, and i wager the odds are like 90% that its nothing, but still, here i am, afraid.  

that is yet another one of those things that is making me think.  i mean, the what ifs that are plaguing me are enormous.  ugh.  i hate this.  i fucking hate it.  all my little minor issues mean nothing.  and this is making me realize this. 

really now... fuck those problems i have with my job.  at least its a job.  fuck relationship problems.  its time to just move past them- and i have.  i have bigger fish to fry.  

being terrified for my life is just one of those things. i mean, i have been scared for my life before.  nothing like a psychotic ex to do that for you.  but this is something else.  when your body revolts from within.  nothing you can do to control it.  i cant call the cops. i cant buy a gun.  i have to sit here and hope for the best.

ive always before taken the attitude of ""well, we all have to die sometime"".  i have lived by that motto.  im overweight, i smoke, i dont excercise (morally opposed to it an all), and generally do nothing healthy for me.  but i think im going to have to change some of that.  shit, im only 25!  ugh.  i think im going to have to quit smoking.  

um, anyway, i guess thats whats going on in my head.  bleh.  i hate this. 

thats not even taking into consideration all the stress i am dealing with in my friends lives.  one of my best friends is dealing with some major health issues, and on top of that is being sued.  another one just got let go from his job.  yet another is having to deal with some major family and job related issues.  and im one of those that manages to take on the issues of others.  oh joy.

ugh.  stress.  

i think i just want to go and take a hot bath."

the ex is now totally out of my life.  he has so completely pissed me off.  not only did i just find out that he has a girlfriend (who has been with for a ""long"" time), he has now blocked me so that i cant email him or IM him.  men just fucking suck.  i guess he didnt like it when i told him that i didnt want to talk about his girlfriend.  go fucking figure, i cant deal with it.  men suck.

one of my best friends, whom i shall refer to as mb, is having issues with her boyfriend as well.  why do men feel the need to control and dominate women, by either hook or by crook?  i mean, she and i went and got a hotel room this past saturday night, and he freaked out.  totally flipped.  we just wanted a night away, to pretend that we were on vacation, and he got all pissy about it.

grrr... totally reinforcing my negative image of men.  i so need a vacation.

i want to know what happened to my friend ethan out in LA too...  i havent heard from him in months and months now, since before mike and i split.  and i left him a coupla messages like maybe a month or two ago, and i never heard back from him.  i miss him  :<  what bothers me even more is that one of the last times that we spoke he mentioned that he might have the big ""C"".  scary stuff.  it doesnt make it any easier that i see the ravages of cancer on a daily basis here at work.  granted, its usually women who have had breast cancer, but i still see it, and it still bothers me.  

bleh.

things just really arent going well. 

i guess being happy is just too much to ask.  hell, even being content is just too much to ask for.

"event","eesh...  my birthday is this week...  scary... a quarter of a century old as of wednesday.  hope i get some good presents.  heh.  actually, im not expecting to get much this year.  and the one person that i actually want to remember my birthday wont- i know this.  bleh.  but im going up to chattanooga for my birthday to see the aquarium with my friend carl, so i should have a good day.  :)  

im taking wednesday (my bday) off of work, and im taking friday off too.  of course, on friday i have to take my car into the shop to get the ac worked on.  last weekend (memorial day weekend) my ac went out.  and it couldnt have been worse timing, since i was down in florida, where it was -extremely- hot.  i was not pleased.  but, im going to go ahead and get my cd player installed while im there, so that rocks.  its actually a six disc changer, so thats even better.  heh.

anyway, nothing major going on.  today was laundry day. whoo hoo!  i lead such an exciting life."

"event","today is a weird weird day.  all of us in the office are in bizarre moods.  we are cracking jokes and laughing at the stupidest stuff.  heh.

and i talked to my ex (or whatever) last night, and it was a great conversation....  i think we actually are going to be able to be friends.

and the other day, i was talking to my friend michelle (she is one of my bestest friends in the world), and her brother is going to be moving out of their apartment by august, and she wants me to move it.  and i think i might just.  i dont know yet.

i have postponed the bday trip.  i dont know when im going to go, but im NOT going to pay 400 bucks for airfare.  bleh.  too much.

and tonight im having dinner with carl, which should be fun.  he and i always have a great time when we go out.  

so today isnt going bad at all.  things are definitely looking up."

the movie was really good, although terribly predictable.  the special effects are just fun.  and the rock, suprisingly, hes not horrible.  it kept my interest, and i didnt get bored, theres a LOT to say for that..."

"event","hmmm... im in a far better mood this evening.  not terribly sure as to why, but i am.

and i have decided that tomorrow will be even better.  i have decreed it to be such.

i think part of the reason for my recent depression is that i got to spend a week in almost pure silence, where i couldnt hear hardly a thing, and that gave me way too much time to think, and when i do that, i get down.  so im going to stop that now.  im putting that past shit behind me, and moving on.  at least, im going to try to.

bleh."

"event","ok, so my right ear is starting to hurt again.  thats not good.  hmmm... maybe its the fact that i have now gone out drinking three nights in a row, while finishing up my antibiotics.  heh.  that could be it.  *snicker*  i give up, i think im just destined to live with ear pain.  

im tired, and i have no reason to be.  i was in bed by midnight.  of course, for the second night in a row, i passed out drunk.  last night was far worse tho.  at least on monday night i was in a good mood.  last night i was in a foul mood when i started drinking, then got into a good mood, but i ended the night in a bad mood.

but, i came to a good decision last night.  i am going out to california to visit my michelle (one of my bestest friends in the whole world  *G*) for my birthday.  ive checked airfare, its way cheap, and ive already talked to her, and shes way excited about it, so its a go.  it seems like i spend a lot of momentous occasions in california.  heh.  i like that.

oh, but last night i did something incredibly idiotic, that has depressed me all day.  i wrote my ex.  the one i totally cant get over.  and i told him how i felt, and why i was acting weird around him and all that.  and he just got the letter like an hour and a half ago, and he didnt even write me back.

i totally regret writing it, and now im all weirded out because he read it and didnt respond.  but how the hell is he supposed to respond?  sometimes im not sure what it is i expect of people.  im just unrealistic at times. bleh. 

so now im in this funky mood.

oh well.

of course, i have noticed that i do nothing but bitch in this journal.  makes one wonder if anything positive happens in my life.  hell, it makes -me- wonder if anything positive happens in my life."

"event","ok, today actually isnt going to bad.  granted, im exhausted, since i was up at 6:30 and at emory hospital at 7:30 to see a patient, but still, it aint so bad.  :)

days like today are what actually keep me at my job, rather than my just walking out.  hehehe.

nothing else really going on.

i think im going to have to plan a trip out to cali really soon tho.  i miss it so much out there.  my friends out there, the atmosphere, the close proximity of nevada.  hehehe.  

ok, i guess thats it.  my life is soooo terribly exciting."

"event","ok, im starting to think that today is never going to end.  im tired.  and im whiny.  i only got about two hours of sleep last night, and i awoke this morning to guys up on my roof banging away, with absolutely no regards to the fact that i was FUCKING TRYING TO SLEEP!  and my poor brother, he works second shift and was really trying to sleep, he didnt have to be awake that early.  he ended up having to go down to the basement to sleep.

bleh.  the joys of living in a condo.

but anyway, im tired, and i wanna go home and go to bed.

and i cant stop thinking about things that i just shouldnt be thinking about.  i can tell already that this is just so not going to be a good week for me.  its starting out that way already.  

oh well.  anyway, enough bitching for now...
im gonna try to go and get like two more hours of sleep now.

"event","today is one of those bleh sort of days.

i actually got to work early, which is a major feat for me.  im usually like five minutes late or barely on time.  but i managed to get there early.

i had some pleasant patients this morning, but once noon hit, i swear, it brought in the nasty people.  three mean patients in a row.  i woman had an appointment yesterday, didnt show up for it, then showed up today and got angry because we couldnt see her!  ugh.  people suck.

then i was playing online, and ran into an old ""friend"", and he made me think about things i just didnt want to think about.  and i think i made him feel somewhat bad with something i said, and i totally didnt mean it to.  ive just been in a kind of downtrodden mood as of late.  i dont really know why...  i just dont like this time of year, i guess.

ive just been in a somewhat melancholy mood as of late.  i dont even have a good reason for it.  i mean, i guess i do, but still, not -that- good of a reason.

bleh.

anyway..."

oh, and i left my cellphone sitting on my bedside table, so i missed calls all day.  so no maeve, i wasnt ignoring you :P"

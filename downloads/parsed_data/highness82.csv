Being that it's 9:30 already, I should also be  getting dressed but I'm stalling (as usual).  Luckily I only take like 5 minutes to get dressed and 10 to drive there.

"event","quick and simple only bc i havent updated....
Dont know if i was more drunk on tuesday (beer pong at the bar) or last night (went to see my friend wrestle and they sold 2 dollar drinks..then went to 2 bars).  Most likely last night bc I'm still hung over a hundred hours later.  I think doing the open house with no heat (turns out new constructions dont put on heat till later) may have acclerated me getting sick...or i can be using that as an excuse to y i feel like im dying.  More on that another time when i can see staight. 

Everything is pretty good...same shit, different day.  

Some one is tryin to force me out of my house and all i want to do is lay in bed.

Still want to move somewhere else...hey, my mom and my broker are gonna buy a house in florida 2gether! 

Ok i think im just gonna lay and sort thru my head...with lots of excedrin migraine meds."

"event","Melissa and I were up by 530 and on the rode to take this damn state realtor test by 6.  Since we were both still sleeping, neither of us noticed we were going onthe BQE instead of the Belt.  Yea so needless to say, it took us longer than we thought bc we had to back track and shit.  Finally we get on the belt and its pretty smooth sailing..not as much traffic as expected.  Once in LI, we were lookin for the place we needed to take the test in and some crazy man in a school bus was yelling at me bc I didnt turn when he wanted me to..mind u if i turned when he wanted me to i would have been in like a 5 car pile up.  Melissa and I just abused him.  Anyway we get to the test and wait on a line to get in to the 9am test (got there 7:45) and guess what? we dont get in!  so now we need to wait till the 10 am test which is like an hour.  Turns out Melissa is much like me in that she is always cold so we went back to my car (with a pass to secure our spot in the 10am test).  Finally the time comes and we take the test.  It was pretty hard! In fact, like 3 questions we didnt know we tried lookin up afterwards and our text book didnt even have them!  Whatever...we most likely passed tho (pray for us) and now we dont have to go into the office 2morrow bc we dont get the results back until 2wks (my broker thought it would be the same day).  I'm just tired now.  I stopped off at Koch's to show her the pics from her bday.  I actually learned how to use my scanner and stuff now!  I scanned her bday pics in but there are other sets i need to scan in be4 I set up albums or whatever they are.  I would do that now but my couches and bed look so damn comfortable and I'm never gonna be able to stay up for the rest of the night unless I rest now.

"event","Just walked in and i have pillows and blankets all over my room courtsey of my brother...and im not even annoyed by it.  Funny story bout the little brat...Xmas is coming and last yr sants brought his friend Brandon a pokemon game boy game already beaten (it was used obviously).  So this yr, the new pokemon game is coming out (meaning there is no way to get it used) and Adam decides he wants it...heres the catch: Santa must finish the game for him the way he did brandon.  Guess what?  Since I normally play the games anyway and beat them, I gotta beat the game for him.  I have about a month and a 1/2 to do so.  My mom just handed me the game 2day.  Isnt he lucky to have an older sister like me who loves him unconditionally? Yea i think so too...
I spent most of the night hopping around going to see different people at different places.  I cant complain...i had a good night.  But all good things must come to an end and I've been craving my bed since like 1:30 (its now like 4? Got sidetracked tonight and even being as tired as I was I totally didnt notice the time).  It is officially my mommys bday tho...HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOMMY (not like she reads this or anyrhing).
Sweet dreams...I know I'm having some!"

"event","I've been meaning to write on this thing, but i just keep staring at the pc.  First thing is first tho,  Jen S's bday was sunday so HAPPY BIRTHDAY to her!  It seems like everyone's bday is grouped in late october to late novemeber.  

Did i mention Dill and Dennis came to the bar this week?  It was nice to hang out with them again.  Dill is like practically engaged (or is engaged..im not sure) to kim.  I had brought my real estate book to the bar to study for the final...i didnt accomplish much but i did pass.  I'm pretty sure I wrote bout my friday afternoon....not a fun moment...but I'm confident that things will work out for the best.  

Friday night was pretty cool.  It was Koch's bday and she invited me out with them.  It was Jen, Bri, Julie, her bf Nick, planco and me.  Bri actually paid for dinner for everyone (the boys insane).  Then we went to turtle bay (theres a good pic of me sitting on a turtle with john), sutton place, metro, and black fin.  I ran into such RANDOM people and of course i was drunk so i found it hysterical.  I think I spent a whole 20 dollars for the night tho bc everytime i went to get a drink some1 else got it for me.  We had a really good time tho..and i honestly didnt think I was going to considering the mood I originally was in. 

Saturday, I went to the outback with chris, dennis, heather and her sister donna.  Its kinda cute seeing chris and dennis 2gether again even if its not the same way it use to be (which is probably for the best).  I was suppose to meet Jen Shapiro bc everyone was hanging out for her bday but they are really disorganized and couldnt figure out where they were going so I went home and we watched orgasmo (bc i never seen it be4 and Dennis insisted I had to).  Then at 2am i dragged Dennis around SI with me to go get hot cocoa and see jen for a hot 10 minutes.  Some little girl that hangs out with the people she hangs out with trips out on E like at a restaurant everytime i see her.  Its absolutely insane and Im totally disguisted by it.  Now I'm not one to criticize people for using drugs, but Im saying this girl drops a pill at the table and shit...she has like no other plans and does it alone.  Fuckin weird.  

Sunday I took jen to lunch and then went to see the Incredible with my family...it was soo cute.  I really enjoyed it.  I was suppose to go out with jen for her bday but I fell asleep and by the time i woke up everyone was lazy and not moving including myself.  I had to make up a real estate class last night and it was so boring and long!  I wanted to scream the whole time.  I ran out with Josh and Anthony to a bar later that night...love those sarcastic bastards!  

I was suppose to meet John for lunch 2day....and yesterday...lol.  I'm gonna so that 2morrow I think.  Heather is coming down bc its a bar night (which dill and dennis are coming to again) and she wants to go to ikea....Phil decided hes coming too.   
I finally got to pick up the new Halo game for him.  I got it for 30 dollars :-D.  It's nice knowing low people in high places..ie my cousin chris.  I suppose to be showering now and here i am gettin carried away....

My mom has been xmas shoppin and i think she got my uncle to get me the purse i wanted!! I am VERY excited by that.  I better shower be4 Head comes here and yells....    

I want to have a big party one day and have everyone I havent seen or talk to in a while hanging out....Its probably a horrible idea but thats what it was..just an idea.  

You know you love me..."

The bad news is it's my ""un"" anniversary...

We went to lunch 2day, which was nice.  Then we came home and had a heart to heart.  It was certainly about time.  And i am very happy we did.  But now I'm sitting here crying...It's not like I expected everything to change...I kinda just hoped (?).  Well there's still always hope...I just prefer to cry right now. lol.  I do love you....it'll work itself out eventually....

Well I promised Koch I'd go out for her birthday 2night.  Still dont know what we are doing, but I'm sure we'll have fun...well I'll fake it for the most part until I'm loaded and dont remember who I am...good times ;-)

"event","This past week i have been soooo sick. I even had to skip one of my classes and now i have to make it up next week.  Phil has been coming by keeping me company and buying me soup and stuff.  Last night we watched ""man on fire""...there wasnt much of a surprise ending like I heard there was but hey I'm just good at this criminal shit and knew how it worked i guess. 

2morrow is Nov 5th....thats mine and Phil's would be 5 yrs.  It's quite depressing if you ask me.  I dont even know what to do with myself.  He seems to be dealing with it alot better than I am but he's always been good like that...I'm always the emotional mess.  Considering he's been by every day for like the last week I assumed I would be seeing him regardless that we arent 2gether...I'm not so sure anymore....It's also Jen Koch's bday and everyone is suppose to go hang out.  Phil says I should go bc I havent seen everyone in awhile and they all want me there and stuff.  I guess he's right.  It just doesn't seem right not being with him on this day, if that makes any sense at all.  I also have my realestate final 2morrow.  I'm not taking the state test for my license till the 16th, which is funny bc i have uptime as an agent on the 20th.  The test seems easy but i get crazy with tests sometimes and paranoid.  I'm suppose to go see my broker 2night.  I'm still going, but after the convo i had a little while ago I'm just not up for it.  I'd rather be in bed!  I'm also suppose to go down to the bar 2night...blaire is suppose to come (how random is that!).  I have to see how I am feeling tho and to see if heather is alive bc from her away message she doesnt seem to be!  It's also Jen Shapiros bday this weekend...I think plans are on for sunday (is that right jen?).  I'm not even sure what those plans are yet.  

Anyway Koch is on the phone...gonna go

Happy Halloween!&nbsp; Last night was heathers party where we got insanely loaded.&nbsp; Head's basement was totally trashed.&nbsp;I got there and started setting up with her and gave her my gift, which is floor tickets to the korn/chevelle concert in nov (I so cant wait!).&nbsp; My costume was pretty damn cute too!&nbsp; I was having a great time but then some of my friends ruined it for me...i mean not to the point where i still couldnt enjoy my night(no ok thats kinda a lie..i almost went outside and bashed a bottle over some1's head)&nbsp;but just enough to make me realize alot more shit about people.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's funny tho bc i did have a good time tho.&nbsp; &nbsp;Im more pissed at one then anyone else and i promise you will all get a PERSONAL thank you from me for it all.&nbsp; In fact i wasnt sure if this mood icon should be pissed off, venegeful or sick (the wonder of feeling so many things at once!).&nbsp; Obviously i opted for sick bc i do feel sick and im not really that angry anymore...just in shock at the balls people have.&nbsp; BUT ANYWAY!&nbsp; Let's not touch that subject..back to the party.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>So everyone got loaded and it was like a total hs reunion..the long lost Dennis showed up!&nbsp; He grew up so much! and Swanson came with his gf Beth.&nbsp; It was pretty cool to hang out with everyone again tho.&nbsp; Chris and his crew left bout 4ish or something (that included orville and jessica).&nbsp; Gtard and mike came too....anyway, all in all it was fun. I'm so fuckin sick i cant even function properly to type about it. Sadly, I'm not sick off of alcohol..i was gettin sick to begin with..the alcohol just accelerated it.&nbsp; </FONT></P>

"event","Ok so i went to the movies to go see SAW with anthony, jen, abe and phil.  The movie was sold out so phil and I went to see the GRUDGE while the rest went to see SHARK TALE.  Ok so the movie has absolutely no point...but let me tell you it scared the living shit out of me.  I was like clawing at phil the whole time (ironically this was the day of our 1st date 5 yrs ago too when we saw HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL lol).  Seriously, I completely shit a brick. No joke...this movie made me fear japanese people! Thats how freaky the ghosty people in this movie were!! I never seen more freaky weird ass people! Like..omg i cant even describe it they were just WEIRD! and the noise the cat made..omg totally annoying and sick! All in all, the movie sucked so badly tho! lol.

It's like the night of drunken phone calls...why is everyone drunk but me?  I think i had like every mike in my phone book call me loaded (yup u guessed it..all 2!)...the last call was 10 minutes ago from my friend mike (come to think of it i dont know his last name) who is in the city for his friends bday..which made me think I need to go to the city to get loaded again. I love the drunken phone calls tho! They are quite fun, so i tell them to keep calling. lol. Eric invited me to the club 2morrow night but since I'm already dedicated to my Heather I'm not going.  My poor Head has people canceling on her left and right and not the people she couldnt give a shit about...like her actual friends.  But i told her not to worry bc we're gonna get loaded and have fun anyway...and it turns out for every person not coming some random person is coming now! it's like ""hi heather is having a party..y dont u come?"".  I need to pack a my stuff still for it..i'll do that 2morrow probably.

I think I just got Gerard mad at me for giving him girlie advice....it was pretty damn good tho in my defense..hes just a touchy person.  So to make it up to him for possiblely upsetting him more (even if he is a bitch) my shout out 2night goes to him.  ""Dont worry..be happy"" and PS Phil's lil sis saw ur picture 2day and goes ""omg that kid looks like charlie sheen"" LOL though that was funny.

Oh and bc i saw a tow truck pass my block 2day I just need to get this out ""hey jessica..is that alex?""

And with that...and the memory of this movie that scared me so much (hey im not a bitch..it scared everyone i talked to and everyone around me...yes i made friends in the bathroom again. LOL)..I leave with hopes of updating u be4 heather's party...however if i dont, well tough

"event","It wasnt exactly a bad day...and then it became one.  I dunno.  I had gotten angry 2day at phil for something.  It's not like i fought with him or anything.  I think i got more angry at the fact that he just doesnt get it sometimes and explaining it...well unless he finally decides to want to talk about something then it doesnt happen.  He's stubborn like that..its all dandy until the last possible second.  He's alot like his dad too who also doesnt really talk about things.  And normally, I'd admit when i'm really wrong...and this time i am a tad..but i'm mostly right and justified to feel the way i do.  It kinda doesnt help that not only does he not get it, but our would be 5 yr is coming up in exactly 1 wk and I just dont know what to do.  I normally dont like writing about things like this on here but i dont really have people to talk to about it lately.  Come to think of it tho, I'm not really saying much on this thing either.  I'm better off writing in my actual journal or something (do i even still have one? well whatever i'll make one). 

I got my pictures back from this eventful week.  They came out really good.  IF (And thats a big if) i'm ever done being lazy i may scan them bc i actually know how to do that now.  Last night was another exciting bar night. I went as a devil bc as i said chris already thinks im satan.  I have pictures from that too! This weekend is heather's bday party! It's an exciting event.  I'll be sure to update u on the turn of events of the night. 

Anyway I gotta go and take over my video game be4 Adam gets home

I love&nbsp;u and cant wait to go out partying for your bday! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>So what have i been up to?&nbsp; Well the real estate classes are so boring...I cant wait to be done with them.&nbsp; Still get to do my thing and go out...I made a whole bunch of new friends out of no where..some who i even knew back in like HS that i never talked to (HI JESSICA!! lol).&nbsp; Ooo wanna hear something shocking? Gerard graced us with his presence Thursday night at the bar.&nbsp; Shocked, arent u? Lol (love screwing with him!) Friday I stood home after draggin allison to go get wings for my butterfly costume.&nbsp; Then Saturday I went to jersey with my rents by Felicia's and Wesley's house and we went on like a 6 mile hike..im talking bout rocks, hills, steeps, u name it...I was so exhausted.&nbsp; But I rested at Felicia's, slept in the car and was able to make my appearance at Coaches to see Lala's basement's last show.&nbsp; It's so sad! Still, I had an insane time with my cousin and her frineds.&nbsp; I ran into like 100 people i knew including mike, eric and jessica, lauren V, my other cousins, and so on..the list just keeps going on.&nbsp; I never seen the place so packed and I happily got to drink and dance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=1>Things are going quite well.&nbsp; I cant complain..well i can use a hell of alot more money but cant we all?&nbsp; I'm yelling at my friend chris right now for telling me he doesnt vote.&nbsp; You know what..dont complain when the election is said and done and some1 does something that you dont like.&nbsp; As for me, I am&nbsp; behind bush...so gabby take me off ur friends list if u must.&nbsp; I dont see how anyone can vote for a man who #1 looks like his face is gonna fall off..seriously is he melting? or #2 changes his views to suit the people.&nbsp; He isnt changing his views for new info..Kerry changes them every fuckin week to make the people like him and thats sad.&nbsp; Some one who is so flimsy cannt run a country.&nbsp; I respect bush for doing his job whether or not anyone agrees with it...THAT is what makes a good leader.&nbsp; Someone who concerns himself more with the country then what is popular.&nbsp; I admit i dont agree on everything with him but I dont think anyone can ever agree on everything.&nbsp; Besides, all these people who complain...I highly doubt you can do a better job.&nbsp;I'm not arguing anyone..thats just how i feel and I dont care for comments convincing me otherwise. </FONT></P>

"event","** the subject line is used as a shout out to Jen Koch bc it is a rare occasion when we get to go out..such as last night **

To be honest, writing in this thing just is not a top priority especially since alot of the writing has to be curb for multiple reasons.  So why do i keep randomly doind it?  Plain boredom to start.  On Sat after a long night of wahtever it is im doing who the hell wants to actually be awake at this time! So this starts off my day..morning.  So what have been up to in my life?  I started the real estate classes.  I think its the most boring thing i ever did.  Seriously, even if i didnt know a damn thing (turns out i know alot about real estate already) I'd still want to slit my wrists.  I'm kinda considering getting a part time job till im done with all this but im not too sure where.  I already have a desk being set up for me at Linda's so the minute i get my license i'm ready to go.  I cant believe after all this time i'm going to work with her again!

As far as hanging out goes, I've seen Jen Shapiro like all the time now and her male counterparts from circuit city (I do have to say for the hot week I've been hanging out with them they are funny fuckin guys. Much love to them).  I really couldnt tell you what happened to my other friends...sometimes people just disappear for a bit i guess.  I hang out with everyone tho...bc i like to..which bothers some people but I dont like discriminating for stupid ass reasons.  Last night, Phil and Jen and I even met up with Nicole and Sal for a bit.  It was like a mini reunion minus James and Jesse (we all know how in love James is so im sure he was with the gf and well Jesse...we all know what happened with him!).  Rumor is Jay is back on the island for good...I'm not too sure if he'll ever talk to me again but Phil is gonna try to call him.  To think one of the old Best Buy crew is married and has a kid! Which reminds me...I met some1 I know from like 8th grade and she too is married with a kid.  I'm not saying i want to be married and having a kid yet but jeez everyone else is getting all domestic and set up...where'd i go wrong?  I mean contrary to popular belief I'm pretty content with things in my life, theres one or 2 things i'd change but even as i try to do it now it really does suck and im not so sure I should go on with changing things.  I really think I should move soon tho...just to get away from the people around me.  My mom told me to go for it...she understands exactly how i feel and why.  It's kinda hard to pick up and go somewhere and start when u dont have much to begin with tho.  Thats y i am just being an advocate to go away for a bit.  I've been takin care of my sick uncle and have been begging him to take me to Europe with him.  Hell i'll take west bumble fuck PA right now. lol

The weirdest thing happened...I woke up and have the worse knee pain...like its out of its socket or something.  I may be going shopping with Jessica later (erics gf) so if that happens I cant wait to see me hopping around the mall! I have no invigorating plans this weekend but i guess thats always likely to change.  My friggen knee hurts alot and i have to go torture my mom with it! I'll be back later...maybe


You know you love me"

See i told you all i was evil...I will end up in the 2nd level of hell..Can't complain tho, i mean it so could be worse.  And as you can tell if i dont end up there I will end up in one of the other ones that i scored VERY HIGH on....which is alot of them.....when did i become so fucked up? lol

And bc my 2 very best friends took this quiz i took it also...

doesnt she like help her bf kill people? sweet....

Anyway, I'm going to update people on news...for example: My brother goes to PS 36 and its in the paper that a 3rd grader took out a knife on a kindergarten student.  Explain that to me.  How come the 3rd grader didnt know any better and what the hell is this world coming to?? THIRD GRADE...thats my bro's age!! come to think of it i wonder if it's one of his friends.....

ok heres another..the Peterson case...now the prosecutors are saying he's a liar (well no shit there buddy).  For anyone who doesnt know (you must have been living under a rock) Scott Peterson is accused of killing his 8mnth pregnant wife...and the evidence is holding up quite well i might add despite the defense saying some1 is trying to frame him..anyway so the courts are trying to prove he was planning on fleeing by saying how he dyed his hair and bought a mercedes under his moms name...i thought the following excerpt was quite humorous.  It's from the dealer who sold him the car. 
``When I saw the name Jacqueline, I said, 'Are you buying this for your wife?' And he said, 'No, that's my name,''' Griffin testified. ``I said, 'Are you French?' He said, 'No, it's kind of a 'Boy Named Sue' type of thing ... I go by Jack.''' 
Ok wouldnt the smart lie be ""im buying it for my mom"" God damn..if ur gonna kill some1 cover ur damn bases u moron!

And finally...and please excuse me Gabby bc i am gonna be a dork right now....The highlight of my week.  Mt. Saint Helen is getting ready to erupt!!!! I cannot express my amazement and awe at this event...and i will sure to find some way to show pics.  In fact it erupted twice yesterday..albeit just volcanic ash..but they say it will erupt with magma within 2wks or so...can u imagine? Yes im a freak...i would love to witness it!
So here is the latest 

http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/10/05/mount.st.helens.ap/index.html

Humor my geekdom and read it...or at least look at the picture bc its insane....
And on that note be4 gabby starts in on what a loser i am for talking about this volcano 24/7, be back later

"event","I've been trying to figure out exactly what to do with myself. What i really want to do is move away for a little bit...but that kind of means you need to have money and while I'm sure the rents will help me out I'd rather be able to do it on my own.  I think a change of scenery and people would be good for me tho.  Well since I can't just pick up and go and leave everything I figured I need to get motivated to get my life 2gether anyway.  So this past weekend I did alot of thinking (finding out things about the people aroud me helped a bit too) and I think I'm gonna go 4 my real estate license.  I'm good at selling and i know the business and you can make a shit load of money.  Even better, I can go back to school and work still.  So i spent my night looking at grad schools and stuff...of course i ended up looking into law schools...ended up kicking myself in the ass for not doing better in college and opened my LSAT book again so I can retake the test and get a grade that i KNOW i can get.  The problem with me is, I get lazy, so i can't help but wonder how long is this new working my ass off again gonna last for.  Isnt that horrible? Well regardless, something needs to be done sooner or later so I'm sure even if this wears off it'll just come right back.  Right now I am content taking this one day at a time, even if it means changing my mind every few hours..lol...and cursing reading comprehension...i think im the only person who thinks it is the worse part of the LSAT.  Love the logic, hate the reading...which is odd since i do love reading!

This weekend wasnt too eventful...I think the highlight was heather taking me to her friend steve's house.  Now, steve's house is the house of gay men which was fuckin hysterical.  Much love to heather and her friends.  I went shopping with the girls this weekend too...didnt find a damn thing which is so sad.  I did find a $140 pocketbook i want tho!  Its a shame im so cheap!  We also did lunch at Fresca's on sunday...love that place, oceanview and good food...what more can u ask for?  I WAS suppose to go to the movies on sunday night but phil kinda bailed on me.  I want to say that i then went to bed early and had a good sleep.  Didn't happen.  I stood up watching tv all night then ended up not being able to sleep until really late.     

I'm sitting here watching my favorite show, csi miami...they just got a new CSI to replace speedle..I dont know how i feel about him yet.  I'm sure u'll hear more on that later..so now is the time for me to return my attention back to my show...more 2 come later
TTFN

"event","ok so I'm finally gonna update and not with just quiz bs...im talking real deal bs! lol You may be seeing some different things going on with this....that's bc i actually paid for it!!! So now i have these HOT angelina jolie icons....shes one of the women on my list that i would sleep with.  Also, for OBVIOUS reasons people got comment happy on my journal so i chose to screen them all...this probably wont last long bc im lazy and rather just let you all talk and watch the drama unfold (And there is always the delete button!), but for now be patient with the comments and i am sure if u comment i will put it up...if i even know that u comment! lol

It was quite a weekend...friday i partied with the cousin and the band.  Then on saturday, gettin ready for the shock, Lauren Vishiano, Eric and I finally went out!!!!! we took eric's friend ezekiel to the city along with Jessica (eric;s gf) and Kim.  It was fun...well in the beginning..we went bar hopping and shit. Met some cool people.  The night ended badly...real badly...but thats not a topic i want to advertise at this or any point in time.  We did run into Steven tho, Lauren's ex and my...i want to say friend but i dont even know if he gets that title so we'll say acquaintence who was once a best friend(?).  Shout out to my girl Lauren---""VEEEEBRATOR""!!!

2day also turned out interesting...went for sangria sunday with the girls--who i hardly get to see anymore bt school with allison and gabby chillin with her ""practically engaged"" bf...much love to u guys! I miss ya!  Went to A&W with koch too...ran into crazy eddie who gave me lots of little funny tid bits bout mike and gerard.  Speaking of gerard, the ghost came out of hiding and i FINALLY got to speak with him (its been like what a month?!?!).  He's seeing some chic with a hawiian name like Kiki..wait that is her name i think.  Whatever.  Let's see how long he sticks around be4 he disappear agains...regardless...heres my shout out to him--lots of love even tho i hate u ;-)

So my weekend involved hanging out with EVERYONE i havent seen in ages...I even talked to Planco a little but he doesnt really care bout anyone but himself lately or mayve he does and he just has funny ways of showing it. He's always been an odd boy! He doesnt read this so i can say that bout him...still love the kid, we're just not that good of friends anymore..it happens

Oh my god--i hung out with cheryl too on thurs! Now thats another story...i'm in an attempt to see why we didnt talk in the 1st place but I'm not getting very far on that. 

Heather is having a halloween party for her bday (yes ive been with her 24/7 too).  I so cannot wait...i'm still in the mist of costume shopping.  My gripe with that tho is that u cant try on or open the packages of the costumes....AND THEN U CANT RETURN OR EXCHANGE!!!! does that make any sense??? It truly angers me!

Ok well now I needed to have one of these....FETUS FETUS (hehe that was for u gabby)

<h2>Your Celebrity Threesome: Gisele Bundchen and Leonardo DiCaprio</h2>
You will never settle for anything less than perfection when it comes to looks...

And being able to share a bed with two perfect ten's makes your life absolutely blissful. 

You don't mind if your partner is always being stared at and romanticized about. 

As long as you have them all to yourself (and if they don't develop body acne or something gross like that), there are no problems.

"event","Today started slow...but then it just became a really really good day.  

Jen and I went to lunch and spent quality time 2gether.  I finally taught Jen how to read this do-jammy so she will be update on current events! Welcome Jen! ;-) Our lunch put me in a relatively good mood.  Then I came home and annoyed the rents...which we all know I'm always up for!  I honestly dont know why today was a good day...I'm just relatively in a good mood, which is odd especially since for like a split 1/2 hour there i lost my temper and went ballistic.  I guess weirder things have happened..

My friend Danny has been working like crazy on a marketing thing so here my good luck to him.  GOOD LUCK, much love to you and I'll let you rule the world with me!!!

2morrow my pictures will finally get developed! I am beyond excited bout this! You will probably hear about them in great detail!

Now the real reason why I have this journal entry up....
Are you ready for it??

ok here it comes....

I finally got to see Degrassi and O'grady...Alli's 2 favorite shows.  And I love it..especially O'grady...absolutely in love with it. So i did the natural thing...took the Which o'grady character are you?
<a href=""http://www.the-n.com/games/quiz/1372""><img src=""http://www.the-n.com/media/quiz/badges/ogrady/abby.gif"" border=""0"" /></a>


HEHE. I'm so easily pleased! 

Well its time to read some more...I started reading the ""notebook""...its not a greatly written book but there is something about it that makes me completely drawn to it.  I think this is the 1st night in months I am home be4 2 and hopefully will be in bed be4 4!!! Wish me luck!

""catch you on the flip side...""

<P>So I never discussed the night Gabby and I went out like 2 wks ago.&nbsp; So I'll give it to you in the abridged version...ok so we go to this place called bar 13 (still waiting for the pictures to come back) and its open bar so we both get loaded.&nbsp; &nbsp; We meet some guy named Jon (cute guy works at vh1) and he's like ""ok everyone party at my place"" which turned out being in jersey city.&nbsp; So the morons that we are, we go.&nbsp; We get there and there are, no joke, like 10 rastafarians partying on the roof with like a full bar, and crazy food.&nbsp; They start serving us shrimp and chicken and everything you can think of.&nbsp; Gabby and I leave at like 5 in the morning and we dont get home till like 6:30. Why you ask? bc we get lost in jersey city.&nbsp; So here I am driving her car, lost...Gabby went so far as to call Gerard's cell at 5:30 screaming ""we need your gps! U fucker get up!"" amoung other obscenities.&nbsp; We eventually got home and passed out and I am still waiting for cvs to give me my friggen pictures back!!! Once they are here I'll link it to Gabby thing-a-ma-bob when she downloads them so all can see.</P>
<P>So that was it in a nutshell..it's funny actually hearing the details but I'm too lazy to go thru it.&nbsp; And my laziness has now compelled me to go lay down some more.&nbsp; So this is me leaving you....peace</P>"

"event","It's been awhile but I return with a comical entry for all of you.  Here is the background: Jesse is a dear friend of mine and is forbidden to hang out with me bc of his gf.  Recently, I was informed by Planco that they had a mutual friend who died so I emailed him my condolences (its the nice thing to do ya know?).  He wasnt there but his psycho bitch was...so here..read the following.  It's long but its worth it and the people who know who this girl is will enjoy it more than anyone..

truElibrA27 (1:41:09 PM): Thanks but this is not Jesse so why don't you go away like you should ahve a long time ago
truElibrA27 (1:41:11 PM): have
HIGHNESS82 (1:41:55 PM): oh jeez i was saying im sorry his friend died...lighten the fuck up
truElibrA27 (1:42:03 PM): U think I don't know about how he came over cause you poor girls didn't know how to open a wine bottle
(Pause it's me and expect my comments...Gabby imed jesse to come over and open wine for us as i was in the shower, so i didnt know...he actually came! and stood well past 4am. His choice to come btw and was my best friend all night)

HIGHNESS82 (1:42:12 PM): i dont care
truElibrA27 (1:42:34 PM): Maybe one day you take a step back and wonder why people's girlfriends can;t stand you
truElibrA27 (1:42:43 PM): it's cause of your attitude
HIGHNESS82 (1:42:48 PM): bc they are psychotic cunts like u?
truElibrA27 (1:42:57 PM): the same reason why Jesse could care less to be your friend anymore
truElibrA27 (1:43:12 PM): Guess he had to see for himself what a ""cunt"" you are
truElibrA27 (1:43:21 PM): too bad he's too nice to say it to you
HIGHNESS82 (1:43:30 PM): yea but he was nice enough to come over here wasnt he?
HIGHNESS82 (1:43:36 PM): get over urself 
truElibrA27 (1:43:40 PM): He now realizes how you have no regard for anyone else
truElibrA27 (1:43:50 PM): you should get over yourself and show some respect
HIGHNESS82 (1:43:52 PM): not true..just u
truElibrA27 (1:44:02 PM): Well because you act that way
truElibrA27 (1:44:13 PM): he will not bother with you anymore
HIGHNESS82 (1:44:20 PM): i dont have respect for immature fuckin bitches who think who the hell they are and that people will cower to them 
truElibrA27 (1:44:36 PM): Well you shouldn't have fucked with my relationship
(I fucked with a relationship and didnt even know it! go me!)

truElibrA27 (1:44:42 PM): just because yours is in the toilet
truElibrA27 (1:44:59 PM): Phil was too good for you anyway
truElibrA27 (1:45:02 PM): too nice and too mature
(ok now crossing a line..no one talks bout me and phil whether we are 2gether or not, especially under circumstances.  so now i will proceed to flip bc this fatty tried shoving her 2 sense in)

HIGHNESS82 (1:45:05 PM): u fuckin bitch..u dont knwo a damn fuckin thing about my relaqtionship..ididnt fuck with anyones relationship
HIGHNESS82 (1:45:08 PM): ur a jealous fuck

truElibrA27 (1:45:20 PM): hahah
HIGHNESS82 (1:45:22 PM): bc we trusted each other
truElibrA27 (1:45:25 PM): that's so funny
HIGHNESS82 (1:45:27 PM): u dont have that
HIGHNESS82 (1:45:44 PM): u cry whenever ur bf goes out without u
truElibrA27 (1:45:45 PM): I'm not the one touching phil's thighs at parties
truElibrA27 (1:45:57 PM): or calling him late at night to hang out
(i was unaware i was touching anyones thighs...but calling..yea im guilty as charged and they come to.....hmmm)

HIGHNESS82 (1:46:10 PM): yea bc he might vomit if u did
(true statement btw)

truElibrA27 (1:46:10 PM): because you should respect other people's relationships
truElibrA27 (1:46:27 PM): ha that's why jesse thinks you are hairy and repulsive
HIGHNESS82 (1:46:27 PM): u have no right to fuckin speak about me and phil
truElibrA27 (1:46:38 PM): not to mention need to hit that gym a little more
HIGHNESS82 (1:46:50 PM): LOL> me?? UR A FUCKIN MAN
(ok so now she calls me hairy and fat..hello i live with my razor and im way thinner than her...i think she was looking in the mirror when she tried insulting me...)

truElibrA27 (1:47:35 PM): ever wonder why jesse hasn;t talked to you since that night
truElibrA27 (1:47:44 PM): cause he put you on block
truElibrA27 (1:47:50 PM): cause he cant stand you anymore
HIGHNESS82 (1:47:52 PM): good
HIGHNESS82 (1:47:54 PM): im glad
truElibrA27 (1:47:57 PM): good for me
HIGHNESS82 (1:48:04 PM): bc if he is stupid enough to listen to u i dont want him as a friend
(dear jesse, Im very sorry u feel the way u do and let ur gf tell u how to act and feel...i do hope things go well for u in life and u find the strength to live ur own life..I'll always be here as ur friend despite popular belief)

HIGHNESS82 (1:48:18 PM): tell him im sorry james died 
HIGHNESS82 (1:48:19 PM): and end it now
truElibrA27 (1:48:20 PM): Well you don;t respect me

truElibrA27 (1:49:05 PM): but just so you know
HIGHNESS82 (1:49:06 PM): and he knows u didnt
(her trying involves flipping if jesse talks to females or hangs out with them..no trust..not my problem)

truElibrA27 (1:49:19 PM): he really doesn't want anything to do with you
HIGHNESS82 (1:49:27 PM): ok good..im glad can u go now?

HIGHNESS82 (1:52:52 PM): keep justifying urself..u need to sit here and tell me to make urself feel good thats fine ...im not in the mood for this

HIGHNESS82 (1:54:58 PM): well yeas it is holier than thou isnt it? i guess i just know how to be a good person

HIGHNESS82 (1:57:03 PM): and ps ever talk about mea nd phil again ur fuckin dead

HIGHNESS82 (1:57:10 PM): have a nice life send jesse my love
truElibrA27 (1:57:17 PM): you are so funny 4 eyes what are you gonna do
(oohh a glasses hit...haha)

HIGHNESS82 (1:57:30 PM): true u might eat me...
truElibrA27 (1:57:35 PM): Remember I am psycho
truElibrA27 (1:57:39 PM): yeah that's it
truElibrA27 (1:57:46 PM): I probably weigh less than you now
truElibrA27 (1:57:56 PM): and I'm sorry ms. rolly pollie
(the fat jokes again...lol..told u it was funny)

HIGHNESS82 (1:58:00 PM): yea i know u are psycgo..at least u admit it

HIGHNESS82 (1:58:20 PM): what are we 10
truElibrA27 (1:58:53 PM): I don't care go rot somewhere and suck planko's dick
(this kinda baffled me..it could be bc i mentioned him earlier and she thinks im a slut for hanging out with boys who arent my bf.  When phil and i were 2gether he didnt care and didnt think i was a slut and last i checked i wasnt....so she took one of my best guy friends and made a comment..original isnt it?)

truElibrA27 (1:58:58 PM): see yah
HIGHNESS82 (1:59:06 PM): nah i dont think im in the mood for that
HIGHNESS82 (1:59:15 PM): maybe some other time
HIGHNESS82 (1:59:24 PM): but im sure ur just gonna go dyke out with ur friends
(i hear its popular in her group of friends)

HIGHNESS82 (1:59:29 PM): so think of me while u do it ok?
truElibrA27 (1:59:31 PM): yup bye sexy
truElibrA27 (1:59:46 PM): anytime your hairy mustache is such a turn on
HIGHNESS82 (1:59:59 PM): mm..yes but not as much as ur rolls
HIGHNESS82 (2:00:01 PM): bye sweetie
truElibrA27 (2:00:25 PM): haha cyah, well I wont and jesse neither, good riddance
truElibrA27 (2:00:31 PM): ;-)
HIGHNESS82 (2:00:44 PM): :-P

And there u have it...I thought it was fuckin hysterical when i reread it. Alli made some nice comments 2, for example: ""telll her shes sick in the head and u and jesse were FRIENDS and shes making it up and if it wasnt amanda it  would be some1 else cause she insecure"" and ""u wanted 2 tell jesse ur condolences for a deceased friend and this is what she does when u try 2 do that cause she's selfish"".  Gotta love her...she calls it like she sees it
So i hope u all enjoyed this entry..I know I DID!

On a less comical note, I have a bbq goin on at my house 2day and ur all invited! Come and party and maybe if ur lucky i'll write on this dojammy when im loaded! I should have been dressed an hour ago but obviously i got sidetracked..so call the house
TTFN
You KNOW you love me..."

"event","Ok updating...and reading everyone else's journal...give me 10 minutes....ok done..and here we go....  


The events of the past week have been...well just down right irritating.  Now don't get me wrong, it's pretty much over now.  But it was just irritating in general.

For those of you who know, Alli and I got into somewhat of a tiff..ok so it was pretty big.  It's all good now.  What most people do NOT realize is that we're friends and friends fight, correct?  And no matter how angry I was or upset I always said it would be squashed.  I do not like any type of fight with anyone ESPECIALLY one of my very bestest friends. It makes me down right ill.  So I'm sorry after years of fighting with her and putting up with each other's shit (bc hey lets face it I'm no angel), yes, things are peachy keen for us again! For people who do not understand that I do not know what to tell you except if there is a problem and it bothers you that much tell me...I'm pretty sure I'm an okay person to talk to and I would LOVE to know when everyone got so afraid to say ANYTHING to me.  

Ok side note, THE STAY PUFF MARSHMELLOW MAN JUST DIED IN THE GHOSTBUSTERS MOVIE!!  I am really upset now! He is my favorite! And they kill him!! The 1st time I saw this movie and realized he was in it for like point 5 seconds and then died I almost cried!  Such bull shit....

Ok continueing on...Last night, I was suppose to be going out with Gabby but she totally bitched out on me (thanks alot there).  So i had to go to this house party still (which btw gab everyone asked for you) and i didnt want to go alone so i dragged allison...which is funny bc it was chris' house party and they werent too fond of one another.  They got along quite nicely tho (i knew they would).  I saw some people I havent seen in a while there..ie Swanson, which is always interesting.  His gf isnt a nice person..but whatever.  So we basically pregamed at Chris' be4 going to KJs to see Colin's band, LaLas basement.  It is here Jen Koch joins us and we run into Gabby's ex's friends, who in the 3 yrs of their relationship we rarely saw.  So we had a good time hanging out with Jojo and Matt and this kid Mike for a bit.  Tom, Gab's ex, made an appearance but he seemed quite nasty (no offense there but you were Tom).  And he left shortly without saying goodbye (see? not nice..it was like pulling teeth to get a proper hello. I just didnt feel love by you man!).  Anyway, Eric came and hung out with us for a bit too and then Al and I ate and went home.  Hey now that I read this it's like night of bitchy people..whats up with that?  Even in a bad mood, I'm fun to be with bc I'll just abuse everyone! Enjoy your misery and your pain...contrary to popular belief it is ok to be that way...just not to waste your fuckin life away bc of it.  Yea so thats all I have to say bout that...


So 2night I am suppose to go to the city with Gabby for her friend's bday party.  I have a feeling this is gonna prove to be interesting....I probably shouldnt get too drunk for this.  But the open bar is just so tempting...

Gotta get to a bank and clean my car...Catch you all later
Kisses"

"event","Holy shit I wrote a whole entry and accidently hit a button and boom its gone.  I'm guessing god is trying to tell me not to write in this thing...but we see how well I'm listening...

""For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!""

So after a miserable week here i am!  Everything that has gone on in the past few months came to a complete head this week (well kinda), forcing me to go back on my tummy medicine.  That might not be a bad thing tho since I was never suppose to be off of it.  As always, I will not get into great detail even though I have been told I have a gift of ""talking through things"" (now why cant i have a gift of like mind reading or super sonic hearing?)(also how is it that talking bout things is a good thing when 90 percent of the pop doesnt do it??).  I dunno..its all weird.  Everyone knows I dont break down normally but I guess it's time i did.  The ""one day at a time"" quote can shove itself up someone's ass now.  ;-)  And the bad news just keeps on coming to me! What can I say? ""it was the best of times, it was the worse of times..."" And boy were they bad! lol

Enough of the dreary and melancholy and grey, hows it going?  Lets talk about happy fun things bc lets face it being miserable and nasty just does not help in becoming a happy person and I am so not that dreary person!  So this weekend, shocks beyond shocks, I hung out with Eric.  We were at his aunts block party (yes in the rain and all) then hung out at tiffany's afterwards.  Tiffany accidently hit my car during the winter and was apologizing about that which was nice of her.  I told her not to worry tho bc she paid and it's over with.  I'm not one to hold a grudge..I have better things to do with my life.  Besides, I liked hanging out with them the other night.  From there, I was at beer gardens to see my cousin Christina and meet the guy shes seeing.  Hes the owner of Danoi and hes abosultely adorable.  Her female friend that was there was alittle weird.  I think she has a thing for my cousin but then again almost the everyone the Chris comes in contact with does!  At bagel bistro at like 3am i made friends with some weird kid from Philadelphia (and no i didnt get his social security #!).  You know me...I make friends with everyone!  

I happened to talk to jen kateman this week too (everyone is coming out of no where all of a sudden!)...in honor of that here is a shout out to her...good luck in Ithaca this yr... she will be finishing her schooling there. 

I saw AVP this weekend too...that was pretty good. They left it open for yet another sequel..SURPRISE! Like no one saw that coming!

The boys are running around the house like loons and here I am typing this.  To be honest, I just dont want to type no more bc I typed so much since this is my fuckin SECOND ENTRY!!! I wonder how i deleted the other one in the 1st place.  Now I must go save my dogs bc they are bothering the boys...TTFN


Ps Gabby picked out my mood..so if you don't know what it means bc ur not english majors like us, here is your definition---spiritless, being or appearing lifeless...But gabby says to look it up bc people dont know anything anymore..I'm nice tho so I am giving you the def.  Unlike her, I know you learn nothing in college and those SAT words are oh so far away... The word listless was also considered...If u dont know what that means look that one up...I'm not that nice!

You know you love me"

"event","Well hello there.  I figure it's been long enough since I wrote in this thing and I wante everyone to know I'm still alive and well.  When things...real personal things that truly upset me..go on in my life, I just don't type it bc--well, lets face it---it's none of your business and I refuse to advertise the things in my life that really matter.  These journal things suddenly got attention seeking and woe is me bull shit.  As things in my life go on, you will be informed but not in play by play form bc you are just better off not knowing.

So now the updates--it's no secret anymore,as hard as it is, so I can just admit that Phil and I lack the title of a couple...for you morons, we just aren't 2gether anymore.  Theres always hope tho.  We are still friends and shit..in fact I think I see him more now then I did when we a couple the last few months. lol.  Sometimes people just need space.  But he still came to sunny Florida with me...I love florida.  It's so fuckin nice out there.  I liked it so much I came home and started looking for law schools down there!  (lets see if i have the balls to move there tho).  We had a pretty good vacation.  Allison and her mommy came down too and we got loaded a few times.  All i have to say to them is ""the green grass grows all around all around..the green grass grows all around"".  I miss being there.  The pictures from there are hysterical.  

I got home on saturday and went to mike's for a bit with gabs, alli and gerard.  The next week ended up being a week of surprises, stupid things but nonetheless surprises.  Nicole's memorial mass was on the 5th as it is every year.  Gabby and I went.  I went to see harold and kumar go to white castle and now i realize, as funny as the movie was, you can make a movie about absolutely anything!  I also got to see Anto, Planco and Koch...which is down right weird since I've hardly talked to them in months.  I attempted to drink with them...i think i started at like 130 and by 215 I was loaded...which makes no sense bc i didnt drink that much.  Last night gabby and i were here and wanted to drink wine....well turns out we dont know how to open bottles of wine so gabby started petitioning people on my buddy list to come and help us (where was allison you ask? well she hurt her toe, possiblely broke it.  She wasn't in the mood to talk to people from what I can tell so I let her be.  But she was missed!!).  The oddest person ended up agreeing to come...and i say odd bc I swore this person would never step in my house again (for safety reasons all names are kept confidential..lol).  Regardless the bottles of wine were opened which was absolutely clutch.

Well i need to go get my bro at camp...Ill be back...eventually..lol"

"event","It's been awhile but HIII! Last night, alli and I hauled ass to Danny Boys to watch my cousin's (Paulette) bf's (Colin) band play.  THe band is called LaLa's basement and lets just say HELLO LENNY THE LEAD SINGER!! Anyway, so they are pretty good and sing lots of covers and stuff.  George, Jay (the adopted cousin) and Chris were there too.  I got shitfaced thanks to some green shot the lead singer was gibing out for free and my one and only true love...BLACK HAUS!  Mike and Gerard came too but Gerard disappeared at like 12 and didnt resurface till like 4am (the asshole went to go repark his car and fell asleep in it...i swear hes a narcoleptic).  Koch and Toniann came too....Brian ur a dick for not calling your gf.  Alli, Mike and I dropped my car off at al's house and took her car to drive around the rest of the night.  Poor Allison is having a conniption with her puppy lately bc hes annoyin and young and needs to be taken care of 24/7 cause her rents are away.  He's driving her up a wall.  I didnt get home till after 5 and I've been up since like 11...I should so be sleeping.  Little memories of things I did last night are coming back to me and I wasnt even that drunk to 4get.  I have been sober for 3wks...oops. lol

Well i need to get dressed.  Since I am up I might as well do something with my life...

"event","ok so here's a quick run down of part 2...i really dont feel up to typing it but I figured I can't leave the world hanging.

So Phil, the greatest guy, comes and picks me and gabby up at the ferry. My lovely friends are practically home already in a nice warm car, calling me to find out where I am which makes me more angry bc I just PTed my ass home.  Allison now calls and goes ""no one is going to spirit"".  Spirit is the club me and gabby bought tickets for.  Now, I'm even more livid.  Don't get me wrong..I'm not stupid enough not to go without them...I learned they are unreliable fucks, and I was going regardless of them.  That wasn't the point tho.  I call grunhaus and he tells me the same.  In a fit of absolute anger, I tell him very sweetly that I'm about to curse him out so he better talk to gabby.  Same shit.  We get to my house and my rents chew me out like u wouldnt believe (mostly for my outfit).  After 20 minutes, I made a nice little speech telling them I was sorry and all this bs.  Now john calls and hes like ""whats wrong"".  I think i would have cried if I could have....anyway, he feels bad for me.  By some miracle of god he gets the group to go to the club w/o being fucked up.  We are now in gabbys car driving...in nice DRY clothes...HER FUCKIN CEILING LEAKS ON ME!!!  The boys also failed to tell me they ddnt have tickets to the club and had to pay 40 dollars each.  Oh and gabby who had a ticket was told her ticket was fake and almost couldnt get in.

The club itself sucked.  There are absolutely no seats.  I ended up sitting out side with the smoking people on concrete.  I threw up on gabby too (only water but still). Lets just say by the time i left I was exhausted so i passed out in the car, got home and slept till like 6 the next day.

I caught a cold from this awful night.  And i blame it on the rain. I'm sure this would be a very funny story if i wasn't still hurting from spending so much money and my nose wasnt stuffy.  Did i mention one of the guys we hung out with bit me?? yea ok for some reason he has a habbit of biting me...I really dont know why.  But that was another thing I was like ""what the hell"" to.

The rest of the weekend that followed wasn't exactly peachy for other reasons.  As well as the next few days.  On a brighter note, Gabby and I (after i realized I lost 20 dollars) went out to the sandbar and kjs last night.  We went to the sandbar to shock the hell out of a very old and distant friend, chris.  I totally succeeded in doing that.  Then we went to KJs where we saw diane and a couple other people.  All in  all it was a pretty good time.  Gabby is still sleeping on my bed....this is the girl who wakes me at like 10am everyday and SHE is still sleeping!

Well its time for me to get food...I went back on my diet.  10 more lbs to go! oh yea and guess what?? Phil, who is still coming to FL with me, and I are being joined @ disney with ALLISON!!!!! Her and her mom got tics and are coming down!  This is gonna be absolutely insane! Can't wait.

"event","well hello there...
If you haven't had the luxury of reading gabbys journal then it is up to me to fill you in on the events of the weekend and how not worth it the weekend was.

Friday: Ah yes...PVD! I have missed this guy play every time he came to NY...the last time bc my asshole guy friends are lying bastards.  But this time---this time I'm going and it's gonna be insane! So the plan is go to central park and hear him play then go to spirit and hear him play some more and have one hell of an night...yea well i did have one.  The day begins with drama from the boys end bc they are shitty ass ""candy"" users and have a shitty ass ""candy"" dealer.  John has to drive to the city and drive home after central park so he can do a pick up.  Alli, Gabs and I decide to PT it regardless.  Even though I am trying to figure out what is going on, I can't bc they keep putting Jen on the phone with me and well I KNOW she has no clue what the guys are doing so I am slowly getting pissed.  Ok whatever..we go and there is a monsoon!! I lost my shoe in the street (got it back tho) and gabby did one of those feet over head and falling on her ass bit.  Mind you we are in skirts...light colors at that (ie white and beiges and pinks)!! We laugh bout this on the subway, gabby buys a 5 dollar umbrella (which paul breaks later, leaving us umbrellaless) and we get to PVD.  It is soooooo wet and cold tho!  I think my body temp went down so much that Alaska might've been eqivalent to it.  After bout an hour we cant take anymore..so gabby and I leave with the impression that everyone else is staying longer.  Why would they do that tho? they left 20 minutes after us in NICE WARM CARS!!! While gabby and i struggled on the ferry...ah the ferry.  It bugged me out big time.  And thats when God sent the 13 yr old missionaries from michigan to have conversations with me.  They wouldnt stop talking! So gabby was the nice one and talked to them.  Then we get off the boat and some nigerian guard is following me and gabby thinking we are 15 yr old twins! So i had fun with this one and told him i was 25 and had a kid and shit and gabby was my cousin who is gettin her mba in nyu.  During these freezing times, I call phil...you know the boy I've been with for 5 years who just mutually decided w/ me to take a break...and say ""hi if u ever loved me you will come get me at the ferry with gabby!!"".  Phil being my absolute best friend and saint/savior comes and gets us...

ok this gets better and I have to get dressed to bring adam to basketball and joey to baseball...so...

"event","Gabby came over and had lunch with me 2day then we proceeded to shop @ menlo.  I bought a cute tank and skirt for PVD for friday and some nice smelling body sprys and stuff.  I think I blew away like 120 dollars but shopping is strangely comforting to a girl.  I also went to cheesecake factory..it was my 1st time in this one.  I didn't drink any alcohol bc I don't think gettin drunk is a good idea right now..but I had an AMAZING brownie and ice cream sandwich.  This was fuckin huge! I couldn't even eat it.  Gabby had an oreo cheesecake which i plan on ordering for my self one night...me, oreo cheesecake and some really bad bitch flick...sounds like a plan for a few nights.  

I also talked to my old managers from express (the women's managers).  I figured it was time I let go of the anger, ya know?  G should still die but I give up on hating the rest of them..even if some are annoying.  I don't have the energy for it and you really never know who you may need in the future.  I guess you can say it's time for me to grow up and find my niche in life...and if that means kissing the asses of people i normally wouldnt then so be it.

The migraine from hell finally left me--thanks to excedrin migraine.  It was so bad! Last night, to go to sleep easier I left the TV on so my mind wouldn't wonder, ya know?  The episode of ""who's the boss"" came on where Tony walks in on Angela naked in the bath...It made me think of the episode of family guy where the neighborhood makes the floats and win the trophy for making a float about that episode.  Ok I have a weird train of thought BUT it was still funny. 

Bc i have nothing to do with myself (yet again), I am either a) gonna clean out my closet b) read  c)vaccuum or d)lay on the couch like the fat fuck I am and think bout life as I watch bad soaps!....And d sounds like a plan!"

"event","This was such a bad day.  Besides Adam being sick, Phil and I were suppose to hang out all day bc we rarely get to see each other and I got to see him for a hot 1/2 hr bc he had to clean his room and I was going out with the girls (he was suppose to come but didn't).  It's totally getting ridiculous with us.  Then I kept cheating on my diet...I bet the 15 lbs I lost are back (btw certain people knocking my diet should actually try it bc they need to lose the weight more than me).  And just when I'm like ""ok ill make the best of this day""---my best friend's gf (oh im sorry I cant call him that anymore...she about to forbid me from talking to him) calls me to straighten out what happened last night...well lets just say telling me how fucked up I am and threatening me isn't the way to do that, especially when I didn't do a damn thing.  So after a very heated arguement...and believe me it takes me a while to get THAT heated (even my mom was surprised) I came home...which is when I got to see Phil for a bit be4 heading to jersey to go to club sleep.  Ah jersey...fuckin assholes.  The club was closed for some reason so we came back to the island where we changed into jeans and did the local thing.  One of our friends were going to meet us but we got stood up (which is becoming this person's MO---seriously, if you aren't coming just say it).  Needless to say, I am very dishearted and aggravated.  All i wanted to do was go out and forget about my bad day..but then someone must've tried putting a hex on me and succeeded (well somewhat..things could be worse).

So on this note, I leave...cursing up a storm and trying not to yell at people.
Wonder who is gonna make me flip 1st...."

Last night (as well as almost every other night) was a girl night again.  I was happily getting loaded, despite little irritations here and there.  (Hi my name is Amanda and I am an alcoholic).  So I come home a little annoyed at some things and I get an im from a friend's gf (who I am kinda friends with) grilling my ass bout her bf (who is a better friend of mine).  Needless to say, I wasn't in the mood so I said I was going to bed. Let's face it no matter what I said would end up in like an hour long talk and I want nothing to do with their relationship (keep your problems to yourself and take it up with each other).  So i went to bed.  But for some reason, I started getting ims from people I did not know...HOW FUCKIN CONVENIENT!  I was passed out during this process though..thank god bc I would've flipped out. But I woke up to these ims and weird people...in fact, one claimed to have known me from my gym.  That's right I go to a women's gym and I pick up the electricians who work there! Who knew? Cause i didn't!  Hell, I didn't even know electricians are there!  I had no problem talking to anyone..I just wasn't in the mood for it at that point in time and there was rudeness and stalking.  When I say leave me alone, how bout we do that until the following morning when I'm ready to????

Gabby and I had a treat yesterday in the form of Paul Cartsens visiting us.  It was a special time for us bc it is so rare when he graces us with his presence.  We <3 you, Paul!!

2night, the awesome 3 (or the dark angels as my cousin calls us) are going to Club Sleep in jersey.  Phil and Hershal are supposed to come but I don't know if they actually will.  I think they have a house party 2morrow in jersey anyway.  

There is now ONE WEEK AND ONE DAY to the PVD concert in central park.  Its going to be total insanity...I cannot wait!  It's actually one of the 1st times I'm hanging out with the Sound factory crew in months.  After the concert, we're going to a club.  The expected time of coming home is like 8am.  You will be hearing about this for the next week!

Ok so it's about time I make sure my sick child is still alive upstairs...TTFN"

"event","Hola...it's another bright morning here.  I've been up since 7am (for the 2nd day in a row).  I really don't know why or understand why my body won't let me sleep but I'm still feeling good.  For the 1st time since god know when, I sat down and had a morning cup of coffee with the rents (me drinking coffee and I don't even like it! Guess you gotta grow up and start drinkin it sooner or later).

So it's been awhile...I've been keepin myself busy with the girlies---bar hopping and being crazy.  Gabby and I finally hung out at Djais, which was pretty cool.  And then the 3 of us have been doing the local shit and other jersey places.  

I really don't know what to do with myself this early in the morning.  I'm sitting here watching ""as good as it gets"" for the 100th time.  Such a cute movie...

Next weekend is eric's grad party.  I'm bringing Gabby as a date. lol.  I'm not too sure how much I am lookin 4ward to this but it's a party and it's for him.  I figure we'll go out afterwards and get my ass loaded or something.  

Speaking of loaded, I was drinking since 2 o'clock yesterday.  Allison took me and gabby to the irish fair.  Then i came home and downed some pina coladas and black haus and then topped off the night at afternoons with a whole bunch of beers.  I was on my ass.  I love those moments. :-P

Well since it is still oh so early, it's time to go back upstairs and bother my parents like I have been doing all morning.  I thought they were gonna die of shock when i walked up stairs with the puppy at 7am.  I have to play team mom at adam's baseball game 2day---which he won't even be at.  It's a fav for my mom.

Ok so this song will not get out of my head...I dont even know why it's in my head.  Last night, Gabs and I met up with people at the iguanna again (do i even spell that right?).  Same crew (ie my cousin and his friends), with a few new people that I made friends with.  This one kid who Gabby knows since we were like 16 named Danny sings the best songs.  I totally live to see him up there singing ""i am woman"" or ""If i had a million dollars"".  It was quite an interesting night--we learned people actually grew up and others found religion.(lol that one is for u G).  Today ended up being a lazy day (again) and bc it was so lazy I choose to sit on my ass.  That always leads to thinking and well me and thinking just is not a good combination sometimes.  I got myself all aggitated over a situation with a certain friend (and no its not Alli or Gabs).  Then I talked to Allison about it and well, her insight is always helpful and fun bc she totally takes my side and understands my confusion! (Thank u hun!).  Not that anyone has any clue what I talking about but this is just me venting to myself about how sucky people are and how I just don't get them...ever.  

Would you believe I'm in a good mood tho?  Lol I didnt think so...Well heres a bright note, my rents are goin to AC on thursday and me and Adam get to stay home.  He goes to bed bout 930ish and then I'll be here with some people---nice, happy and drunk...then up at 7 to get him to school of course! lol.  Oh well, it'll still be fun.  Also on sunday, Gabby and I are heading to Djais where I will be enjoying black haus specials all night---YEA BABY!

We are walkin out of blockbuster and driving home as he tells me this story...At 10am this old jewish man walks into the store.  Now this man has long Kris Kringle beard and shorts on.  He begins talking to phil, and starts trying to discuss the difference bt making love and sex.  My bf must have a sign on him or something bc the man didnt stop and thoroughly freaked phil out.  This old dude begins to tell phil how and where to caress a woman--avoiding her special no no place (the man actually meant to say ""genitals"" but said ""generals"").  Then he tells him to go to a cheap deli and buy baby oil so you can, and i quote ""sqirt some up there"".  Phil is trying to walk away but this weird man wouldn't let him and begins to talk anal and tell him how to expand the hole...wait here is where I begin to go into a fit of tears from laughing so hard...He puts his hand up in the air and shows phil THE SHOCKER.  Phil, now thoroughly disturbed, is still looking for ways to get away. Alas, the man begins to not only tells phil the RIGHT way to do it (theres a wrong way?) but gives a history lesson--it was originally called the ""grand slam"".  The man conintues to discuss things such as his daughters having sex and him having sex with his daughter's friends and the secret to sex (phil tried to walk away but the man pulled him by his tie!!!)--boys, wanna know the secret to sex??? According to old jewish man, it's peeing....yup...hold ur pee.  Oh that and learning how to zone out and still smile at the woman like ur interested (thats during sex).  Now there was much more detail to this, but #1 I will never be able to tell it as well as phil. #2 I dont know who reads this and dont want to cross a line and #3 some of it is just down right gross.  So for all you people who wonder how i attract the weird ones, now i hope you wonder how phil does it and more importantly why the man followed him to tell him all this info. lol.  My poor baby..."

"event","To say that this weekend blew is such an understatement....not one damn night went good.  Everything planned was completely fucking ruined.  And it totally sucks bc everyone else had some bitchin weekend.  Gabby and I were gonna go to the shore 2night (to make up for last night) but I wasn't up to fighting traffic at 1030pm after driving back from PA in it with the fam. So we stood local (dragging koch along for the ride).  2night actually wasn't horrible...it just wasn't good either....I'm just totally frustrated and cannot wait for next weekend to make it all up.  And if things don't go my way next weekend I am so moving to another state and not leaving a forwarding address.  It's all bull shit and added frustration I just don't want or need....Florida/North Carolina/some-tropical-island-off-the-coast-of-south-america here I come!!!

On a side and a much happier note to me, the cousins come over to meet adam for the 1st time 2morrow.  But with my luck, the 3 of them get here and it's like a total disaster (cross ur fingers that it's not).  I got to see Aunt Wilma's house 2day (hence the drive to PA).  It's pretty nice...I just don't like being out in western guam but then again if you think about it, it does have some appeals...It's actually in a very nice neighborhood and they actually have neighbors (holy shit I said the word actually way too much).  PA just doesn't do it for me...maybe bc if I move I want 24/7 sun (uhhem--south america?).

So 2morrow should be good..i hope..lol.  Either way, I get to see Phil at the end of the night which will hopefully make me feel better.  I haven't seen him in 2 days--in other words I blew him off for a weekend that sucked ass.  Guess it served me right. lol.  No no it didnt, but I'll pretend like it does.  (u know u love me babe!)

Ok enough bitching and more sleeping...."

We also got to chill with Chris and Paulette (the cousins) which was cool. The 2 idiots (and i say idiot in a loving way) got kicked out of iguanna for bringing dunken doughnut coffee in...well in their defense the owner was being a dick.  But I say it's totally funny bc I can say my cousins got kicked out of the iguanna and I still got to enjoy their company.  Gabs and I went shopping.  We had these gret plans for menlo, target and woodbridge...we got as far as menlo.  For many, many reasons, the menlo mall drains me.  And not only was I tired, Gabby was too.  So we went home and i saw SHREK 2!! OMG I LOVE IT.  I took phil for his study break.  PUSS IN BOOTS IS THE BEST PART OF THAT MOVIE! GINGERBREAD MAN KICKS ASS!! (can u guess what my 2 fav characters are??).  I did almost cry when the big gingerbread man got hurt...but you have to understand I cried when the stay puff marshmellow man died in ghostbusters!! I love that big white puff! HE WAS THE MOVIE! (if anyone finds the bobble head of him WITH A HAPPY FACE--not the mena nasty one--please let me know).  But seriously Shrek was a great movie.  Then Gabby and I sat aimlessly in my house deciding our fate for the night.  It ended up taking us to see George (the last cousin) and chillin with him.  He's such an awesome guy.  And that brings me to here....where I have nothing useful or good to say.  This is more like a damn calendar of my life than anything else.  I don't have the mental capacoty to writing meaningful bull shit tho and no offense I don't want half the people reading this to know what I am thinking/feeling (I just might scare u)---well not today anyway.

My bed speaks to me and begs for my presence....I am off.
Sweet dreams

So last night. Allison and I braved public transportation for the first time (Us princesses normally drive to the city).  It ended up being quite easy and fun.  On the ferry there was a class trip from WIsconsin....dont ask we dont know.  I do know one of them started talking to us about McDonalds and we sat there like ""why are you talking to us??"" (we were nice...its just that the thought stop talkin to us wouldn't leave our heads).  Anyway, so we took our cute little asses to off the wagon where there were dollar beers (HELLO LOVE).  Everyone knows I am so not a beer drinker.  It's so weird bc I can handle hard liquor but beer, it just kills me.  After like 6 and a shot that the bartender bought us, I was feeling quite good. lol.  When we left I could not stop hiccuping! I never hiccuped b4 when I got drunk...and it lasted a long freakin time.  That and an actual midget hit on us.  So here I am in the city with Allison, who is buzzed and I am partially loaded, hiccupping, getting hit on by midgets and in a constant search for a bathroom!  I love my life. lol.  It was a good time and pting wasn't bad at all...In the time it took to get to the city and stuff, we would've been in traffic on the BQE and looking for parking.  Besides, it's summer.

Saturday was my graduation party.  Parts of the fam came to party with me.  Allison and Gabby came over early with an abundance of yummy alcohol.  They bought me a worm that says ""you did it"" for people to sign...it's so cute. I got loaded.  Really loaded. Jen stopped by for a bit.  Brian and John did too...actually I had called John to bring ice and in my loaded state of mind I'm joking on how is he going to bring an ice tray or like a little bucket....well he brought ice with him alright!  He opens his car door and has like 8 bags! I now have ice in like every freezer in my house.  This boy is an extremist.  Bri and him left mad early tho (you know smoking weed in John's open house will always have more importance then me...dicks).  It's all good tho cause me and Allison found other thing to occupy us the rest of the night. haha.  The only semi-prob I had that night was that phil wasn't enjoying the drinking festivities with me as much.  He'll just make it up later to me....not that we like each other when we are drunk anyway but regardless. THen sunday was Melissa's grad party..she's so cute.  You all need to meet her!  Then Phil and I saw Troy....

HELLO BRAD PITT AND ORLANDO BLOOM!!!!!!!!!!  

It was a GREAT movie...so beautifully done and stuff.  I was able to deal with the little differences in the movie and the book, such as how helen and paris hooked up, the war being 2 days instead of 10years and achilles being alive during the trojan horse (he actually dies be4 that takes place in the book) but then...THEN...and dont read this if you didn't see this movie......they kill agamemnon! That's so wrong!  He's suppose to go home and get killed by his wife and her lover bc he sacrificed his daughter to the god's be4 he left for the war and his son Orestes avenges his father's death! DONT THESE DIRECTORS KNOW ANYTHING! It's a whole other movie!!! That's it I am making an Agamemnon movie....watch it, love it, live it.

Well Gabby is going crazy bc shes in school so im gonna take care of her...get back to u soon. 

Kisses"

"event","Yesterday I sat through 2000 names at graduation..it was long and it was tedious but damn it, it was so worth it.  After they called my name I snuck over to Melissa S. to sit with her and turn our tassels to the left side of our head 2gether.  Theres something sad, yet quite liberating being out of this school.  I'm sure I'm gonna miss alot of it, especially since I'll eventually go to grad or law school and thats gonna be a bitch.  But i'm proud of myself.

So the highlight of my day? Besides that diploma sittin upstairs? EASY! That would be recieving my brand spanking new silver Mazda 3 s.  Mommy and daddy (and adam) surprised me.  It's so insane! The console has red lights and it has a 6 disc cd changer in my dash board!! it's 180 horsepower and a 2.3 liter engine with 17 inch rims.  My parents totally took car of everything.  I have to get pictures up of it as soon as possible to show everyone.

2morrow I invited some people over to celebrate.  PARTY! lol...well at least I WILL be partying with my bottles of alcohol.  

There was no point to this entry cept to celebrate my grad and my car!! SO YAY ME!

Gotta go for now
You know you love me"

"event","This weekend totally blew.  I had my uncle's wake all weekend. Saturday Gabby and I attempted to go out...but then God looked down and said ""i dont think so!"" and made the heavens open and a monsoon appear.  I mean there was lightening 3ft from my damn car!  Running from Gabby's house to my car made me drenched!  We ended up staying in where I proceeded to cheat on my diet.  Well we did go out later when the rain calmed a bit but it was really just to drive with Alli.  Sunday I had a christening with phils fam (we only went to the dinner tho) and then had a lovely break down at my uncle's wake (trust me it just wasn't pretty).  I went to his funeral 2day.  It's really sad bc my cousins are taking it really hard and watching them is difficult.  They are like my 2 brothers and sister!  I got to spend the day with them and their friends afterwards.  Everyone was really cool and hopefully I see them again soon. Hell I even got to see some people I havent seen for 10 years! I'm totally ecstatic that my cousins are around again (I really missed them!).  My ""nephew"" Raymond stood with me all day.  He's only 4 and hes not really my nephew.  Since his daddy Chris is my cousin, that makes him my cousin....but I'm pretending to be an ""aunt"" anyway. lol.  He is the cutest little kid tho.  And he is so mature for his age.  Anyone who asked if Raymond was annoying me got the response ""hey we have 4 whole years to catch up on here! I'm good!"".  This little boy actually makes me like children again!!! (everyone knows adam doesnt count with that last comment..I always like him).

But since I hardly got sleep this weekend, I'm exhausted and everytime I tried to fall asleep I have the phone ringing or someone (mom, adam) trying to talk to me, hence the bitchiness.  It's wearing off tho, so I think the sleepiness is passing.  

I am gonna bury myself in my book now bc I'm a nerd and don't really want to deal with people.... Until later"

"event","I woke up with one huge migraine (probably bc of sinuses) and here I am.  My mom said she'll treat me for my nails and stuff...Since I'm up, why will I pass that up? I still wish I was in bed though.  I have one funfilled weekend.  2night I have to go to George's (my uncle's) funeral (or is it wake? I always get them confused).  2morrow I have a christaining dinner to go to with Phil.  In th past 2 days, I had Gabs and Brian come by my house and drink and last night I stopped by phil's for a bit then suddenly got really sick and tired.  Hopefully, I'm up to going out later.

Brief deviation from whatever I'm talking about: Can someone please kill Jessica Simpson?  If I have to hear this take my breathe away shit song again I'm going to scream.  MTV is on, shes singing this god forsaken song and I cannot find my remote! 

As I was saying, I would be going out to celebrate the fact I'm not in school anymore but i just recieved my grades.  I did really well this semester but bc I failed my computer class 2 yrs ago my overall GPA isn't what I want it to be.  So now I have to go to the school and continue arguing this grade (i think the fact that I never saw my teacher helps...till this day I do not know what he looks like bc my class was too early for him to get up so he sent a grad student to teach it).  If they don't let me get rid of this grade, I may retake the class this summer (which i so do not want to do but I'm not sure if I have a choice at this point).

Well it's time for me to annoy my parents---bc that's what I do when I'm bored.

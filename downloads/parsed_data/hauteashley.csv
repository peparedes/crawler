"event","I attempted a diet this past week and I did extremely well, but I still feel extremely fat.  I know it's because I am going to start my period at some point this week... I just want this guy to go away.  Damn bloating.  I am really getting tired of having my period all together, the damn thing should just go away.  I mean I sure as hell don't ever want babies, so what's the point in having it anyway.
I've heard rumors that it's healthy to have those hormones going through you, but seriously... I don't fucking care.  Who needs to be healthy in the first place, when you can be thin and beautiful.  Haha.  I think I am just going crazy attempting to lose all of this weight before the summer starts, you know?  Gotta look sexy in my new black bikini, sweet!

Anyway, just felt like updating because I haven't come around in a little while.  Really looking forward to posting some more because right now I haven't been getting online nearly as much as I thought I would.  Oh well... things are going terrible because my period is starting this week.  Hopefully after that... all of my exercise and dieting will pay off.  Wish me luck!"

"event","I saw my doctor today and found out that I weigh 10 pounds more than what my freaking scale was telling me.

I feel like a fat ass, but I am starting a soup diet tomorrow that is going to last through Sunday. Once Monday rolls around I am going to start that master cleanse fast that I have been talking about for ages. Fortunately my parents have agreed to help me out with everything to some extent and my boyfriend is completely supportive with the whole ordeal.

I cannot describe how happy I am that I found the internet to help me out with everything that is going on in my head. Before I thought my eating problems were all in my head and I was creating a serious problem for myself. Now I realize that an eating disorder is really something that just occurs over time. Fortunately this is helping me understand my body more, so that I can lose weight comfortably without making myself sick like I used to. Thanks everyone, having you here to support me means so much at the moment."

"event","As I mentioned in my last entry, the parents have been really freakish about the idea of fasting.  Therefore, I am starting a modified fast tomorrow where I will be eating nothing besides soup.  The soup fast will continue through sunday and monday I will start the master cleanse mentioned in the previous entry.  I know this sounds crazy, but you have to understand that I live at home with both of my parents and my little brother.  Ugh!

Luckily, my boyfriend is completely supportive of everything as long as I am not trying to kill myself.  He knows that my health is always in my best interest and I would never to anything to place that in jeopardy.  We only see each other about twice a week, so it's not a huge problem.  This friday he has agreed to feed me soup and allow my fast next week.  What I love the most is that he tries not to eat too much around me while I am fasting.  I have a really bad habit of craving foods when I smell them, haha.  Isn't he the coolest boyfriend?


I've noticed a couple of the girlies from the forums have been stopping by and I just wanted to say thank you so much!  It really means a lot to have people that I can actually connect with around here.  I wont feel like these journal entries are a complete waste of time.  Thanks bunches because it means a lot too me.  Especially keeps me motivated, which is worth millions in my book!

"event","Eventually I am going to begin the master cleanse fast listed below because it sounds fantastic!  As of right now, I am having some problems at home.  I have been procrastinating on this fast all week long, but it's impossible for me to do this right now.  For one, I don't have the money and secondly my parents are bitching about how I need to eat some more.  Maybe sometime next week, just keep reading!

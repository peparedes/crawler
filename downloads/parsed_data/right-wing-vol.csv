"event","This is in response to a journal entry that was left by a friend of mine. She just so happens to be a liberal. I have to problem with that. But, since she informed people that all ""flames"" would be deleted...I will counter her point with mine. This is in all do respect to her. I respect this woman VERY much. She is strong and believes strongly in her political views...as am I. 

I am a member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. Which in short means that I am a conservative Republican. The Congress of the United States has a very important decision to make in the upcoming year. The Marriage Protection Amendment is an amendment to the United States Constitution that classifies the institution of marriage as one man and one woman. President George W. Bush, a known Christian has been in support of the Marriage Protection Amendment since late in his first term. It was a very big issue in his recent re-election. 

There is nothing wrong with gay people. Let me say that again, there is NOTHING wrong with gay people. But as a citizen of this United States...and a married one at that...I do not want the sacred vow of marriage to be degraded by allowing same sex marriage. Marriage always has been...and should REMAIN a sacred GOD-ORDAINED institution between a man and a woman. If we(the Right Wing and other Christians) do not do something, homosexual marriage will become a reality. I don't know about you but that thought that two men or two women could be united the same way my wife and I were...is pure filth to me. I do not want my children(one of which is on the way) to grow up in a world filled with homosexual marriage. How could you explain to your kids that his friend isn't odd because he has two daddies or mommies.

The fact of the matter is, the morality and the future of America is at stake. It's time to stand up and make a change and make your voice heard. Go to the link provided and sign the petition in favor of the Marriage Protection Amendment. It does not matter who's P.C. or not...the fact is that even if voting against gay marriage isn't ""P.C.""...its the right thing to do. Thanks.

"event","Well, opening night was last night. It went great. The theatre was sold out. So, there were alot of people in there which made it hot as balls. Not to mention that I'm wearing a leather jacket. So, yeah...I wasback to my old ways of sweating. But I can proudly say that I do not smell like a certain Rob Roseen after a show. But in the rehearsal process...I sweated out three mics in two runs of the show. Yea. I know. Gross. And in the second act our curtain broke so the ASM had to stand under the triangle and hold the curtain up. Oh Ken Lindahl, how I miss thee. Ken would have had that fixed in like 5 min. But if you gat a hankering to see a show tonight or tomorrow night...come on up to Rome, GA and see Honk! at Shorter College. I would tell you to come later but Friday, both Saturday shows and Sunday. Well, kids...I gotta grab a bite to eat before I go get my hair and make-up did. Peace."

Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
satisfied

Little things I should have
Said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind....

I really feel bad that you had to read some of the stuff that I wrote in this journal. Some of it is crap and I don't mean all the stuff I say...this is just a place for me to vent ya know? I really hope that I haven't upset you so much that you think I'm a bad person now. I love you Nicole. You are a beautiful and talented young woman and you make me proud all the time. I'm sorry I can't be there for you and Natalie as you go through high school. I don't know sometimes I feel like I'm not the best big brother in the world. I know we used to fight alot when I was back home...but now that I'm not around all the time I realize how much I really miss yall. I couldn't have asked for better sisters in the world. So, I hope you can forgive me and not look at me as a bad person. I want to be a good example for you and Natalie. Because I love you more that the two of you will ever know.

                          Love Your Big Brother,

"event","Oh man, today was great! I had an awesome audition for Dave Clemmons today. Dave is a casting director for Disneyland, The Lost Colony(a outdoor theatre in N. Carolina), his own company, and a Broadway training camp down in Tampa, Fla. So, I figured I'd pay homage to the great Robin Williams and sing ""Friend Like Me"" from Aladdin. Plus Dave is casting for small musicals of Aladdin and Snow White for Disneyland in Cali. So, the audition was great and I got alot of positive feedback and...he offered me a spot at the B-way training camp in Tampa!! Holy shit! I was so excited when he called be back after the audition. So hopefully I can afford the camp and I'll be doing something theatre related this summer. Annyhow...I'm pooped. The audition was at 8:45 this morning. Any one feeling a nap?"

"event","Well, I got back from ACTF and what a time it was. We had alot of fun minus the fact that we never got to go to the beach. ACTF is alot similar to high school thespian conference. In saying that I can say that the best part is watching the other schools shitty plays. By far the worst play I've ever seen was at ACTF, The Woman Who Fell From the Sky. Wow! This was without a doubt absolute crap. It was about some woman who was allegedly from an Indian tribe from Mexico. She spoke zero english and the ""bad, ignorant, American doctors"" misdiagnosed her and basically she went retarded. But other than that, West Side Story is being held for consideration to go to the Kennedy Centre in Washington D.C. Now, normally I'd be really happy for the school and I would want to show everyone how some little old school from Rome, Georgia can hold their own. But, I found today that if West Side goes to D.C. then Honk! - the show that I am in - will be canceled. WTF?! I'm so worried that I won't be able to perform this year...at all. I would be pissed beyond belief. And that's pretty much it for now. I'm off to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Peace."

"event","So, I went home for a part of the weekend to have my head shots taken. My roommate said that he was having a friend visit...a gay one. So, I was like yea whatever I don't care. I told him that he could have him over under the stipulation that NO ONE go near my side of the room. In case you don't know me too well...I'm extremely anal retentive about being clean. So, I drive back this morning and what do I see when I walk through the door. A FUCKING MESS! There is a pizza box...OPEN...on the floor accompanied by several items of clothing thrown about. Not to mention the Ouija board and the Devil's pitch-fork on the floor under my roomie's bed. What the hell! I'm think to my self...if this is what a gay orgy is like...I'm glad I wasn't invited. But then it happened, I saw my roommate asleep in MY bed. WHAT?! When I left the last thing I said was where is he sleeping. And Kyle said he'll sleep on my bed with me. I was like wtf?! How are you and another MAN fit on your twin bed. He convinced me however that it could happen. So, here I am after I kicked his out of my bed and threw him into the bed with his ""friend"" writing this. A rant. A big one. Of course I have already cleaned my half of the room up and stripped the bed in order to wash the sheets. But there is only one phrase to describe how frustrated I am. So, in the words of Liz Schewe...""I'm PISSED!!"""

"event","Well I'm back at school. I forgot what it was like for a second. But, alas, as soon as stepped through the fabled doors of Roberts Hall I smelled that good ol' Shorter smell. The people, I'll admit, I did miss. Yet, while I was home I realized how good of friends I have. My friends from high school are people that I never want to forget. I want to stay in contact with them all. They all bring such a unique flavor to my life. They all came to mine and Chelsea's wedding at it was so awesome to see them there supporting us in whatever we do. I know they are as excited as me and Chels are about the new BPAB baby coming our way in July. Being married is awesome. I had always feared dieing alone. Now I never have to have that feeling again. Because I know that no matter where I go she will be right there beside me...always. I love her. Chelsea. My wife."

     Unless you're from the planet Mars or under a rock picking your ass, you know that my girlfriend and I, Chelsea, are having a baby and we're getting married on January 2, 2005. And guess what? We're excited...and if you didn't get an invitation...that means you not important enough to us to be there. Tough shit, huh? Anyway, peace!"

"event","Last night was very interesting. There was a fiasco that went down where people were given the choice of seeing the 4-week #1 movie National Treasure or staying home and renting a movie(Mean Girls). Those who chose the wayward path were left behind to a sub-par comedy. Those that took the way of the wise saw one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. All I can say about National Treasure is = w00t! What action. What drama. What edge-of-the-seat thriller twists and turns. If you missed out on this movie...go and see it. FAST! I admit, at first every person is going to have their doubts about the movie. Nicholas Cage...he's let us down before = Snake Eyes. But does he deliver in this flick? OH YES! I was totally now aware of the twists and turns that this action packed movie would lead me on. And another plus...if you like American History...GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I learned so much more about the founding fathers than I expected. The movie also leads you through the nations top monuments in fast paced chases and gun slinging battles. Plus...JOHN VOIGHT plays the dad! Come on people...Jonh Voight. He's awesome. But seriously...go see National Treasure. If you go and see it and you don't like it, that's totally understandable. But, if you're like my friends, and you just make fun of it and don't even give it a chance...you're missing out. Oh, and you're also an American hating terrorist."

"event","Well...it really has been a long time since I've updated my journal. It's really weird too, because I have had so much go on since the last time I wrote. Let's see...

There was Halloween that I really never wrote about. Man was that fun! There was this big party ar Matthew Schmuck's place and everyone was pretty much trash. I had about 4 cups of keg beer and tasted the hunch punch and about vomited. Stan, this fuck-up who goes to my school, made it with vodka, gin, and Fresca. WTF?! Last time I checked it was with Everclear and Hawaiian Punch. Alas, the first time since high school that I missed the talent of Clay Cox. Man that kid could make some hunch punch. Well, I went to the Halloween party as FDR(pre-wheelchair but w/ a cane) and Chelsea went as Little Red Riding Hood. I wasn't too drunk, but I wasn't able to drive back to the hotel. That was pretty much the end of that.

Honk! auditions finished up last night and I'm extremely happy with the way things turned out. I was casted as Tom Cat aka the part I wanted. In my experience, being the bad guy is so much more fun than playing the old jew, or father in my case. Really though, there were some screwed up casting choices made by the director though. Whatever, life goes on. We start rehearsals on the 10th of January. Not like I won't be back from Christmas holidays...I have to be back January 3 for opera rehearsal! That was the biggest mistake of my acting career. I hate the opera. I thought it would ba an interesting experience and I absolutely despise the whole thing. It's almost over though and I have vowed that this is my first and last opera.

So, finals are coming up. I shouldn't be the one to complain seeing as I only have 2 finals. Juries are the thing that I'm worried about. Voice juries are TODAY! Gosh, they got here so fast. Ballet juries are like next week and our piano and diction finals are the Monday after Thanksgiving. Thank god I don't have an english final. I just have to write my last research paper about how Mormonism is a fake religion aka a cult. 

Well that's really all from my world. Even though there is only like one person I know who reads this...I think she might ba happy I finally updated my journal. If you are a first time reader and you like what you read, let me know. Drop me and e-mail or a comment. Keep reading too if you like. So, until next time...

P.S. - Remember...Republicans go to heaven!"

"event","Today is a great day to be an American. The United States has finally answered the call. The country finally realized that there was NO WAY IN HELL that John F. Kerry was going to defend this country against terrorist. The terrorist are scared of Bush because he doesn't take any bullshit. John Kerry is a UN pussy. And the US finally realized that. And all you Clinton lovers...he NEVER got over 51% of the popular vote! HA! The fact of the matter is that the United States has decided George W. Bush is the right man for the job. Hell yea! I love this country! Oh yea...THE GAY MARRIAGE BAN WAS PASSED BY A LANDSLIDE IN GEORGIA! Homos = get out.

"event","Today I was made aware of a problem that I thought had gone. Have you ever had a problem that you couldn't put your finger on, but it insisted on making your life and living hell? Well, if you haven't...let me tell you that it sucks. I feel like I am doing everything in my power to go over the line of being a good boyfriend and a good friend. Yet, there is still something that isn't right. And the thing that scares me the most is that I have no clue what or how to stop what is happening. And it hurts me so much because I am doing it to a person that I love so much. I feel so helpless. In my mind, it's the scariest thing I can imagine. I can see her standing in front of me. By the look in her eyes I can tell that she can't see me. I'm screaming at the top of my lungs but she can't see or hear me. Then I can see the hurt in her eyes and I scream louder...but she still doesn't hear. As the tears roll down her face in disappointment...she slowly walks away. And I am exactly the way I have always been in my life...alone. I'm so alone & afraid too. I can't lose her. I can't. She is what causes me to exist. Without her, I am nothing."

"event","Why?

Why do I feel so utterly powerless? I feel like I've lost control. I feel like I have no clean grasp of my life anymore. There are things in my life that I thought I was sure of and they no longer seem so clear. Let me tell you one of the most painful things that will ever happen to you in your life. When the one person that you care about more than the well being of yourself hurts. She is hurting inside and I can't do anything about it. I feel like she tells me that she trusts me, yet there are some few(and let me reiterate few) times where I hear doubt in her voice. And I'll admit that I have messed up pretty bad in the months of our relationships. Sometimes I don't know how she can put up with me over and over again. I guess that's what true love is? All I know is that whenever I hurt her I can feel every bit of the anguish that she feels at that very moment. It makes me feel horrible and yet sometimes I do it anyway. Lie. I lie about the dumbest things and I don't know why. The dumbest things ever. Like last night, I told her I was at a birthday party and I wasn't. I was sitting in my dorm room feeling sorry for myself that I couldn't see her. But I knew if she knew that I was sad that she would not be able to be just the same. We're like that you see? We can sense each other's feelings. So, when she reads this or she finds out that I wasn't at that party and I was just laying in bed and staring at the ceiling...she'll be upset. And I totally deserve it. I'm such a shit. I feel totally useless. It's almost as if I don't even exist."

"event","Wow. Today went really slow for me. All my classes seemed really to really drag. My voice lesson was just like it always is. And can I stress how much it sucks to have an English teacher that is a grading nazi. I mean come on, you have to cut us college kids some slack sometimes. For those of you who don't know my English teacher, Mrs. Betty Candler, I hate her. This woman loves the English language so much I can't even stand it. This is the woman who spanked her three year old daughter because she said the word ""ain't"". Yea. Except that was a long time ago, because honestly, Betty has got to be in her mid-60s. She even came out of retirement to start teaching again. So needless to say...everybody isn't doing so hot in her class. 

But wanna know what really pisses me off. Ok, I know that I am a musical theatre major and that music is my life and all. But the rehearsals here don't start until 6 or 7 o'clock. WTF?! That's so freaking late. And our teachers wonder why we all look so tired in the mornings. But, being here at Shorter College, there really isn't much that happens on the party scene. I mean there is a party on Friday night, but I doubt I'm gonna get drunk or whatever. Not that I really need too. I don't know. College is just really fucking gay. You come to college to get away form the hypocrisy of high school and all you get when you come here is the exact same thing. I mean the only difference between the two is that you live at college. Whatever, I'm making it sound like I don't like here. I love it at Shorter. But there are sometimes that I really do wish I could be back in a place where everyone knew you and you knew them. And then of course there are the friends that you make in high school that you never want to forget. And the thing that sucks is...alot of them just get lost in your new life. 

But let me tell you about someone who will never be lost in my life. Her name is Chelsea. And I am totally in love with her. We've been together for a little over 9 months now and I never thought I would ever fall in love with someone this early in life. But she has totally proved me wrong. But right now I want to take some time and talk to the guys in the world out there who think that there is no one who could ever possibly love them. I used to be one of those guys. I know how it feels to be the one that all the girls want to just be ""friends"" with. It really sucks. But trust me...when you least expect it someone is going to come along and totally chance your mind and your view on life forever. Without Chelsea I don't think I would have the confidence that I have in myself right now. And the hard part is all you can say is ""I love you"". I don't know how to show or tell her how much she means to me. But I know she knows. Trust is something that can't be taken lightly. That is something Chelsea taught me. And to all those guys out there, I want you to know that I feel your pain. It's hard. I know. But if you stick with WHO YOU ARE and don't compromise that for anything...someone will come along and love you. As much as you think it's not possible. It is. I know it is. I'm living proof."

"event","Warning: The entries in the following journal may easily offend the common live journal user. If easily offended beware of the content that you are about to read. This will be used as a place for me to rant and to post whatever I decide is necessary.

     Fellow Readers:

            This entry is about to be devoted to the people that sit on their ass, don't vote, and then complain about the state of out great nation. Is the United States in turmoil? Yes. Do we need a strong leader who will defeat terrorism? Yes. Can John Kerry and John Edwards defend the United States from terrorist threats? No. Not saying that if George W. Bush is elected there will be no attacks. Terrorists attacks are unpredictable and we MUST stay on the offensive. The Kerry-Edwards ticket, if elected, will put the United States on the defensive. That is exactly what the terrorists want. Osama votes Kerry! But whatever, if you want to vote Kerry, then vote Kerry. The fact of the matter is that 25% of Kerry's OWN constituents believe that he will lose to President Bush in the coming election. That's pretty bad when even your own party thinks you have no chance. But, if you vote for Kerry...at least you voted. The people that really chap my hide are the people that sit on their fat ass and complain about the US and how Bush is wrong...AND THEY STILL DON'T VOTE! SHUT THE HELL UP! Your opinion doesn't matter anymore. You are nothing. You aren't even a statistic. Your just a lazy bum. So, if you do vote...I don't care if you vote Kerry or Bush. You can say that you did your American duty and voted. If you are undecided, go out and do some research before you do. Please don't just vote the way your friends do and then send this country into a damn tailspin. Oh, and if you don't vote...piss off.

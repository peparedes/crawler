I could buy a Ford Focus, again, but my parents are retarded and don't want to ever give me the money from MY CAR that they crashed, so I can never buy a new one. I can't do anything without a car. I don't want to live at Chris' grandparents house. They go through all our shit like we don't notice and then they say they have the right to because it's their house. And we can't even leave because if we do there's no car. I'm trapped."

It was a nice March, overall. I got to go snowboarding with Harrison and actually try not to suck at it, so it was fun. AND we looked at animals and owls and stuff, I love owls more than you. I also almost got arrested. I'm still not sure what's going to happen with that because the po-pos haven't contacted me at all....So, I pulled a fire alarm in Macy's and they thought I tried to light the store on fire, basically. Moving on..For St.Patty's day Mary and I decided we wanted to get trashed, so I brought her to Whitman with me and we found Harry and Joe and then we got Tara and Kevin and we went to the Marriott to have a hotel party. Juli and Lou came later, too. We all got trashed. And, you get really really drunk when you play never have I ever and you've done everything. The next morning Tara, Harry, and I went drunk driving to find a BK, it was scary, but Tara's a good drunk driver. Last week was pretty boring. I have work all this week and probably all next week. BUT I GET MY LICENSE ON THE 10TH!!! And then I'm going to take a whole week off from Lambert's and go to Maine and shit. =]"

"event","Update time.&nbsp;
Last weekend I went to New Hampshire with Harrison to go to his cousin's wedding.
The wedding was fun.&nbsp;We got to decorate a car =]
When we came back Saturday night we went back to Weymouth. It kind of sucked.
Came home on Sunday after watching lots of movies.
Scary Movie 3 &lt;333333333333
Monday I had to work. After the bank was closed, so I couldn't cash my check. But I went to Walmart With Joe and Harry and got pink earrings.
Tuesday the power went out, so the bank was closed again, but I begged my mom to bring me to the one in Brockton. After&nbsp;Joe and I&nbsp;went to the bus station and took the bus to the Westgate Mall. Obtained a shirt, a pair of pants, socks, a candle, and good smellies. All in all, it was a pretty good day.
Wednesday I had work again.
Thursday I took the bus to Hollywood Video in Brockton with Joe and Harry because they needed a girl for the card. It sucked. Got the Final Fantasy movie. Came back to my house to watch it.
Yesterday, Friday, I had work. Found Joe after and my mom picked us up and drove me to the bank to cash my check and then we went back to my house. Then Joe and I went to Walmart. Got some beads and gimp and came back to my house to make lizards. It's exciting.
I need plans. No one hangs out with me anymore =["

"event","Today was pretty sweet. I woke up really early so I could get ready for today. Because it is Harry's 18th birthday. Uhh.. Went to Walmart with my mom, then Hanover mall, and finally the South Shore Plaza where I got plugs for Harry. Got home around 11. Joe showed up shortly after. I made a cake. It was chocolate with vanilla frosting that was pink. And i copied the Harry Potter cake by writing ""Happee Birthdae Harry"" in green. I'm wicked cool. Harry took forever to show up. Finally got here. Did the whole birthday thing"". I got him awesome red and green star plugs, 2 dvds, X-Box game, and an awesome robot dinosaur thing. It was amusing. After we walked to Venus and Harry said I should go to this wedding thing with him. So, I called Nicole in search of a dress. I biked down to her house and received the dress. Got a ride from my mom and went back to Venus. Got CRUNKED. Hah. Conner and Ben showed up. I'm kicked out of Papa Gino's for no reason at all. It's wicked gay. Yep. So, all in all, today was a pretty good day.

PS I'll add pictures later."

"event","Yesterday was crazy..<br />I hung out with Matt in the beggining of the day and we went mini golfing. And then we went to get ice cream where we saw DEANE!!!![Harry's Dad] And then we drove around for awhile looking for a park when we decided just to go bowling. Then after that we went to the park and I went home at 4. At about 5;30 Joe came over and we decided that we wanted to go to Plymouth to go on a Ghost Tour because we had a coupon. So we go, it was alright, nothing great. So then we get stuck there because there are no trains back. And we steal some soda, wine, and hackey sacks. It was pretty cool. Met some fuckers that stole our money. I'm so pissed about that, but I get paid next week anyways, so it equals out. So we walk down the train tracks at about 5 AM. Joe complains too much. But then I found a turtle and everything was good again. Wanter around FOREVER. Finally get to the Halifax train station after a lot of trouble. We completely missed the Kingston train station. I'm not sure how, but it sucks. So we get back to Whitman and release the turtle and now I am here. I'm probably going to go to sleep soon because I haven't slept in over 24 hours.&nbsp;<br /><br />

haven't uploaded yet from Hanson, but once I get my new laptop I'll probably put them up.<br /><br /></div>
<br /><br /><br /><strong>My April Vacation<br /></strong><br /><strong>Thursday </strong>Went to the South Shore Plaza with Harry, Joe, Rob, and Winston. It was interesting.<br /><strong>Friday </strong>I think I went to the Kingston Mall with Sean and then saw the end of Scary Movie 4 and the beginning of Stay Alive. Jamie, Jill, Mike, and Kerri were there, too. Then Sean and I left around 730PM and got some book he wanted.<br /><strong>Saturday </strong>Somehow ended up in the Middle School Woods with Harry, Rob, and Joe. Went to Marcello's parking lot after. Not an eventful day.<br /><strong>Sunday</strong> Was Easter. I went to my grandparents house in the morning. Walked the dog for forever. Went to Harry's. No one answered. Harry and Rob came to my house. Ended up back at Harry's. Went home at 11ish, I think.<br /><strong>Monday</strong> I don't remember the beginning of the day, but I remember going to the Post Office with Rob, Joe, and Harry and then I left and went to Bill's. Jamie, Sam, Nicole, Justin, Bill, and Joe Cushing were there. They were watching Saw 2. Then we watched this other movie that was pretty sweet. After Sam, Nicole, Justin, and I went to the park. Ended up going to Harry's. Joe and Rob were there. Walked around the area? Ended up back at Harry's without Rob. Watched Jarhead. Went home at around 1030.<br /><strong>Tuesday</strong> Went to Sam and Nicole's house and Justin and Jamie were there. Stephanie came later. Did Stephanie's chores. Went to the South Shore Plaza, minus Jamie. After, Stephanie and I went to the park and met up with Justin. We went to Joe Cushing's. Found Sam and Nicole. Went Home at around 11.<br /><strong>Wednesday</strong> Went to Harry's with Joe and he was bleaching his bathroom, so I died. Joe left because he had to go to Wendy's. Harry and I went to the park and found a wandering Stephanie. Later, everyone showed up. It was like Spring Break Whitman, almost. Walked around town with Harry, Joe, and Conner. Got a fever. Died at Harry's. Went home at 1130PM.<br /><strong>Thursday</strong> Walked uptown with Sam, Nicole, and Justin. Went back to Sam and Nicole's house. Died. Went to Burger King. Met up with Joe, Rob, and Harry. Went to the park. Met up with Conner at some point. Rob wanted to go to the movies, so we took the train to Kingston. Missed the last train home. Sat at the train station until 11PM. Squished 5 people into a backseat. Returned home at around 12AM.<br /><strong>Friday</strong> Joe and Rob came over and we walked to Harry's. I died. Went home. Continued with the death process. <br /><strong>Saturday</strong> Met up with Sam and Nicole, but it was too cold. So, after going to Stephanie's house, we went back to Sam and Nicole's and did nothing. Went home really early.<br /><strong>Sunday</strong> Basically nothing. There's nothing to do anyways. This vacation was kind of uneventful."

<b>Sunday</b>  Went to the Hanover mall with Jamie and Justin <BR>
<b>Monday</b>  Went to the Kingston mall with Joe and saw Final Destination 3 and then I dyed my hair brown/orange<BR>

<b>Wednesday</b> Walked around town with Ian and Joe, then went to BK, exciting.<BR>
<b>Thursday</b> Explored busses with Sean. We have no lives, seriously. Saw Joe and Ian at BK <BR>
<b>Friday</b> Went over Bill's house with Sam. Bill, Tony, Joe Cushing, Nicole, Sam, Derek, Sean, Stephen, and Dennis were there. Ended up going to Wendy's and then Tony drove me home and almost got caught =O <BR>
<b>Saturday</b> Did nothing all day. Tony came and I sat in his car for a half hour. Decided to go to the movies in Randolph with Tony and Jeromy and saw Final Destination 3 AGAIN. Seriously, I love seeing movies twice in a row that I didn't really like, but I didn't have to pay either time =D <BR>
<b>Sunday</b> Went to Johnnies/Papa Ginos/BK with Nicole and met up with Sean, Harry, and Joe. Harry and Joe hate me and left. So, Nicole, Sean, and I went to Brandon's and Sean deffinatly ditched us. Nicole and I went to the ISLAND and mis padres drove us to Timber Lanes and Nicole beat me because she got like 70 strikes. Played games for literally 2 seconds to get a Jelly Fish Yoyo, which we were sucsessful in AND we got candy!!<BR>
And that's my whole vacation. And I don't want to go to school, it's like a prison. Ack, I can't wait until SPRING BREAK WHITMAN!!!!<BR><BR><BR>

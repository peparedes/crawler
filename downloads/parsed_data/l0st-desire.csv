"event","okay, so I'm in my vertebrate zoology lab we have an assignment where we have to collect animals and key them out to species genus level and then show them to our TA. right? right. It's already s slightly stupid assignment, seeing as how if you collect what they tell you to (the minimum as they say) you get a C. Now, please correct me if I'm wrong, but if i bust my ass and find the 5 different fish (salt and freshwater) that they tell me too, toads, frogs, lizards, turtles and snakes (yes, multiples of each) and 3 different mammals (2 of which can't be rodents).....i'm gonna get a C? I call total bullshit on that. If i get all the crap they tell me to, i should get an A....isn't that how school works? To get an A you have to bring in extra stuff and rare animals. So now my grade all comes down on how many animals i can catch and how rare they are...nice. So that s the first thing this rants about, but not the main focus.

I think its extremely cruel to the animals when the school sends out untrained students (of which they have taught none how to safely trap an animal) and have them haul the animals back into class on Friday. More than half of the people go out hunting on the weekends, and while my TA i willing to meet people outside of class to mark off the specimen, almost everyone waits till Friday to show her. Which means most of these people have the animals they have caught sitting and starving in water bottles or bare portable terrariums. Last Friday some guys brought in a young Javelina in a large dog kennel. The poor things snout was bleeding freely from ramming into the cage and was foaming at the corners of its mouth from smacking its lips together in a vain attempt to warn the 20 people who were crowding around its cage 'AWWWWWWWW-ing' loudly. The guys that brought the javelina in got it checked off and left with it. I'm hoping they released it, but as wild pigs are seen as a pest, probably not. Today however, was almost as much as i could take. This guy caught a raccoon in a trap and brought it in. The poor thing was scared to death and so stressed out it was trembling. He left it in the bright florescent lighting near the door where everyone was tramping around and right next to the cart where all the jars of the reptiles we were keying out where everyone kept getting stuff off of and slamming down jars. There was a huge crowd of people with the faces mashed up next to the trap loudly exclaiming how sorry they felt for it while the poor raccoon huddle in the corner. When i expressed my concern about the raccoon to the guy who brought it in, he said, ""he's having a great time, he got 2 tamales out of it, and look how much fun he's having!"" It took every millimeter of self restraint in me not to slap him across the face. This one girl spent much of the class sitting next to it, telling it how sorry she was and how she wanted to let it go. She kept taking pictures of it (with her really loud camera). I may not be an animal expert, but i do have fucking common sense. Sitting there talking to the animal and pressing her face up to the side of the cage is not going to help it!!!! You want to help the animal, sit your ass down!!! The guy who brought it in had a towel that he eventually dropped on top pf the cage with no thought as the raccoon jumped). At the time I was getting a snake of the cart so i opened up the towel and spread it so it covered the top and the side of the cage that faced the door. So after i sit back down, the stupid girl kept going up to the trap and lifting up the towel and STILL talking to it. When the guy took it outside, after about 2 hours, he put it in the bed of his truck and came back inside!! Many people had already left the lab and the TA told him he could leave to release it. Its times like this that i wish i could murder. Those of you who know me know how i feel about animal cruelty, (and this i feel was def. animal cruelty). It really broke my heart. and started my day off bad."

"event","So, today was my mom's Christmas party at her office. This is the time every year when her boss, Mr Walker gives them their Christmas bonuses. Except this year....no bonus. There was also no bonus for summer either.

I feel bad for my mom. She's so depressed now. I mean, William and I are old enough now. We understand. There's nothing i really wanted anyway. But all my mom's dreams of showering us with gifts are kinda broken. But the thing is, that money was so much more important than our Christmas presents. The truck needs new tires, my mom needs new contacts, loans need to be paid off. It seems like the number of hands reaching out to grab money from my parents are just growing and growing.

But, I'm going home tomorrow so maybe i'll be able to cheer her up. Truth be told i'm getting a little depressed here too. I need some family time. 1 final to go baby.

Other than that i just snuggled up in bed today and watched movies. and had like, a 5 min job interview. I dunno if thats a good thing or bad thing. but they asked for my schedule soooo we'll see.

which is what i did today. It was a BEAUTIFUL day and i was super bored, so Amanda and I went and hit the beach. It was fun. There were a ton of wind surfers out there since it was super windy. ....obviously...

I have to go to school at 8 tomorrow morning to sign for an exam i don't have to take. Then drive back to my apt. My English 'final' isn't till 5:30 in the afternoon. Unfair?

At least it gets my lazy ass up.

I've started to go walking around the school track at night by myself again. I realized the other day that i really haven't been getting enough me loving in my schedule. It was nice. I forgot how peaceful it was just to walk in the dark by yourself. 

Strange that last night, even though i was alone, i wasn't lonely. And it seems that i've been nothing but lonely lately. i want a man. does that make me sound desperate? seriously, i need someone to love and cuddle. I don't know if there are adequate words to describe the hole that seems to be growing and growing inside myself. There's a role in my life that neither my friends nor family can fill... and that sounds so fucking emo. get over yourself Rachel.

My stoner/drunken room-mate called me sweetheart in a very condescending tone yesterday. I almost punched him in the face. asshole. He lost his key to the front door like...a month ago and doesn't want to dip into his smoking/drinking money to get 25 dollars to buy a new key. So he expects us to leave our door unlocked 24 hours a day...even when no one's here. yeah...not gonna happen. So when i left to go to the store yesterday i locked the door...since no one was home. Well, apparently he came home after i left and was locked out. (and somehow i don't feel bad....) so when i came in he was like ""Rachel.......you locked me out sweetheart.""
.....................ex-fucking-scuse me? man.....deep breath in...........deep breath out.........

When i was home last weekend i went drinking with my my old latin teacher from highschool. It was one of the most surreal experiences of my life.

I'm so ready for it to be Wednesday, so i can go home for an extended period of time

"event","Home from Thanksgiving. It was wonderful. 

Traveling home for Holidays makes me feel so grown up.

And restored. There's nothing better for my spirit than spending time in the place i grew up, surrounded by family. Finding remnants of all my old hopes and dreams. It's very inspiring to me.

While i was home i snooped (is it tech. snooping when its your room?) through all me old stuff from High School and earlier. It was just what i needed. I've felt so drained and defeated lately, but looking through all my old birthday cards, locker signs, notes, and just scraps of stuff i got this amazing feeling of love and happiness wash over me. It was amazing. And i thought...maybe i can do this :).

There's almost a mantra of things i tell myself, through bad days, horrible dance rehearsals where i feel so frustrated that its all i can do not to cry, late nights studying, times when i get so mad i wanna scream, and moments where i know if i sit down i'll never get up.

1. <b><big>You Are Not the Audience.</b></big> This came from one of my romance novels of all places, and the moment i read it i could not get it out of my head. It helps remind me that <b>I</b> am the lead in my life and to do what makes me happy, not what others tell me will make me happy.

2.<b><big>Defy Gravity.</b></big> Oh Wicked. If i could play any song so loud that my eardrums almost burst it would be this one. I have this written in huge green letters on my mirror so that i see it every day. Reminds me to reach for the stars.

3. <b><big>Now is Real.</b></big> The other day in yoga class my teacher was basically saying this: The past no longer exists, the future may never exist. The only real thing in life is this moment. now. now. now. And as humans we never live in the now. We relive the past, plan the future, and never even notice <b><big><i>now</big></i></b>. I had never really thought about that before, i mean, <i>really</i> thought about it. After any horrible disaster or tragedy, it's easy to realize how fragile life is and how you have to live each moment as your last. Whats hard is actually doing it. And my teacher explained that it's hard because in this moment, now, your brain can only observe. it can't plan or review. You have no control.....and somehow, i like that thought. Now, that in no way excuses laziness or unpreparedness. Its just a nudge to stop everything for a moment, and let go of your control. Try it, its good for you :).

4. <b><big>I Am Loved.</b></big> Cause i am, by all sorts of people. It helps me when i feel worthless.

5. <b><big>YOU Are the Only One Who Can Bring Happiness or Unhappiness to Your Life.</b></Big>Another Yoga lesson, one that i'm finding to be very true."

"event","I'm so over my life. I mean, i'm 20 years old, thats 2 decades, and what have i done with it? nothing. I've never been outside the US, never even gone that many places IN the US.

I mean sure, i've gone to school, made it into college, and am working hard towards becoming a exotic animal vet, a career that i really don't have a chance in hell at making. But hey, i'm not giving up. I have wonderful friends that will always support me no matter what, and my family has always been extremely loving towards me. They've never put down any of my dreams or ambitions, never laughed at my feelings, and have given me nothing but support and help no matter what path i choose. I never fear that i will disappoint them(with the exception of getting my tattoo, and even that's not a big thing). I am strong in my faith, it may not be the most conventional faith, but i know God loves and protects me.

So why then do i feel so dissatisfied with everything? I know it sounds like i'm bitching about nothing. I have the type of life some people would love to have. I have a family who loves me, i may not have a lot of money, but i've never wanted for food or warmth or even clothes.

Maybe thats the trouble. I've never really had to work hard to get anything. Getting into Incarnate Word was easy. I didn't work that hard in high school, but still got into the college i wanted. I've never really been turned down for anything. And somewhere in the back of my mind thinks that i've got a sure shot to getting into Vet school, even though my grades are pretty crappy and only the top 132 students get into A&M's vet program. And you can bet that those top 132 students have nothing but As. So why would they chose me, a less than mediocre student with Bs and Cs? They won't, but my mind doesn't believe that anything will prevent that.

I'm not a spoiled brat. When it comes to material things i have very rarely gotten what i really wanted. Growing up in a slightly below middle class family there was never that much money to spend on frivolous things. It just seems when it comes to the important big stuff in life, i've always gotten my way.

This is why i've decided to go on a cross country road trip. I was reading this one woman's blog about how she went from San Fransisco to New York on her Vespa, and how it totally changed her life. Thats what i need, some amazing life changing experience. I need to go thousands of miles from anything i've known, lose myself, and then start to find who i really am. I know there are millions of things out there in this world bigger than me, i've seen amazing pictures on TV and the internet, but I need to see them myself. I need to realize what a small role i play in this world.

I need to change my life.

So, i'm planning on the summer after i graduate college. I figure thats just about the right timing. HAHA i just wish i was starting tomorrow."

I've come to the realization that i'll never be pretty. and i'll never like myself. Now i'm not writting this for every one to say, ""Rachel you really are pretty blah blah blah"" cause i've never believed you and i never will. Honestly. I'll never be skinny or pretty. I'll never be the girl who walks down the street and has people turn to look at her. i'm just clusmy stupid Rachel. And that'l be fine with me....in about 20 years.

And he basically told me tonight that he doesn't like me. ""The girls who like me are always the ones i don't 'like' like that"" and i finally realized it was possible to go on living when your heart explodes. and i realized i'm not meant for love. I guess thats why i'm so obssesed with it, cause it will never be for me. I mean, i've always had the ability to look down the road of my life and see where i'm gonna be. And never once have i seen myself married...or even in love. HElping others find it, dream about it, read about it....and thats it.

I'm almost to the point i was in middle school, and that makes me hate myself even more. i think i'm gonna....i dunno...i don't know what to do. How do i love myself? i've tried. i've looked in the mirror before and thought...i look pretty.....but then i see myself seconds later and i want to break the mirror..or my face...

And i guess that makes me weak, that one boy has the power to make me feel like this. I've always wanted to be strong. I look at my mom and the things she's overcome, and here i am crying aboutr my fucking life. I just wish i could be as strong as she is....

i don't even want to go on anymore, i don't want to face him tomorrow and let him see my swollen eyes cause he'll know i was crying over him...and at least to the majority of the world i'd like to appear strong."

"event","So i imagined that leaving home would be hard....but i never thought it would be this hard. i havn't been able to stop crying since my parents left at about 1 today....this sucks soo much.

good news though...no room mate yet. Does it make me a horrible person to hope that she doesn't show up?

I love the apratment, it has a living room, 2 bedrooms, and a really nice kitchen. And a bathroom...naturally.

And i know things will get better...it just sucks right now while they're happening.

At least tomorrow i'll be out doing stuff...not just sitting here in my room crying all day."

Loyalty:

You value loyalty a fair amount.
You're loyal to your friends... to a point.
But if they cross you, you will reconsider your loyalties.
Staying true to others is important to you, but you also stay true to yourself.

Honesty:

You don't really value honesty.
You do value getting your way, no matter what.
And if a little lying is required to do that, no problem.
A few white lies never hurt anyone (at least, that's what you tell yourself!)

Generosity:

You value generosity highly.
So much so that you often put your own needs last.
There's nothing wrong with having a caring heart...
But you may want to rethink your ""open wallet"" policy.

Humility:

You value humility highly.
You have the self-confidence to be happy with who you are.
And you don't need to seek praise to make yourself feel better.
You're very modest, and you're keep the drama factor low.

Tolerance: 

You value tolerance highly.
Not only do you enjoy the company of those very different from you...
You do all that you can to seek it out interesting and unique friends.

"event","So not only do i have an apartment at TAMU-CC, but i have an apartment by myself...i'm still trying to let that sink in...

So MO Ranch was last weekend, amazing weekend. We stayed in a different place than usual, it was soooooooooo awsome. A HUUUGE house, hahah i kept getting lost. I usually don't like MO Ranch, cause i never really get along with my extended family, but this weekend was really cool. My Great Aunt and Uncle renewed their wedding vows, 50 years, it made me cry. It was beautiful and really strengthed my belief in true love.

And it was really cool because since i'm 18 now my parents let me drink with all my other cousins. hahaha, it was soo fun. But Saturday noght i did something to my ankle, and REALLY hrt it, it was all swollen and bruised and i couls barely walk on it. But its better now.. HAHA my dad looked at me and said, ""thats why you shouldn't drink and walk you drunken idiot"" HAHAHAHAHAHA oh daddy, i love you.

But, my grandmother (my mom's mom) is really sick. She had to be taken to the Hospital yesterday in an ambulance because she couldn't even get out of bed. The doctor said that she was sooooo dyhydrated and they gave her an IV. He also said it was pulminary, so we don't really know whats going on. My mom wants to go up to Colorado and be with her for a while. Its so hard to watch my mom go through this. It breaks my heart.

That and i only have 52 days till i move away...

"event","So i went to my A&M Corpus Christi Orientation Thursday and Friday. It was sooooo amazing. I love it down there. I really think i'm gonna like it. So Thursday was the main sign in and everything, and then Friday was this big all day thing for New Students. It was really fun. I met some people who seemed really cool and we seem to get along really well.

So when my mom and i got there on Thursday, the sign in didn't start until 4, and we got there a little after noon, so we grabbed some towels and headed down to the beach which was really cool. Except there were jellyfish everywhere! My mom and i could barely walk down the beach there were so many! So we were sitting there on the sand, gazing longingly into the ocean, really mad and disappointed that we weren't gonna be able to get into the water, when we decieded, consequences be damned! We're gonna o in the ocean. Which we did. And we didn't get stung. It was awsome. There was hardly any seaweed, and the waves we big and perfect. Wonderful time.

So during orientation we sign up for our classes and all of us are assigned a academic advisor, mie was Johm Moury. So i sit down with him and he asks me, so what do you wanna be when you grow up? And i said Vet. And he asked me how sure, nd i laughed and said, sure since i was two sure. And i already had all the classes i wanted to take planned so we were done registering me in like, two mins and he goes, wow, i've never really had the time to advise at these things. So we sat there for another 10 mins talking about my future, which was really cool. It really calmed me down about things.

And it turns out that i chose the hardest major in the world to take-biomedical science with a minor in theatre....hahah crazy i know. Buuuut i think i'm gonna have to drop that minor, cause uhm Biomedical science with a pre-vet career plan....not gonna be easy..AT ALL. But after being there i know i can do it. It's gonna be the hardest thing i've probably ever done, but i'll do it.

And i got my housing. Since it was so late that i turned it in, all they had left were two bedroom apartments which is Fucking AWSOME! i'm gonna have an apartment! thats CRAZY!!! yep. too cool.

So my Schedual (not that you people care) is as follows:

<b><u><big>MONDAYS</b></u><small>

9:00-9:50 --> Chemistry
11:00-11:50 --> Biology
1:00-2:15 --> English
2:30-3:20 --> First Year Seminar

<b><u><big>TUESDAYS</b></u><small>

11:00-12:15 --> Theatre
2:00-5:00 --> 3 HOUR CHEM LAB AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

<b><u><big>WEDNESDAYS</b></u><small>

Same as Mondays

<b><u><big>THURSDAYS</b></u><small>

11:00-12:15 --> Theatre
2:00- 4:00 --> 2 HOUR BIO LAB

And now for the best day...

<b><u><big>FRIDAYS</b></u><small>

9:00-9:50 --> Chemistry
11:00-11:50 --> Biology

AND THATS IT!!! HAHAHAHAHA

yup, 62 days till i move in as of today! BUT I'M GONNA BE SOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOMESICK!!!!

And TAMU-CC evacuates the school at least once a year for hurricanes, but we evacuate 72 hours before anyone else in the city does. Which isn't so bad. It only takes 12 hours to get 8200 people out. Not bad at all...

So while i'll be living there, it won't be my home, not in the least. HAHA comming back to San Antonio, i was driving 85, just cause i wanted to get hime. And i don't think that feeling will go away...at least i hope it doesn't.

"event","so i was looking at all the criteria to get into the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at A&M College Station, the only Vet college in Texas, the best in the US, and the college that i've wanted to go to since 5th grade. Yeah. Well, uhm...you see..the review commitee basically looks at all your grades and vet experiance, and then sees how many points you have. Out of all the people that apply there, and trust me, there is ALOT, the board only picks the top 225 students to get into the interview pool, and those who don't make it, have no chance getting in. To get accepted you have to be interviewed. And from those 225 students, they chose the top 132 for acceptance. SOOOOOO, outta like, 500 people or more, i have to be in the top 132

No way am i that good in school...



.........might as well start looking for another career.........

"event","so its official....i have graduated from Incarnate Word High School. Tiffany and i made a promise Freshman year after Maura dropped out that we were gonna be up on the wall in our class picture and that we were gonna graduate. and i'll admit, there were times when i wanted to quit....but that promise i made kept me goin strong.

I wanna thank all my friends at I Dub, cause without you guys i never would have made it this far. You let me see that i could be ME, and that there was nothing wrong with that. There are not enough words to say how thankful i am for that.

So after graduation i went to Tiff's house for her family gathering. hahaha, i shoul say our family, cause my parents look upon her as another daughter and her parents looks at me as another daughter. She got Disney Scene It and Cranium, both which play roles in a story comming up.

Hap and Jay came to graduation. It was good to see Hap again hahaha seeing as how i haven't seen him since Wednesday. so after grad i called Kyle and told him where to go to get to Tiff's house and then Hap and i went to his house to get his swim stuff. We get to Tiffs house at the same time as Kyle which was really freaky cause the same thing happened the day before. So my parents met Kyle the day before and tiffs parents met him yesterday. So we swim and i dunked Kyle first, like i told him i would. Then we go play Disney Scene It, which the boys were trash talking, saying that we were gonna lose......WHICH WE DIDN'T!!!! TAAAAKE THAT!!! (thanks Katie!)

and then we went to go see Over the Hedge, which was hilarious! It was also funny how it was Jay and Tiff, Me and Kyle, and then Katie and Hap. I swear they do like each other. AWWWWW HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

So all in all it was a fantastic day."

"event","<P><FONT color=#3366ff>so i've been having nightmares almost nightly now, and it scares me so much because so many of them are about my mom dying.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>After i had the first one last week, it woke me up at like, 6 in the morning when my mom was getting ready for work. And i ran to her and hugged her and told her i had a bad dream about her dying and she was like, ""its okay, it was just a bad dream, go back to sleep"" which of course i couldn't, and besides, i was gonna get up in like 30 mins anyway to watch Buffy and Angel and Charmed, which fits into this story actually. So my parents leave and i go in the living room and i'm watching Angel and i switch the channel over to Buffy.....and its the episode where her mother dies. And that like, REALLY freaked me out. And those of you who know me pretty well know how oppsesive and worried i get over stuff like that. So, i go through the day, not really thinking about it, and then that afternoon on Law and Order, someone's mother gets murdered. And that freaked me out even more. So my mom gets home and i didn't think about it very much after that and we went out to get dinner and when we got home i was telling my mom and dad about all the crazy stuff that freaked me out and my mom says, ""i'm glad i didn't tell you this this morning Rachel, cause i knew tht you'd freak out and worry about it, but this morning when i was in the shower, i had a prememnition that i was going to die."" and of coue, that just......scared the hell out of me. So i like, spent the whole night sitting by my mom watching her.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>And that fer has not gone away. My mom (and what i'm trying to tll myself) thinks that she had that bad feeling cause thats when o was having my bad deam and i mean, that makes sense that she could tell when i was haveing a really bad nightmare.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>And my dad tells me that haveing nightmares like that are very commen around the time of senior year and when you go away to college cause thats when you start to make your own decisions and you really start to fear losing it all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>and it seems that almost every year at Incarnate Word someone's mother dies and that really scares me and......i don't know.....life is just really scary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>On another note, my mom found like, 3 huge boxes filled with baby pictures of me and my brother and some of her when she was young and some of my dad's family and everything. and my grandfather (my dad's dad who died when he was 13) looks sooooooo much like Mel Gibson......make that a mean looking Mel Gibson. Yeah, Grandpa Roy looked like a total hard-ass. And i swear, in every single baby picture of me i have my mouth open. I think i must have been REALLY annoying when i was a little kid, i look like i was. However, there </FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>are a few where i look relaltively cute.</FONT></P>

in Nature. Down to earth, laid back and a natural<br>beauty. You have no need for

great love for nature. You probably know more about<br>plants and animals than most
people and you'd rather spend your times outdoors<br>and in the sun, independent
and free. You can be a bit distant with people,<br>preferring the company of
animals over people, which isn't always the best<br>thing. You can be kind and
sweet, but not many see that side of you as you<br>often have misunderstandings
with people. You are very go-with-the-flow sort of<br>person and usually try to
avoid fights even if it means changing your opinion<br>or belief. Still, you are
you look your best actually without make-up and in<br>casual clothes. Very few can
say that. Be proud.</p>

"event","God, have i mentioned yet how much i hate this crap? well i do. College applications and all that crap SUCKS!!! GOD!!! I'm so sick of doing this stuff and its just, i don't have like ANYTHING on my resume and no college is gonna want me, CERTINATLY not A&M and i haven't taken my SATS or ACT and i have to finish up my service hours from last year and do these and i need to write my essays and its just.......I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD IS GONNA POP!!!!!!!!!!!

and i think i'd like it to cause that would solve all these problems.

and when i was looking over the things required to get into the CVM at A&M i burst into tears cause theres no way i'm gonna be able to meet all the requirements to get. They only take the top 132 students to do the interview pool and then only the top 128 after that to get in. And mind you, these top 132 are out of the entire contry and world even....those are a HELL of a lot of people!!!!!

And then theres that entirely other matter thats PISSING ME OFF that i can't talk about it, and itrs just building up and building up!

and i always get pushed to the side, i mean, why the hell should i even BE here anyway?!

and all this stress is building and i haven't even sytarted school yet and GOD!!! WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SO STUPID?!?!?!?! WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE END TO DO EVERYTHING?!?!?! THATS WHATS GONNA MAKE ME MISS OUT ON A&M!!

And William's looking for apartments in Lubock and i gonna be leaving the same time i'm starting school so i don't knoiw what i'm gonna do cause my parents have to take him up there and i really don't want him to leave, he's never LEFT before.

and i hate growing up and i've been having nightmares again and i can't sleep and i'm getting sick AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A SENIOR!!

its just, i know i'm not making sense....i just don't want to do ANY of it anymore, i wanna curl up in my dad's lap and have my mom read to me like she did when i was 5 but i can't cause i'm gonna be 18 in 4 months and i don't want to be.

i just hate this."

We were hangin' in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear.

But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock n roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly young.

Talked a good game, when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy,
guys* were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change.

<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>When i was talking to my mom about it on Saturday she said that she was glad Tiffany wasn't dating him anymore, because there would have been a chance she would have been in the car.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>And thats what i told Tiff today. We were standing outside the door at St. A's and she said that she loved him so much and she didn't understand why he let her go. And i started really crying and said that if he hadn't, that she might have been there, and that would have been something i could never had delt with. Everything happens in this lifetime for a reason.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>To tell you all the truth, i was seriously contemplating the exsistance of God on Saturday night, and i wonder if its just my blind faith, buit i know deep in my soul that he is there, and that makes it easier to go through this, because i have someone to yell at and to ask ""why"" to, and even though he doesn't answer, i can still feel him there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>I didn't know Michael <EM>that</EM> well, i just knew him when Tiff was dating him and then during Pride and Prejudice. I think i even hated him for a while for wht he did to Tiff, and i'm very very angry at him for what he did to everyone else. but theres something about death that changes all that, you look back in yuour memory and just think about little times. God, he wqs just here a second ago, and now he's not. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>I think thats the hardest thing for me to deal with, the fleetingness of life. I mean, sure, evberyone says to embrace life, to live it like its your last day. But if you every really think about it, you don't. I know i don't. I let so many things get in the way of doing what i really want to do or saying what i really want to say. Because if you think about, so many times we part with those we love with angry words, or not saying the words that we truley wanted to say at some point.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ccff size=4>So i know this all sounds really cliche, but guys, make sure that those you love know youi love them. Hug your parents and tell them how much they mean to you. Don't let anything get in the way of your friendships, especially petty things that don't matter.</FONT></P>

And he's the product of the Haggard generation
He's got a redneck side when you get him agitated
He got the gold toothed look from a stiff right hook
He's proud he took for his right wing stand on Vietnam
Says he lost his brother there

He yells out Johnny Cash
And the band starts to play
A ring of fire as he walks up
And stands there by the stage
And he says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
Life was good and love was easy

She's got an MBA and a plush corner office
She's got a don't mess with me attitude
She'll close a deal she don't reveal that she can feel
The loneliness the emptiness
Except when she comes in here
She's the product of the Me generation
She's got a rock and roll side when you get her agitated
She got the tattoo there on her derriere from a spring break dare 
In Panama where love was all she thought she'd ever need

She yells out to the band
Know any Bruce Springsteen
Then she jumps up on the bar
And she, and she starts to scream
She says

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy

Yeah, yeah
Can or can't you get my mind off thinkin' 'bout
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Hey, hell yeah

Hell yeah
Turn it up
Right on
Hell yeah
Sounds good
Sing that song
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good 

Hell yeah!
Turn it up!
Right on!
Hell yeah!
Sounds good!
Sing that song!
Guitar man playin' all night long
Take me back to where the music hit me
When life was good and love was easy</FONT></PRE>"

everybody wants an easy ride
on the merry-go-round that we call life
take a drive on cruise control
then you wait to find it's a winding road
i had my dreams in view
when the money ran out and the engine blew

hung my tears out to dry
then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky
and I, I was walkin' the clouds
feelin' so safe and sound
then somethin' else knocks me down

well, oh, that's the way it is
you gotta roll with the punches
that's the way it goes
you gotta bend when the wind blows
you live you learn
you crash and burn
it's hit or miss
and that's the way it is

one fine day you wake up
completely, hoplessly fallin' in love
he's just what you're lookin' for
the only problem is, that the man's not sure
another guy'll give you everything
the only problem is you don't feel a thing
well I know from experience
nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense
oh, one day you get what you want
but it's not what you think
then you get what you need

well, oh, that's the way it is
you gotta roll with the punches
that's the way it goes
you gotta bend when the wind blows
you live you learn
you crash and burn
it's hit or miss
and that's the way it is

yeah they say your soul is growin'
but sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'

and that's the way it is
you gotta roll with the punches
that's the way it goes
you gotta bend when the wind blows
that's the way it is
you gotta roll with the punches
that's the way it goes
you gotta bend when the wind blows
you live you learn
you crash and burn
it's hit or miss

"event","It's cold and I'm cold and I want this week to be over. Scratch that, I want this semester to be over. I can't stand all this nonsense. Ridiculous English and Linguistics class. What good are they!? NO GOOD. I just hope I did well on my English essay...or else I FAIL. And thus NO UCLA FOR ME.

I'm sure I had something of more importance to say. But then again, there really isn't anything important about ANYTHING right now and I'm just hoping a meteor might fall from the sky and land in my backyard that happened to contain aliens from some distant galaxy...or something.

Let's all have a tea party."

Then Kate came overr becuase she got a job at LifeTime Fitness, yayy, i miss her. And me, her and Reena talked for a while, and a tickle fight almost occured, lucky it didn't. and we just stopped talking for a while and looked at the TV, since it was on and all, and we didnt even watch the movie and this guy was like ""im not gay, i swear"" haha, it was funny. then she left. Then Amanada and her friend Nikaa came and then Nikaa left for home after a while and Amanada went to this one guys house so me, Reena and my mom left and the snow looked so perfect so we tried not to step on it and my mom backed up and i stepped and i slipped and i fell on the same spot on my booty where me, Jake K, and Sasa all fell trying to get the rebound. lol. and Reena was all trying to help me up but we were laughing to hard. Then she had to go home and I went home and went online then took a shower and went to bed.</FONT></P>

"event","today sucked like a crack, snapple, pop. Molly's being so gay about this whole thing.. heres the Story -- Me, Reena, Molly, Samantha, and Dakota were all sitting together at recess and Reena goes to Samantha ""Can I have some gum?"" and there was only one peice left, and I was like ""Yeah, me and Reena can split it in half!"" and Reena was like ""Yeah!"" and then she gave it to us and Molly was like ""Hailee, can I have some?"" and I didnt really wanna give her one beucase it was like this big >> |------|, so I gave her like this |-| much and she chewed it up and stuck it on my pants, so I took it off and put it on hers and i was just like ""wow"" and she was like ""Wow to you, for not sharing!"" and she is telling everyone that she didnt want it and she flicked it and it landed on my pants and I smeared it on hers. And some people actually believed her, so I wrote her a note yesterday at the school basketball game and I gave it to her and she was showing the whole school and during LME i walked in and Nour had it in her hands reading it so I just took it. And everyone she shows it to, she talks about everyone, everyone at our lunch table and the two lunch tables behind us, I can name 1 thing about everyone that she said. It's so elementry school though. Whatever, at least I will know who my real friends are. But anyways, in 1st hour we watching the annoucments as usual, and I sat next to Samantha, and Kyle and Calla and Lejla sat across from me and Kyle was all rubbing those strngs on ur sweatshirt on my arm beucase they were soft, lol, and we did this pimped out thing where we hade assembly lines, but it was only fun beucase of the people in my group and I had to draw the green balloons and Kyle had to cut the paper and he took my card to read it but stole it and gave me his card and then Mrs.Buikema was yelling at us to sit down and Kyle sat down at the 12 spot but Mrs.Buikema told him to go to the right place. haha. In 2nd hour we did taste testing thing and in 3rd hour we played Rootball and I wanted to be on Austins team but noo right when he was about to pick me the other team did, at least Evan was on that side! haha, so funny we were throwing pencils at people and yeahh, haha, it was funny, I was walking with Sonja after gym to put her gym clothes in my locker and I was laughing and Billy was laughing and we walked by eachother and gave eachother a dirty look and then just kept on laughing, but its like we have Pimp senses or something , like he said, because we always know when eachother is coming, its funny. then in 4th hour boringness. at Lunch i sat by Eni and Reena and Sonja.. and At gym I sat by Calla, Eni, Reena, Sonja and Nour.5th hour, the weirdest experiments ever! lol Calla, Andrea and Lejla. Rubbing stuff and putting things through other things. haha ilu girls. Then 6th hour, omg! Her hair. Chyna is the best, she was like ""You look funny."" i love her! me and Calla were partners for sharing Scope and we moved our desks in the back of the room in a little cubby whole, behind Andrea, Austin, Evan and Sam Miller. So she couldnt see 1.us writing note to eachother 2.us laughing at her hair and 3.us not listening.. then in Pride we watching a movie and I sat by Andrea, Calla, Evan, and Austin. Then after met up with Reena and Eni and yeahh.

"event","today was Reena's first day of school. heehee,she was in Eni and Julia's class. close enough..

Car Ride Here--my mom picked us up todayy, and,ha,it was funny. We picked up Kyle first and there was all this ice,you know.. and he was slipping all the way to the car and he was like falling then stadning up and he would take a step again and fall and me and him were cracking up,guess you had to be there..

Okay,so after Open Gym Me, Molly and Reena walked down to Blue Hall,and Molly went down there then me and Reene went to my locker and we shoved her coat in there and tried to fit her nackpack but it was too crammed, so she put it in Mr.O's room. Then I walked around with Reena and other people at moments and then I went to socail studies and talked the whole time and then did a worksheet.. sorta. Then Eni and Reena came to my locker and walked to Blue Hall with them and in math me and Danielle were partners for this one thing and we never really did it.. so I took it home to do it. then went to gym where we played Batmitten.. bo0ring, and me and Brianne were partners. Went to my locker and got my LME folder then we had to show our video and it was so messed up, the bloopers were in the middle because SOMEBODY in our group didn't listen to me when I told her how to cut out parts. Me and Kellie were cracking up because when I was video taping her I was all vooming in up her nose and I was putting Nour on camera while Kellie was talking. Then left that suck-iness class and waited for Eni and Reena and Reena forgot her locker com. and she went through Mr.O's stuff to find it while me and Eni kept watch. Then at lunch sat by Reena ; Eni ; Sonja ; Eli ; Sarah annd thats it. Then at recess we played those ugly fags that lie and it was a tie and they said it wasn't, and we're just like ""yeahh,whatever."" and our team was me ; Reena ; Eni ; Sonja ; Kyle ; Jake k ; and Nour. Then went to science and walked Reena to her math in science,as always, boring. Then went to my locker with Calla, Reena and Samantha. Then me and Calla went to language arts and I brought my camera and took pictures of Austin ; Jake K ; Samuel ; Jake H ; Billy; and Steve. haha, i was gonna take a picture of Calla but there was nonya film left, because there was only like  7 pictures left from the hotel. Mrs.Wesala is so mean I asked if me and Calla could go in the hall and she's like ""no and I was like ""Why?"" and she said that if I picked a new partner that I could! Loser, then she let us after a lot of begging and we worked with eachother, Lejla and Samuel and Jake H and yeha, then PRIDE, woah, a weird day, Mrs.Wesala didn't give out detentions and the student teacher didn't give out B.E.P points! haha, then I went to get Reena and Eni was there then me and Reena went down purple hall and she used my cell phone to call her mom and then I went outside and walked to the car with Evan then when I got in the car everyone was waiting for me and yeahh. Then Reena's mom called and everyone was staring at be, very annoying. Yeah boring day,but thats ok. Basketball practice later, I hope Andrea brings her stereo! And that our coach would let us listen to music... Well, gotta go to Socail Studies.. That Darn Homework!

<P><STRONG>Friday-</STRONG>around 1:00 Stephanie came over, then Reena and then me, Steph and Reena went to pick up Molly and we all went to the coffee shop and was extremly bored and was playing with straws then we went online and me and Molly went onto random peoples screenames. lol. and then we left and when we got there it took like 87437854873 hours to check in so then we were in room 310.. good times in thurr. anyways. so we got on our bathing suits and went swimming and then after a couple of minutes we played Chicken.. it was at first me and Stephanie and we won. then me and Molly, and we lost and then me and Reena and we won. haha. and we did a chicken run , me and Steph's thing. then we got out and got dressed and played this sort of hide and go seek tag thing but not really.. and after that we all just sat behind the Coke machine and this kid came up to buy a coke and we said hi and&nbsp; started asking him all these questions.. his name is Ryan he is the coolest person on Earth. so all these hockey dudes are at the hotel for their tournament, and thats why we was there and he lives in Canada. so then we took some awesomly awesome pictures and then we went into the jacuzzi where some fat guys were stalking us and it was rreeaallllyy annoying. then we got out and got dressed and we were trying to take a picture of Ryan beucase he is sssooo cute. but he started running away and we started chasing him and he told his sister on us and the sister was like ""stop chasing my brother"" and then we thought that they told his dad beucase people kept staring at us that were adults and we were freaking out. so then we went down to the first floor to get some food from the vending machine and the people before us were banging on it beucase&nbsp;their food wouldnt come out and they walked away to get the manager and then some lady came out and started yelling at us for banging and then the manager started laughing at her beucase she was having a cow then we all went to sleepp..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Saturday</STRONG>-when we woke up we went to breakfast and i am telling you eevveerryyoonnee at that hotel hates us.. beucase they put out new bacon and this kid in front of us took 2 bowls and then me and Stephanie took like half a plate full and it was all gone and everyone was talking about us and it was really annoying. Then we went to our basketball game, we were doing pretty good actually.. but the other team was just doing better... then me, Stephanie, Molly and Reena drove on back to the hotel. And guess who was there! Carter and Teddy. eww. they stalked us everywhere. Then we played that tag-ish game again and this time i was on a team with Reena and we were hiding by this movie theater place and this baby came up to us and stole reenas chips lol.. then after a game of that Reena did a scvenger hunt for us and she made s run up and down the stairs like 7548543 times! grr.. And then Ryan gave us his MSN screename-ish thing, and we asked him to pull an all-nighter with us but he said he had a hockey game at 7:30 and it was the finals.. we are seriously in love with him. then we attempted to play putt-putt but that didnt work out to well, we ended up throwing the balls at eachother. Then we went to Max and Ermas and&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a mall connected to it and we went there for a while.Then we went back to the hotel and we talked to Ryan for a while and then got our bathing suits on and Stephanie was like ""I bet its goona close in like 5 minutes"" and Molly was like ""noo"" and we passed Ryan and he was like ""your going swimming right now?!!?!?"" haha. then 5 minutes after we got in there the whistle blew for us to get out!! haha, then we went on the computer and we were just sitting down and Ryan and his friends come up to us and started asking us these random questions lol and he was like ""you wanna know what would be cool to do today?... you chasing us"" haha then we started writing and Molly's face and he stole Stephanie camera but he didnt know how to work it beucase it was turned off and we were like ""Ok, if we ctach you we getto take a picture of you"" but he didnt let us! and then we were calling his name and his dad coems up and was like""do you want his number?"" and were like ""no, we just want a picture of him"" and he was&nbsp;like ""well if he doesnt get you the picture i'll give you his number!"" and were like ""ok!"" and then his dad started yelling at him! and we were like ""no, thats ok,forget it"" then we just sat there for a while and the secruity gaurds made us go to up to our&nbsp;room and we just stayed in the hall then we wrote Ryan a note hat told him to call us before his hockey game and it left my cell phone number and Reena and Molly went to the second floor beucase his room number was 220 and they were trying to slip it under the door but Molly thought it was a different one then Reena and they were fighting so the security gaurd started yelling at them and they had to come up so then Stephanie and Reena went down through the back to put it in and they said te TV was on so I was aboutto go with Reena to knock on their door and tell them to give Ryan the note but the place was infested with them! ((secruity guards)) so yeahh. Then his friend was the room next to us and I was trying to tell him soemthing through the window but his parents were in the room orsomething becuase he told me to stop. then there was this kid that was&nbsp;Ryans&nbsp;friend whos door was across fro mus and down and he was like 8 or something and we were blowing kisses to him and he would blow them back, aww he was so cute! then we shooke our booties at him and he covered his eyes. lol! and he came ou to tell him something but he got yelled at by a secuirty gaurd. then Teddy and Carter came up to the 3rd floor beucase they knew our room number and we told them to bring us chips becuase we were starving and they did and Carter just comes into our room and sits down and we're like wtf get out beucase my mom was sleeping lol, he was just making himself all comfertable and then they were running down the hall and they were soo loud! grr.</P>

<P><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>`- --&gt; well, me and Sonja had to wake up at 6:30 but I don't really hear alarm clocks so my mom comesin at 7:00 and starts asking me why I wasnt up and ready and then she let me have another half an hour. So Sonja got dressed and I got dressed and we did all that clean stuff. Then we went to the coffee shop so My mom could brew the coffee and we opened it and I was so happy because there was no one there and I could act like it was my house and sing all i wanted to. Anyways, me and Sonja ate then went online for a bit. Then got into the car all the coffee fell over so my mom told me to pick it up so then me and Sonja just held it and seriously, i think my mom was purposly making sharp turns then we brang the coffee into the Plymouth high school and set up a mini booth thingy and me and Sonja walked around for a little bit and every hot guy who passed we would be like ""Thats a good one"" or ""I like him"" haha. guess you had to be there and we went into to this place where it said ""Wrestlers, Coaches and Refs only"" but we went in there anyways beucase we had to use the bathroom and this coachy duude came up to us and was like ""CANT YOU READ THE SIGN?!!"" and im like ""yeah.."" and hes like ""what does it say?!"" but i just started walking away and hes like ""COME HERE!"" and Sonja was like ""we're working at the coffee stand"" and hes like ""...the connsession stand?"" and im like No. a stand with coffee.. and coffee stand!"" and hes like&nbsp;""well why were you back here?"" and i said ""we had to go to the bathroom!!"" and he started mumbling all this stuff and we just walked away. what a weird one.. so then there was thiis kid ""Little Bennit"" and i was moving my cell phone around and it was on camera so when we was walking to the garbage can he was all smiling because he thought i was gonna take a picture of him. haha, it was funny. Me and Sonja were in heaven.. &lt;33 lol Sonja! so then we went home while they were doing the finals, i wanted to watch them, but you know.. So then me and Sonja went to my house and ate Slim Jims and Resee Cups. And did our homework and all that... fun stuff</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Nick's Party</STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;`- --&gt; haha, we had a hard time fing his house so it took us like 20 minutes then we were a little early so we parked behind the curb and then it was 7:00 so we went out but then we lost it AGAIN. and me and Sonja went out to check the mail boxes and it wasnt it and we didnt feel like getting back into the car so my moms window was rolled down so we was ridng on the side of the car hanging onto the window and the door handle it was really fun then my mom was like ""THE COPS!! get off."" so i was about to jump off but the car was still going and shes like ""Hailee! whats your problem?!!"" so the car stopped and we eventually found his house and when we went into the basement where there was me, Sonja, Nick, Eli, Lauren B, Craig, Jake H, Lauren M, Jensen, Kelly, Gabby, Zack, Billy, Melanie, Becca, and all these other duudes that i didnt know. When we walked into the basement i seriously thought I was gonna have a seizure becuase the lights were all blikning and the music was really loud.. haha. so me and Sonja st at this one thing and there was this dip so I stuck my finger in it beucase I didnt know what it was and I whipped it on the chair then like 2.5 seconds later Eli came and sat right where I whipped it and me and Sonja started cracking up and he got mad and left.. so then some poepel came and sat by us ((in cluding Eli, Jake H, Nick, Lauren B, and Kelly)) then all that stuff. So basically the whole time I sat around and talked to Sonja, Billy and Eli. haha, me adn Sonja's goal by the end of the night was to kick Eli and Billy in the nuts. haha, we reached our goal. so then Billy took my shoe and I chased him aorund and then Eli did.. then this really perverted kid coems up to me and was like ""hey lets dance"" and im like ""thats ok ill pass"" and he was like all up on my and i stood up and walked away and he followed me and then i pushed him and he left. It was freaky. and then they did one of those things where they carry Zack around,but he almost fell on me. Luckily Sonja saved me.. Then I called Eli and he wasl ike freaking out beucase he didnt know who it was and he kept on calling me and cussing me out and i was like ""wtf?!! your so stupid."" lol it was funny though . haha, me and Sonja went upstairs to get our shoesbeucase our feet was freezing.. right after the mosh pit and Kenny was up there talking to himself while going up the stairs and he was like ""My balls hurt like no other"" and me and Sonja started laughing and his mom was like ""What?!"" and he was like ""i said 'MY BALLS HURT LIEK NO OTHER'.."" and me and Sonja laughed even harder and his mom was like ""dont say that in public!"" haha it was funny. and his mom came downstairs liek an hour later and was like ""can you turn the music down?!!"" and nick turned it off becuase he couldnt hear her and then Gabby comes out and yells really loud ""TURN THE MUSIC BACK ON!!!"" and then looks at his mom and was like ""oh"" and walked away it was funny and everyone wsa like ""...thats Gabby!"" and then a while later Nick was wearing her sweater ((gabby)) and his mom comes down again and was like ""...what are you wearing?!!"" and nick was like ""gabbys sweatcoat!"" and his mom was like ""Take it off you look gay!"" haha.. then Sonja left and I just talked to Eli and then Lauren B and Billy for a while.. then me, Lauren, and Billy were looking at pictures on Nick's phone and ((haha Lauren and Billy)) then they were attpempting to play Spin-The-Bottle.. but it wasnt working out to wel.. me and Lauren didnt play.. haha. it was fun but then my mom came to pick-ith me up and I watched an hour of teevee then i went to bed and now I am writing in this and talking to reena.. </P>

Yeahh, it was the best. Then we talked to Scott half the time and the other half we talked to eachother. haha, and then about an hour later she was repeating what she did to bring up the laughs again but it started dripping a little.. but not pouring out.

All these kids were yellng out stuff, and standing up and the vice principal made a sign at the other end of the gym that said 'Sit Down' but they wouldnt listen so they got kicked out, and one of the dads of the 79351025456 kids was like ""what happened?"" and the kid was like ""we got kicked out for standing"" so he stood up and told all the parents to come stand up and they did, so they let them sit down...<STRONG> ::</STRONG> 2.The current vice principal and the old vice principal were having&nbsp;a fight so all the kids went to back their current vice principal up, and then came back. <STRONG>::</STRONG> 3.They were screaming out inoproppriate things like ""Try wearing a Condom!"" and mean things like ""Get a haircut"" exept the guy actually did have long hair. so they got kicked out then came back out anyways.-- yeahh, it was pretty funny. Then we went to the coffee shop and I talked to Lisa for a while and got $10, 2 jones soda and a pop for my mom.. </P>

Then Reena went home and I watched TV and went to the coffee shop and listened to my brothers friends band play and then went home and watched Naepolian Dynamite and Without A Paddle.. with my brothers friends then went to sleep after a looong match of DDR..</P>

We just want your number!"" and Stephanie started laughing and all this food came out of her mouth becuase she was eating and we starting running then they eventually stopped chasing us and everyone left and me and Reena were the only people there and we seen Derrek and he said hi and we talked for a few minutes then we sat down and watched some guys play basketball and they were soo good! and then Sunny came and picked us up and too kme home and I finished the rest of my homework and took a shower and now im writing in this!</P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>""Cyrus just lost this huge war, he lost his land and all of his soldiers, half of them got killed and half ran away. Cyrus escaped and went to an abandoned house with no roof. It was raining and Cyrus just sat against the wall, wanting to die because he just lost his land, and all his soldiers. So while he was thinking and just watching the wall he seen an ant carrying a piece of corn twice his size. The ant went up the wall, and fell, so he tried again, but a different path, and fell again, the ant did this 70 times. On the seventy first time, he made it up, and a few minutes later, it was back for more food for his family. Once again the ant kept on falling and eventually made it up the wall, finding the right path. So Cyrus thought 'This little ant, didn`t give up, and here I am, I lost one war, and this ant had to try 70 different times to get up a wall, and still came back for more food to his family, I lost one war, and I`m giving up?' So Cyrus went back and had another war, and he won, and he won his land back, that`s why we call him 'Cyrus The Great.'""</FONT></P>

"event","<P>At the o0ne and o0nly's... Loner with a Boner, <STRONG>SONJA</STRONG>!! and mee other lo0ve <STRONG>*ReenA*</STRONG> has just arrived!! and Sonja keeps on exiting my little lj out! jeez o` peez! just kiddin`!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1st Hour.Socail Studies</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt; wow.. probably the funniest part of my day! lol, me, Calla, Sam, and Billy named our Island ""Colors of the Ocean"" and whenever we say it we wave our arms.. lol.. our island is soo crazy!! Everyone got 25 pounds of potatoes and wheat and I got a shovel and a knife and Calla got a hammer and a shovel and Samantha got a shovel and a knife and Billy got a knife.. suckker. Well, we HAD to have mermaids soo Billy could be entertained.. haha! and he said we should have Mermans and Sam and Calla said it should be MerButlers.. if it was merMAIDS.. makes sense! then we had a fabulous conversation on how mer-people can have kids.. and Mrs,Buikema thought I get high on white out becuase it was sitting on my desk.. lol.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2nd Hour.Math</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; Someone woke up on the wrong siide of the bed ((who i think always does)) Mrs.Hogan! To Calla it was like::</P>
<P>Calla:Mrs.Hogan..&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs.Hogan!!</P>
<P>Mrs.Hogan:WHAT DO YOU WANT CALLA?!</P>
<P>Calla:...nevermind</P>
<P>Mrs.Hogan:OKAY GOOD! NOW GO SIT DOWN!</P>
<P>and for clock partners, Sam's partner thing is screwed up, and I am both Billy and Sam 5 o` clock partners soo we are always the 3 of us together, but for some very odd reason Mrs.Hogan had a cow today! and she was like ""No 3 people at a table!"" and I said ""But when you say 5 o` clock partners all 3 of us always work together and you never say anything.."" then Mrs.Hogan was like ""Okay! Get to the front of the room!"" beucase whenever you dont have a partner you have to go to the front of the room and we were all confused so we went kindaa slow becuase we were trying to figure out what was going on and then Mrs.Hogan was like ""This is <STRONG>your</STRONG> problem <U>not</U> mine!!"" and i was about to say that we never said it was yours, but im learning to keep my mouth closed.. so Billy was like ""Well.. Hailee's my 5 o` clock partner"" and Mrs.Hogan was hypervenitlating and she was like ""Hailee... ((deep breathe)).. Billy is your... ((deep breathe))... partner... now... ((deep breathe))... go sit... ((deep breathe))... down... ((deep breathe))... NOW!!"" and i'm like jeez!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>3rd Hour.Global Languages</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; Basically we just had to turn French words into English words ((or find out what they meant in English.. same thing)) and me and Sonja were partners, we totally dominated!! then at the end of class I got called down to Mr.Watson's office, and to make a really long story&nbsp;really short, I dont have a referal anymore and he thought it was halarious that my dad said to Mrs.Wesala that ""Hailee was just being kind, and I think you should try teaching people kindness, becuase their are a lot of smart people that are ruude, and not enough kind people. So I think you should try teaching people how to be niice."" and I think he thought it was funny because you could tell that he thought that my dad dissed Mrs.Wesala, this guy was cracking up..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4th Hour. Power</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; Pretty bo0ring.. the only thing that matters is that I finished my worksheet and that I have a 91% in that class..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>LUNCH/RECESS</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; I sat next to Sonja and at moments Molly, and I heard someone talking about me!! But that's ok.. i guess, Craig thinks that Mr.Watson is Bi-Sexual.. because hes nice.. lol. gotta lo0ve that kid..  At recess some man-whores beat us up in Basketball ((literally)) some guy was all up on me mann!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>5th Hour.Science</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; another bo0ring class.. we just caught up on our missing work, which is good becuase I have an E in that class.. too bad i didnt get too far!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>6th Hour.Language Arts</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; We went to the computer lab to research our survey, I'm doing mine on the Tsunami, Melanie is doing hers on Child Abuse, I wish I would have thought of that... or abortion ((Sonja! she thought of it)) and everyone was listening to music and playing games and stuff and i guess they have this tracking device on our computers at school, and I tried to find headphones to listen to it but i couldn't ((luckily)) so I just listened to Calla's for a little, but who ever did got detentions, soo yeahh. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>PRIDE</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; Mr.Watson came in and gave us a lecture about not doing stuff on the computer and thats basically how we spent our PRIDE..</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Basketball Tryouts</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; It was pretty bo0ring//tiiring you could say.. and challenging.. yet fun.. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sonja`s House</P>
<P>&nbsp; `- --&gt;&nbsp; That`s where I am right now! lol, Reena`s here too.. we rented Napoleon Dynamite and Farenheit 9/11. and we took pictures and stuff and ate and yeahh.. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

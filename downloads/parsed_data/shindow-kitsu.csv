"event","I had a strange dream last night.

At first I was visiting Dad. I remember a lot of people being there. People from my past I've known, mostly classmates. I remember Kenan, Lauren, the ones that stuck out.

Then, it was like there was this bar/restaraunt attatched to the house. Dad had a huge mansion in my dream and it was the setting for everything. I guess that means I felt protected or something. 

If I had to describe it, the first floor when you walk in reminds me of a Red Lobster with the bait and tackle look, but then theres hardwood floors a few feet away that leads to a hallway to a door outside and one door straight ahead to an office with a billiard table and that coocooclock he has. Past that I think are the bedrooms. There's also an upstairs somewhere that shows up later.

I remember eating at one of the tables with a few people. Not really sure who, but I think it was Niffer and some adults.

Later I was with Jen on a sleeper sofa (those who dont know, the AC went out so we slept on one for a week), and we had one of the toys hiding in it. Easily the worst part of the dream as Mom demanded to know what it was so I ended up telling Aunt Candy instead in secrecy. Just shows what lengths I'll go to to not be judged by my mother every waking minute for my life and beliefs.

Even later, possibly as the result of said things or just my state of mind, I found a bottle of what my brain imagined as: Schnapps Vodka. >.>??? Also, according to my brain, drinking slightly over 1/3rd the bottle will make you very very drunk. In my case, a violent one. I think Jen and I had a fight and I do remember looking everywhere for her. I mean I searched the mansion wasted top to bottom trying to find her asking other kids if theyd seen her. I forgot to mention from the time the alchohol showed up, a house party had exploded. The house was a different monster, you know? I remember sharing that bottle with Kenan and NaR. 

The last part of my dream, whether I found Jen or not, was some kids getting turned into statuettes. Kinda like in return to oz, except not ornaments, just stone objects of what they're strongest material desire was. I remember Pirro turning into some kind of musical instrument <-- I know this came from my RPG Maker game, as I was asking Jesse to help me with it yesterday. On that same note, I remember my Cold CDs on a bookshelf. I had showed them to Jesse to burn them yesterday too.

All in all, the only thing missing was drugs. Sex, Alchohol, and rocknroll accounted for.

PS
I went to Dad's a week ago for Vacation, too. I dont think I mentioned that here in detail. I'll write about it when I'm less busy."

In lighter news, just two things:
*Ellsan makes the best Grand Wizard ever. I was very pleased he could do the deep South accent so well.
*At least in Japan, there will be a Pokeball pedometer with Gold and Silver. It seems to work like the Pikachu GS.

Oh, I've been writing. Little drabbles here and there for each book, mostly around Ellsan, though there was one with S.W. 

I am appalled at my characterization which is usually where I excel. I've realized Ive made placeholder characters and have been filling them in. 

My SVU sets should get here tomorrow, don't expect to see my for a few days. OZ should be with them, so I may take some time out to write my SVU/OZ crossover, featuring Ellsan with at least 2 personalities, maybe more if I bother to add them. Jen wants me to add the flaming personality from Fear and Loathing; I considered adding Chris himself as one, but I dont want to complicate it moreso than it is. Hard to believe he was acting on both shows at once. Imagine playing a rapist one day and catching them the next. 

I'm planning to watch I Love Lucy until 12, then Jon and Kate, then SVU and more SVU. Yay. 

I haven't felt well for the past few days..."

"event","I had another wierd dream.. wish I knew what they meant. At first, it was just Angel and I getting laid (I think there was a third person, probably Ellsan), Nar was helping us find time alone. We were at my grandma's house, I guess a long time after she'd died. Their basement led to a sewer and their master bedroom was a kitchen, while the livingroom was surrounded by a bathroom and what seemed like a giant pantry. So those 3 doors plus a door to outside are cut off. There's a lot of other people there, like we survived something which is why I say end of the world. Either that or a freaked out reality show. Nonetheless, when Angel and I more or less succeeded, we wandered around the property with Nar and a few others. At first we went outside and found the ferry; we decided to see where it was going, and somewhere along the way we decided to jump off in case it wasnt going anywhere so we were all seperated into two lines with lifejackets on. I remember being scared, but remember being told that if I didnt get on and it did go somewhere, Id be left behind. We jumped in the water and I helped almost beat the other team back to shore. It was fun, I remember saying, ""I havent played in the water in such a long time."" After that, we went back inside the house, unlocked the doors and looked around. We arrived at what was the kitchen in my dream and I found something called Scotch Butter. It sounded like it was body butter, but when I decided to drink it it tasted like watered down scotch, apparently. No burn whatsoever, what a disappointment. I found a blue beaded necklace I apparently used to wear, and when we moved to a nearby closet I found a large quilted balloon I apparently used to beg grandma to inflate so I could play with it, it had lots of characters and stuff on it. I really don't remember much after that..."

"event","I know I haven't written in such a long time. Since the Hurricane I think. No, since the concert, right? I guess I've been distracted.

The concert... was the most fucking awesome thing, aside Angelchan. The band of duckbutts before them had a CD out, so Angel got it signed. It was cool, the lead singer did the back up vocals on one of Cold's songs.. I think it was Suffocate, IIRC. I surprised the band with my 7"" vinyl of Give. It was so cool seeing Jeremy and Sam and Scooter and everybody. I got 2 shirts for Scooter's new band, The Killer and the Star. I gave Scooter a drawing of S.W. which he seemed to really like because he smiled and gave me a hug. He was cushy for such a skinny guy. But I can say I will never forget what that felt like. ^_^ It makes me all giddy inside. 

I'll just talk about lately. 

We went to see Angels and Demons and it was fucking awesome, as I expected, having read the book in high school and loved it, thinking it more as a form of entertainment than hype, like most people. -.-; It was wierd, Angel told me, ""You're not spiritual. Spiritual people are assholes."" So I had to think about it, but she told me, ""You're not spiritual, you're just a good Christian. You are what Christians are supposed to be; You don't impose your view on others, you're a kind person."" So I felt a little flattered; it made me sound perfect, but even she knows I'm not perfect. We picked up some manga, we've been reading Dorothy of OZ, After School Nightmare, and Ghosttalkers Daydream. We were going to go by Pei Wei, but there stove was being fixed. Somehow by the end of the entire day we decided to pick up the entire series of OZ from Amazon.com... ><; Oh, right, we decided Ell-san's plot was cool. Now, we're terrified. 

Yesterday we went to see Star Trek. It was great even for people who don't know the series or anything. I like Spock; hes emo and cool. Angel, on the other hand, only went to see Simon Pegg. X.X We had to walk all the way around the outside of the mall in the dark because we just had to park and go through one of the clothing shops. We also brought back one of Nickelback's older CDs (which I got for Leader of Men) and Angel got Eminem's Marshall Matters LP (Kill You, woo). I won her a valentine cupid carebear at the arcade cuz I am teh awesome, and I also picked up Writer's Digest. I get so depressed looking at the book stores, trying to find something. Nothing really interests me, and when I think of the authors in the thriller section.. or if there is some sort of drama fiction section I dont know about, then I get discouraged. They are either big names or people who have written at least ten books. Angel says I shouldn't be sad, that I should just keep writing, get my writing published somehow, and then see what sticks. She said, ""Maybe you'll get a cult following."" and thats really all I want. ^_^

Thanks to a multitude of hormones its been crazy at home. Angel decided I have to write The Official Unofficial PR0n book to my novels, with her 4-koma stick figure stuff in the back (cuter than I make it sound). 

Admist searching for an image of Ell-san's cubist crucifix tattoo, I decided to read his usual Q&A, which he jokingly supported EllsanxMunch; Angel was thrilled. Also, way to go Ellsan, on that death in the blaze of glory you want. I hope if they do kill you off this Tuesday or any other whatever day they've changed SVU to air, they'll go at it your way. I was actually shocked reading the summary, as it is a Munch centered sounding episode, which rocks, and not even that is the best part. His ex wife who appeared back on the sister series in 97 is back. Now, why can't the Evangelion actors be so kind?

And the worst news ever. Blue Sphere is being remade, comes out in Japan in a few days.... on mobile phones. I'm making an Elphy decree: ""Square Enix likes to say fuck you to their fans."" Angel read that on some site, and I fucking agree. You fuckers suck. Now, release it seperate on a NON NINTENDO console, because if we all know here that if there is one company that sucks more than Square Enix, its Nintendo of AMerica, because they don't like Tales, they don't like Fatal Frame, theyre not gonna like Star Ocean, either! Don't they see that every family more or less owns every Nintendo console as it is, no ones gonna give a shit if every other game in a series is on a Sony one. >< 

+++++++++++++++

I wrote the complete summary-draft for <b>End of the World</b>. I'd like to move on to <b>Halloway's Aslyum</b> after, then maybe try to get those published first. I dunno. I really wanted to publish <b>T.P.S.C.</b> first, but I need to completely work everything out. 

I'm really tired. 

I still need to work on Devil Summoner and Riviera. 

I think I'll just watch SVU... Ellsan always cheers me up.

Ah, I just remembered a dream I had awhile back. Me, coughing up blood and laughing because I was dying. 

Creepy."

I finally found the website and link, the concert is listed as all ages (which is basically 18+) so I'm glad to report Angel, Jesse, and I will be seeing Cold live the weekend after Matsuri. 

Legato-- I will give your DVDs back asap; they are safe on my shelf. Also, $15 will easily cover the DVD: pay me whenever; surprises are fun. 

I've written so much. The book is finally coming along and I'm rewriting TPSC as well as my other books. It's been tough around home because I'm stuck with mom all week and all she wants to do is clean and install flooring even though the house will be just as crappy a few weeks from now. 

I've had a touch of insomnia, my bedtime being 2 AM and getting up at Noon... I'm also nervous about seeing/meeting SW! I'm contemplating a few things: what to talk about if I do talk to the band, possibly giving him a necklace I got, and wondering if I should get a CD signed...

Were gonna try to go to Matsuri, but right now it's Sat only. We have to go for Crispin Freeman. So Jen and I went out yesterday and she got a large aisha plush and I got the new cheetor model. Playntrade had beast wars for ps1 complete so I snagged that.

"event","I had some strange dreams last night and the night before.

The night before, Jesse was sick of the way people treated him and took it out on innocent Neopets goers. He was also hiding in our attic causing a rucus (probably caused from my real-life dealing with the mamoths upstairs). It was so upsetting in my dream that dream-me went crying to my mom about it.

Last night I slept from 1:30 to noon, so I had a long dream. At first I was at home. We have our elevator chained up since it got ruined during the storm. My grandparents were trying to fix it (before I knew that I kept trying to tell people to lock our non-existant screen door because a ravage fish would attack us-- Ive had several dreams of bad things trying to get into the house ranging from tornadoes, spiders, and evil dogs..) but I knew my grandpa would get hurt. (My grandpa here has been having difficulty balancing but overall in good health, the one in amarillo was recently put in the hospital, he has alzheimers really bad and my grandma hes married to is losing her memory too). Well I dont know what happened but when I came back my grandma had his body on our kitchen table covered with a seafoam green blanket and crying he was dead. 

Later in my dream I was at some kind of fancy reception with Jennifer, we were at a table talking to someone. I want to say it was Tom Cruise, but >> Hell, I cant remember. I remember a lot of Angely smex too in that dream. I also remember something about me being upset and I remember my grandma pulling me aside and telling me that she heard I want to inherit her house and she was about to say she was giving it to me when I woke up.

Lately, on a slightly better note, Ive been playing Persona 2: Innocent Sin, SMT 1, and Neopet's Keyquest. =)"

On DDS2, Im stuck on the Heat-monster battle. It just annihilates me. I might have to grind and get Cielo to learn Zionga, and someone to learn Mediarama.

However, I just got Steambot Chronicles and really want to play it. The main character is like a chibi Yamato but less emo =)

I had a really kick ass dream last night (probably from staying up until 2 AM watching some movie about cold fusion and spies and russians). All I remember is my character Matthew being the main center and he had awoken in a factory (what stands out is him thinking ""this makes sense now"" and the fans with the shadows and it being dark). I also remember something about walking through... a house? A train? Im not sure, but it was me. I remember thinking something about Jennifer/Angel, too. Might use this in the book somewhere.

Also, I decided that Matthew will learn from ShindoW's mistakes, that even in death you cannot escape your mistakes in life.

Im sad, cuz I want to preorder Luminous Arc 2 but it comes out in a few days and I dont have the money to pay it off right away. Im wondering if I should preorder, but I doubt they'll hold the bonus CDs past a week. ;( At least I can still get the game at some point.

I wrote about 6 pages on the beginning of my book and its going smoothly. We finally heard from Bill that my usb will be fixed sometime this week, so maybe my writing can be recovered. Jens PC has some of TPSC on it, like Chpts Ol1, 6, 7, and 8 or something, when its 1-14 chpts long so far. 

I had my heart set on that 360 for Xmas.. unfortunetly, rumors are that tons of UTMBians were laid off, and Mom feels she is one of them. I doubt the uselessness that is Unemployment will send us enough to live off of. If we werent getting money for Stevie from the government, we'd barely make it after funds ran out in savings, Id say. Its a shame when the system is $170-$200... But then again, arent Wii's $150? >< Stupid Wii, why must your games suck right now and you be cheaper?

Once again, a very long day. My painting is frustrating me. Its Meloni at ShindoW's grave with ShindoW behind him; theres lots of snowy xmas trees and there was supposed to be a church but I kept screwing it up so Im not sure what is going there.

I finally went up to the house today. The dunes are non-existant and what little are left has made a canyon out of the road; The house is the cleanest I've seen (underneath) since I was 4. Even our insilation is gone =) The fence and garden are totalled but not gone. The house got very very little water near the front door; so it must have been like literally living on the beach for a few hours. It was tiring but after a long day I got my internet hooked up here at the apartment. I think we'll be here until Xmas.

I am throwing a Halloween Party on the 31st. All my friends are invited but you need to be able to drive home and I can't have more than 2 more people spend the night; not that any of you will read this and show up. However, to fill you in on what is being wasted on Jesse and not you fine folks... We are making an Elphaba cake from Wicked; its basically her Defying Gravity look, broom and all if we can get everything together. Jennifer is baking the cake, icing ect, I am making Elphy's bust, arms, ect out of something similar to gumpaste. The cake will be pink (strawberry for Glinda) with green icing to hold it together with black icing covering the cake and black fondant for the cape. We're gonna watch horror movies; mostly really old ones.

I haven't been writing much but I've had quite a few ideas since we last talked; namely for ShindoW's angel form and her story. Since she is a suicide, I want to have Matthew, maybe Kreeno, awaken her from one of the Mind Forest's Suicide Trees. She is sentenced by the Angelic Commitee to have a gun permenantly in her right hand never to be let go-- it is bolted in as well as the fact that everytime she takes a shot, some of her blood is lost due to a tube connecting to the vein in her wrist. She also has undersized white wings. Later, at some point, when angels are revealed as the problem, ShindoW finds out and is thrown into a tank next to another tank with Kreeno's real body, which they had been hiding. The wings are ripped off until nothing but veins are lef, hanging off.

But back to SO1. I LOVE the game, REALLY LOVE the characters, but HATE the translation. Get this, <b>they had the nerve to edit the cross in Cure All, but they left in a drinking scene, dogs pissing on your characters, ect.</b> Let me express my sincerest deepest rage for this. They had the cross in Star Ocean 2; animated the exact same; that game had cursing and an E rating. I just don't understand it. I can just express my anger for that and many retarded NAME CHANGES: Ratix = Roddick, Fear = Phia, Marvel Frozen = Mavelle Froesen, Sylvarant = Silvilant, Amulet of Antivenom (aka Posion Check) = Amulet of Antivenin, and many other absurd changes. Let me keep note that they also kept the entire conversation about gods and why there is religion as well as talk about the demon world-- not to mention 2 characters with wings (angels aka featherfolk); but no fucking cross. 

Can you tell I'm mad?

Thank you"

It doesnt help I've had lots of wierd dreams lately, including last night when I had a dream about Nar. I had explained to Jen earlier how if Nar had been a better person previously to meeting me, we might have gotten together; I dont deny there was a deep friendship at one point, for me, there still is a friendship, but the drugs and lifestyle have put a wedge between us for a long time. In my dream, a friend that taught me how to french kiss was stalking me -- now, this isnt the future-stalker-bf I almost had, its a different guy -- and Nar was protecting me the whole way. I remember being at my Grandma's house in the dream, I remember being at this restaraunt my family used to go to which is now partially gone in reality, but I would say that I need to work on End of the World again, just to get those feelings out from under my skin for once. It's like being stuck in time in a certain part of your heart -- I broke his heart, for good reason, but it doesnt mean I was heartless -- and thats why I was writing the book, more for him than anyone else. 
I have yet to write a book solely for Jennifer, but Eve of Perception comes really close. Although there was going to be a lot about ShindoW and her parents in End of the World.
Anyway, Jen is out of the shower and I g2g, so I'll try to post again soon~"

I read all your comments from last time, even you Itachi. =)

First off, we aren't being turned into a Sanctuary like rumours said, even though Jen and I agree that would've been better off for everyone on that ""armpit of the earth"". 

To update, my house was probably one of like 3 on the entire peninsula not damaged... much. The garage is gone, but it needed to be cleaned anyway. The downside: our un-used bowflex and our water heater is gone. There's talk that water heaters will be mandated to be in attics from now on. Like that's going to help much. Nonetheless, some lattice work on the stairs is gone, the garage is gone, and the elevator is fucked. But the house itself is doing okay. We got a beautiful brand new door that comes complete with a frame. 

We were in Amarillo for a few days; not much really happened there, but I can say we're back in Beamont at my cousin's, but we will soon be in my Uncle's company-given apartment until furhter notice. I will try to get high speed, but we'll at least have dial up. 

So they know: Jesse, Legato-sama, and Turtle. I got your stuff out when we originally evacuated so it is okay. 

Finally, probably the worst news, <b>Oni-Con 2008 was pushed back to DECEMBER 19TH - 21ST</B>. I personally hate this change as far as Christmas goes, but it does give more time for costumes and reservations. 

However, my costume maker is living somewhere completely different. I may just go as my own character even though I was looking forward to Lynx.

Anyway, its getting close to bed time so I am going to go for now. I am not sure when I will be able to get online again, hopefully soon."

Let me make this entry short and simple since we've been on the road for 7 hours today. 

We evacuated. 

People made fun of me for ""packing the entire house"", which consisted of most of my room that includes Jens stuff. Well... I showed them.

We evacuated to Beamont. There, I stayed with 9 other people (as well as 5 dogs of various shapes, sizes, and one dubbed ""Psycho"" and 3 cats (including Olie Bolie)) in a 3 bedroom, 2 bath home in the burbs. We had no power for 2 1/2 days. We got lucky.

We worried about our homes. Thanks to NOAA (sp?) website, we found out my moms house/my house and my aunts house are in tact. However, one house on our block was demolished by the storm. The rest of the peninsula as well as Galveston island were practically totalled. It looks like a bomb went off. 

However, the rumor is; my town is being turned into a Wildlife Preserve. So no one is going back except maybe a day to reclaim what the storm didn't destroy. I think they are paying for the homes as well.

Finally, I am on my way to Grandma's. She lives in Amarillo. I've talked to Jesse, Jennifer is with me, and I've also talked to Turtle. Vannah gave us a call/text. So spread the word. I don't know how long me and Jen will be gone, but we will keep you all up to date.

Jen's having a rough time right now, so I need to go tend to her.

Leave comments so I know if you're alive or dead!"

I picked up Odin Shere again and I really enjoy the game when I know what I'm doing; today I got a better handle on some of the less battle-centered things.

So, Sept 22nd we start saving for Oni-Con. =) Can't wait to go this year~ I'm hoping for figures, doujinshi, and apparel mostly. Oh, and Black Market Pocky Salesman. He's cool too. He always sneaks us the best food.

Pokemon Platinum was announced so I am holding off on playing Pokemon Diamond for a bit. There's not much new, its like Emerald or Crystal, more of an enhanced remake or expansion pack kinda thing, as usual.

School is okay. I finally got recognized by my art teacher for my good talent, but it only took him 2 semesters. I guess with Nicole out of the picture its easier to encourage me instead of ignoring me entirely. 

I haven't slept perfectly the past few days, but I have been getting to bed earlier.

So this hurricane thing is coming our way, probably cat 3, 100 MPH winds. I hope we don't have to evacuate, and if we do, what the Hell am I going to bring?

Olivar and his meds is the #1 thing. I would use my own dead body to carry him to safety. He's my precious little orange kitty and I love him. <3

My rare games, my statues, and my computer, at least. Maybe just my harddriveas or the tower, so I don't have to lug the screen. 

My SNES, my PSPs, my DS, and my blue N64 are going. Everything else is replacable. Little TV is probably going too, but only if we can fit it. 

I'll bring a few books and clothes of course. My Digimon, Mew, and Megaten figures for sure. My signed Silverbolt. My Megaten guidebooks. All my ABe artbooks, but thats it for those.

Lastly, some posters and a few ceramic things.

Thank god theres a van and a small car to shove all that in, including Jen's stuff. Though most items we share anyway, so half of that is hers, too.

I'm sleepy. Oh, my sketchbooks and writing lastly. I hope Jen calls that guy about my USB Drive. If all my writing for Halloway's Asylum and End of the World is gone I think I'm gonna fall apart."

Let me just say as I slap myself and scratch my arms that the mesquitoes are HORRIBLE right now, eating me alive even inside the house sometimes.

Jen and I have decent classes, but nothings really picked up. Our $110 textbook we have to share is insane-- it through off our budget big time, but I sold a rare D-Arc and was able to get the Ayumi Hamasaki Single Collection in time for being entered into the promotion. We also went by Gamestop where I found <i>Unlimited SaGa</i>, black label, for $4, complete. Really good deal for any RPG IMO. I also picked up <i>Digimon World Championship</i>, which is like a giant portable V-Pet. Capturing is a bit difficult, but I enjoy the game so far. Now if all the decent Digimon would, you know, stop reverting to eggs...

In Humanities I got an idea for a Wizard of Oz painting picturing Elphaba's death, but theres more to it than that, I'd say. Sucks we're only using black and white this semester, cuz I need green for that image. And red. Argh. I need to think of a black and white work."

We got it to a guy to get it fixed (thank god for friends of the family) and hopefully I should get it back in a few weeks. I can't wait to continue the writing spree / art spree I've been on.

Ellsan's new hat makes him look so old fashioned, especially with the trenchcoat. 

I apologize for any mispellings in this post or wierd sounding sentences. My arms feel like lead, I'm just exhausted from getting bed late, getting up early, going back to sleep... Ugh. 

Now that I have an image editor, I might make either a background with Elphaba or Ellsan. Maybe both. Wouldn't that be tight. 

I've been drawing ShindoW with her denim jacket again. I guess I wanted to make it more apparent in this book since <s>Ellsan</s> Meloni is spending so much time with <s>me</s> ShindoW. 

But back to my dreams, I guess. My first dream, which I had had one similar to before, I was pestering Ellsan. He had that damned bowl hat too lol. He was unusually tall, though. I'm almost 21, I only went up to his stomach. -shrug- 

In the second dream, I was with Kreeno in my house. She seemed like a ghost. She kinda looked like she did at prom. I remember her hair most of all because it had gold highlights. 

Also for the second time again, I dreamt about something big happening across the street from my house at night. Almost like an 18 wheeler was parked there with a circus or something. 

It doesn't stop there cuz last night I had a dream about Mr. Sharp (Sharpe in my book -- a crazed meteorologist who doesn't care about putting his team of two in danger.) I was showing off to him that I was insane and going to kill people (knives and junk in my backpack). The setting wasn't a normal classroom, it felt like a third world country. I remember being drug out and arrested (like I had cuffs, but like they were invisible and painless). My classmates were curious, but they were more pissed off because the class was broken up into two groups. 

I'm not sure what my dreams mean. I'm so tired."

A lot of it was about Meloni, Matthew's character makes a first appearence in the series, Nathan got a lot of characterization, Matthew's Dad -Evin- got some characterization. Meloni and Nancy interacted. It was a good sit down for me.

I'm waiting for Jen to get home, I am about to complete .hack//INFECTION (finally), so its on ""pause"" until then.

I'm pretty tired. I heard Jen was smiling at work, so that made me happy.

I'm either gonna go back to writing or I'm gonna just sit and watch SVU.

Jen, you'll be happy to know that I gave Ellsan ""the hat"" from the Mariska thing, its just not really desrcibed, so its kinda an inside joke. Nonetheless, seeing him rip Nancy's oxygen away for a few seconds wearing that and his trench sounds amusing.

I want to ask you all a hypothetical (?) question.

I had a set up for a trade with someone that involved $110 shipped for a JVC Xeye system. I didnt have images and I didnt have any idea what kind of cables were included. 

Someone who fixed my old Sega CD also offered me his near-mint Xeye w/images, 2 controllers, hookups including an RF switch (not only rare, but I need it to play on my TV) for $105.00

This is someone who really needs to save as much as possible so, I accepted the $105.00 and canceled the other.

The first guy with the original offer got really ticked and has since blocked me from any trades just because I found a better deal, not to mention a better seller. =/

But to make things worse, now the second guy cancelled saying he wants to keep the system.

All in all: I'm out of a JVC Xeye, I have my old Sega CD back, and Ive made a ""new friend"" on GameTZ who obviously doesn't know how to communicate like a real person.

I could not be more ticked. I'm gonna start up this saying where instead of ""Black Letter Days"", for gamers, theirs ""Trudy Days"", because this reminds me of one of her crazy GameStop stories that make me gawk and feel pity ;__; -hugs Trudy-

It wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't just lost most of my files to a virus about a week ago, if I hadn't slightly slightly ticked off a judge who rescheduled my jury duty because he didn't understand my situation, if I didnt have to take 12 hours worth of classes and watch my brother 5/7 days a week, if my gf and I hadnt been crying all night because my mom forgot to give stevie his medicine and he almost died, and if this damn tropical storm hadnt made me fear for Angels life when she went to work because her boss is a dick...

We got a new hentai series and some kiwi gummies and a ramune. I also got Atelier Iris 1 complete for $17 at Gamestop.  

Alot of my items came in and I got money so Im ready to ship out. Its proven difficult because I lost all of my invoices and notes. I think I recovered decently.

So, scratch the Aya cosplay. Im considering Elphaba / Wicked Witch of the West. My gf wants to do NessaRose, and Jesse has agreed to do a winged monkey. It sounds okay, but Im worried Elphy is over cosplayed. I want my costume to be very unique!

Jesse, mom's rule pending, is coming over Saturday and were having a little marathon of Wicked, WoOz, and Return to Oz while we try to work on costumes.

Also, ATLUS announced Devil Summoner 2 (well, the sequel to the one we got here) in Japan. There is yet another uber box set for Nocturne-- thank you Dante, you prick -- in Japan. Im so sick of Nocturne; I want Digital Devil to make a comeback.

They finally cleaned up The Body on the side of the road-- right when we brought the camera, sadly -- but its legend will live on in my shitty B-Movie script lol

I had to ban someone from <lj user=""digimoncollect"">. That takes a lot of work, sadly. 

Im so exhausted. I need to finish cleaning the floor, change my brother's diaper, and get the trash out... @.@ 

I better go.
PS
I had a good chat with Dad today. Its nice that we're connecting more than usual. I really miss him."

"event","So rumor is there is a new season of Reboot. Jennifer will be happy.

So, we just realized... we need to decide what we are going as to Oni Con. I have quite a few choices:
- Aya Brea (Parasite Eve 2)
- Manskirt Squall (FF:Dissidia)
- Angel (Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga)
- Asuka [baby form, w/doll] (Evangelion)
- Opera or Dias (Star Ocean 2)
and theres probably more, but those are the highlights.

http://community.livejournal.com/pefans/1689.html?style=mine#cutid1
Seeing this fellow cosplayer doing Mitochondria EVE makes me want to do Aya even more... but... I don't think I could pull it off. I always feel bad when I don't look close enough to the character I want to cosplay. Im really close to Angel and Squall if you need some kind of idea. 

<b>What do you guys think of cosplaying a character that you don't look very much like? Is it a pet peeve to you or do you not care all that much?</b>

Also, Digimon Adventure, Episodes 40-43 were released:

"event","I got my layout up. ;) Also, <b>What would be your dream anime?</b> I got this from my F-list.

<b>- What demographic will your story be aimed towards? (Shounen, seinen, shoujo, josei, etc.)</b>
Probably whatever crowd Lain, Boogiepop, and Evangelion fall in. I'm not sure if mindf*ck is a catergory.

<b>- What genre or mix of genres will your story be?</b>
Romance, Psychological

<b>- What format would you choose? A movie, a thirteen-episode series, an OVA, a twenty-six episode series? A neverending series (LOL)?</b>
I'm fond of the 13 episode series, but it would be more like a really long OVA for me lol

<b>- What will your characters be like? What ages will they be? Are you drawn to a certain character type you think you'd use?</b>
I've typically got an angst ridden main character with some kind of love interest that takes interest in him/her and a small group of friends that either helps or (more often) fails to get them through their problem of choice. <-- Wow, I have some kind of lame formula going. But as far as age, probably ranging from 16 to an upwards of 40. I like working with teenagers forced into adult level problems.

<b>- What are the settings? What time period does it take place in? Any specific color palette or ""look"" you'd want it to have?</b>
Most likely a modern setting, probably somewhere remote like a small town. Lots of golds, reds, blues, and grays.

<b>- What are the important themes of the story (such as: man versus nature, people in relation to tragedy, people and technology, etc.)? What is important to you in storytelling that you'd want included (ie, strong character background stories, an overpowering message, a complex plot, etc.)?</b>
Peoplw in relation to tragedy describes it best. I'd like to focus almost completely on characterization, then plot, but good music and well drawn art are important. 

<b>- What sort of tone would your series have? (Dark, nostalgic, crazy, silly, sweet, etc.)</b>
Dark and silly and sweet. Some kind of angst ridden thing with fluff thrown in at points to lighten the mood. 

<B>- What are your goals in creating this project? Do you want people to laugh, to cry, to think about _____, to consider something they might not have before?</B>
I'd like to show people what not to do when facing a problem, I guess. I'd like to make them go ""What the Hell just happened? I thought it was about this, now its about something completely different. I love how these characters connect to eachother.""

And in relation to the staff, who would you like to be your:
<b>- Co-director (as a note, they could be involved as little or as much as you'd want. You would always have main control over all aspects of the story and how it is told.)</b> I'm not sure, probably my girlfriend Angel, actually. Someone who knows me and likes what I like.

<b>- Character designer (What do you like about their character designs?)</b> I'd like to do basic designs, but my dream designer would be Yoshitoshi ABe. His work is amazing. 

<b>- Soundtrack composer (And what type of music would it be?)</b> The one who did either Chrono Cross or Illusion of Gaia. It would be very powerful with a variety of ""sorrowful"" sounding instruments like piano, flutes, and violins.

<b>- OP/ED performances (And what would you want them to be like?)</b> This is a really cool question... Depends if US artists or JP were doing them. US) Cold for the opening, Seether for the ending. JP) Nightmare for the opening, Ayumi Hamasaki for the ending.

<b>- Any animation staff you'd want to be involved
- Seiyuu you'd want to be involved
- Background artist(s)?
- Which studio(s) would you like to be involved?
- ...Anyone else of note for other roles in animation production? (There's no way I'm listing every job you could have within an anime project.)</b>
I'd like Chiaki Konaka to work on the script ;) His work is amazing too. I know he gets along well with ABe, so I think both of them interpreting my ideas into an anime would be my dream."

"event","I'm in the process of making a new layout -- probably Illusion of Gaia -- for my journal. Um... Jennifer and I have made some trips up to Beaumont and improved our game collections. I've got a lot on Ebay to pay off, but its coming along easily.

Jen and I also got some sports stuff so we can work out on her days off and its going well too. We find that badmitten at night in the wind is very very difficult. 

We saw a new Wicked Witch barbie we want when it comes out :3 and Jen wants the new Alice/Queen ones. 

Jen gave me some ideas for my book so I'll be writing that.

Recently we saw something we dubbed ""The Body"" because for the past 3 trips (over the past 2 or 3 weeks) we kept seeing this large form of roadkill on the side of the road leading to Winnie. A huge amount of 18 wheelers go down this road, people speed, it isnt unusual except for the size. We weren't sure if it was human or not because most of it was mangled and it was just a big mess on the shoulder. Finally we got to stop long enough to see its some kind of livestock, a large large pig/boar or some kind of young cow. There's a ton of cows nearby, so we say the latter. 

Nonetheless, there will be a short story about it. I've already completely planned it out. Amazing.

Also, S.W. fears witches."

If Im not mistaken, these are EXCLUSIVE TITLES. PS3 is starting to suck! I think its also getting LAST REMNANT, and we all know its getting INFINITE UNDISCOVERY.

<img src=""http://img319.auctions.yahoo.co.jp/users/4/9/0/5/strawberrytears2006-img600x530-12150924433vpwjd84013.jpg"">

I think it was the only Lynx item I was missing! I'm so glad I snagged it because Chrono Trigger DS is coming out which means there will be more interested in Chrono Cross and the price would've shot up again.

<3 

I know I haven't updated in awhile... Jen and I shot some fireworks on the 4th. My crystal just flew into Bernie's yard, so I got to keep it this year XD Jen has her peacock one which was pretty. The beach was packed for the two minutes we were there.

Jen also had this horrible stomach virus for a day so I took care of her :)

Then like a few days later Jen took me up to this franchise called PlayNTrade and I got a near-complete, mint condition copy of Lunar 2 for $50 and its up on my trade list since I've already got a copy XD I also got Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest for the SNES and about 3 Genesis carts. 

However, I came to the conclusion I've killed yet another Sega CD. Trying to work out a trade for a JVC X'Eye but I don't think the guy said it might not work so... -emo- I hate replacing them because the CDs are soooo heavy, shipping is just as much as the system!

It doesn't help I already had 1 dying N64 and one dead N64 lying around. 

However, I did get ActRaiser 1 and 2 for SNES online and I'm hoping to beef up my SNES RPG collection... I found a ton of games stuffed away and I listed a good portion on GameTZ.

I've been playing Lufia 1, and I really like the game. Children of Mana is the other one I've been playing when I'm on the go.

I finally got another of my Digimon holy grails, the Japanese Blue one. Cost me a whole lot and after the Lynx diaorama, I am not spending a bit for the next 6 months (okay, okay, aside my SNES games I'm watching)... ;__; I can't afford to be this broke XD

Oh and I have realized I really miss Cold's music. But they're CD is scheduled for November (well, Scooter + two random guys' CD.. Lovin' the new band name though)

Also, been drawing a lot of artwork of Nathan, NaR's character. I wrote one of the more difficult scenes last night, and I still feel a little guilty. ^^;

FINALLY, after what seems like a drought in the US world of RPGs...

<b>Kingdom Hearts: ReCOM ***might*** be coming to America.</b>

Thank you, WTW.net:
<i>
I've confirmed this with MULTIPLE people.

I don't know if it's the full Final Mix+, or just Re:COM...


But we are getting Re:Chains Of Memories in the USA.

Square (or Disney, not sure), have been auditioning TONS of people for the last few weeks for voices of Organization XIII members (Vexen, Lexaeus, Zexion, Marluxia, and Larxene) saying the game is 'Chains of Memories'.

I've even been told the character artwork they are showing is the generic 'cgi pose' of the Organization members that are up at damn near EVERY Kingdom Hearts fansite.
</i>

How much better could this year get?! Persona 4, Star Ocean 1, Star Ocean 2, Chrono Trigger DS, FF:Tactics Advance 2, ...

Hmm... Parasite Eve 3 for a fucking console would be nice."

"event","A day ago or so Jen and I went to see <i>The Happening</i>. It is a good film IMO outside the ending which really needed a better conclusion. Other than that, I really enjoyed it.

We saw a preview for a film with Ellsan in it, starring once again opposite Richard Gere (Runaway Bride being the other, and in this its the almost exact same situation):

Jennifer demands there be yaoi.

However, looking up other films Ellsan had been in, I discovered he was in the new Harold and Kumar movie, not reprising his role as Freakshow, but instead the Grand Wizard of the KKK. I'm not sure whether to laugh or just be like WTF? 

Finally, Ellsan (appears) to be playing a serial killer in this remake: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepfather_%282008_film%29

I'd like to go see it when it comes out, cuz we know evil Ellsan is fun, but not as good as Imakillu Ellsan.

Renamon items are expensive.

And theres nothing on TV.

I finished the ending to my novel, Eve of Perception."

Angelchan, what was that about a new wallet?

Now I know why Ducken/Color Pandora's voice was bothering me in Monster Rancher. It's fucking Cryllin (sp?) from DBZ.

For Jen, Mocchi's VA is Pixie, Kagura (Inuyasha), Hinako (Ranma). Undine is Sango (Inuyasha). Samuel Vincent (Sidoh in Death Note) is Hare. That's so fucking cool. Sidoh = <3 <3 <3 He's also Sonic's singing voice in Underground. I'm keeping my Hare plushie. ^^

Japanese Tiger (Rygar)'s VA is Lieutenant Yoki from FMA, Japanese Sidoh from Death Note (Say it with me: Weeeee! Plop!)~

ABe-sama has yet another work coming out, but I dont know alot about it or where to get it aside amazon.co.jp and I'm not sure how to order from there. I wish I could afford his doujinshi. I should take 5 years off from collecting just to get his doujinshi. Seriously.

"event","So the news that Star Ocean 4 (The Last Hope) is on Xbox360 is a HUGE disappointment. I'm hoping that they cut down the visuals for the PS3 version, because honestly I'd rather have a game on a system I plan to own rather than something I don't really want. I would love to play it for the plot, but if the gameplay is like SO3, I don't feel like giving it a chance anyway. I just hope Enix and Sony of Japan realize how many people planned on it being a PS3 release. There really isn't any excuse. Someone compared it to FF's jump to Sony, but... that was a visual thing. PS3 can handle good graphics too =( Even if they aren't ""better"". 

So I'm at Jennifer's. Shes with her mom fixing her shit-tastic phone. 

It's been kinda bad overall. I don't fit in whatsoever; I'm an outcast to these people. I feel like I've been pulled off the streets into a palace and suddenly I have all these things expected of me.

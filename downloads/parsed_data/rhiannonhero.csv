Almost a year ago, Matty Marcus showed up in my head again looking pretty and saying, ""Hey, I have a really fun idea for a novella! Wanna write it for me? It'll be easy, fast, hilarious and you'll have no regrets! I promise!""

Matty Marcus? He's a little bit of a liar, guys.

The book turned out to be pretty intense and it required a lot of work. Not to mention it's 121,000 words long! Far from a novella! More like a longish novel! But the good news is that I persevered and I'm pleased to report that Matty Marcus got his book! Yep! It's officially released into the world!

"event","From <i>Buddhism: Plain and Simple</i> by Steve Hagen:

There is an old story about a man who came to see the Buddha because he had heard that the Buddha was a great teacher.  Like all of us, he had some problems in his life, and he thought the Buddha might be able to help him straighten them out.  

He told the Buddha that he was a farmer.  ""I like farming,"" he said, ""but sometimes it doesn't rain enough, and my crops fail.  Last year we nearly starved.  And sometimes it rains too much, so my yields aren't what I'd like them to be.""

The Buddha listened patiently to the man.

""I'm married, too,"" said the man.  ""She's a good wife, but sometimes she nags me too much.  And sometimes I get tired of her.""

The Buddha listened quietly.

""I have kids,"" said the man.  ""Good kids, too, but sometimes they don't show me enough respect.  And sometimes....""

The man went on like this, laying out all of his difficulties and worries.  Finally he wound down and waited for the Buddha to say the words that would put everything right for him.  

Instead, the Buddha said, ""I can't help you.""

""What do you mean?"" said the astonished man.

""Everybody's got problems,"" said the Buddha.  ""In fact, we've all got eighty-three problems, each one of us.  Eighty-three problems, and there's nothing you can do about it.  If you work really hard on one of them, maybe you can fix it--but if you do, another one will pop right into its place.  For example, you're going to lose your loved ones eventually.  And you're going to die someday.  Now there's a problem, and there's nothing you, or I, or anyone else can do about it.""

The man became furious.  ""I thought you were a great teacher!"" he shouted.  ""I thought you could help me!  What good is your teaching then?""

The Buddha said, ""Well, maybe it will help you with the eighty-fourth problem.""

""The eighty-<i>fourth</i> problem?"" said the man.  ""What's the eighty-fourth problem?""

Said the Buddha, ""You want to not have any problems."""

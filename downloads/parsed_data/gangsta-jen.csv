"event","I went to deep creek. it was mildly fun. Brendon makes me mad sometimes because sometimes i just need silence.

I figured something out.
A tricyle is not a tricycle without its third wheel. even if that third wheel is always left alone in the back.

Freds coming back soon and that makes me giddy.

although someone else i care for as a good friend doesnt seem to care enough when i care. I seem to give and not as much recive. im not complaining. just a thought. i just want this person to be a little more thankful for me. 

on a differnt note, Joey is an awesome person. everyone must love him and hug him or else your a loser."

how people dont recongnize how people care..
well..to you..all i can say is stop freakin feeling sorry for yourself. Everyone fucking loves you and you dont          take a fucking minute out of ur day to lisen to people.I hope one day people stop caring so you can see what you fucked up.

how people make plans and cancel them for someone better.
to you.. you dont relize how fucked up that is. and u say you care but then u go fuck yourself over, and dont care what the people close to u think.

Ignorance.
Selfishness.
Hyporcites.
and just plain stupidness.

its what im starting to see in u guys,
even the people that where closest to me.
(by the way thetwo examples up there are based on how two of my best friends are acting. yea i hope u read this.)"

uhhh well last night, we went to the rink. Tons-O-fun. Not. Well in the begining i was being stupid and i couldnt stop crying. unlike kal--i mean someone else...i didnt want to cry. but n e way, there where some nice people there like alana,camille, brechin, eli and suprisingly joey. It was just strange. Jons a fucker, well, hes not, but alana says i jusst have to tell myself he is. Ah, Freds no good. I dont know if i wanna go out with him. I think i like someone else but i dont think i should. Well, anyway back to the rink junk-in-a-trunk....soooo then i decided to put on a ""fake smile"" and show everyone everythingisdandyandilovemylife. 
sooo then at brechins house that night i was skateboarding in the basement and i jumped up on this beam and a nail went into my hand. damnit that hurt soooo much. it still does. Right now Butch mom and I are in one big fight. so all it just great, just great. and you guys do nothing to help me. Oh thank you."

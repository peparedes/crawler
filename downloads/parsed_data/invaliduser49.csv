"event","I have been really nervous about highschool. I guess im the only one really. I hear all the other people saying ""Oh im so happy to go to highshool!"" and im over here sooo nervous!! I guess mostly the reason is Lomax and LaPorte combining. The only thing mostly im happy about is that I get to see Sarah but I have a feeling we wont be together alot. Lomax people hate me. Dont ask me why, but they do. I havent even done anything..but owell..Ill just shut my mouth!! In highschool ill probably just start paying attention more and make good grades. I really dont wanna be a failure. It sounds funny yall hearing this from me becuase i really dont care most of the time, but i really wanna start listening and make good grades. 
    
This Summer has been soo BORING! I havent really done anything with Sarah but go to the wavepool with her. We really havent hung out cuz she would have to go home in a hour. It really sucked. I hate summers! ugh! All they are, are HOT days without school! and you get fat cuz were sitting on our butts and eating alot.

I have been talking to this guy Justin for the past couple of days and I have started to like him!! One thing about him that i really dont like is that he lives in Manvel..and i cant see him! Its alright i guess. Hes a really cool guy tho! My sisters boyfriend used to live in Manvel and He went the other day. My dad now wants to go and see what its all about. I WANNA GO! That would be soo cool! cuz then id get to see JUSTIN!! =)

Well i think i should go now..BuHbYe!"

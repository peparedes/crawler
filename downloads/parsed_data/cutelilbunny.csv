My dad said that if I get into a good med school in Taiwan, I have to go back. Now I'm wishing my marks aren't high enough to get into the good schools, wishing I slacked off a bit more in grade 11. *wry laugh*

I'm really really really looking forward to going to University if Toronto. I have maps printed out with locations of stores, banks, bars :P, anything that seems useful written in. I have 5 different versions of my course timetable this year, in case I don't get into the courses I want, and all 4 years of my double major degree planned out. I'm really excited to be more independent; I even have recipes that I want to try out all bookmarked!

I want to have a say in where I go. Isn't it my choice? Yeah, sure, med school is like, totally hard to get in, but why cant you believe that I can get in in Canada? My Chinese is nowhere as good as the people's in Taiwan, for obvious reasons, so what makes you think I can compete with them? I get tired reading even just a paragraph of Chinese. Plus I can't even read all the words! I think it's because I'm their only hope of someone in our generation of becoming a doctor. Urgh. Talk about pressure."

"event","My Saturdays are boring. I usually just kick back, relax, and don't get anything done.

Well, I did do two things. I started studying Solubility unit for Chemistry. If I'm effective (?), maybe I'll get this unit done today. Thats what I'm hoping. And then Acid/Base unit over 2 days. Redox on Wednesday, and cram session on Thursday, and then my provincial on friday.

I'll study math. Soon. I've done too many practice provincials to want to study much. At least I know what I'm doing.

I downloaded the form for applying to university in Taiwan. Tried to fill them out but without my moms help, I totally didnt know what to fill in each blank. Can't guess the meaning from 2 words. There's so many forms. I wrote my chinese name like....5 times. Literally. AHH

Basically, I wasted a whole bunch of time today. Maybe because the second I sat down to start studying, I felt sleepy. O__O

I'm working on a scholarship essay right now, and it's really stressing me out. The submission deadline is Dec 1. Tomorrow I have to get the counselor to edit and give some input. I have to take it home, re-edit, and I'm hoping to get more input. This means that I will be submitting this essay either on the 29th or 30th. That's barely making the deadline a little bit too close for comfort.

Yeah, I was looking forward to school today. It would've made my life a lot easier to be able to see the counselor today.

Chem midterm tomorrow. I dont know how well that's going to go. I haven't studied quite enough, but I cant bring myself to focus for any longer.

Now for the happy stuff.

SNOW! SNOW! and lots of it too!!! I am such a immature kid when it comes to playing in snow. If only I have a toboggan...Yesterday's snow was perfect for snowball fights. Today's, however, was too soft and powdery and dry, which was fun when you threw it up and it floated down. Our half-assed attempt at building a snowman sure failed though. Our snowball ""fight"", if you could even call it that, was rather scary. Sandra gave up on the powdery cold stuff, and ended up chucking chunks of ice which sounded like glass shattering once they hit the pavement. Scary. Definitely."

Friday was our math test. Today was our marks being handed back. Guess what. I got 37/40. Not perfect, but I'm actually happy. I'm working really hard on math right now, trying to improve my mark. I'm happy. Really.

Tom said that he was more nervous than I was. Apparently he's scared of crying girls. And of me crying. He was sooo relieved when I was happy with my mark.

On another note, accounting is now confusing. Maybe cause all I do is chat in class. I didnt even pick up a pen today.

And chem, well, Sam is my new seat buddy. I wonder how that's going to go. He talks too much. Umm, and I need a new lab partner too. No one tell him, but I would rather not work with sam. Haha. He's a great person and all, but not the one I would choose to do labs with."

Accounting Test: well, theres a couple steps which are crazy. I talk most of the class so, basically no idea whats going on. And my work is so sloppy. Theres white-out and scribbles everywhere. Basically it looks like chicken scratches.

Chem Quiz: theres some things I dont quite understand. I -should- go in for flex BUT Kevin's playing basketball tomo. Hard decision. Maybe halfway through I'll leave.

Math Quiz: uh-oh. At least its trig. And I have faith in myself this time. If the teacher gets my mark messed up one more time, I'm gunna go tell him. Its frustrating seeing a lower mark on my test (my actual mark) than the one posted on the window."

<lj-cut text=""School"">

Two days till math test. I'm really nervous. I think Jonathon is wrecking my self-esteem. Lol. I know its bad to blame things on other people but he's had tutor so he knows how to do the questions and can do them really fast. Me, on the other hand, nope. Not a clue how to even start the question. That really bugs me. And the fact that because of this, I can't learn anything at school because there's aways an ""answer key"" right beside me.

In accounting, I got my test back, even though I handed it in last class, because the teacher made an error answering a problem I needed help with. It was pretty sweet~ I only discovered this error when Waina and I were discussing the test. Lol. And I changed an answer or two that I knew was not quite what the teacher was looking for. Anyways, who can pass up a chance to cheat? *nervous laugh* Pfft, plus its just accounting. Leona's brother and this other girl were like talking through the whole test and the teacher didn't hear them. It was kind of pathetic. Me and Sandra were waiting to ask questions and laughing at that. XD

Got our meningoccal shots today. To prevent infection of the meninges, the protective layer of fluid(?) in the brain, or something like that. It wasn't that painful. Especially amusing was how the guys would punch each other on the arm right after. Ouch. Well my arm started getting stiff, especially since I took the shot in my right arm (stupid, yeah, I know) and I some trouble writing in straight lines with nice writing. Oh well~ Tom was saying at break that he can't ""raise it up"", in Chinese of course, and Jason walked by and heard. He moved towards where another group of girls was and repeated what Tom said. And Kitty got -very- hyper. She still was on the way home. Yeah, we were arguing over how she learned the meaning of the word.

Hmm, I should take my camera around with me too. Too bad I'm too lazy to take pictures and I would rather spend lunchtime playing basketball or doing something meaningful.

Meaningful..hmm. Yeah, my whole life has become this frantic rush to accomplish something worth being proud of. It's a whole new burden on my shoulders that I just want to forget about. I'm still young, still have lots of time to achieve success, right? Right!?

-->Been busy looking at scholarships. Like Jen said, competition is crazy. I've seen ones where all the winners have either started some sort of club at school or organized a group to bring attention to something. I have nothing I really excel at, as I've kinda dabbled in assorted 

-->I have a spare this semester!! Its been really helpful in allowing me to get my homework done at school. At home, I look up university or scholarship information and review if I feel up to it. Math started becoming a challenge already, and this is the easiest chapter! Transformations and Reflections. *sigh* Well, I didn't understand. Maybe I will in the morning, after mulling it over in my sleep. Spent and hour and a half on it. I'm getting there.

-->Dance class started! I'm in competitive jazz this year, and not quite up to the standards of the other girls yet, but I feel like I'm catching on real quick. We were doing jumps, splits in the air, and then landing on one foot. I almost went over on my ankle, the left one, the weak one. It wobbled for a bit, until I put my hand down on the floor. I dont want to be a cripple. :D

-->Basketballl~~~ I missed it over summer, but now its back. The grade 12's from last year are gone, so the ones left are not as good, meaning I have more of a chance to take shots and drive in to the net. Still gotta work on those layups BUT I -did- make a shot from the 3 point line. That totally made my day.

-->Can't forget about TV. I have a new favourite show, Prison Break. Mondays @ 8. Its gory and/or suspenseful at times so I go through some episodes with my eyes covered half the time.
House. Tuesdays @ 9. This is the best best best show I've seen in a long while. Especially the last episode. The season premiere didnt live up to the hype in the commercials.
Grey's Anatomy. Thursday @ 9. Am I ever excited for this! After reading the short summaries, I can't wait. And last season's ending, with Izzie quitting the internship program, and Merideth/Derek/Finn/Addison still in that love triangle..err, square? ..I'm excited.
Desperate Housewives. Sunday @ 9. AHH I miss Paul the plumber. At least I -think- that's his name. All I remember is his hotness. Lol. And the dentist from last season was creepy. And theres definitely trouble brewing in the Solis' house. I can't wait for this show either!

-->I'm tutoring kids english. Kinda new to this still. Don't really know what fun stuff that exaberates learning I can do. Any suggestions? And anyone remember what books they read for novel study in Gr 5? Or what they were learning at grade 3? Comments would be appreciated :D

<lj-cut text=""My experience"">

When I went in, the lady looked soo confused. Apparently I look about 13. I got a lil sticker that said ""First time donor on it"". Whee~~ Then they poked my finger to see my iron/hemoglobin levels. It was soo cool watching my blood just float there. Yeah, it floated and finally sunk, unlike other peoples' which just sunk. I have low iron levels, almost didnt pass the 'test'. But the poking finger thing, that hurts. I could feel my pulse after tho, that was pretty awesome.

So I filled out the questionnaire, they took my temperature, blood pressure, heart rate. I'm at 66!! I'm assuming thats a good thing, and means I'm in shape.

Soo..I chatted with someone who was also waiting his turn. All the chairs were full. He said it was the first time he's ever seen that happen. I was so nervous, especially since I'm afraid of needles. All the nurses took it slow, and explained what they were doing. They filled tubes with my blood to send for testing in Calgary. Theres chemicals in the bags to keep the blood from coagulating, and is also why the machines swing back and forth. Since I didn't want to see the needle poking into my arm, they got a cloth and covered it :P

So since my blood comes out slow I got a lil thing to squeeze. Took about 15-20 minutes to fill the bag. Wow. After, when I was resting, all of a sudden I got really lightheaded. Almost fainted. My eyesight went blurry, breathing got laboured. Everyone rushed to my side, pressed cool clothes on my forehead, neck, and wrist. And I got orange juice. So when I felt better, and an hour after I arrived, I had a couple oreos, more glasses of juice and left.

My mom and I went to Staples, and then Wal-Mart. We were on our way to get my vision checked when I started feeling really lightheaded again. I sat down by the shoe aisle where they have seats. Then I lay down. After awhile, I threw up. Ew. They had to get the cleaning guy to come. A whole bunch of Wal-Mart employees were helping me to feel better. Gave me water and ice pack for free. Then I threw up again. Twice in a row. They had to get the cleaning guy to come AGAIN. I feel bad for that fellow. At least it was on linoleum and not carpet. Ugh... Eventually they called an ambulance to come look at me. It was an hour later that they came, since I dont constitute as an ""emergency"". Oh well. By that time I felt so much better, and after taking my BP and HB again, I got to go home. Where I threw up again. Only this time it was in a garbage can. 

So, last night I lay in bed for the longest time, finally got the energy and felt good enough to eat dinner at 10PM and then went to bed.

Today, I am mostly confined at home. There goes my Canada Day plans. At least I can walk upstairs now. Although it quickly brings my heart rate up to 120 beats/min. Thats crazy. And I lost 4 pounds. Wow. Shocking effects.

</lj-cut>


However, I am glad that I helped 3 people with my blood. I don't regret giving blood because I didnt know it would have this effect on me. Now I know. And I'll wait till I'm older to give again."

Been crazy busy doing work experience, watching the first and second season of House, studying my ass of for SAT exam next sat. Which I find rather ironic.


BUT......read the meme on <lj user=""skrknmt""> and it was so amusing that I HAD to do it. And because I've been obsessing over those gorgeous guys on tv lately. Totally fits my current ..mood thingy.

<i>List ten fictional characters you'd shag, and then tag five friends.</i>

1. Robert Chase [tv.House] I fell for his Australian accent and gorgeous hair. Lol.
2. Mike [tv.Desperate.Housewives]
3. Michael Vaughn [tv.Alias]
4. McDreamy aka Derek Shepard [tv.Grey's.Anatomy]
5. Aragorn [movie.LotR] Remember that vote in gr 8, Aragorn or Frodo? Well, I switched sides
6. Jack Sparrow [movie.PotC]
7. Gregory House [tv.House]
8. Alex Karev [tv.Grey's.Anatomy]
9. Jake Gyllenhaal [movie.Brokeback.Mountain] ..and I dont remember the character's name

"event","Well well, I think I got in trouble today out on work experience. Apparently we aren't supposed to play tag on the playground. Heh;; Didn't know that. Well the supervisor told the teacher. Blah...

Anyways, yep, this is what I do when I get out of school early to ""work"". I eat lunch with the kids, go out and have recess. Sometimes we have PE and I'm the pitcher for California Kickball. Or they do fractions and I make sure they do it correctly. Or I read them a book. Mark tests. Whatever.

Today we went to see the school play, ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Coat"". Then went out for PE. By that time it was the end of the day. Sweet~ I did nothing all day. I'm wondering, since Joseph is from the bible, are they actually allowed to put on the play? After all, you aren't supposed to promote any sort of religion at school...

I'm getting too old to be playing tag."

Before I went, I bought my really expensive shoes T-T Lemme tell you something, having small feet really sucks. The smallest the stores carry is size 6, and usually they're out of those...so either I have to get a bigger size or buy kid's shoes. Sad, isn't it? After..2 hours, I finally found a pair I like AND fits me. Wow...

Yeah, Frank came with us (me and Tom) for some reason. Huh. AND he went to Sally's. He doesnt even know her that well..

Well, we played some Pictionary at SK's. That was a lot of fun. Lots of yelling and screaming XD Our team totally owned~~~~~~ Then charades. Somehow we gave up on scores and just made funny ""skits"" up instead. 

And Josh went!! Wow..I didn't know he was coming. Totally surprised me when I saw him on the bus on my way to the mall..

We made Jack make ""girl"" faces. They were soooooo un-manly!!! xppppppppp Haha, so Tom and Kevin tried to ""aruba/happy corner"" him. But they were GOOOD pictures. Put them up Jen!!!

And we watched the guys play Kingdom Hearts II. A lot of yelling went on. Haha, can't help that the characters are hot..except Mickey Mouse's troop. Haha~~ <3 Mickey.

Oh yeah, how can I forget our sword/noodle battles~~ Haha, we even had shields!! That was funnn...

-Today is the first day since school started again that I'm done my hw before 11
-I'm sick. My eyes are swollen, nose plugged, throat sore, voice hoarse, body tired, brain dead...and whatever other ailment I've missed.
-Mock interview today. My interviewer was incredibly hard. He asked why they should hire ME. Still haven't figured that one out.
-Watched Macbeth in english class. I slept through the first 20 minutes. I'm horrible at recognizing characters. I can't tell the difference between Macbeth, Macduff, King _____, all the other guy characters. I think they look the same. Only way I can tell is by the crown the current king wears, and our teachers commentary.
-Learned quadratic formula in math. So easy. Hard to believe gr 12 math will be so much more challenging.
-My mom's back from Taiwan! That means I get a ride to school! Whee~~~ No more waking up at 7.
-I have just learned how good my dad is at chinese calligraphy. My mom brought some of his writing over. I hope she plans to frame it and put it up on the wall. Yes, its that good."

"event","I can't spell sleep right. This is sad. Its Spring Break and I'm living on 10 hours of sleep over 2 days, while 3 days ago I slept 12 hours in a day. This totally sucks. Well my mom was going back to Taiwan so we stayed up chatting till pretty late. Then I didn't want her to leave in the morning without saying goodbye, so I slept light, waking up at the sound of her alarm clock <strong>in the next room</strong>. And then..I slept over at Donna's. No need to mention it, we slept late, as per the unwritten agreement about sleepovers. Got up at 6:15 :O Donna's dad woke us up, cause I needed to get home and get ready to go to CSI Academy at BCIT. Hehe. <br /><lj-cut text=""CSI Youth Academy""><br />Hmm, today was...informative, and someone appalling. We had presenters talking about forensic science in general, and the requirements, then the surrey coroner came to talk about her role and what coroners do, which is investigate the cause of sudden unforseen death. After lunch we watched a pathologist open up a dead person's body. *I forgot what the word for that is* On video. Thank god. But right after lunch...ugh. <strong>Violent descriptions follow, highlight to read (in case some ppl dont)</strong> <font color=""#ffffff""><font colour=""white"">It was shocking, the speed in which she first sliced through the skin on the head, peeled it back over on itself like a banana so that even tho the person was face up, we could no longer see his face, and then used a saw to cut through the skull. She then took out the brain, severing all the tissues and membranes holding it to the inside of the head. Then a Y-shape was drawn down the body. Imagine a blade slicing right through skin. It was like the frog dissection we did in biology once again. Only on a larger scale, on a human, and done waaaay faster. It was frightening, the precision with which she cut away the skin and peeled it open. I remember when we did the frong dissection there was the yellow fat. Once again, the human body was like that. Clumps of fat, and you could also see muscle. It was very interesting but stomach turning. She then made two vertical incisions and opened the person ""like a book"". Ugh, I remember shuddering at that, comparing doing an autopsy (thats the word!!!) on a human to opening a book. </font>Then the person in charge turned off the video. It was really graphic, and she said the look on some people's faces weren't all that great.</font> But it was definitely an experience I wouldn't have missed. Wow. <br />Then we had more presentations. With me starting to doze off in my chair, I think we talked about prevention of injury to rescuers so incidents like with the firemen in 9/11 dont happen again. And arson. About how evidence is left, especially bugs, even after a fire, and the dead person who has been burnt still makes it through the fire somewhat intact. </lj-cut><br /><br />Random fact: Identical twins may have the same DNA but will not have the same fingerprints. <br /><br />~~~~~~ <br />When I phone, I expect someone to pick up. I want to talk. But theres no one there. In my current mood, that pisses me off. I feel a headache coming on...and excuse whatever mistakes I may have made typing this. You have no idea how many times I hit backspace.<br /><br />~~~~~~<br />I feel sorry for my brother now. I yelled at him when I got home because he didnt eat the salad I prepared him, and didnt even bother putting any of the salad or turkey back into the fridge. I get scary when I'm tired."

I handed in my resignation letter in at Pizza Hut yesterday. Yep, thats right, I'm quitting my job.

My life has been hectic, always bustling from here to there and cramming in homework in those spare moments. Well no more. I've been gradually quitting lessons to allow myself more free time, and thus, less stress. :D Yay!~~ Although I'll be sad to see my salary go. It wasnt huge amounts, but it let me have more control over my spending and finances. However, I -do- realize that I'm still a student, and shouldn't be worrying over monetary matters.

It took awhile for me to finally realize that I don't need to be working and so, in a month, I shall be free! And there also goes my independance for money.."

I know I've totally been slacking off. Especially for school. It seems like however many breaks we have isn't enough. I'm always beat and its hard to focus my attention on the teacher/hw. Well, whatever I'm working on, really. Unless its Will and Grace, which I'm totally hooked to right now...:P

Apparently I pulled my hip  muscle...on Tuesday. And it didnt start hurting till Friday night. I had to go see the doctor, and at one point it got so bad I had to go rent crutches. However, I had my mom return them before I even used them. She thought I was lying to her about needing them in the first place. Pfft, as if.

My mom and I have been getting into lots of arguments recently. I can hear myself when we argue. I sound so...whiny! I even piss myself off. Wow. I know I should try and fix it, but its going to take a lot of effort, and quite frankly, I dont feel up to it.

Yeah, I dont want to do homework."

"event","Recently, I've been having pain in what I think is the muscle by my hip. It mostly hurts after I've been running for awhile or after strenuous exercise. Well, today it started hurting like you wouldn't believe while I was at work. I ended up dragging my leg and barely waddled around. And now, I can't even get to the kitchen and back without biting my lip in pain. I just...want to get better. And soon. I need a chiropractor or something.."

Today was the Shoot-a-thon. Guess how many shots I got in. None. Out of ten. Oh yippie...argh, I can't believe it. I got 9 for 11 before the shootout. And yes, boys balls are SOO much better. All the shots i took were lined up with the basket, only they didnt go far enough. Stupid things...Anyways, Mr. McMurchie's kid, Devan, got 7/10, won the shootout, AND he can shoot from the three point line. What a guy..."

"event","I'm going to try and update everyday, if possible, for as long as this streak is going to last. Last entry I made was private, December 20th, and for friends, August 30th. Wow, its been awhile. But now, now I hope to be able to recall some of my fonder, and some not so fond memories.

Second semester has started and my courses are starting to kick me in the ass. As usual, I've been slacking off, not wanting to do my homework, but not, its really starting to pile up. And yeah, I've forgotten how much I -really- hate socials and english.

As far as I've observed, Mr. Mahli isn't as frustrating, for lack of a better word, as people say he is. Fair enough, there's a good deal of homework, and I guess I can handle. As long his tests aren't a pain in the rear end, and he doesn't keep going off on his own little tangent in the middle of lectures, I'm fine. Really. Plus, I get extra time during portfolio since I'm almost done the stinkin' thing. And if I end up having to suffer through this class, Sally's coming down with me! MUAHAHA

I hate english class, I really do. The only thing keeping me alive is annie, sitting across the room. We have our little mute conversations throughout class...and confuse JT along the way. Apparently, he keeps thinking we're talking to him. You wish!~ Ha....nah, I'm not that mean. I think I love my spot. Think because I'm not sure yet. I sit in the corner by the teachers computer. JT, in front of me block the teacher's view of me when she's up talking at the front. Thus, I can sleep! :D

Math. y=mx+b. Ahh, those things. Graphs. Fun? Not at all. Mr. Huzyk livens things up in class, but quite frankly, his stories dont have much to do with math and I'd rather be doing homework I'd later be doing at home if the work wasnt so easy to the point that I skip half the questions.

[RANDOM] Tom tried to give me a banana for Valentine's Day. I'm not kidding. Wow..what a guy. He insists the banana will revolutionize V-Day and in the future generations, we'll all be giving banana's to our loved ones........

Anyways, thats really all I wanted to say. Needed somewhere to get it all out...:D"

"event","Yep...6. I guess I should start packing now...meh. I should also study SS and study theory, but screw those things. I'll manage. [Note to self: Find a piano to practice on in taiwan] Lalalaz, happy happy day...cept for a lot of things. But at least I'm in a good mood. A little disappointed with my marks (which is why I should go work} but I'll pull it back up. Always do, especially in second semester. Hmm, french. Last week of french student teacher, whose name i cant spell so thats what shes referred to as. And SS..ugh. If there weren't so many worksheets and projects. Planning is livable. For now at least. English, I'm so proud of myself for working ahead. ^^ Mmm, my life in a nutshell..."

"event","Wow, now I know what cheekbones are for. Heh. Yeah, I was so so so smart today and climbed up on the basketball hoop thinger. And..accidently knocked it down. And I knew I was falling too...kinda eased my tumble that way. Well, it still landed on mi..owie. Haha, I think Tom saved me a little...whew~ Didn't poke my eye out which was amazing, but now I got a bump on my head and my cheek feels a lil raw. I've been through worse, so I'll live...it was the black cat I saw yesterday, I swear to god it was... 

Anyways, finished SS project. Now just one worksheet, and some english, and maybe the planning sheet if i feel like picking it up again. Yay~ almost done. And none of it's due monday! Ugh, SS Unit 2 test Tuesday...early dismissal Monday!

"event","Argh, soo many projects due for Monday. French, SS, Planning, and Eng hw. If I dont die by the end of today, cause i have to finish today, I dont know what'll happen. Maybe I'll do an overview of my classes: 


French 

This is an ok class..I hate the student teacher, Tom is sitting behind me, and I get what I'm doing. Its pretty good...plus I can get away with a lot of goofing off 
We have ""in class"" poster project due Monday. Thank god we have some time to finish and put it all together on Monday. My group right now is Tyrone, Kristen, JT, and me. Lalala, doing some stalking...:D Just gotta draw and cut out the olympic rings, then we're good to go. 

TEACHER: B- | CLASSMATES: A | CURRICULUM: B+ | COMPETITION: EXTREMELY HIGH | AMOUNT OF HW: low | ATMOSPHERE: A- | OVERALL: A- 


Social Studies 

Hm, fun, cept for the crazy corner. If they weren't there, it'd be soo much quieter, and Rachel Unger. SS isnt my fav subject, which is why I've decided to give up on going into Law, I find it boring and useless to my future... 
Newspaper project due Monday also. I dont know how he expects us to finish so soon. This is hard..well, besides the goofing off. Still got the words to write in pen, and draw a few pics then we're done! 

TEACHER: A- | CLASSMATES: A | CURRICULUM: B | COMPETITION: MODERATE TO HIGH | AMOUNT OF HW: moderate | ATMOSPHERE: A- | OVERALL: A 


Planning 

Yep, the class I have with David..he bugs me all class, but I have a lot of fun talking to Jeff Bale, Corey Willis, and Peter. All people I didnt know too well/wasn't too close to. ^^ This is such a fun class to be in, especially with Mr. Nguyn..tho our class seems to have split into girls and guys. And i'm in the wrong side. 
I have a 2 page project/essay on the profession of my choice due for Tuesday, but I need to be done by Monday. I plan to be an optometrist, so good luck to me on that. I think a lot of the information can be found on Career Crusing though, so this shouldn't take TOO too long. 

TEACHER: A | CLASSMATES: A- | CURRICULUM: A | COMPETITION: EXTREMELY LOW | AMOUNT OF HW: moderate to low | ATMOSPHERE: A | OVERALL: A 


English 

Ah~ the ""dummy"" class, except for Lily and Andy, and well, Scott, but he rarely talks at all. Everyone else is stupid, but funny. Except for Steven Rhode and Sasha. They sit behind me and talk ALL class. And they cant seem to talk quietly. Silent time is students and the teacher throwing insults at each other, making it so that its impossible to concentrate on writing. THe ""loony toons gallery"" makes things soo funny, but impossible to learn. 
We're reading the Chrysalids. Ch 4 work is due for Monday. I want to see if I can finish up to Ch 6, and read the whole book by then. 

TEACHER: A | CLASSMATES: B | CURRICULUM: A+ | COMPETITION: MODERATE TO LOW | AMOUNT OF HW: high | ATMOSPHERE: B+ | OVERALL: A- 

~~~~~~~~~~~~

AHA, i copied SK's thinger!!! Mmm, yeah..i dont particularly like any of my classes...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPAMMM!!!~ Lol, we seem to have reached 31 and 28 comments, respectively. Wtf does that mean...lolz.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oh yeah, SK's house on Friday the 11th..the gang. Yep~ I'm so proud of my organizational skills...and you better ask your mom soon girl~"

"event","OMG, you have no idea how much i hate my stinking courses this semester. Everyone is so loud and noisy and not concentrating! AHH. Seriously, it bugs me so much. I cant seem to get any work done. -sigh- The counsellor managed to get all the courses I wanted in the correct blocks without any help...and then he found out Planning, C block had 34 kids. Didnt want to put me in [AHH] so I guess I'm stuck. That is, until, <b>IF</b> someone changes their schedule OUT of there. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
<br><br><br>
Stinking Donna wouldnt let me walk home. So easily bribed, oh man, with just a lil bit of food. Haha, I told her to turn around, the moon's so bright today. And she turned around and I was like, it's behind the trees. = = Hehe, oops. Well it WAS pretty, we saw it while walking back to the school, and Donna was like, ""Aw, this is so romantic, and JENNY is with ME and not TOM."" Haha, boy, someone was happy.

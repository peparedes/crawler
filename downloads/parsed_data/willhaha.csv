Its become my favorite time of day, and Ive almost got this feeling of fall permeating through my system. THe mix of air conditioning and the blank tree limbs=Fall to me. I miss fall so badly and the closest thing to a real fall was while I was working in Santa Barbara last year. The only problem was that I was working so hard and that on my only day off I was wasting my time driving to la and not enjoying the beauty around me. When the leaves fell at the vineyard it was because we were ripping the vines of their fruit. When the fruit is all off there are rows upon rows of lifeless stocks. Harvest is happening right now and I cant believe I'm sitting at a desk. It's truly the most rewarding thing I've ever done. 
I love my job now but its just so different, which is fine. 
I'm kind of getting sick a sore throat and such, but plan on having a relaxing weekend in La Jolla, Sunday brunch a trip to the museum plenty of time to relax. That's one thing I do so well now, is relaxing on my days off."

May 5th at 310 N Crescent Dr. Beverly Hills, Apartment # 106 from 6pm to 8pm

 

William Hathaway, in association with Tyler March, is pleased to present the inaugural exhibition from their apartment in Beverly Hills. The show contains works from five LA artists, featuring art made specifically for the exhibition. The focal point of the show will be an installation by William Hathaway: a shopping-carts construction called ""Shop This!"": stacked shopping carts that began to amalgamate when William realized how much room he had in his new apartment, so much so that he could store ten shopping carts without skipping a beat. Each shopping cart has been borrowed from the streets of Beverly Hills. On walks home from Whole Foods or Rite Aid, Tyler and William would come across shopping carts scattered about their affluent neighborhood. How or why were these carts so far from home? The act of hoarding these useless/useful objects began to take on artistic connotations, and the duo invited others to participate in a first curatorial endeavor in their apartment with too much room."

The supplement dosage in the Bonn study is considered high - the recommended daily intake for vitamin D is 400 IU for people over 50, and 600 IU for people over 70, according to the National Institutes of Health. But alternative health care practitioners generally recommend higher levels.

In the e-Alert ""Sunny Side of the Street"" (12/22/03), I told you about Dr. Jonathan Wright's recommendations for vitamin D intake: Between 1600 and 2000 IUs daily, and as much as 4000 IUs for those over 40. According to Dr. Wright, it's impossible for most people to get enough vitamin D from the sun alone, and he discourages the use of dairy products because of the many other health concerns they raise. Instead, he suggests other food sources like salmon and sardines, or cod liver oil, which provides more than 1300 IUs of vitamin D per tablespoon.

In the February 2002 issue of Nutrition and Healing newsletter, Dr. Wright says, ""It's very likely that if you're over 40 and supplement your diet with a generous amount of vitamin D, you can lower your risk of prostate, breast, and bowel cancer, along with your risk of 'essential' hypertension, osteoporosis, and tuberculosis."""

Omega-3 played a big role in healing coal miner's brain
--------------------

By Jamie Talan
Tribune Newspapers: Newsday

May 2, 2006

In the days after the Jan. 2 Sago Mine explosion disaster, the only survivor, Randal McCloy Jr., was experiencing multiple organ failure and severe brain damage.

Dr. Julian Bailes, McCloy's neurosurgeon at the West Virginia University School of Medicine and head of the trauma center, was up to speed on the latest benefits of the ""miracle molecule"" omega-3 fatty acids when he phoned Barry Sears of Zone Diet fame to ask about a recommended dose for the very ill miner.

""I've read everything Sears has written,"" Bailes said. ""And he convinced me that DHA could play a role in Mr. McCloy's recovery. He sent me his product, which was the main source in his [McCloy's] treatments.""

Omega-3 is an essential amino acid that is in short supply in American diets, and its use has catapulted up the charts of popular nutrient supplements. And seemingly for good reason. It has so many jobs in the human body that cardiologists, neurologists, psychiatrists and now trauma surgeons are using these naturally safe amino acids to prevent and treat a wide variety of medical problems.

Sears, who has studied omega-3 fatty acids and now manufacturers his own pharmaceutical-grade product, suggested that Bailes administer a total of 18 grams of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the two most important omega-3 fatty acids, via feeding tube. McCloy remained on the supplement until his return home March 30.

This was an extraordinarily high dose, Sears explained, but staff monitored McCloy's blood levels to assure it remained within a certain therapeutic range. The EPA reduced the inflammation caused by the lack of oxygen within the brain, and the DHA was required to repair the damage, Sears said. ""I certainly think it played a big role,"" in his recovery, Bailes said. ""How can he rebuild his brain if he doesn't have the substrate to do it?""

After being in a coma for weeks and in rehab for months, the miner is stiff and thin but walking on his own and exercising his right arm.

Besides helping heal the brain, omega-3, which is probably one of the most studied natural supplements, has passed muster in helping heal the heart, pancreas, immune system and joints. Potent anti-inflammatories, omega-3 fish oil supplements contain the same fatty acids -- DHA and EPA -- found in fish. Scientists say the American diet is so depleted of these fatty acids that supplements are not just useful but necessary.

A recent analysis of several large studies published in the British Medical Journal said the amino acids didn't possess the benefits touted in the medical literature. But many experts say that analysis failed to cover the wide range of scientific findings. Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that one large British study with a ""suboptimal design wiped out the benefits from all the other studies."" He said many studies have confirmed omega-3 supplements reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death and protect against cardiovascular diseases.

""This has more evidence-based science than any other supplement,"" said Dr. Steven Lamm, an internist at New York University School of Medicine

Dr. David Perlmutter of Naples, Fla., said that DHA enhances a brain-derived growth factor and could explain why expectant mothers who take omega-3 supplements have children who score higher on intelligence tests."

It would make it all seem worth it, the trip to New York in december, the meetings, the four years of college I spent learning art history. The Museums trip to Paris when I was nine,ten years old, my mother dragging me through a Henry Matisse exhibit the same year my father died. Its funny how then I wanted to rip her eyes out and go to the children's museum in Boston but now I look back and see how important it was for me in my growth as a human. Ive started to see how each person has effected my life whether its positive or negative. What's interesting to me as well is how its always really been the women in my life that have been the biggest influences on me, from my mother to my sister Anna, Kealy and Karen, carol-grahams mother, from my first kiss, right up to my first love Genevieve. Maybe that's the cause of loosing my father at such a young age. Could I just trust women more then men? Most of the influential men in my life have been gay, as my mother didn't really have straight friends, they were the ones besides my uncles that showed me the most with love and guidence. Anyway Im loving my work and cant believe that its all happening so fast."

I have to be at work at nine thirty which is not too early and I get to leave at five thirty which is not too late. I love working here and Im going to learn so much about the art world. I also live with in walking distance to work so I got that going for me, which is nice. The only problem is I dont have any friends besides my wonderful roommate Tyler. This is photo of the two of us with my sister and her friend/roommate Katherine.

As for myself personally and socially, its very quiet. Im not quite ready to grab a hold of Los Angeles or new people just yet. Im focused on work yet its getting kind of lonely. I feel like ive moved to a new city yet Ive lived here four years. Whittier really is quite a bubble, or it was for me. What's more difficult and im not sure if others have this problem because most people I know here are from around California is that my friends from back east have not been out to visit. It kind of hurts my feelings, because they expect to see me when I come home for the summers or on vacations. 
Ive been reading more and spending at least two hours reading on my days off. Im in the middle of Lullaby, by Chuck Palahniuk. I didnt like Flight club, the movie and I was wondering if anyone has read the book and whether or not it was any good. Or Choke for that matter. Ive also been reading essays in the beginning of the art catalogues and one in particular was a show that Steve Martin did on his own art collection. It was more or less a story of his found love for art and how his collection had shaped up over the years. He write a lot of short stories and plays right? 
Well Ive been away from my work too long. 
Here is a photo of my most recent work, its an instilation called ""too much room""

Anyway I have been really excited lately about my job and my life beginning for real. I cant believe I could be here for two years, or for however many years I stay. My apt is coming along nicely as Tyler and I have put a bunch of stuff in it. My room still has a twin bed which will not be quite big enough for me and another person. Genevieve will love it because its the ultimate cuddling bed. 
One big problem with my apt is that we don't have a refrigerator yet so I'm spending way too much money on food and not cooking my own. Its really killing me because there are so many things I want to make in my new kitchen(with a gas stove!!!!) 
Ive met some new people through Tyler who are very nice and kind of interesting, so it will be comforting and fun to have new people around. 
We kind of have a dog too, Marbles who is probably the best dog ever. Hes so young and fucking cute it kills us to have to give him away. He is going to grow too big for our modest apartment and we would never have enough time to let him out and run free. So sad.

You know that ideal love that each of us dreams of from childhood? That's you!
Not because you posess all of the ideal characteristics, but because you are a savvy shape shifter.
You have the uncanny ability to detect someone's particular fantasy... and make it you.

You inspire each person to be an idealist and passionate, and you make each moment memorable
Even a simple coffee date with you can be the most romantic moment of someone's life
By giving your date exactly what he or she desires, you quickly become the ideal lover.

Your abilities to make dreams come true is so strong, that you are often the love of many people's lives.
Your ex's (and even people you have simply met or been friends with) long to be yours.
No doubt you are the one others have dreamed of... your biggest challenge is finding *your* dream lover.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

IT was about 11 when we left with the assumption that brad was going to buy a hotel in the city for us to ssleep in. On first glance there were no hotels with any rooms so we found a parking spot on the street pretty close to were we wanted to go. some bar im not sure where maybe the marina district, anyway i perceded to drink heavily, like really drink something ive not really done in a while. Its just not as fun to go out when your not single because the whole time I just wanted to sneak away with Genevievemonster. The worst part of the story is that we came home, its also the best part of the story. Thats because we made it into beds. 
Before sleep, brad george and I ganged up and took out collen(thats the way I spell his name/its a joke)He tried to fight back but was not able I think because he had been sleeping while the three of us were stuffing our faces with everything from Curried beef which didn thave beef in it because I picked it all out before dinner, to rice crispy treats, Gawd those things are so terrible but so good. 
Now we are still mildly drunk, and taking showers getting ready to I guess drink and eat before we go to a football game, usc vs cal. Last night was wonderful in many way, although it seems weird being out of college and partying with all my friends still in college. Am I just a snob?

School is over, and Ive never been so excited to go back. The only way I can do it though would be if my grandfather would pay, im not trying to have any debt. That must sound snobby but its the best gift ive ever received, school has never cost me a thing. Geneveive and I got into a bit of an arguement about school, and I dont really care to fill this journal in to what it was about, only that it made me think a bit more about what I didnt do the last four years. For me, boarding school was the most challenging years of my life. College not as useful the entire time. That pissed her off, she hates dumb people. Im right on the edge in her minds eyes. 
During work I do a lot of things that dont require a lot of thinking. Day dreaming has become an amazing time pleaser. For hours I have to sift through grapes as we process 24 bins of syrah each day. Many times Im the one dumping from atop the forklift, either way my focus is on what i wish I could do for the next year. 
Most of the time Im traveling somewhere, or moving somewhere with Geneveive. its gross but most of them have genevieve in them. But, there were a couple today where I moved to Sanfran with my sister, and lived in her old house on Filmore and Bush in lower pacific heights. Sabah would probably know this, but im reminding myself of the great movie TRIPPIN. 
I need a change, im not sure with what, but the winery has slowed down to a point were I need to do something else. Im getting nervous just thinking about moving to Nuevo York, why cant I just find a great place in LA that comes with a job that pays me enough and gives me health insurence. It all brings me back to this fucking lawsuit. Gawd i hate chicago."

The day she left was also the day a large group of my friends from all over the country converged on MDI for a weekend of partying. More like one night but an epic night it was. We all realized that after graduating college beer pong is not as much fun, unless there are underage girls playing. our game lasted thirty minutes untill the teams wondered off. The highlight of the three weeks in maine, was one the rediculous time I spent with my cousin in Newyork, going north with genevieve to my camp as we call it in maine, (lakehouse in every other part of the world) Sailing with nick and the team, and a fabulous night drinking margaritas with nick at xyz. 140 dollars later we were almost ready to drive home. 
Now Im back in Santa Barbara, with a fucking huge crew of family living in this five bed room house. In two rooms there are up to three people, im reduced to sleeping in the dining room, which suits me just fine, seeing ive found out its the quietest room in the house.

"event","So its my second day in a row of work, that is at the Santa Barbara winery. Its going well, today we bottled almost 3000 cases of wine. This the head wine maker said was the most ever bottled in one day. This can only mean one thing, i am getting stronger, I can actually feel myself growing. Soon I will be too strong for my own good, and finally ill be able to man handle Genevieve. Im not sure if you all know but she is stronger than me, or so she has told me. The house is still amazing(santa barbara house) the light in the morning is none existant as there is much fog, but in the late afternoon there is the most incredible light reflecting off the mountians. I wish I had learned how to paint while becoming an art major. I was too busy trying to smoke drink and fuck."

The photos were taken by me, from out our apartment building on LSD overlooking of Belmont harbor Chicago IL. Each photo was taken in a different season, however you cant really tell, because Ive whitewashed them a bit. Keely felt pretty strongly about the painting and wants it for our lake house in maine, so off it goes to maine.

"event","I followed lucy, our dog into keely's bed room. Just before karen asked me if I could attempt to find out what kind of rodent was under keelys cabinet. The cats and the dog were keeping it in the corners so it was difficult to see what it was. At first I thought a possum, yet futher details showed that it had little teeth in the front of its snout. A FUCKING RAT, karen wanted me to reach in there and pull out a rat. Fuck that I told them. Then feeling like I had to be some sort of help, I threw on some leather gloves and reached down into the corner. The little rat jumped over my hand and moved to the other corner. Fuck this little rat. I reached down again with force and grabbed that little monster. Gawd it was pretty gross. I dropped it into the bag Karen was holding just in time, it was getting loose and looked as though it was going to sink its little teeth into my wrist. 
Now im telling the story, thinking about how much of a wimp I am, ahhh it was so gross. So sure everyone has used a broom or shew a rat away, many have even cleaned up a dead rat or mouse that a pet has killed, but not many have had to grab one out of hiding.

"event","Tonight has been very interesting, as I wait for Genevieve to call me Ive been reading some live journal stuff. Off in the distance I heard a cry for help. The name was William, william, but I was so caught up in the journals I didnt respond as quickly as I should have. My sister, Kealy is paralyzed pretty much from the neck down although she has use of her arms and a couple fingers. Shes an amazing person for all of those who have met her they instantly fall in love. As well as my sister karen. Either way the cries were from Kealy who as I approached her room could see had not made it from her chair to the bed, and had fallen awkwardly with her face and chest on the bed while her legs limp and motionless on the floor. Her body of couse has gone through a great deal of entropy having been in the chair over twenty years. They never thought she would live past ten years. After picking her up and placing her on the bed, comforted her while she cried for her helplessness. 
Upon realizing her shoes and pants where still on, I knew that it was going to be my job to help her this evening, this is something very new to me. I took off her shoes and and watched as she fumbled with her top button. A knot formed in my stomach as I knew I was going to have to take my sisters pants off. My whole life she has worn jeans, even as her brother Ive never seen her legs. It was just a couple years before I was born that she stopped going into the pool. It was difficult and made me realize that even though I dont have a job and Im broke and all these things are difficult in my life none compare to my sisters problems.

So I met with this woman working on the case who probably only has to wear one goggle when she goes swimming in her pool. Then it was off to the bank, it was so fucking hot that I almost cut holes in my polos to let the sweat drain... thank genevieve for the idea. Went to the bank transfered money then somehow found myself at the location where I almost lost my life. It was so fucking high, I cant believe I lived. Then I met my mother and and went to get food for our sail, on the way I dropped off some film and convinced the propriator to sell me a fisheye lens for really cheep, he might have been gay, because he gave it to me. As you will notice i was wearing whale shorts so that might of had some pull. Then it was off to the boat, and with the sun beaming the wind looked as though it was picking up. Without a grip of wind its not much fun. After getting out of the harbor there were a lot of big waves but no wind, about an hour into our motering the wind picked up to about 13 knots and we started crusing at six or seven knots which is pretty good for our boat. There were many photo ops and Anna and I might send some to Patagonia and J-crew, what do you think....
The sun went down and the full moon rose from out of the lake, unfortunitly I was without my honey and had to watch my mother with jon, and my sister clutching her boy. Gawd Genevieve where are you.

As if I was just heading to Vegas or something. IT wasnt untill I got into the back of the truck(yes the cab of a toyota tundra) that I kind of realized that it was going to be a long drive. At about vegas I realized that Salt Lake was 500 miles away, and boulder was another 500 from there. Kill me dead. The back windows were broken out of the truck so the wind was whiping in making ice on my face.(freezing up my tears) I luckly found some duct tape and went to work. Ive got mad photos that I will throw on when I get them on my photobucket. Anyway it was a long drive. Once we got there I took a shower and went out to see some old friends. Went to bed friday night at 4, woke up at ten, thursday night we partied all night so I had only one hour of sleep, so after three days ive had seven hours of sleep. After a great day in boulder I get a nap for three hours. Up to 10hrs of sleep. THen ollie Graham and I partied with some of Ollies sisters friends, and we partied late, untill 5. I went to bed for a little nap, woke up at ten. THen jumped back in a fucking car and drove to LA. So from wednesday to sunday I had 15 hours of sleep and 2000 miles of driving. After passing Vegas my friend Kristian who I drove back with decided that he wanted some food, so we stopped. I drove about an hour and a half when I started to see things. I had my goggles on because the lights were too bright. I was also ripping Black and Milds. What are great weekend.

As for everything else Im worried, in a month Im walking past the president of this college, picking up a diploma I worked so fucking hard to get. Thats a lie, I didnt work that hard but school for now is over. I wish there was something in my life a little more stable than oh wait than nothing. Not even that little monster that I like so much is stable. Thanks to me, ive not been preparing myself for graduating. I never thought it would take me more than four years, but I also dont think its actually happening. For all of those who are not there, dont believe it.

She is also nice enough not to delete the ones that are really awesome. I came back from Bermuda today and started writing a paper due tusday, that would be today. Anti up, is what i heard at four this morning when my roommate got back, so im up still, with four pages of worthless shit. Im going to blame it on art and being an art major, we dont write papers, we write lame explanations paintings, using first person and lame quote by arrogant artist. Rushdie kicked my ass, and after reading half the book, im writing a paper on it. Bad idea. Good story, 
Im walking after my cousin who was just called a faggot, and pulling him into a bar with three other cousins two of which played semi pro and pro hockey, each didnt her the remark. Toby leaves the bar to go ""fight"" the homophobics. One of my hockey cousins fallows after a half hour we meet up on the street. ""Way too many big black man at that bar, who knows what I had in mind, i just wanted to ask him why he had to call me a faggot, there was no need of it."" Toby confused and kind of hurt by the remark. 
I ask to use the phone, at this point ive had maybe 100 dark and stormies the official drink of Bermuda. We all get a change to talk to genevieve on the phone, in where they embarrass me and themselves. I get the phone back and after two minutes I realize that my cousins are no where in sight. To end this boring story, they left me in Hamilton with a thirty minute cab ride costing 28 dollars to get back to the hotel. I had figured they would find me so I plopped myself in the closest bar to consume just ""one more drink."" 
THis is my cousin the next morning who by the way thew up. I however went to breakfast lunch and dinner. I cant lie though I slept between all of the meals, waisting a whole day in bermuda.

"event","Today was a great day, besides a near mental break down and failing to get valentines presents I did however see Sabah destroy Misha Barton's life. This poor thing must have been 90 pounds, and sabah with her man like strength tried to barge through the door right after Misha was already half way through. Sabah figured that there are two doors for a reason, one for entering and one as an exit. Unfortunately this girls luggage was stuck because the door she was walking through was closing behind her and while sabah opened the other door it was jamming up the luggage. We were all at a stand still, sabahs door was not opening because the luggage was in the way. She continued to push forward, when sabah makes her mind up theres no turning back. After a little push to Misha's door we were able to all get through. It wasnt even that cool to see her, what was great, was seeing sabah smashing her luggage between two door. Im not sure if this all makes sense, I probably should have just told you we saw this chick and sabah knocked her out. 
Oh the Vag monologues suck, however the singing and dancing was the highlight."

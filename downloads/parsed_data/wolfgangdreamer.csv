You like apples, how's them apples? I knew that I was a major bad ass from the start. This just proves it all. So I'm home and bummed to hear that the Batman Begins teaser isn't released yet...mother fuckers. It hurts a bit. Also, there's a major fire going on about 3 or four miles outside my house, you've probably seen it on TV. 

Don't ya just love the city? There's crazy shit going on everywhere.

Countdown to Brandon...8 days, 4 hours, 2 minutes. I might want to clean my apartment. off to do that I guess.

I'm out."

"event","Well I just signed up for a new website tonight. Myspace.com, I was forced to by my friend Coby. He said that I would meet many an easy chick on this website that live within the area of Santa Clarita. Now that is not the reason that I signed up for it, but truthfully, I would not mind getting laid soon. I mean I haven't even slep with someone from down here since I moved, sadness. I deal though. 

As for other things, the countdown still continues till Cody, Brandon, and Mike get here. 13 DAYS!!!!!!!! I can't wait till my brother pisses himself while riding on ""X"". Scariest fucking ride ever!

Speaking of Brandon, that boy has quite the obsession with filling out stupid ass surveys. I mean how many times can you answer the same damn questions over and over. And to add injury to insult, he doesn't even answer them with the right answers. That's right Brandon, you don't answer all the questions honestly. Caught ya bitch.

Anyway, I be tired now. Its 2:13 in the A.M. And I have a long day of lounging on my ass all day tomorrow. AHHHHHH, how I love days off."

"event","So yes, here it is Saturday afternoon. I have work at 3:15, so I'm just biding my time until then. I'm also biding my time until my new roommate moves in and my brother visits me. Its been very boring just having this whole apartment to myself.

GODDAMN! 
Anyway, all my people begin to show up on the 25th. I have some great plans for what we are going to do too. The 27th & 28th will be very exciting, expensive but exciting. The first day we will be going to Six Flags:Magic Mountain. B will finally grow into a man and ride a real roller coaster. Then on the 28th we're off to Disneyland, the happiest place on Earth. Here I am going to get Goofy or if I'm lucky, Mickey, to fondle Brandon's friend Mike. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! You can never suspect the Disney characters. 
<img src=""http://www.thecollectionshop.com/images/products/1271cmedium.jpg"">
There is full proof evidence that Goofy wants to molest my brother and his friends. Look at the creeping posture (sp?). He is heading in for the kill.

Enough with my conspiracy theory. The end of this month should be much fun. I've even gotten the time off of work for these excting events. Anyway, its time to shower and get ready to make more coffee. Again, I must make note of how odd a place like Starbucks is. You're making coffee for people who can't deal without it, sad yes, but still plenty of opportunities for hilarity.

Isn't there an irony that I work at Starbuck's, and yet I do not drink coffee. I thought it was funny. What ever I am tired.

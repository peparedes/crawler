This makes graduation a million times easier. 180 more days, give or take. Three months and six days until I'm an honest-to-goodness, all-the-trimmings-but-liquor adult.
It's interesting that you can go to war and die before they let you drink.

(Shocking, I know.)
It may just be A Thought, or it good be A Really Good Idea.
Here goes:

Presents are one of the best things in life. I'm too broke for real presents and have such bad handwriting that the post office would probably give up and burn anything I tried to send.
So I thought I could give everyone photo-presents.
Confused? Me too. Let me explain:
Is there anything you've ever wanted to see a picture of but haven't? Now's your chance! I'm off to New York tomorrow, the city of cityness. If something exists, it's probably there.
So if you've ever wanted to see...
<ul type=""circle"">
<li>A flying cat on a subway</li>
<li>Someone imitating a cartoon character</li>
<li>Me holding up a sign with your name, ""I need a hug"", ""3l\/35 4R3 L337"" or something.</li>
</ul>
...then it's your lucky day, punk.

P.S.: Nothing <i>too</i> illegal or impossible. So ""someone doing a line off a hooker"" wouldn't work, because my mum would kill me if she saw the picture. So no dice with ""a dragon eating a small dog"" or ""crazed hobbit orgies"" either.
But if you happen to see that last one let me know."

<i>Then I look up, sun-glare in my eyes,
Are you having regrets about last night?</i>
Maybe I'm a little too young to be feeling so old about this. But if I minced words and didn't talk about it, I'd still feel it. And hey, why have an on-line journal if not to let your deep dark secrets crawl around a little?
It's a little soon after Papa passed away to be back to normal...
... But yeah, I'm close. If there's one thing this whole grief process is, it's slow and deliberate and relentless.
All that aside, I want to grow up just a little. I can't play Peter Pan forever.
I kindasorta would like to be in love.
<i>you say the word, you know I will find you,
or if you need some time I don't mind</i>
I've never dared to hope for a bed of roses. God knows, if everyone met their soul-mate in High School... Can you get tired of your true love? Can you hate your cosmic twin's snoring? And if not, wouldn't it burn all the fire out of you, having to feel so much so young?
Maybe it's better to be like I am. I've never dated, never been kissed, really. And maybe it'll stay like that.
Ballerinas and strange girls are hard to love, I've heard.
<i>We may fall and stumble upon a carousel,
Heaven knows where it would take us</i>
Worse yet. In a hypothetical question and a conundrum, would it be prince or princess charming?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
<i>I'm not like the girls that you've known,
but I believe I'm worth coming home to</i>
If I were going to throw sense and caution into the wind, maybe I'd try.
I'd hold hands in the hallways, spin through city lanes under streetlights. Maybe we'd run through the forests and skin our knees and laugh like the children we almost were. Maybe we'd braid flowers and etch our names in tree bark.
Or maybe we'd hold on so close so spinning fast we'd fall down. Maybe we'd be together and attached at the hip and finish each other's sentences.
Or maybe we would dance, arabesques and lifts and I would never have to dance the <i>pas de deux</i>s by myself.
Maybe we would stay far apart, afraid of breaking everything and never so much as breathing when we were close.
<i>This girl only sleeps with butterflies</i>
Or maybe not.
I like that answer best.
Great romances and heart-stopping loves are fine for most people.
But I don't think I'm cut out for it."

According to my dream, when mortals go into the West they fade on earth.
When hobbits go west, a figment and a thought of them appears in the Library under the Mountain.
(I know that sounds weird. Bear with me.)
When Frodo left he told Sam and I that he could come back, one day, if there was no more death in the world.
And so Sam and I looked for some-odd decades to find a way to end death.
Sam grew old and wearied at looking for the impossible.
Sam passed into the west.
I ran to the old bookstore, knocked three times, opened the back door behind the counter, and there was Frodo.
""Oh, Frodo, Sam can't help me look anymore..."" I said.
""What do you mean? He's right here."" Frodo smiled.
Sam came out from behind a bookshelf, not an elderly hobbit anymore, but the young one who set out from the Shire to go to Mordor.
""Can you ever come back?"" I asked.
""Only when there's no more death."" They said.
""But you can always come and visit us, miss."" Sam said.
I left, and I searched for the cure for death for years. Eighty-something years later I found it in a department store.
I ran back to the bookstore where the door to the Library was hidden.
The bookstore had been destroyed. 
The door was gone."

I do not mention that the love of Hesse's love was a he. That's none of my damn business. But if he'd realized that sooner, maybe M'sieur Hesse would have written women as something more than pillars of motherhood.

Do I sound like your grandmother?
Sorry.
I'll just nip off and go fnarking. And hang-gliding. And jay-walking, just for good measure.
That doesn't sound like your grandmother too, does it?
Good lord.
Your family really is weirder than mine.

(P.S.: Fnarking is not f'cking. Extract your mind from the gutter.)
(P.P.S.: Fnarking is when you drive up to the aviary in the St. Louis Zoo with a bunch of friends (preferably drunk), honk the horn and go ""FNARK!"" And the birds make Noise. Fnark is the magic word. Not that I would ever do that, it's cruelty to animals. I have, however, done that in a suburb...)"

Stabbed in eye with mascara pencil.
And when I ask if they could aim for the iris rather than the pupil, they accuse me of being a diva.
I hate being a struggling actress.
Thus, am sending out a telegram to Providence.

Dear Benevolent Forces,
Will the merciful heavens please, oh please, send a nice director with a movie in tow maybe? This is perhaps a lot to ask. Any help at all would be appreciated.

Thank you very much.

""National Marriage Week.""
The leader of our country describes ""The Sanctity of Marriage"" as ""the union between one man and one woman.""
Burn that page from your dictionaries, lovelies.
Marriage is henseforth the union of any number of people who love and are committed and devoted to each other.

Once upon a time marriage was for the safety of children. But times have changed, and the conservatives are sitting in the dark with a metaphorical burned-out lightbulb because there's no need to change anything.
And the conservatives are locking the windows 'cause winds of change are blowing in from the North. In Canada gay marriage is already legal.
But if you bolt the windows you can't see the sunrise of new horizons.

""Marriage is for families.""
And love, only love, makes a family."

And all your crazy colors paint you
Delightfully insane
Bubblegum snaps at cars that pass
Guess it's their loss they never saw you
In rear-view glass
And no lip-gloss girl wants to ride
'Cause your car was new in '69
It's funhouse loud inside
Funny how your dark-glass hair blends
With the streaks of night outside
And we stay best friends

You're not of this world-

Singing your favorite old Coltrane
To me and all the stars

Dad went absolutely bonkers.
Not mild peanut-butter and bologna sandwich bonkers. Paint the cat's arse green bonkers. I am not even kidding.
Cat: *knocks milk over*
Dad: We need to do something about that cat.
Me: We already got her girly bits chopped off.
Cat: *proceeds to wipe butt in milk*
Dad: I think we need to paint her butt green. 
Dad tried to catch the cat, a rather dim idea.
Meanwhile I herded the cat into my room using a broom and shut the door.
While I was in there I found the green paint.
I hid in my shoebox of doom, but...
I thought about flushing it down the toilet.
It'd be rather pretty, actually.
Like that Tori Amos song.

Only green.

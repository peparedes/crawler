<P><FONT color=#ffffff><STRONG>I'm giving up on loving you I cant take the pain you've put me through Deep down I know the feelings are always there Maybe someday you will care At least for now I can hide my pain I know if I dont, I'll go insane Our time apart has made me realize There is no second chance when it comes to guys I almost had you back one timeBut of course, you changed your mind The many excuses that you have told Are getting lame and really old We never talk anymore Its like a room to ur life and u've slammed the door It hurts to know you've shut me out Now i know wut love is all about You're happy then u cry and cry Where there was truth becomes all lies All in all it never ends for good But then again, who thought it would?</STRONG></FONT></P>"

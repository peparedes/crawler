"event","heyo peeps, i found this great poem thing and i thought it was very good, it goes like this:

""daddy's day at school""

Her hair was up in a ponytail                                                
Her favourite dress tied with a bow
Today was daddy's day at school,
And she couldn't wait to go.

But her mommy tried to tell her,
That today she should stay home,
Why the kids might not understand,
If she went to shool alone.

But she was not afraid;
She knew just what to say.
What to tell her classmates
Of why he wasn't there today.

But still her mother worried,
for her to face this day alone.
And that was why once again, 
She tried to keep her daughter at home.

But the little girl went to school,
Eager to tell them all.
About a dad she never sees, 
A dad who never calls.

There were daddies along th wall in the back,
For everyone to meet.
Children squirming impatiently,
Anxious in their seats.

One by one the teacher called,
A student from the class.
To introduce their daddy,
As seconds slowly passed.

At last the teacher called her name,
Every child turned to stare.
Each of them was searching,
For a man who wasn't there.

""Where's her daddy at?""
She heard a boy call out.
""She probably doesn't have one,""
Another student dared to shout.

And from somewhere near the back
She heard a daddy say,
""Looks like another deadbeat dad
Too busy to waste his day.""

The words did not offend her,
As she smiled up at her mom.
And looked back at her teacher,
Who told her to go on.

And with hands behind her back, 
She slowly began to speak.
And out from the mouth of a child,
Came words incredibly unique.

My daddy couldn't be here,
Because he lives far away.
But i know he wishes he could be,
Since this is such a special day.

And though you cannot meet him,
I wanted you to know.
All about my daddy,
And how much he loves me so.

He loved to tellme stories
He taught me to ride my bike.
He suprised me with pink roses,
And taught me to fly a kite.

We used to share fudge sundaes,
And ice cream in a cone.
And though you cannot see him,
I'm not standing here alone.

""Cause my daddy's always with me,
Even tough we are apart
I know because he told me,
He'll forever be in my heart""

With that, her little hand reached up,
And lay across her chest.
Feeling her own heartbeat,
Beneath her favourite dress.

And from somewhere in the crowd of dads,
Her mother stood in tears.
Proudly watching her daughter,
Who was wise beyond her years.

For she stood up for the love
Of a man not in her life.
Doing what was best for her,
Doing what was right.

And when she droped her hand back down,
Staring straight into the crowd.
She finished with a voice so soft,
But its message clear and loud.

I love my daddy so much,
He's my shining star.
And if he could, he'd be here,
But heavens just too far

You see he was a fireman
And died this past year
When airplanes crashed into the towers
And taught americans to fear.

But sometimes when i close my eyes,
It's like he never went away.
And then she coses her eyes,
And saw him there that day.

And to her mother's amazement,
She witnessed with suprise.
A room full of daddy's and children,
All starting to close their eyes.

Who knows what they saw before them,
Who knows what they felt inside.
Perhaps for merely a second,
They saw him y her side.

""I know you're with me dady,""
To the silence she called out.
And what happened next made believers,
Of those once filled with doubt.

Not one in that room could explain it,
For each of their eyes had been closed.
But there on the desk beside her,
Was a fragrant long-stemmed pink rose.

And a child was blessed,
if only for a moment,
By the love of her bright shining star.
And given the gift of believing,
That heaven is not too far."

I wonder...what happens when we die? i mean there must be somewhere to go. if not then what happens to our consciousness? sometimes i think we just start as something else somewhere else, thats probably why do universe is so big. to stop us from getting to each other and telling them what will happen after they ""die"" in one place. i shure like to think that we go somwhere else and not extinguish and seize to exsist. that would mean that we would have to try and fulfil all our dreams and stuff in one lifetime. also if we only live once then it makes dying so cruel. you leave everything and everyone behind...how sad and depressing. hmm i guess i shouldn't think about that kind of thing. but i sometimes can't help it. oh well, im sure it will all be fine :)"

beauty. should it be from the inside or outside? a lot of people have asked me the question ""do you think i'm prety?"". i have to admit i do that aswell sometimes. but should it really matter how we physicaly look. should we spend all that time, fixing ourself up just to look physicaly attractive? i know i like to look my best but i wouldn't go to the lengths of plastic surgery to make myself look prety, or nice/pleasant to look at. i wouldn't buy these really weird, uncomfortable clothing to look prety or to atract someone. yet more and more people worrie about how physicaly atractive they are. beauty should not come from the outside but from the inside. it makes me sad to see people forget that beauty lies on the inside of someones heart. infact, being down right honest, there is this person i like (and he's kinda cute) but he seems to be boring me and in turn i seem to be falling for someone else, and it's not through how he looks on the outside but on how he looks on the inside. funny thing is, you never see how prety someone REALLY is until you've gone for the physicaly good looking one. i don't know, i guess some people would call me stupid coz i'm not ""ugly"" like them, but the fact is that i feel kinda unloved and through that i feel ugly. call me deppressing but that's how i think. maybe i'm wrong. dunno..."

"event","i've always wondered if everyone has a guardian angel. i mean if they do then what happens to the angel when the person it is protecing dies? does it get reassigned or something? can the angel be a real person or something, i mean it would explain (kinda) why some people wanna protect others or always wanting to be helpfull or something. but then wouldn't that just that just be being nice? i don't know anymore. i think it's time to ask for others view on this subject. so do you peeps think that angels can be ""normal"" everyday people? (sorry if this whole asking your opinion thing is annoying but...i don't know i just like hearing what people think)

weirdly enough i did a quizz on what type of girl you are (well the thing is that i'm not a girl but still) and i came out to be an angel. so does that mean i'm a human angel? or am i just really nice? who knows

"event","what is up with hugs?! i'm not saying this in an offesive way to this gesture of many meanings. it's weird...or maybe it's just me. sometimes i wanna hug someone but then i think...and then after a while it just seems weird. i've thought of huging someone but then as i ponder on it, it just becomes weird. so are hugs like a matter of growing used to them or something? (i will accept answers by the way so feel free to answer).

but yes today not so sunny but it's just as good as last entry...i think, yes now ""to infinity and beyond!!""

wow i'm the perfect princes. i think that might be slightly innacurate. i'm not that perfect. oh well, who cares i don't. the sun is shining very brightly today. i don't know why but i feel so light and happy...and no i'm not druged! i just feel so happy, i think my mood seems to go with the weather, it must be coz until now the weather has been a bit bad and i've been very touchy, but now the sun is shining all is well and i don't think anything can bring me down....although after saying that i'm sure the universe will do everything in it's power to bring me down. yay for the unfair universe!

with that not i'm sure i'll post another entry some time later today. but for now kisses and hugs for everyone i know and desides to read this (if you don't know me or have any doubts on my sanity, don't worry i'm just like this when i'm very happy)"

"event","the world is full of sadness today! i don't like it coz it makes me sad and styff :(

i wish everyone was happy and bad things never happened so that people would not get sad. i think i can do that but i'd have to become ruler of the world which seems rather unlikely, or wipe everyone of the earth so that there would be no one left to hurt or to sadden...but that would be psychopathic in every way, so i won't go for the second option. i guess i can't take the first one either coz i'm not fit to be a leader of any sort, i would just lead people to pending doom, which, altough sounds fun and exciting, isn't quite nice in any way.  

what if the world was infested with zombies! everyone would be too busy to hurt others coz we'd all be fighting the undead! regardless it hurts me when i see my friends get hurt. i want to do something to help them but i know that i can't do anything which makes me even sadder. 

well on that deppressing note i say ""In the name of the moon i will right wrongs and triumph over evil!"""

"event","today was kinda crapy, it rained. i also have some suspicions that Odin doesn't like me the way  i like him. i think i'll give up quite soon, coz i'm getting kinda bored of not knowing if he is or isn't intrested in me. i think i'll just have to ask him soon. then again there those moments where i think he is, but i'm never 100% sure. i don't know, but enough of Odin. it's the last day of the term!!! one week and two days of nothing but homework to do...fun. oh well just have to do it all.

"event","Well i came accross a boy whose name is Nick and he liked this boy called Odin. Now Nick liked Odin but he didn't know if Odin felt the same way, so i told him to gather courage and ask him if he knew of the situiation (partly coz according to unreliable sources, he and others knew of this matter). So Nick decides that he was gonna ask him after school. and you know what happened? i hope so coz i don't!!! 

i don't know what the point of this story was but it was prety lame...at least i think so. also i've learnt that if you gently stroke your knee cap then you get an orgasm!"

if people just want me to be this way then i rather just go die. people want me to die anyway. people wanna do this to me then i rather just die before school starts before this all gets worse. so thats my last decision. dying, your gonna die anyway so why just not die now and leave eveyrything you have when it all is gong to scrash down on you anyway, so if everybody wants to treat me like shit and dirt and dosent respect what i think and feel and dont care then im gonna give everybody what they want and die."

I'm sick of my football team im okay with everybody who played last year because they played with me and they know the game but the 7th graders are to cocky and they are going to get their heads ripped off monday!

 I cant wait til monday because we finally get to put that equipment on and beat the livng hel out of somebody and ive been playing football for 5 years of my life and i wasnt really good at it until i hit JTL football. SO FUCK ESYA FOOTBALL AND FUCK MONROE SAINTS! Its all about east burg south! I'm a very hardcore metal person but im very athletic and when people look at me like a punk rock person and they dont think im athletic it gets me so fuckin mad.

 Since im Hispanic and half black, im very good at basketball and football but when people look at me as a hardcore person and then they say oh, your just a punk rock your not athletic your probably a stoner! and i shove it right back in their face. and since ym dad comes from Europe im reallly good at soccer and ive been playing that for all my life and people look at me like i dont play any sports. So just wanna prove my point.

It was so damn funny cuz i met up with  matt which was gangster and thug (i just dont hang around with goths and punk rock people). They told me the simone which was my neighbor for 5 years and she was like my sister.

 They told me that she was going to get into a fight with some other chick named mallery. Then simone got 2 other girls and mallery got her 2 sisters. Then simone and some other girls saw mallery and her sisters. Then they started to yell and mallery's mother came and grabbed simone by the arm and started cursing.  Simone dosent take shit from no1 so simone dug her nails into her arm and then simone's mom came in.

 Mallery's mom started to call simone and her friwnds whores and simone's mom started swining and simone'e mother beat the shit out of mallery's and the cops came in because their were cops everyway because it was the crime watch. So they took simone's mom away. it was so funny. i had a pretty nice time. saw my juggalo steveE,"

The reason why im so pissed off is because me and jamie got into an arguemtn about me not seeing my juggalettes. Then she was like i dont want you hanging with girls and makes the whole big deal and then i remember that before i brung the point up of me seeing lettes. She was telling me how she is going to collin's and shit. How she is going to see some dudes and thats gets me so fuckin agrivated.

 I'm also very pissed off because i know she dosent believe me about being  at the doctor's in new york today, so i was like if you dont believe me then what ever. Then she would give me a hard time with that and then she would call and the only thing she would do is ignore me the whole entire phone call. Sh ecan talk 2 me for 3 minutes then at least talk to me for 3 minutes and not just ignore me. But w.e. i dont care. next time that happens im gonna hang up and let herself realize what she did. Im just gonna slip away. Im gonna go and chill with of my juggalos and juggalettes."

I dont wanna say it because im afraid that she will get mad and i do not want her to get mad at me at all because me and her are really good friends. I was so sad when i heard about what is wrong with her and she gets very sad over people talking about it so im not going to say it at all.

I went to camelbeach and we were in the wave pool and me and my friends were like this water was cold, and a group of kids came up to us and they were like get use to it you fuckin pussies. Then i was like you want beef, and the guy was like no i want chicken and i was like i know your fat ass wanst chicken. I aksed him if he knows what beef means and i was like let me put it in better words, do you want to get the shit beat out of you.

Then he was like no and me and roger and ryan stepped up to him and they backed up. They left the pool and and 2 hour later we saw of 2 of them in the arcade, the guy was like Brian and then he said he knew my name.I said oh yeah that tells you alot of about me, Go fuck your whore of a mother you have. Then i left the car racing game and got up in his face and pushed him.He pushed me back and mike and brianna were holding me back, I got pff and i said dont fuckin touch me and pucnhed him in the cheek and the decked him on his left eye and he ran away.

We had an archery contest which i sucked ass in so i quit.Their was some game where the camp counslers had to tag the campers and that was also gay. Then they played BINGO and that was super gay. This week is my last week at camp! Finally! i leave that gay camp and never come back. I had some pretty kick ass friends their who im probably never going to see again because they all live in stroudsburg but who cares. 

 I just got off the phone with jamie, she is doing some summer school work that she needs to do to pass because if she dosent pass then she dosent see me next year and that would really suck. I got in trouble today for almost shooting some one with an arrow from the bow i had. I shot it but i missed, so thats how much i suck at archery. I almost got kicked out of the cmap but since its my last week they let me off. All the camp counslers are either posers, preps, or some true ass metal heads.

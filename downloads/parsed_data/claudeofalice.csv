"event","I should get back to posting ... heres a quick update on things on my end.

So I graduated RIT suma cum laude with a major in New Media Information Technology. Im here in the summer working on various odd jobs and finishing up one more course. Then I will be in Rochester for two more years getting my Masters degree in Game Design and Development. Should be cool.

Last quarter was one of the more painful, but we got some amazing stuff done. Made a game called Aliens which Microsoft has recently approached us about and wants to use for something or other at their Microsoft Games Summit. Thats huge news. A very big deal for us. Then we will also be polishing it up and submitting it to IGF to see if we win anything.

Then I also finished up the new media showcase project which we are hoping to get an FWA award for . innovated some cool technologies and will be writing a paper up on it.

Also started a company. DarkWind Media llc. We are currently doing like medical visualization stuff but we hope to move around into like educational software and then eventually game development. We have an office on John St in Rochester and its pretty sweet. I mean, it could collapse and I could end up working at another company, but also who knows it might work out and it might be my full time job being a business owner. Could be pretty sweet. Nows the time to take risks like this.

Aside from our service positions, we are developing a technology that we really hope could be a big step forward in media on the web. We will see how things work out and perhaps I will post more as the progress comes.

Bai. Sorry to all I have failed to keep in touch with."

I finish up my undergrad this year, which is exciting. Im heading a team for a competition here at RIT where we are developing a 2d game to go in an arcade box. its made me realize that I really love the management side of game development, and being the head of a team ... so thats what Im going to aim for in life (broad goal i know). This quarter ive been on co-op for adellion making art assets for teh game and stuff. next quarter i return to classes. I will have three part time jobs next quarter. I will be working part time for adellion, TA / Grading for 434 Programming for Digital media, and developing software for Dr. Craig in the new biosciences building. The software i am developing is medical simulation stuff. right now im working on a proposal to expand the project. Expanding the project would make the software pretty much rawk, and take advantage of full cave technology and stereoscoping projecting. if the propsoal goes through, it might be a feature presentation at Strong Museum here in Rochester, which would really rock . 

We won our division 2 volleyball championship last quarter. We lost our division 2 soccer championship in the finals by 1 point which really blew.

"event","So according to an article I just read, BMW is supposedly testing its hydrogen combustion engine based 7 series car right now. BMW said that in two years they would have hydrogen combustion engines and it seems they wernt kidding. Heres to all the doubters. Im glad capitalism played is proper part.

Now its very important to tread carefully from here. To set up the standards for hydrogen use before hand so that we dont get caught a few years down the line in a tangled web of poor technology.

I think its possible that our government now needs to come in and help this transition along. Assuming BMW actually figured it out (and lets just assume for now) what do you think is the proper step for our government? I dont think private industry will be able to fully handle itself in this situation. I think its time the government start some more serious spending to transition stations to hydrogen and other automotive companies to hydrogen .

Also, I think Duffer would be pretty miserable with three legs. The cancer got to a point where he was just bleeding everywhere and honestly wasnt a happy pooch, so i think hes being put down right now.<br /><br />Its very very sad. Duffys been around since I was 8. I cant quite figure out what grade that was ... 3rd or 4th? Something like that. Anyways; its just been a long time, and now knowing that I wont be able to go home and see him is discomforting. There are a lot of Duffisms threaded into the very fabric of my home life. The noise he makes coming down the stairs is a very particular one; jingling collar, quirky footsteps ... probably a shake at the bottom of the stairs and the noise of his claws hitting hard wood. Or then theres the noise of being one floor below Duffy while he scratches - the thumping noise on the ceiling. And finally, the sound of his body being tossed up against the metal door in the backyard as he attempts to get our attention to be let in.<br /><br />Very discomforting and very sad. Ill misser the doofer. Misser the doofer very much. Very much lubbered the doofer.<br /><br />On another note- Im afraid there are two events that were going on late this week / this weekend that are looking more dismal as to my attendance.

"event","I just wanted to make a quick post regarding long upcoming political elections.

I heard from someone, and if that someone is on live journal or reads this journal or knows who said it (I think it was Mark F. actually ... so please point yourself out) something along the lines of ""You can tell a polititians honesty by how strong he or she goes against video games.""

I thought this was a really interesting quote . And very true . Video games are the ""hot topic"" on capital hill. Its what everyone wants to hear about and have regulated. While we have real issues going on in the country ... DEFINITELY some more pressing ones ... the big thing to stand against is video games. So if you are a polititian and HONESTLY jump against video games, shooting off quips and phrases about family values and how games are crumbling our society, then you really arent an honest polititian. Instead of looking out your window and observing societies ails, your head is stuck in a poll report generated by your PR that tells you what topic Americans want to hear about. Telling you what will get you the furthest ahead.

Isnt that when politics turn dirty anyways? Isnt that where the ideals run dry? its when people make a career of being in the government that their personal agenda becomes more important than ... well, logic. Not to say I can think of a better system.

American McGee recently posted in a similar style to the Fight Club post that I made a month or so back, citing articles of violence spurred from American Idol and a man bludgeoning another man to death with a sausage. Is it time for a ban on American Idol? Or sausages? Or maybe the two cant be in the same place together at the same time? Maybe Sausage sales must be banned during the airing of american idol ... that should curb the violence right?

Of course not. And the violence brought about by both the sausage and the american idol still toll up to more violence than video games have actually caused.

Just another reason why Hilary Clinton deserves no position of power. Or maybe she could use a good sausage bludgeoning."

Highlights include a run to the Pacific Ocean, rejection, a minor character becoming a major character and offsetting the whole system, reality being changed at key dramatic moments, deliberate malicious acts to hurt the protagonist (me of course), hurt shock awe and a sunrise."

"event","So I just got back from American School in Japan graduation ... which is where Danny and a bunch of the people Ive met here go to school . Its really weird ... I hang out with highschool kids here in Japan and its oddly an amazing, refreshing feeling. Its like being back in high school again ... except this time, Im really really popular ... I act like a totally different person,&nbsp; and I do totally different things ... and its all the highschool-ness too ... the fun, the lovin, the drama (which I have become quite involved in myself) ... it all fills me with regrets and the like . I feel really creppy sometimes, being the 4th year college kid hanging out with highschool kids ... but Im honestly having the time of my life. Like I missed something in high school and now Im making up for it.

The graduation was like any graduation ... excxept with half japanese people. The validictorian gave what i thought was a very interesting talk on authenticity . There was a senior slide show playing ""Time of your Life"" in the background ... and as I watched the slideshow, I felt like Ive been here forever. I knew so many people in the slides ... knew their history, have done stuff with them, have become intermingled in their lives. As kids were walking by in their hat and gowns, they were waving to me. I would consider a lot of these people my friends ... a lot of them . They are pretty incredible.

The whole thing makes me feel weird and old really. I was at a party the other night and there were a bunch of what i thought were old looking guys there. Im so used to being young I felt intimidated around them. I later asked one of my friends how old those guys were and she said they were like ... college freshman. i asked her if I looked that old and she said no, you look way older.

I guess something that makes me feel like im around old people is that ... if I were hanging out with highschoolers in America, what would we do? go to richardsons or mingolf? Here, you walk around the bars and the highschoolers are everywhere. Ive drunk and clubbed with highschool freshman . While these people ARE young, they also happen to be more mature than many of the people I know at RIT because in America I still cant go out to bars. So few people are giving that oppurtunity to mature due to our, what i would consider rediculous, drinking age.

Anyways- Im having the time of my life. Its not even a japanese time of my life anymore ... its a creppy high school time of my life. Forgive me for being creepy . My ego is through the roof . People like me out here and thats a great feeling. Im going to miss a lot of people ... too much I think. Im a changed person for it all . 

Anyways- time for me to go out to the post grad party ... this is going to be rediculous ... its going to be the climax of all the drama thats been going on for the last few weeks ... its exciting ... i get to like participate in all this drama and interact with these people and everyone knows that it ends in a few weeks when i and they all leave to go to college and never go back. This party is going to be craaaaaaazy ..."

<p>[quote]Men involved in fight clubs often carry bottled-up violent impulses learned in childhood from video games, cartoons and movies, said Michael Messner, a University of Southern California sociology and gender studies professor.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay ... now Im not TOO worked up over this article because the statement DID mention cartoons and movies and didnt single out games... but did anyone else read this article and find the inclusion of videogames at all just an unnessessary stab? Not only that, but isnt this a perfect example of how movies are equally if not more influential in causing violence among youths and adults? Particularly in an article where the entire thing is about Fight Clubs and how they are created based off the movies . CNN pushes an article about kids and adults beating the hell out of each other based off a movie, no one listens. On the other end of the hypothetical stick, I bet if MSNBC wrote an article about a 12 year old boy that told his mom he would ""Beat her back to Age of Empires"" (A quote from Age of Empires II or III), each piece of the political pie would scamper up to take first dibs on a new crusaide against the downfall of society.</p>
<p>Not to bring up something thats been overgrilled, but every day i continue to be astounded by the bad reputation games get for their quips and quirks and how rarely people decide to take action against films . I mean look at it ... can anyone cite an example of Hot Coffee mod inciting a teenager to run out and get a hooker and contract some disease from it? Or how about God of War causing one student to to grab another with a sword-on-chain and tear him into two? Has Rockstar really increased Automotive Theft, and has anyone ever run over a chain of joggers screaming ""Jumbalaya!!""?</p>
<p>Honestly. Just picture the heat that would be brought if there was an article like this, replace ""Fight Club"" with ""Street Fighter"". There would be no end in sight. Is that just? Can someone actually do that for me? CNN? MSNBC? Slashdot? Just please take this article word for word and switch in the term ""Street Fighter"" with ""Fight Club."" It would be quite the social experiment.</p>
<p>Here are direct examples of pre-teens, teens, adults, being taught by movies how to do these fight clubs to ""escape the drugery of our fake lives and feel something real"" (sound familiar, Chuck Palahniuk?) and no one really cares. And why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Im guessing Lieberman enjoys a saturday night at Lowes as much as the next guy. Clearly, then, its an art form and is protected under freedom of speech expression and the rest.</p>
<p>I am just repeating whats been said a thousand times. I hate to do it, but Im just wishing that for once someone would pull their asses out of their polls and listen.</p>
<p>Good night, and Good luck.</p>"

Sony's major selling point on the system is that it doubles up as a Blu-Ray player, one of two upcoming standards for HD video to replace DVD. In order to alleviate system criticism, Sony has decided to release a cheaper model of the ps3 console (dual-model sales first done by XBox360 back in 2005), which is missing a few key features, such as no immediate wi-fi support and no HDM-I video output ... this puzzles many, since the a system being dual-marketed as a HD Video player will lack the ability to actually OUTPUT high definition video on the slightly cheaper model ... as the fires rage at Sony, the rumour mill has dug up a recent patent filed by Sony reading ""When a person purchases a Sony game, they no longer purchase the game itself but only a licence to play the game."" What this in turn means is that the person who purchases the game has no right to sell the game back to EBGames or wherever they bought it, thus doing away with the ""PrePlayed Games"" section in stores which has become so popular. In a way, I believe this is a strong financial move, since with Preplayed Games, the retailer is merely double-dipping in the financials and leaving the developer and publisher out of new profits entirely. However, this also does away with any rental stores and leaves a lot of gamers, already pissed at Sony, just a little more pissed off. No doubt, Nintendo will just sit there smiling and Microsoft will run around, tattling on Sony, saying ""See?? See?? They are big jerk! Love us more!""<br /><br />And now for my <strong>GUESS THIS SONG</strong> quote ...<br /><br />""If love is surrender, then whose war is it anyways? ...

"event","Not to step outside of my realm of game politics and enter the world of real politics ... but am I the only one poop-in-pants terrified of China? It doesnt help that from my window at work I can see not only the Yasukuni jinjya and the imperial palace (the chinese hate Yasukuni jinjya) but ... lets look at the facts.

China is big and scary and frighteningly wealthy. Look at their economics. Everything they do is geared to pull money in and let NOTHING go. Everything is made in china. Nothing is imported to china. When you enter china, every . single . person is trying to sell you something. Every American penny you spend in China increases their national worth. They dont let people leave china. It costs a Chinese native 50,000 just to leave the country. At their salaries, which come to something like ... 50 dollars a week on average or something like that? Its impossible. Because no one leaves the country, none of their money leaves the country. INFACT, if you manage to get one family member out of the country, he will move to America, work a job there, and mail money back to his family ... Hell, even their gameboys are geared to bring money in. China is an economic black hole , sucking in money so fast that even light cant escape . Can we continue to ignore this?

Where is the money going? Entirely into Chinas desire to control . It goes into the military, it goes into securing Chinas ability to produce more complex goods in china, such as advanced electronics, ruling out America and Japans remaining industry. It goes into their desire to control standards so that only they can produce goods (look at the battles between IEEE 802.xx and china)

What do you get when you couple a communist country with probably close to 15% of the world population, a majority of those being horny males without wives, a desire to become THE world leader, economic wealth, the brains to feed of live-in-the-now american businesses, and a population that can make a better living in the military than they could in the factories?

News Flash: China moves 400,000 troops opposite Taiwan, along with 700+ short range missiles. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, for some historical reason I have yet to research. China says it will invite Taiwan if it tries to make an act of independance.

America states that it will defend Taiwan in the case of an invasion.

...

Im sorry, I just pooped a little ... doesnt this frighten anyone else? Wake up!

Oh , and by the way- for those who want to nitpick, all of my facts are really skewed . This is not an objective post at all. And Im not really pooping myself. I dont like to believe in panic over politics. So those who are much smarter than me and research harder than me and know more about the subject than I do, please feel free to tear me apart. For those that take no interest in the world around them and havent considered any of this before, maybe you should read this and treat it seriously."

Im addicted to this new lifestyle . I find myself sitting at work thinking of nothing but going out at night . Ive lost my interest in so many things . 

In three weeks Im going back to Rochester. Im going to return to the bullshit drugery of sitting around all day and working on my project all so I can win some competition . Nothing is exciting . Never leaving my apartment . Never meeting new people or playing the game .

Even going out at RIT is bullshit . Its going to the same few peoples apartments to sit around and chat and do nothing . Nothing ever happens .

Someone save me . I know I need some sort of fix or something to change my life ."

"event","Hey guys- i know i havent been talking too much about Japan since ive been here ... and I have a lot to talk about when it comes to Japan ... but this post isnt going to be about Japan either.

I cant remember what Ive posted in the last 6 or so months, but Im going to assume nothing and just tell you quickly how life is going and where life is going etc.

So yeah- life is going good. This last year was very important for me because it began my transition into professionalism really. Ive begun taking all the skills that I want to apply when I work (as a game developer, for those who have forgotten) and bring them up to speed with whats currently the standard so that I may do a proficient job in the field.

-Its been a blast and its really been a great experience. Im finally taking my programming to the next level by learning C++ and DirectX , which are really the game development and general coding standards. I used to work with javascript mostly, which is good for some thigns but rarely applicable to game development.
-Ive begun to learn real 3d packages like 3ds max and maya, rather than just modeling in WorldCraft (aka Hammer Editor). WorldCraft was great for learning principles and styles, but really 3ds max and maya are what are used in video games and movies. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like right now I could actually do a proficient job in certain topics as a game developer if I were to just model.
-With sound and music, I am trying to broaden myself from the 1:00, repetitive songs I used to write in a little bit of time and work on prolonged projects in a professional manner (start to finish.) I no longer use FruityLoops and I use ProTools, which is a professional standard for music creation. I also am using professional sound banks for composition. Ive always wanted to write music as beautiful as some of the stuff heard in movies or games, and now the only thing separating me from it is practice and talent.
-Ive been taking more leadership roles in my projects. This is really my oppurtunity to practice leadership skills as well as gain confidence in my decisions. Since I really would like to run my own company some day, I know this is important to learn.

So Im still the jack of all trades when it comes to game development, and Im not too happy about that. Its definitely not a compliment to be the jack of all trades. The jack of all trades can do it all but is good at nothing. But I enjoy doing everything so much that its hard for me to neglect. And I really dont want to sound cocky, but despite doing it all I still feel like I am able to compete with others.

Also with all this and with all my success in school Ive really found Im getting egotistical. Im #1 in GPA and work quality in my major and have been picked up by professors to do all sorts of work for them, including help make a new major at the school. By the end of my first year I was told by a professor that I was the best student shes ever had and I was hired by my second year to get paid to do develop programs for a psych institute. The two directors of my major consult in me regarding what courses should be offered. All my peers really seem to respect me and like ... I donno its really hard to keep my feet on the ground sometimes. (This last paragraph wasnt me trying to be egotistical ... so ... please dont think that ... its just my honest observation in my own personal journal.)

Anyways , point being . I really dont want to be cocky, and I feel bad among my friends and piers when I act that way. Sometimes Im joking , but I dont think they pick up on that. I do have big dreams and I am being ambitious, but I dont honestly think Im THAT great. If you Lynnfieldians or whoeverians see me and think im being cocky ... just tell me. I dont want to be this way and Ill do anything to keep my feet on the ground.

I wont be around this summer as I am participating in a game competition here at RIT that needs my fullest attention. Sorry guys. And then I have another game competition in the fall . i will keep u posted on all of it tho.

Okay- huge post. Back to work . BAI.

Oh and PS- I will hopefully be posting work in here (art, music, games, whatever) in the near future."

Without getting to socialpolitical, I would like to plead to Uwe Boll to stop making movies. Maybe this is wrong for me to say as I havent seen any of his movies- but maybe therein lies the heart of the issue. Uwe Boll is the director of the recently released / releasing BloodRayne the movie (based off the video game). The movie, which holds a 5% from rotten tomato, is about a vampire killing nazis. And I havent seen it- but I saw the trailer. And just by looking at the trailer I can firmly say that it sucks hard. Harder than I can believe. Im confident enough to say that I could direct a film better than this guy could. Im confident enough to say that 50% of the people I know could.

So why do I want him to stop making movies? Was anyone aware of his two previous movies? Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead? Both based off the video games. both scoring 1/10 as far as my brief research goes.

I want him to stop because he is the fat kid in first grade spitting on the plate of brownies so no one will eat them but him. And it wouldnt be so bad that he was eating them, except that hes a fat kid and sucks at eating brownies. He is scooping up game after game and making crappy movies about them. Not only tarnishing the great name that video games could one day maintain in the movie industry, but consuming valuable, potential ideas. And I wouldnt care so much about his movies if he stuck to bloodrayne titles. titles without a strong storyline or potential in my personal opinion. But my problem is with two of his next three movies; Dungeon Seige and Farcry

So please. Stop making movies."

However , the majority of that statement is true . When we walked around the area with the vandalism, we always found on things that I believe are ... I almost want to say more 'ok' to vandalise . Underneath bridges maybe is one place, but also on like the fold down garage doors and on concrete slabs. There was one building that was very 'chic' and it was made of wood and glass and then right next to it were three very dileberate concrete slabs . On the chic slabs were graffiti ... but almost like it was there intentionally . No one grafittid the building or carved things into the wood -- actions that actually damage the building or piss someone off . They didnt vandalize the glass or anything . So its almost like the vandalism there was 'artistic' or 'cultural' and was never there to just get someone mad.<br /><br />Another thing, we went into this park where a lot of homeless are . And it was interesting , because they were all in this park ... and they all had like little houses that they built out of plywood and a blue tarp. They were actually quite elaborate, with clothes lines and stuff. Just shows you- when you go homeless here you never stop working, you always keep striving for something and keep trying to climb to the top. there was one of the homeless tents that had a teeny tiny little bar in it and some seats and was selling noodles like a little restaurant.<br /><br />to <span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" alt="""" />d_angel</span>, Im living in Shibuya-ku. It is very close to [i forget the park name] and [i forget the station name but it houses the green line and another line] . Its in Northern Shibuya-ku and its about a 15 minute walk from Shibuya station (for those of you who dont know it, you should research it . The picture at the top of my post is a picture of Shibuya crossing at daytime . Its supposedly the words biggest crossing. I cant find the number now, but i saw a documentary and it said the crossing had like some rediculous number of people cross a day. Okay, I just spent a long time finding the stats. 1,500 people cross every time the light changes. Up to a quarter million people cross per day. My apartment is also right across from Harajuku. Both areas are real youth oriented areas. <span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" alt="""" />d_angel</span>, where did you stay in Japan?<br /><br />Thats all for now ...

Its got more square feet that I feel like my house at home does, and its right in tokyo. Its got 2 massive plasma TVs , amazing modern layout, 4 bathrooms (with high tech toilets that have automatic bum cleaners, odor eliminators, female cleaners, and heated seats.) and just overall roxxingness. I havent spoken too much japanese thusfar beause im a scared little boy. When I start my job, however, I will likely find myself speaking more and more.<br /><br />Things are rocking out here. The city is beyond words and belief, as are the people. There isnt a single speck of vandalism anywhere. Anywhere. Even down the sketchiest back alley . Is it because they have security cameras everywhere? No ... they just lack whatever it is that makes Americans do stuff to just piss people off. In america, if someone put, say, a brilliant clay vase on the doorway to their inner city apartment, within a week someone would come by and write something on it , or break it . Why? For no reason other than to piss that person off. Here, that desire doesnt exist . At all . So much that there isnt one person out of the thousands that does one of the things. So what does this mean? It means that the subways all have really nice TV screens built into the walls that do awesome stuff like play funny commercials and give english lessons and they dont worry about anyone coming by and covering it in Sharpie. It means that there are really funny vending machines down a lot of back alleys and not one has crap written on it and they are all well maintained . If you lose your wallet here, chances are that someone will return it . The department stores have wide open front doors , no security checkpoints , and the stores themselves are like mazes with no 'security' or employes . you could so easily stick something in ur pocket and walk out ... but for some reason, people just dont there. Not even the poor. There isnt someone checking ur bag as you walk out. There arent employees that walk up to you constantly asking if you need help with anything to defer you from thieving. It is the most amazing thing ever . its like there is a lack of selfishness here too . The waiters and waitresses have so far given a better service than I have probably ever seen, are extremly polite ... and there is no tipping here. you dont and cant tip . if you try to tip , they will refuse it.<br /><br />Oh , and there are no guns because they just arent legal . There arent a collection of rednecks defending an outdated constitutional right. So therefore, you can walk around without being afraid of someone like ... owning you . Which doesnt happen too often anyways. Oh , and another thing, people dont 'sue' like they do in america. People wont sue the government if they trip on a street curb . Oddly enough , its sort of visible and I sort of like it . Like , things are built to look cool and everything isnt padded . I dont know how to explain it , but its really noticible.<br /><br />The whole place rocks . its a busy as hell city , but no one honks their horn . No one throws trash on the ground . its unbelievable really ... and in fact, the only bad people that cause trouble are the foreigners ... and yet still we dont get any discrimination except from maybe the cops ... how is this???"

We needed another car because evan and shay have their licenses now, and i had the honda up at RIT. But my parents definitely did not need to get me such a nice car, and im really really really happy and thankful, because this is seriously like my dream car. Not many people like Celicas, but I fell in love with them for some reason like the first time i saw them . Its been the only car ive really liked ... and for some reason the moment i see one i just jump with joy and say ""Look a celica!""</P>
<P>Now I have my own and I am just ecstatic beyond belief and Im really happy and i want to go drive it and if i had a tail id wag it!</P>

Anyways; lots to update but one story I just really wanna tell. I went to Stompfest , which is like this party out in the middle of no where in a field and it extends over the entire weekend. My friends sister is a big part in it, so he had me and beej (and he is Scott) go up. Honestly, I thought it would be awkward because I was told that there wouldnt be many people my age there, and there honestly wasnt, and of course being one of those hippy gatherings in the middle of no where there would just be old people waltzing around , tripping on just about every drug imaginable. I had hoped we would show up and just leave at about 9 .

Instead though, I found I had like a blast. One of the happyist nights of my life actually. I met some really cool people, and also ... get this! For the first time of my life I actually like ... socialized with ... *whispers* members of the opposite sex! Thats right , I actually like comfortably conversed and hung out with these two girls from University of Buffalo while I was there , and they were just very nice and flattering and kind and a blast to hang around. (( cute too ^_^ )) They were TOTALLY hitting on me ;-)Anyways; It was just a really incredible night for me.

THEN, as I went to find my tent as we parted ways, I walked into a horseshoe stake . (the thing you toss horseshoes on) and cut my leg pretty deep. I was too tired to care, and wasnt in any position to get it fixed , so I slept with it, but in the morning I went to the hospital and needed 8 stitches :-\ its actually a pretty nasty wound ... so now Im going to have a really nice scar on my leg, and im actually really happy I will, because whenever i see it i will remember how much fun I had.

"event","Over the last - I don't know how many months I've been busy reading. I Don't know how many books I've read. I've read novels which I'd class as fantasy because they are to do with fall in love with vampires and another book about another world that sounds like heven with lush grass, waterfalls and countless edible things. I've read discriptive crimonology novels, novels with cultural and religious themes. I'm now reading a novel about silents or selective mutism to be exact. 

It's rather interesting slipping into someone elses world, someone elses life and escaping for a while. It's like being on holiday in your own living room. 

At night though I write in my own journal, not this one- one that I hand write, one that cover emotions and thoughts things that are private and only I'm aloud to know. It helps me to know who I am and how to fix my own troubles.

At night also read a few pages of my community development book in the hope that it will one day help me get into the course I want.  It explains how opression, power and feels of superiority in our society are damaging. How the charity model isn't helpful because dishing out handouts and doing things for others doesn't help them get their lives on track. How one must assist people to figure out what their needs are and work out how they can be met. It's like teaching other problem solving so they help themselves out of trouble."

The dream stated last monday which was probably the 3/10/05. Danny tells me we are getting married on monday the 10th of October at 1:30pm. I tell Tina we are getting married along with the date and the time. Then my dream skips to the wedding day 1:15pm and I come to the realisation that I haven't organised to get my hair done at the hair dresses and I haven't got a wedding dress. I'm not living where I am now I'm living some where that has red dirt and it's dusty like it hasn't rained and across the road from us is a shop that does wedding dresses for hire and sells them. So I go over to the shop and when I walk in there's only three racks of with wedding dresses and the rest of the shop is filled with books and reminds me of a library. I ask the shop keeper what's going on and they inform me that they are changing the business from wedding dresses to books. I have a look at the wedding dresses and I notice that the ones in my size are ugly or the dressers are too big. So I remember I have a nice formal brown dress and decide that, that would have to do. I am slightly disappointed that I didn't get to wear something a little more special, but I then I think to myself that's my stupid fault I have a week to get a dress and wait till the last 15minutes. Some how I'm at the wedding I've already said my vouls although I didn't seem myself doing it in the dream. Danny and I are signing the thing and as we do this I whisper in his I forgot to organise the reception and he replies - It's ok Mum did all that. Then we get to the reception I'm not sure how, I see Tina, I go over to her and ask how she knew where the wedding was cause I'd fotten to tell her and she says I just knew it would be there. 

I think this dream is about me managing my anxiety and not being aware of time."

I know my carpet needs vaccuming, my computer screan needs a wipe, my car needs a wash and I should finish the last play of the Jack Manning trilogy by David Williamson but frankly today I can't be stuffed I'm just not in the mood, but I'm so Bored. I know I'm whinging again and I know it's self inflicked boredom, but hey you got to admitt we all have days like these don't we?"

It's a way of being in the moment - there's no past or future only a here and now  - a difficult concept for me. So I'm focusing on my breathing and my voice the way it vibrates through my throat and suddenly I not thinking of these things, I'm dead to the world sleep has arrived hooray."

Last night I had trouble getting to sleep but I managed it in the end. I was so anxious last night it took a while to calm down. I don't even know why I was anxious maybe I'm getting to the point where I'm afraid to go to bed incase I can't sleep, which I've course increases anxiety and makes sleep harder to come by. I feel like I'm on the verge of a cold a lot due to being run down through lack of sleep."

"event","As far as writting goes I'm trying to be good this month. They say a writter should write every day and it doesn't matter whether the writting is good or not it just has to be done. I think it's so you can have you thoughts, feels and something of the day on paper -  that way you can use it all later down the track to write something fantastic. Besides it's like recording history anyway because latter down the track if you have children or something they can read it and find out the kind of person you were before you got old. Writting immortalises your soul because then you live on in the memories of others who have the writing. You'll never be forgotten. Writting is also theraputic when your an anxious person like me, you write down all your worries and then you don't have to think of them anymore -it makes it easier to sleep at night. I think Paul Bateman said 'write today what slipped into your soul yesterday.' I like that one. I met him a Rotunda, in Sunbury which is appart of the Victorian University - they call it Rotunda Community Writting Center."

The vet gave her an injection and some pills. Fizz has lost a kg too so that's good she can afford to put a little bit of weight back on for winter."

Wendy asks 'Have you ever been to Southland Ang?'
'No' I  reply.
'Yes you have with me.' Danny says.
Angie is so tired still she has no idea what she's saying. Although she gets the subtle hit that their not going to Watergardens anymore. Wendy had made plans with Angie to see a movie after dropping Danny off. Danny is dropped at Cheltenham station and then Wendy and Angie head off to Southland for there movie.

"event","Angie left Danny stilling packing in motel room, while she returns the key to reception. On the way over there she notices a wallaby eating the motel garden. She hands the key over and the guy says,
'Have a safe trip home.'
'Yeah I will thanks.' Angie replies. She returns to the motel room to help Danny load the car and they pull the motel door shut. It's now locked - too bad if we left anything behind now. They get in the car, which takes a few goes to start, the poor old thing doesn't like the cold. Danny and Angie leave the motel and head in the direction of Stawell. Angie notices her outside mirror is askew, Danny must of walked into one of them. It's now pointing at the door, so she informs Danny they'll have to stop in Stawell to fix it before they enter the highway. She knew that's where she'd need it, with all the lane changes. 

At Stawell they make their way on to the highway in the signs point them to Ballarat. When they get to Ararat Angie pulls into an angle park of the highway and they cross the road to the Mcdonalds,  the one that Tina, Baker and Angie use to meet at to eat lunch or breakfast and say their last goodbyes before the holidays on the way home for the holidays. Danny and Angie aren't hungry, so Angie takes just takes advantage of the toilets. They then walk up to the sign at the traffic light to see what lane they need to be in and whether they're meant to turn. It says Ballerat, Melbourne straight ahead, so that's where we go when the lights turn green. Angie does lots of micro-stops after that, she's so tired. Danny wishers he could take over and help with the driving but unfortunately he doesn't have a licence.  They make it to Beaufort sometime around 11, fill up with fuel and have a milk shake. Eventually they hit the road again and have a few more mirco-stops along the way Angie's become even more increasingly tired and isn't sure how she'll mangage the rest of the trip. When Angie sees the Bacchus Marsh turn off she's pritty excited but she has no idea where she is when she comes out. She pulls into a caravan park for directions - the same one she stopped at 4 years back when she was coming home from a wedding in Warriknabeal and did the same thing asked for directions to Gisbourne. She get's the same answer as she did back then and feels like a twit. As she's driving along she see the exit she should of taken - she should of stayed on the highway that little bit longer and she would of come out where she got on the previous Saturday."

They opt to eat outside which turns out to be a bad move as wasps hang around Danny's pizza, so they end up taking their meals back inside. After their meal, Angie and Danny are pritty full but deside to go to the ice cream palour for an ice cream. Danny goes for the spearmint choc-chip. Angie goes for the english toffee.

"event","Angie and Danny are off to see the big koala today. Something Danny didn't know existed. It's half way between Stawell and Horsham at Dadswells bridge - not sure if that's the right spelling.  Angie takes Danny over to the giant koala and puts his hand on the koala's claws to give him an idea on the size of the thing. They then walk into the restraunt part where they have a hot chocolate each with marshmello's by the wood heater.

11:00
Angie and Danny headed for Longerenong Agricultural College out past Horsham in a town called Dooen. Angie used to go to the college as a residential student in 1996-97. So she wants to show Danny where she spent the end of her teenage years. She could say she wanted to show him where she spent her youth but that would be a lie because she doesn't see herself as old. In her mind you are as old as you feel and her thoughts are if your a parent you have a reason to feel old but children should make you young - not  that she has any children of course. Danny is suprised at the length of the college drive way claiming that he didn't think the place would be that big. Angie thinks it's a farm, it's meant to be big. She is both excited and sad to the old place. Excited because it's like a home coming, Angie has so many happy memories in this place. Memories of sitting on Teen's bed talking for all hours of the night about nothing in particular. Memories of the two security guards that Teen and her favoured. The long talks to them in the night. Getting drunk one night and loosing her toothbrush. Memories of scott and how protective he was of me. Memories of Scott and Baker having chair races up and down the corridor and how the chairs would break and they'd have to stop and fix the wheels on to the chairs again. Memories of spending an afternoon throwing stubbie holders on to the window awnings. However Angie is sad that the place is so dry and barron, the last time she came up here the paddocks yeilded good crops and everything was green. She remembers walking into a paddock and how the mud stuck to her gumboots making her ten foot taller.  Now it's bare, there are no crops, no mud. The paddocks are dry and every thing errie and dead. There's more danger of a dust storm then getting bogged.   

Angie finds the residential quarters and nothing much has changed there. Danny and Angie walk the long corridor and a familar voice calls out. They turn and Angie can't believe her eyes the cleaner from her day standing there with a cloth in his hands. Brian is his name but the students had nicknamed him Happy - at least that's what he was called back then. He tells Angie and Danny how he's been sacked and reinstated so many times and how in the end they must of thought he's the best man for the job because he's back doing it. 
Angie asks 'Is anyone living in my old room?'
'No' he replies and leads them there. Angie can't believe he still remembers what room she was in.  He opens it up and Angie shows Danny around.
She comments 'It still smells of bloody mice.' The cleaner, Angie and Danny all laugh.
'You'll never get rid of that.' the cleaner says with a grin.  Danny and Angie go down stairs to the cafe quadrangle notice board and Angie looks at the staff list, suprised to see so many familiar faces.  Brian or Happy the cleaner walks past us and informs us that Gus is up at the tec block - so that's where Angie and Danny head next. On the way to the tec block they hear the sound of a diesel engine, a student taking a tractor back to the machinary shed.  Danny and Angie arrive at the tec block and Angie opens the door and they both walk in.  Angie see's Gus in his office, his on the phone. So they wait in the door way. Angie introduces Gus and Danny. 
Gus asks 'What have you been doing with yourself?'
'Not much. I had a job for a little while on a puppy farm but it went brock so they had to let me go. I'm thinking of doing a community services course.' Angie replies. 

Angie asks Gus 'What happened with AI heifers? The one that the herriford bull got at. Were they mainly Belgian blues?'
'Yes' Gus replies. 'We got more belgian blues then herrifords despite Tina's out cries.'
'That's alright then. I always wondered about that. I still speak to Tina. She's running a post office in Tassie now and she's married.' Angie says.
'Did she marry that film producer bloke?' Gus asks.
'Yes' Angie replies.
'Last I heard she was feeding cow's in Queensland.'
'Yeah, well her husband didn't have a job and couldn't seem to get work, so she brought the post office to get him working.' Angie replied.
'She must be loosing her touch.' Gus says.
The three of them laugh.

Angie and Danny make it back to the visitors car park where Angie parked the car. Angie didn't even know there was a visitors car park till today. Angie feels exhausted, she wants to sleep and doesn't know how they'll make it back to the motel but some how they do."

"event","Danny and Angie finally pluck up the courage to brave the cold and get out of bed. Danny's having a shower which runs at a trickle, while Angie makes herself some toast. She stands at the heater while she waits for it to cook. After Angie is finished the toast and Danny's out the shower they trade places. Danny makes himself and Angie a cup of tea. Angie sips hers through a straw and tastes the lumps of pea and ham soup remains, she thought she'd washed the dishers obviously not to well. Danny didn't have lumpy tea so she must of washed his cup properly.  The pair laugh at pea and ham tea, it is such a peculiar flavour. 

11:00
Danny and Angie head of to Brambuk Koori education centre. There are many plarks all over the grounds; some educating them on the healing powers of particular native plants, others on weaving baskets, some on grounding reeds to make flour for a kind of damper biscuit. There where plarks to do with Wattle tea, plarks about possuem skin clokes and canoe building. Danny and Angie are amazed. 
Angie says 'I didn't learn any of this at school.'
Danny replies 'No neither did I.'

Danny and Angie end up in a building the shape of a cockatoo the koori totem for the area and inside are all these little rooms to do with fire stick farming, the european invasion and much much more. Danny and Angie climb to the top of a ramp which finishes up at a cafe with scenic views. The cafe has two menues a bushtucker menue and a plain boring one for those unwilling to try new things. Danny opts for the kangeroo shepperds pie and Angie opts for the emu with rice native herbs and mango sauce. They where big for $12 and delicious.

Danny and Angie head back to Halls Gap. They stop for an ice cream. Angie - honey and nougutt in a cup and Danny - vanilla and butterscott in a homemade waffle cone. They return to the hotel at the end of the day and Danny retunes the tv five times in a matter of minutes because it has a mind of it's own."

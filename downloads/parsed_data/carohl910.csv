"event","so i haven't posted in forever...but i feel like ranting.  i'm pissed.  i'm angry.  and i don't really think anybody still reads this anyway so it doesn't matter if i go off.

some people just don't know when to stop.  they incessently make snide, offensive little comments just to see if they can get a reaction out of me because they know what they're saying makes me angry.  but it's not the nature and the purpose of the comments that angers me the most...it's the subject matter.  i'm so sick of people in college who claim to be my ""friends"" making these witty remarks about my religious beliefs.  insult my political ideology, my clothes, my music, my car, or whatever...that kind of stuff is annoying but you get over that kind of thing.  but going out of your way to ridicule things that are fundamental to who i am, to how i define myself, to how i think and perceive the world...that is uncalled for.  it's not like i go around trying to shove my beliefs down people's throats; to the contrary i'm usually pretty private about it unless i'm asked or i'm in a dicussion where theology comes up.  i don't go around badmouthing other people's religious beliefs...that's something that is usually unacceptable in the course of normal conversation.  i may not agree with what everyone else thinks about religion, but even if i (rarely) state my disagreement i DON'T make remarks that are intentionally insulting or derrogatory about religion.  

some people have such a snotty, elitist, condescending attitude towards people of faith it makes me sick.  and usually these are the people that are the ones advocating tolerance of ""everyone"", no matter what is different about them.  

tolerance...i hate that word.  not that i want to be intolerant or prejudiced.  the word tolerance implies that you are just putting up with people who are different out of some kind of obligation.  if you ""tolerate"" something, you're trying to just brush it off or ignore it instead of examining it for what it really is.  some people i know who would be classified as very ""tolerant"" are also some of the most judgmental people i know.  

and acceptance?  what does this mean?  are we supposed to accept people for who they are, flaws and all?  are we supposed to pretend we agree with all of their positions on issues to make them feel accepted?  do we have to flip flop on personal stances to be accomodating and politically correct?  i don't like the implications of the word acceptance either...

in truth, friends and neighbors should just love each other.  regardless of political affiliation, religion, race, or whatever.  if you are going to associate yourself with someone, don't go out of your way to try to pick at each other and pull at the threads of a person's psyche.  disagreements are inevitable for sure, but mean spirited verbal harpoons are unnecessary.  you should love.  and to truly love your friends and neighbors you have to remember that love is blindness."

"event","so it's been a good while since the last update.  i should update more, its not like there's much else going on...

classes this semester are going pretty well. easier than last semester which is nice, but the easier classes mean that i am not taking them seriously which equals a bad grade on that stats test that i just took.  man i should have aced it but after not paying attention in class for the past three weeks and not studying i wasn't really with the program.  i'll just have to study from now on.

i dropped spanish 1 million at the beginning of this month...the professor was a crazy grade deflating man who wrote our textbook.  i'll take it with someone easier maybe later.

i also declared a major this week...i am majoring in history probably with a minor in religion.  i only need 18 more hours for the history major so that shouldn't be too hard.  

i feel like i waste way too much of my time.  i'm the kind of person who likes to always be busy and involved in things but this semester especially, i don't really do anything other than go to class or sit around in the dorm.  i've been really antisocial lately too but whatever.  i guess i'll just have to join a bunch of clubs or something like that in the fall.  maybe i'll even get a job next fall. whoa!

i'm trying to figure out what i'm going to do this summer.  i've applied for an internship with senator burr's office in washington but i don't know if i'll get it or if i really want to do it.  i guess its something to do at least.  

i also really need to rediscover or revitalize my faith.  i go along and i know pretty much what the deal is but alot of what i felt really strongly about this summer after key west has really faded and become just an nice memory occupying the back of my mind.  i need some fellowship and maybe a good mission trip...unfortuneately, it doesn't seem like either of those will be made availible to me in the near future.  

thats about all for now though...i'm going to go outside"

"event","yeah so a lot's gone on since my last entry...some good stuff and some not so good.  but tonight i'm in a particular pissed off mood so i'm going to start by warning that i'm going to write angry and complaining things.  

i know it seems so lame and self-centered but i'm going to say it anyway...why does all this bad crap happen to me?!  i am sick like always...i can't seem to get through a week without having something wrong with me whether it be my back acting up, headaches, sinus problems, freaky stomach problems, weird rashes, or any number of other things.  and i'm really not a hypochondriac i promise.  i'm getting really out of shape even though i go to the gym obsessively and eat fruit all the time...what is my deal?

i'm tired all the time.  even when i get ""enough"" sleep i'm still tired.  and what is up with drunk people busting in my room at 2:30AM on a wednesday night/thursday morning.  what is up with my roommate and her friend downing everclear in the room and staying out until 4:30AM the same night?  sometimes it makes me sad that so many young people think that the only way to socialize and have fun is to drink...not to be social drinkers but to get wasted.  it doesn't surprise me...i knew it to be truth...it just makes me really sad for people sometimes.  yeah i know i'm not perfect and i've done things i regret...but i don't have to get my BAC outrageously high to have a good time...i wish there were other things to do around here

finals are going to chew me up and spit me out.  ahhhh!!

i don't get excited about things anymore.  everything just seems to go by in a boring, emotionless blur and i hate that.  i want to FEEL things again...be it joy or even pain...i just want to feel alive again.  i feel like i've wasted the past 3 and a half months of my life by not living.  normal everyday things don't satisfy me anymore...it's like i want something more but i don't know what or why.  i need to be with people who understand my motivations and the way my mind works...unfortunately those people are few and far between, especially here. 

i've been getting all these weird coincedental(or not) hints as to what i'm supposed to be doing with myself, but i don't know if i'm ready to commit to what i know to be true.  last week, i got a package in the mail from duke's graduate school...even though i didn't ask for it.  and also a couple weeks ago i got randomly asked by an old friend about some stuff and we had a long conversation about it.  and then just last night, this person from a YWAM base called me and asked me if i was interested in doing a DTS...whoa.  

i'm ready to be home...for a solid month with no work to even consider or think about.  i am wishing that i could just go...not to home or to school but somewhere where i can be me and where i can figure things out myself without distractions.    

i'm going to the gym...goodbye"

What do you hate? it annoys me when people are rude, disrepectful, or fake...i hate reading medieval spanish sonnets...i HATE math...it makes me sad/mad when people do scandalous things that are not good for them...it annoys me when people lie or are hypocritical but i can't really hate on people that do that because we are all hypocrites to some extent.

. What do you love? i love to make people happy...i love helping people...i love good music...i love it when i don't have a crapload of schoolwork...i love having good conversations with people...i love snowboarding because it makes me feel alive...i love it when i feel at peace with the world


yeah so...what up.  i'm going to wilmington friday night/saturday.  then i may be in greenville on saturday night/sunday.  then i'll be home like 2 days later for thanksgiving break...YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!"

i am really confused about this whole college deal.  i don't really feel like this is the right place for me, but i don't know where else i would go instead.  i also can't figure out if i want to graduate early or not...because i'm an academic sophomore so i'm allowed to graduate in 3 years if i wanted to.  so then i would have to declare a major THIS march?!  i don't know if i want to do that...i mean i don't really want to stay here for 4 years and it would save a whole lot of money but then it would be weird because you're supposed to enjoy college and whatnot and i feel like i'm just rushing to try to get it over with.  what is going on?!   

this past summer, i felt so sure of what i was supposed to be doing with my life and now i'm just so messed up and lost.  the desire to resort back to old, bad habits is overwhelming sometimes.  i really just want to take some time off from school and from home and just go away somewhere for awhile to sort things out.  because being here isn't really doing me any good but being at home is just as unproductive and makes me nostalgic and sad.

fall break was pretty random but i had a lot of fun (other than the endoscopy).  i got to relive my days of mock trial dominance by helping out at the rose team's practice on thursday night since i'm a coach now hahaha.  then i went to ""the thon"" and then ham's with cool people fron ecu.  friday i registered to vote (republican of course), got my license changed, and got an endoscopy.  they had to stick me like 7 different times to get a freaking IV in, but once they hit me up with that demerol i was out.  i was drugged like all day, even when i went to homecoming.  saturday i chilled with my mommy and daddy, went to see elizabethtown with emilia, gwyn, and emily.  it was a pretty good movie.  i chilled at mallory's later that night and had some good times.  sunday i hit up church and youth group what what.  its soo weird going back to church and youth group now but i really miss them.  so yeah...i'm trying to find tickets to the third day concert on friday, going to see wake beat state on saturday, and stuff.  i'll probably go home or something in a couple of weeks.  and i finally convinced my mom to go to the rock and pick me up a ticket for the david crowder concert which is on a wednesday (nov. 2)...lots of driving but it will be worth it.  that's about it....yep"

"event","yeah so it's been a really long time since my last post and i really don't feel like doing a recap of everything thats happened since then...

i had an ok weekend...i got to hang out with some cool people and get away from the house, which was really good.  we had science olympiad too and did surprisingly well in that.

i'm still waiting to hear back from everywhere i applied to school, but i am pretty sure that i am not going to be the recipient of any scholarships.  this fact is really depressing and really pisses me off, because it basically means that all the hard work and busting my butt and doing things that i really didn't want to for the past four years have been a complete waste of my time.  i have wanted the benjamin n. duke scholarship to duke since i was a freshman, but i didn't even get interviewed or anything for it.  so basically i have failed to achieve any goals that i set for myself. there are so many losers who in my class who are less qualified than me who are getting lots of scholarship money, and it pisses me off.  it makes me feel really stupid.  for example, the only reason i went to governor's school last summer was that i hoped it would help me get some scholarship money, but apparently it didn't and i wasted 6 weeks.  watch me not even get in to anywhere that i would want to go to college.

i've been really depressed for the past couple of weeks and i'm not really sure why.  i really need to get the hell out of this house...i'm so tired of living here it's not even funny.  i can't wait until i don't have people up my butt all the time about everything.  i've been trying to pretend that everything's all nice and happy, but it's all a bunch of fakeness.  i'm not happy, i feel stupid and useless, and i don't want to be here anymore.  i don't care at all about any of my school classes.  i mean, i already got denied any scholarships so whats the point of trying to appear smart anymore.  i hate rejection, and i hate working hard and not seeing any benefits.  i hate feeling inadequate, but i feel that way all the time.  

i really just need some space from certain people...especially the family and maybe the church crowd.  whatever...."

i went on the ski trip and that was really sweet.  i got to snowboard and hit up a lot of the black diamonds.  i also tried to help some of the beginner-type people...that didn't always work out well like when certain people ran into me and caused me brain damage.  the trip could be described in two phrases...""aesthetically pleasing landscape"" and/or ""lemme see your tush"" but that could be a bit scandalous.  i also got to hang out with all the cool underclassmen and jr. high kids...that was pretty interesting haha.

school lately has been pretty lame like always.  we've been having a lot of hardcore arguments in my government class about communism and socialism and wealth redistribution so that's been interesting, but the rest of my classes have been kind of boring.  especially ap enviro and spanish.  i really dont care about classes anymore...i have homework but i usually choose not to do it.  and i don't really study for tests either.  i'm so lazy.  oh well.  my parents ordered some of my cap and gown pics and our actual cap and gown orders come in on march 17th so after that i'll be even lazier.  sweet.

youth group last night was pretty cool.  we got to see the random videos that we made a couple weeks ago and then hear wayne talk about stuff.  he had some pretty good stuff to say too.  and i signed up to go on the mission trip to key west.  holler!

i still have a freaking sinus infection.  i guess that antibiotic cycle that i had been taking didn't kick the bacteria because i'm having the sinus pressure problems again.  i love feeling like i have a brick in my head all the time.

there is now a prank war going on between myself and the mock trial Boss lady.  i should probably find myself some allies since she apparently has her entire 1st period class, plus other people plotting against me.  today in psychology, i saw a picture of me dancing on mr. callahan's bulletin board.  unfortunately for her, it wasn't really embarassing...if a black and white little photo is the best she can do, she's losing her touch.  but like i said, the more intense her pranks get, the more revenge she's earning herself, especially after i graduate.

i have really gotten back into playing the guitar a lot lately.  i hadn't been really practicing a lot for a few months but the past couple of weeks i've really been playing a lot more.  it helps me release stress and such.  i've also become an obsessive listener of the red hot chili peppers.  i have like 3 of their CDs and i am addicted.  i wish they would tour sometime soon in the vicinity of NC so i could see them.

i should really study for my psych test or something though so i'm gonna go...adios"

"event","so this has been a pretty good week, except for watching duke suck at basketball.  i've had lots of opportunities for good quality time with both my friends from school and from youth group.  i have to learn how to balance time with those two groups of people.  

i'm also still trying to ""turn over a new leaf"".  i have made progress, and i think one of the next things i need to do is watch my mouth, cause i have a tendency to say stupid stuff, especially when i get pissed off.  there are definitely some forseeable temptations in the future, however i will hopefully be able to avoid them or excercise some self-control.

it's kind of depressing how like almost everyone knows where they're going to college already, and i don't hear anything from anyone until late march or april.  and UNC freaking lost part of my application so i have to re-submit some of it and see if smith ever mailed my letter.  i also got a postcard in the mail today from Yale saying that they hadn't recieved my recommendation from both teachers, which means that smith hasn't sent it there either.  i need to have a little chat with him regarding punctuality, and the neccessity of timely reccommendations in the college admissions process.  maybe he's just trying to sabotage my applications so i'll go to duke instead or something.  whatever.

last night at SALT chuck informed us that we will probably be going to YWAM Orlando this summer for our missions stuff, which is cool with me because that's what i voted for.  it was a kind of spur of the moment, impulsive vote that i made when chuck randomly called me, so hopefully that's really where we're supposed to be this summer.  i need to figure out when and where i'm traveling with different groups of people so i can figure out if i will have time to get a job like my parents wanted me to.

first, the most important news that has happened since the last update is that the rose mock trial team is now the official state champion.  we beat asheboro again!! hahahaha!  and i think that there is a general consensus that my cross examinations are the scariest out of any attorney in the state.  so now we have until april 1 off...then we get our completely new case and get to prepare everything in a month so we can go to the national competition in may.  sweet.

i've been going to viquest to work out a lot lately...fun

lets see...this past week has been quite interesting in dealing with certain issues.  i thought that as of monday, my life would have been officially over but that whole thing went ok i guess.  sorry for speaking in code, i'll tell everyone what the issues are eventually...but right now is not a good time to be advertising it.  i do think that i have made some important realizations/decisions lately and now its time to act upon those and set things straight.  thanks to my friend who has been helping me through all of this, even if i tell you to get out of my face or to back off sometimes.

school is so lame right now, i'm soooooo apathetic about all my classes.  for real, i don't care about doing any of my work right now.  it doesn't help that we've already taken cap and gown pictures with the fake diploma.  i really wish i could find out where i got in to college and if i got any scholarship $$ but i have to wait until like march or april to get any info on that.  too bad.

i am so ready to go snowboarding.  i am looking forward to the ski/snowboard trip in a few weeks.  and lately i have been enjoying youth group a whole lot more than i had been this year so thats cool.

if i could only get through this week at school, everything will be ok.

so i'm trying to leave behind a bad habit and i'm finding that this habit had consumed me more that i had ever realized.  when i wasn't doing this thing, i often found myself thinking about it and craving it and i suppose i still think about it more than i should.  so i guess its a good thing that i'm working on getting away from that now before it got worse, and while i'm still in town.

yeah but things are looking up.  last night was the first time i can remember being truly happy in months.  and there's no instant feel-good solution to all this stuff...it'll take a lot of work and time and tough decisions but at least i'm off to a positive start."

"event","so i've been thinking a lot lately about what the point is in me continuing to go to youth group activities and i'm not really sure what the benefits would be...

first of all, i'm really freaking busy all of the time and this whole being a uber-involved youth leadership type SALT person just isn't really fitting in to my schedule.  there are just many things that are more important than youth group going on right now.

another thing is, i don't really feel like i fit in at youth group now.  actually...i'm wondering if i have ever really fit in.  i mean, sure i've had friends in youth group and stuff, but i've never been one of the ""cool people"" that everyone likes to hang out with or whatever.  it's always seemed like if you're not in the band then you're not in the ""in crowd"" and if you're not really good friends with the ""in crowd"" then you get forgotten.  most of my good friends have graduated and gone off to college so now i'm a lonely high school senior.  it just doesn't seem like i really go together with a lot of those people, and most of them never call me anyway.

my friends from school remember that i exist and call me (sometimes) and so i'm with them more.  even so, i still spend many nights sitting at home on my butt like a dork.  

i really wish there were things going on this week where i could get away from the house for extended time periods because i'm really tired of spending the whole day with my family.  already....this is the freaking beginning of the break.  ahhhhhh!

the best thing going for me right now: Stats is over!!!!  even though i think i failed the final, i'm still happy that i never have to go see DR. S ever again.  yay!!!!

i'm so pissed off at my stats teacher and i will not be exempted from that gay exam.  she is such an unreasonable, bipolar freak.  thankfully, i only have to put up with her for a few more days since we get new classes next semester.

senior boards/project are over!  yay!  although this is awesome, this also means that i have engaged into full on slacker mode and am a victim of chronic senioritis.  i really don't feel motivated to like do anything in any of my classes right now.  what a shame...haha

i really should finish the rest of my college apps since the due dates are coming up soon.  i'm probably going to end up getting no scholarship $$ and that would suck but oh well...life goes on.  

for some random reason, i have really been missing some of my friends from governor's school lately.  i really want to go see some of them, but i don't know when that will happen unfortunately.  we should have a reunion of the intellegent republican people.  

i've been really kind of depressed lately too and i've been really tired of youth group and church and stuff.  i'm not like giving up on it or anything...i just kind of want a break.  and is trying to be hyper-involved in youth group really important anyway?  i mean i'll just be leaving soon so whoever the new youth minister will be really doesn't affect me...so yeah, whatever.  i'm ready to get out and go to college.  

so that's about it for now i suppose."

"event","yep so once again on a saturday night i am sitting alone on my butt in front of the computer....why is this happening so frequently?  well, there are a few possible explanations...
1. i have no friends
2. all my friends simultaneously forget to call me
3. nobody that has a cell phone answers it when i call them
4. everyone lost my phone number
5. my ""friends"" don't really want to see me

it could be a combination of these different options as well.  who knows.  i'm just so sick of sitting at home and spending ""family time"" and i need to get the freak out for at least a few hours. AHHH!!!!

i am also pretty sure that NOBODY ever reads my livejournal.  therefore, since nobody seems interested in reading it, i will stop posting forever unless people that read my journal actually post a comment and make it appear like my livejournal gets read.  post or else..."

"event","wow so it's been like a month since i last updated so here's whats been going down...

lets start with the most important news...george w. bush was re-elected!  YAY!!  the safety and sanity of the US has been assured for at least 4 more years.

i am also done with senior project except for senior boards...thank God!  the rest of school sucks, especially stats b/c i get kicked out for being a smart-ass.

we have been doing lots of mock trial.  regional competition was on saturday in wilmington and we won!!  we beat asheboro!  hahaha now that they've been de-throned, they're probably pissed and they're going to try to hire someone to assasinate me before state competition.  oh well i still got outstanding attorney awards in all three rounds.  we'll have to do a lot of work to be ready for states, because we ARE qualifying for nationals this year.  at least i have kori to be my bodyguard.

well that's about all...sorry i'm a pretty boring person.  and this entire update was inspired by my ""life-partner"" from GSE, Christa who threatened to leave me forever.  how sad."

"event","wow i'm totally slacking off with updating this thing...haha as if everyone wants to read my whiny writings about random crap.  so...........

school isn't that bad this year, but this week will suck to the max because all my teachers randomly decided to make everything due this week, the week that senior project hours are due.  how gay is that.  i can already tell that i will be very tired by friday when youth group goes on the fall retreat and i'll probably be mean and bite someone's head off in conversation and piss everyone off.  i'm predicting that i'll have a nervous breakdown on wednesday.

my mock trial advisor is spazzing out and trying to dump all this stuff on me too even though she freaking knows we have our SENIOR PROJECT hours due on THURSDAY!  and my parents are all on my case about college crap and scholarship crap....grrrrr.  

i'm still currently single...hahahaha.   yes i recently found out that the person who i took a liking to for quite a while is now ""talking"" to/dating some girl that i introduced him to.  :(  I thought it was a safe bet since she had been dating the same person for like 2 years....but then they broke up and she got all in friend's face and so now they go out or something.  wonderful.  isn't it ironic how life works??  maybe i really am supposed to be a freaking nun or something.

so that's about all that's going on at this time.  umm...yeah.  interesting...not!"

"event","1. Do you believe that a person can be a a strong christian and have major struggles? Explain.
  Yes i do.  Why?  Because i've experienced that before.  i think it is totally possible to have a strong meaningful relationship with God and still struggle with major issues and have problems dealing with major temptations.  the important part is that God forgives, God's grace is sufficient for us...and if you're willing to cooperate with Him then He'll help you get through those major struggles.  i know from personal experience.  i've had some major issues that i've worked through...and i still deal with hardcore temptations sometimes but God helps me through them.  woohoooo.
  
2. What do you think is the most essential emotion?
  i suppose that the most essential emotion is love.  because even though love can have many different forms, its essential.  and even though we can't acheive the most perfect form of love, its what we should strive for.

3. What is or has been your hardest problem to overcome?
  hmmm...that's a tough one...it's either ""that problem"" that i was dealing with for a while...and i'm sure the strawnapper knows what i'm talking about.  either that or some emotional issues stemming from my control freakishness/hardcore perfectionism.  i've had to learn not to spazz out and put an unneccessary amount of pressure on myself...which i still do sometimes.  but i'm getting better about it.  its just so hard to get rid of that mindset because i've been taught to think that way and accept only the best...thanks parents.  so yeah...i guess thats it

4. What are your thoughts on predestination?
   well...i do think that God has set out some sort of plan for everybody.  but then people's free will kind of affect and tweak the major plan.  so...i guess that people control what happens to them to like a certain extent, but then there are certain things that aren't up to us to control.

5. Who is the person that has most inspired you and why?
   hmmm...i can't really select one person that has truly inspired me more than others.  jesus?  haha.  well let's see...a person that i've actually met?  it depends on like what context.  i suppose our ex-youth minister steve was a pretty inspirational guy.  he made me want to work constantly to better myself as a person so i could then better the community and help the people around me.  and then i guess i've had some inspirational teachers and stuff like smith and salazar.  their classes inspired my obessive interest in biology and spanish.  they made me want to be the best student possible of those two subjects..  and there have been books and music that has inspired me but i can't really pick any one off the top of my head.  so yeah...i guess i must be an uninspired loser.

Bonus 6. Explain why your answer to #3 is what it 
i kind of explained the perfectionist answer...but ""that problem"" yeah.  it was hard to overcome and its still hard to avoid because for awhile, it became the way that i dealt with stress.  it was so easy to keep doing it after that first time.  and it was hard to stop it...i'm still tempted to do that again.  but i'm doing better.  and i'm sure that this answer is totally confusing for people that don't know what this is talking about so too bad for them."

"event","yes...that's right.  there were mexicans in my house today.  see my mom randomly decides that she wants our hardwood floors refinished and while she's at it, she wants to have our entire downstairs repainted.  what's up with that?  so anyway...our house has been all messed up and brain cell killing fumes have been around for like a week.  so this morning my mom randomly wakes me up and is all like ""i want you to come downstairs and figure out what these mexicans are saying cause they only speak spanish"".  hahahaha yeah right.    

so what's been going on lately?  well last week i had to spend most of my time at the grandparents house since we couldn't walk on our floors and the fumes were really freaking bad.  that was killer on the gas in my car....dang dang.  and this past weekend i went to go check out the davidson campus...it was surprisingly nice.  i can already tell that if i get in everywhere i apply, i'm going to have some major problems deciding where i'm going to college.  it might help if i knew what i wanted to do when i graduate from college...but i totally don't.  oh well.  at least i am pretty sure that i'm going to take 2nd semester of freshman year off since i'll have so many AP credits...so during that semester i'm gonna go and do a DTS (Discipleship Training School) through YWAM in some latin american country, most likely mexico somewhere.  maybe college's AP policies will help me decide where i'm supposed to go.  man when i end up filling out my DTS app. i'll have to get a pastor and a teacher and a ""friend"" to fill out recommendations and everything.  but i really can't think about even more recommendations or i might FREAK OUT since i already have all this college/scholarship junk to deal with.

man i am so ready to get out of this house and away from my immediate family.  i mean, they're nice people and everything and i appreciate all they do for me, but they're all up in my face all the time and they think they can just assume control of what i want to get out of life.  hello!!  i'm a senior in high school.  i can make my own freaking decisions!!  and i'm going to college and traveling abroad NEXT YEAR so you need to recognize this fact and leave me the freak alone.  don't try to shove your delusional visions for my future down my throat.  what you, the family, and what i want are completely different, and you're gonna have to get over it when i go my way.

so even though most of this post has sounded stressed out and/or angry, i'm actually in an overall good mood.  i'm doing well in all of my classes (at least i think i am) and i've really started to ""prioritize"" what's important.  this should be a really good year, aside from all the applications i have to file.  

so i need to go and do something more productive...yeah...later."

"event","1) Describe the time that you feel you've exerted the most self-control in your life.
 Hmmm....there have been lots of situations where self-control was necessary, but I suppose that the time when I've used the most self-control was while attending a scandalous party after being thouroughly depressed and stressed out, but managing to avoid falling back into ""that bad habit"".  I believe Mr. Buck and a couple other people know what ""that bad habit"" is so I'm not going to go into further explanation.

2) Do you feel love and hatred are actual emotions? explain.
 I think my answer to this one is both yes and no.  I think that you can feel lots of different kinds of love as an emotion...but i think that being ""in love"" with someone is also a state of being and there are acts of love.  you may wake up and feel pissed off at your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife but you still love them right?  The same with hate.  There are different types of emotions that would cause you to say ""I hate you/him/her/them""....but an actual lasting hatred is a state of being as well as an emotion...i think that both the state of hatred and that spur of the moment ""emotional hatred"" can both cause people to commit hateful acts. 

3) Have you ever hated anyone?
 Drawing from my answer to the last question...there have been stupid things that people have done to piss me off that have led me to say "" I hate whoever"" but those were just temporary feelings or superficial statements.  I've never had a lasting feeling of hatred for another person so long that it became a state of being/mind for me.

4) Quote a song (secular) to describe what heaven means to you.
""And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am""
- Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls

yeah i know that's kind of random but that's the best i could come up with on such short notice....i guess it kind of means that i don't want to have to deal with all the lies and sterotypical BS that you put up with on earth.  i just want to bust through all that and get to the absolute truth and reasons for living.  and so once i get to heaven i suppose there will finally be genuine, real people and i'll be free to do whatever i want in my relationship with God.  or something like that.

 
5) Soren Kierkegaard once said ""Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God."" Explain that quotation.
  explain what i think of it?  i think that God desires to have a relationship that is that um...intimate with us.  and so through a genuine desire to know God...one can acheieve that ultimate level of intimacy with him, like that level of intimacy between people who love each other...and this level of intimacy with God can be reached via prayer or worship

Bonus 6) If yes to #3, who have you hated? If no, who's the closest you've ever come to feeling hatred for?
  I really can't recall any specific person who I've been close to hating or whatever.  There are plenty of people who have pissed me of hardcore.  Ok I just thought of someone...there was this chick at governor's school who had some very different opinions from mine...and everytime we discussed things in class and i tried to express my opinions, she'd freak out and like cuss me out.  and she also made inappropriate generalizations regarding the military by saying they were like heartless baby-killing bloodthirsty murderers.  i don't take that well coming from a military family...so i flipped out and we had ""words"".  i think that even though i didn't know her very well, she's probably who i've come closest to hating.  either her or just people in general who are ignorant, confrontational, stereotyping, snobs who think they're hot stuff cause their daddies make good money and therefore are not required to be productive or know anything.  wow that was a random tirade but at least its an answer.

"event","man i have really been slacking off with this thing here...

i have discovered that what i write in my journal apparently gets around to a lot of people...without my knowing it.  in the future, if something i write in your journal, moves, inspires, interests, bothers, or offends you enough that you go tell other people about it, the least you could do is like give me a heads up or leave some comment about any particular entries so i at least have some idea of who is reading and who is ""affected"" by my writing in this here journal thing.

so whats been going on lately?  still recovering from the wisdom teeth extraction...apparently my face is still swollen because i've been told that i look like i gained weight...ha that's great.  swelling needs to go away!!

this past week at school was really stressful since i had to make up so much from the week before.  my crazy stats teacher gave me a quiz on stuff i hadn't been there to learn with out any advance notice.  that's like a violation of the county rules or something...what a freak.

friday, the 10th was my b-day.  yay!  i got a sexy iPod and a guitar amp woohoo.  and then i went to the SALT meeting...that was interesting.  yesterday at video team, which now has lots of random people including myself, we made a weird movie.  i think a lot of people were dissatisfied with the way that went down though...if there's too many people and it's too crowded i'd be willing to step back and let the original members do it.  i enjoyed it but it wouldnt break my heart to leave either.

i've come to a lot of good realizations lately in regards to my spiritual life that i think will go a long way in helping me to prioritize things this year.  i can't let my attempts at actions and service and stuff that people can see and acknowledge get in the way of the reasons behind all of that.  i made kind of a ""recommittment"" for the way i'm going to live my life and for how i'm going to go about my relationship with God...i've gotta get more personal instead of just using that relationship only when it's convenient for me.  

so that's about all for now.  what a wonderful entry."

"event","although the entry for this used to contain a rant about some issues that bother me about youth group, my feelings and comments apparently offended/bothered some people.  sorry for excercising my 1st amendment rights people....

so if those comments about SALT were offensive forgive me please"

"event","yeah so i'm getting really lazy with updating this thing...what's up with that yo?

the past couple of days have been somewhat intersting...or at least as interesting as school days can get.  monday was pretty standard except for when i found out that i made an A on my stats test.  that was like a miracle from God himself. yesterday i went to school and then left early to go to the dentist and the oral surgeon for like 2 hours because on monday one of my back teeth randomly started hurting and it was weirdly discolored.  so i go chill at the dentist and it takes them two hours to tell me that my wisdom teeth are like growing sideways into the roots/nerves of my teeth that are already in my mouth and that i need them out asap.  my surgery was originally scheduled for the day before my birthday...eww...but i got it moved sooner to this coming wednesday.  that should be interesting.  my dentist told me that the narcotics that the oral surgeon is going to prescribe me is one of the most powerful painkillers that you can get without having an IV.  you can't operate machinery or sign important legal documents withing 24 hours of having taken them.  whoa...that's hardcore!!

so i go to school again today.  what a blast.  first my head feels like its about to split in half and then i'm falling asleep in spanish...i was trying so hard to keep my eyes open but it was totally not working.  i did find out that i'm one of 8 people that my school is going to interview in consideration of getting a morehead scholarship nomination. i have to interview for that on monday.  and i missed stats yesterday so today i go and i have no idea what anyone is talking about and since i'm one of the most intelligent people in that class, nobody else understood the stuff well enough to explain it to me and we have a quiz tomorrow.  great!!

although i have a permanent headache for the time being, i'm really looking forward to this weekend because i can go on the SALT retreat now!  yay!!!!  that should be a good time...interesting at least.  i'll just have to stock up on some motrin or something of that sort.   

ooh fun mock trial meeting tomorrow...i had to go see the Boss after school to give her my cross questions for our demo usage tomorrow.  hahaaha...

ok well that's about all that i can think of...later"

"event","today was really boring.  i woke up really late, ate lunch with the familia, and then sat at home and played weird video games and played guitar.  after dinner i went to masons house and watched the strangest movie of my entire life.  if anyone understands the movie ""Dune"" please explain it to me. 

yeah...so i didnt really do anything today cause certain nameless people said they would call me to go to the movies and hang out but they forgot about me so everyone else in that group went to the movies today.  thanks alot guys.  i feel so loved.  

i need to get to work on my preliminary morehead application so i can turn it in on monday and see if the faculty picks me to apply for the scholarship.  i should also study for my government test...hahaha

i love neil...the gimp pimp.  i'm glad that this journal entertains him so much."

"event","whoa so it's been awhile since the last update, i've been getting kind of lazy and/or busy but i'm updating the masses on my life story at the request of kathryn.  to simplify this process i will break it down and do a day-by-day recap...

last friday: went to school, came home, went to emilias house for a bit, went to holly's bday party and played mau(spelling?) the evilist card game ever and then i randomly met kathryn and mallory at sonic where we sat and discussed interesting issues.

saturday: sat inside and played computer games like a dork during the hurricane.  when it was over i went shopping for stuff and then to sonic then went to a surprise bday party for farkas. i then proceeded to go to sonic again with kathryn and mallory.

sunday: went to sunday school, listened to chuck talk about stuff, listened to him spazz when i told him i couldn't go on the SALT retreat since i need to be president and all, went to church and listened to certain people laugh the whole time for certain reasons. went home, found out that i may be able to go on the SALT retreat after all, went to viquest, then had a bday party for my brother.

monday: school, then to meet my sr. project mentor and hear him tell me that i will be doing reasearch for some NIH proposal that he's writing.  this will involve me doing mitral valve replacements in pig hearts.  

tuesday: school, then home and nothing eventful

wednesday: teenage republicans meeting(YAY!), school, mock trial meeting (YAY) where i had to give a ""speech"" as the captain and then talk to the Boss about team possibilities and stuff like that.  i am really excited about mock trial...yes, yes i know im a hopeless nerd.  scheming agaist eric is fun though hahaha

thursday: school, then home, then nothing happened although i did attempt to study for my stats test, and altogether hopeless endeavor

friday: school, home, dinner with family, then sonic hang out time with kathryn and mallory.  woohoo!  we continued our continuous discussions about certain issues that both piss me off and crack me up.  

so how is school going eh?  english is pretty easy except for all the sr. project junk that i have to do.  gov't is awesome and guidry is the man.  spanish is ok...you aren't allowed to speak english without permission.  i dont really mind though.  stats is horrible cause my teacher gets mad when we are confused or ask questions, talks crap about america and americans, and doesnt speak english well.

so thats about it...such an interesting life i lead"

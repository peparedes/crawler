"event","What am I doing up at this hour?
Well, given that I've slept over 3/4<sup>th</sup> of the last 24 hours, I'm not all that surprised. 

Why have I slept this many hours?
I have no clue!

Is this going to probably screw with my sleep schedule come tomorrow night when I have to worry about getting up for work on Monday?
Probably.

"event","I went to go get my new glasses today and while I was in Wal-mart (Yes, I got my glasses at Wal-mart..) someone decided to make my day! ::big smile:: 

I came out to my car to find a note underneath the windshield wiper. The note brought a huge smile across my face as I read it.. offering me anything I could possibly want (minus parts of the front end) off of a '71, 4-door Chevy Nova! <i>FOR FREE!!</i> The guy left his number and a quick note saying that he was in Wal-mart. 
I called him up nearly immediately and within a few minutes he and his wife had come outside to talk to me about their '71. Their 17yo son had taken it out and smashed up the frontend pretty badly. (Supposedly he ran into the side of a SUV and screwed up the Nova. ::shakes her head::) They don't have the time to do anything with it and they were just about ready to call a junkyard to have it hauled away! They saw me pull into the parking lot and decided to circle around the lot until they found my car. (They hadn't seen me get out of the car, so they had no idea who they were looking for.) 
I need to go take a look at it, but from what he says, the car is in amazing shape (except for the frontend), and I can have anything that I could possibly want off the car! (Including the shaved back doors!! ::purrs::)

What I'd love to do (although is v. unlikely to be able to happen) is to just bring her home (she does run still!), store her someplace, and piece her out once the weather gets nice. But, I'll take what I can get!

This makes for a v. happy girl!!"

"event","I may have very well have gotten the kick in the ass today that I've needed to take care of a couple of things. (Gods this isn't going to be easy!) Things to make My Life better. Things, that in the long run, will make <i>*me*</i> better. It's not something that I wanted to do, but I don't always get the choice when it comes to things that I have to do. None of us really do.

For some reason, I'm scared. I feel like all of my experiences have been stripped away from me, and I am raw again. I know that I've done a lot of things, but I feel like I am starting all over again. (I am in many respects.) But this is a feeling that I'm not really sure if I like, or can fully explain. I feel like I'm a lot more vulnerable to everything that can possibly hurt me. (It's not even a fully vulnerable - the good can still hurt.)

I need to look at this as a way to push forward. I've been trying to move myself forward for nearly a year now, and I feel like I haven't gotten anywhere. I very possibly haven't. It is always so much easier to continue moving ""forward"" by ways of inertia, instead of by effort. I need to put more effort into My Life!

We will see what unfolds over the next month and a half.."

"event","A Georgia Peach and cleaning off my car. I wasn't looking forward to the first drive in the snow with my baby, but she did fine. (Then again, it was only three blocks and I was doing 20mph!) BUT.. that doesn't change the fact that she's been driven in the snow! I still need to go out and put her into a skid and pull myself out of it. <small>(I know how to drive in the snow, but it's a different game completely while driving a rear-wheel drive car, as compared to the previous front-wheel drive cars that I've owned. Or so I'm told.)</small>

I feel like I am going to be fairly productive today. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to get done, but it feels like there is a lot of energy waiting in the wings. Just brimming under the surface, just waiting to be used. 

I also found myself expressing one of the things that has been bothering me slightly while on the phone this afternoon. It's nothing major, but it is something that does play into one of my decisions. (One of the big ones, at that!)

For now, I need to get lunch. Not entirely sure what I'm going to make/get, but, it should probably be soon.

"event","The first couple of days of the new year have been fairly ""quiet"". There has been a lot of time spent with friends, partying, and sleeping. But overall, it's been quiet. My mind hasn't been working on nearly the number of things that it normally does. I am not sure if that's because I'm giving it a rest, or it's giving me a rest. Either is a bit of a welcomed thing. There are a few things that have been weighing more on my mind than they have in the past, but I think for good reason (and in a good way). 

There are things that I need put my energy towards, and I think it's going to take a little bit of time, but I think that once I finally pull myself out of whatever little hole that I've been in for the past couple of months, I will be fine.

As usual, a little bit of time and energy.. and all will be well."

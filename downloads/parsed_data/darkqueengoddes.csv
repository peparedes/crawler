"event","ok, so this is my second entry and i just wanted to say to every one; ""Has everyone gone mad?! i mean, all these crazy relationshops (aka Jack the Ripper, etc). Also, i have to say that, i have no idea what the hell Cheslymar is talking about when she says - quote on quote ""Heath Story""!? Anyway, i also have to say that...i need some ideas for a new topic to talk about because this relationship one is getting old.
     Another thing i want to say is this, you know those juice bottles, that when you twist them off and look under them , they either say a fortune like ""Don't eat lobsters today"" or ""You'll come upon great wealth today"", or it will be a contest for a big plasma screen and no matter how many times you buy that kind of juice you know that you'll never have a top that says ""CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'VE WON THE PLASMA SCREEN"".... why can't all caps have things like that?"

"event","hmm....I wonder how safe this entry is from prying eyes? you know, i could past anythin here about my secret life and stalkers could come up and just snatch that info like it was candy from a baby. Then, i would go to bed at night and wake up and find out that someone was stalking me and, well there you have it, i'd be dead."

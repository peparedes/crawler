Since no one is ever writing in this thing..I figure I will carry the torch and continue. 

Another week closer to the end of the year...although the Monday after Spring semester ends..I have to take a Maymester class. Statistics are gonna be no fun! And get this..I have to take my Stat final ON MY 21st BIRTHDAY!! How much does that suck?? This week went really well. A friend of mine came back to M-ville after a semester's absence..I have been winked at twice this week..I did much better than I expected on two assignments..and I bought 2 cool shirts that came in the mail today! It's the little things..right? 

I was supposed to go home this weekend to meet my first Wish Child for Make-A-Wish, but she is in the hospital. That means we will have to postpone our meeting with her family. I think that I am going to a movie tonight with some of my fav people. The majority of my weekend will be spent writing play #2, and starting my creative non-fiction piece. Joy..

I hope that all of you are doing well! 

Life is great!

"event","Holy crap it's been a long time since I updated this stupid thing. I don't think that anyone writes in these livejournals anymore anyway. 

All I wanted to write was that I have been happy for the past week. I haven't felt happy in awhile..and it took a lot for me to notice it. I am better off now..and I'm free to do as I choose. It feels like this enormous weight has been lifted off my shoulders..and it feels great. I now see so many opportunities..when before there didn't seem to be many. I felt as if my choices in life had been limited..and now they seem boundless. I am looking forward to all the things I have coming up..my first Wish for Make-A-Wish..Camp this summer (I'm at teen camp!)..possible internship opportunities...and getting closer with some new people I have gotten to know this week. It's kind of sad to think that graduation is coming up soon..and so many of my friends here are seniors. They are all moving on (mostly to other states) and I'm stuck here. Hey..that just means that I get to go to those other states to go visit them!! Yay! ROADTRIP! I hope that all of you are doing well (those of you who still read this darn thing) and are as happy as I am now.

SMILE!"

"event","Well..its been awhile since I updated this thingy..so here goes!

Christmas break was great..nice to have the time off. Fall semester really took its toll on me..but I managed to get better grades than I thought..2 A's and 3 B's..not too shabby if you ask me! Zach and I celebrated our 6 month anniversary on Dec. 21. He took me ice skating!!! I had never been before and it was sooo much fun! For Christmas I got a digital camera..its sooo much fun to play with. I also got a Disney version of the board game Sorry from the twins! From Zach, I got two t-shirts, some nice perfume, a necklace and earrings, and a Sleeping Beauty watch! I got a few other things which were great too. 

I am excited to get back to work in the Spring..I have some great classes lined up. I'm taking Police Systems, Corrections, Intro to Creative Writing, American Lit, and Political Parties and Elections. Also, I go back to work on Tuesday at Housing. I have missed Miss Jenny, so I can't wait to see her! Other than that, not too much is going on. I have applied to be a counselor (permenately) at Camp Sunshine..which I'm worried about because they only have a limited number of spots available..I am hoping and praying that I get one of them. I miss that place..and the kids. That organization is so close to my heart, and I feel like it is my purpose in life to give back in such a way. So..wish me luck..I should find out in the next 3 months or so. I hope everyone is doing well..and I wish all of you love this new year! ALIAS STARTS ON WEDNESDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

HAPPY 2005!!!  :-)"

let's see..what shall i comment on..last week was great..go sox!!!! we are so gonna win the world series..get to watch the games all this week..speaking of the sox..my new icon is kinda cute..i hate ben afleck..but he likes the sox..so i guess he's ok..and they do look cute together..i will have to see if i like this..but i still love jennifer garner..she kicks booty!

this week is gonna be weird..i have nothing that i really have to do for hw..so naturally, this would be a great time to work on my multiple papers..the problem is that i'm not nearly motivated enough to work on them..oh well..

im in talks with this woman who i found through these caringbridge.com web sites (the same type of site as carter's) and she is starting her own organization for childhood cancer awareness..and i really want to help..bad..so i emailed her and she wants to sit down and talk about me helping her out..im excited..i feel like this is what im supposed to do with my life..help out this cause..im very passionate about it now..camp sunshine triggered that..but to me..one week a year is not nearly enough..im not satisfied..so i hope this is the right path..or will lead to it..
also..i was talking to abby (a girl i work with) and she told me that there was a class available here to take and become a substitute teacher..which i think is really neat..so i might look into that..because if im going to devote a lot of time to helping out cancer organiaztions..i dont know how much that will pay..if anything at all..so i need an income..and substitute teaching might be a cool way to do that..i can work on and off..and still be able to devote time to the cause that is so close to my heart..i dunno..these are just options that have arisen in the past week..so nothing is for sure..and wont be for awhile..

that's all i have for now..love to all

I decided to go home to PTC on Thursday night to get some winter/cool weather clothes (and now its warm again..grr)..then I went on to Zach's house so we could see eachother for an extra night. Friday..Zach and I hung out most of the day..and then went to his friend Morgan's birthday at the bowling alley..I wasn't feeling too well so I took turns with Bethany (Zach's friend Matt's girlfriend)..Saturday..me, Zach, and his parents went up to Helen to Oktoberfest (yes..its spelled like that)..the weather was beautiful..but it was crowded..and there wasn't much to do except see the shops..so we left..but I did get a candy apple!! yum yum..Sunday..I was not in a good mood for reasons I will not go into..but we went to Six Flags for this cancer survivors/off-therepy day..so the tickets were free..but it was crowded so we couldn't really ride all the rides we wanted too..then my drive home was not a good one..was very upset and sad..won't go into why..but I really wanted my mommy..I wanted to talk to her so she could make it all better..but I can't talk to her..she cant tell me it's going to be alright..so I got bummed..I haven't been bummed in a LONG time..not like that..so that was odd..but I'm ok now..I think I'm too busy to be bummed..if that makes sense..anyways..got a long week ahead of me..as do most of you..so love to all.."

"event","I have not really been able to express my feelings lately..and I don't think that these particular emotions can ever be expressed adequately..but here's my best attempt at it..

I know that in the grand scheme of things..I barely knew the kid..but Carter Martin touched my life more than I ever thought he could..I can not explain it..I guess you just have to know Carter..and it's not just Carter..it's his incredible family (Leigh Anne, Scott, and big bro Candler). These people just have a way of making you feel like you belong with them..you are instantly their friends and they offer you everything..leaving you to feel as if you owe them the same in return..and feeling the warmth of exceptance..and the presence of something great..not often felt on this earth..

Carter..though I only knew you a very short time..that was all I needed..at Camp I learned about this quiet natured boy with the ""special"" leg and helmet from Zach..I remember him telling me about him the day our kids arrived at Camp..and then the boating incident..I quickly learned that this ""quiet"" boy was anything but that! I remember Carter pouring water down Zach's shirt and yelling ""get 'em!"" at us girls..and yes..he did get us good..I was soaked from head to toe! I remember Carter in the pool..swimming all over the place and climbing all over poor Zach..I remember a kid who had so much enthusiasm and strength..I remember Carter dunking me 3 times in the dunking booth..and when it was Zach's turn to sit in the booth and Carter came up to throw the ball at the target..I remember everyone yelling ""CARTER..CARTER..CARTER!""..I remember that grin..and that laugh..but it wasn't until after Camp that Zach told me that Carter was going to have it rough..he was having back pain which we found out later was due to new tumors growing in his little body..they said his chances weren't that great..I guess that's when it hit me..you see..I have never really experienced children with cancer until Camp..when I went through my treatment..I only saw adults..but it wasn't until meeting all these beautiful children fighting the same big, bad monster I fought, did I really understand what pediatric cancer really meant..a lot of these beautiful, smiling faces weren't going to live to grow up..although most will..but too many won't..and Carter did not make it..although he fought the good fight..but cancer did not win in this instance..Carter won because he did more with his 7 years, 9 months and 12 days than many can ever hope to do in an average lifetime..this boy has touched thousands because of his enormous faith in God..and his love for life on this earth..he did not take one day for granted..and appreciated everything small and insignificant..he was just a boy..but this boy touched my heart..and countless others..and we all miss him terribly..but now we all have this special angel named Carter who will watch over us until we see him again in that ""glorious place"" as he put it so adequately..I feel like I have not done this child justice..but I tired my best..even if most of what I have written has been just jumbled thoughts and memories..its what I feel right now..I guess I just hurt..and I miss that boy..I wish I got to know him better than I did..but I guess I should feel honored to know him at all..because so many won't get that priveledge..Carter, we love you little buddy..and I promise to try to live up to your example..I wll try my hardest not to let you down..catch ya later Cartmander!"

"event","well..I'm at work and I have nothing to do except hw..but I guess that's a good thing..I had a good LONG weekend..let's recap..
Thursday: I got out of class at noonish..and then left for panama city at about 3:30 with Zach
Friday: enjoyed perfect weather at the beach and went to the pool..got a little burnt..then went out to eat..and then to see a movie..saw Paparazi (spelling?) and it was good..then went to play putt-putt with Zach..and I beat him (sorry baby..hehe)
Saturday: experienced even better weather than Friday..went to the pool first..then the beach..but Zach got stung by a jellyfish or some unknown creature..so that wasn't good..but then we went out to eat..and then went to Miracle Strip..it was too crowded and Zach and I were not feeling to great..so we left after riding the Log Floom and the Ferris Wheel..so we decided to go walking on the beach at about 9ish..we talked and sat there..it was really nice..I love the beach at night..its one of my favorite things..and the stars were so beautiful..it made me feel a lot better
Sunday: we woke up and packed up our stuff..then we went to the Pier and the water was sooo blue! we just wanted to see the water before we left..and neither one of us had ever been on the Pier..so that was fun..then we got in the car and drove back to Milledgeville..the weather actually got worse the farther north we went! we got back at about 6ish..then Zach and I went out to eat at Applebee's..it was good
Monday: stayed in bed ALL day! me and zach watched the CSI marathon on spike tv..i got him hooked on the show..haha! then he had to leave..and then I was sad (I still am)..
Tuesday: classes were cancelled thanks to hurricane francis..wahoo!! so I just stayed in and did some hw..and was bored to tears all day..

today..went to class and now I'm back to my old routine..

i miss you baby...and I love you so much..please hurry back to me.."

"event","I have not been able to put my feelings into words for most of the evening..or at least since I read Carter's web-page and discovered news that shattered my world..sweet little Carter will no longer receive chemo, radiation, or scans of any kind..for now on he will only be on pain medication..and he will spend ""uninterrupted"" time with his family..and don't they ever deserve these precious days..

The first thing that went through my mind as I read the web-page was horror..then anger..a burning anger that then caused tears to fall from my eyes..what I was I angry about? well..I was angry that God chose to save someone like me..and not a sweet boy who deserves a fair chance at life more than I ever will..then I got angry at myself for giving up on Carter..I know that he will hold on for as long as he can..this little boy doesn't back down from a challenge..he is too stubborn..he loves life too much..he is too effervescent..he is everything that we should all strive to be..but why is he more deserving at life than I am..why does he deserve a miracle more than I did? well..when I was diagnosed..I cursed God..I blamed him..I thought he was punishing me..I hated him..I lost my faith..I now have my faith back..but Carter and his family's faith has NEVER faultered..they have never expressed anger towards God..they are faithful even now..they continue to pray for a miracle and they have left everything up to God..that is an amazing testiment to faith..and I fear that I will never have as much faith as that little boy and his family do..Carter will even be baptized this Sunday..I wish I could see him..that would be a sight to see..

I ask that everyone please pray for sweet Carter..he needs a miracle.."

im in the process of quitting soccer..it has been the source of a lot of drama in the past 3 weeks or so..its just so hard to break ties with coaches like robert and michelle..and to leave behind something i never thought i would have the ability to do again..its difficult to explain why its so hard..but in a week it should be done..i have no choice..its just not do-able..i have school..work..and i need time to myself to do whatever i want to do..i just dont have time in my life to make soccer a priority..

"event","So once again I had a wonderful weekend with Zach! On Friday we babysat Carter and his older brother Candler..let's just say Carter is the easy one to look after! We insisted on not being paid..but his mom is just too sweet and threatened that we couldn't come back if we didn't accept the money..when Zach finally counted it out when we got home..we found out it was $80!! All I can say is that I was sick to my stomache..because I don't feel like I should be paid for spending time with the sweetest little boy..I wanted to do it and I know Zach did too..but we have decided to use that money to buy more gifts for Carter..things that we couldn't afford to buy him ourselves! On Saturday..we went to the pool..and I got some sun..which is great since I am pastey white! After that, Zach took me to my surprise..which was seeing ""The Music Man"" in the park in Ackworth..it was a great play..although..as Zach said to me..the acting could have been better..on Sunday we went to church..and it was great..their pastor is wonderful to listen to! Then we went to lunch at Steak and Shake! After that we went to the mall and I got a new purse!!! Also, Zach bought me this cute sign to go on my door..either in the apartment or in my room at his house..I also got some picture frames and a photo album for my camp pictures..so it was a jam packed weekend..looking forward to next weekend!! All I have to say is that I have the best boyfriend on the face of the earth and I love him SO SO much!!!"

I met Zach at Camp Sunshine..on our first night there..I knew I liked him..he was so sweet to everyone..and he just seemed so happy..and he showed me a lot of attention..which made me wonder if he liked me..but I assumed that a guy like that wouldn't be interested in me..and he is so hot! The next day he said he wanted to know if I was interested in going to a Braves game with him and some people after camp..I was thrilled and said that I'd love to..then I had even more hopes for something between us..but I remained unsure..afraid that I was imagining something more..we continued to do just about everything together because our cabins were paired for everything..and our meal tables were next to eachother..the boys in his cabin even called us ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" before anything happened..by Monday night..at the carnaval..we were dating..we continued to spend as much time together as we could..even spending rest periods and evenings together..then by the end of camp..we knew that there was no point in dating because we knew so much about eachother..so we were boyfriend and girlfriend..and I knew that I had deeper feelings for him then I could have ever imagined..some people might think I'm crazy..but I fell in love with him after a week..and the crazy thing is that he loves me too! Imagine that!! Even though we have only been together a month..it feels like much longer..and I have never said this to anyone but him (for fear of being called ""crazy"") but I'm convinced that there is no one else for me..I love him and want to be with him for the rest of my life..so I said it..think what you want..but we love eachother and I am the luckiest girl on the face of the earth..I have the love of a wonderful gentleman..who makes me feel beautiful..smart..and special..he makes me feel complete and whole..part of me is missing when I'm away from him..but now I have to end this to get ready to go to dinner with him to celebrate our anniversary..I love him..and I'm sorry that I didn't do you justice sooner baby..I'm sorry..I love you so much and miss you.."

It is not fair..now I feel guilty for being successful with my treatment..I would rather trade places with Carter..let him take my place so he can live more of his life..he doesn't deserve this pain..or this illness..I ask that anyone who reads this will pray for this sweet boy..he needs all the help we can give him..if you don't pray..please think good thoughts for him..Please spare this child Lord..let him live..give him a miracle.."

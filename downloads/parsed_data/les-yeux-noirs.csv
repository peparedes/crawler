"event","sometimes we get overzealous in our spring cleaning, and we throw out a bunch of old shit we'll eventually miss. other times, we misplace a bunch of shit that means a lot to us and we can never find it again. sometimes it's hard to tell whether you lost your shit or whether your shit lost you, and sometimes you can't tell if that shit even belonged to you in the first place. 
i guess, in the end, we need to look at things for what they are: gone, and shit."

"event","-When studying personality types and their impact on policy, scholars examine a leader's basic orientations toward self and toward others, behavioral patterns, and attitudes towards about such politically relevant concepts as authority. There are numerous categorization schemes. The most well known of these places political personality along an active-passive scale and a positive-negative scale. Active leaders are policy innovators; passive leaders are reactors. Positive personalities have egos strong enough to enjoy (or at least accept) the contentious political environment; negative personalities are apt to feel burdened, even abused by political criticism. Many scholars favor active-positive presidents, but all four types have drawbacks. Activists, for example, may feel compelled to solve every problem even though not doing anything might be preferable. That was true in some cases for President Clinton, whom most political psychology studies categorized as an extremely activist personality, and who himself admitted to being ""almost compulsively overactive.""-

-Whatever the best combination may be, there is wider agreement that the worst is active-negative. The more active a leader, the more criticism he or she encounters. Rather than taking criticism in stride, though, the leader assumes that opponents are enemies and may withdraw into an inner circle of subordinates who are supportive and give an unreal view of events and domestic and international opinion. Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin and, to a lesser degree, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were all active-negative personalities who showed symptoms of delusion, struck out at their enemies, and generally developed bunker mentalities.-

It's a little sad when political scholars use political criminals to illustrate the particular political personality type you possess. I'm going to go build my bunker."

the paint on the door is chipped.<br>

we shoot at the door and it crumbles, revealing another red door, with bullet holes. they bleed.<br>

i see the man who had been walking down the street begin to run to the pay phone next to my body.<br>
he's going to call the police and tell them i killed myself. i run after him.<br>
he sees me running and runs a few yards away from the phone.<br>
i pick up the dangling phone and all i hear is a constant dial tone.
uninterrupted, nothing happens when i press the buttons or the lever.<br>
i scream and my face turns scarlet. my lungs throb and my voice cracks. tears stream down my face, and...<br>
<br>
the phone next to my pillow rings and awakens me. i pick it up and the
person on the other line sounds confused. they have an accent and i
hang up the phone. 
i turn it off.<br>"

so i called seamus and everything was fine. it turns out he was an hour late too.
then i picked up bagels, and let me tell you, pulling a left turn onto rt.202 from the country deli at rush hour is some scary squirrely shit.
so, a few hours later i was making a bagel for this cute little munchkin, and i accidentally sliced my ring finger in half. i cleaned the knife off, and then got james to make the bagel since i was all monty python, and everything was ok again. 
james told me to sit down at the desk in the back and keep my hand elevated, and he went out to help more customers.
a felt a little woozy, but then i was listening to the music (i am the egg man) and i felt better. 
the next thing i know, i'm laying on the floor, at the foot of the desk, and james is asking me if i'm all right. i tell him i'm great, and he leaves. i look at my foot, which is the only thing left on the chair, and i think that it was a great idea to raise my feet, since this prevents fainting.. 
finally, after i stare at the file cabinet an inch from my head on the right, and the dustballs under the desk on left do i realize that yes, i've fainted. after a few giggles i get up and wipe the blood that's collected on the floor during my departure and i realize i feel like i'm on cloud 9. fainting is mucho underrated. laura came in a minute later and gave me a drop of this liquor stuff and she put neosporin on my finger. 
a few other icky things happened, like getting two parking tickets from those skanky po-lice and talking to a really sad little one who wanted her mum on the phone. 

i left an hour later, and the only negative thing i can think of is my head and neck hurting pretty bad. (i can't feel the appendage) 
the weird thing is: i haven't felt this good in weeks."

"event","i saw three beautiful people last week.

no more, and no less.

e'hm.

the first person i saw was at westchester. 
i was walking along a path, and he was approaching me on my right.
he was probably the blackest black i've ever seen (most likely an african exchange student), and his eyes and teeth were pure white. i've never seen anyone so human and yet so ethereal at the same time. there is beauty in black.

the second person i saw was a woman i helped at work. 
she was old, maybe 70.
her skin was like soft crinkled paper and her eyes were muted.  
it's interesting how the beauty of young girls and women is often noted but the beauty of the elderly is overlooked. she was beautiful. like the boy, there was nothing attractive about her usual features, but something captivating about her skin, eyes, and teeth.

the third person i saw was a young girl standing on the side walk of a rundown area in peekskill. i caught a glimpse of her as i was driving by.
she was probably 6 or 7 years old.
she stood, with both hands holding a gallon jug of orange juice over her head, drinking in a way that reminded me of how a warrior would hold the heart of an enemy or prize catch above his head, triumphantly sinking his teeth into the flesh. it was glorious and modern and telling."

-the smell of falling asleep on a cot in my brothers ganja growing room. no dreams.
-a dream i had two days ago about playing a rodeo reality game in the dark against           
 trained cia operatives adorned with glow-sticks. 
-making a pact to tell the popo nothing with nicky and wade right before nicky and wade 
 confessed everything, right after i denied all that would later be confessed. 
 bastardos.
-bob marley and christmas lights. in october.
-3 different people banging on 3 different walls at our old apartment as andrew and   
 i wrestled ourselves to bruises, gouges, and exhaustion.

"event","oh goddess i thank thee. you who are my teacher and my first love. you welcomed me to your bosom at my birth.you who dances this world with me in your arms, and you who will gladly take me into your womb when this shell grows cold.

     you my one constant love. a love that does not fear and i need never fear for it is eternal. it is unquestioning and ever yielding. you who take all that i can give and never ask for more then this. i thank you for showing me this. i can but hope i learn the lesson so that all of those i love can feel the same of me.
      
      i think these thoughts as i gaze at your beauty. i stand in the night, watching the rain fall on myself and all around me.it makes me daydream of the sweat that drips from my body in the heat of passion to my lovers skin. the way our body's moisture mingles as we embrace after love play. then the chill of it enters my skin reminding me of when my lover or i must go back to life with the cold left from where their warmth once was.

      i turn to let the rain strike my face and feel the chill autumn wind. this turns my thoughts to your different moods and  temperament. how the first sweet, warm, wet spring breeze is like that first timid kiss. then the summers scorching breath, like passion so inflamed how can your skin not be forever burned( if only that burning was of only flesh).followed by the slow seeping chill of autumns touch that makes me remember what was,what might have been. lastly winters strangling cold so like that which is lost but can never be forgotten,that which you wish would leave you (but you fear that losing would be worse).

    i can but thank you for these pleasures and pains. for with them i am who i am. again i thank you for your love and your hope that even one of us your children well one day understand your love.



as i sit writing this does the storm strengthen and the thunder grows deeper i can but hope that the lady is saying she enjoys these my thoughts of her so mote it be .

one child that feel the the mothers love and shall face it not matter the cost to his heart. love to all, you know who you are.

I do not wonder when it shall leave me and let the fear drive it away as i would normallly, as if anything is normal in a world of people who can not hear the music of the spheres in thier lovers smile or a drop of rain.(in the background a song i love plays, it makes me cry to listen to it and i know not why or care which is the truth of beauty i think to just feel it, love it, and embrace it, not care why""there are places i have never been and worlds i have yet to dream my of.

Then said Almitra, ""Speak to us of Love."" 

And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. 

And with a great voice he said: 

When love beckons to you follow him, 

Though his ways are hard and steep. 

And when his wings enfold you yield to him, 

Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. 

And when he speaks to you believe in him, 

Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. 

For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning. 

Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, 

So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. 

Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself. 

He threshes you to make you naked. 

He sifts you to free you from your husks. 

He grinds you to whiteness. 

He kneads you until you are pliant; 

And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast. 

All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart. 

But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure, 

Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, 

Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. 

Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. 

Love possesses not nor would it be possessed; 

For love is sufficient unto love. 

When you love you should not say, ""God is in my heart,"" but rather, I am in the heart of God."" 

And think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course. 

Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself. 

But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: 

To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night. 

To know the pain of too much tenderness. 

To be wounded by your own understanding of love; 

And to bleed willingly and joyfully. 

To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving; 

To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy; 

To return home at eventide with gratitude; 

And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

Laughter and tears


As the Sun withdrew his rays from the garden, and the moon threw cushioned beams upon the flowers, I sat under the trees pondering upon the phenomena of the atmosphere, looking through the branches at the strewn stars which glittered like chips of silver upon a blue carpet; and I could hear from a distance the agitated murmur of the rivulet singing its way briskly into the valley. 

When the birds took shelter among the boughs, and the flowers folded their petals, and tremendous silence descended, I heard a rustle of feet though the grass. I took heed and saw a young couple approaching my arbor. The say under a tree where I could see them without being seen. 

After he looked about in every direction, I heard the young man saying, ""Sit by me, my beloved, and listen to my heart; smile, for your happiness is a symbol of our future; be merry, for the sparkling days rejoice with us. 

""My soul is warning me of the doubt in your heart, for doubt in love is a sin. ""Soon you will be the owner of this vast land, lighted by this beautiful moon; soon you will be the mistress of my palace, and all the servants and maids will obey your commands. 

""Smile, my beloved, like the gold smiles from my father's coffers. 

""My heart refuses to deny you its secret. Twelve months of comfort and travel await us; for a year we will spend my father's gold at the blue lakes of Switzerland, and viewing the edifices of Italy and Egypt, and resting under the Holy Cedars of Lebanon; you will meet the princesses who will envy you for your jewels and clothes. 

""All these things I will do for you; will you be satisfied?"" 

In a little while I saw them walking and stepping on flowers as the rich step upon the hearts of the poor. As they disappeared from my sight, I commenced to make comparison between love and money, and to analyze their position in the heart. 

Money! The source of insincere love; the spring of false light and fortune; the well of poisoned water; the desperation of old age! 

I was still wandering in the vast desert of contemplation when a forlorn and specter-like couple passed by me and sat on the grass; a young man and a young woman who had left their farming shacks in the nearby fields for this cool and solitary place. 

After a few moments of complete silence, I heard the following words uttered with sighs from weather-bitten lips, ""Shed not tears, my beloved; love that opens our eyes and enslaves our hearts can give us the blessing of patience. Be consoled in our delay our delay, for we have taken an oath and entered Love's shrine; for our love will ever grow in adversity; for it is in Love's name that we are suffering the obstacles of poverty and the sharpness of misery and the emptiness of separation. I shall attack these hardships until I triumph and place in your hands a strength that will help over all things to complete the journey of life. 

""Love - which is God - will consider our sighs and tears as incense burned at His altar and He will reward us with fortitude. Good-bye, my beloved; I must leave before the heartening moon vanishes."" 

A pure voice, combined of the consuming flame of love, and the hopeless bitterness of longing and the resolved sweetness of patience, said, ""Good-bye, my beloved."" 

They separated, and the elegy to their union was smothered by the wails of my crying heart. 

I looked upon slumbering Nature, and with deep reflection discovered the reality of a vast and infinite thing -- something no power could demand, influence acquire, nor riches purchase. Nor could it be effaced by the tears of time or deadened by sorrow; a thing which cannot be discovered by the blue lakes of Switzerland or the beautiful edifices of Italy. 

It is something that gathers strength with patience, grows despite obstacles, warms in winter, flourishes in spring, casts a breeze in summer, and bears fruit in autumn -- I found Love.
************************************************************************************
 Leave Me, My Blamer



Leave me, my blamer, 
For the sake of the love 
Which unites your soul with 
That of your beloved one; 
For the sake of that which 
Joins spirit with mothers 
Affection, and ties your 
Heart with filial love. Go, 
And leave me to my own 
Weeping heart. 


Let me sail in the ocean of 
My dreams; Wait until Tomorrow 
Comes, for tomorrow is free to 
Do with me as he wishes. Your 
Laying is naught but shadow 
That walks with the spirit to 
The tomb of abashment, and shows 
Heard the cold, solid earth. 


I have a little heart within me 
And I like to bring him out of 
His prison and carry him on the 
Palm of my hand to examine him 
In depth and extract his secret. 
Aim not your arrows at him, lest 
He takes fright and vanish 'ere he 
Pours the secrets blood as a 
Sacrifice at the altar of his 
Own faith, given him by Deity 
When he fashioned him of love and beauty. 


The sun is rising and the nightingale 
Is singing, and the myrtle is 
Breathing its fragrance into space. 
I want to free myself from the 
Quilted slumber of wrong. Do not 
Detain me, my blamer! 


Cavil me not by mention of the 
Lions of the forest or the 
Snakes of the valley, for 
Me soul knows no fear of earth and 
Accepts no warning of evil before 
Evil comes. 


Advise me not, my blamer, for 
Calamities have opened my heart and 
Tears have cleanses my eyes, and 
Errors have taught me the language 
Of the hearts. 


Talk not of banishment, for conscience 
Is my judge and he will justify me 
And protect me if I am innocent, and 
Will deny me of life if I am a criminal. 


Love's procession is moving; 
Beauty is waving her banner; 
Youth is sounding the trumpet of joy; 
Disturb not my contrition, my blamer. 
Let me walk, for the path is rich 
With roses and mint, and the air 
Is scented with cleanliness. 


Relate not the tales of wealth and
Greatness, for my soul is rich 
With bounty and great with God's glory. 


Speak not of peoples and laws and 
Kingdoms, for the whole earth is 
My birthplace and all humans are 
My brothers. 


Go from me, for you are taking away 
Life - giving repentance and bringing 
Needless words.

NIGHT AND THE MADMAN


""I am like thee, O, Night, dark and naked; I walk on the flaming path which is above my day-dreams, and whenever my foot touches earth a giant oaktree comes forth."" 

""Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still lookest backward to see how large a foot-print thou leavest on the sand."" 

""I am like thee, O, Night, silent and deep; and in the heart of my loneliness lies a Goddess in child-bed; and in him who is being born Heaven touches Hell."" 

""Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou shudderest yet before pain, and the song of the abyss terrifies thee."" 

""I am like thee, O, Night, wild and terrible; for my ears are crowded with cries of conquered nations and sighs for forgotten lands."" 

""Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thou still takest thy little-self for a comrade, and with thy monster-self thou canst not be friend."" 

""I am like thee, O, Night, cruel and awful; for my bosom is lit by burning ships at sea, and my lips are wet with blood of slain warriors."" 

""Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman; for the desire for a sister-spirit is yet upon thee, and thou hast not become a law unto thyself."" 

""I am like thee, O, Night, joyous and glad; for he who dwells in my shadow is now drunk with virgin wine, and she who follows me is sinning mirthfully."" 

""Nay, thou art not like me, O, Madman, for thy soul is wrapped in the veil of seven folds and thou holdest not thy heart in thine hand."" 

""I am like thee, O, Night, patient and passionate; for in my breast a thousand dead lovers are buried in shrouds of withered kisses."" 

""Yea, Madman, art thou like me? Art thou like me? And canst thou ride the tempest as a steed, and grasp the lightning as a sword?"" 

""Like thee, O, Night, like thee, mighty and high, and my throne is built upon heaps of fallen Gods; and before me too pass the days to kiss the hem of my garment but never to gaze at my face."" 

""Art thou like me, child of my darkest heart? And dost thou think my untamed thoughts and speak my vast language?"" 

""Yea, we are twin brothers, O, Night; for thou revealest space and I reveal my soul."" 
************************************************************************************
Song of the Rain



I am dotted silver threads dropped from heaven 
By the gods. Nature then takes me, to adorn 
Her fields and valleys. 


I am beautiful pearls, plucked from the 
Crown of Ishtar by the daughter of Dawn 
To embellish the gardens. 


When I cry the hills laugh; 
When I humble myself the flowers rejoice; 
When I bow, all things are elated. 


The field and the cloud are lovers 
And between them I am a messenger of mercy. 
I quench the thirst of one; 
I cure the ailment of the other. 


The voice of thunder declares my arrival; 
The rainbow announces my departure. 
I am like earthly life, which begins at 
The feet of the mad elements and ends 
Under the upraised wings of death. 


I emerge from the heard of the sea 
Soar with the breeze. When I see a field in 
Need, I descend and embrace the flowers and 
The trees in a million little ways. 


I touch gently at the windows with my 
Soft fingers, and my announcement is a 
Welcome song. All can hear, but only 
The sensitive can understand. 


The heat in the air gives birth to me, 
But in turn I kill it, 
As woman overcomes man with 
The strength she takes from him. 


I am the sigh of the sea; 
The laughter of the field; 
The tears of heaven. 


So with love - 
Sighs from the deep sea of affection; 
Laughter from the colorful field of the spirit; 
Tears from the endless heaven of memories."

"event","i have dreamt of shadows dancing about me.
sometimes they ask me to join them. sometimes they taunt me
to make me wish to hide from them. some of them 
i almost know, while many are just shadows flittering
on the edge of my vision to make me want to know them.
in these shadows there is hidden some light,
but most of them do not even see this till it is to late. 
i think it is this light that draws me, 
yet i must admit the darkness which holds down this light
draws me stronger sometimes. it beckons to my hidden self, 
to that which i do not know of myself.

"event","Our emotional state of choice is Ecstasy. Our nourishment of choice is Love. Our addiction of choice is technology. 

Our religion of choice is music. Our currency of choice is knowledge. Our politics of choice is none. 

Our society of choice is utopian though we know it will never be. 

You may hate us. You may dismiss us. You may misunderstand us. You maybe unaware of our existence. 

We can only hope you do not care to judge us, because we would never judge you. 

We are not criminals. We are not disillusioned. We are not drug addicts. We are not naive children...

We are one massive, global, tribal village that transcends man-made law, 

physical geography, and time itself. 

We are The Massive. One Massive. 


We were first drawn by the sound. From far away, the thunderous, muffled, echoing beat was comparable to a mother's heart soothing a child in her womb of concrete, steel, and electrical wiring. 

We were drawn back into this womb, and there, in the heat, dampness, and darkness of it, 

We came to accept that we are all equal. Not only to the darkness, and to ourselves, 

but to the very music slamming into us and passing through our souls: we are all equal. 

And somewhere around 35 Hz we could feel the hand of God at our backs, pushing us forward, pushing 

us to push ourselves to strengthen our minds, our bodies, and our spirits., 

Pushing us to turn to the person beside us to join hands and uplift them by sharing the uncontrollable joy we felt 

from creating this magical bubble that can, for one evening, protect us from the horrors, 

atrocities, and pollution of the outside world. It is in that very 

instant, with these initial realisations that each of us was truly born. 

We continue to pack our bodies into clubs, or warehouses, or buildings you've abandoned and left for naught, 

and we bring life to them for one night. 

Strong, throbbing, vibrant life in it's purest, most intense, most hedonistic form. 

In these makeshift spaces, we seek to shed ourselves of the burden of uncertainty 

for a future you have been unable to stabilise and secure for us. 

We seek to relinquish our inhibitions, 

and free ourselves from the shackle's and restraints you've put on us for your own peace of mind. 

We seek to re-write the programming that you have tried to indoctrinate us with since the moment we were born. 

Programming that tells us to hate, that tells us to judge, that tells us to stuff ourselves into the nearest 

and most convenient pigeon hole possible. Programming that even tells us to climb ladders for you, 

jump through hoops, and run through mazes and on hamster wheels. 

Programming that tells us to eat from the shiny silver spoon you are trying to feed us with, 

instead of nourish ourselves with our own capable hands. 

Programming that tells us to close our minds, instead of open them. 

Until the sun rises to burn our eyes by revealing the distopian reality of a world you've created for us, we dance fiercely with our brothers and sisters in celebration of our life, of our culture, and of the values we believe in: 

Peace, Love, Freedom, Tolerance, Unity, Harmony, 

Expression, Responsibility and Respect. 


Our enemy of choice is ignorance. Our weapon of choice is information. Our crime of choice is breaking and challenging whatever laws you feel you need to put in place to stop us from celebrating our existence. 

But know that while you may shut down any given party, on any given night, 

in any given city, in any given country or continent on this beautiful planet, 

you can never shut down the entire party. 

You don't have access 

to that switch, no matter what you may think. The music will never stop. 

The heartbeat will never fade. The party will never end. 


I am a raver, and this is my manifesto.

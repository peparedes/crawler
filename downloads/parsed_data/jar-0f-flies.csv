"event","That was the last time I ever saw her-
 through a shop window, sleeves to her elbows.
 I walked past and kept on walking
 and lit a smoke with my hands shaking.
 
 She was something
She was something else
 
 A few summers ago
 we spent weeks in her room
 just having sex and listening to jazz
 and that was the life.
 
 But I didn't know at the time
 
 Blinds drawn at twelve noon
 with daylight pouring through
 projecting lines on her body
 
 Move on, move on, move on
 Smoke your smoke and move on
 
 I should go back
 see if she's still there
 standing like a statue 




This song is 99.4% relative to me, except for the smoking part."

"event","Before I start to explain this dream, I must mention that there was no prior thought to this before sleeping (e.g. think about something a lot the night before and chances are you might dream about it). Also, this dream may appear very weird and nerdy but I obviously had no control of where this dream went.

We all dream about going back in time somewhere and somehow getting back to tell your friends and family something that would be useful to them for the upcoming future. I had just that, a dream where I accidently went back in time and met up with my family/friends. I know this sounds like a stupid dream but this has ot be one of the most real dreams I've ever had.&nbsp;I'm writing it down here so&nbsp;I don't forget about it:

I was in my room looking through old pictures. I saw that I had a picture of when&nbsp;I was a kid back in the day. I had my digital SLR (key to this story), and I was playing around with the camera. I took a picture of the picture of me when&nbsp;I was a kid. The next thing I remember was that&nbsp;I was in the same room with my brother, except he looked much younger. I asked him what was going on and he asked me who I was. I had explained who&nbsp;I was. He told me he was 14. (Hes turning 25 this August). If he was 14 I would be 11 at the time (this works perfectly because I was 11, turning 12 in November 1999). For some reason my younger self was MIA...it was just the 21 year old version of me and my 14 year old older brother in our room that we both shared back in 1999. It was definitely an outer-body experience that freaked me out for a second in the dream. My camera was stuck on, there was no turning it off. 

I quickly thought that if I&nbsp;said or did too much that it would alter the future and mess things up for the family in the long run. I chose not to tell my brother too much of the future but I did mention four things. First, I told him about 9/11 and that the same people who attacked the WTC in 1993 would attack it again in 2001 and that it would change the country forever. By this time a few of our friends from the neighborhood came over. Ariel (Rel) and Jeremy came over. They were all shocked at who I was and they were also confused of the 'device' I was holding.&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to explain to them who I was and what kind of camera I had. (At around this time in the 90s, Olympus released their first DLSR, I have a Olympus camera...The DSLR was not mainstream at the time seeing as how they cost a few thousand dollars per camera...).

I then had a genius but smart, money-making idea..I wrote down something on a piece of paper for my brother. I&nbsp;gave it to him and told him not to show anyone else for a while...

For some unexplained reason, we then went outside and were walking around town, but before we left the house, I wrote another notebut this time for my younger self to discover. I&nbsp;briefly mentioned a few of my future relationships and how to fix them. While outside, there was some sort of public thing going on and it was the summer so i'm pretty sure we were at Riverfest where there is a lot of people. Everyone was asking me what I had because apparently according to them it seemed pretty futuristic. In addition to this I was dressed as if I was in 2009, so I also stood out from the crowd. Everywhere we walked people were asking me what I was holding. While walking a song by the band &quot;Say Anything&quot; was stuck in my head. (Currently there is a song by that band stuck in my head, the same exact song in the dream).

There was a huge explosion and everyone went running. I fell down and I was running with my brother and friends. I&nbsp;accidently fell ontop of my camera and it was damaged a bit. A part of the body snapped off and zoom function was shot. We took shelter in some sort of rubble when the explosions were still going on.&nbsp;(I have no idea why these explosions were happening and what the significance of this was...). My camera also happened to be low on battery, I had to get going in order to get back to my time.&nbsp;I would have to take a picture of the same picture I took in the beginning. I had the picture of myself from the beginning on me and instead of having a picture of me at 11, it had a picture of me when I was 21...

Before taking a picture of the picture I told my brother that he should stay with his current GF at the time (Christina) and that eventually things would work out for the both of them (They got married in 2008). I also told him to take care of Benjamin (our dog that died in 2003). It was hard saying goodbye but after I did, I took a picture of the picture and then woke up.




During this whole thing,&nbsp;I&nbsp;had no idea where my parents were. Along with my younger self, they were MIA. It could just be that I happened to switch places with my younger self and that he went to the future when I went to the past. 

The note that I gave my brother mentioned that in a few years Apple will release an ipod (2001), and that he should have Dad put as much stock as possible in the company on the stock market so that the shares in the company will be worth millions (lol).


This really was the weirdest and most realistic dream I have ever had."

"event","I remember that queezy feeling i'd always used to get whenever we were about to do something. That embarassingly giddy feeling of just hanging out. Its that feeling that you know you'd rather not do anything else and all your attention is focused on hanging out with/being with that person.<br /><br />I used to get so nervous, seriously. I still do nowadays hanging out with certain people. I'm pretty sure when I see Kate this thursday (hopefully) that I&nbsp;will get that same feeling and won't make a fool of myself.<br /><br />Speaking of those types of feelings, this Rocky Balboa quote just popped up into my head; <strong>&quot;I mean maybe some of you guys got something you never finished, something you really want to do, something you never said to someone, something... and you're told no, even after you paid your dues? Who's got the right to tell you that, who? Nobody! It's your right to listen to your gut, it ain't nobody's right to say no after you earned the right to be where you want to be and do what you want to do!...&quot;</strong><br /><br />Epic.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It has been days since I last talked to her. I blocked her because I feel as if i block the thought completely that won't allow me to even want to think to be with her.&nbsp;Of course i'm still a n00b and think about her all the time, but blocking the avaliability of her even communicating with me helps me stay sane. Shes still out there and only lives several miles away but I have that feeling again as I did in England when i felt thousands of miles away.<br /><br />"

And with my new telephoto camera lens I just got I'm going to get some great pictures this summer that I will turn into posters like this one.<br /><br />I fucking love skimboarding and can't wait to get back into it this spring.<br /><br />Today was a great day.<br /><br />(Ultra top secret words never to be read again)<br /><br />I like Kate a lot (my ex-girlfriend from over 6 years ago) and I am glad we are talking again. She went through the same situation as I did over the past few years (dealing with a cheating ex, etc) and it really makes me feel good that I can talk to her. <br /><br />In addition to that my 2 and a half hour class was very interesting. I am going in Criminology with the hopes of becoming a homicide detective. I love the idea of that but i've recently had my eyes set on the probationary system.&nbsp;My professor who is a regional manager for the probationary circuit of Connecticut is a great teacher who really loves his job.&nbsp;I like the idea of helping out others before they get too far into the criminal justice system (e.g. prison). The idea of diverting a youth or a first-time offender to a lesser sentence not only frees up the courts from all the appeals that will come, it also helps slow down the prison overcrowding situation&nbsp;(which I believe is at 2.1 million for the entire country).&nbsp;Anyways, I just know that if street policing and homicide detective doesn't work out for me,&nbsp;I'd love to do probation. And I also think I would like to get involved in Juvenile Deliquincy. Hey, i might even like to be one of those school resource officers. You know the fully-clothed police officers that appear in highschools and help out etc. I don't know, I just like to help people and I like where my future career is going.<br /><br />In addition to those two things today.&nbsp;I got a GREAT workout at the gym here at Beecher. Shit, I am seeing some results quickly. Holy crap. I just feel overall stronger and healthier.<br /><br />Other than that, everything is fine as of right now. I just rearranged my room and stuff looks real nice. I'm liking this 2009 so far."

What a prick.  What a selfish, moronic, prick.  I'm talking about the skateboarder in this video.  What the hell, if you skate where skating is prohibited (practically everywhere, like in public/private places shown in video should be common sense), you are obviously have a chance of coming into contact with law enforcement.  Now that that is aside, lets go analyze this video and information.  According to the article, the skateboarder 'rolled his ankle'.  Correct me if I am wrong but I believe without a doubt that when you roll your ankle you cannot walk, let alone stand properly.  These idiots clearly used that lame excuse to attempt to get the officer fired.  How the officer conducted the situation was inappropriate and wrong on her part, however, when read up on the article and infer that he obviously made up the rolled ankle bit you just wish she'd push him a little harder, maybe even onto some pavement, not just a nice, soft bush.  Oh, and for the record, I don't hate 'sk8rs', I skate myself.  It just annoys me that morons like this continually give a bad name to all the people who actually skateboard with an IQ over 58.  One last thing about this video, if you watch the last couple of seconds you can notice the person who made the film take a racial cheap-shot at the officer. Wow, sometimes, i hate people.

/rant.

In other news, it looks like my parents will be coming back home from Spain today, time to clean up all the drug paraphernalia and release the three people I have enslaved in my basement.
  
Currently it is still my spring break from college.  I'm working alot, and 'makin da moneys'. I also had the interview for the LP job the other day, I seriously hope I get that.  Seriously, I wish I can get that job and leave the shithole that is HCO. I'm not saying that HCO is bad and I don't want to work there, it's that the pay really blows and I could be making much more money right about now. It was a rough start on my spring break with Gab, but its getting better.  After all this time of knowing her, i didn't think we'd get this close. Coming up on six months soon, shes my dork/nerd/n00b, my Gab. She is also 'attempting' to play Castlevania, and yes Gab, if you are reading this, i said 'attempting', yeah, that's right!. <33

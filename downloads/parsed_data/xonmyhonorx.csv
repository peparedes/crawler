I love my new layout, its vey cool, i wish the eye was blue like mine so i could be like""oh yah, thats my eye"" but its green so now i cant lie....o well

anyway..
friday was mike and I's 6th month anniversary, we double dated with another couple from ND who both look as if they just stepped out of the abercrombie catalog, very surreal.we saw Van helsing, the plot was incoherent and characters came in and out at random but the special effects were really cool.

saturday i hung out with sarina and saw mean girls, it made me not want to make fun of anybody ever again. ate at fuddruckers, went to boba, went home. got ready for the dance, then mike and I went out to eat at il tiramisue, very cute and romantic, it was nice. we went to the dance, took pictures, and danced for a while. it was fun overall. chilled at mikes for a while then went home and slept

Happy Mother's day, i havent seen my mom for more than 15 minutes in the past week, law school sounds hard, i used to want to be a lawyer and now...i dunno(sorry hayley)

this entry is waaaay too long and i gotta go wrap.

peace
love
where is my mom??

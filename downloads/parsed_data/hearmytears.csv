"event","Hey whats goin down? Nothin here.... I just got home from school.

Today was EXTREMELY interesting. To start, we had a fire drill 3 minutes into 2nd period. So we all went outside. I found Shar, so her and I were talking to Colton. God that kid is halarious. Him and I were talking, and he said that he was Bi, and he has a boyfriend. U know what the first thing that came to my mind was? (besides DAMN i wish i were that guy) I FOUND A NEW GAY FRIEND!!! Lol, i was talking to chrysti about it... we're gonna go steal him. Then when we were comming in from the Firedrill, colton bumped into me and was all ""god, watch where your going, slut"" so i said ""Fuck you! you... you... you WHORE!"" omg... we were laughing soooo incredibly hard.

Haha.. good times. Then what else happened?? At lunch Chrysti took her ambien. (she thinks that she gets high off 'em) No she doesnt.... but ya know, whatever. To humor her i pretend. So she gave me the other half... and she TOTALLY thinks that this shit works...so i was acting kinda funny... just ta make her happy. Larry was givin me alot of shit about how im going to ruin my life by doing all those drugs.untill i told him that it was just a half a sleepy pill, and im acting funny just to humor Chrysti. Then he was like oh.... nevermind. o0o0o then guess what else happened!! I told Larry about how much i've been crushin' over Eric.... yes, Larry is like waaay tight with Eric. ^_^ Ya'll know what that means..... BRANDO'S GONNA GET HOOKED UP!!!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!

SKyler got arrested yesterday. No body has heard from him yet, not even his own brother. He got caught smoking. (it was bound to happen eventually) I hope he doesnt get any too serious charges brought up against him.

Okay.. theres this one girl in like.... i dunno... toooo many of my classes. She is totally retarded. If your a girl, she'll call you little sister. and if your a boy, your little brother. yes... broTHER sisTER. She sounds like fuckin cracker. Sorry, i couldnt hold in my irritation any longer! Weeellll... Im going to go take a nap or soemthing. I'll write more later!

<P>I didnt get to talk to Colton that much. Tomorrow should be better.... i have 3 hours with him in the morning. :-D yay. I love my A days. There so much more... lets say ""eventfull"".</P>
<P>Okay, so everyone knows that J and i are currently Broken up right? right. Well if shes plannin' on makin' a move again, she better hurry before the chance passes her by.</P>
<P>So anyways. Guess what i did? I repierced my bellybutton. Last night i found out that the hole wasnt fully closed, so i put my earing in it. Then Today while i was taking a bath, the hole looked like it kind of stretched a litlte. So i just took an earing off my ear and put it in. So my bellybutton is now repierced. Bellybutton ring and all. Im happy about that. I look soo much better with it peirced.</P>
<P>Dinner time, im out.</P>

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I cut my hair yesterday. Its really short in the back.... and a little longer in the front. I like it. Im sure that Janice'll hate it, but thats too bad, it had to be done. HaHa... that was my ""im single"" act. Im sure that it'll actually grow quite a bit before the wedding. After this im going to just let it grow right down to my ass. I dont care what anyone else wants. Thats what i want. Its kind of what i've always wanted.... 8th grade was the closest that i've had to it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I've been talking to SImone alot more. It makes me really really happy. I've missed her and machaela sooo bad since all of that shit happend.... right now i really need some stability in my life. I feel so.... Lost. Lost is the closest word that i can find to how I've been feeling lately. Which is weird, because I actually have been feeling more like i belong here lately. School starting was a blessing in disguise. But when it comes to my Family, Everyone that i love, and my life in general, im blind in a forrest. Im 15. Within the next year I'll be able to drive.In the next 2 years i'll be able to smoke. In the next 3 years I'll be able to Vote, and I'll be out on my own. I feel overwhelmed and alone already. I have to start thinking about money, cars, College. I feel like a little kid at a carnaval... all of the lights and sounds taking over my senses... so excited to go on the rides... but still so scared. I WISH i was 4 again... runnin' around the house.... jumping into my dads arms...My mom rocking me in the big brown chair. Fuck that carnival shit. I feel like im drowning.... watching all the other kids with their floaties, but i have none. THATS what i feel like. God i need stability. Tho i guess that not too many teenagers have any right now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Schools tomorrow... ima go catch up on some good 'ol R&amp;R while i still can.</FONT></P>

We had an assembely, but I didnt go, I just stayed in the Lunch room... hung out with skyler, zach, and colton *Melts* We all just hung out and talked.... I talked to Colton quite a bit... hes a funny ass kid.... not to mention hot as hell too!!!!(hes a drummer.....&nbsp;yummy!!!!) lol. Then i had to go back to psychology, and i have psychology with him. We were sitting there smilin' and lookin at eachother the whole time...or as my mother would say ""making googly eyes"" lol... my moms a tard!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>What else, what else.... I get to go to the wedding.... haha, i cant remember if I have notified everybody yet or not. Its going to be back in virginia.... yay!!!! I get to wear the dress that i was going to wear for my grandpa's wedding... it'll be fun. (I LOVE dressing up) only 15 days!!!o0o0o u know what that reminds me? Today Chrysti told me that she was actually born in North Carolina... she was an army brat. Isnt that awesome?!?! Lol... i totally never knew either.. crazy shit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>Hmmn... Im kind of frusterated... I cant seem to get Eric's attention quite as much as i would like. (hot ""my husband"" look alike) So i think that ima just concentrate on Colton for a while.....^_^.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>Janice and I are kind of weird right now... i think. To be quite honest, i really dont know. its sooo bad! whenever i talk about her, i keep callin' her my girlfriend, not my ex. Yes, ima tard, i know. I even did it again TODAY when i was writing larry a note. Yes... larry... haha, i think i scared him off... he doesnt bug me at lunch anymore. Sounds like that dislocated shoulder served its purpose.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#999999>Tomorrow im going to strip some wallpaper in the bathrooms, so that i can earn a couple bucks to spend towards my piercing kit.

<P><STRONG>School has been okay i guess. Im already dying from lack of sleep. Lets see, I fell asleep in English, and ASL. Haha... Health i was too busy watchin some hottness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-P , same with Psychology. I actually ate lunch today tho.... that made me feel a little better... plus the fact that i talked to J up untill i got lunch. She got her braces off today. She says that she looks soo much prettier wtihout them... to be honest i probably wont even notice that they're gone when i see her. She always looks the same to me...amazing.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Chris still isnt here.... Last night i kept whinning that i missed him. Every five minutes i was like ""how long till chris gets home??"" Hes going to be the hardest to leave when i move out. I love him so much. I sure hope that he and i keep sucha close relationship for the rest of our lives. So i guess now i have a&nbsp; little sister too... Jen Jen adopted me! Yay. Now i have everything that i could ever want. I love you jen jen!!!!!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Im still not exactly sure where J and I stand right now. Im pretty sure that im going to the wedding. Im excited about that... what, like 16 days untill i get to hang out with them?? i think so. im not sure. J and I kind of asked eachother what we were today. it was kind of funny.&nbsp;Seems like we're always in this uncomfortable in-between. Where deep down we know EXACTLY what we want the other one to say... but neither of us have the balls to say it. Its kind of funny how we get embarassed about stuff like that, but we can sit there and just be discusting infront of eachother... and LAUGH... and tell our deepest secrets, like its nothing.&nbsp; Just like, she never sings infront of just me. Why? I dunno. Shes only done it once. ""The worst is Over now, and we can breathe again"" Just like i WONT dance infront of her... its not like im retarded at it either. i have alot of rhythm.... i just get all giggly... yes, i know we're stupid. ;-) Its just weird how that works. Honesty doesnt seem to come very easily between us either. Whatever</STRONG></P>

<P><FONT color=#000099>I am sooo....Ecstatic. Yes, thats it. Im ecstatic. I went the WHOLE goddamned first week of school. NO second thoughts, NO panic attacks, NO faking sick, NOTHING. Just getting up like i should, getting ready, leaving, and going to school. Like a NORMAL kid. For those of you who know how it was before, arent you proud?!?!?! I've even been interacting with people.... I havnt been shy little depressed brandon. I've been talking, hanging out with people that i actually LIKE at lunch, answering questions in class, not being afraid of stupid shit. This is an event to be celebrated. Lol... Im a TaRd I know............ but isnt it just fuckin awesome?!?!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So what else is going on?? Uhhh... I think on wednesday night I came home and slept from 4 until 8:30... stayed up until 10:30, and then slept until 6:30 in the morning. It was nice, and DEFINATLY needed. This whole 'waking up early' idea is just killin' me. It'll be nice sleepin' in this weekend. SO Heres a WARNING: DONT CALL ME AND WAKE ME UP ANY EARLIER THAN 11!! Because (even if you do live in Idaho) I will not pause before runnin' up there and pinching you really really hard. LOL. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>OMG OMG OMG&nbsp; okay... get this..... Larry Foote. (some of you might remember him as that one fucker who is a violent prick) Yes, I think that I am his latest Infatuation. HA like that kid has a chance in hell! number one... UGLY... number two... PRICK number 3..... hes too full of himself to realize how much of a lowlife he is.&nbsp; THis son of a bitch wanted a drink of my pop, but we were in the Library, and I didnt wanna get it taken away so i was like ""No..."" Larry was like ""Just gimme a goddamned drink"" I looked at his ugly ass and was like ""well with that attitude you can kiss my ass"" THen he wouldnt drop it, and he was being a fuckin immature little brat about it, and he said something that totally offended me, and i smacked his shoulder..... but he hit me back.... HARD. and i was all ""didnt your mama teach you not to hit girls?!"" then he like tapped my shoulder.... maybe he was thinkin he was funny or something? I dont know... and i was like ""dude.... thats not a hit... retard"" then he punched my left arm. and was like ""does that count?"" I fuckin turned around, and nailed him right in his shoulder.... and im wearing this huge fake diamond ring..... yah..... he just about fell on the floor. (pussy) Then he was whining and shit about it, and how bad it hurt, and how he thought that i had dislocated it. I was like... ya kno what? "" 1. when i say no, i mean NO. 2. Dont you ever touch me again, it pisses me off...... this was NOTHING. DONT ever let it happen again"" Next time that he does shit, he'll get it in the face.... it should leave a nice scar on both his ugly face, and dilusional ego.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So yes... that was pretty much the highlight of&nbsp;my day. Pat and Patti are going to stay the night tonight, and I need to go practice my sign language..... (im gettin good at it!!)</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff0000 size=7>S<FONT color=#000000 size=2>econd day of school wasnt too bad. I just feel asleep too late last night, I couldnt keep my eyes open long enough to watch southpark... and it turned out to be a good one.... damnit.&nbsp; Whatever, I was tired enough this morning. I woke up at 6:30... i must be gettin real good at gettin ready, it only took me a half an hour. haha... and I thought I was movin' slow. Drawing Just about killed me. Kaitlin and I were talking about how its sad when we're dreading Art. Its just too easy for the two of us. World History would've been a hell of alot better had i not been sleeping. Lol.... After I got my assignment done, we still had another 1/2 hour left. Both Ryan and I were trying our hardest to let the time fly. (we were hungry as shit) but it wouldnt! so i layed on my desk with my eyes closed, barely sleeping for a half an hour. It was nice. That combined with the pizza at lunch woke me up for Algebra and Chemistry. I had a shit load of Chemistry and Algebra homework. All J's doin is like playin' games and stuff.... lol, and im getting homework. So over all today wasnt all that bad.... besides being waaay too damn long. It really sucks when all of your classes are 1 1/2 hours long. Tomorrow wont be bad at all.... I have FUN classes tomorrow. I've got Sign Language, Psychology, Lunch, then English and Health. PLUS I dont have to carry numerous text books in my back pack all day.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=7>T<FONT color=#ff0000 size=2>here is a huge storm comming, I can feel it. My poor older dog pongo is freaking out. Storms really scare her. Which is totally weird, cuz they always calm me... OH! I gotta go open my windows. hold on. Alright, Im back, did you miss me? OF COURSE YOU DID! :-P But anyways......</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=7><FONT color=#ff0000 size=3>&nbsp;<FONT size=7>I </FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=2>am in such a good place mentally right now. Its actually really suprising. Even my dad has noticed lately. I figured that soon as school started i'd completely break down again. But I didnt. and I dont feel an extreme ammount of stress... no fear... nothin. Im even socializing! *gasp!* I know!!!! At lunch I've been hanging out, and I was even just playin around, and actin like the dork that i am at lunch. It was an awesome feeling. I havnt even been shy in the past two days. I'm talkative, and not afraid of people judging me. You guys are all like *sarcasm* OH YAY FOR BRANDON, SHE FIGURED OUT HOW TO BE NORMAL. But this is a super HUGE AMAZING thing for me.&nbsp; I know that its only been 2 days, and it COULD go all down hill from here.... and it might. But im lookin' at school not as a hell hole that is only in my vocabulary so that i can graduate and leave. Now its like....... CHRYSTI! SKYLER! fun classes OTHER PEOPLE! You know who I have to thank for it? (haha, besides my meds, and my therapists and awesomely cool family) My baby girl. Im sure that I could have done this school shit on my own, and been happy with it, and made friends and shit.... but she made me complete.&nbsp; Thank you baby girl. I love you.&nbsp; Now all that I need to do is get my best friends back, and then my life will be PERFECT.&nbsp; Well yes, Its just about time for me to go.... SImpsons are almost on, and im bored. haha. I'll Catch ya'll later!</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=7>S</FONT>orry about the post last night. I was a little messed up over school, and i was just in a vewy VEWY touchy mood. I appologize. I'd like to assure you that everything is all better now, and im all better now.</P>
<P><FONT size=7>S</FONT><FONT size=3>o. Today was my first official day of high school. I DIDNT GET LOST!!&nbsp;Arent you guys&nbsp;proud?? Well, i got a little turned around for a few&nbsp;seconds, but it was quickly solved&nbsp;. In my first Period (sign) Skylers in there with me! Im really happy that he is. So is my newest buddy Ryan. Uhhh... no body is in my Psyc. Class. But English (3) I have Skyler, Shar, Chrysti, and Larry.... yes, long story with Larry, ill esplain later. I dont have anyone in 4th with me. in Art (5) I have this one chick from my drawing class last year. We were making fun of how easy the class is going to be. OMG my Drawing Teacher looks like Martha Stewart!!! (but my teachers non-bitchyness led me to the conclusion that Martha Stewart ISNT hiding from the police in Utah) I have Ryan and Peggy in my 6th period, Larry(oh yay.... *eye roll*) and GEORGE!!! IM SOO HAPPY TO HAVE A CLASS WITH GEORGE!!! GEORGE IS THE BESTEST EVER!!! Lol..... I freaked when I saw him. Then for my chemistry class, they decided that I should be in Honors Chem. instead of applied Chemistry. Sounds good to me... my new teacher is nicer anyways. Hmmn... that about raps it up for the day. Tomorrow i have all my hard classes. It sucks not having a locker, i gotta carry around my books ALL day long.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=7>O</FONT><FONT size=3>h Yeah, By the way, I decided to create a Live Journal. My xanga got really boring. Plus with this one, i can change my text more than My stupid xanga. Sooo... if you dont like it, then please kiss my ass.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=7>O</FONT><FONT size=3>k, So with the whole Larry thing... hes this jack-off excuse for a guy. He thinks hes all big and bad, and hes just an adverage-insecure-asshole. I think im his new obsession. But no thanks.... Im not lookin for love, i already found it. Bsides, Im not lookin for love with some Ballsack who beats his girlfriends. Jesus..... Ima tell Skyler to switch me seats so that I dont have to sit next to him. He makes me uncomfortable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=7>W</FONT><FONT size=3>ell I need to go take a shower and relax a little. I hope that everyone else had a good day, and i hope to hear about it soon!!!!!</FONT></P>

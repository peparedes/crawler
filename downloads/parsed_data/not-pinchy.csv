"event","So I guess it's been about two months since the last time I had an entry.  School started and I've just been too busy with all the other garbage I've got going so I just haven't had any time for this sorta stuff.  Then, since I stopped writing I kinda forgot I even had one of these until the other day.  I decided that I'd make a sort entry cause I've got nothing better to do right now.  I had my Thanksgiving dinner tonight.  Oh Lord how I love turkey!!  Although, I was thinking about the whole Thanksgiving thing the other day and it occured to me that we're thanking god for all this great food by killing one of his creations.  Doesn't bother me at all really but I just found it a bit interesting.  
Oh well, don't really now where i'm going with this entry but whatever.  Went to Shawn's last night that was awesome.  Greg had to go home at 11:30 that was really too bad because the party was for him.  Oh well, we partied extra hard for him and Jamie.  So we just played Tony Hawk and watched TV for awhile then broke out the booze at like 1 in the morning.  I don't know it made sense at the time.  Dave Shawn and I had a 26er of Smirnoff to ourselves thats the perfect amout for me I must say.  And Shawn mixed the drinks most excellently.  We then went back to the Nintendo and played Mario Kart which was interesting to say the least.  We talked for awhile then went to bed at 4:30 it was most goodly fun.  Many good times had at Shawn's house and many more to be had no doubt.  

Just alittle explanation now about partying hard for Jamie.  Jamie was unable to attend because he was chosen as one of three drivers to drive Formula 2000 fully sponsered.  YAY Jamie!!!  I did just as you said and partied double hard just for you.  Good Luck

Well this is enough from me for now.  Won't be as long between entries next time I  promise

"event","Today was pretty interesting.  I went to work from 12-6 again and again another very easy.  I had a hour paid break it was awesome.  I went and took and quick nap and watched TV and the best part I got paid for it.  Sorry enough rubbing it in.  Anyways I went to see a movie with Dave I was the wingman for a blind date.  It was funny cause I was needed immediately.  Turns out the girl was 13.  So I got Dave out of the date which will require alot of explaining so I won't get into it here.  SO Dave and I ended up going to see SWAT instead.  That was a really good movie.  I was impressed.  I'm not a huge fan of Colin Farell's acting ability but he wasn't too bad in this movie with a few exceptions.  After the movie Dave and I were walking around and we saw the girl and she was pissed it was really funny but Dave felt bad for it.  I didn't care at all it wasn't my date.  We walked over to Rodgers and talked to Alana for awhile but she was really busy so we decided to leave.  When I told my Dad about the night he was pissing himself laughing but my Mom was so annoyed it wasn't funny.  I've got a feeling I'm not the good son anymore :(
Oh well I've got more good news!  The bitch is gone!  Hurray!  My brother got the balls and dumped Harmony I'm so freakin' happy.  The only problem now is that he is still hung up on her and won't let it go.  I'm gonna have to do something about that.  Any ideas?
Later"

"event","Today was pretty good I didn't really do to much but I'm just enjoying the last couple of days before school starts again.  I drove my sister down to the ballet store today and was rather pissed when I ddn't see any hot dancers.  Then I took my money over to Shawns to get me signed up for the whitewater rafting but then Akira went off and broke his collarbone playing rugby.  Way to go Akira!  So we've decided to go next summer.  I then slept off the rest of the day.  Went to Shawns at 8:30 (fashionably late)  We were supposed to be there 7:30.  We watched Family Guy and Simpsons for awhile and watched the starting of some shitty movie (The Truth About Charlie) almost as bad as Open Range but not quite.  Gotta work tommorrow and then going to see a movie with Dave.  I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have a job.  Recently I've been spending my money like a drunken millionaire I've gotta stop though.  Its starting to hurt the bank accout.  I'm going to go and read now 'night"

"event","I'm thinking pretty highly of myself at the moment if you couldn't already tell.  I went to Bayshore yesterday and got two shirts and a pair of jeans and the Coldplay cd I've been meaning to get forever now.  My new clothing makes me look so damn hot I want myself:p!  Urban Trade is an awesome store.  The only problem is that I figured out when I got home that one of the shirts is dry clean cleaning only cause its silk.  That's gonna be a little bit annoying but it's a very nice shirt either way.  Stupid me though I went off and put another $10000 in GICs and all that other garbage just before I went out and spent all this money and now I've got a grand total of (wait for it) $0.16 in my spending acount and my mom won't let me touch the money in my other accouts  so I've got to make the $10 in my wallet last for  another week and a half until I get my next paycheck.  Oh well the next check is gonna be another big one to replenish my money supply.  Speaking of work I'm gonna be 4th in senority in about 2 weeks.  So thats means I got basically all the shifts that I want.  Hurrah for working at the same home for 3 years now.  I went driving again tonight I am really good according to my mom and brother the only thing I hate is driving the huge van it handles like a freaking shopping cart so I can't wait until I start with the civic.  I hate parking too although I getting pretty good it is generally a pain is ass to get that van between the lines and sraight.  Micheal Schumacher or however you spell it look out here i come!  I guess I shoud go now.  Apperently they are starting to do rolling blackouts again starting tonight at 10 so before I get my entry deleted I will go."

"event","I just wrote a pretty big entry but my internet fucked up and deleted the whole damn entry.  Fuck  hate computers.  They are truly stupid machines.  Dammit!  Oh well it's almost midnight but since i got nothing tbetter to do I guess I'll write out the whole thing again.(Yes, you don't need to tell me I have a pretty sad life.  Just sitting here rewriting an entry when I could be sleeping.  Well to all of you that think that why FUCK YOU :P)  

Okay where to begin?  Oh yes, I went out for a run tonight and realized that for some teenagers hate runners.  I just couldn't understand it.  I a span of about 35 minutes about 5 or 6 teens drove by me tellin me to ""fuck off"".  I really don't understand why.  I really don't care much either but more so curious as to why they feel the need to tell me to fuck off?  Oh well what are ya gonna do? Whatever floats their boat I guess.

I really can't remember what I wrote here last time so I'll just skip over to what happeed at the MTO today.  So as some of you already know I went to get my licence today or at least tryed to.(Who knew they would want identification?  Yeah, yeah I know I'm stupid so please feel no need to call me on that one!  My dad already has.)  I showed up at the place and the first thing they asked me for was a birth certificate.  I tryed to use my health card and numerous other identifications I have in my wallet but apparently I need some little piece of paper stating that I was born as if there wasn't enough proof standing right in front of the women not only was I standing directly in front of her but she could also check my dad's head for all the grey hairs I've caused:P  That is something I really don't understand in this world.  Why the hell to human beings need both birth and death certificates?  Okay I understand that we all need some kind of identification but honestly.  Do you really need proof that I was born when I'm sytanding right in front of you when a health card show my birth date?  And what the hell is up with a death certificate?  What in God's name are we gonna do with a certificate if we're dead?  Again I do realize that we all need some sort of identification but I have more than enough identification in wallet all with photos signatures birthdates and so on.  But, it just wasn't enough to get my licence.  Oh well new plan.  I'm gonna try and get my licence while in Perth tomorrow at the dentist.  Thats right for some reason my family feels it necessary to drive 40 minutes out of our way just to see the old family dentist in Perth.(I used to live in Perth for those who didn't know.  i used to be even more of a hick thanI am now living in Stittsville)  I really don't understand myself why we need to go to him but we do so what can ya do?  I guess I'm done.  Hopefully the computer won't screwup this time otherwise I'm writing this again.

Sleepy time for Andrew.  Oh and for anyone looking for some good night time reading like I'm about to do may I suggest both A Matter of Honour and Honour Among Thieves both by Jeffery Archer both are excellent!

G'night to everyone"

"event","Not much to say right now so just a quick update cause I got nothing better to do at the moment.  I'm going to go and get my G1 today really excited about that!  I gotta go and get some time off work today because the management at that place is so messed up its not even funny.  I swear, my mule could run that place better than they do.  And I'm telling you it is not a bright mule it took three times biting the electrical fence before it stopped :P.  Oh well the only good thing about having people like that in the world is that poeple like me who are going somewhere in life don't have to work in a dead end job!"

"event","Thats right my Mother and I celebrate the same day.  I feel really feel sorry for my Mom.  For her birthday 1987 she had to push me out of her*shuddering at the thought*  Oh well whatever happy birthday Mommy!  After a couple days of nothing but pessimistic thoughts I'm think I'm back to normal. Yey!!  Oh and as you might have seen on the left I have scanned the Shannon puking sign into the computer and can now e-mail to anyone who wants it so just gimme an e-mail or a reply to this or something like that.  You get the picture.  Thats about it for now.  Except for the fact that I've renewed my extreme hatred fo cats!  Whenever my grandmother comes over (which happens to be just about every weekend which begs the question as to why the hell she spends thousands of dollars every month just to stay in a nice retrement home when shes never there?) she always has to bring her stupid cat.  I hate that thing.  The stupid cat puked twice on the carpet.  I really don't like stupid things they just bother me.  Why have a helpless animal in the house thats just gonna crap and puke all over the floor?  It just doesn't make any sense to me at all."

"event","Yep more complaining today.  Just to warn ya before you read the whole thing.  Again today I had an extremely unproductive day.  First I was awaken at 7:45 by my dad just so he could tell me that he left me a list of shit to do for the day.  At that point I was way too pissed off to go back to bed.  So I lay in my bed listening to Oldies because I was too tird and lazy to get my ass out of bed to change the radio station.  Luckily, Oldies isn't that bad I've decided.  Anyways then I got up and checked the supid list and it had everything on it.  I was supposed clean up the whole damn house including vacuuming and mopping then waxing the floors and so on.  And then my left a tiny little note that pissed me off the most he siad ""have fun"".  When the fuck am I supposed to have fun when I'm still babysitting and I gotta clean the house?  My sister then surpirsingly came and asked if she could help with anything.  SO I let her do some vacuuming while I went to clean the bathrooms.  Minutes after I go upstairs to do some work I hear Fiona yelling for help.  I come downstairs and she had knocked over a large plant so know there was soil all over the floor and the grand piano.  So now there is a huge bown stin on the floor and I just know that I'm definatly gonna get blamed for it.  I was so pissed off that I started to yell at her and then I just left and went for a bike ride one thing that normally makes me happy but today I was even more pissed off by the end of it.  Apparently everthing between Stittsville and Richmond smells either like Cow shit or died skunk so thats all I could the whole ride and I was so slow it was unbelievable.  And now to top off the most wonderful day in history I have to go to work!  The only sorta nice thing that happened today was that when I read my horoscope for the day it said that ""people are gonna piss me off today and there is no point in trying to hide what i think about them.""  I thought that was just great because I've told a couple people what I honestly thought about them today and it made me feel pretty good.  You know not holding back what I want to say about people.  Normally I'm pretty calm and nice and as Ali likes to call me ""level-headed"" today is just not my day.  And I got a feeling the next couple of days won't be great either.  Tomorrow is my birthday but I just know that its gonna be disapointing so I'm not looking forward to putting on a huge fake smile just to make my mom happy when I unwrap some crappy present that I didn't ask for.  Oh well whatcha gonna do?  I figure things can't get much worse form here...can they?"

"event","I guess this is my first entry here in the journal.  I guess I should say why I got one of these to start?  This is for you Soteira!  Here is my attempt at opening up to people and being me more than I have been for the last 2 years.  So I'm gonna try and say whats on my mind to you and hopefully I'll get used to it and be alot more open at school this year.  I guess this may be a little bit short for a first entry but whatever I'm outta stuff to say for now.  Also thanks to Ali for the name I love it! And to Carolyn for the code and help with the set up."

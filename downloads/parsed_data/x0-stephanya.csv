HOkay.  so this weeks been kinda lame... lotta shit to do, but i got it done. bwhaha. anyways. yesterday was friday <3 thank god. went to adams after school for a lil while.. then he drove me home and i hadda fuckin sprint inside cuz i was supposed to pick cait up at 6:10 to get to school for practice @ 6:30.... but i didnt get home till about 6:15? so i fuckin went about 60 all the way to school, cut off a truck, almost rearened a minivan =D we got there about 5 min late, but suprisingly the coach didnt care? bwhahaha. so anyways practice was supposed to be from 6:30 - 9:30... so we get there and my coach is like. heres the deal. right now we're gonna get out at 9. if you do good on all the drills we'll keep subtracting time and you can get outta here as early as 8:30. so, we did do good... and we were supposed to get out at 8:40 but then stupid varsity took forever.. and we were supposed to play this game against them ((which we fuckin kicked their ASSES lemme say)) and we got out at about 9 anyways O_o
yea so then the cait & kristin went to steak & shake for some dinner. . . came home cuz it was snowing so goddamned bad, yea so i came home, chilled, showered and went to sleeep <3


meh, hadda wake up early today and drive my dad to work so i can have the car & go to this picnic thing for all the softball teams and their families?  then who knows...?   


peace out lovers </3"

"event","like the title says. a REALLY REALLY good day. 

woke up and was super tired. so i turned on my straightener and then went back to sleep till 645... mikey got to my house a lil late so i was able to get more time to get ready... we parked at a new place behind jewel so like. i was really cold walkin to school cuz i only had my lil fleece. but anyways. school was alright. i got NoOoO homework which was a very happy thing.

ok so at tryouts today. i totally sucked the cock. my arm was hurting SO bad from pitching and my collarbone was still killing. my legs were hurtin from running and yea. jus wasnt a good tryout. but today was an easy day which made it nicer... no mile for us cuzza the track girls.. thanks track girls :D
so after the tryout. the coaches met in a room for like a halfhour to discuss the teams i guess? the finally around 6 the varsity and jv coaches came out and went down the hall into the underground track and then we all jus kinda got in a random line and they called each of us down and told us if we made it or not... and im OFFICIALLY A PART OF THE 2005 DGN JV SOFTBALL TEAM :D:D:D:D:D yayz! n i finna pitch too haha. im uber excited for the season since most of the team from last year is back together.. sept for the wonderful maddie hohn who hadda be all amazing-like and be on varsity :( but its cool cuz im SO proud of her.. so anyways
tryouts- got out earlier than expected and being the fuckin hawt ass mafucka he is.. adam picked me up and drove me home again.. so got home. ate dinner. showered. and now im online and fillin this crap out.... but other than tryouts..... 


todays a really happy day :D <3


i love you,

softball tryouts (take 2) today. actually, im very proud of myself. i pitched today and i felt really good about it. i finally got a good handle on the 4-5 pitches i can actually throw. . . i dont think its hit me yet that i find out if i made it tomorrow. O_o... SCAREDDDDDD. i donno wut im gonna do with my time if i dont make it, im so sick of sitting on my ass after school everyday. so after tryouts adam picked me up cuz he fuckin rules and drove me home.. then i came home, fell onto the couch, ate dinner and took a nice HAWT bubble bath n soaked my whole body cuz im SO effin soar. but someone once said ""if you're not hurting, you're not playing hard enough"" which is so true bitches. so yea anyways. 

cuts for softball tomorrow... SOO nervous. gotta be at school till like 7 or some stupid shit like that maybe to wait and find out.. but i think adams pickin me up again n yea.. ill update tomorrow when i get

<br> 
on saturday. i went to el mall con amy lex n kristin and we pimped it out. pics are on lexie.s pic site. theyre hot fo sho. then we chilled back at amys till we took lex home n me n amy met kris up at school n we saw the *awesome* _cough_ play for school cuz. we both needed the extra credit like noo other. but with the help of our sneakyness. we left early n went to dennys n chilled there for a while with adam and 3 of his friends? don.t remmer names really. except dylan cuzs amy thought he was hawt. haha <3 then we dropped off my car n got amys n went to brys to say hello to the party goin down over there after turnabout O_o interesting times. and then. we went to amys and partied FOR SURE. well. i did lol. then at about 2am we went over to brys again to get rach n such n came back to amys and, i definately passed out.

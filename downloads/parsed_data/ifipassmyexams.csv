Who in the hell does he think he is?

<i>Martha. You've been a tremendous friend and a tremendous help to me these last few months. Diamond in the rough, that's Martha Jones. You're going to make one terrific doctor. </i>

Just a friend.  

He takes me all over time and space, traps us both in 1913 where I spend months pretending to be a bloody <i>maid</i> and looking after him, gets us potentially trapped in another universe to save his old girlfriend, and okay, he got us back.  Then he just disappears leaving me to babysit said old girlfriend and her family, and what do I get?  Nothing even remotely personal.  

Jack and Torchwood, he wouldn't be here without, well what about the rest of us, hmm?  Jack's not the only one who's saved his hide, but he manages to forget that, doesn't he.  I know he's a time traveller, but they couldn't have been gone that long, Jack doesn't look a day older, not nearly enough time could have gone by for him to forget.  And he doesn't forget. 

Luke and Sarah Jane, whoever the hell they are, they get htings like ""the best"" and ""amazing.""  Mickey and Jake get a tipped hat.  Jackie and Pete are welcoming and them and Jack, they're <i>family</i>.

I won't even talk about bloody Rose.  

That's it though, really.  They're all family, and then there's me.  The outsider.  It's like he had this whole other life, then he lost it and met me, and now that the old life's back, I barely matter anymore.

I'll be a terrific doctor.  I knew that much, didn't need him telling me that.  I've been such a bloody fool, following him everywhere, waiting around for him, thinking that the adventure would just keep going, thinking that if I just stuck around for long enough, then he'd finally notice I exist.  But it won't, will it?  <i>He</i> won't.  He's got his family back, he doesn't need me for anything.

I can take a hint.  As soon as whatever it is he's freaking out over dies down, I'm getting out.  I deserve better than this.

...He's been blogging.  He's been bloody <i>blogging</i>.  I don't understand it.  Whole of time and space, and he types into a little box on the internet.  Not that I'm supposed to know, mind you.  I was nosing through files in the TARDIS, and there it was.

Oh, but it's not just him blogging.  No, seems he found a way to talk to Rose on the internet, and is planning on tracking her down in some alternate universe, and something like that's just bound to be dangerous.  And there's this middle-aged woman, Sarah Jane Smith, who he seems to know.  She's been helping him with something, and he's been talking to her <i>son</i>.

It's like he's got this whole life out there and I don't know a thing about it.  He's never going to let me in, not really.

And John Smith isn't much better.  He still doesn't see me.

I won't be invisible.  If we ever make it back, I'm tracking his activities on the internet.  I won' t be left behind and forgotten.  He'll see me.  I just know it."

Some things never change.  Even as a human, with a new past, a new set of memories (manufactured though they may be), I'm nothing more than a... a maid, a servant.  I'm nothing to him.  The thing I don't understand, is that he created the memories, or the TARDIS did. If I'm so important to this plan, why am I so unimportant to John Smith?  

I don't even matter enough for him to think of me when he's creating a new persona.

He brings me here, strands me in this place where I'm nothing more than a black servant, where every day I hear things that a man would be decked for thinking back home, and I still don't matter to him.  Not in the slightest.  He could have picked anywhere, anytime.

He could have brought me back home, let me finish my training, take my exams, and care for him while The Family slowly wither and die, but no.  He brings me to this place where he can be as human as they come, but I'm just a piece of rubbish.

Rose still matters.  He dreams about her, sometimes.  ""She sounds lovely,"" I say.  ""Oh, Rose again?""  I can't ask him anything, because they're just dreams, and he doesn't remember the important bits.  Still, even when he's not himself, he remembers her.

He doesn't even see me."

we never know, do we? so i want to live life, there's always a chance even with you, i have friends you know, tho sometimes i wonder

do we need to learn to live in a world with heart where making true friends wouldd be easy - i wonder every single day - maybe we never learn to live in a world of love where change can happen and we can still love with or without change in a world where extreme rules

all by myself, always, too tired now, too used to it to fight that status quo// sometimes i almost feel it... but once the world is with me, so many time i can count a world with me , who counts? I don't i have everyone to remind me

i can't tell the difference between my heart, my soul and my body any more



this place is killing me, i've been alone and faced worse fates - why does it bother me now, why do i need my comfort zone to be here?   maybe i just need acomfort zone, well i'm fucked then aren't i, oh yes...."

"event","my eyes, they carry no reflection - why don't i see the beautiful world.... 

what you feel is what i felt for you, take my hand and you always do, where are you now?  i know you'll find what you believe what you see 

what better way, i remind myself to keep you from seeing what you want to see, how you feel, only now i fear i can't take anymore time, alone, to belive that life is better than living - how can that be, you never even see me

you pay me no attention, i know no-one listens to me.. from the moment i wake to the moment i sleep i'll be there just to see if you care, but i already know you can't, i awake to find no peace of mind as a fugitive, someone show me the right way to go, i'm feeling so bad you don't know, everything crawling out of every corner, don't know if can sleep from fear, i forget everything i have learnt, feeling so bad

when i felt good it was only because nothing could touch me, just strangers

you just want me to change, like everyone lese, but i can't change for you - but i'll always be waiting for you, and this my final chance ..  but if in doubt, try and stop me, i'll be waiting 

my heart should be young, i wait, its what i do, i'll be strong, won't let you down, that's what you think, its what you wish keeping me on the sides thinking i will be waiting, you might be wrong, what if its already too late? for who, for me its always been to late, for you, i don't know"

"event","wow... when was the last time i did that? 

only in my dreams do i have a concept of how it feels

i'm not sure i want to hear anyone breathe beside me anymore, maybe i'm all that nobody's needs - if only i could have chosen to be something other than what i am, it is something i would change - i turn in my sleep, awoken by dreams i don't want to know about ... too earthly there are things i don't want to feel any more, this i am sure of

i'm so lonely and yet so not.. i can see what i don't want to be reminded of in life in myself, my head hurts i think i want to be with someone pure and yet cannot find myselt in ayone's company

i'm saturated with thoughts .. for too long .. just to be with someone however momentarily  - I've only met a handful of men i can truly be with in my lifetime, i know its me i build barriers and yet cannot help myself

if only i could weep.. would i feel anything? i'm not convinced

alcohol doesn't help anymore, i just want to be.... answers they just never come to me

daylight hours bring different thoughts than the hours you spend alone.. thoughts staring at four walls even with with people, wy do imiss my firned so much, maybe because we could talk

my plant is dying like me but i think it will have a more humane and quicker deminse than what my own inertia has in store for me - i have a vague concept f what hell was i know i felt a lot, not like now, i play with people, they don't want to play, maybe its just with me they don't want to play with, how strong must i be?

hell has a certain energy, if i could sell my soul tonight i would have to ask if there was a price - maybe i just sold out a long time ago 

its nearly one in the morning and i fear it will be another one of those nights i dont sleep until 5/6 am - i'm not sorry for my weary life.... what's it like to be afraid ?"

"event","whirr whirr the mobile interrupts my lull - who is it I wonder, in dread.. i really don't want to talk to anyone.  I see the caller display.  It could be news, I think, I better pick up.

'So your picking up today' the voice inquires 'Yes, you have no idea how luck you are' i respond 'mnn, i think i have an idea' she responds and so we skirt.

She asks me how i'm feeling after the operation.  I find myself about to launch into how i really feel but remember that she thinks I had my appendix out.  I side-step and she catching me letting me know that she asked and its my own fault it i don't take the opportunities.  Maybe she is right.

She's just been talking to Ma, who says she hasn't heard from me in a while but that then she laughed saying that that can't be a bad thing.  Her sense of humour has returned.  She must be in good form if she is remembering.  My sting of guilt is alleviated momentarily.  Mary thinks she should start taking Aricept.  I don't agree, I think it will make her worse.  She tells me the statistics.  Normally I love statistics, shielding myself in them.  Today, I persist in my disinterest and denial, anxiously scribbling down the name of the drug.  She tells me Chris is ill.  'I know' I tell her.  'I'm flying home tomorrow week and Ma wants to see him, why don't you think about whether you want to come or not'.  'I can't, I'll be working and I can't take any more time off'.  'We can go at the weekend'.  She won't give up.  'We can always go down and we can drop you in a pub somewhere in town while we go out and visit'.  I laugh, 'Than might be a plan' I respond.

I ask her what she's up to 'Not a lot' she responds.  I tell her about my recent work do.  I liken it to an old relatives wedding anniversary or birthday celebration without the 'celebrity'.  So dismal in fact that I left without finishing my 'drinks tokens', using my last threads of interest at the bar allowing the bar tender to mix an impotent mixture of tia maria and vodka to no avail.  She finds this hilarious, the concept that I would pass on free alcohol.  It is quite comical but I can't muster the humour tonight.

She says we can meet for a drink anyway even if I don't want to visit Chris, and that considering the state of both our hectic social lives it will be something for both of us to look forward to.  

I make a mental note to call home tomorrow after I hang up and think about Chris briefly.  I'm not quite sure what I feel and put it out of my mind.  Maybe I will log onto the trust's site again tonight.  Its makes me feel less tired, the idea that I might be doing someone some good."

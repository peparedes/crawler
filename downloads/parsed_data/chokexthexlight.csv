It sucks when one of your favorite bands is a tremendous letdown.
I dont really feel like writing.
I just thought Id share that with you though.


[Post Script]: Straylight Run is now officially one of my favorite bands. Exsistentialism on Prom Night - One of the best songs ever written."

"event","Last night was the funnest, craziest, most adventurous night Ive had in quite some time.

The day starts with school.
What a drag.
But after school I went to scotts and we chilled untill we left for the concert.
On the way there I was flashing other motorists with my man boobies. It was quite amusing.
The show was amazing. Dashboard Confessional was...Orgasmic thats the only way to describe their performance. 
After the show we are driving home and scott was like I have to take a shit.
Yeah, So we went to his dads store in D-Town so he could poo.
But when he comes out of the bathroom he gets like really sick all the sudden and his lips swell up about 4x bigger than they should be. 
So he takes a shower to see if that would help. And we leave.
On the way home we run into torrential rains.
Every road is flooded and- oh my scotts dads car stalls.
And It wouldnt start for over an hour. 
Me and Bobby had to go out into the rain and the water flooded up to my knee and push the car to some little convience store.
Where it still wouldnt start for a half hour.
It was kinda fun playin in the rain though.
So I didnt end up getting home untill 2:30 and then gettin to bed untill 3:00 cause I had to eat something.
The upside is my mom let me skip school :) .

Blink 182, Taking Back Sunday, and The Used is tonight. I can only imagine what adventures this one will bring.


Im going to go call scott and see if he went to school or not.

-The only broken hearted loser...




(P.S. I got a Security guard named Tiffany to autograph my chest. It was awsome. haha.)"

I dont really want to.
But Sarah told me to so I will.
Today was boring.
The school was like empty because of Senior Skip Day.
Lunch was fun.
But Sarah punched me in the face AND made me cut my arm.
Geeze.
For no reason to.
Anyways now im just sitting here bored as hell.
Nothing to do.
Noone to hang out with.

I wish everything was ok.
But its not.
It sucks when people dont turn out to be who you thought they were.
It sucks even more when you lose the people you care most about.



It's so nice sitting very still,
in a room where no one else can feel the pain that breaks my heart each day, I'm not ok.
Sunlight shining through my window, let's me know that I'm still alive
Why did I ever let you inside my heart? I'm such a fool.
Paint my face in shades of blood and grey and take a seat right next to me
Well I should've known that you were a killer.
But now I'm dead.

A gaping hole, shot through my heart
A lost connection from your poison dart
Shot from your tounge to end my life.
You're blowing at the fire to light your strife.

You'll never know.
The hardest thing about dying is, knowing you'll never see the light of day.

A gaping hole shot...(shot through my heart)
A lost connection from your poison dart.
My head now spins and my ears bleed gold.
I try so fucking hard, but I can't fit your mold.

You ripped my heart out, you tore my eyes out, now you're gonna pay
I'll stab you one time.
I'll eat your heart out so you feel my pain.
Don't you know that I always see you in all of my dreams?
I wanna kill you. I wanna kill you. Now i'm insane.



















Ive just got to accept it.
The time we spent was great.
Too bad we couldnt have had something more.
Goodbye, My love."

Oh yes, lyrics a grand.
Especially when they mean something to you.



Last night I had a dream that we went to Disneyland, Went on all the rides, didn't have to wait in line. I drove you to your house where we stared up at the stars I listened to your heartbeat as I held you in my arms. We hung out at the rainbow where we drank til' half past two. Nothing could go wrong anytime that I'm with you. Like crashing a hotel room or leading up to that first kiss Or searching for a high school that you know doesn't exist... These are the things that make me free I feel like I'm stuck in ""stand by me"" This night was too good to be true. Today I woke up alone wishing you were here with me, I wanted us to be something that we'd probably never be. Today you called me up and said you'd see me at our show, But now I'm stuck debating if I even wanna go. Whitney, don't you understand that what I say is true? I just want you to know I have a major crush on you. I'd drive you to Las Vegas and do the things you wanna do I'd even have Wayne Newton dedicate a song to you. I only wish that this could be Just dump your boyfriend and go out with me I swear I'd treat you like a queen

Im on a roll here.
This weekend has been extremely mundane.
Oh well though.
I lose.
Last night was cool,
talking to some sweet people.
But not great.
It kind of made me lonely.
But again, I lose.


I love this song. The lyrics remind me of myself like whoa:

One by one
The children laugh and stare
At the boy down the road that nobody knows and nobody cares
He doesnt look like the rest of them
Cause he won't dress like the rest of them
Nobody cares about the boy on Northman Street

In between the light of day
He wants more than anything
In between the light of day
To find his way out of here

Dinner conversation
Passes him right by
No one cares about his stories they call them lies
Dreams he'll find his way
Dreams of being on stage
Nobody cares he's finding his was up Nothing Street

In between the light of day
He wants more than anything
In between the light of day
To find his way out of here
In between the light of day
He thinks he's going to make it
In between the light of day
If he could only take it

This is the time
This is the place
We all go our seperate ways
No turning back
This is the time
This is the place
We all go our seperate ways
No turning back
No turning back
No turning
Your going to be a star someday
Your going to be a star someday
You tell me
Someday
You tell me




---One day."

The memorys and feelings a single photograph

That is in the past.
I moved on a long time ago.
Im better off this way.

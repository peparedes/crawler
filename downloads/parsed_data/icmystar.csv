and she replied "" why do you ask me?, I'm only sad, but he...he's gone.. he's the one you need to help.. bring him back, bring him back please."" 
And I just sat and stared at something, anything, as though it held a hidden solution.. 
And she sat there at home, just thinking ""oh, I'm only sad, but he is gone, someone help him, bring him back oh bring him back please!"" 
But what could be done? I am only human and so was he. 
But she, she was crying and it broke my heart. 
""I don't want you to feel like this, ..."" I began to say. 
""No, it's not me,, I don't need to be comforted... I am here but he...he's not, I don't need help but he does.. someone please bring him back..!"" 
Silence was all we heard, and then... only the sounds coming from the city."

"event","Well here I am, remembering I have a livejournal. I feel funny writing here, just because it makes me remember who I was when I first started writing in this journal and I have really changed a lot lot lot.. Actually, it's not that I changed, it's just that everything around me changed and I just had to adapt.  I think all of us go through that. Right now, I am going through a very tough moment because I lost my relationship with God, and I can't trust myself to be able to handle my life on my own. 
Academically, I never really thought I would  fail a whole year in school, and here I am, embarrassed and mad at myself for wasting my time and not doing what I was supposed to do. Which is really the only thing I have to do.
But the worst part is that not only did I fail in school, I also disappointed God with my life,  and literally acted like I didn't know what he wanted me to do. 
I'm not a little kid anymore, I should take the right decisions even though everyday it becomes harder, when I was 13 I didn't have to deal with cigarrettes, beer, sex and drugs thrown right at my face, and cultural events promoting sexual diversity right in the middle of town, I'm so shocked, but I guess it's just part of growing up. 
Pray for me if you read this."

And I guess that's like a good thing. </P>
<P>And now when I read everyone's Livejournals I just think I wish I was there too.. I miss my friends, I wish I still talked to some people and I think I would have liked to keep so many friendships...that's like so hard, because it's never really the same. I'm just glad I still get to read what everyone is doing and your thoughts which is like so important to me......I'm here ""watching""&nbsp;all of you grow and change.</P>

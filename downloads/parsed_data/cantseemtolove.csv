"event","becky IM'd me ealier today and informed me i have 19 days left until i reach 40 weeks. I didnt even know, i've been so busy trying to keep my mind off the fact that Paul's gone and he may not be here for Arianna's debut into the world that i forgot about the countdown. I havent felt any contractions, no ""baby dropping"",nesting none of that shit. I feel like i'm broken when it comes to this whole third trimester prepareness. I havent even taken a class to help with my breathing. I'm going to walk into this whole labor thing just like my daughter, completely fucking clueless, just doing what comes naturally. 

 So here i sit, 4 in the morning, doing a mental check list and trying to figure out why in the hell i havent done the things i should have done before now. Right now i should just be waiting around, or doing finishing touches on her room. But NOOO, i'm waiting on everything to get here via mail.

I feel like a bad mother already and shes not even out of me yet. 





On another note, yesterday my family and i slept under one roof for the last time in Va. They were suppose to leave for their new home on saturday but the car (the blue escort) broke down and they ended up buying a new truck and not leaving until monday. I personally was hoping that they would change their mind or i would wake up and it all would just be a dream. At least the kid in me was hoping for something like that to happen. The adult side of me was ready for goodbyes. The adult side was ready not to cry or even pretend it effected me. Deep down inside i felt more alone when they pulled out of my apartment complex parking lot than i have ever felt in my whole life.

 Its different moving out and not being too far away. Relying on that false sense of security that if anything happened i could always run back to mommy and daddy. When i got sick i could just hang out at their house and they would baby me. But i also know they if they didnt move i would have never attempted to be an adult. Just pretended. I'm a wife,about to become a mother and i've been  just following the motions of this whole ""Adulthood"" journey. Always calling them for help if i ever got confused or if things felt too real.I still need them, and i know they will be there if anything happens to me, but i need to be strong enough not to use them as a back up plan and just live life.



P.S

 I'm sick, someone please love me back to good  health."

"event","So i have REALLY bad heartburn, i was asleep around 10ish, slept for a little bit then had to get up and pee.
Since then i havent been able to sleep. also another complaint.
Paul has started snoring REALLY bad. i mean like i dont want to be in the bed with him once he starts up. i wish he would either sleep on his stomach or sides but never on his back. when he sleeps on his back i fight the urge to stick my finger in his mouth when he starts snoring.it wouldnt be so bad but he wakes me up when he starts up.
Now i know i used to snore REALLY bad but he knew that from  jump street. and now i dont even snore that bad if any at all, i'm too busy grinding my teeth.

i'm sleepy, i didnt get to bed until 4 in the morning yesterday,even then i slept on the couch like i'm doing tonight.

i hate heartburn.
i hate not having anything to take for it.
theres only so much water you can drink until you make yourself sick."

"event","(this is an email i sent to paul.so the you is paul dorks)
I dont feel like going into ALL of it but the part that bothered me the most was:
 during the dream we were fighting, i mean hardcore fighting, it was because you hit me in the chest then you threw something at me. I just lost it,i started packing my shit and the whole time you were just fighting with me. I would stop packing just to throw punches at you or yell in your face. i remember saying "" i told you, you hit me i'm gone."" i called some people to help me move my shit out. And when they got there they saw us fighting and one of your punches landed in my face. They grabbed you and held you down while i went outside and started putting stuff in their car. After everything was packed i started crying really hard and looked down at my hand and saw my wedding rings. I looked up at you and you were crying and i said ""i never wanted us to end."" and you sobbed and said you didn't either but you put your hands out and i handed you the rings. 
 the next part of the dream i was at work in a library and it must had been a while that we werent together because when you came into the library you stared at me for a little and smiled. but it was a sad smile, it broke my heart really, and you sat down and we started talking, and right before we were done talking i went to hug you and i just stared at you, almost about to kiss you but i asked "" is this it? are we over?"" and you said ""i dont know,do you want to be?"" and i couldn't say anything. I wanted to, inside i was screaming but words couldn't get out. and you lowered your head and said "" i guess i should put our rings away"" and you kissed my forehead and lowered your head.
 
when i woke up i cried. i mean i felt all those feelings i had in my dream.i dont know , i just couldn't shake the feeling all day."

"event","i have issues with people telling me they are going to do something then not doing it or guilting me into letting them get away with not doing it.


the real reason is because in my family people say they are going to do shit for you all the time.
you depend on them.
you wait for it.
and when you finally get tired of waiting and you ask them whats up or it comes down to the last minute and you're expecting them to help out.

they dont.
they bitch.
they lie.
they make you feel like shit.
make you feel unimportant.

i love my family but i have to have a back up plan all the time when it comes to them.
I.E
""We'll put together Arianna's room. dont worry about that, we'll buy everything""
its august.
shes suppose to be here in october.
they still havent put a dime on her stuff yet.
they are going to wait till the last minute and then back out.
and i think i would just give up on them if they do.
that little girl inside of me doesnt want them to fail me.
that little girl inside of me wants them to come through on this one thing.
but the adult me is just waiting for that dismissal of feelings.
because i blow things out of content.
they dont ALWAYS back out.
they have a life too.
they did come to some of my events but with four kids its hard to be at everyone of them.(they never came to one goddamn thing. Even when i played tennis, the home courts were a 3 minute walk away)
i'm just a spoiled brat that wants them to still take care of me.




i still have issues with trusting people.
if paul says ""we're going out tonight"" and he tries to back out, a part of me dies. Its because i trust him so much and when he does things like that, each time a piece of that trust dies and that little girl inside of me cries."

"event","you have been working long crazy hours all week and i totally understand.
but i thought since it was friday,we got paid and we havent been able to spend anytime together you would want to do something.
you said you did,but right now you're asleep,you were asleep at 630. I try really hard not to be a bitch and to be understanding but theres only so much someone can take. I dont think you're being fair to me. I'm not working, and you take the car, so that means i'm at home all by myself until you come home which is around 9pm. You want to shower possibly eat dinner and go to sleep.
Damn the idea of sex,
damn the idea of talking to me or spendings at least alittle bit of time with me.
damn it all to hell.
its what you want.
its always about you.
and i have no one else to blame but myself.

I suggested a nap before we went out since you fell asleep while we were at my parents house (mind you we were only there for 10 minutes tops and that was because traffic was backed up and you didnt feel like waiting.)
but you're pretty much done for the night.

Great.



I dont understand how you can act so old sometimes. You never want to go out, you never want to do anything with anyone else because you think everyone else is stupid and when we actually do click with another couple you act weird. You have to be really loud whenever we are out somewhere with people from you boat. I wish you could just be yourself around everyone. the person i know, not this goofy white guy that needs the attention on him at all times.

My teeth hurt really really fucking bad and i'm watching NEXT.
 With that being said I want the MTV channel LOGO. 
Gay movies,gay music,gay everything!
And everyone knows I'm a total fag hag so I'm all for it.
I have a really bad headache and it only seems that it doesnt throb 
when i'm drinking water. GODDAMNIT I could punch something right now
my fucking teeth wont stop hurting.
Yeah this whole post is about nothing. 
I wanna learn how to knit it would give me something to do during the day.
The people on the show NEXT are so fucking stupid.
The guys only look for the dumbest girls possible 
and the girls are looking for prince charming and lets
be honest people men are not going to go on a tv show 
to look for their future wife. They are looking for a dumb bitch
with low self esteem so they can get an easy lay and put their
face out there so they can have their 15 minutes of fame.
The fat girls NEVER get picked.LMFAO god the people they pick,
their father's should have aimed for their mother's chin.
I'm done. fuck it. i'm going to take some pills and pass out."

yes that means i'm never going to go to college, i'm never going to be a police officer, that means i'm never going to follow through with my dreams and goals. but it doesnt matter because i'm used to supporting everyone else's goals and putting mine on the back burner. No one forces me to do it, i just do it.I become everything everyone wants me to be.I honestly feel that i dont know who i am without someone telling me what i should be and i have no personality.I only have one friend that i'm able to see and do things with and her life is sorta fading out of mine. i'm happy for her, i love the fact shes following her dream. and she knows at any time she would need me i would drop everything i'm doing and be there for her. i just need more friends now. i dont see the point of showering until Paul calls me and tells me hes on his way home and thats not until 5pm. the rest of the day i'm watching tv  and hating the fact i have no one to talk to and nothing to do other than clean. I want to meet new people that enjoy the things i do but i dont want to upset him.
I want to feel important just like everyone else."

"event","And i'm bored out my fucking mind. I have no books, no music, and rarely a computer. I have little to nill of a conversation that doesnt end with fighting with paul and i'm on the rag. So this trip is start to piss me off. I love being here with him, and i love him, dont get me wrong, but i dont think he thought this whole trip out when he wanted me to come up here.
 hes in school in the mornings. which is fine, but i have NOTHING to do. he wont let me drive, so thats out the question. I dont have any books. And its only day two and the first day i waited in the car for him the next day he dropped me off at his sister's house. Mind you this is the sister i've never met before and she el preggo (like i want to be around pregnant women when i'm dying to convice him we are ready for kids.) I feel like a burden more than a girlfriend. His dad hates me, his mom is cool but she thinks i'm too young. Which is fine because well i am only 19. But thats off topic here. 
 So tonight we're suppose to go shoot pool with his friends. Which means i'm going to stand there and look ""pretty"", because i'm the youngest, i dont drink, his friends have no sense of humor (minus dario, because hes pretty funny) and i just dont understand why i feel thatCurtis (or is his name marty) is trying to read me. 
  We stay at his parents house, which is cool but i know his dad hates me. OH OH OH did i even mention the fact that he is trying to go out to sea now instead of moving to Ca? all because he wants to stay in Norfolk. Eh, i dont know what to say about that, i could be mean and spitful about it all. Mainly because i've put my fucking life on hold for him and then when it gets closer to the moving date he tells me that we may not be moving to CA that he maybe going out to sea like this week.Can we say fucking pissed off? yeah that was me, he sprung it up on me and i know i'm the girlfriend and i'm suppose to just take this shit but goddamnit, this is relationship i think you should at least tell me when you plan to change things up on me. eh well i talked to him about it and we're at an understanding. His career comes first, he comes first. I can work with the left over time from that.I feel like i'm becoming a bitter old woman before i even get a fucking ring on my goddamn finger.
  Now let me explain, i'm not pushing him to get married. Infact i told him from the jump that he wasnt going to marry me that i was just his rebound girl from his ex wife. but he kept swearing differently. Well we're at our 4 month mark, and i'll say about a few weeks ago he asked me to marry him, i told him dont ask me to marry you and take it away. If you're asking me its because you want it, not because you think i want it. Well anyways not even a fucking week past and he was already recanting his proposble. I cant say i was pissed, well ok fine that would be lying i was pissed. and hurt.and confused.and heartbroken. I told him how much marriage meant to me, how i only want to get married once, and thats it. He understood that i was/is ready to start a family. And he still asked me to marry him,and by him asking me to marry him he was telling me yes i want to spend the rest of my life with you, yes i want you to be the mother of my children, yes you are the last woman i ever plan to be with.  So when he took it back, that was pretty much taking everything else back. well it was in my eyes. and the relationship hasnt been the same since. because he say things in the heat of the moment ( not sexually people. more like spurr of the moment) and then when he gets time to think about what he just said he wants to take it back. I refuse to be an emotional doormat for anyone. I refuse to be anyones game. thats what i feel right now, that hes playing games with me.eh whatever. 

yeah ok so iranted about a bunch of shit but really i love him, please dont get me wrong on that. i love him so damn much it hurts. its just that sometimes his method of thinking is slightly screwed. (at least in my eyes) and we butt heads because i have to make him see things from my point of view.i dont think he likes that too much, because at first i used to just do whatever he said, whatever he wanted to do i would do it. now i'm like -fuck it- i think i should give him more time to adjust and not judge him so hastly.


ok end of rant. i'm going to go take a shower now."

Like he says things that he knows would upset me. I'm not saying I'm an angel out of this relationship. 
 Its just that right now i'm having doubts about this move. I hate doubting myself, i dont know if the only reason why i'm so gunhoe about going through with this move is to prove everyone wrong or is it because i truly cant see myself without him.

I'm not going to lie, i dont want to give up on us. I see a strong future, i see us together ten years from now. I'm just scared that i'm the only one really serious about this relationship.






<b> Side note</b>

I'm sick, my tummy hurts. I'm blaming it on the milk i had this morning.
I dont feel like cleaning up, i dont feel like doing dishes, i dont feel like cooking, all i feel like doing is just laying in bed and throwing myself a pity party. I think i'm going to do that. Hes going out with his friends and my friends all have lives and they already pushed me out of theirs. So yeah i'm at home.
 I need to get some boxes
 I need to get my ID
 I need to do my hair
 I need to wash my clothes 
 I need to pick out the ones i dont wear anymore
 I need to finish things i start
 I need to stop thinking about chris.
 I need to stop thinking about my past.
 I <s>need</s> want Paul here with me right now."

Z finally told me today. But Z said she only knows that mom said i'm picking Paul over Z. I asked my mom as soon as she got home and my mom said that i cant take care of Z by myself and shes not letting me have her for a summer inless shes able to come out there too. My mom also said that she didnt say i'm picking paul over Z, just that i'm picking my friends over the family yet again and she doesnt want Z growing up thinking thats ok.

3) Last Name Spelled Backwards:  akreveV

4) Your Half-Birthday: i had no clue what the fuck that was so i looked it up and this is what i found -
 A half-birthday is a day exactly six calendar months before or after the real anniversary of a person's birth, and is therefore just one of that person's many unbirthdays (to use Lewis Carroll's term) -- any day that is not their real birthday.

Loosely, a ""half-birthday"" can also be a day that occurs near a person's birthday but at a much more convenient time. Someone whose real birthday occurs in late September, for example, may choose to celebrate it as a ""half-birthday"" together with his or her family during the Thanksgiving holiday.

Most half-birthdays go uncelebrated. Perhaps the most common usage comes from people whose birthday falls near Christmas, a holiday so widely celebrated that it can overwhelm private anniversaries. In the United States, young children sometimes celebrate their half-birthdays as well as their birthdays if their real birthdays do not occur during the school year, so they can celebrate with their friends and teacher(s) at school. <b> mine would be May 12</b>

I get in the shower no later than..: whenever i feel like it
I wash my ____ first.: my face
And I wash my ____ last.: eh, well i have two different loofas - one for the body and feet the other for the cooter so it depends on what needs to be done to the cooter (I.E shaving...)
I'm usually on the computer by..: whenever i'm bored

I usually spend _____ on the computer.: eh, monday through thursday - 85% of the day.friday through sunday -nil

As For Today..

Listening to..: my mellow play list

Getting angry about..: having everyone tell me that i dont do anything in this house. Then i would want to get out of the house but i have no where to go because everyone else have real jobs while i'm stuck in limbo about this move. So then i will get depressed about waiting around for the move, so that will force me to think back to that stupid bitch ashley saying that he isnt going to marry me because i'm not pretty and i'm fat. so i will then begin to feel extremely fat and very not beautiful and i will more than likely begin to cry, which will make me throw up because i hate crying but i will keep it all to myself and tell everyone i had a great day.because after all, nothing really important is happening in my life and who wants to hear about my move or my relationship,which are the two most important things in my life but no one supports me in my final desision.

"event","I've never felt this way before. 
I've never loved someone so much it hurts.
I've never thought about someone this much before.
Every waking moment hes on my mind.
I've never felt like I was going to cry at the thought of not being with someone.
Just hearing his voice makes my heart beat faster.
His lips, aganist mine actually makes me weak.
Its more than sex, its more than just a ""boyfriend"" 
Hes the one I was born to love
Before I used to watch romance movies and say to myself ""I want that""
Now I have it, and I cant stop smiling.
I'm so happy,so at peace. I never thought I would have this,now that I have it, I thank God everyday.
hes my soul mate. I love him. 
 At six in the morning, I finally realize that I'm in love. Truly in love. Everything about him i love. Even his flaws,his smile,his laugh, his touch,his frown,his body,his soul. 


There, I said it. Its all out there in the open. I've opened up myself completely.I love him and I'm at the point now that either you accept our love,our relationship or keep it to yourself because nothing anyone can say that will change my mind."

actually its either police,legal assistiant,lawyer (doubt paul would be thrilled to hear i'm going to go to college for that but o well). I know for a fact i'm not doing anything in nursing or medical for that matter. A - i dont like it enough B - my dad does that stuff C - all his ex's were nurses so fuck that. good thing i didnt want to be a nurse, because if i did then i would be like ""fuck it, i'ma just be another nurse in his book"" but no its not like that really. i really believe he loves me and i'm different than the others. heh, fucking stupid i know, but whatever let me continue lying to myself ok? i dont want to come off cloud nine right now.
I wonder what i would do if someone was like ""hey i went to middle school with you"" i would be like ""oh ok"" because if they remembered me then they were more than likely the kids i hung out with and i'm sure as hell not trying to dig up that part of my past.

A-had a dream i was living on campus with Becky and someone else.
but i went to school and some crazy ass shit happenend and i ended up seeing a serial killer kidnap a kid.well the police wanted me to go after the serial killer too because the serial killer was coming after me since i saw him and actually stopped him from taking the kid's brother.the first time we did this we were at the beginning of my street and the serial killer was in a black car without tinted windows and the cops were on Jerri's street where her dad parks. i had to hand over something the serial killer left behind, the only thing tying him to the case.well when i saw the kid my heart started beating faster and i went to hand him the shit and at that time i grabbed the kid, the cops was suppose to be my cover, but they didnt, so i was able to grab the kid and had to run, i ran around the block with the kid and the serial killer chased me. i wanted to run to my house but i didnt want to endanger my family so when the serial killer finally ran off i ran inside my house. my daddy and everyone else was there and my dad was all there holding me because i was so scared i couldnt control myself.
 well later that night after the police picked up the kid, we were suppose to have a detail watching our house, which made us feel safer so Z and my mom went to take out the trash and there was some teenage white boy fucking up our trash cans and tossing that shit around and he didnt notice mom or Z but by the time he did i was already upstairs and Yelled for dad to come down stairs and bring a weapon, for some odd reason i had a 9mm gun on my side, like a cop's gun and we both went outside and the teenager was telling my mom and Z how i fucked up his glory, he only took the kid because he found him, he really wasnt the serial killer and he wanted to turn him in with the stuff that i had on the serial killer, my dad was right behind me being my cover because it seemed like i had more training than him and he just listened to me, and when i went out there the kid flipped and grabbed for Z, well i pulled the trigger -having clear aim for his chest - and the the trigger jammed. my dad as my back up  came out and then all of a sudden the teenager  attacked my dad and thought he snapped his neck, while the teenager attacked i grabbed for Z and push my mom and Z to safety.
i went to safe my dad and the teenanger was bragging about how it didnt take much to kill my dad, just snap his neck. so when i went after him my dad was up already and was like ""next time make sure i'm dead"" and knocked the teenager out. crazy shit. my dad grabbed the teenager and pulled him inside, and i looked outside the fense, and saw that the teenager's car was outthere. and the first thing i thought about was he wasnt alone. so when we were all inside i hugged everyone, everyone was crying and stuff and i wasnt. my mom was on the phone with the police and when i asked if the door was lock as i was going to check on it the teenager in the middle of the kitchen (the one my dad knockedo ut) was waking up and then i heard some banging on the door, by the time i got there the door was locked and all in like 30 seconds i told my mom to knock the one on the floor out again and to have my dad cover me again, and told Z to get everyone and lock themself in a room upstairs. so when i turned back around from doing all that and locking the door, the perp outside was still pushing on the door and was almost in, i turned back around to check to see if my dad had my back, and of course, he didnt, he was backing away with a fucking coffee pot in his hand! then iturned around around to have a knife go through my fucking throat.
         then i woke up.

tried to go back to sleep, had a dream almost like the first one but only difference was that the prep in the car with the kid had a knife in the kid's leg so i couldnt grab him, but when i handed the prep the stuff he wanted he grabbed me and pulled me inside with him. so i'm side the serial killer's (now truck in this dream.orange ass old van/truck thing)and hes cutting me up, and i'm tapped up,gagged and bound. hes telling me all the shit hes gonna do to me and  the kid i was trying to save.and how he was gonna get away with it and he wasnt even gonna kill us, so he can always be a part of us.because we were our most challenanging victims for him yet.and i woke up hearing the child screaming, and i'm not going to say what he was doing.
so yeah, fuck my dream career. i'm re-thinking it all together.i'm so fucking scared right now something like that is gonna happen in my house.and my dad isnt even home. i'm scared some fucker is gonna break in and i'm the first one on this level of the house to get to if you break in from the front or back door. and i just made a pact with myself, if anything happens to me involving someone trying to kill my family and they get to my room first, i only want them to take me out, if theres a way to make my family not wake up and only have the killer kill me (or do whatever he wants to do) and leave, then i would try it,i dont want anyone in the house to get hurt. i dont even know why i'm fucking thinking like this. i'm going to sit in my room and prolly think about what ifs some more and cry."

"event","I've always wanted to be on real world, but lately that feeling has faded for many reasons,mainly because i dont have anything to offer to MTV. I mean sure i'm funny, and i would exactly call my background/family life normal,but that is about it. Its not like when/if i get on the show i will go into the confessional booth and talk about how my mother has lost her mind and my step father is white, how i fucked up my high school years and i've been in many abusive relationships. 
     also i've noticed that they havent had any ""real"" people up there. i mean yes its tv and no one wants to look at normal people that you could see everyday, you want to see a hot 5'6 skinny hooters girl getting out of a shower, not a 5'3 chunky pushing fat mixed girl getting out of the shower...no,no one wants to see that. You dont want to see a 19 year old girl that is mature for her age and is ready to start her life. What the public want to see is a 19 year old fat girl who dates outside of her race because she isnt attracted to black males and the reasoning behind that is because she has never had a real posivite black male in her life...
          And thats not me. 
I'm happy with my life (To a point)
I'm happy with the choices of who i date and who i fuck
I'm <i>happy</i> with my family
I dont have sob stories i'm willing to share with the world so they can feel sorry for me but hate me on the next eposide because i freely use racial slurs,smokes,loves to have sex and cuss like a truck driver on a bad day.




i dont know if this makes sense to anyone, its better if i explain it in person. not that it really matters, but its something to talk about and something thats been on my mind. i'm sure i'll still try out for real world because its been a little dream of mine (sick i know)."

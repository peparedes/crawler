You are a person of great enthusiasm - easily excited by many things.
Unsatisfied by the ordinary, you are reaching for an epic, extraordinary life.
You want the best. The best life. The best love. The best reputation.

You posses a sharp and keen intellect. Your mind is your primary weapon.
Strong willed, nothing can keep you down. Your energy can break down any wall.
You're an instantly passionate person - and this passion gives you an intoxicating power over others.

At your worst, you are a narcissist. Full of yourself and even proud of your faults.
Stubborn and opinionated, you know what you think is right. End of discussion.
A bit of a misanthrope, you often see others as weak, ignorant, and inferior.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattempermentareyouquiz/"">What Temperment Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Are you tired of all those sissy-ass ""friendship"" poems that always sound good, but never actually come close to reality? Well, here is a series of promises that really speaks to true friendship: 

1. When you are sad - I will help you get drunk and plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you sad. 

2. When you are blue - I will try to dislodge whatever is choking you. 

3. When you smile - I will know you finally got laid. 

4. When you are scared - I will rag on you about it every chance I get. 

5. When you are worried - I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to quit whining. 

6. When you are confused - I will use little words. 

7. When you are sick - Stay the hell away from me until you are well again. I don't want whatever you have. 

8. When you fall - I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass. 

This is my oath...I pledge it till the end. 

""Why?"" you may ask? Because you are my BEST friend.

Love ya

you in, and washes all the dirt off of you.   He opens you up, touches 
you deep inside and scoops out all the yucky stuff -- including the seeds of doubt, hate, greed, etc.  Then He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside you to shine for all the world to see.  
This was passed on to me from another pumpkin. Now, it is your turn to pass it to a pumpkin.   I liked this enough to send it to all the pumpkins in my patch.   Happy Autumn!"

So things arnt going really well right now.. Krelly and I arnt friends again.. I was board and I thought would read through her journal and I read all of the old entires and I couldnt help but cry.. We used to be so close.. And know we dont even talk.. I dont know what to do anymore.. I love her like she was my lil sister.. But I guess none of that matters anymore.. Because I guess are friendship is over.. She has moved on to other bestfriend.. But I will say this when I heard her say Say is my best friend I broke down.. I always tell peep she is my bestfriend I even tell Chelsee that she will never replace Kelly.. But who knows anymore... god why cant I stop crying.. I should be vrying she doesnt care.. why do I so much.. I tried calling her to see if she wanted to go get some food and so we could talk and maybe go to wally world.. But her phone said she wasnt reciving calls..at this moment.. so I'm home school now.. thank god I didnt know how much more of kokomo i could take...

So I been doing alot of think about my friendship with Kelly and well I relized that it has gone 2 shitz I was sitting and talk to John and we were talking bout how we missed the old her and the old her is so diffrent.But there really isnt anything that we can do to fix that. John was really upset with her this weekend but.. Who could blame him... I guess.. I mean in a away.. I dont know I'm staying out of there Drama.. But anyways.. Jonathan and I are still great! We spent the weekend together like the normal.. We stayed in Logan till Sunday and then Sunday we came back here and stayed the night.. So this past weekend we went to the land had a fire, went to Aarons to go camping and Friday we just went to the parkinglot and then Pete stayed the night.. But other than that we diddnt do that much.. So I can Drive AGAIN!! Thank-God I'm so excited.. So is mom she is sick of driving me everywhere.. and now I can drive up 2 see Jonathan and he doesnt have to drive down here so much..I feel bad by the way gas prices are.. But anyways...Well I dont have much more to say so I'm going to go... I mean I have alot but I dont want to say it on here because I dont want to leave it on a jounral insted of talking to here bout it... (Kelly yes bout you)

I see the philosophical holes in the fiber of that action. ""They"" say if you would say something differently if you were anonymous, that means some tweaking should probably happen in your life. And I know it should. Can't that be part of the tweaking.
Anyway I seem to have a thing for typing and self-absorption. Right?

Anyway the art thing is working out decently. Lemme throw this factoid out there: I don't actually care about the art world as much as I'm supposed to.

I've been out of school for one year now. 

This is like throwing a rock in a well. Interesting."

I would just have been repeating myself if I kept posting. More art classes. More sinus infections. Juggled around the boyfriend situation. And now, I'm not interested in saying much about my life anyway. Katie the cat is fine. It is cold outside. 
Finals is in two weeks. and you know that I have procrastinated.
What would I say? This isn't an anonymous journal. I could whine about things. But I do that face to face quite enough.
My senior show is next semester. Then I'm done with school. THEN i'd say, oh, I applied here, oh, I work here, doing this mundane thing, and I write poetry still, and it is also something I will not connect with this journal.
Uhm. I bought an mp3 player? No news, can't help you.
But this isn't an entirely negative post. I like my life."

I HATE THE FILE BACK UP PROGRAM ON MY HP LAPTOP.
It has been telling me to back up files, which I do myself, using this irremovable program, and won't let me turn off the reminder settings. There is only one option on the options panel: back up your files. I hate it. Why don't I use it? Because, as I caved in today and backed up my files, it saves EVERYTHING from my cache, cookies, program files that come on every computer, even though there is a back up hard drive in the laptop itself. that's right, it comes with a back up hard drive that is now full anyway. I'm watching the back up RIGHT NOW, slowly putting every little gif and hidden file I possess onto what will be 15 cds. even entire programs that I got off the internet. like mozilla. it is stupid, and wrong, and slow, and will probably MALFUNCTION and overheat before the sixth cd!
PLUS when I back up my own things that I care about, that already takes hours upon hours.

I went to philosophy club again the other day. This time it was about superheros from comic books and their moral philosophies of either Utilitarianism or Deontology, with some comments of Leviathan ethics and such. Uh. At least I had read the book Watchmen. That kept me up on it a little. Otherwise it's a lot of fun.
They are going on a trip to Purdue to have this philosophy seminar thing. I will check my calendar about that one.

I'm sorting through a colossal pile of my mail right now.

I scheduled my classes. I'd have to sit here and remember what they are. Poetry 1, Painting 2, Drawing 3, History, Intro to Printmaking... uh. One more. Which is... aha! A Symposium in Physical Sciences, which is a big fat class over physics, astronomy, and chemistry. Wish me luck on that one.
I'm thinking about getting a job. Don't ask why, I'm so busy. Or. I don't know.

My sculpture at the last minute got removed from the show for room reasons, and my professor was furious because he said there's a lot of crap in there and he wanted mine in it. Luckily, I believe it.
What this art thing was was basically people touring all the galleries of Muncie; I went last year. My ceramics professors were doing some fancy raku firing in the street, my drawing professor was floating around, I saw lots of art. ross did a melted wax demonstration somewhere, i ran into people from classes. there was a professor exhibition thing.
i'm going to philedelphia, did I say that already? i'm excited, woot for the socializing and museums.
i do have one drawing in the show, it's more sketchy than all of the pieces in there but also pretty solid.
man, i went to say hi to a professor, he just talked to me with this smirk on. i went to the bathroom, discovered i had purple paint on my lips in such a stupid way.
i made sure to inform him he was evil.
what else- i'm working on still lifes, reading for classes, had a fever recently i've tried to snap out of.
tutoring has been interesting. we had to record the session then transcribe it. it's the funniest thing. his name's Devoun, he's a cool kid, a little quiet and we don't always communicate. heh.
think think. been reading lots of world literature for that class...
went to see a writer from university of alabama, he was ok, but not ... not great. the experience of being in a room of writers was good, some witty things were said, but not great.
uh, yeah, lemme think again. what does my life consist of.
watched a creepy movie with bunches of art people. it was actually pretty good.
someday these people are going to realize i can actually paint and am not covered in it just because i feel like it.
the writing thing is also going well, i am still trying to be a genius in that department as well.
doesn't look like it here, but what can you do. this is an update, that's good enough, right?
i can't remember what the heck i've been up to.
finished fellowship of the ring? that's always an interesting event.
it's been storming somewhat up here, a big one last night.
i'm about to rearrange my room; my bed is by that freezing window. which I like, until winter.
now, as for me, how am I, well I will say i'm pretty good, been thinking a great deal. got tired today because couldn't sleep, but was excited about art stuff. writing stuff, philosophy stuff.
made a cool french pitcher in ceramics.
can make my own canvases now, actually have to. that staple gun outwits me, though.
i wrote some poems? i liked 'em. happens. 
oh, and there were some big bands and jazz people playing downtown during ArtWalk.
why that matters, I know not. thought the scene needed some sound.
oh, and i've killed my feet, i've killed them dead, they can't take it any more.

Creative Writing: Also a cool professor. Went over syllabus, met people, basically we write creatively. Was woman professor. I was only relatively special bc lots of people like writing.
Math Tutoring: I was reeeaaaaally special. but I'm excited about the class! my little brain will learn a lot about how to tutor better among all these calculus mathy people.

And other stuff. It demands my time but doesn't have due dates.
Like the last bible study, and whatever else it is I do.
I have no time to even consider this summer.

On a different note, I am going to go see Brokeback Mountain tomorrow night. There is also a carnival but enh, movies are obviously better.
Yeah yeah, someone's going to talk me into going, I know that in advance.
So maybe I typed out that list for myself, maybe I didn't know what I had gotten myself into.

I am reading Speaker for the Dead... if anyone cares... I like it."

I admit today therefore started out badly because ... nobody cared and wanted to blame it on me that I finally for once left my swimmingsuit in the locker room. They didn't say that but it was there.
And then I slept and got over that- 
Pounded on plaster for hours with a chisel, going all Michaelangelo. 
It was a beautiful day.
I applied for the desk staff for next year, having to write a resume and about everything else- hope that works out.
I think I'll start packing now."

Hm. I recently forgot what I was going to say. I'm volunteering tomorrow morning at the nursery.
Uh... yeah art school is expensive. I gotta go to WalMart and Lowe's again.
Julia moved out Thursday. My roommate.
To make it looked lived in I put my art everywhere- it's my own personal gallery.
I went to an art gallery reception downtown-- my old drawing teacher's work. My new drawing teacher was there. He said my drawings were better than those guys-- that could have a little to do with the beer in his hand. He's the man.
I took an art history test that I did not study for. I was not feeling well that night. I'm getting better.
I checked out some awesome CDs recently- man. I love this New Age stuff sometimes. If it's done right.
My boyfriend is the cutest wootest weetle thing.

Took a long nap today. Denny was bored for hours because I was cuddling with my sleeping bag.
Watched X-files. Getting ready to watch some more. Maybe I'll take a music appreciation class just because Mulder took one. Oh, and for my mom- Scully has the exact metal plant waterer thingy on her table. You know. It's interesting. They're old-fashioned.
Last week it was pouring and Denny and I ran back to the dorms in the rain. It was great. The sky was falling-- after the art show thingy that weekend that I can't remember if I mentioned.

Great moments in life: Making someone scream because they were singing a song that they hate that you just got stuck in their head.

I decided after all of these art galleries and students trying to express themselves, the world would be a better place if it just listened to me. No ego involved, just pure truth.

The Truth is Out There. I Want to Believe."

I helped load tiles in the big kiln the other day- that thing was huge and everything was heavy. I was trying not to be a sissy.
Hm. And I got an A on my wood sculpture. OH MY GOSH it's OVER!!! A- on craftsmanship. Yeah. Big deal.

I am so tired. I could not sleep last night. But dinner was great. Pot roast! My hero. 
OK OK so I can never think of what I did. It's early. Well-- the other day Captain Dr. Williams spoke to our class about his service as a doctor in Afghanistan where he checked up on basic medical procedures in the country's hospitals. He said there was often a lack of resource use- educated physicians often worked as translators because they make six times more money that way, and women took a while to agree to be seen by a doctor. The Taliban prohibited the work and education of women-- there were no midwives, and male doctors weren't allowed to physically help with childbirth. One had tried to yell through the door at a female helper on what to do. He said many deaths were caused because he could not see what simple things were occurring and his helper could not identify them."

Woke up early, felt great, snuggled the blanket, went to go take a shower,
COULD NOT FIND MY STUDENT ID (therefore not get into the bathroom)
 Then I found my stupid ID forty minutes later. I was supposed to have been to class an hour early to write this paper. But I bought some great mushy nutri grain thingies and got here...
I FINISHED THAT PAPER and it was just spectacular. 
I... found a solution to LIFE.

yesssss. take that.

Today is still going to be WAY too long until Denny gets here and then it will shorten and I will be grumpy about that.
But nonetheless. If I lived through this morning I can live through anything. School-wise. Stress-wise. Not in the tragedy category or anything.

Ach. You have no idea how disciplined I'm being.
At seven we're eating dinner as a little New Orleans people group. Which means it's probably a huge group.
Then I'm going to see a French movie... then I am writing a paper... 
I have got to be incredibly buff. In swimming it's about the same as going to the weight room for half an hour considering what we do,
then I definitely use every heavy thing an artist can get ahold of. Then carry it home.
Even this keyboard is so sticky my fingers are getting a workout.

I actually like my sculpture but now that I'm cutting and sanding plexiglass I've been irritated at it. Grr! My skin is covered in chlorine, plexiglass bits and sawdust! 
And I got an A- on my last photoshop project. Yay. This is the ""I don't give A's"" guy from Vietnam. Which I realize he just tries to make people work for them. 
Well I'm in that class now so. 
MAN I am tired. Only because I overslept through my breakfast. 
Well... this Friday I am going to finally see Fun with Dick and Jane for FREE! Free is great for college students.
And I have taken up the hobby of watching X-Files. I never watched it when it actually was being aired (too scary). It's great! Denny is bringing me more episodes. Apparently my library stopped after the first four. As IF they are not educational or something.
Currently reading a novel about colonial Zimbabwe. Those Brits think everybody should be Brits.
I'm supposed to be designing a CD cover for any band. I think I will dress myself up as a singer even though I can't sing. At least it will prove my photograph is original.            ...cough.
see? this is why I don't update. unless you want to hear about pointless things, I can't help you.

I've got some midterms to study for, pretty much. 
Today in swimming we listened to a relaxation tape in a yoga room, I guess to introduce us to the idea.
Hm. Mardi Gras at the buffet tonight, everybody in clown costumes. It was crazy. Fake jello shots. Shrimp.
Ash Wednesday tomorrow, Oklahoma! (the musical) Thursday... Some big exams...
We're watching ""Osama"" in globalization, but it's not the Osama bin Laden. It's depressing. Everything we learn about the middle east is depressing. And if it's not, some clan comes along and blasts it away.
More woodshop. Spending my savings at Lowe's. 
Getting some reading done.
There's a big health test tomorrow- why did I take that class my senior year. It was so pointless compared to this. This stuff has a point.
I think.
We're doing scribble drawings in drawing. Why is it ALWAYS something that I can't stand doing for more than an hour that I ALWAYS have to do for three hours three days a week for about 7 weeks?
Oh and somebody finally responded to the sign outside my door and wants a portrait done. Yes. I am the woman.

I had my little binoculars (or Denny's) and knew all of the songs- he didn't do too many compared to most concerts, but that's ok. He sat in a chair- said, ""You be thinking old BB is bout too old and has to sit down-- and you'd be right."" He was still energetic. He talked a lot, which was great. 

And. let's see. Did you know you're supposed to get new shoes every 500 miles or 6 months? The professor said when the soles get wrinkly on the sides sometimes that can mean the soles are compressing. I'm still cheap though. Our professor also helped write the book we're using. 

Uh. And my throat only hurts when I haven't been eating or drinking or something for a while, so usually after I wake up or go to sleep. Otherwise I'm fine and did well in swimnastics yesterday. Geez! We used these styrofoam ""weights""- underwater- and it was hard! She said we're going to keep using them because of their effectiveness. So that's how she sees it.

I'm supposed to be doing a photoshop project about range of emotion, roughly. How about sickliness. That's an emotion. I have sources for that.
Denny having strep AND mono. Happy Valentine's present for a week well ill.

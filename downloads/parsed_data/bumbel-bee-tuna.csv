And I can't take it yeah I can't shake it
Nooo

I can't wait to see you
Want to see if you still got that look in your eyes
That one you had for me before we said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we got to spend our time
Being mad about the same things
Over and over again
About the same things
Over and over again
Ohh
But I think she's leaving
Ooh man she's leaving
I don't know what else to do

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When i said that i would leave
you was too damn stubborn to try to stop me or say anything
But I see clearly now 
And this choice I made keeps playing in my head
Over and over again
Playing my head
Over and over again
Ohh

How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it.......





I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin 
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin 
It's been proven, MY LOVE U ABUSEIN
I can't understand, how a man got you choosin (yeah) 
Undecided, I came and provided ma 
My undivided, you came and denied it (why?) 
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (I know when you lyin) 
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin (stop cryin) 
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know 
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go) 
And I don't wanna let you leave 
Can't say I didn't let you breathe 
id Give you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in  SUV'z 
if You wanted ice id make you freeze 
Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right) 
Now it's time you invest in me 
Cause if not then it's best you leave 
Holla, yeah 




Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, NEVER TRUST A FEMALE ON NO SCALE YOU JUST CONFIRMED THAT ......
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a RUTHLESS CHICK......"

""sometimes i think will is my true love""....""i love u""........those are jst some of the words that i cant stop thinkin about that jst keep playin over and over again how could she do this to me.... all i evr waz waz good to her yeah i faught w. her but she could have fuckin xed this shit and didnt.... and yea i promised i would never leave her but wtf am i suposed to do0 sit there and share her?? nawl not happenin thekid startight out told me he wazant goin nowhere unless amber herself told him to leave and i said back to him she to stubborned to leave and he waz like nalw its b.c she dont want me to leave deep down amber knows she wants me and knows were gunna be togeather....... and all im thinkin is damn hes right......like i dunno0 wat i did she said i made her unhappy like wtf did i do0 beside fight w. her about will...... now she cant even say nuttin b.c she knows she could have fixed us and she chose him over me ..... so0 i let her go0 i had to i made her unhappy and she wanted to be w. will wat am i suposed to0 do0 it waz the worst decision of my life and i know she wont see this b.c its a journal and she dont know i got one and to be honest i dont care if she reeds it like but foreal i jst dont know wat im gunna do w. out her i need her in my life...... but the only way imma get over her....not sayin i want to0 but its wat she wants.... i gotta stay away from her  i love her to0 much to see her hurt..... and i told a few perople about this and they all told me i waz fuckin stupid for still being w. her after she told me she wanted him in her life....but i jst brushed itand delt w. it..... and im an idiot 4 it...... i swore i would never get liek this over a grl i swore it and then she came like i dunno0 wat to do0 maybe its best that i left she'll be happy w. will and ill be misserable 4 a long time till i get her outta my head but its worth her bein happy .......look at me im still worryin about her more than myself and i dont even go out w. her........ u know be4 last night i use to think that the last 5 months wasnt a waste  and that they made us stronger..... and then lst night i felt like all 5 months went down the drain .....b.c i really felt like she loved me...... but i guess i waz wrong b.c if u love someone u dont do0 that....... but yeah thats how im feelin today and boiis wanan throw me a goin back into the wild bittie party to get my mind off her but i cant..... nothings gunna make me forget about her i love her way to much but ya know............ u need both perople in the relationship to try and i felt like i waz the only one tryin said that i didnt even try i jst let her go0 like she waz some any otha grl......wat she dont realize is taht i been tryin the last 3 months w. her and wne she finally figures out how she can fix it she fuckin stabs me in the back.....and says oh i cant put him out.....fuck that hes ur fuckin past get over him u needa let him the fuck go0........ he had his fuckin chance...... he blew it i wanted my chance to have amber to mysself and not have to worry about her goin out and him bein there and tryin something w. her and i could have gotten taht chance yesterday ...but now i c she never wanted me to have that chance..... im sry but thats how it is.... i love her and didnt wanan loose her but she loves him and wants him in her life so0 fuck it i had to do wat i had too0 do0..... i didnt get no sleep last night i stayed up cryin and throwin up all night  and i dont wanna be like this..... so0 please HELP!!

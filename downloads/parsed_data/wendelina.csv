"event","so i feel like a piece of shit.

there was something that i HAD to tell my friend, and now my friend is really upset about it. but its better she knows now than if she found out later. and if she would have found out later that i knew a long time ago and didn't tell her.. yea, that would have been not good. i dont know, i would have wanted her to tell me.. man, i just feel like a bitch.

theres this hot guy. he wanted to hang out in yakima with me this weekend. gas is way too expensive, you could spend that money on beer instead. so i cant move up there until next weekend. what the fuck is that shit about?? we'll see.. im still going to try to make it happen.

why am i still awake?? its almost 2:30am!! i didn't sleep well last night. i just keep getting this really bad feeling that someone is setting a curse on me. that when i go to yakima, all hell will break loose, i'll get fat, and everyone will end up hating me. ahhh!! i hate school sometimes.

anyway, thats all i have to say. i wish gas didn't cost so damn much. and i wish i would stop thinking about my ex, all my toxic friends and the fact that i have to mow the fucking lawn tomorrow. man i hope i can move into the dorms on saturday. PEACE OUT!!"

if there's anything that i have realized in the past week, that would be it. i dont understand why i let myself cater to an immature asshole my entire year at yvcc. yes, i did deserve better. at the beginning of the relationship, it was awesome.. but towards the end, it got boring. i have just realized that i tried to make something work for 7 months that would have definetely failed in the long run. we just grew apart.. and as whitney huston would say, ""he wasn't man enough for me."" i will never forget the times we had, good and bad. i will never forget how he was the first guy that truly made me go weak in the knees. i will never forget how i felt when i was with him. so i'm going to put those memories in my little memory box and move the fuck on with my life. there is no sense in dragging this along any further. i may think i have found my Nemo.. but the truth is, there are way more fish in the sea.. and Nemo just gets lost all the time. why would i want a man who gets lost all the fucking time?? exactly. ohh but there is one more confession.. i dont think i'd be able to hook up with a guy for a long time. its just something that does not feel right at the moment. i could deal with flirting, drinking, and making out.. but sex is something totally different. im sure andrew has moved on, and thats perfect. but for me.. it's going to take awhile because i'm me, this is how i work. i just hope andrew stays out of yakima for the next.. year or so, because with him there and me there.. and me knowing it.. it's going to be hard to not call him up and ask him to stop by for a quick ""visit"" despite the fact that i hate him more than tapioca pudding. sad, but true. don't shoot me!! :)) 

i'm finally happy. this is the happiest i've been in a few weeks. finally, light at the end of the tunnel."

i feel so incredibly stupid for not listening to my friends and trusting the one guy that i really did have strong feelings for. did he lie to me? i feel like he did. i just don't understand how someone can be okay with that.. i really just don't understand.

i thought i knew you, andrew. how could you do me like that? how could you kiss me, hold me, tell me you want me in your life and then treat me like shit when you get the chance to prove it?? you really blew it this time.. i don't think friendship is even an option anymore with me. you have no idea how much that really breaks my heart to say that.

what happened to you.. i don't even know you anymore. you're not the same guy i fell in love with at the beginning of the year. i want him back!! 

i hate who you are now.

there's no future for anything. friends, more than friends, nothing. and i'm just realizing it today.. and i'm really, really sad about it but i think its the right choice. the only way i'll ever be friends with him again is if he apologizes everyday for a year, kisses the ground i walk on, and kisses my ass while he's at that. i'm fucking pissed... the song, ""look what you've done"" by Jet says it all..

"event","there are so many things that i loved about yakima.. meeting new people, taking new experiences with me and falling in love (or so i think). but these feelings are all bittersweet because yakima also reminds me of being hurt. every year, there has always been something.. douche bag guys, catty girls, sports, etc. but last year seemed to be worse than ever due to the fact that no one can keep their damn nose out of other people's business.. that and meeting people who say they are your friends, but then talk shit about you the moment you're not around (we all know who THAT is).

i've always been honest.. and it seems to me that making friends aren't really worth it.. well, in yakima at least. there are so many manipulative assholes that i met last year, friends that i don't talk to anymore and friends that i will never talk to anymore. i dont need friends like that.. i dont need dead weight in my life and no one really does.

but then there are those who have been there for me through thick and thin.. my friends that didn't place a judgement on me when they heard that lame ass rumor that me and jake had sex.. please.. i'm not that terrible of a person!! and if you think i am, don't ever talk to me again. dont even think about bringing it up, either. i want everyone to know that because of that situation, i am no longer friends with him and our friendship.. or whats left of it.. is completely and forever ruined. all because of shit talk. also, a big thanks to all of my friends who didn't tell me what to do about the whole andrew situation.. support was what i needed, and everyone knows if they dont like the advice they're hearing.. chances are they aren't going to follow it anyway!! i just wanna say thank you heidi.. you've always been one of those good friends to me. same to you, angie. i love you guys!!

now a new year is starting up.. and i'm getting teary-eyed. stupid places like the gas station or englewood street remind me of good times with andrew or smoking at the lookout with tommy. even walking past andrews room would probably make me cry. the same goes with all of my other friends, too. not seeing kc everyday is just going to kill me.. he was like a big brother to me. going to baseball games.. will be kinda tough, too. but i guess i can get through it by myself.

i just don't understand what it was that made me get so damn attached to last year.. i will remembre it always. but going back there and making new memories.. i dont want to. i'll miss it too much. and i dont want to even deal with the drama. fuck drama. i dont even want to be friends with any girls, either. girls.. and i should know, i am one.. are so dramatic about everything. the only girls i can probably stand are ashton, heidi, angie and bryttnee. all the rest can just stamp a big F on their forehead for eff off.

"event","i feel like i'm taking crazy pills!!

i never in my life thought i'd ever feel like a transient.. a homeless person.. never ever did i think i'd ever feel like that. these past few days.. past 4 days to be exact were the epitomy of hell for me. HELL!! 

my ride that took me up to yakima decided not to take me back, so i was stuck hanging out with people i normally wouldn't hang out with and a pocketful of.. lint?? that's right.. ran out of cash on the second day (didn't plan on being there for four). needless to say, i had to depend on my dear friend Bryttnee for advice, a place to stay and food. quite embarrassing, since i usually am the one that takes care of friends.. not the other way around.

anyway, Brytt had to leave on friday to go home, so i called my friend molly to see if i could stay at her place for the night.. no answer. so i called up megan, and we hung out, went to mcdonalds.. then she dropped me off at Rosauers to meet up with liz. liz and i hung out for awhile, went to jack in the box, and then headed towards the dorms to hang out with my friend brittany and her friend erika. biggest mistake EVER!!

we got to the dorms, met up with some boys.. the one brittany liked happen to like me, so he kept asking me to ""hang out"" with him.. well, brittany got really mad and started yelling at me and calling me a whore and whatever else she could. i think i remember her saying, ""wendy!! you've got andrew!! why the fuck do you need to be a selfish bitch and ruin everything!! i just broke up with my boyfriend.."" yaddy yadda yadda, he was talking to me, not the other way around. besides, he was way too young for me and im not looking for someone right now. anyway, erika managed to calm both of us down (i hit brittany in the head with my hand and told her to shut the fuck up and stop acting like a bitch), and we ended up ditching the boys at this campground they took us to. thankfully.. but not really.. we met up with this guy named chris (who brittany and erika knew) and this other guy.. i forgot his name. so we went down to the campsite.. and this other guy, while brittany was hooking up with chris, was hitting on me and we were just talking. then thats when brittany told chris i tried to, ""steal her crush"" earlier, so he grabbed his friend and was like, ""you shouldn't be sitting next to her.. sit next to HER!"" and shoved him up to erika.. anyway, needless to say, no one talked to me for the rest of the night. 

oh, and i ate a raw hamburger.. not to mention the four of them slept in a tent for the rest of that night while i slept in the back of brittany's car. it sucked balls.. all i did was cry and wish andrew was there with me. i swear, the highlight of my night was seeing that shooting star.. i've never seen one before.. anyway..

the next morning, brittany drops me off in front of the dorms and just leaves.. not even saying anything to me; i think it was like 6am. so i sat outside of the dorms for like an hour, then thankfully this girl comes and opens the door, so i headed upstairs to sleep in the tv lounge until 11am.. when my parents were supposed to get me. i could bore you with the rest of my story, telling you my phone was turned off, i lost it, and to top it all off the damn pay phone in the hall had the receiver messed up so i couldn't call collect to my mom back in tricities.

anyway, fuck yakima. and yet.. i have to go back on the 15th. but thats purely for andrew, and that should be fun. but fuck yakima. and fuck all of my so called friends.. yeah right, if you were really my friends you wouldn't have done all that lame shit to me. so i'm sorry if i delete you from my phone book!!

"event","okay, so about last night. last night was somewhat fun, kinda boring. i hung out with my friend Sara from highschool, and also with her friends AJ and Chelsea. We decided to have some fun and drink a little, so we headed over to my other friend's house, Annalenes. So we finally get there, say hi to Jason and Todd, then head over to Jason's house. After we bought some beer, we all sat there and talked about anything and everything.. mostly about me, and then watching Sara trip all over everything while AJ kept her away from the beer and put his arms around her.. it was kinda cute, and it really made me miss good times back in yakima with Andrew. 

so i drank a little more.. lol

..then Jason started hitting on me. Now.. i don't mean to be mean or anything, but it was absolutely disgusting. Not only did i mention the fact that i wasn't interested in meeting anyone right now, i also mentioned i'm going up to Alaska in about a month. Thank GOD we ran out of beer, so Todd and i headed to the store, which allowed me to kinda chill out from being hit on lol so we got back to Jason's, and he kept telling me how, ""hot"" my sayings were.. you know, like when i say, ""luuuucky!"" or, ""that's hot,"" or, ""you know it!"" i dont know, it was weird. 

anyway..

it was getting late, and Sara and Chelsea were hopelessly drunk while i sat there on a really high buzz.. keep in mind (this is the sad part) that i only had about 6 beers while these girls only had about 2 lol anyway, Jason gave Chelsea and i blankets, and kept saying, ""i know you have someone right now, but i'll be in my room if you want to have some fun.."" then gave me a wink. 

you know that feeling where you almost puke in your mouth? yeah.. i got that.

so i just went to bed. but how gross is that? i swear to GOD these last two weekends have been the worst, because everytime i party i always get stuck with these horny guys who hit on me, say disgusting things, and put me in bad situations. this is why i do not want to drink until i get up to Alaska, so i can actually do something with my drunkendness and my, ""feelings"".. another words, makeout and have fun with Andrew. 

so, for all you fellas out there that wanna get freaky with me.. unless you're tall, hella funny, blonde, big ears and a great smile.. it aint gonna happen!! so get used to it. i'm tired of this whole, ""shooting down guys"" thing. it's getting OLD!!

"event","so the weekend is coming up.. and i'm in definite need of some friends. i have been hanging out with me, myself, and i for the past week... and i'm already driving myself crazy!! so while i was looking through my pictures that i just got back from Target, i decided to go up to Yakima this weekend to party with my good girlfriends again.. and hit a kegger or two.. =) 

these pics are amazing!! i had no idea what was on this camera and apparently there are a lot of pics from last years end of the year dorm party that was held at the dorms.. lol and pics of Diego and Kurt shotgunning beers. wow, those were some good times. there's also some pics of the very first party i went to up in Yakima at Jessica's house... brings back a few good memories, but for the most part... they're bittersweet because i'm reminded of some stupid skank who made out with my ex right in front of me. but we're not going to go down that road!! 

anyway, i'm going to have some fun, drink some shots, dance a little bit and party it up. but don't worry.. i'm not gonna makeout/sleep with/flirt with any guys while i'm there because A) i'm not interested, B) i'm in/out/who the fuck knows with a certain relationship, and C) i'm sorta done with guys in general. 

FUCK all boys. where's the men?! forget that, where's my effin phone call?!

man.. i hate hate HATE calling people. and i hate it when i get their voicemails, too!! because then they have two options. A) call you back, or if they're really a bitch, B) pretend you never called in the first place. and as for the person that DID actually call.. what if you never get a phone call in return?

waiting can be an effin BITCH.

so now, i'm doing what every normal 20 year old girl would do... i'm waiting for my man to call. and this fucking sucks, because i don't like calling people more than 3 times a week and end up getting their... voicemail. honestly, am i having sex with the voicemail?! NO!! am i going to spend $265 to see the voicemail?! NO!! i'm not mad, just seriously embarrassed here.. because i don't want to be thought of in a ""bad"" way.. you know, annoying, irritating, agravating, obsessive, controlling.. pick any one of those lol 

geez!! can't a person just call a person to talk and plan their trip out? blah blah blah.. i mean, i seriuosly don't want to go up there if he's not going to be around that week i pick to go up to alaska.

JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER!! answer your phone and remember to return calls..

Artist: Dashboard Confessional
Song: Vindicated

Hope dangles on a string
Like slow spinning redemption
Winding in and winding out
The shine ahead has caught my eye
And roped me in so mesmerizing
It's so hypnotizing
I am captivated
I am 

Vindicated
I am selfish
I am wrong
I am right
I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself

So clear
Like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intention
Oversized and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye
And rendered me so
Isolated so
Motivated I am
Certain now that I am

Vindicated
I am selfish
I am wrong
I am right
I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself.."

and my parents know just how to get to me.

so i've decided to try this new thing called, ""patience."" and it does pay off!! friday night, i called andrew not thinking he'd call me back... but he did. granted we barely talked about anything i'd call, ""romantic,"" we did talk. and it was amazing hearing his voice again. god i miss him. 

molly really likes tommy. he won't call her back and he won't call me back. i wonder what he's up to. molly wants to go to the AK with me, too. speaking of which... i switched my plane ticket to August 5th so nicole could come up there with me. it makes sense, and i'm willing to wait. if i wait longer, my trip will be better planned out. its just better. the only thing - if molly DOES come with us, where the hell is she going to stay? maybe all three of us can rent a hotel. i dont know, it just makes more sense for nicole and i to go up there, you know, since we have guys up there. technically speaking...

andddd the answer is YES. i thought that if you slept most of the day, it went by faster but i found that theory to be partially true. so my friends are getting married, hooking up with complete strangers and calling that a, ""relationship."" it's so cute!! it makes me sad, though because i'm not with the one guy i want to be with.. 

but that's not going to last for long!! 35 days, baby. 35 days.

my dad just finished buying my air ticket, which i'm totally estatic for!! i hate flying, though... minor setback. ever since coming back from yakima, i've been getting random phone calls from all of my friends. very exciting!! angie called me, we talked for awhile. i miss her so much.. rikki and i talked on the phone, too. she's dating my friend andy.. and i have to say andy is such a hunk!! drew and tonya might be getting married... one of my other friends did... and my best friend is getting ready to get married. GEEZ PEOPLE!! what the hell is going on, here?!

i'm not getting married until i've known the guy for.. at least 5 years... ok, maybe 2.

lambert called me... he's not going to be in anchorage when i'm going to be there!! so i told him i'd make the 3 hour drive just to see him. i miss him already, too!! not to mention that dewey wants to hook me up with his friend, craig. craig... is HOT. lol he's bangin!! but i'm not really interested in finding a guy right now because i kinda have one. and i'd like to keep him, if you don't mind!! ;) moving on...

i want to go up to Alaska to see Andrew. but is he worth a $262.90 plane ticket and 10 days? right now, i feel that he definetly is worth it and i'm going up there no doubt. but i can't help the feeling that i am a little pissed off that he hasn't called me yet... and its been about 5 days since we last saw eachother. 

okay. lets stop the bullshit.

i'm not ""pissed,"" per say. i'm just sad that he hasn't had time to think, ""hell.. maybe i should call this girl that is TOTALLY into me and let her know that i'm okay and that i miss her... sort of."" i mean, i understand that he's trying to get all his shit put back together from school and yaddy yaddy yadda, but hey!! excuse me!! a little jingle on the cell wouldn't be too much to ask for, you wouldn't think? 

okay. lets stop the bullshit.

ANDREW!! I MISS YOU!! there, i said it. how pathetic is this... i'm actually counting down the days until i get to see him. man, this must mean i'm either really bored, i really like Andrew, or a combination of the two. i don't want to like him... i don't have to like him... but i do like him. it's just hard to be away from someone you're used to seeing everyday for 8 months straight, someone who knows you - intimatly and personally.

i've only cried once though!! and that's when i left the airport.

so, i figure i'm doing great so far. now if only the next 39 days will be a breeze... i'll be okay =) i just seriously can't get Andrew singing, ""we belong together,"" like Mariah Carey outta my head!! man, i seriously miss the good times. i never though i would ever be able to relate to one of her songs... but DAMN!! this one hits the head right on.

anyway, i'm going to bed. there's a baseball game tomorrow, and i can't wait to go see it. i'm just so stressed out with softball, baseball games seem to give me the break i need so i can just CHILL lol

So, i came back to the dorms after new years (where i got totally trashed off my ass, puked the entire night over 7 shots of vodka) and the first thing that happens when i get back... i went to go get my bag that andrew borrowed from me for christmas... thank GOD it was all in one piece.

only joking!! so anyway, yaddy yadda tonya and i drink a fifth of bacardi limon which was nasty as fuck... then... well, pretty much i kept having relations with andrew, and we never had a relationship. now things are a lot different, we're just friends and we're not messing around. i want him to realize that i'm not going to mess around with just anybody, and that i actually do like him. but if another guy comes along, i'm not going to spend all of my time waiting around for him to make up his mind. drew and tonya hooked up, and kc fucked my sister. that was interesting, let me tell you. i met a new girl named terri, and we're really good friends i like her a lot she's funny. jen and derek are getting married and are having a baby soon. i dont drink as much as i did first quarter, right now i'm just drinking on the weekends. i tried weed, it is def not for me. bong=bad. lets see... nothing much more to say about yvcc. i want to go back to kennewick. i miss my family, friends and the like. there is just too much drama around here, and i'm sick of it. also, there is no reason to just hang out around yakima anymore, its not like andrew wants to date me anyway.

so yeah... i'll write more later. i'm kinda tired, and its late. byee!!

a) ""your friend was in a really bad car accident. his neck seperated from his head. he's in a coma. but he's okay, he's not paralyzed and will be able to walk again. but he's still in a coma.""
b) your sister tries to hurt herself.
c) your best friend wants to marry a 24 year old, whom you've never met. and you two are the ""bestest"" of friends. or were, whichever she prefers.
d) ""hi, financial aid calling. yours is suspended. you can appeal it if you wish.""
e) dad getting pissed as hell because you were told to, ""hang the angels on the tree!!"" 

wouldn't you want to leave, too? but alas, the 31st won't come soon enough. don't get my wrong - it was really nice coming home, seeing my family. but it was way too stressful. luckily, i was invited to spend new years with tonya and her family. by the way - her baby, rachel, is walking!! and she's only 10 mths. that's soooo cute. kc definetly agrees =) yeah. so my parents bought me a bus ticket to the dalles. riding the bus should be an adventure. i just hope no one old, and smelling like cabage sits next to me.

i hope everyone elses holidays were merrier than mine... i got some new pants, shirts, the like. i wanna look hot for this one person when i get back to the dorms, because that way he won't be able to resist me hehe anyway, yup. i'll write more later.

he's done so many things to piss me off and hurt me. but then again, he's done so many things that make me just fall for him all over again. i have another guy back in yakima that wants to ""hang out,"" but i'm afraid if i hang out, i'll lose what i have with this one guy. grrrr!!

it's not like we're dating. we're just sort of dating. we used to date awhile back. i dont know why i still like him if i do, i just really like BEING around him. it's almost like i can never hate him, and always forgive him for all the mean shit he's done to me because he jsut makes me laugh all the time, happy. besides, i've done some mean shit to him, too but that was awhile back...

but that dumb whore kirstjn tries to jump up on him ALL THE FREAKIN TIME. that's something that really pisses me off. i want her to stay away from him because all shes doing is making a mess out of things.

--------------------------------------------
PEOPLE I LIKE
KC- funny guy. tries to fart on me ALL THE TIME. yeah, i know, sick!! but he's like a brother to me, we always goof around with eachother. throat jabs and dirty socks in the face are definetly a must!!

Andrew- i dated him. we're just friends now, but we still makeout and stuff. i just can't believe he failed winning at college...? but he's still tight.

Tonya- my best friend!! we do a bunch of crazy stuff together, and a lot of people think we're drunk when we're actually hyper. ""call myself crazy, but are you a baseball player?!""

Phelicia- you're an awesome girl, i have so much fun hanging out with you!! and you can do so much better than David. he's such a hypocrite. also, he kind of looks like a weasel. 
------------------------------------
PEOPLE I DONT LIKE
Kirstjn- 3 inch nipples? and when KC described sex with her, he used the term, ""hot dog down a hallway."" that's absolutely disgusting. not to mention, he also said she smelled, and gave really bad head. interesting. 

Victoria- please. if you have a problem with me, don't act like a child about it. it's just so... gay. you're weak!! (lol tonya) p.s. we WERENT talking about you, so get that through your head.
----------------------------------------------
that's pretty much the jist of it for right now. i get to hang out with tonya on new years at her house, we're gonna go into this haunted house then. KC won't do it i bet, he's so scared its ridiculously funny. i sprained my ankle this past weekend, KC carried me up the hill. that was nice of him!! hopefully it'll be better come new years, so i can go snowboarding new years day. 

anyway, i'm still the same girl. ADD and all!! =D hopefully this quarter, my classes will go by easier. i'm taking classes i think i'll actually enjoy. and that bitch david won't be RA anymore. that's right, david, i called you a bitch. so go screw your 18 year old some more. you sick 36 year old.

I'M BORED OVER HERE!! =) and also, i'm convinced my sister thinks i have spys out on her ass. so what if i do!! haha jk i dont really.. but i do have friends that watch over her. that doesn't really COUNT, though.. =)

EVER FEEL LIKE YOUR NOT BEING LISTENED TO?! happens to me all the time!! join my club, maybe we can talk to eachother until our ears fall off!! A MOMENT OF CLARITY BELOW.

""i'd just like to thank josh.. for, not answering me on my STOOPID subject of gambling tips. i know it was lame, but fuck man.. what else would have grabbed your attention?... talking about strange or different things ARE THE ONLY WAY to grab his attention."" -WENDY LYNDE

PEACE OUT HOMIES!! i guess someday things will change, which is a hell of a lot better than no day... right? Rrrrrright!! (roll the R)"

"event","i saw a really good movie tonight!! it's called, ""k-19 the widowmaker."" watching it made me realize how much i really don't want to be in a submarine lol but on the show, it was so amazing how these people gave up their lives in order to save their country. even if they had loved ones back at home.. it didn't matter, because they had to save their country. so it made me wonder... here these guys are, not caring about their own lives, and putting themselves into harms way by exposing themselves to nuclear fuel rods over 900 degrees farhenheit... all for their country?! i dont know about you, but if i were in that situation, i'd say ""SEE YA'LL LATER!!"" lol and RUN!! and that's kinda how people act today about all sorts of different things. rarely, does anyone ever think about others besides themselves. and i'm gonna plead guilty to that, too. you can relate anything to this... what you're gonna have for dinner. some would complain its breakfast food, but in somalia, some wouldn't complain for a piece of beef jerky. i've always been a beliver in putting others before yourself but then agian the phrase ""nice people finish last"" seems to ring true ALL THE FREAKIN TIME!! but i'm here to tell you it really pays off. trust me!! it did for me. 

ahhh i gtg. but seriously, CHECK OUT ALBERSTONS CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!! they're BOMB!! lol =)"

"event","theres nothign to do, i'm bored outta my mind. and i'm pissed!! i dont like boys. and all the people i made friends with in yakima that aren't coming back this year... screw 'em. obviously we weren't friends, because we dont talk anymore. jerrad and i were supposed to hang out this weekend but he never called. took me by suprise, maybe linda came along. hmmm, i'm having a thought: its just like the spokane trip all over again. i dont want to go back to yakima to see eric and jessica make out all the friggin time and to have eric talk some lame shit like he always does to me to make himself seem so ""totally awesome"" when he really seems like a babbling idiot. and i def dont wanna run into mallory where she thinks the way to popularity is talking shit about other people. seriously, all she does it dig into your private life then expose it to others in trade for a friendship. just another splinter in my ass as i slide down the banister of life. MALLORY!! you're as COOL as the GUM OFF OF MY SHOE!! cancel my subscription!! i'm over your issues...

angie and sabrina and cynthia want me to come back sooo bad and they're truly great friends!! i want to go back so bad, but my parents wont let me. not this early. it makes me sad, but at the same time i know its for the better. but GOD!! i'm so over it. 

yakima's just like a giant wedgie. a giant pain in my ass..."

"event","stupid. hyprochondriac. loser. dork. ditzy.

just some of the nicknames people seem to ""come up"" with to describe me. i've been called these things forever it seems and each time it hurts me, but i just do the only thing there is to do.. laugh, and just let it ""roll"" off of my back. i try really hard to keep my head up but its really starting to get to me now at this particular time. you know, i'm a girl that's totally oblivious to everything around me, but i'm smart, too. just because i might have facts misplaced in my brain, or stories jumbled around does not mean i'm not intelligent. i have people telling me im stupid all the time, just because i do things differently or it takes me longer to understand things. so there are two things i can do next time someone decides to make another, ""oh look, wendy is a DOORMAT! let's manipulate and use her"" remark. i can A) break your fuckin nose or B) laugh it off like its a huge joke. i usually choose the latter, but maybe next time i might decide to choose choice A. a warning: you might not want to talk to me if we're not friends. AND i believe you know what the definition of a ""friend"" is.

and that's all she wrote..."

"event","hey everyone!! i just wanted to update ya'll on the fair. it went really, really well!! everyone went on the rides, most spewed their cookies, we saw the animals, some motocross... even met a goat who used to be a crack dealer!! we heard the story via jordan. apparently, he can read the minds of goats. man... what a gift. and WHAT A STORY!! man, you're gonna have to ask jordan sometime. BUT!! moving on... i'm giving out some awards.

""YOU DONT WANNA DO IT BUT DID IT ANYWAY"" award goes to none other than my good friend, MATT MILLER. he was once quoted as saying, ""hey, wanna come in and watch a movie?"" after he lost his cookies not once, but multiple times due to a stomach churning event at the carnival rides. nice, matt!! but we're still proud of you for... holding out as long as you could lol

even though we <3 and admire matt, we need to give out our next award. the..

""GRAVITRON VIXEN"" award goes out to ERIN STORY!! she didn't wanna ride it, but we made her, and that was the ride that ended it all for her. awwwww. but hey! YOU STILL ROCK, ERIN!!

meanwhile, the..

""ZIPPER KING"" award goes out to TREVOR SHIVELY... he's obsessed with that ride. he practically owns it. and of course there are the occasional buddies who try to ride every ride... which brings up to our next award, the...

""FUN AND DONE"" award goes out to KYLE WANDLING!! he tried to conquer them all, but stopped at the zipper of death. ""next year,"" he says... ""next year."" BUT of course, every fairgoer needs a fellow pal... The...

""COOLEST BITCH IN TOWN"" award goes out to ALICIA AICHELE!! alicia talked wendy out of committing a major ""freak out"" when they were riding the zipper. as she was quoted, ""if i were riding with my brother, we'd make this thing go around the WHOLE TIME!!"" and with riding all those rides, who doesn't like someone to hold their coat for them?! The...

""COATRACK I'D MOST WANT TO BE LIKE"" award goes out to JORDAN STORY!! he sat there, waited, and watched as we all spewed our cookies and had fun. but don't be fooled... he DID get on the slide without using his tickets. ""STILL GOT 'EM!!"" was one of our favorite quotes.

And finally last but not least, we've got the...

""TAKE IT LIKE A CHAMP"" award!! that's right, this one goes out to KRISTI JENSEN who rode every ride, and took it like a champ!! you rock, kristi!!

and of course, for me, i gave myself the...

""KETCHUP DOMINATRESS"" award. wendy can't live without her ketchup. and she's not going ot let some old mean lady steer her wrong. things were a bit hazy as she reached for the bottle, and out of the shadows came a figure, which said, ""you're not supposed to do that!"" embarrassed, wendy used teh rest of the ketchup and set it down, meanwhile making a quick exit to the tables!!

that's all for now. tune in next year, for ""MOST LIKELY TO PEE YOUR PANTS,"" and ""CUE THE SPEW"" awards!! it won't be something you'd wanna miss ;) 

lots of <3 you guys!!

"event","ooh i'm pissed. its like every FUCKING friend i made in yakima cares only about themselves!! people DO NOT understand that friends, to me, are almost one of the most sacred things ever. so why on God's green earth, do i make friends with people who could care less about me, after we ""lose"" touch or whatever?! it's sooo pathetic. PEOPLE SUCK!! and like, now is the time i need friends more than ever. let me ""explain"" why i think of my friends as the way i do.. awhile ago, i had 2 friends die. and it was a really hard experience.. i mean, they were friends of MINE. i coudlnt' believe it happened to me, and it hit me like a brick wall i couldnt breathe for months after it happened and the first time my friend kim died it sent me into anxiety attacks for over a year. i dont wanna lose a friend anymore, especially the ones i became close with in yakima. but hell if they cant udnerstand that, then FUCK it. why shoudl i try?? its not worth it.

IM SOOOO PISSED!! the only reason i bring up lame subjects is because of the obvious, i just wanna talk to you!! put two and two together. damn!!"

"event","let's see. this is what REALLY happened from thursday on...

uhhh. 
on thursday i woke up late
amanda came over and we had no money so we didnt have any lunch
then we went and picked up bill and he came over for a few hours then he left for hockey
then i had soccer, and practice was really really good.
then i came home and hunter was going to lauren flax's party so i didnt wanna intrude. haha
so amanda came home and we went to harrisons.
whew, funnest night of my life. actually not really but it was still really fun.
we listened to emery for a lot of the night.
and we're all going to that show together.
im stoked.
okay there was five boys there, and they told amanda to buy 4 cases of beer. hm 48 beers for 5 people. hmm. fun. haha it was sweet though.
they were just shooting darts in each other cuz they were wasted, like in the ass. and the nipple, and in the calf. whew. it was massive.
in the meanwhile, amanda and i were watching eurotrip and playing egyptian ratscrew. =D
then harrison came home with us cuz he was shitfaced like no other. 
uhh we went to sleep, i woke up and amanda had just left so i got ready and all.
then the churches woke me up around 4 (a little late) and we went to bill's game, and we watches eurotrip and pay it forward on the way up
thenn they lost, but it's all good, it was their first game. then on the way home it was just really sad. cuz from friday i wont see bill for eleven days. 
i think its down to nine now. i dont see him till the first day of school. whew. it sucks.
he wasnt allowed to come to my games on saturday, and then he had a game on sunday. man. it sucked.
and now he's off to smith mountain lake. then to pennsylvania (i think?) for his uncle's wedding.
but at least he's gunna be having fun. =D
but anyway. 
thus weekend was my tournament and all
which was awesome
A;KLDHG;KLAGHC !!!!!
so on saturday we won our first game 2-0 and tied the second 0-0
so we were in first for the day
then we won our third game on sunday 1-0 (I SCORED) therefore we were going to the championship!
ahh we were so excited but so scared cuz the blue team were all fucking tanks. not even kidding. god damn. (john gammon)
so we had five subs to start with but four of them were injured so we were screwed.
but then. it was 1-1 at half. which was pretty awesome.
then we scored in the last five minutes. man so we were all jumping then we were all like damnit we gotta keep it up. 
so then the whistle blew
AND WE WON.
it was the first time we had all played together and we won the tournament. i think this is gunna be a good season.
oh and also, WE GOT THESE TROPHY'S THAT ARE HUGEEEE. NO JOKE.
whew, rachael was like. man i don't think this is gunna fit in my car.
we are so weird.
I LOVE ALL OF YOU.
&hearts; Lauren, Sarah, Rachael, Allison, Courtney, Laura, Casey, Renee, Kenzie, Megan, Tiffany, Anne, Taylor, Kristin&hearts;
WHEW.
now im going out to lunch with casey and hayden.

BUT PS he has his new cd out. its sweet. too bad he was high while they recorded it. haha, well whatever. then bill came over later that night and we watched <u>Hitch</u> it was pretty good. THEN. i went to bed after taking him home. and woke up early and went to the <b><font size=3>WATERMELON FESTIVAL</b></font size> in cary town. it was awesome, but it was SOOOO hot. wow. haha.

and i hadnt talked to casey all day
but i talked to samthug and we're good, we just had one of those moments.

i was in it, and i drove in my uncles 1960 porsche 4600. oh ps its bright <font color=yellow>yellow</font color>, and its my dream car. and i get it when they die. haha. so then after that we went to a barbecue.
<b>and i swear i've never had that much alcohol in a day</b>. and like yall know me, i dont drink that much, or i dont drink to get drunk persay. so ap was like go fill this up so i went to the keg and got it then shes like now drink it, so i was like fineee. so then we filled it up ehh about 8 or 9 times and had chugging contests. wow. so then we drove home, i slept for a little. so i was straight when i woke up, and then we went to another barbecue. and then dessert time came and they brought out watermelon bt they had spiked it with vodka. and when i say spike, i mean that i couldnt taste any watermelon. so i had a shitload of that. god damn. then i talked to bill for a while. andddd then i went home and watched tv until like 3 and then slept. and its really weird, like i ddint feel like i was drunk, and i dont think i was. but i havent had anything to drink, well other than beer since last summer at katies. so i dont really see how i had tolerance. but yeah. sweet.
oh, and previous days. let's see. 
i've done nothing, at all.
but you see to get things pierced here you have to be 16, so my aunt said if i get a fake license or birth certificate or something then i can get stuff done. but idk it would be weird i guess. but yeah. oh and i like this a lot. i stole it form kage's profileeee.

""I am bleeding through
 Writing songs for you
 If I could say what I felt
 Then I would draw for you
 I'm just a boy letting go of his heart
 Because the days are like knives
 And the knives are so sharp
 One more kiss - so I don't forget
 And then I'll open my arms
 To embrace the regret
 Fragile dreams - fistfight kings
 Slowdance queens...
 Oh pick me please
 Sending ""get well"" cards to former stars
 'Cause I know how it feels
 To have fallen so far
 Talentless yet nothingless
 Than hopelessly in awe of you
 I want nostalgia forever
 If we throw this life away
 Will we ever have to live again?
 Say ""no"" and I'm all yours
 Say ""yes"" and I'll still pull
 Tell the boys I'll see them soon
 Your lips were the softest yet
 North, east, south and west...

Black sweatpants, orange Strikers shirt, black WHIT sweatshirt, newbies. Oh yes. So I saw Bill for maybe 30 seconds then went to Algebra II which sucked like always. And idk Mr. Phillips has changed, like he won't let us talk anymore...Idk maybe it's for the better, but whatever! Then English class where we had a test but I got to see SAMTHUG who I love more than life, but I felt bad because she has sun poisoning on her back and everyone was hitting it. So then history, which sucked. I hate it, more than life. Except I get to see Jenna, Mallory, Connor, and Pavel. Then Spanish which rocked. Damn. We really didn't do anything. But I got kicked off of myspace. Which sucked but then I discovered a new proxy, it's tight. Then lunch. Dude, we had 25 MOTHER FUCKING DOLLARS. So we got Sarah and hoopped into line. Then stood their and ate our five course meal. Hot damn. Then I got to see Bill. Then 4D all I did was talk to Kels and Hunter, I love  them. Then Gym was awesome as usual. And Science sucked ass. Like I can't even begin to explain, we had a sub. Damnit I hate some people. So yeah then we had soccer practice afterschool. And I scored in the finals. But then we ended up losing. 2-1. But yeahh. Okay then we had an ice cream party. <b>WOULDNT THAT BE SWEET IF THAT WAS A SUPER POWER.</b> Merrily <-- I love her. Haha. And now I have to go to a Varsity guys team dinner with Robert. Call my cell if you wish. 4758413, I will love you forever. I LOVE LAURA AND SAMTHUG. And Bill, I love him a lot.   <3laura"

"event","Yeah, today was alright...I guess...
So I brought Bill two pairs of my pants in the morning. And he tried them on in the gym. It was fun. Then we played soccer, then it turned into basketball. Then Mrs. Stevens came in and told us we weren't allowed to so then we went into the commons. Then we had our moments, you know. Then I went to math, & didn't pay attention at all. Like always. But Rachel and I have so much fun in that class. Then I went to English and we watched a ghetto version of Romeo & Juliet. It was awesome. Then in History, I failed a test. What else is new. I wish I were kidding. Then during 4th I sat next to Hunter. He helps me so much. I love him more than words. Dangg, I don't know what I would do without him. Wow. And lunch was fun. Sarah and I threw pb&j sandwiches at random people. And I actually talked to Drew. And it wasn't awkward, as expected. It's weird how he hates Bill. So then I went to Health. And that class is hilarious, yet Amanda thought I was mad at her and so did Megan...Idk I was just having a....weird sort of day. Then in Science, I finally finished my project, and my homework this weekend is to complete the triboard part of the ordeal. It's so dumb. I can't wait to get out of the center. Oh and I realized why my day went horribly. Laura and Samantha were not present. They are in the <b>Bahamas</b> as I type this...having fun and getting a tan. But soccer's going good. Wow I'm good at being random. So afterschool, after me and Bill said our goodbyes I went to Sarah's car and she had alredy left...so I went to the front of the school where Hunter was and I used his phone. And Sarah didn't bother to turn around and come get me. So I decided to go with Robert to his soccer game, so I was JV manager for the day. It was the most fun of my life though. JV won 1-0 and Varsity lost 1-0. After JV's game was over we went to go pick up the Varsity team...because it's a tournament. Or something. So Jake, Bob, and I decided we were hungry so we ran back to the bus, and as we arrived the whistle blew and the game was over so we ran bakc, and got food fast then got back on the bus. Then on the way home I was giving all the guys headrubs and then Bob and Dave were being all flirty. I love them. Man oh man. Haha. Bob gave me the greatest back massage ever and DAVE HOLY CRAP GIVES THE BEST FEET MASSAGES EVER. Man I don't know why he's single, he's a great guy. Well that goes for Bob, too. They're both effing sweet. And idk it was just an all around fun time. Then we got home, went to Wendy's, went to Home Depot, went to Lowe's, went to Einstein's. Haha I love driving around at 11 PM just to do errands. Haha. Then I came home and checked my messages and I get a random one from ""Bill"" and his borther called and said ""Hey it's Mike Church, just wanted to say hi. Bye"" Haha it was funny. And then i got one from Samantha and Laura when they were on the bus yesterday and it made me sad. This weekend will suck. Because Bill is at a show tonight. And tomorrow we were supposed to chill then Sam told me that Bill was going to a show with him even though Bill told me he wasn't gunna go. Whatever. By the way, Hoes, Clothes, and Shows said hi to me today. It was lovely. Haha. Okay well I'm going to sit on my roof and contemplate things. It's so much fun. Call me though if you want to keep me company. Or something. Or comment on my Myspace. I will love you forever and a day.

"event","I'm back. Okay yo. I've decided that livejournals are the best way to let out my feelings. So here goes.

Today was fun. Me and Bill were sort of having problems...and I'm not sure why. Pretty much he said ""I Love You"" and he didn't mean to, it sort of slipped out of his mouth. Which idk it really didn't matter, no matter if he loves me or not I still want to be with him. And for as long as I can. Who knows? I sure don't. But I like him more than any other guy..or at least I haven't felt like this in a long time. Whatever though.

Too bad Hillary and Sam broke up. Bill and I enjoyed hanging out with them. We had the greatest time together! So yeah I think this weekend is going to suck. Both Laura and Sam-thug (my best friends ever) are going to be in the Bahamas. But one plus - Bill, Tom, and I are going to buy lightsabers and are going to have a fun Star Wars night. It will be the funnest night of my life even though Samantha doesn't want us to do it until she returns. But we just can't wait.

And also, Bill is obsessed with hockey. It sucks. Bad. Cuz I never see him, other than school. And sometimes on the weekends when he doesn't have games. And we hardly ever talk anymore. I think that would be the only reason I would ever break up with him, I hardly ever talk to him. But today was really fun. It's pretty sweet, we kiss constantly. And he knows holding hands is my favorite thing ever, so now we hold hands constantly, also. Haha. It's pretty sweet. One month has gone by really fast with him. It's awesome. I think we're gunna be together for a long time. It's pretty cool, I guess. Haha.

But you know what's weird? I've been hanging out with his ex-girlfriend a lot lately. Because I made the JV Soccer team at Godwin. It's pretty awesome. I LOVE THAT TEAM SO MUCH. Like seriously we have so much fun, it's awesome. I'll explain more later, because I have to go work on something. Uhm, talk to you guys later.


Love,
Laura"

i think you know what im getting at. i find it so upsetting that he memories that you select;you keep the bad but the good you just forget.

make your decision and dont you dare think twice.
go with your instincts along with some bad advice.
this didnt turn out the way i thought it would at all.
you blame me but some of this is still your fault.

i tried to move you,but you wouldnt budge.
i tried to hold your hand but youd rather hold your grudge. i think you know what im getting at;you said goodbye and i just dont want you regretting that."

"event","WOAH WOAH i mist say. friday was probably one of the funnest nights of mu life...okay so afterschool i went home with katelyn and we went to wendy's and got some dinner then hung out and watched legally blonde 2 then went back up to ghs and got settled and such...and i hollered at amanda...my girl. lol. then we did the game and such. wow it was so much fun. haha wow we were cracking up most of the time. w00t...so then during half time we got dip'n dots then we were like NO half times over...so we gave it to emily and ran to the gym and sat down haha...then during 4th quarter emily had to go so katelyn had to run out and get the ice cream and give it to my step dad and then ran over to me...and meanwhile i was panicking bcuz i was doing everything my myself wow lol...so then afterwards i had to go straight to aishus house...wooo lolo. and i got there at like 5 till 8 ...so right when i got there we got in the car and left....so we got there and saw manasa and bryan moorefield and amit jain! i sure so miss them! so then we were just like man screw waiting for guys and we went into the place where the dance was and we were just dancing and such and i saw seth (aka tha pimp) walk in and there was this hot guy with im and im like AISHU COME HERE, THEY'RE HERE! so we went and hugged seth and seths like, THIS is syriac. and sihus jaw dropped. no joke. lol. so then they went off and i must say aishu is the greatest dancer EVER. haha and her and syriac are the hottest thing to ever walk the planet. seth was like whoo im good haha. so then later on seth was like i need a girl...and i was like oh sethy i need a fella. so hes like well...we will find one for you. so hes like, ""well! theres johnny but i think he likes that girl, and there's derek, and theres another john"" so i was like hm...and i was thinking about it and BEN BRONNER comes up and we danced and it was lovely I MISS HIM SO MUCH! whooo so then i was thinking more and i was  checking out derek and i was like so whos this derek character. so seth literally drags me over to him and is like hey do ya wanna dance with laura....shes my best friend. lol so then seths like wait i see a single lady so he walks away and im like wow hes such a dumbass and dereks like oh but i love him and im like yeah me too...then there was an awkward silence then hes like well...ya wanna dance? and im like sure...so we went out and found aishweriac ((me and seths name for aishu and syriac)) and danced near em and then it was weird...when the dance ended we both like walked away...cuz idk i was being shy around him. lol so then a slow song came on and i was looking around and i was walking to go sit down at a table in the room over and hes like hey wait...do ya wanna dance? and im like yeah and idk it was good. i do remember that it was to crazy by kc and jojo and whoo...so then we stayed together and seth talked to us lol...then we were dancing again and johnny was like hey psstt closer lol and derek was like come on man there's contact lol....then ill never break your heart by backstreet boys comes on and derek smiles at me and i smile back and i put my arms around him and we were close....it was the last dance. and he smells good. and i like his hair lol. 
it.was.*sigh*
so then afterwards we were just with seth and syriac and aishu and we were holding hands and just enjoying ourselves then my mom walks in and is like uhm come on lol. so i was like uhm aishu we need to go haha but she didnt wanna leave her boo...like seriously that night was amazing [[ and derek - being with you was magical ]] so then we finally had to go and we said our goodbyes and such.....we had such a good night. we never wanted to leave. and we found out that seth and syriac rule the school...no joke haha. but me and aishu were talking and we definitely thought that it was better than any dance that we had ever been to cuz there was only about 50 ppl there and everyone was nice to each other and everyone was in one big crowd...not like lil cliques...but i must say that me and aishu will most likely be seeing more of that group lol.

so then we took aishu home and i was supposed to go to the lock in a tcps but i was WAY too tired so i just stayed home and watched tc and got online...funtimes. yepp. and then this morning i woke up at like 11 and i went out shopping with sarah and got x-mas presents for most people. it was fun just hangin with my big sis! PARC PLACE = italian restaurant! hahahhahah. wow. and the strata...""whos listening to that music?"" ""they are"" ""but they're WHITE"" hahhaha whooo.

then i came home and BLASTED the used and then jenna came over and we were just chillaxin. yeah me sarah jenna and maybe kristin are probably going to the senses fail // the used // killswitch engage // etc show in norfolk. its gunna ROCK. 

so then i kinda got mad at chelsea cuz i was the ONLY one who didnt get invited to her party cuz i ""cause too much drama"" and yeah i definitely had a gift for her and everything...yeah. it pissed me off. i was so sad....seriously. then bruno told me that we were sleeping at tuckahoe little league and doing stuff =) haha thats for me to know and for you never to find out....but my mom was like come on we hafta go to a uva game...it was the semifinal game vs DUKE. yeahh it was an awesome game. i wonder if ms. kaitlyn brennan was there? lol tell me if you were girl! haha yeah uva lost 3-0 and it suckedd, but yeah duke was good. it was fun though. especially cuz the announcer's voice was slightly homosexual and everytime he said anything me and my mom would just crack up hahhaha wow. and on the way home we stopped and i got a donut and a strawberry slushy of some kind. SLUSHY HAHHAHA >> SUCK THE SLUCH. hahah jess!! wow...yeah so then we had to stop and get some gas and there was this trailor next to us and there was a horse in it and i was like man i with i was at TLL and my moms like i wish i were riding a horse...it was so random...we werent even talking about it lol. but its all chill. haha....woo man so yeah i just got home and i hope my mom will take me to TLL...idk but

Sarah was a whoopie cushion, Thomas was Jesus, Kristin was Ken Jennings, Holly was a blade of grass, Jessica was a goth, these 2 kids were Tetris blocks, and there were many many more. So the day went good >> did nothing in 1, in 2nd took a test, in 3rd took a ""team"" vocab quiz pretty much meaning you can cheat as much as you wanna haha, uhh 4th we presented our proyectos haha then we were playing a game with dry erase boards and brent was writing down all the cuss words he knew then i take it awy from him and he goes ""bitch"" and im like excuse me and he goes oh sorry i forgot to write that one down! lol, LUNCH was pretty fun, i sat with tim brent katelyn *kevin* darby and a couple of other people...but it was pretty fun. then during 4D i got a pass to go to the clinic and i came back and sat with kevin during his lunch. but while i was there tim brent and darby took EVERYTHING out of my backpack and put it on my desk...not fun to clean up, then in 5th we just talked the whole time haha me megz zack and bob had a big 4some group hug haha..., then in 6th we just listened to music cuz we had a sub hahah and will taylor and justin put a big picture of a dick on tj's computer so when he opened it up he almost peed himself cuz he was laughing so hard! hahah, then in 7th we did nothing either BUT i broke chris's computer...oops haha, then we went to the pep rally cuz we played the big DSF tonight..so yep that was fun.

then afterschool we gathered as a group like we always do and bruno tim and joey went in bruno's car to tuckahoe little league baseball fields. then matt matt brent and kevin walked over to joey's. then i went over to katelyns and i must say she is one awesome girl....me and her talked about some crazy things but i <3 her to death! thats all i can say! we talked about anything and everything! then we were gunna go to the godwin vs freeman game but her mom said no so we called up brent and him and kevin came over. and lets just say me and kevin had fun. haha we watched the italian job, not that any of us watched it...but yeah. katelyn and brent were having problems so we were switching around lol 1st it was the couples then it was me and brent then katelyn and kevin [trying to sort things out] then we switched to girls and boys and we FINALLY worked things out. soo yep then the boys had to go...and im just gunna say i really dont want kevin to break my heart like matt did...i cant stand guys like that. we'll see though. haha when kevin and brent were walking from joeys to brents kevin picked up this HUGE pumpkin and tryied to lift it and it plopped right out of his hands and fell into 3 pieces haha....yepp so that was pretty much my night. then i came home, talked to casey, kevin, patrick, joey, and bruno and found out that godwin won our game...funstuff..haha and i was like bruno you make ma laugh and he goes :  [[he was on joey's sn cuz hes at his house]]

Laura Muhammad Whitney
ohh he makes me laugh so hard haha

yep and here are some saweeeet lyrics
from all hail the heartbreaker
by the spill canvas
woot woot

I had the notion that you'd make me change my ways 
My bad habits would be gone in a matter of days 
I had the feeling that you'd open up my eyes 
To a whole new world that had since been in disguise 

But that day will most likely never come for me 
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
To everything you are 

So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
And overanalyze your words 
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
It's taking everything in me 
Just to forget your sweater so far 

I had the notion that you'd make me forget the world 
But your undecisive mind shows me that 
You are ""just another girl"" 
I had the feeling that those looks you gave me were real 
What if I ripped your heart apart at the seams 
Maybe then you'd know how I feel 

But that day will most likely never come for me 
And it's just my luck to end up getting stuck 
To everything you are 

So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures 
And overanalyze your words 
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard 
It's taking everything in me 
Just to forget your sweater so far 

I can honestly say 
That I never, ever, ever felt this way 
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
These are the parts of your body 
That cause my comatose to begin 

I can honestly say 
That I never, ever, ever felt this way 
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin 
These are the parts of your body 
That cause my comatose to begin 

I will sleep another day 
I don't really need to anyway 
What's the point when my dreams are infected 
With words you used to say 
I will breathe in a moment 
As long as I keep my distance 
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up 

So don't go worrying about me 
It's not like I think about you constantly 
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 

So don't go worrying about me 
It's not like I think about you constantly 
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect 
Your life anymore 
I knew it the moment you walked into the door 

I'll let you get the best of me 
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
I'll let you get the best of me 
Because there's nothing else that I do well 
I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker 
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
ALL HAIL THE HEARTBREAKER"

Could we dim the sun
And wonder where we've been
Maybe you and me 
So kiss me like you did
My heart stopped beating
Such a softer sin

(I'm melting, I'm melting)
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while

And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me
Now

Never caught my breath
Every second I'm without you I'm a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
why cuts aren't healing
Learning how to love

I'm melting (I'm melting)
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
And I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me
(Stay with me lay with me now)

You could stay and watch me fall
And of course I'll ask for help
Just stay with me now
Take my hand
We could take our heads off
stay in bed just make love that's all
Just stay with me now

I'm melting (I'm melting)
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
and I'm melting

In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me
Lay with me
In your eyes
I lost my place
Could stay a while
and I'm melting
In your eyes
Like my first time
That I caught fire
Just stay with me lay with me 
(Stay with me, lay with me)

In your eyes
Lets sleep till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes (I'm melting in your eyes)
Let's leave till the sun burns out
I'm melting in your eyes


""All That I've Got""

I need something else
Would someone please just give me
Hit me, knock me out
And let me go back to sleep
I can laugh
All I want inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me I...

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got"

"event","Hi:
Okay, so you can't help knowing that Edna Turnbull is John Travolta and maybe it is hard to imagine him dressed as a woman and what a risk to his career doing this movie, but I must say this was truly a fun and joyful movie and everyone applauded at the end and there was much laughter in the theatre and we had a nice turnout for a Monday afternoon!!! It was a lot of fun and everyone in the cast was just marvelous from start to finish!!!
I don't agree with Travolta regarding his outlook on psychiatric care and medication, but I still like him and he is an incredible actor and at least he didn't come out swinging like Tom Cruise nor did he make a jerk of himself either like Cruise did!!! Everyone is entitled to their beliefs and opinions, but don't criticize other people who do need medication for psyhological disorders just because you don't believe in it. Anyway, I went off topic, see Hairspray, it is really a lot of fun and everyone is just marvelous!!! Travolta rocks in Hairspray!!!

"event","Hi:
I am feeling reflective today, one of my dearest friends lost her mom on Sunday morning to a heart attack and both mother and daughter have battled breast cancer.  My friend Maria is disabled from meningitis when she was a baby and paralyzed on her right side, but she is one of the most inspirational people I know.
Her parents were incredible people and the way they raised Maria, made me think of a wonderful remark one of my Psychology teachers and friend has always said about how to treat disabled people, ""treat them as a person,"" not their disability"" and Maria's parents were one of the examples of the great examples of this saying. They raised Maria to learn to cook, take care of herself, etc. and prepared her for the time when she would be on her own and though she is grieving, she said she can take care of herself and knows her parents are looking out for her. What classy people. I'm relective because I was one of the luckiest people to be considered a daughter by her parents and they treated me like one and their pride in our friendship was incredible. They have much to be proud of but also they are blessed with a daughter who is inspirational and overcomes a lot. I'm truly blessed with the wonderful friends I do have in my life who are so inspirational and the wonderful people who have taught me well.

"event","Hi:
Several topics make me want to vent, both positively and negatively. I wlil start with the positive, a tribute to Lady Bird Johnson, a lady who was classy under the pressures of being in the spotlight during many trying moments in history, especially after the JFK assassination and also being before her time about conservation etc. She was classy and though many were angry at her husband about Viet Nam, the presidency still held respect for the office, unlike today, Johnson himself did a lot for this country with signing medicare etc. His wife will be missed too!!!
Now to the negative, Bush ordering his people not to testify which doesn't surprise me one bit, another plea to be patient with the war and of course his future pardoning of Scooter Libby!!! Hmmmmmmmmm!!!! Not surprising. I also had to laugh snidely reading about Nixon thinking the Democrats are with the mob, he wasn't nice at all, he was paranoid for sure!!!
And finally Rosie O'Donnell, okay I used to be a fan of hers when she had her variety-talk show, but now she is getting so annoying and if you don't agree with her, forget it!!! I am open-minded and all and I don't agree with Elisabeth Hasselback's conservatism, but I think Rosie was out of line and disrespectful and she is getting really annoying!!! She and Donald Trump annoy me to no end!!!
Finally, I agree with  my friend Ian, you don't show disrespect to the Queen or any other dignataries whether you agree with them or not, if you are asking for a favor or an interview, you try to respect their customs so I think Annie Liebowitz was out of line asking the Queen to remove her crown during a photo shoot. Perhaps the Queen was a bit childish in her tantrum, but she is the Queen!!! 
Enough said!!! I hope I didn't offend anyone by this posting!!! It's just an opinion!!!

"event","Hi:
I recently read in the AARP newspaper about this 95 year old lady who just received her degree in Kansas City and is the oldest person in the world to get a degree according to Guiness Book of Records, so it proves it is never too late to learn despite some people who are negative all the time who tell me it is!!! It's their problem, not mine. 
Now for the not so happy stuff, I was irate when I heard that Scooter Libby's prison term was commuted and that Bush is keeping the door open to a pardon, so why does it not surprise  me what this president does, he has lied to us about the war and continues to ask our patience while our servicemen and women are getting killed!!!  I am getting to hate politics more and more!!!!
Kudos to Al Gore on his mission with saving the environment.
Okay, so I have whined now. Keep cool everyone!!!

"event","Hi:
Two things I have read about and bothers me. One is President Bush's veto of the stem cell bill!!! Here he is hugging a young lady with spina bifida and yet he vetoes the bill saying it is ""immoral"" I think it is immoral not signing it and dashing hopes of many who might have a chance to one day not have any disabilities and those who do now, a chance to walk, not have the symptoms of Parkinson's erase Alzheimer's, Spina Bifida, Autism etc and he dashes these hopes!!! Ugh!!! I have friends who can benefit from this research and he doesn't seem to care.
My second topic is John Travolta's comment to a magazine supporting Tom Cruise's stand on mental health medication and blaming Virginia Tech tragedy on Paxil and other meds instead of the guns disgust me!!! As a psychology major and one who takes Paxil for depression, I don't think I am inhuman as Mr. Travolta and Cruise both comment that people who take these  medications will go out and kill someone. If you are properly supervised with meds, and you take your meds as directed with the right doctor, it is important you get treated for these mental health disorders such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Post-Partum as Brooke Shields and many women suffer from. I don't think less of anyone who needs to take these meds if needed and under th eproper doctor's care. 
These are just my opinions.

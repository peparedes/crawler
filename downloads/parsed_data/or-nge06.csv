"event","Yesterday was the definition of boredom and its destructive effects. First April and Linds and I had a McAllister's picnic on a bridge and watched a bird catch and eat a fish and then contemplated the mating techniques of dragonflies (ie: do they have 'plevi' to thrust?). 

It's easy to see that we were bored of that quickly.  So what else is there to do on Saturday afternoon but go on a roadtrip.  Yes thats right, we hit the highway with our trusty Doobie Bros. and successfully navigated the town of Fairview in Union Co.  

Soo when all of this excitement was over and done with we were still not satisfied-and to the drug store we went.  We left with bottles of ""Electric Black"", ""Hot Mahogany"" and ""Sunset""...hair dye that is.  April's mom wouldn't let her dye her hair [guh] BUT she rebelliously dyed some streaks but to no avail.  So she assisted Lindsey and I as we spread purple and orange mousse on our hair [yikes! needless to say I was freaking out].  After two sinkfuls of grape and tomato colored water and one purple scalp  and one lodged toothbrush and about 2 hours later we had...the exact same color hair as we did when we started. HA funny how things work out. But hey, if i stand in the sun then sometimes it reflects some red, sorta. And Lindsey's hair is definitely black now...instead of dark dark dark brown!

Well Lindsey and I ended the night with some ice cream, a nice dead bird and Finding Neverland.  But we were too distracted with missing people to follow any kind of story line.  Nights = too much time to think = not fun.  Too bad you aren't just on vacation."

"event","So summer got off to a rough start, to say the least, but it's working out better than expected.  Erica has started me my very own livejournal [i heart her] so that i have something to do this summer!  My life isn't exactly exciting, so i appologize in advance for rubbing off my boredom onto any unsuspecting readers. Oh and also bare with me and my spelling, as most know, its not my forte.

Last night i got to spend time with the loves of my life: Kat and Lindsey!!  We were suppose to go see Max's band play...but some bitch ass lady wouldn't rent them a Uhaul.  So instead we got some Chinese food at the Wok (which oddly is pronounced the same as 'walk'...humm), and the band played at their house instead. Let me tell you, they know how to rock out-haha.  The performance was complete with, as Liz put it, the first mosh on a bed...also known as sex. We will have to put project ""favorite panties"" into action soon, too bad we are gonna have to change the name cuz that word makes me cringe...  

I came home today to flowers on my doorstep <3

"event","Well I never really thought I would update on this again. But hey I might as well utilize this thing when I have the time. I am just going to update about my navy career so far. Boot camp was a very good experience for me. I enjoyed myself. It was way more mental work then physical work. The physical work was not even that hard. It was about 8 weeks of just following orders from our RDC's. I made it out of there easily. Navy boot camp is not as hard as some people think it is. You just have to know that you have to follow what ever the RDC's tell you to do. I even got promoted so that was a good thing. Now I in ""A"" school. Or job training. I am still here in Great Lakes, Il but I have a lot more freedom here. it's great. It's like going to school again. During the day I go to classes and after classes are done we pretty much get to do what we want. We can go off base and stuff and wear regular clothes. It's good stuff. We just have to be back by 6 am the next morning. We also have weekends off. So good stuff. I am training to become a Hospital Corpman. Pretty much a medic for the navy. so yeah that's what life has been for me in a nutshell. I graduate from ""A"" school on August 19. Hopefully I will have two weeks off after that. Well thank you for reading. All of you take care."

I love the ones
Who I can never have
You are my inspiration
You make me want to love
You are the joy in my life
And I know you know it
Because you look at me
With your gorgeous eyes
And you make me smile 
With those looks you always give
Your bright smile
Can take all the demons away
And when you speak 
I get chills down my back
The touch you give
Is higher than heaven
Forever you will be my Crush
And never will I forget
The days you filled me with joy
And the times you made my life complete."

"event","well people if you are reading this then prepare yourself. this is an entry that i am going to just let everything out. all of the things that are bothering me. well most of the things that have been eating me up inside. first off if you did not know things with my brother are worse then ever. all he does is piss me off everyday. he makes me do everything. he takes my things without asking, and i can't do anything about it. for those of you who have seen me with my brother i only act like things are cool b/c i can't do anything about it. he would just kick my ass. another thing that bothers me is that my parents see what he does to me and yet they don't do anything. it's like they don't care what he does to me. they just sit back and watch. i've come to realize that they do favor him way more then they favor me. let me go back to support my point. lets compare graduations. ed barely graduated, while i graduated with honors, and good gpa and a way better sat score then him. he gets this big ass party that they planned out and everything, i get this small family party where i had to invite my friends myself. how about cars. he crashes the car and it can't even be repaired. and yet he gets a new car and he doesn't even have to pay for it. how do i get a car? i have to be lucky and get a free car from my uncle. how about chores around the house. lets see what does he do around the house..... that's right nothing. he doesn't even clean his own room or do his own laundry. and yet what do i do that's right everything. wash the dishes, clean my room, do my laundry, clean the backyard, take out the trash, get the mail oh the list goes on. the fool does not go to school right now, he doesn't have a job he pretty much sits around and does nothing but make my life misrable. my parents don't even tell him anything. and yet when i told them i was gonna quit disney they got on my case about finding another job before quiting. i don't even need a freaking job. it is because of my brother and my parents that i am not home a lot anymore. it's 1:32 am and i'm not at home. i don't sleep there. my parents think i am at home. that's how much they pay attention to me. i just go home to shower and change my clothes. i either sleep at my cousin's house or in my car. if i sleep in my car it's right outside my complex. that is how bad it is in my house right now. i just think i need a break from everything. there are other things bothering me but i have to talk to talk to that person when i see her. well not really bothering me but just something on my mind. i really have to talk to this person. so i am sorry if you get me at bad times. i try not to let things bother me when i with you guys. but sometimes the pent up anger and sadness just comes out. i am sorry for that. so if you don't have any contact with me for a little while don't worry. i should be fine."

Happy birthday to a special friend!
Although I haven't known you many years,
Perhaps because you've dried so many tears,
Pleasure reigns as I these greetings send.
Your happiness should last till all things end! 

Because you've been so sweet and understanding--
In toughest times you've made me laugh and smile--
Rejoice in your own specialness awhile:
This I'm not requesting but demanding!
How else to make yourself the celebration,
Doing what does not come naturally?
Always your concern has been for me,
Yet now you must endure my adoration!


well let us see what has happened since my last update. hmmm that friday i didn't really do anything. chilled with agraphyte and twinkle toes for awhile. then went to jamba juice to meet up with mandrew. discussed some seriously funny stuff. BODY ODOR. she just gets better and better each time. lol after that i went home to see my idiot brother. so i just left. i went to my cousins house chilled with her. then when she needed to sleep i went to e games until 3 am. then to dennys, then to tommys. then i went home parked outside and slept a little in my car. i woke up and went home b/c my brother left. so i slept a little more and it was off to my cousin's 21 b-day party. fun stuff. they had a stripper but i didn't watch. i don't see the point. ask any of my aunts and uncles and even my cousins if you don't believe i didn't watch. i slept at my cousins house to avoid my idiot brother. i also drove home some drunk people. drunk people are really funny. they don't even know what they talk about most of the time. on sunday i went to work. easy stuff but it was a long shift. i'm glad i'm not going to be working there anymore. monday i finally got the cast/splint off. that thing really bugged. my middle finger has very slight pain but the doc said that is normal since it has to get used to free movement again. went to work then just chilled at home. have i mentioned i hate my brother. then today. today was a good day b/c Sarah Orines was born this day. went to class wearing my indiana jones hat. then it was off to mt saint mary's to cook for chata. she wanted tacos and mashed potatoes so i made that stuff. hope you liked it chata. chilled there. sorry if i kept you from studying. you could have kicked me out earlier. i would have slept in my car until the traffic went away. said hello to jexy, karin, gabby, jer e el, annie, tashna, and more people i met. oh yeah agnes enjoyed our fine meal too. shot around a little. can't wait to get back on the court again. i just want to play some games. who's down to play some b-ball? hit me up and i'll be there. that was pretty much the night. went home earlier then usual b/c chata really had to study. talked on the phone with mandrew and meli boogs. and now i am home. found out i have a dreamcast now too. good stuff. well that's it for now.

Lyrics of the Day
Opposite's attract
when the female and male come in contact
sticky situation in fact
tryin no to let the feelings catch
but there's a thin line between both of y'all
so you respect that
and entertain the idea, but you get brought back 
to reality, and could you really live with that?
Decisions, based on intuition
you love and keep your distance
hug and kiss in friendship

P.O.T.D.
SARAH ORINES A.K.A. CHATA
i hope no one was suprised by my pick. Sarah is the person of the day because it is her birthday. a great person was born this day. and i'm glad she came into my life. you guys are probably tired of hearing that. today was cool. even though i think i kept you from studying. i hope your test goes well. tacos and mashed potatoes are a pretty good combination. thanks for the vanilla coke. oh yeah i will get you your own indiana jones hat. do you want anything else. well i hope you had fun today. i did. thanks for coming into my life. like your comment said who knows where i would be without you.

JASON TOLENTINO A.K.A. JAYTO
jayto gets the honor because he is basically the reason i got the job at 24 hour fitness. he talked to his manager and all i really had to do was turn in the application. i really didn't interviewed. the manager just basically told me what i had to do when i started and she was asking me if i could handle the job. but thanks to jayto i now have a new job. plus it will be cool b/c i haven't really hung out with him that much lately.

J to the DO was also there and we met Tasha's boys. Also us amat people had an inpromptu reunion. it was a good nite. the roots are moving up in rank with me. they are now probably number four on my list. but number two and three are on their way down. the whole group rocks. all though i wanted to cut my fingers off i still enjoyed. well other than that what else has happened. nothing much really. just trying to recover from this stupid ass injury. i am taking the pain killers now. the pain was way too much for me to handle. but i didn't take them yesterday b/c i probably would have fallen asleep during the concert. my recovery is taking slower then expected i have to keep the cast/splint on for a little while longer. my idiot brother still has not apologized for making me go through this pain. i don't understand this fool. he hurts me and the fool is too big to apologize. and what sucks is that my parents are sort of on his side. well just the fact that they really don't care that he has not apologize gets me pissed. they keep telling me it was an accident. BULL SHIT!!!!!!!!!! why did the fool tackle me when he knew i still had a cast on? i don't know is it becuase he is an idiot? yes i think so. the fool does nothing right now. no job, no school, and still my parents put up with him. this is a bunch of crap. well now that i got that out of my system what else has happened. hmmm well i decided to coach the kids again. well sort of. i am going to be an assistant coach. i don't have enough time to be a head coach. hmmmm oh yeah chewy's party. that was fun stuff. twinkle toes pulled off some classick twinkle toes by backing into the jacuzzi. funny stuff. then twinkle toes took one for the team and carried chewy into the pool. comedy. then once again the trio of andrillo, slave job, and me did our version of after the love has gone. and of course more kareoke came after. good nite. that's pretty much the big stuff since the last update. i hope joy had a good day for her b-day. that's it for now.

So many things I've got to tell you
But I'm afraid I don't know how

From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change cause......

"event","Don't get me wrong. I am a happy guy right now. There are just things on my mind. Man life is damn hard sometimes. I ran about ten freakingmiles yesterday in the blazing heat. Boy was that stupid. I think i lost all of the water in my body. Then when i got back home I freaking messed up my left hand. I slipped on some oil and landed badly on my left ring and middle fingers. It hurt like a %#$*#. So i got that checked out, and i dislocated both of them. Right now i have a soft cast on them. The doc said the cast should be off by the end of this week. I do some stupid ass things. Hopefully things will get better. Not just for me but for all of us. Especially the Manly Men. We all seem to be going through some tough situations. Well just realize that you're not stupid like me and go injure himself. Things will get better.

Everything

find me here
speak to me
i want to feel you
i need to hear you
you are the light
that is leading me
to the place where
i find peace again
you are the strength
that keeps me walking
you are the hope
that keeps me trusting
you are the life to my soul
you are my purpose
you are everything
and how can i
stand here with you
and not be moved by you
would you tell me
how could it be
any better than this
you calm the storms
you give me rest
you hold me in your hands
you won't let me fall
you still my heart
and you take my breath away
would you take me in
would you take me deeper now
'cause you're all i want
you are all i need
you are everything
everything

"event","I really can not believe that it has been one year already. This has not been that easy of a subject for me. It is probably the same for everyone also. It is just hard to think that maybe it could have been my plane that those, for lack of a better word, bastards hijacked. If you do not know i was in NYC and Washington D.C. right before the attacks happened. I was actually in D.C. right before the attacks. I left on September 10 but i was suppose to leave September 11. I remember waking up and checking my phone. It said i had 17 messages. I was wondering why i had so many messages. So i call and start to listen. As the first message came on it was Joy, her voice sounded so worried and concerned. She was asking if i was ok and again i was wondering why does she sound like that and why is she asking that. So i listen to the rest of the messages. Each one sounding similar to the previous. In my head now i was thinking that there was a plane crash. Boy was i not prepared for what i was about to see. I went downstairs and turned on the T.V. I immediately dropped to my knees. I could not believe what i was watching. I sat there for almost two hours just watching. I didn't even realize that no one was home. Then a knock at my door and it was Cinna. I opened the door and she just jumped up and hugged me. She was crying. I started to cry also. She thought that she had lost me. I told her i am fine. It was at that point when everything just came to me. I realized that i was suppose to come home from D.C. that day. I was at the pentagon less then 24 hours before it was hit. I saw the W.T.C. just days before that. You don't know how many times i have thanked God for guiding me to take an earlier flight. There were so many that lost their lives that day. They will be remembered. Today will never be forgotten. If you have not yet observed a moment of silence please do so. Let us hope that a tragedy like this will never ever happen again. It is times like this that make me realize even more that i am truly blessed. I have a great life, a great family, and great friends. Please if any of you want to share your feelings and experiences go right ahead."

Wed was cool. we went to the beach to do some boogie boarding and tried surfing again did we conquer those waves yes we did. after the beach house named hornbuckle(andrew's cousins beach house and his last name is hornbuckle) it was off to the dodger game. man what a great game. O Dallas Perez was the man that game. he threw a shut out and hit the only home run in the game. good stuff. thur and fri i was back to work. have i ever said i don't really like work anymore. it sucks. oh yeah friday we went to leen's place to eat some good food. eraz and andrillo played the man game. it's one stupid game but they proved their manhood well that's if they have their manhood still. sat i worked again in the heat from hell. after work i called up chata and we decided to go to roscoes. i called up other people and none of them could go. so it was just me and chata. we talked about a lot of stuff. like the bets she owes me and how nice guys finish last. after that we chilled back at msmc until like 230. we watched the rock and i complained about her picture thing. sunday i went to mass with mandrew, meli boogs, and jonareno. after that it was off to the block to eat and try and score some clothes from all the sales. but no luck plus i had to go to work. yeah once again work sucks. monday was such a cool day. i thought it would suck since i had to work but guess what they let me go home early. i worked for like one hour and they asked me if i wanted to leave and i said ""hell yes."" so i just went to meet up with, bear with me it's a list, andrillo, meli boogs, eraz, mandrew, chata, jonareno, agraphyte, and meli boog's cousin(sorry i forgot her name). we did some boogie boarding and some football action. our team of chata, jonareno and me lost but we put up a valient effort against four people. after that meli boogs, cousin, mandrew, jonareno and eraz left. so andrillo, chata, agraphyte and i went to the greatest place on earth. that's right we went to cold stones. then after that it was off to the SCARY DARK RIDE. thanks for letting me ride that guys. i couldn't go to sleep. damn SCARY ABERCROMBIE RIDE. so that was the weekend. good stuff happened. got to spend some quality time with the friends. wish everyone could have been there. oh yeah guess where i went today again. that's right i went to cold stones. this time it was with del thel. it's cool b/c it's like a monthly thing. it's fun to chill with people i don't normally chill with. school is going well also. all of my classes are pretty good. i mean where else can i catch up on sleep if i didn't get enough sleep the nite before. well that's it for now.

PERSON OF THE DAY
SARAH ORINES A.K.A. CHATA
-------Well when we went to roscoes she made me realize something. and that is that i shouldn't give up. i should keep on trying no matter what. who knows what would have happened if we didn't have that talk. well chata thanks for that. oh yeah if you read this i have something to tell you/ask you. thanks for being one great friend. also this goes for all of my friends. you are all great friends. i know you guys would be there for me in a flash thanks. 

QOD
""It's the most unhappy people who most fear change.""
-Robert F. Kennedy

---i believe this quote is very true. how could a person expect things to not change. that is just ridiculous. no matter what things will change. it can deal with small things or it can deal with big things. i know some of my relationships with my friends have changed. i wish that didn't happen but it's just hard. the only i can do is repair what has been damaged and work to keep things going well. change is unavoidable. the best we can do is try to make things change for the better. 

CLASS OF THE DAY......COTD
bio lab......well today's lab was actually not bad. maybe it's b/c there were some cool people in my group. we just looked at osmosis, and all that crap. but i wasn't sleepy. fun stuff. oh yeah i also texted some people and had little conversations with them. so bio lab was good. 

USEFUL INFORMATION OF THE DAY.......U.I.O.T.D.
----did you know that when you are in the carpool lane you can exit anytime you want just as long as there is a white line on your side of the lane. you can't enter b/c of the double yellow lines but you can exit since there is a white line on your side. i would like to thank del thel for that information. cold stones was fun. remember next time it's on me. and roscoes here we come."

even though we're apart,
wherever I go, whatever I do, 
you're always in my heart.

There's not a day that passes by

why was I blessed with a friend like you?
Even after what I've put you through.

Through all the pain and all the tears,
you're always there to calm my fears.
Thanks for always being around,
to help me up when I am down.

So, I want you to know: 
no matter what happens,

"event","well this entry is titled that in honor of kevin puig and his amazing loose ball hustle play. we were playing ball at eraz's house when the ball bounce off towards the pool. job, eraz, and kevig chased after that ball. job and eraz stopped before the pool but kevig did not. so he fell into the pool. man that was classic. very funny stuff. well now time for the real update. don't even ask me to tell everything that has happened since i last updated. that is too damn long ago. well the three ladies have gone back to school. actually jexy and chata are also back in school. joy was the first to depart and boy did i ever screw up that nite. can you believe i didn't even visit her before she left.....well it's true. i have talked to her and we both let some things out i hope our friendship can build on what we have right now. let me tell you about hawaii next.....oh wait i didn't go. stupid airlines. oh well i am taking it as a sign that i wasn't suppose to go. it also gave me a chance to see woogs and gelly before they left. ok well woogs was the next to leave. we chilled at her house until 3 like the good ol times. i delivered a suprise to the party. it was chata. everyone thought she was arriving that sat but i picked her up on fri. woogs you are already missed. i hope you have a great school year. take care now and see you in dec. you should keep your 626 cell so i can call you more. the next day i helped jexy and chata move into their dorms. it was cool being back to MSMC. i was introduced or should i say reintroduced to many of jexy and chata's friends. oh yeah we also got to see jer e el's slanted room. good stuff. he's not a bad guy. i guess i just needed to give him a chance. after that we ate at wahoos the restaurant with the handicapp dj booth. after that it was off to gelly's house for her good-bye get together. the party people were jexy,gelly, chata, nancy, lisa, kevig, job, andrillo, mandrew, eraz, ryan, jer e el, and ms kintanar. we went swimming and sand some kareoke. fun stuff. but unfortunately it came to an end and we had to say bye to gelly. i wish i spent more time with those three. woogs, joy and gelly if you read this know that you are greatly missed and that i hope you have a good school year. and i can't wait until you guys are here again. jexy and chata are also back in school. so there are only a few left spending their time wondering what they are going to do during the day. damn i know i'm forgetting something but i don't know right now. so i will edit this later if i remember. that is it for now.

-Kevin is the person of the day because he fell into the pool. that was some great stuff. i couldn't believe that he actually fell in but he did. that made my whole day. the guy is too funny. 

Q.O.D.
""One friend in a lifetime is much; two are many; three are hardly possible.""-Heny Adams

------i think this is untrue. i believe that i do have more then three friends. so it is very possible. everyone that i hang with are people i consider my friends. i may be closer to some of them then others but they are all still my friends. maybe mr adams just didn't have many friends. i don't know. but this quote to me is not true at all."

"event","Let me just start off by saying Chick Hearns will live on forever through all of us true fans. I could not believe the news when jexy told me. i had to check it for myself. Chick Hearns is a legend too almost every basketball fan. Like in Agrassive's entry Chick came up with so many sayings for the sport of basketball. If any of you do not believe his influence in basketball i am about to put direct quotes from big names in the sports industry.

""What Chick has meant to the Lakers and the popularity of the NBA basketball in Los Angeles can never be overestimated. His words-eye view is as responsible for this success as any of the great players who have worn a Laker Uniform. We Will be forever grateful to him""------Jerry Buss-Laker Owner

""Quite frankly, I don't know where the organization goes from this point, although we will figure it out.""------Mitch Kupchak-Laker General Manager

""There's never going to be another Chick Hearn. He's a man who will be remembered long after. Some people grow bigger than their sport, bigger than their job. He didn't just support Magic Johnson for what he did on the court. He supported Earving Johnson Jr. When i talked to Chick, a lot of times it was hardly about basketball. He was always so proud of me. I would get little notes from him. That would make me feel so good.""-----Magic Johnson--Laker player 1979-91, '95-96

""Chick was more responsible for the success of the Laker franchise than anyone. Sometimes you just wanted to sit there and listen to him rather than playing Chick was like a father to me.""-------Elgin Baylor---Laker Player 1958-72

""The city of Los Angeles has lost an incredible icon....He was a real joy to be around as a person. He certainly helped me appear to be bigger than life. More importantly, he was a true, great friend.""-------Jerry West--Laker player 1960-74

""It's like losing an immediate family member. He gave me 'Big Game James,' he was the one responsible for my nickname, and I'm known by that nickname everywhere I go.""----James Worthy--Laker player 1982-94

""Though we have lost a dear friend and a true broadcasting legend today, I would like to offer a prayer of thanksgiving for having been able to enjoy his work for all these years. Chick had immense talent that was driven by a tremendous work ethic and an insurmountable passion for the game and his trade. His personality, character and professionalism will be greatly missed, yet his spirit, importance and impact will live forever.""----Vin Scully---Dodger announcer

""Chick understood the essence of the game of basketball like nobody else I can think of. He could just as easily have been a coach or general manager. I just wanted him to go on forever.""-----Al Michaels--Monday Night Football

""The ultimate quality of a champion is to repeat, and that's what Chick did year after year. His greatness as an announcer is a slam dunk. Young announcers can only hope that they can be as good on their best day, as Chick was was every day of the year. He was our connection to the game...It will be difficult for everyone, at the end of games next seasono, not to have a Chick Hearn lock on the refrigerator door. He left us as a champion, the way he would want to go out.""----Dick Enberg--veteran broadcaster

""Twenty-nine years ago, Chick was the one who recommended me for the Kings play-by-play job, and he has been a dear friend ever since. He was an inspiration to sports announcers, not just in Southern California but all throughout the country...I can't believe all that happened to Chick in the last year, but at least his last broadcast was another championship game.""-----Bob Miller---Kings announcer

""Generations of fans were brought to the NBA by the voice and vision of Chick Hearn. From Wilt and West to Magic and Kareem to Shaq and Kobe, Chick was the fixture as the 'Voice of the Lakers' and a legend in his profession. His colorful descriptions of the game transcended the sport and have had an indelible influence on basketball and broadcasting itself.""------David Stern--NBA commisioner

That is not all either. There are so many tributes to him on T.V., radio, newspapers, and the internet. The world has lost one of the best announcers. He worked his way up and finished at the top. He will be truly missed. Laker basketball will never be the same. 

Q.O.D.
""You can put this one in the refrigerator. The door's closed, the light's out, the eggs are cooling, the butter's getting hard and the Jell-O is jiggling.""

"event","ahhh i would have to say thursday was another good day. i started off with jogging like always. saw a guy jogging backwards. kind of funny. i wanted to follow him but he turned on a street that was completely opposite of where i was going. after that i took a shower and picked up my cousins b/c i was going to sign them in at disneyland. work was easy. a nice short shift for me. after that i kicked it with mandrew at his popcorn stand while i was waiting for my cousin's to finish. i was driving them home when my other cousin michelle calls me up crying asking me if i could pick her up from her b/f's house. so i do. even though she is one of the cousins that has been causing me misery i still picked her up. making me late and making jexy wait outside my house. sorry jexy. i rushed home got dressed and it was off to meli boog's house. we met up with meli boogs, pitanar and jonareno. it was off to THE SHACK a ""club"" meli boog's cousin was djing at. when we got there jonareno and i looked way over dressed. the place was like a debut. it was all asians. they did have good music but we were just not feeling it there. so we decide to go to the boogie. that place was so much better. they played some good hip hop but they played that other crap music too. so we went to the other room where they were playing hip hop. we had a good spot too right under the vent so the cold air was on us. fun nite. we saw J to the DO there. we left the club around 1:30 and went to go eat at denny's. then we stopped my woog's house to drop off apu's food and to say hi. didn't stay too long b/c some of us had to wake up early. got home around four. went to sleep like in two seconds. so that was the nite. that was like the third time i have ever been clubbing. it's fun stuff. well with the right people it is and last nite were the right people. so that's it for now.

well this was a hard decision since i did have a great time with four great friends last nite. but i am going with meli boogs b/c she was probably the one who brought this clubbing thing up since it was her cousin who was djing at the shack. she is a great person too. always makes me laugh. she never wants to get anyone mad. unless you really piss her off then you're in for it. just don't talk about her kids. very fun to be around. 

Q.O.D.
""He was awake a long time before he remembered that his heart was broken""
-Ernest Hemingway

well this was a little hard for me to grasp and i still don't know if i understand what mr hemingway is trying to say. i think he is trying to say that sometimes we don't even realize that things have not gone the way we want. and it took a lot of time to realize it. so when you realize it you finally feel the hurt. sometimes it just hurts to realize what is best for two people. i don't know but i have come close to a decision pertaining some matters. but i have changed my mind on this constantly so i don't know. we will see."

the day started off well because she threw the pool party at her house. i probably would have been bored at home if i didn't go there. it was cool to see people too. i wish the whole summer could have been like this. it sucks that people are leaving soon. but we have to enjoy these days that we have left. so gelly i suggest pool party are your house every day. j/k that would be cool though. 

Quote of the Day
""True friendship is like sound health, the value of it is seldom known until it be lost.""
-Charles Caleb Colton

-well i for one can say that this is true. i have messed up friendships in the past. i am just too stubborn to realize it. i know some of my friendships right now are on the losing side right now. hopefully since i have realized this my friendships can be healed. it takes so many things for me to realize this. i hope another tragedy is not needed for me to realize these things. everyone needs friends."

Friday- well this day started with work like most of my days now. it was suprisingly slow on friday. not that many guests showed for the start of the weekend. hey i'm not complaining. after work i went home and waited for the calls to see what will be happining during the nite since chata was here. jexy, chata, and meli boogs came to my house and picked me up. we picked up leenanme and job. it was off to friscos. mandrew, jengas and jongas were there already. that was pretty much it. jexy dropped chata and me at home. chata and i talked until four am. i don't even remember what we talked about. just random stuff. and that was the nite. 

Saturday-woke up and called in sick. no i'm not really sick. went to aunty pena's one year death anniversary. we chilled there until eight. just kicking back having a good time. then it was off to third st promenade. andrillo and i were sort of racing over there. he won fair and square. i'm thinking i could of won but i didn't want to try anything b/c i might of missed the exit. we walked around for a bit then decided to eat at hooters. we just chilled there for awhile. having a merry time. after that we all went home. i dropped of eraz and jengas. said good nite to everyone at leenanme's house. then it was off to home. chata and i were tired so we both went to sleep right away pretty much. well that's it for now.

saturday-i pretty much just worked and then went to my aunt's birthday party. after that i met up with meli boogs and mandrew at black angus to get some desert. after that we went to mandrew's house to watch From Hell. we sent up my tent and watched it while in the tent. it's pretty freaky b/c you wouldn't know if someone was outside the tent. that was pretty much the nite. i took meli boogs home. and it was home for me as well. 

Sunday-uhhh i really don't remember if i did anything. i know i went to work. but as for the other stuff i don't think i did anything. i hope i didn't do anything too fun b/c i would hate to forget that. oh yeah i saw tia and tamera mowry getting on the jungle cruise. that was cool.

Monday-once again the day started off with work. after work it was off to my bowling league. i did pretty well for not bowling for a month give or take a week. next it was off to pathfinder park to meet up with jexy, woogs, meli boogs, mandrew, andrillo, eraz, aunty cynthia, and mr kid pimp. that was fun. we made obstacle courses. then got kicked out of the park. we chilled at woog's house for a little. APU came over as well. we just talked made fun of meli boog's kids. and jengas' kid came up as well. that was the nite. 

Tuesday- Today was just work day. i didn't do anything after work. just chilled at home. my bro and i went to play b/c he is the one that paid for it. that's pretty much it. it was the start of the relaxation for me. 

Wednesday- finally a day off after seven damn days of work. i started the day off with lunch with mandrew and meli boogs. we ate at banana bay. they have some good stuff there. but thai bbq will always be the greatest. after that meli boogs and i were off to poly to pick up del thel. we picked her up and it was off to COLDSTONES. man that is just some great ice cream. adding strawberries to the usual vanilla, caramel, and crunch was a great idea. del thel and i tipped them so they could sing for us. man i'm just gonna go there to tip them and hear them sing. that's so cool. we chilled and talked for awhile. i took meli boogs home and del thel back to poly. after that i chilled at home for a little then decided to treat my bro to dinner. we went to claim jumper and that fool ordered the whole damn menu. and he ate it all. man and all i had was chocolate cake. after dinner jexy and meli boogs picked me up and we decided to go to jengas' apartment. got to meet chun and scott. i met frances before she was there too. scott is cool. it's crazy how he knows the area i live in. we just chilled there and talked about random things like finneus or however you spell his name. after that jexy dropped me at home and that was the nite. it was over all a good day. i had lots of fun.

well that's it for now. tune in next time same BERT channel same BERT time.

PERSON OF THE DAY
ETHEL DEL ROSARIO A.K.A. DEL THEL
it was cool to chill with someone new. we got to know each other a little better. makes me wish i talked to her during the high school years. usually i don't talk that much to people i don't know that well but i felt comfortable around her. she was easy to talk to. hopefully we can chill more someday. make the coldstones trip a monthly thing or something like that.

"event","fourth of july was a pretty good day. the day started off with work for me as always. after work it was off to my cousin's house in that ghetto of a city called beverly hills. i stayed there for a little talking to some friends i haven't seen in awhile. saw gwen and jenine. ate some good food. after that it was off to the rich and safe city of baldwin park. met up with aggrasive, job, sambillo and annie. we bought some fireworks and then used them. aggrasive jr took some good pictures. except for the misleading pic. that was GNAT good. went inside and ate some filipino spahghetti. always good stuff. then it was time for some marble fudge ice cream. just a really great flavor. played some ice bucket. once again i still don't know how the bucket feels like. after that watched some MTB. damn ms. del bianco is hot. one of my goals is to meet her one day. after that aggrassive and i went to load a pic for my live journal. that was pretty much my fourth. 

today i went to work and wondered if anyone was doing anything today. met up with mandrew for a free drink at the inn between. went home and just chilled at home b/c mr santos recieved no calls. got a call from job and woogs. but job was just wondering if there was anything happening and woogs didn't answer when i called her back. even though i called her back like a few minutes after she called. strange happenings? i think so. talking to stahrlia online right now. we are talking about friends. i told her i believe friends are the people you can do anything with anytime and anywhere. no matter what happens. i guess finding out who your friends are is part of life. well that's it for now. tune in next time same bert channel same bert time. i'm audi 5000 yo.

"event","well it's been awhile folks. i'm trying to remember how to work this thing. well rather then go into intricate detail on what has happened in my life since the last time i updated i will give you the significant events that have occured in my life. most of my time has been taken up by work. i've been working earlier shifts so i am in the sun the whole time. damn i'm getting dark. but i'm not complaining b/c there are a lot of people who can't really tan that well so i take it as a gift. i know the jokes will come but unlike job i don't really care. i can't help it. a new person has also entered the life of saint. she goes by the name of stahrlia. she is woog's friend from ithaca. i will refer you to ms. kintanar's last entry for a description of stahrlia. stahrlia is a really cool person. at first she seemed quiet but she opened up as did i when we got to know each other better. no no no not in that way. damn people with dirty minds. while she was here we went to a lot of places with her. to show her around our southern california home. it sucked b/c she had to leave. she had to go back to kentucky. yes folks she lives in kentucky. she is surely missed. but i'm really happy i met her. you know what that was really the only big event that has happened since my last update. meeting this great person that i hope i can stay friends with like all of my other friends. as for a jexy update. well we did talk finally. and i really have nothing to be sad about. i understood completely what she said to me. we will build on what we have. just now is not a good time. damn i really should update more often. well i guess that's it for now. i'm drawing a blank on what else has happened. i'm audi 5000 yo. tune in next time same bert channel same bert time. 

well it may not be funny but here is my thing......
PERSON OF THE DAY: (later on it will be the person that made my day and why, bur right now i will describe one of my friends since it's only 2 pm)
Celia Stahr- i only met her a few weeks ago but i feel like she has been one of my friends for a long time. i usually don't get comfortable around a person as quick as i did with her. she is a funny, smart, pretty, and just a great person. even though she despises that one guy i can look past that. she was very quiet at first so i thought she was one of those east coast snobby people. but i was very wrong. she fits well with our group of friends. like all the other ladies in our group of friends she likes to go shopping i mean most of our site seeing involved a shopping center of some sort. she likes to laugh to. at everything. maybe she thinks everything is funny. i don't know. well stahrlia i know it's not prize winning like ms kintanar's entry but hey i updated. i'll try to update more then once every three weeks."

Probably the greatest Jedi Knight of all. Like Obi Wan, you are wise and keep your feet on the ground at all times. You will not be outsmarted by anyone. You are always faithful to your friends. Be careful though, danger lurks around every corner - you could even be betrayed by those closest to you.<br><br>"

"event","the one thing i want to do in my life and i can't even do it well. i didn't make the mt sac team. i don't even know why i tried. this week is taking too damn long. f*ck i hate myself right now. this was my last chance. no more hope for me to play basketball. so screw it. i'm not gonna try anymore. that goes for everything. this week just keeps getting better. i mean there's what my last entry talks about and my car is messed up again. oh i can't wait to see what else is in store for me this week."

"event","well as of now i am so mixed up on what to feel. outside i seem normal. like everything is good. but on the inside i am really not doing well. i don't know what to think. it's hard. there is this one pressing issue that is killing me right now. people try to help but i'm getting different ideas from these people. they contradict each other. so what am i to do? i thank you people for all of your help though. hopefully i'll figure out what to do. being confused really sucks. i mean your one good source tells you to do one thing then that same source tells you to do the exact opposite of what she told you to do before. ""DO IT!"" then later on it's ""HOLD BACK ON DOING IT"" then the same source says ""I KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW""  this sucks. i finally get the courage to do something then i get shot down. i trust this source so i listen to her. oh well what can i do? that's it for now. tune in next time same bert channel same bert time. GoMeT!!!!!!!!!it's the answer to all our prayers.

"event","Trying to get things done, moving ahead on some things but falling further behind on others. Aaaaah!

Friday was met with whirling snow and freezing roads. It took me two hours to get home. A good chunk of that was just trying to get out of the city in bumper-to-bumper frozen slush. I watched drivers charging ahead as soon as the car in front moved 5 feet. I&#39;m amazed I didn&#39;t witness any accidents. Even when we began to break away into the rural roads, it was difficult. Averaged 40 km/h in an 80 km/h zone, and even that felt too fast sometimes, especially on hills.

Spent a few&nbsp;hours Friday and Saturday night doing work and shipping it out.

At least M. now has their first bank account. The teller was having some trouble with the system. While she was on the phone with the help desk, her &quot;mentor&quot; came in, said something and then followed it up with a tap on the shoulder and a brusque &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me?&quot; I took an instant dislike to her. I always get angry with the petty tinpot dictators drawn to the little fiefdoms where they can exercise their power to make others miserable. I see them in schools with bullying principals, in health care, and this weekend in the bank. Any location where the customer is in fact a supplicant, vulnerable due to age, health or means.

Got new winter boots for M. Took the family to Wal-Mart so M. could get Xmas presents. Had lunch there. E. was terribly frustrated in the toy aisle because I wouldn&#39;t buy anything but kept saying, &quot;Wait until Christmas, see what Santa Claus may bring&quot;. Got the groceries. By that time the kids were flagging and so was I. I still had some errands to do but their importance was vanishing&nbsp;under my fatigue. Came home. Eventually made home-made pizza for dinner.

I had meant to go to a tree-trimming party on Sunday and see a bunch of friends, but ended up cancelling. Bad morning sucked up all the oxygen and I just couldn&#39;t justify the four-hour round-trip. Did some work on the book. Gave E. a hair cut. Got D. to give me a hair cut too as the breakage has been terrible lately.

It sucks that even after coming&nbsp;home for the weekend, doing a bunch of&nbsp;company work,&nbsp;family work and&nbsp;contract work, you still feel behind the eight ball on Monday morning. I need more time and focus to get the book done."

"event","Among the many gift basket inserts and glossies in the paper these days, there was an Oakville magazine for their moneyed residents. I see chunky cylindrical gemstone bead necklaces and bracelets in sterling silver are in, as are fuzzy &quot;faux lamb&quot; or distressed chenille scarves. Check and check. However the look is a bit cold. Earth tones are more my thing.

Also in the paper was a &quot;Classic Creations&quot; mag for a pricey Toronto jewellery store, filled with pictures of&nbsp;malnourished blond females wearing slave-girl bracelets and heavy earrings. The one cool thing I gleaned from there was the vogue to facet&nbsp;pillow cuts&nbsp;of&nbsp;opaque semi-precious stones that normally receive the cabochon treatment, e.g. agate, lapis, opal, moonstone, turquoise and&nbsp;hematite. The agate and turquoise photographed well. Sadly some of the pieces remind me of throat lozenges or Thrills candy... :-)"

Hosted a family from Skrael Friday night. Mother and daughter both entered in Pent, a lot of work. I hope they were comfortable.

Earlier this week I thought my left rear tire was getting a bit soft. Asked Albrecht to look at it, he didn&#39;t agree. Managed to convince myself by Thursday that I was just imagining things. I didn&#39;t drive Friday. Saturday morning, the car fully loaded, everyone clean and prepared, we left on time. Got partway down the street and I could hear the tire dragging. Turned around, deposited the family back at the apartment (E. already wailing) and limped the car to Canadian Tire.

In theory the tire might have been salvageable, but that would have meant lying in snow, trying to extricate the donut (which is mounted under the car and is very hard to remove), jacking up the car and possibly wrenching my back removing and reattaching the nuts before I could go to Canadian Tire to have the tire checked and possibly patched. It all would have taken time, and I had promised to get Albrecht to the event on Saturday. I was not up to it.

Instead I drove it flat the 3 km and was unsurprised to hear it had to be replaced. The clerk on duty was new and eager&nbsp;and scheduled me right in. Watching through the window I was pleased to see the technician check all the other studs after he affixed the new tire.

However that was a cool $175 I hadn&#39;t planned to spend that morning.

Got the family back into the car and we eventually got to the event. At least the blinding snow glare and black ice patches had passed by the time we started driving again. And the kids were able to eat more of their breakfast.

Part of the day did not go well. We were late and missed morning Court. I got the kids and myself dressed, and wrapped Albrecht&#39;s turban (he was going Persian for the day). &#39;Cenedl kindly dropped off my judging sheets. I went into the main hall, found the first entry, and ... it was very crowded. Very noisy.&nbsp; As I sat down&nbsp;someone demanded loudly&nbsp;that we get started. There was a distinct undercurrent of anger at the table.

I suddenly realized I was not up to a fight.

I excused myself.

Had Albrecht return my blank judging sheets to the master table and spent most of the day looking after E. and feeling stupid.

I have judged at KA&amp;S for almost a decade.&nbsp;I&nbsp;judge Pent entries. I judge papers. I judge day-of single entries.&nbsp;I love judging. Not yesterday.

Later I was told by a couple of different people that the negative vibe I sensed progressed to shouting. Maybe I&#39;m not so stupid after all.

I have a certain amount of not-very-useful prescience. It knew before I did that I wouldn&#39;t be home for Hallowe&#39;en (and that therefore there was no point in figuring out a costume). Evidently it also knew I wouldn&#39;t be doing much in the way of judging. I really have got to listen to that voice, because it&#39;s getting more and more reliable as I get older and accrete more data. I sometimes call it my Procrastination power, because generally if I procrastinate there&#39;s a very good&nbsp;reason why, I just don&#39;t know what it is for a while.

I&#39;d&nbsp;like to thank Jhone for coming to me late in the day and asking if I was up to judging &quot;just one thing&quot; so that I wouldn&#39;t feel like my day had been in vain. Tarian happily answered a ton of questions about her lovely stained glass and by gum I did submit one judging sheet after all.

I&#39;d also like to thank Keja for recognizing how crappy I felt&nbsp;for letting them down and reassuring me.

Finally I&#39;d like to thank Jhone and Keja for locating and sending&nbsp;Albrecht and I our judging sheets from last year&#39;s KA&amp;S. That meant a lot to us.

I got to spent time with Rachael and Tangwystl and give them little Xmas presents. Rachael gave me a reproduction Tudor pewter spoon!!! Kuel!

A couple of months ago&nbsp;Albrecht and I made a special trip to the Orange Bag Store and I picked up a piece of dark red silk brocade, even though the pattern wasn&#39;t really period, because you can&#39;t go there and not buy anything. I figure it&#39;s good for a mid-16th century Venetian bodice and sleeves, with a brown cotton velveteen&nbsp;skirt and dark bottle-green velveteen somewhere. It was nice to be able to show it to Tangwystl. One among&nbsp;many projects that are on hold until I get the book done.

The best part of the day was when Albrecht&#39;s research paper, &quot;The Habit of Combat: What Fencers Wore&quot; won first place in the category. (His paper won last year, too!) This year he got a great red riveted suede&nbsp;folder with a little tasselled bag inside containing a mickey (empty). I may induce him to put rum in there, for future reference.

Now we&#39;re sprawled about the living room in various stages of dress, watching the end of Ice Age: The Meltdown for the umpteenth time, nibbling on offerings from Timmy&#39;s and basically avoiding doing anything resembling work. But I foresee coffee will end this blissful state abruptly."

"event","In FB conversation with Larisa, the topic of doing it all came up. She quoted, quite rightly, the culture of &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; as inflicting just as much hurt as beauty magazines do to a girl&#39;s self image.<br /><br />Maybe what&#39;s more worthwhile is declaring what we&#39;ve already done and what we gave up for those things. A recent post by a celebrity blogger essentially admitted that she had to&nbsp;ignore (as in&nbsp;IGNORE, not just put on hold) her husband and kids to keep up on appearances. Which seems to cancel out the accomplishments. Which is more important?<br /><br />As a post-modern woman (per my mother) I try to give attention to the ingredients I have chosen to include in my life. I chose to have a husband. I chose to have kids. I chose to build an&nbsp;engrossing job.&nbsp;I chose to have cats. I choose other things too, but the things that are already here get priority. If I jam too many ingredients in there everything suffers. We all have living standards, but let&#39;s face it, as long as no one gets food poisoning and the kids aren&#39;t cold, there&#39;s a fair amount of leeway on how clean a house actually has to be.<br /><br />Maybe it&#39;s more important to proudly state what we actually did get done in a given day - and what we had to ignore to get those things done. Maybe if we&#39;re honest about the sacrificial backbeat we can get our priorities straight and stop feeling guilty about woulda shoulda coulda looked like Martha Stewart&#39;s airbrushed&nbsp;cat hair-free menu for living.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Today:<br />Stat holiday for me. Got up at 7:30 am. Did some work email. Comforted my daughter who&#39;s been sick and listened to some prattle without getting impatient. Brushed her hair. Helped make&nbsp;sure folks took their medicine. Petted the crazy cat and the sane cat. Put sick husband to bed. Rest of day: TBD but will include a pot roast and work on the book.<br /><br />Yesterday:<br />Woke to a chorus of coughs from the family. Got medicine and juice at Shopper&#39;s Drug Mart. Doctored my family. Attended Remembrance Day Service via TV - if I sing all the songs, stand with the audience, pray&nbsp;and show reverence&nbsp;during the 1.5h service it&nbsp;counts and it&#39;s still an example to the kids. Did&nbsp;2 loads of dishes. Made hot lunch of spaghetti and home made meatballs (deferred from Sat). Cleaned messy spaghetti residue off table and carpet. Got someone to feed and water the cats. Broke one of my prized captain&#39;s chairs, though hopefully it can be fixed. Dropped D. off at long-awaited SkyFall movie. Took kids to Value Village. Bought trinkets and books to build Xmas presents. Got stuff for M.&#39;s Halo costume build. Got kids&nbsp;fruit smoothies from Tim Horton&#39;s (so tired of finding half-eaten double chocolate donuts ground into the seats). Moved furniture around. Scolded kids into shoes and coats so I could pick&nbsp;up D. from the movie. Fended off demands from&nbsp;kids for game tokens so they could play in the arcade. Reheated remains of lunch for dinner. Reminded D. to call relative. Helped supervise kids&#39; computer/XBox time.&nbsp;Alternately broke up/escalated squabbles. Did 2.5h of company work laced with&nbsp;YouTube songs. Wrote a snippet of Remembrance day prose for FB. Snugglebunnies. Oh, and probably had too much caffeine.<br /><br /><b><u>What I didn&#39;t do:</u></b> Get sick (yet). Write for the&nbsp;book, except mental notes. Meaningful personal care. Exercise, unless walking through Value Village counts. Diet.<br /><br />Yes, we have laundry and dishes and recycling to go out. I need to plan Xmas stuff. I need to finish the book before it turns around and eats me."

"event","Back in Canada.<br /><br />I observed the cloud layers as we began our descent from 40,000 feet. The sun was setting behind the plane as we pursued the East. The first thick layer, crumpled, clean and white&nbsp;had obvious currents. Ice floes of cloud circulated between mounded&nbsp;snowy banks. It so resembled spring break-up. Stretches of white were marked with curved paths, like the indentation of feet in soft wet snow. The second layer was finer grained but deeper, with dark gaps over small bodies of water. We passed into a tall misty wall, the demarcation point between sunset and twilight. The final layer was small patchy clouds, broken and stirred.<br /><br />Below I saw neat squares of land, punctuated here and there by a light. No cars. Restful but lonely. Was that the farmland south of the 401? And then, imperceptibly, the glint of mica and pyrites arose, first scattered like flowers to my searching eyes,&nbsp;then joining in orderly patterns and&nbsp;strings of beautiful light. The city a serenely glowing bank of coals. The plane banked considerately in sweep after sweep, displaying its birthplace with pride.<br /><br />Then the controlled scream of descent, the startling bump mid-air as the landing gear were deployed preparatory to landing. Always the whispered prayer of gratitude&nbsp;and hope that we will land safely. We are passing over the highway now, the cars very close and individual, the FedEx crossdocks busy will that truck back in safely? here is the runway DOWN BUMPY SHAKEDOWN ow&nbsp;<i>WHOOHHHHHHHHH </i>as the plane forces itself to slow down.<br /><br />A long ride to the correct gate way down at one end, lurching over the pavement expansion joints. A long wait on this little Jazz plane before they will let us climb down the steps. Somnolent no more, we are all tensed in the aisle or on the edge of our seat, itching to&nbsp;snatch that overhead bag, clear Immigration and find a washroom. The cold night air teases us. The stewardess shivers, wishing they would get on with it.<br /><br />Finally some signal is made and the herd surges forward brusquely. Efficiency is driven by need. We march down the steps and grab the indistinguishable black suitcases from the SkyService rack. I would congratulate myself on my choice of plum, but in this light it too looks black and I feel a momentary stab of panic before I find it, second last on the rack. Back in formation, stomping down the narrow hall separated by glass from the comparatively happy, relaxed people sitting in clumps by the many regional gates. It is a long way to Immigration. The declaration card marked &quot;Do Not Fold&quot; is clenched in my hand as we&nbsp;walk&nbsp;past a gatekeeper sitting on a stool, and finally&nbsp;merge into the stanchion maze that leads to the immigration counters.<br /><br />Glowing signage&nbsp;above repeats over and over,&nbsp;&quot;Welcome to Canada / Bienvenue au Canada&quot;. Smiling attendants sort us into this line and that, but it isn&#39;t busy. I am controlling my relief and near-tears to be entering my own country again. The attendant takes my card, scrawls on it, asks a question and hands everything back. We&nbsp;walk down another hall and hand our marked cards to&nbsp;new attendants. Then we rush towards a great open door with the largest sign, &quot;WELCOME TO CANADA&quot;, and beyond the door the families stand, their smiles in the beckoning darkness stealing into the lighted hall so that you are embraced before you even see them.<br /><br />And you&#39;re home."

"event","It&#39;s technically been a weekend. I remember sleeping in a bit, and slopping around in my pjs on the computer a bunch. But I also remember a long stop at Mr. Lube to get an oil change and a headlight fixed, and&nbsp;driving to Caledon 1.5x (had to turn around just outside Erin and go back to Guelph because I forgot the stupid receipt) to return the unsold Scotchtoberfest booze to the LCBO and to introduce Albrecht to the marvel that is Caledon Burger Co. Darling E. cried most of the trip until she fell asleep. We think she&#39;s fighting off something.

And then&nbsp;today we had to drive all over Guelph in the steady rain (that turned to snow at one shining moment) to pick up a bunch of stuff and buy a (miniature secret NOT) camera and a suitcase and find a pumpkin that wasn&#39;t half-rotten. At the mall the kids were entranced by all the media (Cinema One; HMV; EB Games) and it was just one long gauntlet of NO. So it&#39;s worth celebrating that we hadn&#39;t reached the outright snarling stage by the time we hauled our rained-on groceries into our happy home.

Caledon Burger Co. has very, very good burgers. Their fries are excellent too, cooked in cholesterol-free (?) rice bran oil which they sell by the jug. Skip the bottled Jones pop and get a can of Coke. I wonder if there are any decent antique shops lurking in Caledon East that we could use as an excuse to go there again sometime.

Because I need to take decent photos on the upcoming trip, today we went to Black&#39;s and bought a &quot;Rebel&quot; Canon digital SLR, beginner level that even an idiot like me can probably use. Also got a tripod that&nbsp;I hope will fit into the suitcase once I break it down a bit. And a bag. And a memory card. And a &quot;filter&quot; whose sole purpose apparently is to break and protect the lense when I inevitably drop the camera.

Then I got a dark plum suitcase. In the past 17 years we&#39;ve had a couple of suitcase sets, and the big ones still largely survive, but the little airplane-friendly ones invariably get broken or a cat pees on them, rendering them unusable. Yay. Now I have yet another pretty dark purple thing. I swear, they are really proliferating the last few months.

We also got Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows I and II so as to shut up the offspring. Earlier this year we obtained almost the entire set dirt cheap at The Beat Goes On, but these last two had to be purchased at retail price.

The best moment today, so far, was watching the splatty rain morph into big fluffy wet clumps of snow. By the time we parked at the mall the really and truly snow was&nbsp;flying fast and scudding up the windows. Outside, I realized (1) this coat is too thin; (2) where the heck are my gloves; and (3) I&#39;d better bring a pashmina on the plane.

After the mall crawl we corralled all the groceries so the family won&#39;t starve while I&#39;m out gallivanting. We left pumpkin purchasing a bit late, and the meagre selection remaining at the grocery store was rotting, but we were able to obtain an acceptable specimen at another store nearby. Yet another reason to wash my coat - mud and pumpkin gunk. M. wants this year&#39;s pumpkin to look like a Halo Reach helmet.

I&#39;ve made chili which is now simmering on the stove on low, and there is a big bowl of chocolate pudding in the fridge that I will later cover with Oreo cookie dust and embed with gummie worms. It&#39;s tradition. I won&#39;t be home for Hallowe&#39;en so by golly we&#39;re going to have some of it tonight.

Tomorrow I fly to Minnesota. Hopefully I won&#39;t run into much weather at any point of this trip.

Meanwhile the living room is depressing. Blankets, DVD cases, cookie crumbs, dirty dishes, kleenex, bits of toys, empty pop cans, dirty clothes and general stuff. At least laundry for the trip is in progress, courtesy of the wonderful A."

"event","Had some fun messing up a Grope &amp; Flail&nbsp;roast beef recipe for New Year&#39;s Day.<br /><br />The beef acquisition step was a little silly, though. The recipe called for a 5 lb. rib eye beef roast. I&#39;ve eaten my share of rib eye steaks, but a quick troll of the grocery store revealed no roasts of that kind. I binged the bell at the meat counter and a wannabe butler poked out. I told him what I wanted. He cocked an eyebrow&nbsp;and stated&nbsp;that he didn&#39;t have any and that such a thing would be <u>very</u> expensive, looking me up and down.<br /><br />I showed him the&nbsp;recipe&nbsp;and asked if he could suggest alternative roasts. He said he personally only cooks prime rib roasts, and&nbsp;allowed that he might be able to carve such a roast out of&nbsp;a prime rib...? He made enough comments about the expense that I got annoyed and told him that as a matter of fact I bought two tenderloins for my son&#39;s christening. Thanked him for his time, left the meat counter and grabbed a big&nbsp;top sirloin&nbsp;off the regular rack.<br /><br />You know, he didn&#39;t have to be an idiot about the stupid roast. He could have just said, Sorry, we don&#39;t have any on hand right now. Let&nbsp;the customer&nbsp;decide if it&#39;s too expensive rather than making assumptions. I was properly dressed and shod.<br /><br />Anyway the recipe calls for a bunch of onion and garlic to be pureed with some olive oil. Then you blitz in some rosemary, thyme, parsley and peppercorns. Looks like a rather savoury aioli. Then you anoint the roast with kosher salt and cover it with the aioli and let it marinate for a while. I didn&#39;t want to waste any of the aioli so I ran a little water into the blender and poured it into the pan around the roast. Curiously the mixture smelled a lot like marinating chicken souvlaki, minus the lemon.<br /><br />The original recipe called for half an hour at 450F on a pre-heated pan, but I&#39;d already bedded it down in a casserole dish so I stuck with that. Then 1-1.5h at 300F, depending on the weight. Afterwards you&#39;re supposed to reduce the pan juices with some beef stock and 1/2 cup red wine of a quality appropriate to your social class. That&#39;s where me and the recipe mostly parted ways.<br /><br />I had a bunch of fresh mushrooms to use up and a pan of bacon fat from breakfast, so I sauteed them slowly in the fat with some of the remaining fresh thyme leaves and then let them sweat under a lid.<br /><br />Meanwhile I&nbsp;cut potatoes and carrots into rough chunks and roasted them with butter, pepper, salt and balsamic vinegar at the same time as the roast.<br /><br />When the roast was almost but not quite done I poured the&nbsp;pan juices into the frying pan with the sauteed mushrooms and their liquor, and reduced&nbsp;it&nbsp;hard with the aforementioned declasse&nbsp;(<i>the accent aigu is there if you look hard enough</i>) red wine of an inferior vintage that came from a tetrapak. Placed&nbsp;the beef and vegetables in beautiful serving dishes we got for Christmas, poured the lovely gravy into a bowl and there was dinner.<br /><br />Meat very good, tender and tasty. Coating&nbsp;was a little strong - next time I&#39;ll use a few less peppercorns - but very good nonetheless. Gravy was just excellent, and worked well with the meat and roasted vegetables.<br /><br />Last night for New Year&#39;s Eve we did our annual Oriental dinner on&nbsp;pretty Japanese and Chinese plates we&#39;ve been collecting for years. Very simple this year - grilled teriyaki chicken and a pork stir fry with udon noodles. Jasmine tea. Oranges and apples for dessert. But it looked nice and tasted very good. The chicken especially turned out well this year.<br /><br />Just as we were sitting back from dinner, the town fireworks display began in the park behind our building. We had ringside seats. It was a great little display - lasted about 15-20 minutes. Saw a couple of new firework types I haven&#39;t seen before - great curlicues in gold and silver - and an odd large flower burst that sprouted golden circles at the end of each petal.<br /><br />Then we watched a bunch of Much More Music dance videos, including some mouldy oldies I honestly had never heard before. Tres lame. But it was worth it to see Sir Mix-A-Lot erupt again. Ask a man if he knows any rap music and THAT song will be&nbsp;at or near&nbsp;the top of his list."

"event","Another stupid busy week out of the way.<br /><br />On November 14th&nbsp;I received&nbsp;a scroll assignment - the Pelican for Eyrny Ormarrsdottir, who was elevated at Wassail on Saturday. It&#39;s my first peerage scroll, and I wanted it to be special. Others had kindly provided the wording, so I only had the design to worry about.&nbsp;I thought of adapting the arch of St. Patrick&#39;s Bell Shrine, a late 11th/early 12th&nbsp;C. Hiberno-Norse house reliquary, and of building pillars below to surround the text.<br /><br />Here is an image of the reliquary:<br /><a href=""http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/metal-reproductions.aspx?article=7e17436c-a06e-4d02-9120-a5ae852323f5"">http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/list/metal-reproductions.aspx?article=7e17436c-a06e-4d02-9120-a5ae852323f5</a><br /><br />I was out of town until November 21st. Once&nbsp;I got back home&nbsp;I was obliterated with general work and&nbsp;life insanity. Everybody&nbsp;got sick. As a result&nbsp;I couldn&#39;t start drawing until&nbsp;November 27th.&nbsp;I had to fly out again&nbsp;November 29th so the scroll had to be ready by then.<br /><br />As I sketched the arch in pencil&nbsp;I decided to have it supported by two rams with knotwork horns, for Ramshaven. In contrast to the inspiration piece, I decided to leave a gap open between the arch and the hemisphere (which I had reserved for the Pelican in her Piety) to suggest a coronet, as Eyrny is a Baroness,<br /><br />Once I had the filigree figured out and redrawn with brown ink,&nbsp;I&nbsp;painted it gold using Winsor &amp; Newton gold gouache. It looked rather ethereal, beautiful but insubstantial. I wasn&#39;t sure what to do next, so I took the family to get groceries. Once I got back I decided to paint a small area black. As I painted, the void&nbsp;solutions presented themselves with the end result that the ram bodies became red. Albrecht had looked up Eyrny&#39;s heraldry for me, which was a purple diamond on a gold ground, so I decided to make the top jewel purple and to add purple diamonds to the columns and separate them with alternating red and black bars.<br /><br />I took a break and watched the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe while sketching birds on scrap paper so I could get the angles figured out.<br /><br />The following night&nbsp;I painted the Pelican and her brood. I wanted to suggest knotwork in the mother bird&#39;s winds without having them fight with the arch design, so I brushed simple figure eights but didn&#39;t detail them. I am particularly pleased with&nbsp;how her wings turned out - the flight feathers are separated by narrow unpainted bars, which makes them gleam and look 3-D in person. The baby birds&#39; wings are not quite as arched as I would like for a pair of squawking&nbsp;little leeches :-) but they&#39;re OK.<br /><br />The next morning I had to fly to Winnipeg. I got up early and did the calligraphy. Unfortunately I couldn&#39;t visibly present the phrases as they were written. They were a&nbsp;little too long to fit in the space with the pen I was using. So I had to run the text as a continuous paragraph. Not my preference but&nbsp;I had to leave for the airport in a couple of hours.<br /><br />Lady Brigid Larkin and her lord Henry very kindly brought the scroll to Wassail for me. I hope it went down well, as I was probably passing over northern Ontario when it was bestowed.<br /><br />Here are some pictures:<br /><div><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150502412861060.427766.619731059&amp;type=1&amp;l=b704b87789"">https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150502412861060.427766.619731059&amp;type=1&amp;l=b704b87789</a></div>"

Congratulations to our Pent winner - loved the nettle theme, yummy meat pudding in a turnip, pale pink madder and daffodil yellow linen clothes, naalbinding and research paper.

However the wording is taken care of and I was able to brainstorm a nice design on Thursday night while at the sports bar.<br /><br />To step back a few weeks, when I was assigned to scribe the Thorbjorn&#39;s Hammer award for HE Aeneas Oakhammer it was almost a no-brainer for me to choose the Mammen axe head, which is heavily decorated with niello knotwork. It turned out fairly well - I was pleased.<br /><br />After Winnipeg the next big thing is Calvert&#39;s elevation, but for that all I have to do is drive, dress up, smile and bring scotch. Unless I&#39;m voluntold otherwise.</p>"

"event","<p>Up to my usual nonsense.<br /><br />Invited an SCA friend&nbsp;over this weekend to work on her first medieval-style dress. A couple of weeks ago we went to Fabricland and she found deals on a dark teal blue faux dupioni and a pearl grey tulle for overlay.<br /><br />Something folks tend to forget after a few years in the SCA is that deep yearning to look like a princess. And not with a boughten dress either, but one you&#39;ve sweated and worried over, your first real home made dress. I have seen&nbsp;veterans faced with an eager new person try very hard to push them away from &quot;fantasy crap&quot; into more appropriate silhouettes and fabrics, but it can be&nbsp;self-defeating. The person may go along with the more experienced&nbsp;suggestions, but be vaguely dissatisfied and disappointed with the results.&nbsp;Many women have a vision or visions of their perfect dress and the sooner they can get out there and try to make it the way <i>they</i> see it the happier everyone will be.<br /><br />As far back&nbsp;as grade 5, maybe&nbsp;earlier, I drew my perfect dress as a (crushed) royal blue velvet dress with square neckline, dropped waistline and full skirt. I was lucky that when I eventually found the SCA I also found a person who was willing to make my idea with very little alteration other than that I could not afford blue velvet and instead got some blue polyester weave that was actually very hard-wearing and is probably still out there&nbsp;if not&nbsp;in the Gold Key in the sky.<br /><br />But before that dress, which I wore happily for years,&nbsp;I found some sparkly purple and silver crap, sewed it together by hand into a travesty of a Florentine gown and wore it with pride (and scuffed black pumps, alas) for several months until the silver started to wash off. I still have it in my drawer. The colours were just like a silk-screened scarf, that soft blurred water-colour&nbsp;of pansies in&nbsp;rain. And, bless them, no one said a nasty thing.<br /><br />You kind of have to get it out of your system.<br /><br />Tomorrow we are having some folks over for dinner and a chat so we can understand some stuff better and get&nbsp;our innings in privacy without being shouted down. Nicolaa said once that&nbsp;the SCA has systemic communication problems: boy, does it ever. And I&#39;m not even talking about the issues down the street; this is a whole different kettle of fish.<br /><br />The good part, for me, is that I don&#39;t feel punched in the gut by this week&#39;s events. I feel that I can continue to play my game according to my terms whether or not certain other things change or not. I wish to protect those who may be unknowingly hurt by the crap going on, and hopefully all will be well, but even if it isn&#39;t I am pretty sure I will still be on a fairly even keel.<br /><br />I am so in love with the Lost in Translation soundtrack. And with Debussy&#39;s Clair de Lune. And with Leonard Cohen&#39;s voice.&nbsp;I even love Kung Fu Panda&#39;s music (Oogwey Ascends). Something about the haunting Asian tonal scale. Such rich, eloquent, accepting sorrow.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYQcGQpyoM"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVYQcGQpyoM</a><br /><br />I am reminded of a jewelled piece I saw at the Maharajah exhibit at the ROM earlier this year. It was a small ruby and gold&nbsp;sculpture of a (presumably) Hindu goddess. This very&nbsp;small piece, hidden in a niche in the exhibition, somehow <i>breathed</i> the same protective devotion and awe that I would consciously <i>project</i>&nbsp;upon a sacred piece&nbsp;from my own religion. It must have been loved and cherished for centuries. How can I say it? I had no trouble identifying it as something deserving&nbsp;my spiritual respect although it is not from my faith.<br /><br />We have been having a lot of fog lately. It was -5C in Milton Friday at 8:12 am. The fog is different every day. Beckoning halls of mist: that, as you advance, diminish.<br /><br />I often wonder if I will enter another world when my car drives into heavy fog. And then wonder how I will get back. Or if the world will be of my own devising and will let me bring in my loved ones, a distant golden manor, surrounded by gardens and sweet music.</p>Good Lord, I don&#39;t remember Lost in Translation including Rick James&#39; &quot;Love Gun&quot; before! Must get Albrecht to buy some tight gold satin pants.<br /><br />I spent a small fortune on ThinkGeek today. Birthdays and Christmas to take care of. We have mondo plans for next weekend which are being kept secret from The Boy.<br /><br />Also there is far too little&nbsp;rum in the house. Again.<br /><br />I really need to do some scroll layouts for the Boke of Memories. Have a bunch of ideas in my head to play out. I&#39;ve been fabric-focussed lately (we organized all the bins last weekend) and all the bogged-down projects are now sitting in a blanket chest in front of the couch. It&#39;s full. So theoretically that means I need to finish some of them before I start others. At least I know where they all are. Let&#39;s see what they are:<br /><ul><li>Albrecht&#39;s black velvet brocade suit of clothes (about 2/3 done)</li><li>My reversible Tudor dress in crimson red silk with black accents that reverses to grass-green brocade with cream dupioni silk (about 1/2 done)</li><li>My reed corset (about 1/3 done)</li><li>Albrecht&#39;s purple wool hosen (about 1/2 done several years ago but then the moths got at some of it)</li><li>Albrecht&#39;s linen shirt with blackwork (about 1/2 done but the proportions are terrible&nbsp;and the blackwork minimal. In fact the blackwork was so hard on my eyesight I&#39;ve done nothing on it since M was a baby - yes)</li><li>Somebody else&#39;s 2/3 done project that they would like me to help with (kind of a guilt transfer)</li><li>Albrecht&#39;s brand-new doublet and slops in wool and linen (fully cut out but not yet assembled)</li></ul><p>And I&#39;ve forgotten what else is in there.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I showed someone how to make a simple half circle cloak. I didn&#39;t have a measuring tape with me so we used a long piece of cord he had in his backpack to describe a half-circle. I helped him pin the beginning of the hem and make a few stitches, then let him at it. He came back this week with a fully functional cloak, hood and closure. He was so proud of himself. It was great. He even finished it in time for Hallowe&#39;en!<br /><br />So next weekend is a big family deal. Then I fly down south for a week. As soon as I land on Friday afternoon I need to drive to Gan (KA&amp;S is the next day), so I need to ensure the car is properly packed before I go to the airport a week Monday. Then I&#39;m back for a week. Then I go out west for most of a week, then Suzanne comes down, and then the following weekend we&#39;re driving to Calvert&#39;s Pelican ceremony in Buffalo (what to wear? oh what to wear??) and then it&#39;s time to get ready for Xmas. At least the vacation allotment restarts Jan. 1.</p>"

"event","Just got through a big week! And no temper tantrums yet! (knock on wood)

Crown was on Saturday. Mega Practice was on Sunday. A&amp;S/Post Rev was on Sunday. 5 house guests. No waiting, I mean resting. We love having friends over and feeding them. With Albrecht&#39;s work schedule we try to maximize our weekend opportunities, but we almost bit off more than we could chew.

We had already arranged to hold a Fencing/Dance mega practice in der Welfengau on the Sunday. And we hadn&#39;t an A&amp;S Sunday in a few months so I offered to hold one, as a kind of post rev after the Mega Practice.

We heard our&nbsp;dear friends from Skrael needed crash space for Crown. We love to have them over, so we arranged to put the 3 of them upstairs. Then Archibald and Jocelyn needed space, so we assigned them to the living room. Meanwhile we found out that the shower in M&#39;s bathroom had suddenly lost all water pressure, so the push was on to get that repaired before Friday.

And much cleaning was on the agenda as well. We continue to cull stuff post-toddler and I had bags and boxes to get out the door.

Here is how last week read, not including our regular work and family commitments. Throughout Albrecht was cleaning like crazy.

Tuesday night: Albrecht taught Heraldry/Persona Names at der Welfengau. I dropped off stuff at Value Village, got gas, retrieved the extra van seats from the storage locker, and bought new pillows at Wal-Mart. Most of it while E was asleep in her car seat. Thank heaven, no crying.

Wednesday night: Fabricland trip in a drenching&nbsp;cold rain. Only one person of the 4 expected showed up, alas, but I got them into some nice fabric for a 14th century -esque ensemble. Fabricland was having a buy 1, get 2 metres free, so I collected a lovely, subtle chocolate plaid wool to make Albrecht a new doublet and slops. It worked out to $8/metre. A really nice fabric. Compile the 11 separate sections of Pattern paper into single Word document (290 MB) and copy to thumb drive so I can later print it at Staples. Swear repeatedly at ancient laptop.

Thursday night: Albrecht working. Groceries, including supplies for our house guests, Mega Practice commissariat stuff, and ingredients for the A&amp;S/Post Rev. Managed to stay under household budget somehow.

Friday night: Albrecht working. Plumber comes and fixes water supply. Very tidy hole around taps, cover with plastic sheeting until they can replace the tile. Buy new shower curtain (as old one has been shredded by cats) and dark red flannel bedding (score a sale!) and more commissariat supplies. Get&nbsp;cash. Cut and sew big sleeves for latest houppelande. Finished! (Though I still want to cut strips of dark red silk to decorate&nbsp;the centre seams. J calls. Packed Scroll of Honour and my illumination binder for the A&amp;S roundtable. Packed my in-progress apron dress and sewing basket. Skrael friends arrive a little after midnight just&nbsp;beat&nbsp;and crawl into bed.

Saturday: Albrecht working. Pick up 3 der Welfengau ladies and drive them to event. Help orient them during the day. Exhibit Scroll of Honour in the blessedly warm upstairs room. Fell half a seam on apron dress using dark red wool laceweight yarn. der Welfengau ladies try out dancing! :-) Watch second half of tournament. Wow! Pretty intense! Edward the Red wins! Attend Court. We had 9 people from der Welfengau present. TE Ramshaven recognize our newbies! :-D Drive the ladies home to Guelph. Scarf down delicious bowl of pork and noodle stir fry prepared by wonderful Albrecht. Jocelyn and Archibald arrive. Lucia and her ladies arrive. She mentions bunz is playing with pigments, so I grab some of my new dark blue lapis and throw it in a baggie for her to turn into ultramarine. People are tired and everyone goes to bed pretty quick.

Sunday: Smack arm really hard trying to come down the stairs quietly at 7:30 am, waking up Archibald. Make tea/coffee and breakfast for guests. Drive Albrecht, fencing equipment and supplies to Mega Practice at the University. Freaking cold at 9 am, only +2C and frost on cars. Zoom back, do Tim&#39;s run&nbsp;and cook&nbsp;more breakfasts as others wake up. Eat breakfast myself. Enjoy leisurely bitch session with Lucia et al (Thank you!) until they need to get on the road.

Start cleaning and cooking for A&amp;S/Post Rev. Bake chocolate cake for Black Forest Trifle. Devin arrives and starts work on the Persian coat for Niall. Cook filling and assemble mega lasagne. H calls. Too busy to talk with her long but hopefully she did not feel blown off. Play assorted music, get a little weepy but not too much. Assemble trifle and chill in fridge. Make breading for chicken thighs. Discover&nbsp;covered bowl of grey turkey bits in fridge, throw out contents. Developing slow burn. Albrecht calls, will be ready to come back soon. Food is in oven when I leave to get him, I turn down heat, but unfortunately it dried out a little&nbsp;before we got back. Crap! Still quite good but it would have been so much better.

When we arrive 2 ladies are already there for the A&amp;S and Devin has supplied them from the library. Awesome! Other folks arrive and we scarf down lots of food. Devin gets through a huge amount of her caftan project. Other ladies find ideas in books and work on finestrella sleeves. Watch the new Robin Hood. I am exhausted, leafing through book on old English needlework and idly noting author&#39;s poor opinion of American quilting. Silently tell long-dead author to go f___ themself. Go upstairs and lie down on E&#39;s bed and wait for movie to be over so I can drive folks home (bus service ends at 6 pm on Sunday here). Doze off. Albrecht wakes me up and I take 4 people home. Gas tank is almost dry. It&#39;s 10 pm. I go back home and go to bed.

Today I reconciled a massive project and got most of the way through a monthly report. Ate satisfying dinner of leftover lasagne and trifle. Mmmmm. Next stop: Hallowe&#39;en."

"event","I run into the Virtues discussion fairly regularly but never feel&nbsp;part of the picture because the moral priorities&nbsp;I seek&nbsp;don&#39;t seem to really fit the list. Once I heard about the Norse list I felt a little better (thanks Hector for that Ursus article)&nbsp;but I&#39;m not 100% sure my virtues have a home.

So here&#39;s my take:

Hard Work
No matter what, if I work hard I know I will get there. I don&#39;t respect it when people&nbsp;go part way and then languidly fall back in feigned exhaustion. Hard work is a virtue. Its&nbsp;crucible of self-denial&nbsp;proves my commitment.

Love
I think love is too easily dismissed and limited in scope to&nbsp;spousal&nbsp;and close family relationships. I think real love for friends and colleagues is possible and inspiring. Love makes burdens light and helps make it easier to see and do what is right.

Passion
I feel strongly, and as a frequently intuitive person I believe it is a strength.&nbsp;To be sensitive to beauty and goodness, to shed tears over evil and injustice, and to harmess&nbsp;that&nbsp;energy to drive my response is not, to me, a weakness. I don&#39;t strike blindly but I bear the emotion like a flag before my eyes. You can&#39;t write poetry without passion.

Independence/self-reliance
Doing things alone proves my worth and ability to do them at all. Yes, I know how to be a team player. And I know how to take things under my wing and be responsible for them and make them happen.

Faith and Hope
To me these are almost the same. Faith requires a future to have a point. And hope opens the door.

Loyalty
This is more often disparaged than used, because it ties you to someone or something who may not return the favour. But to date the work I have done in the name of loyalty has not repaid me ill. Loyalty lets me pass over the rough spots without bailing. It can be a necessary bridge of tolerance.

Courage
This I think everyone can agree on.
It&#39;s telling my husband everything will be all right while I am rolled into surgery for an emergency c-section. It&#39;s promising to teach a class somewhere in Ohio to people I have never met. It&#39;s receiving friends&nbsp;at my father&#39;s funeral with my smile in place for the sake of my mother."

"event","<p>&quot;My brain is trying to kill me&quot; (Calvin &amp; Hobbes, c. 1984)<br /><br />Sometime in July my evil brain decided that I didn&#39;t have enough to worry about (probably while I was&nbsp;drinking rum coolers in a pool chair somewhere in northern Ontario).<br /><br />It occurred to me on Thursday that I am completely booked between now and New Year&#39;s, and 2012 isn&#39;t looking much better. The following list is is in addition to working full time, driving 2 hours a day and looking after my family. Also I normally plan on doing a scroll per event minimum but may have to drop the ball here and there.<br /><br /><b><u>October:</u></b><br />A WHOOOLE bunch of der Welfengau activities all month<br />Thanksgiving cooking (at my house&nbsp;it deserves its own line)<br />Finish my two papers for KA&amp;S (yay, I did manage to review Albrecht&#39;s paper last night)<br />Gan trip; booty to bring back.&nbsp;700 km weekend.<br />Crown Weekend: host friends;&nbsp;A&amp;S display; Mega Practice; Post-Rev; A&amp;S Sunday. Must plan the cooking wisely so I don&#39;t freak out.<br />Hallowe&#39;en costumes<br /><br /><b><u>November:</u></b><br />Even MORE der Welfengau stuff this month<br />Toronto trip for family birthday<br />Week-long trip to U.S. for new book contract<br />KA&amp;S Pent judging / Gan side trip<br />Winnipeg trip for work meetings and all that entails/entrails; visit family<br /><br /><b><u>December:</u></b><br />May miss Wassail due to family visit<br />Calvert&#39;s Pelican vigil<br />Xmas arrgh<br /><br /><b><u>2012:</u></b><br />April: TE Septentria&#39;s Boke of Memories (ongoing job; this is just the deadline)<br />Lots of work on new book<br />We have been talking about a UK trip but are having some motivational problems. It may turn into a&nbsp;week in Toronto instead sans responsibilities. I&#39;m ashamed to say that Toronto sounds like more fun right now.<br /><br /><u><b>Ongoing:</b></u><br />Ealdormerean Scroll of Honour - assignments and showings (low impact fortunately)<br /><br />But despite all this I keep starting new garb projects. Cut out a new apron dress today (first in 7 years) and got the back gore inserted. Nice light grey wool with fine dark red and double white pin stripes. I joked that people will confuse me with Eyrny if I wear this over my red linen tunic. Want to fell the seams on the outside with red&nbsp;thread for Norse-y impact. I have some dark red silk thread but not sure if it will work.<br /><br />Had an excruciating trip to Huntsman&#39;s Harvest today. It&#39;s not far but I took the wrong turning at the fork because I was singing an emotional song and arguing with the family. All my fault. Ended up in downtown Hamilton where I have never been before. All one-way streets and signs that are too small. Took forever to find our way back to Highway 6, even using the combined might of paper directions,&nbsp;the event website, iPhone mapping utility and the kind teenager running the counter at the Farah Gas Station (may your tribe increase).<br /><br />Felt better once we landed but OMG what a horrible drive. Wasted a bunch of gas and incalculable emotional energy. Bleah.</p>Displayed the Scroll of Honour. Cut out the apron dress and sewed it a little. Sang snippets of Mumford &amp; Sons to Mistress Marian of Heatherdale. Experienced randomized guilt and worry. GOT ACCUSED OF BEING TOO QUIET AGAIN WTF. M. shot arrows and played hide-and-seek with other kids who seemed to be on the same wave length. E.&nbsp;swung on the swings and slid down the slides and ate every snack in the cooler. Albrecht fenced in a tournament and played some very fun pick-up.<br /><br />This morning I had made two loaves of chocolate walnut bread. 3 of us&nbsp;liked it but&nbsp;M. said &quot;I don&#39;t eat nuts&quot; and&nbsp;left. On our way out I gave one of the loaves to the gal running the mead tasting as we decided we couldn&#39;t stay for the potluck feast. D. provided means for Thai back home, so we ate too much after all.<br /><br />Tomorrow I get to buy clothes for myself. This has not happened in a while. I hope it is fun. Crepes are also involved. I hope they don&#39;t suck and at least peripherally resemble those on Queen Street West.<br /><br />I am sick of being told I am too quiet. Among the many other reasons I have posted for being quiet, I will add that I am often quiet because I wisely doubt that what I have to say will be welcome. I may have to make a smart remark or two before They get the point.<br /><br />Geez."

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: larger"">I wonder how much of endeavour is still goaded by an imagined, distant hall of judgement, by relentless, invisible, pitiless&nbsp;scrutiny. <br /><br />And its corollary: I&nbsp;wonder if my idealism is really misplaced. The shape I&nbsp;keep trying to discern is waxing depressing again.<br /><br />*** <br /><br />Trying to get ready for our &quot;Victorian Tea with gothy overtones&quot; party next Saturday. Haven't had much uptake yet - two of the four confirmed attendees live in the house, so I'm concerned. <br /><br />Last weekend I&nbsp;finished the skirt for the Victorian afternoon ensemble I'm making in frosty pink dupioni silk. Based on extant finds pieces and patterns&nbsp;in Janet Arnold's Patterns of Fashion (Victorian period). Drafted a muslin for the jacket bodice on Tuesday night.&nbsp;Unfortunately haven't accomplished much since, hope to remedy that once I&nbsp;get some other things out of the way. <br /><br />I&nbsp;picked up the dupioni at Affordable Textiles while on our King Textiles Toronto run. Also found some lovely matching trims at Mokuba. After blowing my brains out on the price of the silk (stupidly succumbed to peer pressure) I exercised considerable restraint at Mokuba and at least salvaged part of the day.<br /><br />Last night I&nbsp;went to a party at Dubhessa's. Lovely food, nice folks to chat to. Earlier in the day I&nbsp;took the kids out for a mega grocery run as we were out of a lot of things. Back home was able to get my hair refreshed and even paint my nails hot red for a change.<br /><br />I also ordered some lapis lazuli and coral chip beads from Fire Mountain Gems. Want to crush them for pigments and see what happens on a scroll. Although the coral chips are probably dyed (tried to get natural ones but I&nbsp;fear that I&nbsp;failed) the colour is close to red lead. With a family and animals I&nbsp;have withheld from the poisonous pigments but if I&nbsp;can find an acceptable quasi-period substitute then it could be fun. I&nbsp;also tried to ensure the lapis is a dark blue for maximum punch.<br /><br />Albrecht is assistant super in our building. Yay money! His first night: sometime around 3:30 am a pair of idiots&nbsp;tore the alarm bell off the wall, uncoiled the fire hose, sprayed extinguisher all over ...&nbsp;and left a lighter in the fire box. Called the incident into the police.<br /><br />We're hoping to go to the UK&nbsp;next early spring. Have wanted to go since we first met. He wants to visit the Leeds Armouries, I&nbsp;want to see the V&amp;A. Need a couple of good castles. I&nbsp;also need to visit Tintagel, Lindisfarne, sing in a pub in Dublin and be in Scotland. Will have to probably take 9 days to do what we need to do. Have to compile the sites&nbsp;and plan an itinerary.&nbsp;TG for Google, Expedia etc.<br /><br />I have the tendency to pick up accents very quickly on a temporary basis (e.g. after watching an Irish movie) so it should be funny to listen to me on the trip. I&nbsp;hope he can record me being stupid that way a few times, for our mutual&nbsp;amusement after we get home.<br /><br />I dreamed that I&nbsp;needed badly to rid someone I&nbsp;loved of a terrible curse. We journeyed into Eastern Europe, beset by demons, on the scent of a Blue Shrine in the Ukraine that could lift the curse. I&nbsp;remember entering the dark magnificent sanctuary, flickering with candles. We were approaching the large niche on the left hand side of the altar. I have the impression of a raised&nbsp;square shrine paved with dark blue tesserae, quietly gleaming in the gold-pooled light. Before we could reach it I&nbsp;woke up.<br /><br />I&nbsp;want to find that shrine.</span></p><br />"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium"">Late in May Nicolaa asked me via the Signet if I would like to do a scroll for the Gunther. I&nbsp;naturally said yes but at that point I had no idea what the award was. About a week later I found out it was for a Court Barony.<br /><br />Gunther is a good friend of ours and there are many things that we would like to honour.<br /><br />I looked over my inspiration books for a week or so.&nbsp;I knew&nbsp;Gunther liked the scrolls I have been doing based on&nbsp;early period metal artifacts. By the time Murdee Melee came around I knew it was going to be a two page scroll, each 11x14 pergamenata.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had decided to do a carpet page and an incipit page (the concept seen so clearly in the Lindisfarne Gospels). The carpet page would be an adaptation/build-out of the Sutton Hoo shoulder clasp. As for the incipit I had thought to make it very Lindisfarne-y, but more on that anon.<br /><br />Although I hadn't yet started to draft the main&nbsp;wording, I had&nbsp;dreamed up a key line - &quot;I&nbsp;will be the Kingdom's Man&quot;. This line was going to be visually separated from the rest of the text and&nbsp;specially calligraphied using the Lindisfarne composite letterform.<br /><br />While at Melee I gave Nicolaa a verbal rundown of what I was planning to do and she was tres cool with that. So off I went.<br /><br />The first thing was to rule out margins on the pergamenata. I don't have a slanted drafting board.&nbsp;I do everything on the dining room table with a flexible see-through ruler and a hard point pencil.&nbsp;I got both pages marked with 1.5&quot; margins. I wasn't quite sure yet how to handle the incipit or text page so I ruled .25&quot; margins most of the way to the top on that one and left it for the moment.<br /><br />For the carpet page, as mentioned I&nbsp;had decided to use the Sutton Hoo shoulder clasp. It is a magnificent piece of jewellery, red garnets on gold and beautiful millefiori&nbsp;wafers of blue, black and white glass set in gold stepwork, topped by an outstanding pair of garnet boars and framed by garnet zoomorph knotwork, all on gold.&nbsp;Outstanding both technically and artistically.<br /><br />Here is a picture from Flickr:<br /><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/thursday_dave/2357914145/"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/thursday_dave/2357914145/</a><br /><br />While building my pencilled grid for the central stepwork panel, I&nbsp;had some issues of my own. First, the extant shoulder clasp is based on odd numbers whereas I was using 4 x 4 based on the dimensions of the paper and my preference for measuring things by the quarter inch. So this meant a lot of subtle differences to keep the grid balanced. Different motif repeat (even, not odd, which can really affect your colour balance). Diamond shapes to connect the motifs instead of a single line of stepwork. And different fills for the motifs.<br /><br />Here is the initial&nbsp;grid. I don't use graph paper so this is all from scratch.<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/00016pab/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/00016pab/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />Then I&nbsp;had to decide how to visually differentiate the motifs similar to&nbsp;the cloisonne glass in the original but on a different system. While the extant piece only has a couple of&nbsp;patterns plus the plain red, I ended up with 5.&nbsp;I had decided not to use red motifs as there would already be a lot in the surrounds and I needed to balance it with the blue/black/white more so than in the original. Once I was finished I marked the motifs with a brown micropen.<br /><br />Here is the final grid:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/000170r3/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/000170r3/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />An interesting feature of Migration/Ostrogothic/Anglo-Saxon metalwork is their fondness for garnet inlays over gold that has been scored in a regular pattern, which adds light and some sparkle to what can be a very dark&nbsp;though rich and beautiful&nbsp;gem. The same technique was found in the Staffordshire Hoard pieces dug up a couple of years ago.<br /><br />Rather than painting the red areas of the grid in a straight fill, I decided to echo this jewellery technique&nbsp;by marking my unused grid&nbsp;lines with a red micropen&nbsp;and then painting each cell individually.<br /><br />As I began to paint the red cells I experimented with the gouache mixture. I&nbsp;normally use a combination of cadmium red and quinacridone red as the first gives depth and opacity while the second gives colour and lightness.&nbsp; By itself, cadmium red tends to turn a sort of clay colour and has no fire. In contrast, quinacridone is on the orange-y translucent side. But mixed together they give a good quality dark red.<br /><br />Initially I didn't get the mix quite right. I rationalized that since I was painting the cells hopscotch to avoid running, the variances that naturally resulted as I&nbsp;firmed up the mix or as the mix became paler (due to refreshing with water as it dried in the seashell I was using) would actually add to the rippling jewelled effect I was trying to create. And more or less that was the case! :-)<br /><br />Initially I had thought to paint the connecting diamonds pale ultramine blue to match what I was intending for the motifs but I decided on gold and I'm glad.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001807t/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001807t/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />Now, as Gunther has been a Guardsman of the Royal City of Eoforwic, I knew the boars would be perfect as <em>eofor</em> means boar. I added knotwork trilliums to the base of the carpet page to represent&nbsp;Ealdormere. I was hoping to use bear's heads in the knotwork panels but that did not turn out as I&nbsp;will later relate.<br /><br />Meanwhile I&nbsp;was trying to draw the&nbsp;darn boars. I was having trouble balancing the shapes, and had to&nbsp;sketch them a couple of times before they really took form.&nbsp;When they were properly balanced I used the brown micropen to fix them. As I lined the eyes the boars&nbsp;came alive. It was an odd, almost mystic&nbsp;feeling that I was performing a rite.<br /><br />Now my work on these scrolls really didn't begin until after Melee. I&nbsp;was working on the scrolls most weeknights&nbsp;after dinner and almost all day on weekends. But I hadn't figured out any wording yet.<br /><br />I&nbsp;knew I didn't want to do a conventional wording. Part of a scroll's magic for me is the reversal&nbsp;of time through poetry. The less modern-sounding intrusions or bureaucratese the better, yet these are official documents with specific requirements to make them SCA-legal.<br /><br />So I sat down one weeknight with Beowulf (original + modern translation) and a couple of other books I have on Anglo-Saxon poetry. I knew I wouldn't have a problem generating good alliteration and assonance but I wanted to check the rhythms and how they are deliberately broken for emphasis.<br /><br />The nice thing about Beowulf is that even though the word endings have changed, the English speech patterns haven't.&nbsp;And even though I couldn't read the words I could read the letters and get a feel not just&nbsp;for the alliteration but for how the phrases varied in length.<br /><br />Once I&nbsp;felt I had the style cold, I went upstairs and sat on the bed for a couple of hours writing down homonyms and fragments of phrases that could represent the many things that Gunther has done over his twenty years in the Society. Albrecht and Elizabeth eventually came up and we did our free-association vocabulary game (&quot;think of words that start with T&quot;, etc.). The game usually deteriorates very quickly into potty talk and Elizabeth didn't understand why we were laughing so hard. I didn't really come up with any extra words that were fit to use so&nbsp;I left my pages to marinate.<br /><br />A few days later I sat down and assembled my bits and pieces. I knew I wanted to express a progression from Boar to Bear to Wolf (Canton to Barony to Kingdom) in conjunction with Gunther's maturation in the Society as an experienced warrior with heavy&nbsp;administrative chops and fine personal qualities.<br /><br />I also wanted to keep the award itself a secret until the very end.<br /><br />When I was finished it made me cry.<br /><br />Here is the final version.&nbsp;I have bolded the main examples of alliteration and assonance, although there are several other examples of internal rhyme or rhythm.<br /><br /><p

But, to date, I hadn't decided on a particular letter to emphasize in the Lindisfarne style.<br /><br />Now early in the game Albrecht&nbsp;had enlisted the unknowing services of our friend&nbsp;Silke, now HRM&nbsp;Drachenwald, and Lino da Napoli to translate my phrase, &quot;I will be the Kingdom's Man&quot; into German. I ended up choosing Lino's version, <span lang=""EN-CA"" style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"">&quot;Ich sol des k&uuml;nicr&icirc;ches dienstman s&icirc;n&quot; </span>, done in Middle High German as I liked the nuance of choice and willing vassal that Lino explained in his commentary.<br /><br />I had planned to place the phrase at the bottom of the incipit scroll but I was nagged by a feeling that it would look bulky and take more than one line to execute in full Lindsifarne composite.<br /><br />Then I had a brainstorm. I would make the incipit page look more like an Anglo-Saxon treasure binding or Irish book shrine such as the Lough Kinale or Cumdach. I decided that&nbsp;the four corners would be guarded by intensely coloured roundels matching the glass studs&nbsp;on the handle mounts of the Ardagh Chalice.<br /><br />See the third image on the following link:<br /><a href=""http://homepage.eircom.net/~asduchasdochas/gatewaywest/ardagh/html/chalice.htm"">http://homepage.eircom.net/~asduchasdochas/gatewaywest/ardagh/html/chalice.htm</a><br /><br />I also decided the connecting borders would be filled with the German phrase painted in gold, as shown here (upside down), with the Royal signatures in cells at the bottom completing the border.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/000197cr/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/000197cr/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />And here:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001azzy/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001azzy/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />You can see where I&nbsp;changed my mind on the where the Kingdom seal should go. Instead I placed it dead centre and surrounded it with a border adapted from an Anglo-Saxon brooch. Now the original is solid colour but in this case I decided to leave it partially natural to refresh the page when surrounded by black calligraphy.<br /><br />The gold Lindsifarne calligraphy looks embossed. When doing small fills I like the gouache to be thick so it stands proud of the surface. It makes it look real.<br /><br />Time was running short. I&nbsp;was still trying to figure out the knotwork. I had planned two days vacation so we could do the full Trillium event and at 2:00 pm on Wednesday I reluctantly packed away the scrolls and threw together a field kit so I&nbsp;could finish onsite. Here is where they stood at 2:00 pm:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001bthe/""><img border=""0"" width=""640"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001bthe/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />At one point I was so stymied by the knotwork that I&nbsp;even tried to take a tracing from a print-out of the Sutton Hoo piece.&nbsp;The scale was all wrong so I threw it away and forced myself to get it right.<br /><br />My problem was trying to get the lines of knotwork to flow but still retain that jagged angular feeling that the real thing contains. Modern knotwork usually looks wrong - it's too smooth and regular and lacks&nbsp;edge.<br /><br />You can also see smudging on the carpet page, right hand side near the middle. Feeling ignored despite lots of interim cuddles, my white cat leapt onto the table, put one paw spang into the middle of the seashell containing red gouache and then onto the scroll. Happily most of it could be covered up, though some lines were coarsened. Yes, he is fine.<br /><br />Later on site I realized that just using my brush and twisting it would broaden the line and give it the flow that I&nbsp;wanted but couldn't achieve by trying to manually double my pencil lines.<br /><br />I did try to fill the gaps with Bear's heads but nothing worked so I did a simple knotwork&nbsp;fill and called it good.<br /><br />I was also painting gold like crazy. It is not always even in terms of depth, which makes me sad, but I was short of time&nbsp;despite all the work I had already done.<br /><br />At Trilliums I spent 4 hours Thursday and another 4 hours Friday finishing the painting. At one point Gunther was around but not paying attention.&nbsp;Friday night&nbsp;I did the calligraphy in about 40 minutes using the half-uncial version I have developed. Shortly afterwards I delivered the scrolls to Nicolaa, who was conveniently Signet on Scene (and who therefore got a sanctioned sneak peek :-)<br /><br />I tried to relax, but could hardly sleep for trying to imagine how the theatre would go down in Court. Couldn't eat dinner Saturday night when I was cooking steaks (a sneaky way to keep Gunther on site until Court). As they live so close to the site there was a danger he would go home, and once there, be hard to drag back.<br /><br />Anyway. He was gotcha'd but good. The wording sounded OK in court and the scrolls looked great.<br /><br />Here are the final framed versions:<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001c99e/""><img border=""0"" width=""506"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001c99e/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001d1rf/""><img border=""0"" width=""500"" height=""480"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0001d1rf/s640x480"" /></a><br /><br />These scrolls took over&nbsp;70 hours to make and I am so proud of them. I know they have flaws. I know I made smudges, that the knotwork is not totally centered, that the top knotwork is not well realized. That the red gouache however lovely would probably be hard to realize in red lead. That the gold fill on the carpet page is not thick enough and the brush strokes are visible. That I used modern materials and tools. But the spirit is undeniably fierce, ancient,&nbsp;and full of love for our&nbsp;friends.</span><br />"

"event","<em>I will keep Gunther's Court Barony&nbsp;scroll (The Scrolls TM) for a separate post. <br /></em><br />We have been looking forward to Trilliums for months, probably since March. Long wet spring and I was dying to get outdoors and play with my friends. <br /><br />From the trial run at Murder Melee it was clear we needed more car capacity to do Trilliums properly. So we bought a roof bag ($24.95, 50% off sale at Canadian Tire!) for the van. It allowed us to stow all the soft bulky stuff aloft and have more room for groceries inside. Yay! When full it was still relatively light compared to the futon mattress we also brought. The only hassle (after getting the straps to the right length) was forgetting just how hot a car roof can get after sitting in the sun for several hours. Owww. <br /><br />As we like to eat well when camping, in advance I marinated chicken souvlaki, mixed home-made hamburgers, found a great deal on striploin steaks, and froze everything solid. Froze a bunch of water. Froze the bacon and sausages. Froze the apple juice. Forgot to freeze the milk but it stayed cold enough anyway. Happily remembered not to freeze the Coke ;-) <br /><br />I booked 2 days vacation and last Wednesday around 5:30 pm we took off for the wilds of Whitby. <br /><br />We stopped in Ajax for McDonald's before continuing to the campsite as I knew we wouldn't have the daylight or energy to cook a dinner after setting up the tent and shade fly. <br /><br />To mutual&nbsp;dismay, at 8:00 pm while&nbsp;driving down the single gravel lane towards Troll, we started hearing a nasty banging noise behind the van. I was terrified that it was the muffler but apparently some unknown bracket decided to lose a bolt and swung down. Albrecht tucked it back up there somehow while I was signing us into the event, and it's been fine since. Still don't know what it's for as I haven't been able to visually acquire it. I need to get over a pit at Jiffy Lube and have them tell me whether I need expensive work or not. <br /><br />I&nbsp;bought Albrecht his annual Trillium War t-shirt, which he always wears on the trip home. We found space not far from Eoforwic. Got the tent&nbsp;up fairly quickly but due to Dark had to leave the shade fly and kitchen set-up for the next day.<br /><br />Thursday morning we got the shade fly and&nbsp;kitchen together and I&nbsp;cooked bacon for brunch. That afternoon I spent 4 hours in the picnic shelter working on The Scrolls TM, then returned&nbsp;and cooked the chicken souvlaki and Greek potatoes, served with tzatziki. Everything was good. For the potatoes I peeled and cut them into thirds the long way, then put them in a pot with water, some oil, grated lemon peel, salt, pepper and some fenugreek seeds, and boiled them until tender. Yum. We had so much food that I sent Albrecht to &quot;Feed the Troll&quot; where Nicolaa and Gunther were working. At one point Rufus straggled by with the kids. He looked wiped. So we fed him and the kids. <br /><br />That night Albrecht participated in the Warlord tourney, where he was chosen Captain of the English side. This pleased him very much and he happily bribed mercenaries to his side with Jos Louis cakes and other comestibles. <br /><br />Friday at 11 I taught a class on Silk and Pattern Familiarization and it went well. I had about 5 attendees. I think I'll write it all up into an article as it's an interesting subject with lots of great eye candy.&nbsp; Dubhessa and Niall arrived on site and set up their tent next to us and she was able to show me all the work she'd done on her new Roman ensemble in dark purple silk noil and blue saree silk with great jewellery FTW. Especially liked the narrow belt she made out of the saree border, hung with large glass beads.<br /><br />Albrecht fought the rapier Bridge Battle and once he got back I went back to the A&amp;S pavilion and worked on The Scrolls TM&nbsp;until they were done. <br /><br />Back at the campsite I cooked the home-made burgers and we fed KRM&nbsp;Lars and his lady. <br /><br />Saturday was a busy day. Although my stress went down once The Scrolls TM were safely delivered to Nicolaa (signet on scene), the family had various conflicting tournaments/meetings/kidstuff to satisfy. Thank you Dubhessa for helping watch the kids for an hour so I could attend the Crucible meeting while Albrecht did the Sword and Cloak Tourney! So appreciated. <br /><br />King Textiles from Toronto showed up to merchant and they had lovely stuffs for sale. I couldn't partake due to budget but everyone seemed to be having a great time. <br /><br />Albrecht's Fechtschule tourney garnered about 12 fencers which was great. Apparently a Fechtschule is the only known documentable-to-SCA-period fencing tournament format. <br /><br />As Court was moved to 7 pm we had time to cook our steaks for dinner. I was feeling stressed again and couldn't eat, so we kept some meat back for the next day.<br /><br />Albrecht changed in to Persian (the red silk caftan I hand made about 10 years ago with the&nbsp;golden silk buttons with seed pearls and bullion thread) and I wore my hand made rose-orange brocade transitional Gothic dress with the black velvet heart-shaped hat. We were&nbsp;strapped for time&nbsp;and I&nbsp;swear I broke the world&nbsp;record in&nbsp;fast&nbsp;turban wrapping.&nbsp;Now he calls me the Turbanator. ha ha ha<br /><br />He looks so good in his Persian that I think I want to make him a long turban wrap in a metallic silk brocade. Maybe orange or a lime green.<br /><br />Part of my nerves was because I&nbsp;had intel that Albrecht would be getting his Maiden's Heart for service. I even&nbsp;remembered to bring my camera. He received a lovely scroll contibuted&nbsp;by Liadin, Nicolaa and Aelfwyn! So well deserved. <br /><br />I also was very much looking forward to seeing Gunther get his Court Barony and to see how The Scrolls TM - especially the wording&nbsp;- turned out. <br /><br />The joke was on me, though, as I too was called into Court to receive an Augmentation of Arms! Apparently these are &quot;exceedingly rare&quot;! Mine is a Scribal Augmentation. The symbol of this particular Augmentation is a very cool Wolf holding an ostrich plume that I get to place on my coat of arms in one corner (either a canton, roundel or escutcheon, I believe). I guess I need to finalize and register my device now! :-) <br /><br />I was really surprised and&nbsp;trying not to cry. Can hardly remember a thing the Queen said.<br /><br />Thank you Liadin and Nicolaa&nbsp;for putting together my scroll! Thank you Matthew for taking&nbsp;pictures of me in court! <br /><br />Then they put Prince Quiliam on vigil for Knighthood with stealthy finesse. Extremely cool. As soon as Duke Sir Berus cried Hold! I knew what was up.<br /><br />After Court we giddily headed back to the campsite, shucked off the hot court garb in exchange for linen and started to have fun. <br /><br />Dubhessa and I went on a jaunt to find TES Septentria as I had a song to perform for them. Couldn't find them anywhere. Asked TE Rising Waters Richard Larmer if he knew where they were. I couldn't believe it. He came out of his comfortable campsite, linked arms with us and took us on a leisurely tour of the campground, singing songs and exchanging courtly pleasantries until we found them. I was so touched. That has never happened to me before in the SCA. Thank you Your Excellency. <br /><br />I performed the song, which is a filk to the tune of Annie Lennox's &quot;Into The West&quot; from LOTR's Return of the King. Earlier in Court TES Septentria had formally announced they would be stepping down next April. Here is my wording: <br /><br />Hear now <br />From the people that you led <br />They acknowledge <br />All the promises you said <br />Step down <br />And stand with the ones who came before <br />Faith and calling <br />You fulfilled all this - and more <br /><br />Septentria weeps <br />To see you departing from this place <br />Septentria bleeds <br />Courageous hearts are laid to waste <br />We proudly bore arms <br />For your safe-keeping <br /><br />From the high seats <br />Percival rises <br />You answered duty's call <br />From the high seats <br />Christiana rises <br />Your joyful heart has made us your own <br /><br />The praise you've earned <br />The lifted glass <br />A bear on the mountain <br />The radiant past <br />With which we are blessed <br /><br />They've asked me to use the text as the first page of their Booke of memories that I've agreed to put together for them. I'll be collecting the words of the people over the next several months for this Booke. <br /><br />Later on we relaxed in the humidity and had a nice cold drink while the mosquitoes bit us silly. Enjoyed the lightshow around 11 pm, received some intermittent rain until 2 am but it wasn't too bad and the tent was dry when we packed up. <br /><br />Sunday morning I woke up early, put the campsite to rights, washed dishes and cooked the rest of the steaks and all of the eggs. That, plus tomatoes and buttered bread, made a heck of a breakfast. We also fed Master Hector and his family as a good steak is a terrible thing to waste.<br /><br />Then we packed carefully trying not to make a mess of things. I&nbsp;had hoped to be done by 2 pm but it was slower than we expected due to the heat so it was closer to 3 pm by the time we hit the road (stopping almost immediately to have a late fast food lunch).<br /><br />My personal goal was to not have to leave the site even once during the four days. Thanks to our new friends Roswyn from Starleaf Gate and Niall from der Welfengau this wish came true. Thank you for the timely offers of ice and milk! <br /><br />Matthew got to throw axes in the glowstick tourney Friday night (with some success! :-) and on Saturday he enjoyed the water fight and the pinata scramble. <br /><br />After Elizabeth got over her Treehouse addiction, she very happily played around the campsite. I had brought a big green basin for washing dishes and she loved splashing in the water and pretending to wash dishes during the hot days. <br /><br />I was glad to get back and have a hot bath. This was the best Trilliums we've enjoyed in a long time. Already planning more evilness for the coming months."

"event","Heh. On Monday I returned from Easter travels to a scroll assignment for Coronation. As usual being crazy and short of time I decided to try and use mostly-authentic materials just to pile on the challenges. So I used a piece of goatskin parchment and oakgall ink from the goodies that Nicolaa brought back from Pennsic for me last year. And gold leaf from the stash I bought in 2003 for $29.95. Considering the rise in commodity prices, that stupid little book of gold leaf is probably worth close to $100! Weird.

I've used parchment before a few times but normally prefer the greasy side. This time I used the dry side. What a mistake. This particular hide had far too much tooth and my oakgall ink bled freely, completely blurring my letters. Also the dip pen caught and stuck all the time.

And for some reason the Guild of Limners oakgall ink stayed a light to medium brown. Not even remotely what I would call black. Don't know why.

Anyway. For the design I decided to adapt an element from the Sollested horse collar (Denmark, 10th century). I've used the dragon terminals before but this time I used the topper instead. It's got a bit of the Jellinge vibe.

It's got a couple of intertwined beasties with nice fangs. I drew it with pencil initially, then inked it in with the oakgall ink.

I have NEVER used gold leaf before, unless you count sticking a tiny piece onto one proto scroll back in 2003 with little more than glue stick.

I picked out a couple of writhing limbs that seemed best suited for highlighting with gold leaf. I gooped some acrylic gesso into a seashell and watered it down to the consistency of thick cream. Then I painted the stuff on in a couple of coats with drying intervals. Went back and built up some areas a little more. Of course, after I had done that I went back and read some gesso sottile recipes and apparently the acrylic gesso is only a starting point and not really a recommended one even as a base. Sugar is involved, for example.

The parchment cutting, pricking the points, design and gessoing took up Monday. Tuesday night was our anniversary so we were out. Wednesday night I didn't do anything much other than email and blowing up Zuma. Thursday night was groceries, karate, banking and other busy stuff. So you bet your sweet patootie I had to do the rest on Friday night after work.

Friday after dinner I sat down and drafted the text for the scroll.

Then I worked on the gold leaf. I drizzled a little honey into a plastic cup, then watered it down a little. I painted that on the gesso patches as my attempts to make them sticky with warm breath through a straw were not working. Aurelia had recommended I drop a bit of high proof alcohol on those areas to reactivate the gesso but I couldn't find my tiny promo bottle of Smirnoff Vodka and I was pretty sure there wasn't much to activate anyway.

Then I used an exacto knife to indirectly cut the gold leaf through the orange paper layer above. Then I rubbed a q-tip through my hair, glided it across the end of the mostly cut piece, and was able to attract it on so I could lay it onto the slightly tacky gesso. This technique worked pretty well and I was able to lay all the gold fairly quickly. Towards the end I was able to lay the pieces almost clean, which is not easy given how it wrinkles at the least provocation.

I didn't bother with a leather cushion as I was taking the gold directly from the book, cutting through the orange paper layer to separate the pieces I wanted. In the end I used about two full leaves. This covered each section about twice. I also used the straw to blow up the loose edges of the leaf so it would double over onto itself and help avoid some of the waste bits.

I don't have glassine parchment to use as a layer for burnishing. I do have some crappy pretend parchment that is fairly stiff and see-through so I figured it would do. I cut a small piece of that and used that to safely press down the leaf as I laid it.

I didn't have a proper burnisher or muller. Initially I tried using smooth quartz pebble over the see-through stuff but didn't like it, so then I got out a little funky metal spoon, used the bowl and that seemed to work better. I don't know whether you're supposed to burnish in little circles or back-and-forth strokes. I tried a little of everything, various pressures and I guess the best way was little circles, with tempo but not too hard. That makes sense I guess. No vulgar comments people.

Now I didn't have a proper brush either. I used a moulting unused make-up brush which I don't recommend as it was not really soft enough and it roughened the gold rather than cleaning up the loose bits. I did try to save all the little bits but my table has glints on it here and there.

Some little corners came up a bit bare. I tried to fix those but screwed up, especially on the top portion, full of right angles, where my little honey experiment ended up smearing when I couldn't remember my own design. I was also using a metal tool to try and scrape away the excess adhering bits of gold and the tool itself left residue on the parchment. Not the win there.

The gold definitely does not have a mirror finish but I was able to bring up some real shine. And it looked OK in Court.

Not having time nor the proper setup to use the red lead (also a Pennsic goodie) I settled for modern red gouache for part of the design. And I hauled out my India Ink to refresh the outlines and fill in part of the design as I was really disappointed with the oak gall ink's lack of depth.

I did the calligraphy last as I wasn't sure how the gold leafing would work. Was not happy at all with the pen catching and the bleeding, as previously mentioned.

And another thing - the parchment really seemed to pick up ambient dirt from my hands so I guess I will need to buy cotton gloves for future projects (any ideas? I don't know where to buy such gloves).

However I think you can tell it is gold leaf.

The scroll has personality and strength even if the execution is comparatively crappy. But with only 12 hours work I think it will do.

So next time it's back to the greasy side of the parchment.

Here are some pictures:

So dear Lady Avelyn of the Hedge, fellow scribe, enjoy. It's a messy scroll, but at least the ingredients are good."

"event","Arrrgh. I have to stop taking vacation days, I work crazy hard before and after and then I work so hard on personal stuff on my vacation that going back to work is almost a relief. At least for the first 45 minutes until the email storm really catches fire.

Had a terrible dream last night. Dreamed that my husband's best friend spent an entire visit telling him all the different games he would no longer play, rather than actually playing a game with him. Then his wife showed me her completed projects that were very similar to ones I have only half-started, which made me feel really great not. Felt totally fat as well. She stepped out of the room and I managed to carelessly knock over a whole bunch of her paperwork including a half-completed piece of art.

After that misery I then got to meet the Math Zone Killer, some kind of imaginary psychopath who kisses like the Headless Horseman, if you catch my drift. He even had a catchy theme song, to the tune of Grapefruit Diet by Weird Al Yankovic.

Woke up at 5:30 am, sweating and heart racing. My dreams are always weird and way too detailed. After a suitable interval I hightailed it to work which grinned at me with too many teeth.

However I got nice flowers and cheesecake for Secretaries Day! I had completely forgotten.

I've had Coke and fudge sauce and I think I might understand why Albrecht, a Coke and chocolate fiend, is always low-key happy. Maybe I should take up his vices instead. But I really prefer meaty salty stuff to sweet stuff.

I'm working on a new scroll for Coronation Saturday. It's on goatskin parchment, using oakgall ink, gold leaf and probably gouache. I don't think I am up to using the red lead right now.

I am not impressed with the oakgall ink so far. It is a light brown that doesn't darken much with time. Guild of Limners, so I'm not sure what's wrong.

Design is based on an element from the Sollested Denmark horse collar. I used some acrylic gesso to build up the design. Hoping to lay down the gold leaf maybe tonight or tomorrow if I chicken out of karate (karate is not going well, and I am too busy to waste time dreading something that I pay for). First gold leaf project. Let's hope it doesn't suck.

I just proved I am a true geek. I recognized Bladerunner on tv just from the sound of the computer zooming in. Haven't watched that movie in years.

Yesterday was our 14th wedding anniversary. I was so busy I couldn't get Albrecht a card or anything. I want to buy him a special sword for cut and thrust but we were told to hold on as someone may have a deal. So I had no presents for him yet and felt sad.

We did manage to go out for dinner at Diana Downtown. He had steak. It was good, although the obligatory pat of tarragon butter was too big (what is it with all the restaurants? They all make the pats way too big and thick!!!) I appreciate the nod to French cuisine but get it right, guys.

I had salmon. The salmon was dry, inadequate sauce, exactly one and a half soggy bland capers. too much blah rice. The calamari appetizer seemed to have come from the deep freeze, though the sauces were good. And not even one little battered spider squid. Allen's on the Danforth has the best calamari. I miss Allen's. We have to go there soon.

I used to love Diana Downtown but next time we're going to Milestones.

Once we got home we had homemade fudge sauce, courtesy of Matthew, with expensive vanilla ice cream and canned whipped cream. I have a whole bunch of real whipping cream and egg whites and sour cherry jam that I am holding back for a big Pavlova. I was supposed to make it for Easter but we ended up out of town so it has to wait until next Sunday.

We had a family funeral on Saturday in Nepean. A comparatively sudden thing for a beloved man. My flowers were barely 2 days old before he died in hospital. I don't know whether he even had time to comprehend the riddikulus fax I sent (he didn't have a phone) before he receded into sedation.

We did the 5 hours to Gananoque Good Friday, then 2 hours to Nepean, the funeral, 2 hours back, then 5 hours back to Guelph on Sunday. I roasted chickens on Saturday after the funeral for dinner.

Maman wore grey with a lovely new lilac scarf and I wore dark purple and black, with quiet silver and amethyst jewellery. Victorian mourning colours. We idly wondered whether anyone would notice the cues.

The best thing though was Albrecht and I were able to escape for 90 minutes to walk around Gan while Maman watched the children. We actually had a quiet pint together. I put my hand on his knee and flirted outrageously. After the drinks we wobbled into the second hand book store and I bought two books, one on antique maps (pending project) and one on the Rijksmuseum with some very cool pictures I hadn't seen before. By then we were feeling a bit more awake and trundled back over the footbridge on the Gan River (MY the water was exciting! Lots of spring runoff!) and back to the house to finish cooking dinner.

I'd had enough presence of mind to pack along all the Easter goodies and was able to present the family on Sunday morning with pretty Easter baskets full of Peeps, solid chocolate bunnies and foil-covered chocolate eggs. Alas, I could not find any decent sized chocolate marshmallow eggs. Didn't have time to visit the Nutty Chocolatier, I bet they would have had them."

"event","Over many years I nurtured hopes, essentially, that the universe was sentient and would recognize me. That there are worlds of goodness beyond and above me who would reach out to me and help me climb up to them.

I had always held before me the ideal of true communication between individuals. I wanted to participate in this.

Before, for some years I conducted the experiment that the courage to expose feelings and thoughts in rawness and honesty would encourage and enable others to share theirs in turn. And I thought that people did desire to share their dreams and hurts but lacked opportunities to do so. I dared.

Yet the opposite of what I hoped for happened. I was judged, and the people I spoke to clammed up even more. I lost their respect. The friendships eroded.

I slowly, belatedly learned to shut up, though I still screw up. Working on gradually crushing the desire to reach out and any expectation that someone else will.

I can see the retreat, the dismissal in their eyes when I step just a little outside, just a little naked. Asking me to stop.

For years, I hoped to look into your eyes and see some of the fears and hopes that I feel. I hoped you would speak them to me and grace me with your trust. And that this trust would somehow elevate both of us, create something new between us and maybe something new in the world.

Not cool. That's me.

Not cool for wanting to really communicate. Not cool for thinking love should not be restricted to one's blood family. Not cool for being loyal. For acknowledging, and thus honouring, loss. For asking for help.

I kept thinking there would be more or greater mysteries I could break into or rise towards. Of greater communities. That spirits never fully leave. That God or gods would communicate, if asked earnestly and long enough."

"event","Saturday I was awoken at 0630 by my daughter who was sitting howling at the top of the stairs. She didn't want to come sit on our bed. I took her downstairs, turned on the t.v. and got her a drink of milk.

More whining, and I blearily realized that she had spit up some milk on her front. More followed. Basically spent the whole day trying to get her to keep some water or apple juice down and cleaning up the negative results. Went through several outfits and blankets. Need to steam-clean the carpet again.

Meanwhile I was letting husband sleep in. He had been sick with a bad chest cold most of the week and got little sleep due to the same child's night terrors this week.

Around 10:00 am I toasted Eggos for husband and son, decorated them with syrup and canned whipped cream and brought husband's upstairs so he could have breakfast in bed.

Then I judged one of the Ice Dragon Pent papers. Need to judge the others today or I'll be SOL.

Did 45 min stationary cycling while reading Nero Wolfe.

Heated up leftover butter chicken and rice for the non-barfing family members for lunch.

Washed dishes part of the afternoon.

Read more Nero Wolfe.

Admired son's miniature painting. One miniature had excellent control, the other was blobby. But he's getting there, especially with his colours.

Cooked bacon and made BLTs for people for dinner.

Did some office emails and calls.

Meanwhile small daughter couldn't keep any liquids down. She alternately whined, barfed and napped all day. I spent a lot of time just watching her sleep, periodically checking her breathing. Eventually gave her some pseudo-Gravol. Didn't stay down. Tried some more later that evening that did stick.

Escaped from Treehouse long enough to watch the Leafs win. Played far too much Zuma Blitz. You know you've OD'd on computer games when you can see them with your eyes shut.

Crawled up to bed at 11 pm, leaving daughter with husband to watch. Came to around 9 am (should have been 8 am but thank you Daylight Savings NOT!) and forced myself to come back downstairs where husband and daughter were waking up, to get the latest report.

She did manage to sleep for 6 hours last night without barfing again. Unfortunately today hasn't been much of an improvement yet. I was hopeful but she couldn't keep down her milk again, so it's back to watered apple juice. More barfing and whining, but less fraught.

So we have decided to make today a Kung Fu movie day. Started off with Kung Fu Panda, have segued to Kung Fu Hustle, will probably watch Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Big Trouble in Little China and anything else on the shelf that vaguely fits the bill.

I will also make a beef pot roast later today. Maybe I'll make a pie. Table is covered with husband and son's miniature paints. I don't dare take out any sewing right now.

Want to make myself a Japanese outfit. I have some nice fabrics, including a dove grey brocade that, although the pattern is not perfect, might work as an outer layer.

I hope she throws off the bug today."

Here is my latest scroll. The recipient is Lars Eriksson, an excellent fencer and the new Kingdom Rapier Marshal, who received his Thorbjorn's Hammer yesterday at St. Valentine's Day Massacre II.

I had an idea to use one of the carved animal head bedposts found in the Oseberg mound. The carved heads are all different, done by different hands in order to finish the bed to a deadline.

I, too, had a deadline so I picked the post that was only decorated on the head itself with a smooth plain post. The base of the post itself is decorated, but I replaced that with the badge of the Order.

Here's a link to one picture of the post. See Plate II.
http://www.colonialfurniture.us/history/history-colonial-furniture-2.htm

The beast appears to be a snarling or barking dog with his ears laid back. The knotwork could be construed as an elaborate harness. So basically the bed is like a sledge drawn by four dogs. I don't know if there is a Norse god or goddess who used dogsleds as transportation but I think it's wonderful to be transported to sleep, protected by four loyal and beloved, richly ornamented dogs.

I slightly simplified the knotwork harness. The voids in the original beast head appear black, and as I was using gold as the main colour, the black ink voids give a sophisticated look to the overall design.

Here are a couple of pictures.

"event","Yesterday was Ealdormere's Kingdom Arts & Sciences Fair and Competition. We attended en famille, driving cautiously through intense fog in Guelph and Burlington. Arrived safely, only forgetting one minor thing from our caravanserai.

Nice little site, backup washrooms, and stairs and hallways to keep our kids happy and playing more or less out of the way.

Albrecht was to judge HE Giovanni's Grosse Messer entry, which won its category (yay!) and I had a full day of judging lined up, 13 entries plus the Pent judging. As a previous Ealdormere Pent champion (2003) I have judged Pent every year since but one. We ended up with 5 Pent entrants yesterday and saw some wonderful unusual things.

I enjoyed the citrus comfits, a neat leather ball based on a York find, Scoggers (a kind of knitted arm-warmer, cue the (15) '80s music ;-), Menken's well presented suite of entries based on the Noble Parsnip (yay Armoured (Mac and Cheese) Parsnips Casserole!), and a lovely red and gold silk late period gown (created for HE Skraeling Althing) from a promising set of entries by Sarah Greenhill.

Lady Lucrece de Montsoreau won Pent with some excellent, well-researched items including her late 15th century transitional Gothic gown in mustard yellow wool, henin and lappet hood ensemble, leather bottle, mulled wine and I've temporarily forgotten the fifth entry. She presented very well and it was a pleasure to see her field everyone's questions.

I was glad to see the Spanish ensemble by Baroness Rosalina de la Fuentes win its category. She had put a huge amount of work into a demanding and complex project and produced lovely results.

I also caught up briefly with Lassarfhina and glommed over her Lindisfarne-inspired scroll painted with period pigments, tres cool. I need to find time to play with the pretty pigments that Nicolaa obtained for me at Pennsic this year as I have evil scribal plans still to put into play.

Kingdom A&S Minister Mistress Keja actually took the trouble to give all the judges personalized thank-you notes, which I've never seen before. Another thing I liked was the pre-judging huddle and reading of the riot act, to wit, Thou Shalt Not Be A Jerk.

Judging can be tough for entrants and judges alike and the aim is to give helpful feedback and large doses of enthusiasm and encouragement. It's supposed to be fun and exciting to enter, and I hope that the quality of judging we saw yesterday left folks with greater comfort and confidence to enter more, enter often and tell their friends. I would like to see more local A&S competitions/tourneys to give folks more low-key opportunities to enter pieces and get used to the feedback process and what judges are looking for.

Thank you to whomever opened the windows or otherwise ventilated the room. It got hot very quickly when the event began, and I felt much better to meet the first clean cool breeze.

I was happy to more-or-less finish my latest Gothic gown for this event. It's a rose-gold patterned synthetic brocade that I lined with a matching orangey linen-cotton blend. Both fabrics are from Fabricland and less than $5/metre (sale). I managed to cut and sew the sleeves Friday and actually got to bed before 2 am. I didn't have time to complete the golden beading on the turned neckline and will finish that another day.

I wore a wide silk belt with the dress but it tends to buckle over the course of the day so I'll just go back to my leather belt. I had planned to wear my black velvet heart-shaped headdress but my hair was not behaving in its snood so I gave up and threw a piece of linen gauze on top instead, which was OK.

Also yesterday one of my pending scrolls was given out - a Crucible to Patrov Roelfsson! He was very happy and surprised and he and his lady seemed very happy with the scroll. The scroll was created for Fall Coronation but he couldn't attend so the award was put on hold until he could be caught.

THL Patrov is a woodworker, leatherworker and many other things in the technological sciences sphere, and is into Norse culture. When planning the scroll, I originally committed to one idea, but 12 hours before the scroll was due I changed my mind and started from scratch with a new idea using a design from a carved bedpost in the 9th centry Oseberg ship burial.

For the scroll, I did two illuminated sections using the design of the carving, and inverted the right-hand side instead of making it a mirror image as I thought it would look cool and extend the zoomorph feeling.

I'm not happy with the award badge for two reasons. 1, it's too big in relation to the Oseberg motif, and 2, I had a b!tch of a time with the angles of the 7-pointed star. I always like to figure it out myself and didn't do so well this time.

The reason the star badge of the Order is too big is that I realized almost too late that I was missing some of the rings. My own Crucible scroll has an earlier version of the device. I only realized when I was pulling the blazon off the net for my text (also written on the last night) - when the main part of the badge was already painted. So I yanked out my compass and brushes again and painted in the rings, weaving the design in with the Oseberg motif where they met.

I did the wording in Elder Futhark runes. Here is the text:

***
An avid woodworker
And maker of beautiful boxes and chairs
A longstanding teacher
And creator of skilled leather works,
Pewter castings and fine etchings in brass

For the excellence of Patrov Roelfsson
In woodworking and Norse material culture,
We, King Quilliam, in glory forever green,
And Queen Dagmar, conscientious and true
Induct Patrov Roelfsson into
Our noble Order of the Crucible

He has the right to wear the badge of the order:
Gules, a mullet of seven points voided and interlaced
And a double tressure Or
We also give unto him a Grant of Arms
And the right to bear his arms
With the Crest of the Kingdom.

Done at Our final court this 25th day of September
Anno Societatis 45
At Coronation in Our Canton of Petrea Thule

***
When the herald came to the line, ""We, King Quilliam, in glory forever green,"" there were some giggles as of course we've had a reign change since then. The Count glanced at me and I grinned.

Here are some pictures. The scroll was still damp, so I had my husband hold it up for me to take pictures rather than place it on the scanner bed.

"event","Lately I have been working on some clothes for Albrecht and I, hopefully to be complete for Coronation.

I've had a 1560s early Elizabethan black velvet brocade suit of clothes in process for him for at least two years, but have barely touched it for a long time due to other priorities.

The doublet is mostly complete except for sleeves, buttons, buttonholes and lacing holes. I put skirting on it recently but may take it off and rethink as it seems too long and lacks oomph.

Last week I started serious work on the trunkhose/poofy pants. Have sewn many black velvet panes interlined with coarse canvas, made a base of green linen (note to self: make them much more form fitting next time, they're a bit baggy inside), made a gathered interlining of cream silk dupioni (the puffy stuff that sticks out between the black panes) and have mostly assembled the right hand side. Really as a trial so I can see what works and what doesn't.

It's not too bad.

Here's a view of the silk being gathered to a strip of narrow green ribbon:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000xgkd/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000xgkd/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Here's a picture of the panes on the silk:
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000sdq8/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000sdq8/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Here's a view of the leg:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ta5w/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ta5w/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Lessons learned: the Elizabethans made the formfitting base out of chamois leather as they stand clear of all the poofyiness and it makes it a lot easier to get into them. Don't sew down panes until you know how they look when the person is wearing the pants. Make the pants shorter rather than longer for maximum pumpkin effect. And buy a lot of loud gold trim next time.

After I got that leg done I needed a mental break, so I turned to a new Gothic dress I am making. I cut the pinky-gold brocade as part of my class at Trilliums this July, now I'm assembling it. This material was $4 or $5/metre at my friendly neighbourhood Fabricland (which rocks more than any other Fabricland I've ever found).

As the brocade is not hefty enough to fall right, I am backing it with some peach shot linen blend that I got from Fabricland for $3/metre when they were liquidating the Linwood fabrics last summer.

Here's an early shot of the principal seam work (from the inside):

I'm also starting work on a new scroll - need to find appropriate inspiration.

Also I'm almost late for a family bbq event so need to get back on track in the next 45 minutes."

Congratulations to my gallant husband for his victorious quest to become a Provost in the Ealdormere Academy of Defense at this long weekend's War of the Trillium in Whitby, ON.

Happy moments from the War:

Hearing a loud cheer come up from the rapier list, and finding out it was because my husband had won the required number of bouts and could begin the endurance round.

Playing Magdalena for him after the tournament by washing his tired legs with jasmine soap while his feet rested in a basin of cool water.

Serving perfectly cooked, medium rare ribeye steaks for our celebration dinner and having one left over to share with friends. Folks were walking up to Court as I dished up, and one Lord said, ""Now that's MEAT"". I rushed to cut him a nice hunk to take along. It was that good.

Not having to leave site once over the four days, thanks to Medb and Nicolaa bringing us an 18-pack of Classic Coke and a bag of ice on Saturday. That saved our butts guys, thank you so much.

Having scribal time with Liadin and enjoying the new Terraskin paper. Also hearing her funny motorcycle story about the consequences of Falling Behind The Power Curve.

Finishing the calligraphy on my two scrolls before the light died Friday night, and getting them photographed and safely under cover before the dew could fall.

Cool nights that made for excellent sleeping on our new 8"" futon mattress.

Seeing Liadin's husand Aodhan startle when his name was called to join the Order of Thorbjorn's Hammer.

Finishing the packing Sunday afternoon and finding there were exactly 2 cold Cokes left for us to drink on the way home.

Here are two photos of my latest scrolls for Trillium Wars:

AOA for Mjoll Ulfsdottir

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000kt4d/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000kt4d/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

The golden birds, intended to represent Hugnin and Mugnin, are based on a gold or brass plaque from the Viking era.

Order of the Thorbjorn's Hammer for Aodan Longarrow

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000pz4y/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000pz4y/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

The lefthand motif is based on an Ostrogothic bow brooch, mid 6th century, from Wittislingen. As Aodhan is receiving his award for his mondo skills in archery, I thought that would be a cool, not too obvious design. Everyone keeps saying Wow, Aztec, but really it's an entirely different continent.

We got back home around 4 pm and the unloading began. Then groceries, snacking and finally hot baths for us and our incredible collection of bug bites. I am tired. Bring on the pillow, time for a smackdown."

"event","As in a Tudor convertible :-)

I'm making myself a reversible Missy Elliott Tudor dress (""put my thang down, flip it and reverse it"") in my hot new red shantung silk, with the reverse in greeny-gold brocade. It's going to be snifty.

I have to go make dinner now but here's a picture of the inaugural stitches. It's hard to tell the scale, but here's the math: 10-12 stitches per inch, in golden thread. I'm using polyester thread on the skirt body, but will use matching gold silk thread on the bodice.

The green doesn't show up too well in the shot but trust me, it looks go-od.

I am so happy to be sewing on silk again.

"event","Every evening for a week I have been working on a Book of Durrow inspired scroll for an AOA recipient with a Hiberno-Norse persona. 

I had hoped to make it a fairly close reproduction but as the week wore on I came to realize it would probably take 3 weeks of evenings to do properly.

The original cross-carpet page consists of interwoven gripping horse motifs in red and deep yellow on a black ground with white and cream green accents. The incipit page was somewhat simpler, consisting of braided knotwork initial work and the same hierarchy of initials later seen in the Lindisfarne Gospels (dominating primary initial and 3 other sizes in diminuendo).

Here is a link to the cross-carpet page:
http://mattstone.blogs.com/photos/christian_art_celtic/book-of-durrow.gif

Here is a link to the incipit page:
http://www.biocrawler.com/w/images/f/f3/BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg

I made a pretty good stab at the horses on the four horizontal rows. Unfortunately my vertical columns were the wrong size (too thick), which forced too much torque on the figures. In the end, out of time, I decided to erase my pencil work and leave the two small sections blank. I did briefly consider making them Royal signature zones but it didn't make sense for the rest of the art.

While the original used a deep yellow, now flaking, I decided to use my gold gouache for that component. Here is a picture of the gold being laid in:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ds4h/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ds4h/s320x240"" width=""180"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Here is a close-up of the gold work:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ekr8/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000ekr8/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

As I have said before, knotwork is basically taking a sine wave and putting a kink in it. The Durrow pages show exactly that. In fact, the incipit page I adapted (very sketchily, I might add) shows that concept in its simplest form as little tendrils beside the primary lines.

So it's important to carefully plot out how the waves intersect and I did a fair bit of measuring as I went along. Too bad I didn't mark out the text lines before I started painting, as the incipit page looks slanted to the right compared to the cross-carpet page on the left. Due to the time required for the cross-carpet page I did the incipit page on Friday night and finished just before 1 am.

Once I was finished sketching I traced over the designs with my brown micropen. Black tends to look too coarse, but the brown works.

I loved laying in the gold, dark red (two gouaches mixed together to produce a strong opaque red) and black ink. I used a triple zero Kalinsky sable brush for all of the work. Most of it is very clean but I was tired on Friday so some of the black work runs into the gold a little.

I had hoped to trace the white interlacing of the horses' limbs (with the alternate haunches in cream green, as per the original) but did not have the time.

I also snatched up the wrong nib so the calligraphy is thicker than I had wanted. Frankly, the incipit page is nowhere near as nice as the carpet page but at least it doesn't compete too much. I did manage to give it the Coptic red dots treatment though.

Here is a picture of the finished scroll:

"event","Yesterday Devin and I went to Value Village and Fabricland to buy fabric. 

At Value Village  Devin found a nice oatmeal linen blend curtain to cut up for a Roman shift and a few other nice pieces. She also picked up a great book on Roman Art, as Roman is her costuming thing right now. I collected a lovely warm golden brown wool blanket for a few bucks and arctic fleece Toronto Maple Leafs bedding for Matthew, plus a nice book on Needlepoint by Hope Hanley.

I don't do counted thread embroidery because it is too hard on my eyes but I love the subtle graduated effects one can get, and these books often have lovely old pieces from the 16th and 17th centuries.

Over to Fabricland. They had mixed up their value racks with near-retail pricing so it was a little confusing at first to find where the REAL bargains were. However Devin found a great steely blue shot fabric with a scarlet warp, and I got some deeply discounted linen blend in off-pink cream with a fine beige stripe that was very nice. Then I grabbed 6 yards of a green/gold brocade with little gold motifs. Not too stiff or thick. They also had a 60% off sale on selected items and I finally broke down and got a vivid red silk shantung that I have been eyeing for years.

We toddled off home playing the Spoons and ducking a heavy shower. Back at the apartment I found a big hunk of red ramie that had just never worked into any clothes for the family. I had thought to use it for Japanese trousers for Albrecht, but abandoned that idea when told that scarlet pants is a woman thing. It matched Devin's steel blue shot fabric very nicely. She had also picked up some bright red embroidery floss and some great buttons - a silver metal button with greyhounds and vine scrolls, and some excitingly barbaric gold buttons.

I was considering making a Tudor ensemble with the green/gold brocade and red silk (red as a forepart) but they didn't quite go enough. Then I remembered I still had a bunch of large-pattern black brocade with a raised flocked pattern. Here's a photo of the two fabrics together:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000b5yz/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/asagormsdottir/pic/0000b5yz/s320x240"" width=""304"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

The red shows up as carnation but it's really more like the red of the dinner dress that Mina wears with the Prince in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Bitch red.

Now I need to go to Canadian Tire to pick up some thick zip ties to use as boning and a paint stirrer for a busk :-)

I have a scroll due for Lady Mary, and I decided to do a Book of Durrow adaptation. I'm dividing the scroll into two sections, making it look as if it's an opened book with the carpet page on the left and the incipit page on the right. Insular is first and foremost based on symmetry, which, in the more complicated Lindisfarne and Kells expressions, becomes downright maddening with its compass whorls and tiny interlacing. However, Durrow is a good baby step towards the insanity.

The original has a knotwork mandala in the centre; here, I will leave the centre blank for the Kingdom seal. The original's deep yellow bears a remarkable resemblance to foil gold; I will use gold metallic gouache instead.

Here's a picture of the layout to date. I have just started sketching in the sine wave shapes for the gripping beasts. The incipit page is not yet begun.

"event","Everyone has met that wonderful person with the open eyes and engaging yet confidential smile. In your very first conversation, they treat you like you're extra special and act like there is a treasured secret between you. You can't wait to figure out what it is!

Notice though, that the sparkling conversation is pretty brief and that soon the person moves on to the next new-cherished friend. Meanwhile you stand, a little dazzled and looking forward to talking to that person again because they made you feel so good for the few moments they engaged you.

That's charisma. The star quality that makes politicians. What Pratchett refers to as pixie dust.

The problem is that they don't actually have anything for you except their momentary attention. They remember your name, like a mnemonic tic. Without promising anything they convince you that they care, and they do, for as long as you affect their interests.

Perhaps because I am initially shy and slow to make friends, charisma is more dangerous for me.

I have rushed off, starry-eyed, any number of times to please charismatic people, hoping for more of their glamour. Spent money: spent time and tears. But their hearts are their own; you cannot win them with labour and they are immune to your sincerity.

Beware charisma."

"event","Great stuff at this year's Cloth of Gold. Six entrants, lots of yummy wool, no waiting.

Props to the Ramshaven Finnish team for the awesome job, winning First in Novice. Shiomi is a stitching maniac. Love the spiral brass wire beads the team made. I have seen photos of the extant beads and fabric scraps but never considered actually making them. Totally geeking out over that entry. HRM pointed out the difficult cut of the white undertunic.

Eoforwic did a splendid job again, winning First in Advanced with the Mary of Hapsburg gown recreation. Lovely green silk, well cut skirt. I loved the rose linen bloomers, very sweet. The hat was the icing on the cake.

Other highlights: a pretty Byzantine necklace with pendant pearls, oatmeal linen from the Darc side of the Loom team, the silk Liadin Chu used for her cap, and wee Liam's suit of clothes for his birthday. I remember making Matthew's baby tunic the same way years ago with the gores and rolled up sleeves.

Cloth of Gold is always a pleasure to judge. I autocrated the first Cloth of Gold in 2006 (before that it was Golden Seamstress) and have helped judge the two CoGs since then. Maybe next time I will be in the right Life phase to enter a team.

Did my first foray as deputy on-site signet. Didn't screw up. Thank you Lyda for the grins and confidence! Nicolaa contributed a couple of Lindisfarne-inspired beauties with knotwork cats with large staring eyes. I had a simple scroll with silver gouache wolves gripping a Maiden's Heart and matching jewelled rondels.

Here's a picture of the scroll:

Colder day than expected - almost constant icy flurries that veritably rattled through the branches of the woods around the site.

I witnessed the beginning of Keja's vigil and later her laurelling ceremony. Strongly persona-inspired, interesting and pretty but didn't care for the heavy self-abasement language. I take things very seriously. I did like the swinging censer. They lit it earlier behind a curtain and until the scent really developed I was concerned that the wooden structure had sprung a fire. I'm such a dope.

Got some satisfying work done yesterday on my transitional houppelande in red, black and gold brocade edged with blonde fun fur. Got the rest of the main seam sewn this morning. Later I need to cut and sew the hem, then cut out the hanging sleeves, the false inner sleeves and dickey in contrasting black faux dupioni brocade and finish that baby off, hopefully in time for Coronation.

Ludwig put on a stellar lunch as usual. Best $5 lunch I have had in ages. Fresh corn chowder (never had it before, very good), big chunks of garlic bread, choice of vegetable or meat lasagne, make-your-own caesar salad and big cup of apple or orange juice or choice of pop. Mmmm, Coke Zero saved my life.

Once Court let out I made a beeline for the parking lot and called Albrecht. He had pork chops and fried rice just coming out of the pan. Zoomed home. Ahhhh."

"event","Self-doubt is a hungry monster, and artisans and performers are particularly vulnerable to its avid embrace. At some point (and sometimes semi-perpetually) we will pathetically seek validation from anyone who will listen for five minutes.

Talking is therapy. People need support, especially if their art is a solitary one. But sometimes it seems more worthwhile if one witholds oneself and blocks off the need.

There have been situations where I was competing for attention with other similarly-needy artisans and the true adults in the room indulgently dispensed crumbs of comfort that I cropped up with zeal. But later I felt ashamed. Sweet in my mouth and bitter in my belly.

No one wants to continuously hear or reward twice-told self-aggrandizing tales of semi-virtue.

I taught a new class at Saturday's RUM on 1450s Gothic women's dress. It was mainly a draping class but my introduction was not well thought out. I had deliberately not done handouts as I wanted to try a more extempore approach rather than reading off my notes all the time. The class was full, lots of Laurels and Baronesses I didn't know, and I started to get nervous.

Anyway I struggled through the introduction with my visual aids and rough historical setting, and got on to the draping practical. An older lady offered to hold my pins for me. That little act of warmth and kindness made me feel a lot better, and the draping exercise itself was a success. Folks actually learned something they didn't know, something simple, quick and fun to do that yielded the right silhouette.

Oh yeah, I accidentally misused the word ""gorgeriz"". I believe it refers to the string used to tie up the modesty piece/dickey on the Gothic dress, but instead I stumbled and used it in another context.

I need to work on the class but I'm glad the draping went over well. And I thank Demelza of Gwyntarian for making my day better just by holding my pins."

Both classes I taught went well. Standing room only for the Gothic dress draping class. My Celtic Motif class was also well received. I even taught a 20-minute class on the fly regarding converting a saree to an Italian Renaissance gown.

Didn't really care for the sauerbraten but the parsnips in horseradish cream were excellent, I loved the rye bread with accompanying neuchatel cheese and herbed butter, and the chicken in sour cream and mushroom sauce was also very good.

Milica and Justin rock, as do their four cats Phantom, Spock, Zatharus and ? can't remember right now. Lots of room, comfortable house, and they even laid in supplies with us in mind. Excellent pizza Friday night from Leno's. Great bacon and scrambled egg breakfast today with croissants. We were quite close to the event site which was great. Wonderful conversations every night.

Big wardrobe this trip - Norse for the Ripping Off Celtic Motifs class, my blue silk 1450s Gothic gown for the Gothic dress draping class, and then into my 1495 Venetian peach and copper dresses for the court and feast. Got my picture taken, bought a cool Viking bead from Rivka (dark swirled green with quicksilvery droplets), a heraldic per bend sinister cookie cutter for Albrecht and then a little silver pennanular brooch with amethysts for me. My hosts gave me a container of honey from Justin's beehives (Tekton Apiaries) which Matthew will really enjoy!

Thanks to Medb for navigating and to Medb, Darius and Lynette for the great conversations especially on the way back home.

Very tired, not much sleep last three nights. Slept funny on my hip which is still a little numb. But I have vacation tomorrow and can try to catch up."

A close female relative was hesitant when calling me, assuming I would be traumatized by this birthday. But no. Don't see why I should. Birthdays to me are about being spoiled with presents and chocolate cake and extra consideration. Did I mention the cake?

I'm throwing a party for myself next Sunday so I can feed my friends. Lasagne, shrimp, strawberries and, of course, chocolate cake with buttercream frosting are on the menu, among other things.

In a couple of weeks Medb and I are travelling to the Royal University of the Midrealm near North Canton, Ohio. I'm teaching a class on Gothic dress (including a draping practical) and a class called ""Beyond the Book of Kells: Ripping off Celtic Motifs"", which talks about finding SCA scroll inspiration in Celtic art.

The premise for the Celtic Art class is this: folks look at the Lindisfarne Gospels or Book of Kells, are intimidated by the incredibly intricate illumination, maybe try a bit of knotwork on a scroll and then give up. My class is about deconstructing motifs in the extant illumination sources - and then moving on to other pieces of Celtic art - chiefly metalwork, though stonework is another source - for elements one can re-use in scrolls. I'm talking about the Ardagh Chalice, Tara Brooch, Lismore Crozier, St. Patrick's Bell Shrine and lots of other pieces including Sutton Hoo and the latest Anglo-Saxon hoard.

I deconstruct a specific object and identify a striking, self-contained element, such as a gripping beast or interesting knotwork formation. Then I paint it in gold on the scroll and add decorative elements e.g. representations of millefiori beads or stepwork enamel inlay. I may adapt the beast or shape to suit my heraldic needs (e.g. change a man's head to a wolf, a triskelion to a trillium).

Secondly, I like to layer in the paint so I can create a 3-D effect. Inserting tiny droplets or thin lines of gold gouache at intervals on a flat gold ground gives the impression of repousse very typical of Celtic-era metalwork. With silver it would look very Norse but I prefer gold. Note to self: do some experiments to see if the silver gouache tarnishes or changes colour. As well, layering in the paint on a millefiori bead can really make it stand out. The overall impact is of real gold and jewels.

For my Gothic women's dress class I am focussing on the transition between Houppelande to Burgundian in Northern Europe (15th century). Yes, this means the obligatory silly hats, beautiful belts and rich, heavy fabrics. But I have a draping technique that is easy and not wasteful. I'll be bringing my blue silk dupioni transitional Gothic, a new Houppelande in heavy red brocade that I haven't made yet (note to self: kick self's butt) and a demonstration fabric for the class. I hope I'll have time to make a flower pot hat. I bought bristol board yesterday for my visual aids.

Also I bought a new car. I've been driving an 11-year old Pontiac Transport minivan. It's at 196K km and is getting creaky. I had some major transmission work 9 months ago, which really helped but the gas mileage is going downhill again and I'm worried I'll experience a repeat soon. Also, the electronics are slowly dying. Friday I had trouble lights on the dash that ended up costing me $200 for a wire that shorted out. One has to expect this as a car ages. However, I'm no longer game. So while I was waiting for the technician to do his magic computer trick, I wandered out to the Sales area and glared at an SUV. When an elderly trustworthy-looking gent came up, I told him I prefer minivans, and the dance began.

He showed me a 2005 Montana SV6 that just came in off-lease (when we looked at the manual we found he had actually sold it himself 5 years ago). Only 67K km, but the car is really only 4.25 years old. From my calculations the original owner was driving 30 km to work one way, which is reasonable for this neck of the woods.

Being substantially the same vehicle as the Transport, with some extra bells and whistles, I felt qualified to judge it. After a good look, a decent test drive, proof that the DVD player and wireless headphones worked and two people eyeballing my poor old Transport, we got down to brass tacks and shortly had a deal. I'm getting $600 in trade-in on my old car, which is $100 more than I expected, and $300 more than KIA would give me last fall.

I did a bunch of internet research and this particular vehicle's main issue appears to be the automatic sliding doors. Well, I hate those anyway, and the salesperson showed me upon my request how to turn them to manual, which I immediately did. Just need to make sure the door contacts are clean and have the right kind of goo on them, and I shouldn't have any problems.

I pick it up on Wednesday afternoon, an early birthday present. I am happy about the car, and hope it will perform well on the trip to Ohio. Thing is, I have never personally bought a car before, though I have certainly financed other things (and read many different kinds of contracts). My (used) cars have been gifts from family members. I did a fair bit of research last fall when I was getting worried, but didn't take the plunge. However I believe my dear late dad was passing me car mojo because I didn't feel worried while I was doing all the steps and I'm not (yet) feeling any buyer's remorse.

And at least it's not a Toyota <grin>. Poor Toyota.

And it has WAY better cupholders so my drink won't tip over on the floor like it used to in the old van. I don't remember if it has fog lights though. Must check. No iPod plug-in but I understand for $125 they can pull out the radio, drill a hole, insert the plug-in and reinstall. Maybe later.

Yesterday we went shopping at the Maul for my birthday. I gave the family some reasonably specific parameters, but not so specific that there's no surprise left.

I was out fabric shopping with a friend recently and picked up some $5/metre rusty herringbone wool blend. Very fine weave. Put it through a hot wash/dry cycle last night, not much shrinkage but a lot of fluff in the dryer vent. I was going to make an apron dress of it (there were only 3.25 metres), but may change my mind and do a tunic as it is very wide.

I really love the Guelph Fabricland on Speedvale - it is so clean and well organized and the $3-5/metre racks are large and interesting. I always find nice natural fibres, impressive synthetic brocades and faux silk shantung on sale cheap in those racks. But forget buying dupioni there unless you like paying $30/metre for crap when you can get better for $12-14/metre on Gerrard Street. They did have a sale right after Christmas but I was not able to take them up on it.

Last night I actually went so far as to do some advance cooking - Tijuana Barbecue, which is a pulled pork dish created by James Barber way back in the 70s. I hadn't made it in a long time. You brown a big 'ol pork loin on all sides in oil, high heat, then remove to a dish, turn down the heat and saute (imagine the accent) 2 onions sliced into rings. Add a can of whole tomatoes, cocoa powder, bay leaves, oregano, some garlic cloves, vinegar, cayenne, dried mustard and salt, bring it to the boil, put the pork back in and turn heat down to low and leave it covered for 5-6 hours until the meat falls apart. Very good on tortillas, rice or boiled potatoes tossed in butter, or just by itself in a sodden heap of intense meaty goodness.

Of course, I always up the cocoa and garlic (they're whole cloves, they turn into sweetness not acridity over the long cooking period, no stinkage) and add beer (I prefer Hoegaarden wheat beer) or white wine. Last night it was half a bottle of sake. I also used designer salt from some volcanic island (because it was fun to spill dark red crystals into the bubbling mass). Around 1 am I took it off the stove and put it in the fridge. Today I might put it back on the stove for a couple of hours at low heat just to intensify it.

Feeling mighty creative and smug this weekend."

I did too much driving on the weekend and by the time I got into the apartment Sunday night it was all I could do to be nice and pleasant to my anxious family. I was just so tired after driving through hours of rain and fog on the 401.

Then this morning more rain and fog, 250 emails waiting for me and a vacation day's worth of catch-up on everything else. Catch-up stains just like ketchup.

Came home tonight in drizzle that began to freeze the last 15 minutes of the drive. Traction was going fast - spun my tires at two standing starts and by the time I got home the ground was a pebble-y ice rink.

Additionally annoying is my inability to stay on a diet once I get home for dinner. Everyone else is eating their normal serving and I'm glomming everything in sight. All the arguments make logical sense but I can't make them stick. I'm trying to be upbeat and happy but it's not working right now.

X-Box fairy smote twice yesterday and Albrecht is in heaven with the latest Halo game.

"event","For the Kingdom Arts and Sciences event a couple of weeks ago I was asked to create early period Award of Orion scrolls for a husband and wife. I didn't know them well but some Googling helped flesh out the wording. The husband was interested in forging, leatherwork, armouring etc. while the wife especially enjoys weaving, helping with feasts, the art of tea and soothsaying. So I did a very simple rhyming quatrain for the wife and a triplet for the husband.

The Signet, Kersteken, suggested it would be nice to have the scrolls work together somehow. I love Celtic metalwork and thought it would be nice to split the design of an annular brooch down the middle and use that to unite the two scrolls when they are mounted side by side. I was inspired by the Hunterston and Tara brooches and by the enamel medallions on the Ardagh chalice (all 7th century).

I inserted the award device into the brooch design. It's a little loud but what can you do. The current Royalty are attaching ribbon seals on their scrolls for this reign, which is great as it frees up space for design.

Materials: Pergamenata, brown micropen, gold, red and purple gouache, india ink.

"event","I was surprised and pleased to be assigned the Court Baronetcy stepping-down scrolls for the Rising Waters investiture. Their Excellencies have early period Norse-Anglo Saxon personas as I understand it, and I have a soft spot for Aibhilin.

Master Hector had provided wording in advance using a Norse alliterative poetry format. I decided to do matching scrolls that would look good hanging side by side.

I am drawn to Celtic metalwork and my inspiration for this set is St. Patrick's Bell Shrine, an 11th century ""house reliquary"" whose ""roof trees"" on each end of the box are beautifully decorated with gold filigree and enamel. The design is said to be created by Irish craftsmen heavily influenced by Scandinavian design. As a Baron and Baroness protect and nourish an entire community, I thought erecting a golden roof-tree shelter with twining knotwork and enamel medallions over the words of praise for their service would be appropriate.

I did look at their heraldry (oak leaves and thistles) but I didn't see an easy way to tie it into the design as this sort of knotwork is highly stylized and adding acanthus-like shapes (for the oak leaves) would change the entire aesthetic right away. I also looked at their heraldic colours but decided to stick with red, black and gold in the medallions, which were inspired by the enamelwork on the 7th century Ardagh Chalice.

I did the design freehand once I had a reference point. I played around with the compass but the freehand result was better so I stuck with it. As pergamenata is translucent, I was able to trace through onto the second scroll once I had the first design ready.

I used a brown micropen to finalize the design. Then I used gouaches in red and gold plus india ink.

On Friday night I sat down to do the calligraphy in Elder Futhark runes. I used an A-5 nib. Once I had the rhythm going I didn't dare stop but did both scrolls in succession. My hand was cramping and I was afraid I would screw up otherwise. Before I finished the first scroll I had memorized the alphabet and barely referred to it during the second scroll (except for the W, which looks like a sharp-edged P). I was pretty happy with the results. The calligraphy is reasonably consistent.

"event","I volunteered to take a scroll for Crown. I was surprised and pleased when it turned out to be a Scarlet Banner for Baroness Nicolaa, my Laurel . Her Excellency has a fairly strong persona and so I wanted to design a scroll that respected it with a 13th centry Anglo-Norman feel, a style I haven't really done before.

So I dug around the online British Library and found a few examples that I liked from manuscripts such as the Anglo-Norman verse Life of St. Edward the Confessor (wow! Bayeux-style storytelling), Guillelmus Gemmeticensis (Gesta Normannorum ducum), Royal 12 F XIII, Harley 4664 f.145v (lovely historiated initial of a fool), Royal 1 D 1 f.4v of Martin and the beggar, Arundel 233 f. 96v (historiated initial D for Domine, Psalm 101) and Harley 928 f.30 of Margaret emerging from the belly of a dragon (Lauds of the Virgin).

Some of the scans had good views of their accompanying Gothic-y text. I'm not very familiar with Gothic but these examples look more transitional than pure Gothic yet not Carolingian either. I only have one book of calligraphic alphabets and it's not very good. I tried the Gothic example that looked most like my examples but it just didn't flow, so I ignored it and copied out a rough alphabet from the extant samples. That felt much better.

I had been reading The Troubadour's Song by David Boyle, so for the text initially I looked at trouveres verse from the 12th century, including some from Blondel de Nesle, (according to Boyle likely one of Richard the Lionheart's lovers, yeesh. Gotta love sensationalistic history). Richard the Lionheart himself had written some songs and in one he used the same line to end each stanza for dramatic effect. This attracted me. I had decided to compare Nicolaa to the Roman goddess Diana (because the award was for archery), so I came up with the French line ""Par raison on l'appelle Diane"" (10 syllables) (""For good reason they call her Diana"").

I did look at writing 2 or 3 stanzas of 7 lines or so, 10 syllables each. In the end I decided not to bother versifying the whole text as my calligraphy is not small and I would run out of space too fast. But I kept the Diana line. And rather than make the line a lacuna in a sea of English I decided to write the whole scroll in French - which caused an issue later :-) The other reason was that Nicolaa did my Award of Arms scroll several years ago in French, which touched me, and I felt this was a chance to return the favour.

For the illumination I wanted to incorporate elements of Nicolaa's heraldry. Nicolaa has a registered device that includes a gold pall, red crescenty-things, and counter-ermine (white bits on black). The award she was to receive has black wolves, a red wavy line and white for contrast. I wanted to use blue for contrast.

I decided it was best to historiate the N in her name, making the N gold, enclosing a scene of Nicolaa drawing the bow wearing a red dress wearing her characteristic veil and her coronet. The historiated initials found in this style of illumination often have diapering or chequey-style grids with little dots, ermines and other tiny designs in white, gold or sometimes red or blue on a contrasting background. Sometimes the grid lines are marked.

So I laid out a grid on the entire initial but I didn't consider the fact that the outer border of the initial should have had its own grid. As a result the border diapering of counter-ermine (black with white bits) is too infrequent and off-rhythm.

For the image of Nicolaa with the bow I was guided by an early 14th century ms (MS 47682, f.40, c. 1327-1335). It was later than my other sources but at least I could see the archer's stance. Unfortunately he was facing the wrong way and I didn't do a very good job reversing the stance. More importantly I could NOT draw a decent face (typical last-evening procrastination). I repainted it in white half a dozen times and finally gave up. Believe me, the blank white mask on the final is far better than the various haggish Joker visages I drew.

Initially the background in the initial was completely white but it looked too stark, even with some little gold dots in the cross-hatchings. I had already done the azur border around the Scarlet Banner device, so I decided to fill in some of the diamonds in the initial with blue. I left some blank and the overall effect is nice.

The wolves on the device turned out well, but they are rather individual and not the mirror images they should be.

I didn't have time to work out marginalia (e.g. using her comet badge or any of her favourite things like cats or ice wine <gr>) so I feel the scroll is a little bare, not as dressed as it should be. I didn't find a place to use her red crescents either. However, I did slide in some white work on the gold N and some extra dots on the blue border of the award device. I also outlined some of the text capitals in blue or red and added a row of multi-coloured circles, an element I saw in Harley 4664 f.145v.

Note: I get the impression from some that whitework is hard. But after messing with tiny red dots on 8th century illuminations the whitework I attempted didn't seem too bad. What I found hard was not screwing up the counter ermine. I drew them in with pencil before I did the black fill, but had some trouble keeping them clean, so the diamond points are not that great.

I am not happy with the calligraphy as I didn't really understand the hand and I was rushed. Probably the best examples are towards the end of the first column where the rhythm and tightness look best. On the second column I was working around some damp paint and the angle of letters keeps changing. I was writing the text from memory at some points rather than from my pre-printed herald's copy, and as a result committed an error in translation that is not on the herald's copy - ""champ de l'archerie"" should have been ""champ d'archerie"". I also wrote patiente as patientente (the hazards of breaking a word across two lines) and had to use some white paint to cover it up. If I had more time I would have figured out a little marginalia for that too, but as it was I was still up to 5 am the day of Crown. Such is my life.

We couldn't stick around for Court as our guest needed to attend a Masquerade in Guelph, so I missed the presentation. I am quite sorry as I was looking forward to it, and I mercilessly chivvied Nicolaa's husband Gunther to let us know how it went. It's not often one gets to do an award scroll for one's Laurel! Especially one who has done two of my award scrolls.

As Nicolaa does the court heralding I was curious to find out how they would hand off that scroll. Beaudoin had been there earlier and reads French so I thought they would grab him, but he left early as well, so they hauled in Baron James Mercer. Hope he didn't have any problems.

Materials: pergamenta, gouache (cadmium red, ultramarine blue, white, gold), india ink, 000 brush, nib pen (C-4?), pencil, brown micropen.

"event","So once a month we hold an A&S Sunday at our apartment. Today's was pretty good. House cleaned up fairly easily, I made chocolate cupcakes and lasagne, took some new people fabric shopping at Len's Mills, pulled out a mass of pretty portrait/fabric/costuming books, looked at fabric from our stash and finished off by critiquing Bram Stoker's Dracula. Nice time. And not too cold driving the folks home.

I told two of the girls I would help fit bodices for them Tuesday night at the meeting. One picked up some buttery yellow brocade; the other some pinky-silver brocade with gold patches. Both fabrics have potential. The ladies tried on my Venetian dresses previously and like 'em, and the essential style is not too difficult for a first dress.

Albrecht updated his YouTube Hallowe'en Mix (only slightly cheesy) and we used it to help us clean house earlier. I can do without the Monster Mash but I can't go without Bark at the Moon.

I've been eyeing a couple of my silk sarees for a potential new Venetian ensemble. One is a dark bluish rose, the other is a lighter rose with gold tones. We're not saying PINK here; rather something fairly restrained. Gotta think about it some more. But mayme Mama will have a new bag (warning: pun on obscure 80's pop song. Think City TV).

Have a scroll to do for next Saturday. Need to look at my research again and get inspired.

One thing I tried to express to the ladies today was the incredible continuity in fabric motifs from the Coptic Christian finds to the present. In my books are many beautiful examples of repeating, complex motifs in silk and linen-based brocades, and the same styles and pleasing shapes show up again and again across Europe and Asia for over 1700 years and probably longer. There are regional and religious differences, and sometimes colour vogues, but overall I am more struck by the consistencies.

The tree-of-life emblem is probably the most well-known repeat in fabric brocades, but there is a remarkable example in Great Italian Textiles of a dark purpley-red brocade with an abstracted leaf-like repeat that is very modern in feel. It's amazing it survived but it is truly beautiful. Looking at it few people would say it was a renaissance pattern, as the motifs are angled/flying instead of the straight x-y. I sure hope the dating is right.

One thing I like about the Arts and Crafts movement is that it remembered but lightened certain artifacts of renaissance and Egyptian design and other periods. I don't feel that Arts and Crafts is dilute, and I love the beautiful wedding of less-popular metals, enamel and semi-precious stones in the jewellery as well as some truly airy wallpapers created during that era. There is an air of delicacy mixed with practicality.

Over time I have come to believe that with age and experience the mind develops the formulae necessary to predict or identify certain small personal or family events. There are many small cues we receive or perceive and cannot immediately, consciously interpret but do not throw out just the same. A ""vision"" of a family member's onset of final illness when I didn't know he was going to hospital, a pregnancy identified over a distance of thousands of miles for someone I barely knew, prediction of jury duty for another family member, confirmed the following week, moments of real life. Nothing useful of course, just interesting.

There was a sidewalk sale at the local mall this weekend. Some better vendors lately, including a hermit crab stall (all the shells painted in bright patterns with acrylic paint) and more interestingly to me a hydrostone sculpter who made plaques and shapes with bas-relief renditions of Egyptian and Aztec/Mayan art. Some lovely pieces. Hydrostone is the kind of material that bongs when you rap it. We talked to him about Fair November, a craft sale normally held at the University of Guelph in November, and mentioned to him the Toronto store (don't know if it still exists) called Urban Archaeology. That store tended towards more Greco-Roman designs along with some Gothic-y stuff."

So I am constantly looking for new memes and quotes and strategies and tactics. I play with holistic vs. detailed approaches, I make lots of lists, I try to track progress, but in the end things often seem to come down to deadlines. Like the clothes for the Althing. Like a scroll due on a specific date.

I have lots of real life excuses (family, two young children, commuting, involved job etc.) and I get sick of talking about it. I just wish I could find a magical cure so I could stop being consumed with everyday busyness and media distractions, stop thinking I have to automatically sacrifice what ""I"" want for everybody else's needs, and actually achieve what I want more often.

Yeah, ""schedule time for myself"", I've heard that before. I'm working on it.

Anyway.

I was assigned a scroll in a style I haven't really worked in before. The recipient has a fairly strong persona in that period so I'm hoping to do a creditable job. Today I visited some sites and printed off some quality exemplars and found the calligraphic alphabet I will need.

Then I got groceries, took Matthew to a birthday party at the local conservation area (nice day for it, no rain, not too cold), tried to look at cars but no salespeople on duty on Sunday (whaa? that's when I have time!!!), ate a late lunch, started the slow beef stew, picked up Matthew, cut up the vegetables for the stew and then assembled a pear-plum-apple crumble.

The living room is an utter death trap. Our daughter is more dedicated to destroying than we are to tidying. In 30 seconds she can ruin what took us 15 minutes to pick up. Squalor.

After viewing several manufacturer sites and talking to lots of disgruntled people I think I want a used Toyota Sienna with fairly low kilometres (cheaper than Honda but very similar reliability). Speak now, or .... The Pontiac Trans Sport is getting really creaky, the electronics continue to die and the transmission is whining again. I wish Store'N'Go was universally available. Moving the 3rd row seats in and out of the current van is traumatically hard every friggin' time.

I am liking my pale ""lichen"" purple wool Norse coat with the red and gold Frankish pin so much that I want to make it a signature piece. Want to dress up the edges with some kind of edge binding and fix the heavy cuffs into place more securely.

David took care of all the cleaning, vacuuming, bathrooms etc., kept the kids out of my hair, and picked up last minute supplies for me.

This is probably the first big dinner where we haven't had to run off detailed lists to get everything done. We've finally had enough practice and actually the place looked pretty good and all the food was cooked at the same time. We didn't get into each other's face and I didn't get stressed until around an hour before the guests were supposed to get there, probably a record for me.

So the first thing I did, bleary faced, was to bake a pumpkin pie spiced with cinnamon, cardamom, allspice and nutmeg. While that was baking I scalded the milk and butter for the white rolls as it has to cool down before you can think about adding yeast to it.

Then I sliced 2 English cucumbers very thinly (unpeeled) and covered them with kosher salt, sugar, some vinegar and fresh chopped dill. It's a kind of Scandinavian fresh pickle that I picked up many years ago.

Then I peeled a bag of potatoes and put them in water to soak. By this time the rest of the family was awake and starting to percolate.

Then I started my ice ring. I have this jelly mold with rose shapes that makes perfect ice rings. Pour in 1"" water, let it freeze, then place orange slices with a cherry at intervals along the sides, let them freeze to the ice, then keep topping with water until it's full.

I peeled carrots, chopped them into wedges and stuck them in a pot with water to wait. Meanwhile I yoinked the neck and paper sack of organs out of the turkey and threw them in a large pot with water, onion, carrots and celery, sage and thyme from my mother's garden, pepper and a little salt and set it to boil to make the giblet gravy.

Then I started the rolls. Matthew helped me mix in the flour, a cup at a time. It takes 7 to 8 cups of flour. After the 4th cup the balloon whisk doesn't work and I move to a long curved dough stick that I bought at a yard sale. It tames the thickest dough. The kitchen was warm from baking the pie, so it was easy to get the dough to rise.

Then I made some pastry for the apple pie and stuck it in the fridge to firm up.

Then I made cranberry sauce and warned the kids out of the kitchen. The sugar syrup can be dangerous if allowed to sputter (napalm anyone?) but no injuries. Once it had boiled down a little I threw in the package of fresh cranberries and in just a few minutes the skins had popped and it was, suddenly, jelly. Beautiful.

Once the rolls had risen the second time and been baked, I threw together the Granny Smith apple pie. It was a little more spicy than usual (I was lavish while grating the nutmeg) but still acceptable.

Then it was turkey time. We had brined the turkey for 24 hours in a bath of water, kosher salt, orange quarters, fresh ginger slices, peppercorns, star anise, mustard seed and a bunch of other things. Now I wiped it dry and put it in my industrial catering pan to roast. I stuck the ginger pieces and star anise in the cavity to keep scenting it, and I swapped the bird down with a mixture of butter and honey which bronzed it very quickly.

When the turkey was 2/3 done I quickly made stuffing with 5 slices white bread, 3 stalks celery, 1 onion and more sage and thyme, moistened with butter and turkey drippings and stuck the pan at the bottom of the oven.

I had planned to make a pumpkin cake as I picked up a cool recipe from work, but just didn't have time. I think I'll make it tomorrow in a bundt pan with the excess as cupcakes and bring it to work as a treat.

I put the potatoes and carrots on to boil while I got cleaned up and dressed. Then I dressed the table with pretty layered fabrics that my son and I bought on sale at Fabricland (black with a tiny gold acanthus pattern, covered with a sheer bronzy fabric with golden starflake shapes) and put out our glass dishes and the silverware. The rolls were in a white tablecloth in my seagrass basket, flanked by the pumpkin and apple pies, a bottle of wine, the punchbowl, cranberry sauce and dill pickle, then the mashed potatoes (I love my old-fashioned ricer!) mixed with butter and cream, and the bowl of carrots. Then the beautiful turkey was ready. I finished off the gravy (yes, mine is scratch, like everything else here, thank you very much) and poured it into the boat.

We received two beautiful flower arrangements from our guests (thank you Doughall and Gunther & Nicolaa!) in autumn colours which really finished the display.

Once we announced dinner I carved the bird onto a platter and set everyone loose. Strangely enough all I felt like doing for the first 15-20 minutes was to sit and beam at everyone eating and enjoy how happy everyone was. One of our guests was a little held up by traffic so after she arrived and had a chance to get her plate I started to feel a little more like having something myself.

Today we have ignored the dishes and snacked on leftovers and watched movies, which is the best way to spend the rest of the weekend. Breakfast was pie. Yum. David thought the pumpkin pie was all gone and was mourning over the empty plate, but I suddenly recalled I had baked some leftover pumpkin custard in a mini pan. It was great to present him with this little flower-lobed pan filled with yummy pumpkin stuff.

My turkey sandwich is making me dopey now (Hello Tryptophan! Word of the Week!) but I never regret cooking my brains out for good friends."

"event","You can blame that new penguin cartoon show for today's title. It's actually somewhat witty, and I love the voice characterizations.

Nice to labour at home today instead of at the office.

Today is supposed to be our Indian Day. To start things off, Albrecht played the Rowan Atkinson Indian restaurant ""After the Game"" sketch. Going to make a slow chicken curry and basmati rice and watch Monsoon Wedding. Oh yeah, and process buckets of laundry, cycle the kitchen and get more work done on our Norse clothes for the Althing.

Albrecht and the kids are watching remastered Star Trek episodes (Tholian Web anyone?). No escape from Trek this weekend, it seems.

Lots of good food this weekend. Oven baked chicken Friday night, bacon Saturday morning, beef stir fry with odon that night, fancy pancakes Sunday, a big 'ol steak dinner Sunday night with fresh cob on the corn and sauteed mushrooms followed by very late strawberries (not so good, kind of woody), then today we had peameal bacon sandwiches for brunch.

Yesterday I took everyone swimming at probably the best pool in Guelph - 3 indoor pools, various temperatures and depths, slides and shower trees. Elizabeth had a great time. I love family change rooms. Much easier to herd cats.

I was thinking of going over to Nicolaa's for the stitch'n'bitch but I just can't face driving today and leaving my kids at home. The roads will be full of stressed-out vacationers backed up from Milton, and I don't need that. I'd rather wash some dishes."

"event","We have been fomenting cool clothes for the Althing next month. I have always regretted discovering the SCA in Eoforwic too late to catch the first Althing, Novgorod or the Italian event.

Our little quest began just before Pennsic with Tsivia's post about fire-sale prices on linen-cotton and linen-silk noil fabrics at Fabricland. I grabbed 6 yards of everything I liked, including a deep madder red linen blend that is just gorgeous.

Down at Pennsic I found some nice embroidery threads and we both got to-die-for brooches - Albrecht picked up a Norse rooster brooch and I got a Frankish red and gold enamel uber-pin that he successfully ""traded"" for somewhere, said negotiations probably involving armed henchmen saying ""YEAH"". He also picked up a heavy white linen shirt that will do for most early period stuff.

After Pennsic I raided my wool bins and found enough to make Albrecht a tunic in dark purple light-weight wool, a good orangey-brown for Matthew and a rather organic blue that will be a cloak piece for someone. I'm going to dress Elizabeth similar to myself with a miniature apron dress over little tunics. I might even make myself a ""Norse cap"" albeit I consider these more Yorkish than anything.

But I wanted something more. Reading through Carolyn Priest-Dorman's notes, I was intrigued by the Norse coats found in some burials. Although these are apparently Birka-area rather than Icelandic, and probably Rus-inspired, they sounded cool. Now as it turned out, while we were visiting my mother in Gananoque the 1812 reenactors were in town and there was a fabric merchant. Her prices were high, but she had a ""boiled wool"" in a nubby greyish brown that I loved, so I bought just over 7 metres for $100.

So Albrecht's purple tunic is assembled. I'm going to bind the collar and cuffs with a piece of tawny gold shot silk that I am hoping to embroider a little. His long coat is cut out. Although I did his tunic by hand, I'll probably do the coat and most of the other items on the machine as I don't want to run out of time.

We don't have an A-frame and probably won't, but I was taken by Albrecht's description of Sigridr's tent covered with (probably Jellinge-inspired) norse shapes. If I have time I want to do a white banner with a Norse interpretation of Albrecht's device and his new brooch.

Having lots o' fun. Albrecht is getting excited!"

"event","I am making this an open post as maybe my SCA family will find it illuminating.

There has been a lot of ugliness in my life the last 18 months. Stuff at the workplace (you name it, it happened), my father's long illness and death (breathing apparatus now make me sick instead of vaguely curious), negative social politics and a larger than usual dose of bad world news.

When faced with bad, one fights to maintain, overcome or ignore. Just keeping going is the important thing until it passes.

I thought that my strong family life would neutralize the toxic effects of the ugliness (after all, none of it was self-inflicted so no side helping of blame/guilt) but this protection has not been absolute.

This lengthy bad spell has done something to me. It's not irremedial, and recognizing it now will go a ways to correcting it, but it needs to be said.

I've always been somewhat shy and quiet (but never mentally!) but now this is starting to border on neurosis - fear of joining gatherings/not feeling welcome. For example, I could NOT go to the CD release party at Trilliums as I felt I had to be personally invited (how stupid is that!) and I didn't feel I could join other campfires. I stuck to home base and my camp work.

Lately when people approach me I immediately tense for trouble. Very much a learned stimulus-response situation - those who know what I do for a living and some recent history may see exactly how logical this is. And there has been a lot of trouble, so bracing for impact has made a lot of sense.

I am suspecting everyone of hidden agendas. My native suspicion is taking over, along the lines of ""Who would want to talk to me unless they had a bone to pick"" sort of thing.

Kind of puts a damper on one's social life.

I'm not mad, but I'm not feeling too great.

Now here's the segue to part 2 of my story.

Like everyone else in the SCA, I've been exposed to my share of politics, enough to make me shy away from canton-level activity with some legitimacy. I got a strong enough taste of it from people at higher levels to make me disgusted with the whole advancement process. I said to myself, Who in hell would want to be a peer if you have to work with people like that. I guess you could say that I lost faith, not in the pursuit of excellence, but in the SCA's fundamental good will.

It was moot to me anyway, as I had a new baby to look after, but as I started to emerge from the 2.5 year hiatus that pregnancy and childbirth impose on extra-curric, I took up my crafts again with a blighted spirit. I was very lonely and I felt my isolation followed me to events and wrapped me like a cloak.

Now I'm not saying that all this has gone poof with a magic wand, but I want to point out a couple of things that happened at Trilliums.

I went over to Kersteken to deliver 2 scroll blanks, and for the first time was able to find out who Rachel is. Everyone at this point is laughing their @sses off, but I don't tie names and faces well, if ever. I saw this little middle-aged lady in black with Kersteken. And later, at Court, I heard that she had done this and that gorgeous scroll.

At Court, I saw people get awards. The awards were for A&S, and Martial, and Service, and all that. It was fun and exciting and everyone was happy.

But later on I was thinking about what, to my mind, united all of the recipients. Remember, everyone, that I was entrenched in suspicion mode. Earlier in the day a couple of friends had given my family a bunch of valuable useful stuff and all I could think was Why? What did we ever do to deserve it? and How will we make it up to them? I felt even more indebted, if this makes sense.

But I thought about the recipients and I guess I would describe the uniting quality as a universal generosity of spirit.

And this generosity isn't the kind of forced obligation (""I will do X and Y at ABC event because it is on my to-do list"") but the thoughtful kind that looks at people in their orbits, proactively identifies needs, real or potential, and tries to match them up with resources to hand.

(insert gospel choir here)

Whether or not I personally knew or even liked the people who were recognized, I could point to many generous, kind or thoughtful things I knew each person had done, not as part of a checklist drawn up in expectation of an audit but rather a balance of mindful action and heartfelt impulse, again focussing on individual needs.

Oh hell, I had some better words this morning but this will have to do.

I really welcome comments on this one."

"event","We almost froze last night. REALLY cold. Albrecht told me this morning he was concerned he would get hypothermia. But the kids were well bundled up, it was just us who didn't have enuogh blankets. A fridge-cold breeze was blowing on our faces all night. I really didn't sleep.

Got back to the house at 3:30 pm. Not too much traffic along the 401. I'm really tired. Have my yearly packing-up sunburn (never manage to put on enough sunblock on the last day).

Quite an exciting Court last night, we have some very happy people in Ealdormere today. Congrats to Baroness Nicolaa, soon-to-be-Mistress Gaerwen, THL Daffydd and many other folks. It was nice to see Gunthar get his Scarlet Banner - just last week I asked Albrecht if he had one, and we were going to check the OP - but no need now! :-)

Camping-wise the event was very good prep for Pennsic. I got basically all my logistics right - food worked out well, love my new camping kitchen from Canadian Tire (it passes the packing test in the field!!!)

Now I need to make some more clothes. Tunics for me, hopefully finish Albrecht's KRM outfit (black brocade). I also want to make a display scroll in the Lindisfarne style for the A&S display at Pennsic.

Gerrard Carpentarius has had a banner week (except for his car) - won two of 3 rapier tournaments and came 2nd in the third, if I understand correctly.

I wish I'd had a chance to throw axes but it didn't work out. I had promised 2 scroll blanks to the Signet for the An Tir presents - thought I could give them to her at Pennsic but it turned out the deadline was Trilliums. So I brought my scribal box and painted them on Saturday morning. They turned out well, although I nearly lost one to the strong breeze. It went sailing down the grass but didn't get stained.

We had a visit from the XBox Fairy which was cool and most unexpected. Matthew is nagging to go on the XBox but he has to convince us by doing some work in the house first. It is an incredible mess in here post-camping. Looking forward to a long hot soak in the tub.

I wish I had tomorrow off to recover but tomorrow is a big day at work. No rest for the wicked.

Thank you Jocelyn for being there."

"event","to say bed is lonely without ginny home is an understatment. Though my dogs try to fill in the void, lol, its just not the same. I do miss her, alot, Last year she was only gone for 2 weeks and that was ok. After spending nearly every waking moment for the last almost 5 years with someone by your side, it is hard not to have them at your side for an extended length of time. I wish that Chuck and Joanne were still living near, it would make things a lot easier. Its hard to go do things alone. I've done well, but with no one to share the expierences with, its kinda empty. 16 more days...."

"event","I know its been like forever since i've posted, I've been trying to stay busy while ginny is gone. Six weeks is a long time, and still 16 more days until I go out to see her. Its been a good thing, to have time to think and put things into perspective. Since having time to talk to Chuck at length about the trial and tribulations that we both share in have a 24/7 M/s relationship. I've found that my problems are not unique and that even the most expierenced Dom and slaves run into the same problems that me and ginny have.

I've come to realize after having things put into a different scenario ( for those who have red ginny's post about horses and M/s similarities) that I need to focus more on keeping her mind set more focused on who and what she is. For her this needs to be done daily through a structured and stable enviroment. Now i know that real life rears its head daily in every relationship, but I need to keep her on task and in mindset. 

I admittedly, have allowed her way too much slack when it comes to enforcing her rules and daily chores. I can make a hundred excuses as to why, but bottom line is that I faild to keep up my end of the Master/slave relationship, which is to nurture and allow her slave anture to flourish. No more. Thats not to say that I'm going to be a tyrant or anything like that, for everyone that knows me , I'm not like that. What it does mean is that alot of things are going to change, in both of us, There isn't going to be anymore of the sit around and watch tv or play on the computer mentality. We will be doing things both inside the realm of our M/s relationship as well as outside, things that will challenge both of our minds. 

I have been working hard to get myself into shape, no more laziness, while i have had my problems with that in the past, I am cutting back my hours at work to help with the fatigue i had been suffering from. This will also help because i will be able to spend more time with ginny and thus more time to nurture and guide. 

Things ahve been pretty good while she was gone, I've made it to the club a few times, and though i haven't been able to get together with people like i was hoping. I cherish the time i get to spend with each and everyone at the club and outside. I'll be at the club on the 15 to work security for bound and at the club for vending at LF&P, I wish i could stay for the night but i'll have to get everything together for my flight sunday morning. I am going to be vending alone this time, so drop by, say hi


Oh and i almost forgot, I bought a kilt, I'll be wearing that to LF&P, in true Scottish fashion, lol"

"event","Another day in paradise, had a slight headache all night last night at work, came home went to bed, now its a LARGE headache, though its kinda strange, the pain, is localized to one side of my head about halfway between the top of my ear and the top of my head. 

We had a wonderful time over the weekend with chuck and joanne, it was great to reconnect with both of them. I know it was good for ginny, she really misses him and her. As for me I had time to talk to chuck in depth and found that some of the problems i am having about staying on target with the relationship are some he is having as well, so we talked out some ideas that i think will work well, especially with ginny, she really needs to be kept on point in her submission. I , in turn need to stay on point as well and really i need to stay beyond point, in making sure i stay fluid and consistant in directing her mind space.

Ginny leaves in a week, so we are up to our eyeballs in last minute things to get her ready to go. I am really going to miss her for the next 6 weeks, but I am glad she has the oppotunity to spend time there and learn.

We'll see what happens, he's going to bring me the info this upcoming week. The requirements aren't too bad, clean criminal record, backround check and the ability to get a concealed handgun permit, as dispatchers we could be deputized in the event of an emergency.

Had a great trip to pa over the weekend ( you can read all about it in her journal). I just got finished putting my camera stuff away in the cabinet, considering its been living in my camera bag for weeks. Got some stuff organized for the upcoming visit of chuck and joanne, we both can't wait. we haven't seen them in a year, it will be great to be able to spend time with them. 

We are starting the lists for gins trip, she leaves the 16th of august, so I just got done ordering sweatshirts for her trip and we have to go buy water bottles and socks on Saturday. We have to get the box ready for shipping out ahead of her arriving. Its easier to pack a box full of her tack then to try to take it out with her.

Anyway, I'm hoping to get down to the club while she is gone, maybe volunteer a few nights, or just simply hang out, I miss seeing everyone. That reminds me I'll be vending at LF&P without ginny so everyone has to stop by and see me!!!. A friend of ours will be helping me vend so I don't go out of my mind, being by myself, but I'll be pretty much stuck at the table all day do you'll all have to come over and see me

She asked me about cameras she was looking at buying ( by the way i sent you an email to you livejoural email because i don't have your regular email, you can send it to me off journal Master_Grayson@msn.com) I hope she finds a good deal, I gave her some suggestions from B&H Photo, which is about the only place i buy camera equipment from.

"event","It has been a pretty good week, G has had two shoots this past weekend, and I'm very proud of how hard she is working on her modeling stuff. It's a huge help with getting ready for the colorado trip. The extra money really helps, considering how expensice all the horse stuff can be.  

I've been thinking about selling one of the camera lenses that i haven't been using, and buy another that has a better review. I have a nikon 70-300ED, it takes great images, but the problem is if you are carrying the camera aroudn with the lens on it, the lens has a tendency to creep ( that is the lens slips down to its full extension length and its a pain in the ass). I'm looking at the new tamron 70-300Ld Di, its cheaper thant my lens, meaning that if i sell the nikon lens, I'll have enough to buy the tamron lens and a nikon 50mm prime lens. God, it sucks to have to balance my camera finances like that but, I've gotten good at finding the best quality i can afford for the money. So anyone want to buy a camera lens???, lol

We have another shoot this weekend so it will be another long weekend, working 6 days a week doesn't help. I'm being much more diligent about taking my vitamins and watching what i am eating, i don't want to get sick again."

I have to get going on finishing setting up cases for her as we just figured out that the september LF&P is on the 23rd which is the day before i fly out to visit her in colorado.

I am not exerting enough control over her and her actions. Because of this she is putting up a wall around her and not getting into the mood to play or scene or anything. I will admit, I haven't been doing the best job as her Owner. I have been stressing for months over work, money, and everything else under the sun, to the point ot causing myself medical problems. 

So tonight we're discussing the bills and all of this comes out, leading to the fact that she doesn't want to play, because of what has been happening. Thats all fine and dandy, but apparently it hasn't affected her ability to go and fuck L during their photo shoot. That pisses me off, its ok not to want to play with your Owner, she just goes and plays with someone else. Now granted, i did give him permission to play with her a while ago, but if she doesn't want to play with me, I would not have expected her to go and play with him instead. I'm angry, hurt, and about 20 other words i can't even come up with right now.

Work has been crazy, we have ( or maybe I should say HAD) a plant in New Orleans. So since it was flooded out and they have no clue when it will back up and running, we are doing 6 days a week to pick up the slack, makes it easier to max out overtime, but it doesn't leave very much for the social life. Yesterday I got lucky, we had a mechanical break down and were not able to run my shift, so i got the day off. When i talked to g saturday morning, she had told me the M and Q had asked if we were going to the club, since i was off I emailed M and told her that we were going to go since it probably be november before we get down there again.

Let me preface this by say that M and I have been trying to get together for more than a year, our personalities are so alike its scarey. both very outgoinig and flirty, but at the same time we know what we want when we see it. g and Q are alike as well, they are the quiet reserved opposites to M and Mine's outgoing social butterfly like demeanors.

Anyway, we went down to the club, we invited out friends Jas and gaby to come down as well as it is good for them to get out and meet some more people and get more comfortable. M and Q got there right after we did and she and I immediately started with the verbal bantering that has become our trademark, back and forth, m with her "" I'm not afraid of you "" attitude, and Me with my "" you're ass is mine"" attitude. then we parted while we all made our rounds greeting and visiting with our friends. A little while later in the night i talked to Q and told him that g was his to do with as he wanted for the evening, I could see the twinkle in his eyes, as I know that he has wanted to get a hold of her for a while. I went upstairs to grab a bite to eat, and then went down stairs into the lounge and found m sitting on the couch with 2 other friends of ours. That turned into the first scene, m being held down and toyed with untils she begged to be allowed to cum ( this of course amide her curses of us and our family trees, lol). After a short rest I ventured back upstairs and my eyes were treated to seeing g stripping down for Q in preparation to serve him. ( I love watching her serving others, I am so much a perverted voyeur). So i quietly left them to themselves and went back down with m

Now the physical scene actually started, we had decided that a wrestling scene was in order since we we both saying that we were going to kick each others asses. Well lets just say that m did not get very far with that, but I really enjoyed the physical contact and getting into her head, knowing what to say and when to push her buttons. ( did i hear a zipper?) we connect very well on all levels, We both accept each other for what we are, not trying to be anyone we aren't just being ourselves and letting out feelings and needs take over. ( god how i wish last night was a private party at the crucible, it would have been even hotter). We had about 4 rounds of wrestling, with m loosing ( or is that winning?) each time,  with each round ending in more kissing , grabbing feeling, teasing, etc.. and a few more orgasms for m. We both wanted to take this further, but the night would not allow and we had brought Jas and gaby with us, as well as having out furry children at home that we couldn't stay out all night with Mand Q.

Anyway, i ventured back upstairs to see what g and Q were up to and saw g with a very red ass being made to cum and squirm, which was very pleasurable. The four of us sat on teh couch and talked and basically wound ourselves up into a sexual frenzy , which didn't help matters sinice we couldn't take care of that need then. 

I really want to spend more time with them, they are a very close match for us and I think it will help all parties involved to be able tolet off some steam and be able to cultivate a poly relationship. I really like m, and really want to spend time to get to know her on an everyday basis, or as close to that as i can, they are a lil over an hour away, but We are going to make this work, I am not going to let this slip away for a few miles of distance.

I am pleased that g and i are working on structuring our relationship. I think its helping, its going to be slow going, but i think its well worth the time and effort. i have been giving her small tasks such as last night she had to refer to herself in the 3rd person all night. She had difficulties but its helping her concentrate on where her head should eb, so i have had her continue today. She has done well today, with only 1 or 2 slips. I really want to make her the slave she wants to be, and I need to be the Master she needs. I am going to make this happen as well. I have a lot on my plate, but I am going to make it work"

Anyway, been very busy with photo shoots, getting ready for vacation, getting ready for her trip, and of course 55 hours a week at work. I must say that things have been going well, we are pretty much ready for our vacation, and her trip, we finished up the rest of the purchases for her trip today, buying her new boots and half chaps, yesterday she bought the kit that she needs for the classes. So over $400 later we're ready. I'm really excited for her, I know she's going to have fun out there, plus its in colorado, so its beautiful to boot.

As for our vacation, again, we're ready, we have enough money planned for the trip, though i'm not going to try to spend a whole lot while we're out there ( coupled with the fact that we're both wanting to get at our respective others, that we may NOT get out much, it could end up being a 10 day orgy). As i was saying, going to try not to spend too much, because it can go back into savings for a second car.

My 35mm camera that i bought on ebay finally came in the mail today ( after 3 weeks of waiting) and I wasn't here to sign for the damn thing, so now I have to wait until Tuesday, thats the first day i can get to the post office to pick it up. Gin and I thought that starting with a 35mm SLR would be good practice before going to buy a digital slr. So i am now the proud owner of a nikon n75 with two nikon lenses, a 28-70, and 70-300mm. I can't wait to start playing with it. I'm really getting into this photography thing, I've almost got a mini photo studio, I have 2 hot lights, cameras, tripods, all i need is a back drop and I'm in business. I've been looking over the nikon digital cameras on b@h photo and am trying to decide whether to buy the D70 or the D50, both are almost the same, one major difference is that I would have to buy sd cards for the D50 while the D70 uses CF cards, which i alreay have, i've already decided that no matter which one I buy, i'm getting the new nikon 28-200mm g lens that nikon came out with recently. Since i will already have 2 lenses that can be used with each camera, i thought that this lens will be a good al around lens and keep gin and i from fighting over the long lens if we are both out shooting, lol. I'm going to decide which camera to buy after i get back from vacation. While I'm in california, i'm going to play with Chucks D70 to see how I like it. We shall see price wise there is only a 30 dollar difference so I'm not too worried about that.

I'm sure you all have read about out playing wiht Kristy by now, so I don't have to go into detail about that. I do love to wacth gin when she is really into someone, like she is with kristy, she was sooooo hot that night. I think that its the begining of a fun relationship with the three of us so time will tell. more later tomorrow maybe, love to all"

"event","well the weekend's finally over, god what a long 2 days, but they were 2 wonderful days. We did very well vending thins time, seeling 3 bags alltogether, pretty good for something we do in our spare time. though our day was long, starting at 7am and going till alomost 4am sunday morning, We were both exhausted and about fell over when we got back to our room.

The highlight of the weekend was the wonderful and allways perkily sadistic fortryll carving up my left arm, doing a wonderful cutting. God it was so full of energy and intensity, the energy transfering back and forth was awsome. Mym was there as my support as gin is not good with blood and cutting, add her energy to Fortrylls and WOW, i was in a space where i felt nothing but the energy trasfer, she probably couldhave cut on me for like another hour and I wouldn't have cared, anyway the cutting turned out wonderfully, I'll be posting a link to is shortly, I was very happy that Fortryll agreed to do my cutting, she was the first person i thought of when we began discussing it, there is still another part of my cutting to do....another character, but we'll get to that eventually, I was nervous in the minutes leading up to the cutting, kind of like a newbie doing their first scene, but she made me feel completely at ease with everything, explaining each step of the process. I went into a very nice head space as soon as she touched me, She has a very soothing touch, coupled with her energy, its enough to calm the deepest of anxieties. Again i was honored to have her bless me with her cutting skills and honoerd to have me friends present to witness the event, it is a very deep and meaningful thing.

more later when i get the link ready"

"event","While talking about the poly side of our relationship last night, I cam up wiht a cool analogy for how the different relationships work. I call it the different room theory....


think about your home, and the rooms in it, none of them are exactly the same and in most cases they are totally different. Our poly relationship works in kind of the same way... going into each ""room"" offers something unique and different from the other ""rooms"". Different partners offer different expierences to the relatioship, essentially having a room of their own that may offer soemthing that other partners cannot. In some cases, these room have windows allowing glimpses into the other relationships, which in turn can be used to strenghten and deep the primary relationship. I know it sounds kind of strange but it seem to work in my mind and in gins. 


more later when i have time, and someone that reads this journal, owes me a name, and she knows who she is"

She woke me when she gor home and told me a lil of what happened wiht Daddy, I was about ready to jump on her right then., but she needed to eat, so we went out to pizza hut. 

When we got home we got into the shower it was then that she got in depth about what had happened with her and Daddy, even though it wasn't much it served to wind me up further. The DOM came out in me, I got very vocal and degrading ( two things she really loves) fucking her in the shower, biting, pulliing, some breath play, I could tell she was off the deep end, as she was wobbling on her feet and tears were begining to flow. I sent her out of the shower and into our bed room to kneel on the bed, where i took her forcefully once again, all the while not allowing her to achieve the orgasm she needed and wanted. Again pulling away from her i ordered into the basement, where i followed, armed with my slapper, box of clamps and her vibrating toys. the scene was very very intense, i was not easy on her using the slapper hard and clothespinnning her nipples and breasts, then took her again as the clmaps and pins bobbed on her breasts and nipples. I took them off only to put her on the futon and start again, at one time hearing placing the clothes pins back onto her nipples and took my pleasure from her body, finally allowing her her release as well, after, we lay together going over the scene and we cane to a few conclusions.

Being in a poly relationship its not good to use what is doen with another partner against her in the scene, I was driving home the fact that she did something wiht Daddy that she doesn't do with me. While it doesn't seen like a big thing, it has a profound affect on her mental state in the scene, she was afraid I was angry with her about, andeven though through the scene she came to know better it is not good to place a doubt like that in her head. Her head space tonight was deeper than I have maybe ever had her before, I have been putting alot of thought into how to accomplish that on aregular basis, and this is a good start, now I just need to figure out how to keep her in her mindset.

One of the big reasons our poly relationships work is that she can get different things from each of the partners she is involved with. I helps to keep things fresh and new as well as serves to broaden her expierences and hopefully help her to achieve a deeper head space in all aspects of the relationships. I know that in some relationships it is easy to get jealous over something that may happen between your partner and her other play partners. but the fact is, in thinking about it, you should be happy that she is able to have something that is exclusively "" theirs"", a special things that is shared between them to deepen and broaden their own connection.


enough for now, I have to get to bed"

"event","only one more dayof night shift left, thank god, I mean its nice because there are no Big Bosses running around being pains in the asses, but its still a bitch having to work when everyone else is asleep. Got to do cardio today, as I did nothing yesterday. 

I'm also planning to redevote myself to the art of rope bondage, I've grown to used to using cuffs and chains. I cant remember half of what I've learned, so its time to get back to basics. Gin is in for a long stint as my testing subject as i get my skills back and improve them, lol, I'm sure you'll all hear about it. I'm also going to be working harder on continuing her training and working on her head space on an everyday basis, its going to take some time, but the end result is worth the effort

well I'm off to get her up and send her off to work and get myself to bed"

"event","well I ended up staying over this morning at work, not leaving till almost 8, i got home showeredand took g to the dmv to get her dl changed over to a maryland one. Before leaving we looked at the website to see what we needed to take, it was all very confusing, so we went over , only to find that she needed her bitrh certificate, which is still in NC. She got really mad (its pms week to boot), and started snapping at me, I can't help it if we needed stuff we didn't have, it wasn't my fault, I got really angry, but managed to keep from loosing my temper. I know that during her pms week, she's not the easiest person to live with, so I try to keep everything in perspective. So instead of this escalating into a fight aver the stupid dmv I got ready and went to bed, I figured that we both needed time to cool off and sure enough everything was better after I got up, so alls well that ends well on that. We went out this evening looking for a battery for our cordless phone and found the right type only to get it home and the plug doesn't match, thats just the way our day has been, lol. At least we had a nice dinner at panera bread...mmmmmmm  broccoli&chees soup. 

Well its off to work in a little over an hour so I'll see ya'll tomorrow"

My boss will be very happy as well, to have his best operator back. anyway, I looked online this morning and my new camera bag will be here today, yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, getting tired of having to stuff everythign into the smaller one, add that fact that i have bought more things for the camera, made a larger camera bag a must.

I think I'm going to do somthing mice for dinner tonight, soemthing fun and romantic, nothing major just a lil somethign to make her smile. I love to do little things to make her happy, becasue she works so hard to please me and to take care of all the things a good slave should, she makes me very proud, each and every day. I try to tell her that all the time, because she is such a good girl.

Well, I guess I'll go change clothes and wait for her to get home, I don't want to write too much , lol afterall I don't want to become another one of thos ""ljwhores"" lol"

"event","one thing i did forget to mention..... don't think for a minute that i don't recieve gratification from my girls other relatioships, its a huge turn on to watch her play as well as hear about it later, it really gives the two of us a charge that we both enjoy. I am probably the biggest voyuer on the planet so wathing her gets me all would up and usually leads to hot scenes of our own later. I just wish i had the time to develop the same type of relatioships that she can, there just aren't enough hours in the day"

"event","I hate this fucking journal already!!!!! I just poured out a half hours worth of post and went to spell check it and it deleted the whole thing!!!!!


 well I guess I'll try again:

Another weekend come and gone and its back to work tomorrow, We had a great time, we hooked up with kat and Brutus and had a nice shoot with the two of them. We ran some errands today and got some things accomplished so all in all its been good.

I've been thinking alot reccently about finding a regular play partner, but then reality rears it ugly head hmmmmmm... I work 55 hours every week usually 6 days a week hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... so when in the hell would i have time for that???... I'll tell you the answer...probably never, but thats the price I pay for being principle provder in the household. Gin has quite a few that keep her occupied, she now has a regular play partner, not to mention Sir and his girl, who, even being 3000 miles away still play a major role in her life, and then there is kat and the shoots, thats not really a emotional relationship, but a play relationship all the same. We have been poly for a little over a year and her relationships have blossomed and that is great, she thrives on the diversity of her relatioships. I have not had the time to cultivate the same things though, even when Sir and his girl were still living here, it was usually gin going to their house to play wiht them, because i had to work, so usually it was "" thats ok honey you go down and have fun while I'm at work"" and thats ok, its not fair toher to have to sit home and do nothing just because ihave to work. I really never had the time to develop the relationship with j , while the threee of them had the time to develop the bonds of their relationship. it sucks to a point, but as i said, there isn't much i can do about it. Even if i find a play partner, most of the ones i would be interested in live a hour away, then there is my work schedule and my quality time for my relationship wiht my girl, so my ""regular play"" would wind up being like once every 5 or 6 weeks and thats not going to work, for a play standpoint or a relationship building one. Gins regulat play is about once every 7 to 10 days, so its much easier for her to flourish in her relationships, I don't begrudge her that not in the least. she thirves on the diversity of her relationships with others and i would never get in the way if that, it would just be nice to get that same opportunity but given my work schedule and lack of spare time i doubt its going to happen.

anyway, enough of that, on a lighter note, they are calling for heavy snow tomorrow so maybe i can get an extra day off, hopefully they'll close down work tomorrow ( crosses fingers). I need to do some more reading about my new camera, i have been having some problems, mainly hacing to do with shutter spee and lighting so a free day to go over all the bells and whistles on the damn thing would be nice.I would also give me some more time to work out tomorrow. I have decided i need to go back down to under 240, so i need to drop about 30 more pounds. I'm doing weight training and cardio, the goal is to be under 240 by camp so we'll see what happens, it would be nice to be able to pull out some of my old clothes and fit into them again, not to mention be able to turn a few more head when out and about, lol

anyway i hope I remembered everthing i put in the first post i had that got deleted, if there are spelling mistakes in this post, ohh well, I'm NOT going any where near that damn spell check again"

"event","<font color=""#c0c0c0"">Well, Malcolm and me are completely over. Getting over him wasn't as hard as I had thought, thanks to my friends. We're still friends and that makes me sooooooooo happy. Too much has happened in February; get over Malcolm, I turned 15, Tiffany and Ian broke up, Mallory and Anthony are back together, and I have a boyfriend. Nope, not Malcolm, but my best-friend Chris from 1st grade. ""Awww!' *rolls eyes* I hear that all the time.<br />Softball starts on the 13th and I really need to step it up. I'm not getting my glove down on the ground like I should and it's pissing me off like no other! Grrr!!! Other than that, my batting is pretty decent.&nbsp;<br /><br />Babysitting is awesome! The two boys I 'sit are so adorable and I'm learning how to deal with their attitudes. For my birthday, Feb 22nd, I got a gift certificate, $40, and a cake!!! I never wanna give up this job! Also, mom's buying me a piccolo and got me a flute/piccolo case!<br /><br />Theatre is dramatic as ever. We did okay at Regionals but went TEN SECONDS over our time limit... (Yet, we got home 10 minutes before Sadie's started. Dad did take me out and bought me my dress and shoes; Malcolm was my date. I do believe we all had fun.) Denise bruised her hand while packing up our set after we performed. OW!!! Most of us crashed in our homeroom after everything. Beauty and the Beast is very choppy but there's 2.5 months to perfect it.&nbsp;<br /><br />My birthday could've been better but it was fine! Mom gave me the case, friends were their usual selves, day was normal, and then I babysat that night. Mom and I went out to dinner once I got home then I had homework. Most of my theatre friends went all in and bought me Rent, which I've watched 6 times. =D Chris also asked me to be his girlfriend that Saturday but I told him to ask me on my b-day. (I really had to think it over becuase I'm so busy, a flirt, and been single for 9 months!) I said yes and we've been together for a week.<br /><br />Drama is all around us. How we deal with it is our own dramatic episode.<br />Annie, the PoEtIc :D:D</font>"

"event","<P>Heh, well, that last entry... Pay no attention. That was over by the time it started. I don't remember what I said but Greg and I barely talk to each other anymore, heh. So much has happened... I like another techie... Senior... Malcolm. *nods* He doesn't have a hidden girlfriend like Greg did so I did make an improvement. *smiles* I have liked hime for about a month and a half and he likes me too. Grrr!!! We can't have a relationship or date because he's going to college and he would feel like he's taking advantage of me. Oh, the age thing too. Can't forget the age... Malcolm and i have had talks about why we can't really be intimate and over affectionate. There was a time when we were affectionate; holding hands, holding each other, and small stuff like that. This past Saturday we had another talk on why we should go back to being friends. Malcolm, ever so often, does or says things that make me thing of the past and I'm upset for a while, I get over it, everythings good. Well, he doesn't want to hurt me so we're back to being <U>just friends</U>. That hurts me more, knowing that we can't be how we were last week! *shrug* Whatever makes departure less painful...</P>
<P>December went by fast; I visited my cousin Austin down at UofM, he sings opera, had first HS concert, Christmas, eat, drink, and be merry. My mom and I invited Malcolm to the hockey game on New Years; I drank that night and almost spilled my feelings to him. Then in January; became affectionate with Malcolm, tried out for Symphony band (made it), almost killed my knee, mid-terms and babysitting. (I've been babysitting for a while.)</P>
<P>Today Tiffany, Ian's girlfriend/fellow techie, and I got our hair done. It was just a major cut and highlights, for her. Mom won't let me color my hair again. </P>
<P>Theatre is, dramatic. More than likely we are going to Regional competition so everyone can kiss the Sadie Hawkin's dance au revior. (I asked Malcolm :D) Two of our actors won Superior awards at District's this past weekend. Our spring musical is ""Beauty and the Beast."" This will be the show that I am Assistant Stage Manager with Malcolm. He's not going to be here for the next 3 years, I will, and someone will need to be Stage Manager. Drama, softball, babysitting and homework make up my life.</P>
<P>All for now!</P>

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Marching band was a blast but I still miss it. Now for concert I'm playing flute and piccolo. It took a while for Mr. Jones to give me the piccolo. I have it, I love it, and I can play it. No body else in the concert band really wants to play it or they just can't. Yeah, my ego is talking... a bit. hehe</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Yeah, Andrew made me mad that night so I've been avoiding him. I don't like him anymore and I don't know why I did in the first place. Damn players! Quit looking at me! Lately we've been talking online but very scarcely. Last night he <STRONG>told me </STRONG>to call him but 1) It was 10 at night 2) Mom wouldn't let me 3) I didn't want to 4) Louie needed me 5) I like someone else. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>The play, The Jungle Book, went really well. Denise, Greg (a senior), and me flipped these curtains for night and day. After our last flip we'd go backstage and just chill. On Tuesday Greg and Malcolm left Denise,&nbsp;Cait and me at school so we decided to&nbsp;start walking. They seemed not to believe&nbsp;us be we walked all the way to Calkins Road.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;Greg's nickname is Flirt and that's pretty much what he is. I flirted back and feelings grew. *hides* Not again... I would just sit on his lap and we'd talk and kind of flirt. Heckwe flirted. Denise and Cait told me that Wednesday that he had a girlfriend, yeah it hurt but I wanted to see if he'd tell me. Like a stereotypical male, he didn't. I kind of busted him on it Friday. Greg wanted a back massage so I gave him one and Malcolm made a comment about a girlfriend. *</FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>eyes&nbsp;change color</FONT><FONT color=#3366ff>* Whoa buddy! ""You never told me you had a girlfriend"" ""It's a long story. I'll tell you later."" Gah! We then had to leave for the choir room and I really didn't want to be near him. He grabbed my wrist, making me face him. I just glared as he said something about having a girlfriend and not doing this. In the choirroom we did the hand squeeze and he kept holding my hand like we used to. *glare* I was crushed. Back on stage, Greg tells me that he didn't feel the same for his girlfriend and that he was going to break up with her this weekend. Uncertain, I tried to smile and grabbed his hand. Show went on, we hung out backstage, I told Denise what was happening. She tried to keep me from crying. Greg and I hung out until the cast party. I couldn't really eat because of my nerves. We talked that night online and he said that things changed AGAIN. X_X Him and his girlfriend <EM>of almost a year </EM>are still together. Don't flirt if you have a serious relationship, gosh. Feelings get hurt! We reconciled and we're friends now. My feelings for Greg are still how they were, several tears later. The cast party Saturday night was at his house but my mom picked Marie and me up before 11. &gt;_&gt; Greg and I hugged before we left and I asked him what changed over night. He doesn't know how, what he wants, etc. Love is fickle!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Besides that, life is good. All my grades are up in the A, B range. I gave my second speech for Mrs DiGiacomo that I literally pulled out of my tukkus. I went Up North for Thanksgiving. (Bacardi with Pepsi and Smirnoff green apple is really good.) i need to study some more so peace out!</FONT></P>

"event","<P>*sigh* Can I please move to Clarkston, Novi, or Taylor Truman? Why, you may ask.... BECAUSE THEY KICK @$$ and are discipled. Also, I made friends with people frome Clarkston and Truman. Last weekend we made a 7 point improvement, last place, and last night *shudders* We dropped 3 points which wouldn't have helped. Truman still beat us by 6 points. But at Festival last night, I had a little girl kick dirt at me after I had a disagreement with some friends. I wanted to cry so bad and I almost fell in the 3rd movement. Stupid moves that we flutes have to march almost 4-5 instead. The astro-turf at Plymouth-Canton was slippery; I almost pulled a hamstring. Anyway, after I watched some other band, I got in line for something warm to eat. This really cute guy from Taylor striked up a conversation and we hanged out for a while. His name is Andrew XD and plays trumpet. He was soo sweet! I was freezing cold even though I had so much clothes on and he offered me to wear his band jacket. I said no (damnit) and just walked around with him and his friends. Finally, I found Denise and we jsut goofed around. Awards: 9th place, embarrassed by the band, teared up, froze. Going to the bus, I seen Andrew again and he put his arm around me and we exchanged email addresses and he gave me a hug! Holy fruit basket! I miss him but we compete against him and it's kind of awkward... Oh well! </P>
<P>I have a job interview tomorrow at Subway in the mall after school. I put in my application finally and talked to the manager. I'm extremely nervous about tomorrow; not sure what to say but do know what to wear. Dad is going to help pay for Drivers Training next month and Im going over there the weekend after Halloween. And one more festival this weekend. I heard that this own is the hardest besides this weekend. (GL Invitational.) </P>

<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Devin and I went put-putting a couple weekends ago, That was fun and embarrassing because I suck at golf. Then he wouldn't talk to me until this week. It's just been really weird. But things seem to finally be setting down around here. School is becoming more managable, especially Accel. English. This project we got on Monday just was so over-wehlming until I found a book that I could understand and understood the whole project. The lowest grade I have in all my classes is a B. :D Sooo happy about that. Academically, things are going just dandiful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>HoMeCoMiNg! That was soo much fun! No, excellent-awesome-totally-freakin-nifty! Well, Devin didn't go with me because he already had a date. My mom said to invite Derrick, my friend from Kindergarten to come with me. He did and it was absolutely superbed. Him, Marie and me all went together. Marie looked simply divine, Derrick was quite handsome and I was quite a charmer myself. (It was really hilarious to watch Debbie put Derricks buotineer on.) With our hair done, nails perfected (not mine :P), and sucking in our gut, Marie and me were angels for the night. We went to Applebee's and seen some otehr kids from school. At the dance, Haley, Charlie, Nicole, Andrew, Sam, Devin, Cait, Denise, and everyone else was there. Of course, Denise and I danced like how we planned; freakishly hot! I taught Derrick how to dance and slow dance, got Marie and Cait out of their shell and just had a hella good time! Some of us even danced with Wesley, one of the theatre guys. (He's gay so it's all good.)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Theatre: I am going to become a thespian. Tomorrow afternoon we have a work day noon-4 to work on the set for ""The Jungle Book"". I'm quite estacting for that (can't you tell by my ethusiasm...) It's something to keep my friends and myself busy and together.</FONT></P>

Well, most of it was. lol This morning I went to Taras that way I wouldn't have to stand out in the cold but her brother took us to school which was awesome. </FONT><FONT color=#ff9966>I got up with Cait and Kassie before homeroom. Jessi Thoma is in there that I know form softball so that was cool. We just watched a boring powerpoint presentation on the hand book then 1st hour came. I went into the wrong first hour! lol I went a door down when I was supposed to be 2 doors down. There's not a whole lot of Freshmen but Upperclassman that are trying to get their last few credits before graduating. But they didn't have a computer for me so I just pulled up a seat near Tiffany Vaughn (Cait gave me a death glare when I told her.) She was the only person I really knew in the class. Syllabus's and the talk, blah blah blah. On the way to 2nd hour, Dayna and I were supposed to meet up by the stairway because we're upstairs but I couldn't find her so I headed to Geometry. Once I got in there, I seen Dayna...AND CAIT! Major freakin' w00tness! Cait and Dayna and me are all in the same Geometry class...Fun year ahead hehe. And there's this really hot guy named Devin Murphy that sits next to me and he kept looking at me so I introduced myself and we got talking... He is REALLY cute! And he's on the swim team. ;) Finally, a sexy guy in a speedo! lol Unfortuanitly, Brooke Silva and Megan McCartney are both in my class. I don't like them at all ever since 7th grade on the bus. Ms. Sokol just talked and we did an introduction thingy. Stuff like that. From their I went to Phys Ed were the Varsity softball coach is my teacher. How sweet is that?! She just told us the main stuff about her class and that we have softball tomorrow!! Double&nbsp;Sweet! I asked her when weight lifting begins and it doens't start till around the winter...Gr! Just means that I have to do my own work out until then. :( From Gym I went to lunch and Dayna and I walked around for a bit, stalked Chase, then ate. Come to find out, Chase hangs out with the gothic people...Weeiirrdd. We finally went and got some bosco sticks for lunch. We got to eat one then the bell rang. I feel really bad because it's my fault for running around the school and stalking Chase. Band was next and was for a couple hour. Mr Jones just talked about festivals, etc. Accelerated English I is my 5th hour and that seems hard...Well, more-so challeneging so bring it on Mrs. DiGiacomo! Grrr!!! lol I'm really hyped up for tomorrow! We got our syllabus and she talked and talked and talked. We have&nbsp;a quiz tomorrow on one of our books. On the way to sixth hour I passed Chase and he had his book like he was going to hit me but I just punched him on his shoulder. haha He was like, ""Oww!"" and started laughing. I got into Biology and that seems like fun. We had to do a 15 question thingy already. Thankfully we don't get our books for another 2 weeks because Mrs Lawrence is trying to save our backs...Literally. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9966>On the way to homeroom today, I passed Shawn and one of his friends. They called my name and I just turned my head and glared... I didn't want to be late on the first day! I feel really sorry for Marie. She sits behind him in 5th hour. Besides Devin looking good, there was this one guy in the hall I seen that resembled Louie... Just cockier and arrogant. Pssh that! I need to head off... I won't get picked up until 6:45 which means I can sleep in until 5:30 at least. Bye!!!</FONT></P>

Mom and I met up in the kitten adoption area and Shawn's dad taps on the glass behind me so I just turned around and waved. Then they had to come in and look at the kittens. Being in the same small space with Shawn wasn't very comforting. He got his hair cut short in the back with long bangs...similar to mine. XP I'm tempted to cut them off now. Thankfully, that was the last I seen of him until Tuesday. Knowing my luck, I'll have a class with him and probably gym/swimming....NOOO!!! *screams while falling into darkness* Pour quoi?!

We finished putting his classroom in order and went to Office Depot to pick up some file thingies. While he was in the check out line, I went and checked out some digital cameras; There's a couple I liked. I have been thinking about getting one. Once we left, he took me to Burger King and I got lunch. We first went to McDonalds and he turned the wrong way and almost hit comeone head on then almost took a wrong turn but, obviously, I'm still alive. I started laughing and Derek was like, ""Don't be lauging at me,"" and was poking me. It's fun to joke around with him. We then went back to the school and I was writing the student names in ABC order and I put this kid's name after the S's and it was an O. Major blonde moment of the day. </P>
<P>He took me home, I went over to Amandas because she called. She had my money from her sister for babysitting Tuesday. I just stayed over there because I didn't feel like sitting home alone and bored. Once I did come home, I just layed down and watch tv, play my guitar a bit. </P>
<P>For once Mom and I went out to dinner. We went to Red Lobster and there was this little boy that sat behind her and was making too much noise. I was thinking, ""Happy Birthday you little brat now shut up and let me eat my dinner in silence!"" Go figure, when we got our bill, they left. *scowls* I wasn't too happy. Then we came home and I went over to Mallory's to see if she was home, wasn't, and just rode around then back home, got online to the point where I am now.

We were so hyped up before going out ther. But for pre-game, while marching out to the field, I miss my spot but marched back and made it look good. lol My mom just made it for half time.

I changed my name to Gerard and was wearing Nate's ""lucky hat"" and got 4 strikes in a row. That was awesome. Anna was talking to Martini on the phone and I think he asked her what happened cause I heard her say, ""Annie just got 4 strikes in a row.""&nbsp; I was thinking, ""Yeah! What now Flubber?!"" I talked to him for like 10 seconds and at first he didn't realize that it was me. lol Before we started bowling, Anna was playing with a quater and it went half way down a gutter and me being me, I went after it and almost fell on the lane.

The Half Time show is what I'm psyched about! And Nate, Marie, Denise, Anna and maybe Charles and Stacia and me are going bowling tomorrow. Denise forgot to call Aaron so if Stacia and Charles don't go, it'll be the 5 of us. Nate is starting to make it more obvious that he likes me. I told him that I got my hair cut tonight becuase I forgot to tell him a long time ago and he said, ""I'm sure it stills looks good."" Then that I didn't take a shower today, ""You can't stink. Chicks can't, I'm sure you smell fine."" Kinda creepy but the best attention since Louie... Which I think Louie and Bruce might end up hooking up in some kind of relationship. It's like my own version of&nbsp; Laguna Beach because of all this other drama that's already happening before school with relationships, crushes, etc. No date yet for Homecoming.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Tomorrow night is my FIRST marching show! Oh my gosh am I ever hyper and excited for it!!! Weeee! If it's too hot, we're just going to wear our shirts from camp but if someone doesn't wear the right one, we ALL have to wear our windbreakers. XP I will so kill that person if it's hot tomorrow night. But what I think is really hilarious is that for this one cerimonial thingy, we're playing ""The Final Countdown"". That's great, eh? lol</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff>Today I spent my day in my pajamas, making brownies, and looking for scholarships online. I already sent out two that I did online. The others are a poem and some essays. One that should be really easy is ""How Does Playing&nbsp;a Musical Intrument Make You a Better Student?"" That one and this one about science theories which I love because anything is possible. Well, I got to get to bed!</FONT></P>

"event","<P>Well, Denise couldn't come over because her mother decided at the very last moment that she had to stay home and help fix the toliet. That must've sucked. I got to talk to her for a few minutes while she was doing that. I got off the phone with her then 30-45 minutes later, Marie calls me back and I absent mindedly asked her to spend the night. She did and we had our normal good laughs. </P>
<P>We went to bed about 1 o'clock but kept talking and talking and talking and, yeah, talking some more. Marie and I talked till 2 and woke up at a little bit after 10 to go for a walk. That was very up-lifting, if you will.We walked to the subdivision where my old babysitter lives (which is about a mile). Around 11:30 we got back and we ordered pizza because my mom had to get her bus fixed for tomorrow. Within 30 minutes, we both took our showers and got dressed. That should be in the Ginus Book of World Records. lol Our pizza was gooood. We saved some for my mom because we're just nice like that. :D Yeah, right. </P>
<P>Once she got home, Marie and I got online for an hour and looked at dresses seeing who has more of an expensive taste. We're about even. Her step-mom picked her&nbsp;up after 3 then my mom had to go back and completely re-arrange her pick up times and go to the bus garage. I went with her thinking I could help her with the times and all that. She then had to go undo what she did this morning. Mom started to get really teary eyed because this has been really stressful on her. Her one friend ended up taking me home where I just lounged around and munched until she got back home around 6:30. I continued to lounged, eat, watch TV, and play in the rain. </P>
<P>Tomorrow I have to babysit but thankfully I don't have to wake up till 7:45-8:00 and not get there till 8:30-ish. It will be just Robert which mean I'm defiantely bringing my books and my walking shoes. Ethan has school tomorrow and won't get home till his mom does. (3:30) I pray that it will be an easy day for me because I also have band tomorrow and it's our last practice before our first show.</P>
<P>I'm so hyped for our first home game/show! Oh my gosh! I can't explain how happy and excited I am for it! Mr Jones really needs us to work on our pre-game show and our new drill charts. Still, I am confused on where to go and how big of steps I am to take. I stand between the 30 and 35 and go to the inside of the 20. I think it's supposed to be 16 steps or something. Not only am I to worry about that, but if I'm in line with everyone else and playing my music. *sigh* It should be fine. I'm just a rookie, not a 3 year veteran. </P>
<P>Well, all for now!</P>

<P><FONT color=#ffcc33>I had to babysit this morning but I came home only at 10:15! That isn't even worth getting paid. But I came home and my mom was here and I just went directly to bed. Ended up sleeping till 1:45. Yup! I was lazy! :D I feel much better though. Once I got up I just chilled and called Marie. We both wanted to go to the mall but her dumb @$$ father wouldn't let her. But he'll let her go bowling where there are drunken weirdos! Jeez! Then Denise found out that Charles has had a girlfriend for 2 weeks. He so led her on because he told her that he liked her more than a friend when they went to church today TWO WEEKS AGO. He is a player and defiantly not boyfriend material. In the past month he has liked Denise, Melissa, Denise and know Anna....WTF?! Not to mention that he was flirting with every girl at band camp and myself. He tried holding my hand before we did our Big performance at the CMU stadium. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc33>Lately I have been doing nothing but doing differnt things with my hair&nbsp;and watching MTV. My mom left earlier to go do her Parent Visits so I'm home alone for a couple hours. I don't really know what I want for dinner and I'm really hungry. Plus a headace.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc33>Denise, Marie, Anastacie (Charles's sister), and myself are going bowling this Friday. I wish that Bruce and Louie could come with us but we're going late. Denise, Marie and I are probably going to get dolled up because sometimes there are really cute guys where we bowl. Hehehe! :D:D:D </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc33>But what really sucks is that I have to babysit for 8 hrs Friday before we go bowling! But I think I get paid when I get dropped off at home. At the most, I'll make $50 this week. I still have my $20 from Mr Maynard and my $60 from last week. I plan on depositing $30 of that in my savings. Gotta save for college! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffcc33>Whoa...My dad stopped over last night to pay my mom back for school pictures. Him and me still have plans to go to GLC for school clothes! I'm really excited for this weekend. Bowling Friday, Softball Saturday and Shopping Sunday! W00TNESS!</FONT></P>

Marie and I got ate up by mosquitoes when we were making smore's and watching the fire. Sleeping in the tent was fun. Putting it together was more fun because you had a strawberry BLONDE and a light brunette putting a tent together.lol In the morning we went to the blueberry festival and had breakfast then looked at the arts and crafts. There's a lot of hot guys out in Montrose! Whoa! Marie and I had rotating heads Sunday. lol Then I finally got ahold of Mallory and she came over last night. We watched Queen of the Damned and *melts* we LOOVVEE Lestat! Mal and I ended up going to bed around 2-2:30 then woke up to the phone. Mr Maynard called me and was wondering if I could babysit today at Randels. I went up there and watched his daughter from 8:30-noon. Then he told me that he had a chiropractic appointment and still needed me to watch the kids. I got to watch both his daughter, Hailey, and his couple month old son, Quinn. Quinn was a pre-mee and is soo tiny. Mr Maynard took us to his Mom and Dads. Wow! They live across from the golf course in Flushing and are in the country club. Need I say more? I'm glad I dressed kind of preppy today! Quinn was tired so I laid him down, woke up, ate, and repeat. Directions for Quinn Maynard: Feed, burp, nap, repeat. lol Later Hailey wanted some hot chocolate. No biggie until I made cheese from the milk. The microwave is 1200 watts! Damn! But I cleaned up the mess and made her some more. Right as I was, Mr Maynard pulled in to pick us up. *rode home* Once I got back home, I got ready for Orientation and put eye liner and mascara on. I looked really nice for my pictures. While I was trying to pluck my eye brows, everyone that I know started to call me. Oh my gosh! It was annoying! But we got there and it was a freakin' zoo! Then my schedule was messed up so I had to go to the office to fix it. Supposibly, Shawn is back to CA, again, and his hair is like a skaters...Creepy! Why won't he leave?! Damn, first Andrew and now Shawn. Wth?! Marie and I got lockers together and started planning stuff. Rayeann and I saw each other a couple times and we did our little retarted kid routine! lol Well, I got band AND I'm babysitting Robert tomorrow so peace out!

Once the other boy woke up, he took a bath and we went to the park. We got back, made lunch, and Robert made the most toxic ""love-package"" I ever smelled before in my life...Twice. I felt really bad because there wasn't enough baby-wipes to clean him off and I knew that had to be uncomfortable as hell. Robert started to get really hyper so he took his Ritalin.:D He was calm in 30mins to a hour. Went to Woodland, &nbsp;then Ethan was getting on my nerves once we got back. My headache from 2 o'clock still hasn't went away. I was soooo happy to be home and lay down and take a nap for a hour. Ever since I've been home,&nbsp;I've been chil-laxin'. But the two boys have a little kitten that reminds me of Sammy and I think we're going to get her!!!

<P><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp;Two weeks ago today, Chase came over, yeah I knew he liked me a lot but he brain washed me into thinking that if I didn't want to do anything, we wouldn't. All I wanted to do was chill, not cuddle cuddle kiss kiss like he planned. He comes into my house and gets a hug but goes to kiss me. I turn my head so he kisses my cheek. ""Oh, so you're not going to kiss me."" ""Nope..."" He then heads back into my room and sits on my head. Oookkay.He's talking away and I'm leaning against my wall, scared about what he might do. He scoots over so I can sit on my bed so I do; It's MY bed. He then picks me up and sits me on his lap, then lays me down and starts kissing my neck. I'm petrified so I can't really say anything. After a while, he puts me on-top of him and continues to kiss me while I refuse to kiss him. I sit up and walk around my room, ashamed of myself. He holds me and still kisses me. I feel like shit at this moment then he starts asking to give me head. I lost count how many times I said ""no"" sternly. Chase is the person that gets what and who he wants no matter what it takes. <EM>Some people don't understand that because they don't know how much of an asshole he is. </EM>After seeing the mark he gave me, and me breaking down; shaking and crying, he thinks it's best that he leaves. He won't leave without a kiss so I kiss him. Before hand I did kiss him and got a mouthful of tongue. XP Who likes that?! I certainly don't, Don't matter who ya are. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000>Yesterday Chase finally talks to me and says that he's sorry for leading me on and doesn't like me anymore. My consionce (whatever) is bothering me horribly becuase all while that above was happening, Louie's picture was looking right at me. I never enjoyed what was happening, I regret with every breath, and HATE MYSELF for it. I told Louie, he probably hates me forever. We're not boyfriend-girlfriend but he's been faithful to me and I wasn't to him. At least I didn't get raped by Chase which might've happened. Just to feed people egos and pride, I'll take full responsibility for not only my little actions, but all of Chase's that I had NO control over, no matter what I said. Louie accepted the fact that I told him but doesn't understand why I procrasinated; I wanted him to love me and spare him the hurt. Denise and I were comptemplating that last night. Maybe I shouldn't've told him and have it hurt him more. I love Louie, I would die so he wouldn't have to feel any un-happiness. I'd go on but I have band practice. Maybe that'll cheer me up. :\</FONT></P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#990000>Hey, I'm finally home and chil-laxin. This was my week although it might be a bit twisted because the days were a blur:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>Monday-</U> Got up early, went to the High School and left after a while. The bus ride was hilarious, smacking ourselves in the head with a brownie box, and goofing off. When we finally got to CMU, we had to wait in line FOREVER for our keys and luggage. Most of my friends and myself were on the 5th floor. My roomies and me mainly un-packed, made up our beds, got situated and headed for lunch. The food was HORRIBLE. Hot food was forbidden if you wanted to stay healthy. Ate, met outside at 12:30 and we just started basic blocks and our music. Dinner was at 4:30. That was too early for me but my room had tons of snacks in our cooler. That evening, we went to 7-11 and got slurppies! Yummy! At night, Vicky and I went streaking around in our underwear on our own floor. Dayna and Melissa tried getting me in the elevator and take me to the 1st floor; I broke their grip and went into my room. We didn't go to bed till 1-ish (after Syd and I flashed out the window. lol)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>Tuesday-</U> I was the first on up and immediatly got ready by 6:30. I doused myself with sunscreen and woke everyone up later. Did the whole breakfast, meeting, sectional marching thing. That night, after our practice, we did the trust walk. Andrew and his friends were pointing and laughing my way. I was hoping that he wouldn't pick me but Jamie from my softball team did. That day, I got terribly burned on my chest. I'm starting to peel. Thankfully Catherine, my one roomy, brought aloe stuff for burns. Nothing too exciting happened that night but I got to talk to Louie for a couple minutes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>Wednesday-</U> JUSTIN CAME TO CAMP!!! JUSTIN'S COMING BACK TO CA!!! Rayeann was the happiest I've ever seen her. Breakfast, marching, the normal once more. Blah! The only exciting that was happening was that I was getting tan, got a sore throat (still), and the band council bought pizza for the party. I was choosen to be ""initiated"". It was sooo much fun! Four other people and myself was chosen to copy cat our director with one of the color guards flags. What ever he said and did, we had to. The last time he sat down and we did, we sat on a cooolllddd wwweeettt towel. I had my new yellow central shorts on. XDD Afterwards, we just went up to our rooms and went to bed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>Thursday-</U> Typical stuff but we could not believe it was Thursday already. Dayna, Melissa, and Mallory I think went to the thrid floor and danced while I went out walking talking to Louie via cell phone. I think all 3 Culpepper boys were hitting on me with on of their friends. I was like ""Wth?! All of you have girlfriends!"" But not aloud. They made a pass about biting and me liking it. I yelled back, ""Yeah, that's why I'm passing up the offer."" They made some of the funniest cat-calls I've ever heard in my life!!! Sooo much fun. Earlier that day, it rained so we didn't really march till our evening practice. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>Friday-</U> Started packing so we didn't have to early this morning. That&nbsp;evening we got to practice in the CMU stadium. That was awesome! But I rolled my ankle messing around and Charles, Denise's crush, carried me back to our field. We then had the sectional Olympics with wheelbarrel races, cartwheels, running, and other things. Then the belching contest. It was a toss up between my section leader Jodi and Color-Guard leader Katie. I say Jodi won because Katie was showing off and being flashy while Jodi kept it real. That was the day we had our water ballon fight in the afternoon; where I barely got wet. We went back to our rooms and cleaned and packed. Dayna, Melissa and I had a party in our Common Room on our floor. The darn chaperons cut it early although they knew that we were&nbsp; having it. By then, I was just over-tired, over-whelmed, sun burned, worn out, that I broke down and cried. Thursday night and last night were the earliest nights I went to bed. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>Today was just a GINORMOUS blur. Woke up, showered, finished packing, ate very little becuase of my nerves which cause my blood sugar to go low later, and had a fire drill, hopefully. The fire drill made us almost 30 minutes late for our performance. The night before we got our black shirts for our uniforms. Great; black in 90* weather. I was soo nervous though. While we were warming up, I saw my mom and I was sooo happy. What was so great about our performance was that I didn't mess up or fall like I did Thursday and mermorized my music.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000><U>MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS-</U> Charles and Melissa kinda liked each other so Charles asked her out and she said no becuase she's not sure about her and her boyfriend and Mallory and I told her how much of a jerk Charles can be. There was this guy that looked like a giraffe and his name was Joey. lol Will that I liked last summer flirts with everybody including ME! lol Um, Andrew and I didn't really talk but Bri threw ice at him and he threw ice back at me...Interesting. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>Well, all for now!</FONT></P>

I was really bored... so I made that. XD It's supposed to be for another party I'm having this weekend. It's the Dearborn Homecomming - very fun! It's not a dance, no XD It's like a big fair thing... so I'm inviting people to chill at my place.

Is it me...or does nobody comment on this journal? Does anyone even read it? You would think people would.

I need a Wonka Bar right now. I got to pick out a nice industrial size box of candy for watching my crazy grandmother at Sam's Club. I was looking for a giant box of Wonka Bars... But there were none, so I picked out a biiiiiiiig box of nerds ropes. It's okay though, I bought out the gas station the past weekend. I got all their Wonka Bars.

Well - what is there to write about? I've been working on different articles on Wikipedia.org...

I know that Annie likes mermaids, so I was working on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid"">mermaid</a> article. You might want to take a look at ""In The News"", that's where most of my work is in that particular article.

Annie was telling me about her hair... she got it cut - (see below entry). I'm growing my hair out... It's getting difficult to spike my hair. It looks like chicago, with all the skyscrapers. Pretty soon I'll have terrorists flying remote controlled planes in my hair. 

I went and saw Willy Wonka twice at IMAX. Now, unfortunately...I have an unhealthy addiction to candy. XD My eating disorder has a disorder. I just have to be more careful of what I eat. The Wonka Bars are so delicious. Yum! ^_^;

My Homecoming one is blue with sparkles, zips and ties in the back. It makes me look like I have BOOBS! lol It's gorgeous! Then my possible Sadie's dress is very slimming, burgandy with embroderred flowers. It's formal, but not formal enough for me. lol Tomorrow morning Marie and me are going down to Great Lakes Crossing to get dresses. I didn't get paid yet for babysitting last week and this week but I hope I find something and Mom will take me back. My dream dress would be Rose's from Titanic. (burgandy with black) While Marie and I are down shopping, I'm hoping to get a tiara and maybe some gloves. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff99ff>I think I'm done babysitting the two little boys for the moment.

I went swimming in her lil pool that she isn't supposed to have, lol, and just chilled. I'm SOO happy to be home though. Once I got home I had to go to the dentist.

I somehow made him mad earlier and he was ""going to call his other girlfriends"", and call me once he was done...He must have a lot 'cause that was back around 8:10...It's after midnight. That made me cry that he doesn't trust me. I'm hoping to get some tarot cards tomorrow or soon so I can do that to find things about him. 
Justin is suspended for rest of the year, Shawn's coming back this week and Rayeann has been back for 2 weeks. This is what happened; Justin is a cutter so he brought his knife to school to cut himself for whenever he felt sad and depressed and need to ""punish himself."" Rayeann, Shawn, and me were worried for him but them two took the knife away from him. Rayeann was going to tell an adult but was scared to. Shawn on the other hand had a ""2.5"" inch blade, empty lighter and dress code violations. Then in science class 4 months ago we watched an explosion movie and Shawn shared his own notes with his friends. One of his friends' moms' saw and turned it into the Principal which got him out for 20-25 days. Rayeann was out for 10 because she had the knife and was going to tell somebody. Justin out for rest of the year because he started the whole thing and had another knife with him when the padded him down. Things are starting to get back to normal as posisble. Both of them have stopped cutting, thank God.
I'm playing softball agian. I lost my 1st position Center field to a fat-ass that doesn't know SHIT about the game. That pissed me off SOO bad at pracitce today. Ms. Holloway said that she would work with me at shortstop then maaaybe move me to 3rd. :D! Well, I talk to you later!

"event","Yea, so, this is the dealio!  
Shawn likes me. It's official. Orlando was buggin me in 2nd hour if I liked him earlier this week. I told him no but i always smiles cause it's a funny concept. 
Yesterday, I didn't play ""Pirates of the Carribean"" w/ Mark, Justin and Shawn. But Mr. Lewis did let me help conduct the 7th graders with Tara and Krissy. These two trombones were dancin and I couldn't stop laughin so I had to step down. But it was fun! :-D
Tonight my mom and I might go over to Marie's house fo a sleep-over with mom, her mom, Marie and myself. Hopefully, we'll go and stay up, eat popcorn, either make or order pizza, and rent movies. Sounds like sooo much fun.
Well, that's pretty much all of it..NO! Wait!!!
Band practice the other night went well. Saw Smelly. *pukes in corner* I ran out to the field and I lost my Fight Song. Thankfully a 7th grade flutie had an extra. And Tara and I have a song for Solo and Ensamble.

Right now there's this fat, old, blad guy I can't stand. He's my moms' friends' uncle. He tried brainwashed my mom on how ""aweful"" black jelly braclets are and that you HAVE to do what they mean. No matter how many times I shouted that I don't do that, the damn fat-ass wouldn't believed me but my mom did.

Well, all for now!

Cait <U>let me</U> look at her 7th grade yearbook. I&nbsp; guess there's some interesting pictures in there...*wink wink* Then we had the wonderful idea to watch all of the Trilogy and I, II Star Wars movies. Troy told us to watch the Trilogy first but we got super confused so we watched The Phantom Menace. We turned off the light and watched it. As I expected, we fell asleep. Woke up around 11 to Stephanie knocking on the door; ate breakfast and rewound (sp?) the movie. We were shocked on how much we feel asleep though. Then her dad got home so we got cleaned up. Wel..she did. I decided to wait till I got home to take a shower..(Which I haven't...I'm being lazy :P) </FONT></STRONG></P>

ABout 3-4 weeks ago I went with my cousin in his semi to Indy, Chicago, and around Michigan. It was cool staying up for 21 hours and getting 3 hours of sleep. *cough yeahright cough* 


Somehow, I kinda lost connection with my friends. This year is goin' pretty well; I'm kickin ass in Algebra and Science. My on/off ex before Andrew is back at CA. Shawn Goodall...wonderful. Everyone was like, ""Didya kno Shawns' back?!?!?"" I tolf them that he's in my first two hours...dumb fucks.
Yea. I'm in house 1, btw. 
Today went like this:
Band: Punched Liz, or ""Bri"", after she mentioned Andrews' name
S.S.: Juss really chilled and got at book from library
L.A.: Everyone liked my sandwhich for Wacky Sandwhich Day
Algebra: Almost beat the shit outta Ashley
Science: Did my work..NO HOMEWORK!!!
Office: It was soo slow...

That's been pretty much it...

<P>Past two days, I've been waking up after noon and with a sore throat. *Sarcsm* This is the perfect way to wake up on a weekend.&nbsp; It sucks really big balls.</P>

It was pretty awesome 'cause both of us got to talk to our grandparents. But there was this transvestdyke that kept talking to us and would not leave us alone. </FONT><FONT color=#33cc00>Earlier today we did it again and got into contact with this little 5 year old Jewish boy that died in WW2 in a Camp. That made us both sad. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>But the after that we took our showers' and went to Prime Outlets for awhile. We headed back and I started to get a headache and we got a snack once we got back home and took her doggy out for a walk around the block. Once we got back inside we played a game of Uno until my mom called and she came and picked me up.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT color=#33cc00>We went out to where she works and ate there. Since my headache was so bad, I could barely eat and I felt like I had to constantly throw up...I hate that feeling.

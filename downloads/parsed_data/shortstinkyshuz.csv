"event","Hey everyone!!! My birthday is coming very very soon!!! It is actually in only 2 days!!! Well I went to DAYTONA BEACH this past weekend and had a ton of fun! Although I had to go with my grandparents which was such a drag. I wish I could have taken a friend cause my mom was so boring she didn't even get in the beach and all the excitement happens at night but ofcourse they were all to tired to go out at night! I needed to go with someone like my cousin that way she would be old enough to party but not so old I couldn't tag along!! Well hopefully everyone else is doing good...I think Katie and Amanda are out of town for a while and so for that I think my birthday party won't be untill school starts that way in so EVERYONE can come!!! Oh and if you have any ideas on a theme let me know cause I'm fresh out! Talk to yall' later!"

"event","Hey everyone, well if you have been wanting to talk to me this summer I think everyone is out of luck :-( From the past Wednesday untill yesterday I had been spending the night at the barn and riding my horse everyday to get ready for a show on Saturday...Well I'm home now untill tomorrow night and then I go back to be counsler for Horse Camp and I've heard that this week is full of a bunch of little brats..oh goody I feel so privaledged!!! Well I'll be there for the next two weeks and then I'm going to my own camp in the middle of the Ocala Forest so say goodbye to me, I might get eaten by a bear! So anyway I try to keep my cell on all the time but then I just relized that unless I catch you while your calling I can't call back cause my stuupid phone won't call out up there! Well enough with my complaning I forgot to tell you all what happened the day I was leaving to go up there, which was Tuesday night. Well John called me!!! So I talked to him for a while and then he called back later so I talked to him twice now!! But I think I might get to go hunting with sometime this summer if I'm not off at camps all the time, LOL!!! Well it was really cool talking to him and I think we have a lot of things in common but probably not everyone agrees with that cause we do have a lot of things not in common too. Well it's getting kinda late and the Lightning just won the Stanley Cup so my parents might want to gewt to bed and I wouldn't want to bother them...but I'll be home, bored tomorrow...Give me a call if you want to...I get lonely too!!! Oh and our dryer broke, LOL it was an antique anyway but we have to wash our clothes at my grandmas now...and I think it's halarious! I really don't mind now my clothes smell Tide fresh and when they come home I feel like just going to sleep in them! Well talk to you all later!"

"event","Hello everybody! Well today was an excellant day! I spent the entire day in Miss Moss' class with Taryn! She is a really cool person and I think everybody loves her! Well guess who was also there all day...JOHN!!! Yeah and well I know I was suppose to say something to him today...but I JUST COULDN'T! I feel so bad about it to cause I really liked him and I should have just been brave and asked him. EERRRRRR!!! Oh Taryn also asked him if he liked me and he said yes. ERRR!!! Well since I wasn't going to ask him somewhere I figured I should give him my phone number, ok well Taryn thought I should have, so I wrote it on a piece of paper and well I JUST COULDN'T DO IT AGAIN. So Stephanie gave it to him and well he probably won't call me EVER...I am such a stupid person!!! Well then he was looking at me all the way to the bus cause that's where we were headed BUT then he ended up on the side of the school we were walking on and I don't know why he was over there but I've been thinking and there is a trash can over there...so was he throwing away my number or was he just walking over there...hmmm...now I want to go investigate...throw Amanda C. in the trash and have her look around for me! No not really but thats a funny picture! But anyway...I'm just a big fat chicken!!---Tomorrow I might be going to Adventure Island with Taryn...if my mom says yes and Taryn gets me a pass! It will be a ton of fun!!! Oh hey tell me if you like my new background!! I NEED COMMENTS!"

"event","Hey everyone, Today was so much fun!!! My hall(engineering) had a field day type thing where we all went outside for almost the whole day! It was actually pretty boring but I hung out with Taryn and it was a lot of fun! Then sometime in 3rd period we met this dude Thomas, who by the way is really hot and I think likes Taryn, and we all hung out! Oh then we met up with Shannon, who is also really cool! Well we played in the hose getting all wet, but it was a ton of fun! Ha and Thomas dunmped water on Amanda, who we thought would have a fit but it was actually Brittany who had the fit! Then Taryn and I went to French class for 5th period cause they were sending us to class soon anyway! Well in french the kisd put in this movie, I don't remember the name, and we saw a PENIS! It was SOOOO ugly! AHHHH and Madame tried to cover it and her dress flew up!!!LOL!!! Well then we went to 6th and I went with Taryn to Ms. Moss' class! And by the way John was there and I TALKED TO HIM!!!!! Yeah so I'm glad I did...Ms.Moss kinda started the conversation and when we stopped talking he went to another table and she said that I should have kept the convo goingbut I ran out of things to say but she would be proud of me cause I talked to him after school on my way to the bus! Well he left in front of the media but still we talked for a little while! Well Taryn and I might be going to the beach tomorrow with Thomas! He is supposed to be bringing his car tomorrow and we are going to skip school! But it's not as it would matter anyway cause they arn't counting attendance! I am kinda have thoughta about not going....I kinda want to just spend the day with Ms. Moss or something!! Then maybe on Wednesday go to the beach!! That would be cooler! That way I'm not all bored on Wed.!!! Oh well!!!......OMG I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE BUS!!!!! KEVIN AND JAMES KISSED! Amanda and I told them that if they kissed then we would flash them and make out with them....well we didn't think they would actually do it but they did! It was sooooo GROSS!!!! Well anyway Ill just leave you with that thought!Oh and we weren't going to going to flash them or make out with them but I was sincerly shocked that they did it...man what guys will do for a little action!<marquee>CYALL LATER!!!!</marquee>"

"event","&nbsp;So...how is everyone today? I am peachy! Today was very fun! Block shedual again and it was very fun...let's see had 1st, 2nd, 6th, and then 4th but I went to Ms. Moss' room! Ms.Moss is absolutly the best teacher ever(and I'm not just saying that because she might read this)!!! Well at school there's this guy named John who I always notice looking at me. It's not really like a stalking look but more like I'm absolutly in love with you look! Well yesterday Taryn and I went into her class when he was in there and all he was doing was looking at me. He looks at me at lunch and whenever I see him in the hall. Well he's in one of Ms. Moss' classes so I told her and she said that he's really sweet, and I will always believe Ms.Moss! So I asked her why he doesn't just tell me he likes me and she said that he's shy...awwwww!!!! Well anyway she was going to ask him if he liked me today but he wasn't here. Well then when I went into her class for 4th period she said that out loud and one of his friends are in there and he heard her say ""oh he said he was going hog hunting today"" and he looked right at me, so I hope he doesn't tell John I was talking about him. And well I kinda like him even though I know everyone who comments is going to say 'eeeeillll' but I don't really care I'm fed up with the good looking jerks I don't mind liking someone who is just really sweet!<BR>So secretly I want to go out with him and thats why I don't make a big deal when Brittany wants to tell him off, cause I wouldn't want her to do that!&nbsp; ERRRRRR I probably need to just tell him I like him but I don't have guts like that and I am probably trying to hook up with someone at the wrong time of year HA yeah 2 days of school left that great timing!! Oh well maybe Ms.Moss can work some of her firefighter magic!!!"

"event","<P>Hi to everyone again!! This is an extention of what happened yesterday but it's not an extension I'm just telling you what happened today, if that made any sense!?! Well this morning the question was asked...but let me start from the beginning...I got on the bus this morning with no problems, just starring out the window like I usally do! Well then the bus ride was normal as always got to school and get off and there's James waiting outside the bus and he says to me, ""Kevin wants me to ask you if you'll go out with him?"" Well earlier kevin was being mean so Amanda says that that will be our excuse, so I kinda looked down and mumbled a no and then Amanda blurts out ""He's to mean for her!!"" .... that was this morning!!! Then this afternoon he wouldn't really look at me and I asked Amanda if he said anything to her and she said no but he looked sad. Well anyway I felt really bad so I'm NOT going out with him, I'm just going to see a movie. I know it's horrible and some probably think I'm leading him on...but I'm not. I told him it was just friends and he's bring James and I'm dragging Amanda so it will be friends...But I still feel bad cause I'm not attracted to him in any way but he is to me. I just don't wanna hurt him so figured this would be a good way to kinda wean him off of me!!! </P>
<P>Well now during my day.... Today was awesome!!!!! We had block schedual and I love it so much! Had a really hard test in 2nd(which was 1st) but I got through it with only one question wrong!! WHoo-hoo GO ME!!!! Then I had 3rd period, where we watched thelast part of Romeo and Juliet! It's a good flick, but I liked yesterday better where we got to see the BUTT!!! Don't tell anyone this but it was a nice butt!!! Well then we just went over the movie and what would be on our exam tomorrow! OH then we wrote a letter of appreciation since it's teacher appreciation week! I wrote mine to Miss Moss! Then I went to lunch then 5th and then 6th where I had to show how to perform CPR (it was a test) well don't ever die near me.&nbsp;I skrewed everything up. Luckily she let me do it over again and I got a 90%. So that's good! Well I think I've written enough and I've taken you up to this very moment in my life so....<marquee>Austa la Vista Darlin'</marquee>"

"event","Hey everyone! Today was pretty fun! Well untill I got on the bus this morning! OK i get on and the two kids that sit in the seat across from me, James and Kevin, and well kaevin goes ""Hi Sam"", with an emphasis on the Sam! So I was just sitting in my seat and then James, who is sitting on the edge, turns to Kevin and I hear him say, ""Are you gonna ask her today?"" So I figured he was talking about asking me out because my frind Amanda who sits with me but doesn't get on till the last stop said that he liked me a few days ago. So then when she got on I asked her and she said that yesterday when I didn't ride the bus Kevin asked her where I was because he was going to ask me out. Well he didn't ask me out in the morning so I was wondering if he would this afternoon and the whole day wondering what to say to him when he did ask me out. You might be wondering why this is...well because he is a really great guy...great personality...really sweet...but I love him as a friend and I don't find him attractive that way. If I was to go out with him then things could never be the same on the bus...and well the bus is where I can act totally stupid and nobody will ever care!! Well he didn't ask me out today morning or afternoon but I used to kid with him and I was doing the same today and well Amanda said I was flirting :(...so thing will never be the same because now everythings different...errr why do middle schoolers like me and not high schoolers? This world is messed up and I want out!"

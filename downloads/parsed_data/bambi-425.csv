"event","i decided journal writing isn't necessarily my thing...i feel weird writing down all my thoughts that are running through my head all day to begin with.  plus in retrospect...i don't know who all is actually reading this...that i know anyway.  i know amanda does but girl i tell you everything you want to know about my life anyway.  and things i don't think you want to know lol.  but that's part of having a best friend right?  right.  but yeah.  i just feel so damn weird.  i can't keep up with a regular journal so i don't know what made me think i could keep up with this thing...i love to read everyone else's and more power to you for writing but i feel weird spilling my guts to anyone...but amanda.  yeah that's pretty much the only person i feel like i can tell ANYTHING to and know that she won't ever judge me or try to change me or tell me to shut up lol.  the last one happens sometimes but it's all in fun lol.  i hope i see you again soon.  i want to know how trishia's wedding was.  and i HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO tell you how the wedding i went to was.  you will DIE WHEN YOU HEAR IT!  we MUST get together soon.  anyway...i just got home from work and yes it's 2:30 in the morning and i may go to six flags tomorrow with a friend from work so i need to make an attempt at sleep....after i watch a movie lol.  and get a drink cuz i'm thirsty.  hey maybe i'll make a new name only for amanda like you did for me lol.  then i can spill things and not be afraid anyone else i know will read it.  or we can just talk i guess lol.  that's always a good time.  especially when mom comes in too lol.  i love her face when we talk about stuff sometimes lol it's wonderful.  tell her i love her.  and i love you too.  i must depart.  i want to lay down.

"event","ok....well i'm updating because i'm sure amanda is going to kick my ass soon if i don't.  but it's ok i know she loves me!  heehee!  anyway.  i'm pretty lonely cuz he's out of town with a couple friends camping and riding four wheelersfor memorial weekend and all that jazz...so i'm bored out of my mind.  all i have is my work (which for those of you who don't know yet i'm at blockbuster now too...) and i have mom n dad which aren't so exciting as much as i love them...and i have becky.  which she's always fun but she works too so it's hard to actually find time to hang out and actually do fun stuff.  but yeah.  OO i had this guy come in today with a couple friends and he made me sooo happy!!!  i was bored off my ass and he came in and asked me to help him pick out some scary movies!!!  he was soooo cute too.  and after like a half hour later he was finished and shook my hand and said it was nice meeting you and all that cute stuff.  i was excited lol.  he had a sexy lip ring and beautiful BLUE eyes....lol you know me amanda....only blue lol.  
but yeah that was the highlight of my whole weekend pretty much.  OH YEAH....for amanda again:  i'm off wednesday and thursday so if you would like to do the thing wednesday night i can help you clean during the day and that way you don't have to do it by yourself and plus you'll be in my company all day long lol.  which is always fantastic i know i know lol.  but i don't want you to have to do it by yourself.  but i also have dance wednesday night so at some point i'll have to take a break to do that from cleaning....it's 6:30-7:30.  so i won't waste the fun or anything.  i'll be back at your house by 8 or so unless becky wants me to go eat with her which is always a thought cuz i dunno what she'll wanna do.  she buys so she can drag me wherever she wants lol.  FREE FOOD!  can't turn that down either....it's almost as bad as sex LMAO no i'm kidding.  ok maybe just kidding a little lol.  no no joke.  lol.  anywho.  so let me know if that's good for you.  i'll be online for awhile tonite so hopefuly you'll get on at some point and then we can just talk about it so i'm not talking to myself here lol.  as much as everyone enjoys my conversations with myself.  
i'm not afraid of anything 
i just need to know that i can breathe, and i don't need much of anything 
but suddenly suddenly... 
i am small and the world is big
all around me is fast moving, surrounded by so many things 
suddenly suddenly... 
how does it feel to be different from me? 
are we the same, how does it feel to be 
different from me? are we the same how does it feel... 
i am young and i am free, 
but i get tired and i get weak 
i get lost and i can't sleep. 
how does it feel to be different from me? 
are we the same, how does it feel to be 
different from me? are we the same, how does it feel...   
would you come find me? 
would you cry with me? 
i am small and the world is big...but i'm not afraid of anything.

avril is my idol.....love all.

"event","i often wonder when this will end.  how long can it really go on?  all i'm asking for is his love.  he has all mine.  i have never loved someone so much in my life...other that family or amanda or something.  it's sooo hard.  i know that on some level the fact that i am sitting here waiting for something that may never happen...is ridiculous.  but i can't make myself let go of him.  he is who i want.  i know there are other 'better people' out there...and by that i mean someone who will take me out to eat and to movies and always drive everywhere we go.  and do everything that i want to do and completely disregard his own feelings....but when it comes down to it...who wants that?  i want someone that has their own beliefs and morals.  and hopefully the majority of them match but life and love aren't perfect.  i just want happiness.  i want him to finally give up the shit and come back to me.  and just me.  i think i'm worth that.  i've had so many different guys want to be with me and i know that they are good people and will treat me 'better' but i want him...i completely turn these other dating prospects down because i want him.  i want him to be with me.  i want him to WANT to be with me.  i want to make him happy for the rest of my life.  and i want him to make me happy the rest of my life.  i just don't think that's so much to ask.  i'm supportive of near everything he does.  some things are crazy...but i just want him to be ok...i don't want to lose him.  but i fear that i will.  and then what.  i will have lost the one that i have wanted for almost 4 years.  i don't believe in love at first site per say...but i definitely fell in love with him when we met.  after we talked...and he hugged me...and asked me if he could call me sometime.  i wanted to melt into him right there.  and i did.  and now it's like he's melting AWAY.  and it hurts so bad.  i would do anything for him.  i would probably die for him...or come damn close lol.  and by die for him i mean that if he were in danger and i could keep him from dying by putting myself on the line...i would do it without hesitation...and i want to believe he would still do the same.  i just want to stop crying myself to sleep wondering where he is and what he's doing when he doesn't answer his phone...and when i page him and he doesn't call back.  i can't help but think he's with someone else...and i dread that thought.   but it keeps me awake at nite.  it keeps me from sleeping...it distracts me during the day...it controls my mind.  HE controls my mind...and i can't stop it.  and i don't want it to stop...because when it stops....then something has happened...i don't know exactly what...but something...and i like the something that is there now...i don't want a new something.  if that makes sense to anyone else...it makes sense to me.  anyway.
i'm sorry sister.  i left you a comment so there isn't much else for me to tell you.  i just know that you WILL be happy with someone else someday whether you think so or not.  you've found love more than once so there's nothing stopping it from happening again.  except you.  and i wouldn't block out such a wonderful feeling.  that's my advice for you.  but anyway...it's really late and i work in the morning...so i've spilled my beans if you will...and i must be off...love love."

"event","i am soooo stupid.  i can't stop crying and it's my fault this time.  not all of it...the reason i'm crying isn't entirely my fault. anyway.  so i'm at his house...he gets in the shower and me, being the ignorant snoop that i am, look thru the text msgs on his phone.  i find one that definitely clarifies that he has had sex with this girl.  so of course i flip out and lock myself in his mom's room until he gets out of the shower because i'm trying not to kill myself with sadness. so he finally gets out in what seems like an eternity later i guess because of all the thoughts racing thru my mind like somebody on crack or something.  so he tries to open the door and he can't so obviously he bangs on it but then goes and sits in the living room. i come out with a tear stained face and i can't look at him because i want to die.  he keeps asking what the hell is wrong with me and at this point he's getting pissed because he knows i've snooped on something to be this upset out of nowhere...so i just bluntly say i dunno why don't you go f*ck amanda agn...(her name).  and he's like omg i don't have time for this because by now he DEFINITELY knows where i got it from...he proceeds to say that it was a really long time ago; but he never told me....that was why i was soooo upset.  he didn't think he could tell me.  i told him the other day...we had a conversation about this.  i said if you're going to date other girls i don't care because that's what you want to do.  but don't lie to me about it and just tell me no i'm not dating anyone else.  because then when i find out about these other girls and how he has most certainly slept with one or who knows probably more now since he didn't tell me about this one.  i just want him to be honest with me...you know how much i love him and that's why i want to die right now. i snooped and then didn't think before i spoke...i should have just asked when they had sex...and not gotten all irrational.  but you know me...i'm all fucked up.  
i seriously don't know what to do....i know i can trust him....it's just so hard to BELIEVE him when i find this kind of stuff out...and when he says 'a long time ago' i don't know if that means right after we 'broke up' or whatever or if a long time ago to him is while we were still together or if it was 3 months ago ya know?  omg amanda what do i do.....i've been crying for 45 minutes straight...i don't think i've ever cried this long except for when i had to put pepper to sleep.......i have to call him but i don't know what to say...he's ssooo mad at me.  i'm just sad...i'm not even mad anymore...that was just the initial feeling....now i just want to crawl in a hole and die....i actually thought about letting a car crash into me on the way home from his house...that's how depressed i am right now....i mean i really did.  i actually wanted it to.  but then what...if i died he wouldn't even know about it til like a day or so from now i bet.  unless my mom happened to call to tell him.  which i think she'd be a little too upset to do that....but hell if i know.  i hate myself....i haven't been this upset with myself in...ever i think.  i'm sooo stupid.  what the hell was i thinking....i really am dad...."

OH guess what?  my buddy jeff...(wynn from high school if you remember him..) is gunna get me a job at blockbuster with him.  i am super excited about it too.  you know how poor i am....well i jsut gave dad my insurance money so now i'm in the hole again.  but i hope i get this job with him...that will be so good for me.  and i get like 5 free rentals a week or something like that...it's cool..i don't even rent movies and it's cool lol.  but i think i'd like the job.  so i'm excited.  i'm going to meet his manager this wednesday...so cross your fingers for me...but i'm outta here cuz i'm talkin to you anyway...

i'm sorry about your monkey...why is he leaving...is he going back on the farm or something?  he mentioned something about needing money and blahblahblah but i didn't know he was actually going to go down there again.  but you'll be ok sister.  i am here and i will keep you company.  and it would probably do you justice to just call me every once in awhile.  i don't know why you don't and i would call YOU but every time i do no one answers the phone...so i gave up with that.  but seriously you can call whenever you want.  it's no big deal.  and i know you have my cell phone number somewhere.  it's on all day and all nite.  call anytime you want to talk about anything.  oh and i drove by where trishias moms is so i know where it is now.  i thought that's where it was but now i know for sure cuz i looked for it last nite on the way to daniels.  i might go there tonite after my horrible dentists appt which i'm sooooo not looking forward to but hey my teeth are gunna start fallin out soon if i don't go ya know it?  lol.  ok well i'm outta here cuz i've been at this computer forever and i want to go now lol.  love you sister."

my cat is licking my arm...i dont see what is so great about it. but she does it every time im on this computer...i must taste good or something lol.  thats dirty..yuck.  
but anywho...im cleaning...how do you like that?  i NEVER clean anymore.  unless its not my room which doesnt make sense because i LOVE when my room is clean i just hate getting it clean ya know?  its soooo repetitive...pick things up...stash them somewhere...throw this away.  stack that...dust that.  ugh.  im a pack rat so i find it hard to actually throw things away really.  but im trying pretty hard right now.  my closet is really whats killing me.  i have no room in there to throw the things i want to stash so i have to find somewhere else to put it and then i forget where that place is.  cuz before i just knew it was somewhere in my closet but now i have so much clothes that i dont know where to put anything anymore.  its horrible lol.  i need to give some of my clothes to goodwill or something.  theyre nice clothes i just dont wear them anymore.  i wear things twice and then never again unless i really like it.  i should fix that right? lol.  im too poor to buy any more new clothes anyway so i should just start wearing everything again.  
heres some news.  ive decided to be a vegetarian.  how cool is that?  well see if i can actually do it.  its been 3 days now since ive eaten meat.  and i havent really even thought about it so i think ill be ok lol.  but ill sure be proud of myself if i can make for some extended amount of time like a month or more ya know?  that would be raelly cool...ill finally have proof of my self-control.  i dont have much of it i know that.  well i guess it depends what its about.  men?  no self-control.  a little...if i really dont like them...lol.  but the one that i love?  absolutely NO self-control.  i will do ANYTHING for him.  its sad really.  but i think youre supposed to want to do anything for the one you love...i wish he would do anything for me.  i should find some secret way to test that.  cuz he really does do just about everything i want him to. except for when i say hey id appreciate it if you quit this whole 'lets date other people' phase youre going through because my heart is being stomped and spit on every time i see you.  every time i smell you.  every time i hear your voice.  its sooo painful...but icant let go of him.  i love him too much.  and i find it too painful to even tell him how i feel so this has been going on for a long time.  i need help.  i know he loves me.  he wouldnt say it if he didnt because thats just who he is.  he doesnt even tell his mom he loves her and i know he does obviously.  but he tells me because he does love me.   Does that make sense to anyone?  it makes perfect sense to me but i guess thats just in my head.  but hes taking me on a 'date' if you will this thursday.  were gunna go see a movie.  im pretty excited.  i never get to go to movies anymore cuz im so broke lol.  i would marry him if he asked me....i really would.  i have never loved someone and trusted someone as much as i love and trust him.  no matter how upset i am he mends my pain and hurt just by rocking me in his arms...how is it that the scent of him makes me hurt...but the only way ill feel better is to be in his arms?  if someone can explain this phenomena to me id be really appreciative.  i mean really.  how does that work.  ok off this subject.  actually i think ill go back to cleaning and blasting my music and dancing and singing to myself lol.  amanda likes that dontcha?  lol.  i know you do.  love love.  until next time."

"event","well amanda pretty much called me a hypocrit for not updating my journal and telling her to update hers so i guess ill satisfy her and write in this doobop.  so i worked the night shift last nite and i closed this morning at work and total i made $130 so i was SUPER DOOPER proud of that business lol.  i need that money bad since my DAMNED car keeps BREAKING.  i hate cars.  they are the biggest money suckers ever.  besides insurance and things like that i guess.  but yeah ive had this massive headache all day and im pretty sure im ready for it to go away now.  its welcome is officially worn out.  and amanda says she has a headache today too which just proves what weve been telling people all along....we share a brain!  so HAHA!!!  we were right and you were wrong.  
i need a second job...which i really dont want to do but i need the money...so i got this email from sears earlier today and im going to go ahead and apply for it even though i think its a geek job...lol.  no its just some kind of computer kinda job from what i gathered about the job summary thing...it wasnt very clear.  it just said that i must have good typing skills which i like to think that i do most of the time...and good math skills...which i lack but maybe if i wear a low-cut shirt theyll still hire me!!  pfff no jk.  thats ridiculous.  so ill apply.  and i put my application in at garden ridge which i dont really want but like i said...i need money.  and theyre hiring so hopefully they will call me if not i will go in my low-cut shirt and beg lol.  ha jk again.  im a joker.  and a retard lol.  
i wonder if theres a limit to how long your journal entry can be?  not that i would sit here and try to figure it out or anything but i was just thinking.  im really not liking the music thats playing today.  i havent caught any good songs on the radio at all...they had good music at work...but thats not unusual theres always good music there.  but everytime i got in the car it was just complete crap!  i mean really...i think the radio people just have a big HUGE thing of buttons for all the songs they have and they randomly select a button with their eyes closed and pick from the ""beth hates these songs"" section.  
anywho...at work...this guy..me and him have gotten pretty close.  not weird close cuz hes married.  but im pretty sure he thinks that since weve gotten this close that he can be all touchy around me...i dont know what im talking about.  but anyway...i think when we were drinking we may have made out but i really dont remember that nite at all nor do i remember how i got home...which isnt good because i know i drove cuz my car was at my house...lol...and i was in my pjs and stuff and all in my bed and comfy when i woke up in the morning...so its not like i woke up in a ditch or anything.  but i have a vague vision of us making out for some reason and i dont think my mind would just come up with that for no reason ya know?  i dont really want to ask him because im sure hed lie about it lol.  he IS a man after all.  he doesnt want to get in trouble and im sure he figures if i dont remember on my own then why should he tell me?  it makes sense i see what hes thinking...i probably wouldnt tell a girl that either....we were both roasted.  it doesnt matter.  just needed to get that out to somebody cuz i didnt know who to tell that to exactly....this journal is pretty much for amanda cuz as far as i know shes the only one thats ever read it lol.  so i hope youre enjoying this fun story amanda!  
ok i quit for today...before i tell my life story. lol.  bye for now."

"event","alrite so the going to illinois thing was a BAD idea cuz my car is being really jewish right now...sorry if u read this and youre jewish.  but anywho....so my battery light comes on in my car...and right before that i felt it pull back a little....and im on the highway by the way.  so the light comes on...then my steering wheel locks up!!!  i had to like put ALLLLL my weight onto it to turn....at this point im just seeing that im going to die or something.  i wanted to have a heart attack.  but thank goodness i made it home pretty much in tears....it was really scary.  but im alive and phil is going to come check my fluids and my battery and alternator tomorrow nite to make sure its not tooooo badly screwed up which i hope it isnt because i do NOT have the money to fix it.  my job SUCKS!!!  i get no hours henceforth making nooo money.   which is not helpful.  and i got a WHOPPING $3 back from my taxes which is friggin ridiculous.  i dont even want to go there.  i DO however wish this launchcast thing would play a song i like."

"event","so i guess this is supposed to be easier than writing in a real journal.  i hope to find that this philosophy is true.  if it isn't then oh well.  its not like i kept up with the real journal anyway.  so....i just got done taking a test in my psychology test which i hope i did OK on.  but what does hoping get you? jack shit.  it sure doesnt get me anywhere like EVER.  i prefer to wish not hope.  wishing requires some form or action whereas hoping is just something u do in your subconscious that cant possibly result in anything but frustration. anyway.  im off.  im going to illinois to hang out with my friend Josh."

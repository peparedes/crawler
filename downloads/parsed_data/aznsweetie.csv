1) missed out on a day field trip because i'm a procrastinator

3) HERE'S THE KICKER: ACTUALLY HAVE TIME TODAY TO DO IT...AND GUESS WHAT....FORGOT THOSE DAM* AMP METERS @ SCHOOL!!!! OH YES...I TRULLY HAVE HIT ROCK BOTTOM...BUT FIGURED OUT THERE'S MORE BOTTOM 
4) have a play practice 2morrow...@ 4...where i have 2 do the titration experiment...THE GROUP 4 PROJECT....vocab...ch.23 notes for history...GROUP 4 LAB REPORT....titration lab report....GROUP 4 EXPERIMENT!!!!!!!!!

Great, finals are on tuesday...i have detention on monday....last gymnasics meet is this week...i looked in my planner and it said that it would be on this thursday so that's good to know...cause it won't interfer with the studying i'll try to do for finals...anywho...every sentence has the word final in it..how sad...i'll stop...or try at least...SOMETHING HAPPY...i can do beam now for gymnastics...for our last meet...i cried...got in trouble for that too but that's not the point...i feel so useless being on the team...i'm the worst one on there...and i don't even do good for the one event that i can do..floor...with that attitude...i really worked hard the next practice...and now i can do beam...it may seem really easy to just balance on the beam for some of you...but it's not...you have to do jumps and it still hurts us girls if you land between your legs...i haven't done that yet...but i KNOW for a fact it will hurt but i don't tend to find out how much it would hurt...he ehee...so right now i can do floor...i gotta practice that more...do better than a 5.5! And if the coaches let me do beam i wonder if i can stick it...that means not fall off and land all your jumps for those of you who don't know about gymnastics...hee hee...by me able to do beam...i can feel like i can do vault as well...i mean IN PRACTICE..i am really weird with vault...i can't do it in practice no matter what...but the funny thing is that i can do it when i have to in the meet....the weirdest thing....i don't know what it is about the pressure...the real pressure that is and the judge just being there staring at me as she lifts her arm up to signal me that i can start...and i salute her back...and the thoughts that i think about when i run towards the board and just strattle...it's the weirdest thing...people all can do it except me of course...i dunno...i'm wack....it's my left leg that don't cooperate really but it does now for beam...cause i have to jump up with both legs and land on the beam as my mount...anywho...when matt came down from the stands and asked me what's wrong...i thought you didn't care about this at all...at first i completely didn't care about this...but i've been doing this for months and things become important after that long...esp. after i found out that i could've letter...but now i know it's immpossible...but knowing me i have that voice inside me telling me that i might have that 3% chance of lettering and i try to work harder and not be so scared about gymnastics....but when i don't letter...i know i'll cry...it's so me...when i tell myself those lies and get my hopes all high...then i get shot down...i cry...i just do...it's such a bad habit...well that's way enough for me today...maybe i'll take a nap then i'll study...hee hee...good luck to everyone that has finals....study hard...i should be taking my own advice right now...but i don't work that way!!!"

"event","yeah this weekend i went to a my friend michelles birthday party. it was fun i had a good time. but like usuall something wrong had to happen. see there is this girl named lauren and everytime there is a party something happens. this time it was bad. see what happened was her and a friends wanted to get ""fucked"" up. so they met to complete strangers and were going to go to there house later. well michelle's sister's found out what they were doing. well not only did they get in trouble because it was strangers but because they were two 26 year old men. so they ended up having to go home.so after that the party was fun. then when i got home i got blonde highlights! well that was my exciting weekend.heheh

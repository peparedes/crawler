"event","god i dont even know why i try and have fun anymore. all i get is letdown and bad experiences. nothing ever works out EVER. my sisters bought tickets so we could all go to the jason mraz tonight but in the middle of the night some dumb fucking tard ass slashed my sisters tires on her car. real fucking nice.now yet again i dont get to go to a show that i had my heart tset on. thanks for crushing my fucking dreams midnight dream slasher.
another thing i dont know is why i bother with aimless relationship hopes.i like people who i have no chance with even though they have all the qualities and interests i look for in someone. why bother hoping when a midnight dream slasher in desguise of an extacy popping partenr will swoop in when im ofcourse alone in my room with only the company of a book thats just as depressed and full of angst as i am.....fukit

isnt fate cute just taunting me trying to piss me off..eat a dick and die fate i hate you and your mom...fuck off"

the news:
A billion people died on the news tonight 
But not so many cried at the terrible sight 
Well mama said 
It's just make believe 
You can't believe everything you see 
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies 
On the news tonight 

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright 
To put the music behind the news tonight 
Well mama said 
You can't believe everything you hear 
The diagetic world is so unclear 
So baby close your ears 
On the news tonight 
On the news tonight 

The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight 
And mama said 
Mmm 

Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die 
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes 
Mama said 
It's just make believe 
You cant believe everything you see 
So baby close your eyes to the lullabies 
On the news tonight"

"event","Hey Kurtis, Im awake its 2:09 i wanna call u but i dont wanna bug u. I hope u had a good time with your new life (ppl) at the mall and movies and stuff. I did nothing really. But umm well just incase  your wondering how im doing here u go (nothing bad ).
I can't meet 
I can not help im Losing sleep over this No I can't And now I cannot stop pacing Give me a few hours I'll have this all sorted out... If my mind would just stop racing Cause I cannot stand still I cant be this unsturdy This cannot be happening This is over my head But underneath my feet Cause by tomoroow morning I'll have this thing beat And everything will be back to the way that it was I wish that it was just that easy Cause I'm waiting for tonight Been waiting for tomoroow I'm somewhere in between What i thought was real was just a dream Would you catch me if I fall, out of what I fell in? Dont be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again !I don't want to run away from this.I know that I just don't need this Cause I cannot stand still I cant be this unsturdy 
This cannot be happening (I thought what we had meant something)
Cause I'm waiting for tonight 
Been waiting for tomorrow 
And I'm somewhere in between .....

 
I wish u could find me here and speak to me I want to feel you again like i use 2, I need to hear you so i know that i am ok. Kurtis u were the light that lead me to the place where i found peace.You are the strength that keeps me walking. You were the hope that kept me trusting....You are the life to my soul.You are my purpose, Kurtis u are everything to me.... And how can i stand here with you and not be moved by you? Would u tell me how could it be any better than this?!?!? You calmed the storms you gave me rest,U held me in your hands, i wish you wouldnt let me fall.You still my heart and take my breath away.Would u ever take me in again would you take it deeper than u ever had before? Because your all i want, your all i need, you are everything .

Kurtis, I cant sit here and act like i dont care for you anymore. I dont know what the hell is wrong with me? I dont know what to do. You would think id hate you for cheating on me with 3 diffrent girls and fucking one of the 3. But im not, Its weird i cant be mad at you for somereason no matter how hard i try( but i do know it hurts really bad inside and ive got 10million diffrent thoughts going on in my head). I cant take this feeling anymore its way out of touch, what the hell is the meaning to this? It means way to much.I dont know why i cant get over the fact that u dont care about me anymore. Its just theres this thing going on in my head telling me to hold on and not to let go of u. But ive got to you wanna move on obviously. But i wish you werent. You know my summer sucked ass. I spent the whole summer thinking of you and wonderind what u were  doing and hoping and praying every night that everything in my life will somehow  fall into place.I wanted u back (i didnt get it) i wanted to be with you ( i didnt get the chance) I wanted to be your girl again (only in my dreams).I cant get over you Kurtis, THIS SCARES ME! Kurt you know im not thee kinda person to bring myslef down, or smoke or drink everytime i have the chance to. U KNOW THAT. Kurtis ahhhh god I hate myslef right now, I wanna die just so i can be happy (so you can be happy) I wont be the girl u call a crazy bitch who needs to get over it.I will be out of your life i wont ever have to bug you again. I know you hate it... But Kurt this is the only way i can ever talk to you, u wont ever come see us anymore. I never knew someone could change soo damn much. But i guess now i know it can happen?!? "" Gosh i really hope you are reading all of this"". Its 3 in the morning. I just wish i could be the girl u wanted ""oh god what i would do to be in that girls spot"". ""there is snot and tears all over my keyboard lol"".... Kurtis i dont know if im ever gonna get you back again.That scares me... I dont think ive EVER EVER Felt this way about anyone. Kurt I dont like you for your looks. I like you for you. For who you REALLY ARE. I liked everything about you i loved your smile your laugh your goofy comments just to make me smile/laugh, the way you would hold me, lol the way you walk ""its so cute"" . I could go on 4-ever.Kurtis i would really LOVE it if you would reply back to this, Im being serious if you dont than i guess............... U dont need to know.I just need to know you got this if you havnt replyd by sunday then i know you havnt read this and i guess i have to send it again. I really hope youve read this whole email. I made the FONT size bigger for you so you can see it. HEHE. Kurtis Im sorry for whatever i did to make you do this to me. But I also hope u know that i hurt i hurt bad, I wish i could just be a bird and fly away from my problems.I hope you know now i REALLY didnt mean to call u a FUCKUP................................................................
Im gonna go for a walk, and then go to sleep.

Love 
Bridgett   
 LeAnn   
  Ivey 


I wish i couldve had the chance to tell u all this in perrson. I was going to but u never really gave me the chance, Besides it wouldve been to dramatic i wouldnt want you to see me like this.

Ok u guys would u reply back to that if someone sent that to you...?? WEll im hoping it will finally get his attention. Oh just to fill u guys in Kurtis cheated on me with 3 other girls while going out with me and fucked one of the 3.... WOW I know rite. Well ppl im gonna go who wants to hear from a FUCK UP like me."

I told him he was a fuck up kinda mean but it is kinda fucked up how he lies and thinks no ones going to figure it out. I also said im going to be talking to katie im gonna see if he has lied to her too. and let her know whta hes been telling me.I feel pretty mean. But when ppl lie to you more than one dont you give them their lil payback? I think so.....But i think alot of things. Amanda is setting me up with Josh yates ive had the biggest crush on him since the 6th grade, and she is going to try me with Aaron :) he is soo funny. But yea i told Kurtis i would wait for him but if i meet ppl I feel like i have a good connection with uh im not waiting. I mean he didnt he goes out with someone so he should stay with her while HE CAN.</FONT></STRONG></P>"

"event","Im wide awake!! And i really miss Erica you know you never now how much your going to miss something until its gone... I miss goin to see her and tellin her my problems, i really needed her when kurtis broke up with me!!! And when i cut my hair, on the way home for some reason i told my mom to go by Ericas house so ican show her my new hair cut,. Then i stoped and ealized she didnt live down the road anymore, i started to ball. Its funny i miss Erica and i need kurtis. When i was with Kurtis he always i mean always put a smile on my face. And every time he would just smile at me for no reason i just felt so good because i knew he was thinking about me for atleast a split second.I just wish he would quit saying he was a fuck up becasue he really isint. I dont know what i would do without him. Me and amanda are crazy we are in love with 2 amazing guys, we both went out with them&nbsp; and now were not with them anymore.But for some reason me and amanda just feel like there is still a litle hope. But even if there werent any hope we wont ever give up on them.I just wish they could see how much we love them and how much we would do for them, why cant guys see that. Is it that hard to stop and realize how much someone loves you?? I mean sometimes it makes me feel like im not good enough for them, like im to ugly or you know. I wish guys could express there feelings like us girls can. But i guess thats the&nbsp;&nbsp;way it goes. Well thats whats been goin on in my head!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","A brunette, redhead, and a blonde go into a bar. The brunette says to the barkeep, ""I'd like a BL."" The bartender replies, ""What's a BL?"" The brunette answers in a snotty voice, ""A Bud Light. DUH!""
So, the bartender dutifully serves up a Bud Light. Then, the redhead says, ""I'd like an ML."" The bartender asks, ""What's an ML?"" The redhead answers, as if to a slow child, ""Miller Lite. DUH!"" 
After serving the redhead, the bartender, now wary and on alert, turns to the blonde.
She says, ""I'd like a fifteen, please."" The bartender thinks and then says, ""Okay, I understand that a BL is a Bud Light and an ML is a Miller Lite. But, I can't figure out what a fifteen is.""
The blonde rolls her eyes, tosses her hair and answers, ""A Seven and Seven. DUH!"""

You've never heard of Balticon before Alex introduced you,
And you call ME a poser?
Who cares if you never knew that I like Aerosmith, Kiss, or anyone else? 
I grew up with that shit. 
My parents like it.
Leave me alone and worry about your own sucky life and how no one likes you.

<font color=""red"">At Kabblat Shabbat Karina shined hte cd reflection in Morah Gutins eyes and she yelled @ her omg it was hilarious haha. and then were all talking and stuff.... haha... good times...</font>

<font color=""blue"">Today was really nice outside. We were over by the benches at recess and we danced without our shoes! w00t! Do the hustle, macarena, cotton eyed joe and more haha. God it was so hot. I mean i know i get sweaty really easily but i didnt do nething and i started sweating. But the wind felt sooooo good. oh god it was so perfect.</font>

<font color=""orange"">Then we picked out everyone's modes. Take a look:

Karina mode is when she gets relaly stuborn.
Danny mode is when he gets all geniusy.
Sean mode is when i go all charmed/ or when i get sulky.
Andy mode is when he loses control of his temper.
Daniel mode is when he needs anger management and takes it out on me.
Alex mode is when she gets all mad at david.
David mode is when he gets all chauvanistic.
Jordyn mode is when she gets all bipolar/ or when she starts going all drummy and BANGS ON MY LEG! haha

and i think thats all...</font>


Daily Insiders:

<font color=""purple"">DANIEL: Dont u take my shoes!

KARINA: haha the cd. Dancing rocks. the chicken dance! Slow motion lol

DANNY: What cd?

EMILY: emily mode is funny.

JORDYN: My leg! Stop banging it! God daniel eats like a piggy...

ANDY: Andy dropped the baaaaaall... lol</font>

So thats all for now! ttfn

<font color=""green"">So my bro got in trouble today. He had a project to make a map and he printed one out of mapquest and handed it in. Wow... He's taken stupidity to a whole new level. He's been doing bad and skool... well not bad... just not good lol. and he got grounded from computer till further notice. And he was promised a new bed if he got a B in Reading. and he got it to my family's surprise. But i doubt hes getting it now. He was also supposed to get a new comp, but after this stunt, my dad gave him a whole lecture . god it was horrible. He used me as an example every 3 words and i hate when he dus that. and then he took away the comp my bro was supposed to get and gave it to me. and is giving my bro my old one... this one... a month or so from now when he revamps it or w/e woohoo new comp but now i feel sucky. I <font size=""5"">HATE</font> when he does that... god.</font>

I'm just getting really sick of people accusing me of random things and thinking they know everything about mjy life ::cough cough:: lacey... Everyone think they know me so well. They sit there and tell me that I'm lying, that im wrong. They tell me who i like and dont like and basically think they are me. I'm really tired of it and I'm not going to take any shit from them nemore. Dont u dare tell me im lying or im wrong when im talking about myself. Id ont lie to anyone so shut up. Dont bombard me with questions. Wanna kno more about me? then shut up and listen rather than give me a lecture about what i do and don't like. Im sick of it!

It's time for you to concentrate your attention on all the little things that you've overlooked. Let's face it: you don't always clean up as you go and now details left untended may come back to haunt you. It is easier to make your list and start on it today than it will be in a couple of weeks when the stakes will be higher.

Still, opportunities for positive change are increasing and if you don't take a chance soon, it may be too late.

You've taken every way on contact away.  You've blocked me out completely.  Congrats?  I really don't know what to say.

Someone once told me....

"" Yeah...
But... I realized I was a hypocrite for just saying it's over. Because if you remember what I said when we first met, about how I'm adamant on a relationship being a two person thing. Two people have to make the choice to start, so it's not fair one person makes the choice to end it without talking about it.
So I kind of betrayed myself... but I'm still upset.""

I just wish that still stood true...  I wish that ""talking"" wasn't a one sided thing.  Me talking to myself pretty much.  It's like I'm talking to a brick wall when I try to talk to you about this shit.

""Christopher Holewski:
You once told me: ""The way a relationship works is; both people must want to be in the relationship. When both people want it, then no matter what happens in their lives, how far apart they are, how many fights they get into... everything is still in place with them, they both love each other, and those other things become insignificant""
I live by it.
You said you really thought about what I said when saying that two people chose to make a relationship work, and it's not fair one person can make it end... well really that was just a modification of what you had told me... I got that idea/belief from you.
That... I live by that. Not just in relationships but also in friendships and family matters.
And again with relationships""


I hope you read that.  I hope you think deeply about that.  Those thoughts have been hanging over my head recently...


You are still my motivation.  But not for everything anymore.  It's my turn to do things for myself.  Not to get a job to prove something to you.  Not to finsh school to prove something to you.  Those are for me.  Those are my goals.  And I'll be damned if they become another failure.  I refuse to fail.  I refuse to lose everything that I hold close.  I refuse..."

Anyways...

I hate this.  I hate the way the world is going.  I really do.  I know that in 2 years I'm going to have to make a decision that will effect my life.  I know that my opinion really doesn't matter,  it's the population as a whole,  but still.  I would like to think my decision counts for something.  I'm talking about voting.  I am not one to have a political opinion.  But as of recently,  I'm started to look into it.  Everyone at one point has talked shit about President Bush,  I know I have.  But thinking about it.

This is the moment that you know
That you told her that you loved her but you don't.
You touch her skin and then you think
That she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.
Yeah, she is beautiful but she don't mean a thing to me.

I spent two weeks in Silverlake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.
Yeah she was beautiful but she didn't mean a thing to me.

Wanted to believe in all the words that i was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that i was telling
And all the playful misspellings
And every bite i gave you left a mark

Tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did and so did i that day

All i see are dark grey clouds
In the distance moving closer with every hour
So when you ask ""was something wrong?""
That i think ""you're damn right there is but we can't talk about it now.
No, we can't talk about it now.""

So one last touch and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah you are beautiful but you don't mean a thing to me [x2]





""We Looked Like Giants""

God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime
Remembering when you were mine
In a still suburban town

When every thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes
And we'd learn how our bodies worked.

God damn the black night with all it's foul temptation
I become what I always hated
When I was with you then

We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact
As the others slept inside

And together there
In a shroud of frost, the mountain air
Began to pass from every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer than anyone would ever get

Do you remember the JAMC?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you but I swear on my name they could smell it on me
I've never been too good with secrets.
No...

And together there
In a shroud of frost and mountain air
Began to pass through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer..."

We can never not show
We can never go home
No, we can never elope

We've only got one choice
So let's keep making it
And making it
Making it
And making it

A lot of things can change
A lot of tears will dry
There's no way out of your head
I can't still drink like I'm trying

I never had to work too hard
Let's keep working it
And working it
Working it
And working it

You're like a test, I can't fuck up
You're like a song in my head, like a la la la la la like a dream
Don't wake me up and if I never see the light again
Well I guess they put me in the ground with this smile on my head, my love
My love

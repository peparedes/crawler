"event","I have a problem with Focus, and I don't mean my eyes, though that is also currently a minor issue.<br /><br />Here is the deal. I like to do things. When I REALLY get into it, I have absolute focus and few things can foist me out of it. This sounds good, doesn't it? Not really, and here is why. When I have been a roll and I focus on the one thing I am doing, I forsake everything else unless there is someone around to knock me out of it. This includes eating, drinking, standing and using the washroom. I have literally sat in front of a single computer all day without stopping for food, drink or nature's call. When I say all day, I typically mean 8 - 12 hours. So, now you see this isn't necessarily a good thing, right?&nbsp;<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, I find when I don't really want to do a thing I cannot focus. I have to dull out my other senses just to start to focus on something I don't want to really do. This sounds normal. This is what a lot of people do. Years ago, I would walk away from the project, leaving it laying around knowing or hoping i would get back to it, then go off and do something totally unrelated.&nbsp;As a result, I end up with a fairly unbalanced production record. Some things I finish in a day and other things in two or three days even if they are relatively similar in size and scope.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Read on to see how I balanced it out..."">Over time, I learned that if I wanted to get something I didn't find engrossing finished, I had to find a roundabout way to circumvent my lack of focus, so that I could get it finished and on to the next part. Initially, it was difficult to find something that kept me moving in the direction I wanted or needed. There was a lot of trial and error and a lot of stern talks from supervisors, managers and even bosses. I didn't want to be perceived as lazy or easily distracted, but in the end, it was always seen as such.<br /><br />Luckily, I discovered there were ways to both step away from a mind-dulling project and keep moving forward. I began going off to related projects. Say, for instance, I needed to make a webpage that had several boxes that just would not line up and follow the rules that I swear were properly coded. In this instance, you need to either ask for help from someone, or step away momentarily before returning to troubleshooting. When I was working in an office, I dealt with this in several ways. I went to the restroom, down to the store for a quick brain enhancing snack or drink, asked a coworker to check my work, or, if all these options had been unavailable for various reasons, I could search the internet for a related issue and return with fresh eyes to see where the problem was.<br /><br />Generally, when I searched the internet for a straight solution to my issue, I discovered other new ways to do the same thing, or I found other things I note for future implementation. In this way I was moving forward, while also distracting myself away from my forced focus for a while.<br /><br />This worked. It still took time for the projects I was working on that I didn't have extreme focus on, but I was also learning new things that made future projects take less time in the end. However, there is a trap here. Sometimes when I did this, I ended up finding things I enjoyed a lot more than the project I was researching and my auto-focus kicked in. This left me in as bad a position as when I started. Yes, when I did return to the project, I certainly did have fresh eyes and was able to fix the issues, however, it had taken three times as long because of the other side of my focus problem.<br /><br />I now had to figure out a way to circumvent the extreme focus and balance out the lack of focus, so that I could get work finished in a consistent manner. Luckily, I discovered a few methods.<br /><br />There is a program called <a href=""https://www.rescuetime.com/rp/niaskywalk/signup/solo/pro"" target=""_blank"">RescueTime</a>&nbsp;that will track your computer usage. The Pro version has a lot of useful features and I was gung ho on getting some kind of baseline to battle against. I discovered that although I thought I spent a lot of time looking for answer, I was also spending time on Facebook and other social networks. This isn't always bad, but it was rather high. With the help of RescueTime, I began lessening my social activity, which did result in more production.<br /><br />While RescueTime helped out a lot, there was still the issue of when I was being too focused. I tried various ways to ease this. I asked co-workers to make sure I talked to them at least at lunch time, I played music playlists that had a set time limit, and finally what ended up working most often was a timer. I didn't know anything about the 'Pomodoro Technique*' at the time. I just decided I needed a big distraction to kick me out of the extreme focus. I found an annoying alarm that would play through my headphones after a certain amount of time had passed. It had to be a large amount of time. I found if I hear an alarm too often, I can ignore it. Even the most annoying of sounds.<br /><br />The alarm worked. I set it to make sure I used the washroom, ate Lunch, and just socialized properly. It also worked for when I was stuck and losing focus. When I did the internet searching, I had the timer set to low amount. 5 -10 minutes. When the alarm rang, I would return to the project and attempt to continue. If i was in the middle of something that I evaluated as need-to-know, I set a snooze.<br /><br />Eventually, I started using it to challenge myself. Could I finish this part in 10 minutes? How about this part that usually takes 1 hour, could I finished it in 45 minutes? I didn't learn until many years after I started all this, that much of this was pretty much the Pomodoro Technique.<br /><br />In the end, I found a way to change my focus and to practice ways to get things done that was efficient at the time. Now working on my own, I have had to learn more ways to do this, since I no longer have coworkers and I have so many more distracting things like Housework, cooking, and projects. Here's to continuously learning, changing and adapting!<br /><br />Please comment and share!&nbsp;What have you done to help yourself focus? Have you tried any of these methods? Would you try any of these methods? What did or did not work for you?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />================================<br /><br /><br />* Pomodoro Technique = A method in which a physical ticking kitchen timer, originally the shape of a tomato, or <em>Pomodoro,</em> is set for 10 minutes. The task which one sets for oneself must be finished in this time and a break must be taken. Excellent tool to work on efficient productivity, forcing the user to get more done in less time.

A quick synopsis: Bakuman is a manga series written by the dynamic duo who wrote the insanely popular DEATH NOTE. (you've heard of that right??? Right???) But they are not doing another dark cult hit like that, instead they are taking a tour of the manga publishing industry. Sound boring? Wrong. We follow Mashiro, nephew of a one-hit-wonder mangaka, and his new buddy Takagi as they team up in middle school with the goal of being the most popular manga team of their era. Mashiro's drawing ability came to the attention Takagi who was looking for someone of quality to illustrate his many story ideas. Mashiro was hesitant, but Takagi finally won him over and the pair step into an intense adventure, from research to submission, from joy to defeat, but through it all, they are determined to get a serialization by the time they graduate High School. Gambatte!

After reading the first vol. I knew one thing for certain, I would never be able to do any professional manga, comics, writing or editing. Also, I realised I will never get away from Manga now that I found it. Yeah, I know. YOU know I couldn't do professional manga, heck -I- know I couldn't. I don't have the drive, I don't have the creativity required, and I am getting older. I didn't really want to do that anyway. And I am still amazed it took me as long as it did to get into manga in the first place. Can you say late (late, late, late, late, ...) bloomer?

So, if I am not gonna try to do such things professionally, why do I have <a href=""http://manga.smithmicro.com/index_ex.html"" target=""_blank"">Manga Studio</a>? Why am I <a href=""http://niaskywalk.deviantart.com/gallery/28406409"" target=""_blank"">practicing drawing manga style art</a>? Why, after reading the first volume of Bakuman, did I start <a href=""http://niaskywalk.deviantart.com/art/Sight-copy-of-Boris-Alice-page-203617421"" target=""_blank"">DRAWING WHOLE PAGES</a> from manga???

For that matter, why am I learning Japanese? Just to read Manga? Am I really that insane? and yet, I just grabbed one of my old manga phone books this morning with the intent of translating pages. I am spending that kind of money to learn a language just to read silly comics? Ok, so I wanted to read Light Novels as soon as I realised what they were... and yes, the dramas did pull me in for a while, but really. Why? what could i possibly use this for??

While I am at it, why have I been learning about story making and story techniques? I never use them. I attempt NaNoWriMo every year and every year there is a different outcome with ne'er a finish.

Seriously, who am I fooling? ;-)"

I found there are some nice tutorials out there for the older versions, so I can't wait to hook everything together and give it a whirl on my own!

Every time I sit in front of my computer to try to write ANYTHING, I just can't. I even tried writing a thought stream for five minutes non-stop... and while that worked, by the time I finished I was exhausted and I had no desire to continue. I tried writing lines of story at work and ended up with ""The tower was tall and empty."" um... yeah, not useful. Especially since I didn't feel like elaborating and just thinking about it exhausted me. *sigh*

Well, I can't really blame tiredness or anything, I have really been concentrating on finishing the box I am doing for a friend. It is mostly finished and I have an extra week to finish it more. I was gonna be content just to burn and sand the box to a nice finish, but with extra time I can get a stain and a sealer to make it even better.

I will have some pictures up at some point. But right now, the consensus of those who just see things: Oooh, Pretty. The consensus of those who see art: Amateur work, selling this for what? $10? (NO! Too much time spent on that to be only $10! Please don't go for that cheap!)

I am also forced to learn block/ink shading to make future pyrography look more pretty. So yeah, despite my failure to write, I am happy to report I am pretty decent at the rest of creativity."

As it turns out, I finally find a good pattern to describe on the box and it doesn't match my original design. I have only about a week left to finish it all so I can ship it in time... I may have to force it....

I think I need to find some kind of design class.... anyone have any free online tutorials handy? LOL

Anyone know how to stain and seal a box without buying chemical products? Maybe using stuff one could find in a kitchen? I don't have wax, but I do have tea... and modgepodge, what do you think?"

"event","I have to do art design for a box. Simple, I thought. Easy, I thought.

No problem, right? I came up with an idea... for the top of the box.. .but guess what? its a BOX so I have to come up with a design for the other four sides and probably a logo or something for the bottom.

I thought of LiveJournal because I recently was brought back LOL And I am curious to know your thoughts.

I have a small box, slightly curved on top but rectangular. The idea is to make it a box ideal for teas.

Method of decoration: Pyrography. 
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/niaskywalk/5057990245/"" title=""TeaTime-Sampler by NiaSkywalk, on Flickr"" target=""ArtBox""><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5057990245_4aec5acf6c_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""95"" alt=""TeaTime-Sampler"" /></a>
This isn't the design I am using... except maybe a few bits.

I have an idea of what style I want to use, but I am very curious. Tell me, if you were going to pick up a small tea box, what kind of designs would encourage you to pick it up?"

Not much has been going on. Not much is happening. My baby brother moved here to NYC. My two friends are so busy getting their chaos in order that I haven't seen much of them in the last few months. I am barely holding on at my new place which still needs a major cleaning. Thankfully my bro is helping with that.

One of my best friends had a heart attack a couple Friday's back, she had double bypass surgery the following Saturday and was home by Friday night. First thing she did when she got home and got her computer set up? Play WOW. Now that is amusing.

The past weekend was the combination New York Comic Con and New York Anime Festival. I have had a persistent cough for a week now (weather, stress, season change), so I was a little under the weather and dragging through out the whole glorious event.  I feel cheated. There was so much going on and no time to catch it and going through every section of the whole place was nearly impossible. I bet it was another record breaking year for the cons. For the first time ever, they were sold out on weekend and saturday passes... not just on Saturday but on Thursday. WOW. And it was CROWDED. Every person who had a badge at all MUST'VE been there. It was wild and very draining. I ended up sleeping all day today. Literally. And now I am tired again, hope I can wake in time in the morning."

"event","So I haven't been blogging or anything useful anywhere for a while. I am trying to get used to my new move and the new amount of travel involved. Oddly enough, though I am at a more expensive than previous apartment, I am actually using less money over all. I think all the impending doom stuff helped me more than I realised. I won't be able to do everything I wanted to do like join all the clubs and such that I want to join, but I will be able to do what I like still and MAYBE save money as well.

My birthday is in two weeks. I was actually asked what I want to do for my Birthday and I found myself dumbfounded. Rare. VERY RARE is it that I am asked what I want to do, not because I never celebrate it or anything, but because I either have something planned and tell everyone what to do or they have something already planned or I just go with the flow of knowing everything will happen as it happens. So when I was asked, I felt not only oddly curious, but poleaxed and it took me a while to figure out why. Now... my bday is two weeks from today and I am hanging with a group where we have one under age 21 so I cannot do a bar party or anything.... What do I do? We might end up with Korean Barbeque... yeah, that sounds good.
<lj-cut text=""Continue reading about my recent life..."">

I love my roommate. I was holding and holding out on finding an apartment and I was getting to the point where I would take just about anything because it would be cheaper than the next rent in my apartment, so when this opportunity presented itself, I was given two choices. One choice was more easily accessed, pay $925/mth A two month deposit, current month rent and final month rent, living with two guys I hadn't met and a cat that I had met in a gamerish haven, where one guy was an MIT grad and the other was going to FIT. Yeah... nearly $3000 to move in and I never met the roommates only the one who was moving. I kept trying to contact the other, I didn't want to go with the more expensive but beautiful place,I wanted the one that was advertised as $825/mth. Yeah, that was actually a little below my target, and I was having the darnedest time contacting her. When I went to my sister-in-law's play, I was shocked to discover the pleasant young lady I was chatting amiably with was the person I had been trying to contact. We made arrangements to view the apartment, but I knew IMMEDIATELY I would take this one because I got on VERY WELL with this chick. That was happy. The apt was messy. There was a lot of repairs needed, it was actually very crazy and the previous roommate was in the middle of moving her stuff out. The bedroom was small and the bathroom was only a closet, but there was so much of 'Me too!' while chatting with her, that I knew I would take the place. I did a little bit of searching, got the final number needed for the other apt, and made the decision to move in with this one. First day I moved in, she returned from a working thing wearing a pirate costume.... yeah. AWESOME start!

My roommate is into Ren Faires and we share similar interest in movies, we keep each other awake watching TV shows and searching music to amuse. Tom Lehrer is on the list. We are both night people, I like to cook she likes to bake, neither of us likes to rise in the morning. There is harmony here and I am lovin the move.

I am also hanging out with two people from Japanese school. One is in my class and the other is in a lower class. I have been busy busy busy nearly every weekend since the beginning of April and it doesn't seem to be letting up. I might have to shake loose one of these times so I can finally properly move in... my stuff is just PILED in my room and I have an entire weekend worth of laundry I need to work on, prolly about $50 worth that I have to pull down the stairs and over to the laundromat. I live in a third floor walk up and I just got used to the climb. Today for the first time the climb didn't exhaust me. YAY. Anyway, we hang out after every Japanese class and also at least once per weekend though we have been known to hang on several days with at least two of us three. It has been wonderful.

My gaming was cancelled in April when my DM's gameroom got flooded horribly. Each month he had to hold out as things were still up in the air finally he just cancelled the game entirely, there was no way he would get the room fixed in any decent timing. He will contact us all again and invite us to campaign when he gets his place fixed back to proper, but in the meantime, I think the only gaming I will do will be to try to get my two friends into gaming LOL I think I may be only half successful. I don't know if I will go back because I have gotten so busy, the only thing I can do is wait and see.

Did I miss anything? Probably but I will leave it to you to either ask me or wait for me to remember to do the next update. Hope you all are well as I haven't been following ANYONE except for occasionally on facebook. Perhaps my LJ mode is falling back in soon, we'll see.</lj-cut>"

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

I am moving, have been all month supposedly. In the unique situation (for me) of having paid for two apts in one month wheeeee.

This also happens to be one of the busiest months I have ever had since SDCC last year. so I have had NO TIME to pack/clean/move. Oh and 

we got a new teacher in Japanese..... her style is random and brutal. but we get homework and Kanji... I like homework.... however, April is not when I wanted to have this much homework at once not when I have to clean/pack/go to school/work 40hours/do all homework on my super long lunch!!!! gah!.... oh and I don't seem to be learning anything despite all the homework, FUN DAYS! ... except Kanji! YAY Kanji! We are getting five new Kanji a week. We get it on one day and then have a test the next class... Wait What??? I have to do kanji AND homework in ONE day???? crap!

Ok, sorry, I had to let people know why I am not posting.... even my facebook posts slowed down.

oh and I am totally not keeping up with ANYONE. tell me in a comment how you are doing and I will DEFINITELY see it thanks! see ya laters!"

Technically, I will be on the Queens side, but I have to travel through Brooklyn to get there. The difference is a block or two. I will be living with a Roommate! Yeah, it's a weird concept, but the apartment literally landed on my lap via Rick. I ended up meeting the person I will be sharing the apartment with, we were chatting and getting along when my mother came up and told me her name by introducing me as her daughter. I had been having issues contacting the person, so this was most fortunate. I ended up going to the apartment to check it out and nodding and agreeing with everything she said. The place is a little small, but it should be comfortable. Bonus: 24-hour coin laundry literally around the corner and two deep basins in the kitchen. I plan to complete moving in before May 1.... because I HAVE to go to the Sakura Matsuri in Brooklyn on May 1 and May 2. No excuses!

HOWEVER, I totally love how CLOSE to the manga this version is. I can't decide which one is better. I LOVE the Ikemen Paradise and I totally want to own it.... I am only on episode two, but I am cracking up know how the story will run.

This Nakatsu is awesome too. And the Sano... well, he is ok. Mebbe I will like him as it goes along... but the Umeda character is cracking me up! I haven't really seen much of the psychic kid, but so far he is amusing and not annoying or stupid. I will know for sure by the end I think :-)

<h2>Website Ideas</h2>
I was planning on making a new <a href=""http://www.niaskywalk.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""me"">front page</a> to go with <a href=""http://niaskywalk.livejournal.com/139675.html"" target=""_blank"">my newly created logo</a> (sorry if you can't see my logo&mdash;it is being hidden for the moment&mdash;it has features in common with <a href=""http://www.niaskywalk.com/Graphics/calendar/February.png"" target=""_blank"">this image</a>). The problem is... I want to use a desktop similar to <a href=""http://blog.niaskywalk.com"" target=""_blank"">my current blog</a>... but there is no way I could use the logo on a desktop like that without it looking stupid... even if I used it as a computer screen or a desktop 'item'. So I thought something silly that might work. How about if I make a glass and steel desktop? It'll look a bit futuristic, mebbe I need to make items with a glow/neon edges... so what kind of stuff would be on such a desktop? Do you have any opinions?

<h2>J-Drama</h2>
What is with so many singers from j-pop/j-rock groups as leading actors??? I have recently discovered KAT-TUN's Kamenashi Kazuya via <em>Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge</em> and SMAP's Takuya Kimura via <em>MR. BRAIN</em>. I looked at their list of shows and movies and they are long... just weird.. or I am just weird for happening to stumble into this? LOL prolly the later. 

In case you are wondering, before I even finished with <em>Hanazakari no Kimitachi e: Ikemen Paradise</em> a fellow student forced Yamato Nadeshiko on me so excitedly I couldn't NOT look to at least tell her I wouldn't watch the series.... stupid me. I not only found I LIKED the stupid thing, but that it is CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION.. thanks a lot Maria Theresa *sigh* (Yes, I am waiting for the Raws to be posted today. Subs won't be available until next week bah).

I was linking around and noticed a show that looked interesting, and indeed it is! Mr. Brain is a bit different and therefore something i am liking. It is a comedy crime drama focusing around Brian Science :-) Check it out at DramaCrazy.net... if they ask, you can say niaskywalk sent ya LOL. (dunno if there is a referral thing or anything, just saying in case)"

1. the girl playing Ashiya is good :-)

2. most of the guys are not as pretty as the manga, but that's okay.

3. The attitudes are slightly different in the drama, still wavering whether this is good or bad.

4. the story is different from the manga, but it has much better flow and foreshadowing... and sadly I admit the story is better. I hope I won't be disappointed by the ending of the series like I was disappointed by Fruits Basket's anime.....

5. I really like how they portray the psychic kid and Nakatsu is right on! *hugs Nakatsu*

So I am wishing him a Happy Birthday here. Just because I feel like I should do SOMETHING.

Makoto-sensei, Tanjoubi Omedatou Gozaimasu!"

"event","Lately, I have been getting behind in posting to all my blogs and journals. Its not like I was ever consistant to begin with, but when I had a happy bit of software at my fingertips, it became the most simple of actions to update any one of my journals or blogs at anytime... and with the bringing of FireFox 3 the convenient application disappeared to buggy annoyance. As a result, I am looking for a new desktop blog application.

When I looked at Wordpress.org for suggestions, I found a few that really stood out and looked like they may be worth my time. So I am taking a little time to check out a few of them. Using each through its trial period.
<h3>What I am looking for...</h3>
There are a few things that are important to me. Any application I am going to use must offer a decent WYSIWIG alongside the ability to edit the HTML at my own discretion. I don't want the program to suddenly decide to add its own markup, similar to MS Word's way of doing things. Next, it must be able to access any number of blogs and journals. If I can't access at least thoes I update frequently, it wouldn't be worth it. I must be able to add tags and/or categories, depending on circumstances. Above all, it MUST be LiveJournal friendly. I have my userpics maxed on that LJ and I must be able to choose my icon for each post. Having new features to offer to me is a bonus any of the applications.

<h3>Next Up</h3>
<a title=""BlogDesk Website"" href=""http://www.blogdesk.org/en/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">BlogDesk</a>. When I was going through the list of blogging apps available, BlogDesk was my second choice to try.
<lj-cut text=""More..."">
<img src=""http://blog.niaskywalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/ukokulean_ssjbento.png"" alt=""ukokulean_ssjbento.png"" title=""ukokulean_ssjbento.png"" width=""100"" height=""100"" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-249"" align=""right"" title=""created by LiveJournal user ssjbento"" />As a blogging application, it isn't too bad. It offers the ability to save drafts and add links, pictures and other media. There is a simple text formatting tool bar and a spellchecker. A unique feature is the ability to save notes or frequently used phrases. Just hitting F6 calls up the notes for easy reference and copy/paste while F7 calls up the phrases for point and click ease. When you log into a wordpress account it also downloads all the category options.

There is a tag module, it allows you to add tags, but it doesn't seem to want to retrieve them. The option is also available to add tags directly into the text of your post. You can use categories, but any hierarchy is ignored in the applications viewer. This doesn't affect the heirarchy at the source, so one would simply need to remember which categories go with which heirarchies. There is an option to link images to external sources, but nothing convenient like ""Link to a flickr image"". If you have special features plugged into your wordpress, you can't download the the special codes automatically to the 'WordPress options' utility, you would have to enter them manually or ignore them completely.

This application, like the one I reviewed previously, is without header formatting options. Perhaps I am a little goofy to want headers, does anyone else use them? I might cease to use headers if I have to keep fixing them manually in the source view constantly. I love seeing the option to send my links to a new page when I insert links, but I would like to see the setting of class, id or rel as well.

Over all this is a pretty decent application. I only experience two major frustrations. The first had to do with setting a scheduled post. While the software allows you to change the date and time of the draft, there seems to be a communication issue when posting to the blog. Thankfully the screen doesn't clear until the issue of posting is resolved, since there is no auto-draft option and I hadn't saved my work. I got it to go the blog by changing a few options. However, when the date arrived, the post didn't post as scheduled. I tried to reset the schedule at the website and found that date passed as well. I don't know what caused the issue overall, if it was wordpress or BlogDesk, but the resultant is it took time to finally fix the issue and post the post.

The second major frustration was the fact that this client is only available for wordpress, moveable type, drupal, serendipity and expression engine. I can't post to my blogger or LJ/LJ-Clone accounts. Therefore, despite all the decent features available, this client is a total letdown for me.</lj-cut>
<h3>Result</h3>
I like the client for the most part. It didn't blow me away, but it also wasn't so filled with features that my posts got lost in them. The fact that I can't post to my other blogs puts a major damper on my excitement with this product. If you are only using database/php blogs, this product is for you. I feel you could probably tweak it in many ways and have it to be the most satisfying addition to your desktop blogging experience. However, if you are like me having blogs across different platforms, this product is probably not for you.

I fell in love with <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/EarthArt"">EarthArt</a> (Laura Sue Peters) on Etsy.  I have three of her pieces in my living room.  I didn't care how much they cost, I saw them and had to have them... they spoke to me.

"event","Tonight I overcame a massively huge hurdle in my life. 

I RAN. For the first time since injuring my knee 5 years ago, I ran on the treadmill. 

Today was a series of ups and downs for me. I had originally intended on going to the gym early to get some treadmill and bike time in before my water aerobics class, but I ended up not having enough time to do so. I was so disappointed about not being able to go early, I almost didn't go at all. My husband, being the amazingly awesome guy that he is, basically forced me out the door. He put the car keys in my hand and said, ""I love you, see you later!"" 

When I got there, I sat in the locker room for 10 minutes, trying to figure out what I was doing. I was feeling lazy, not wanting to do anything, pissed at myself for being where I didn't want to be. But I figured, since I was already there, I needed to find the motivation to actually get something accomplished. 

I channeled Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper from the Biggest Loser. What would they say? I went through my mental checklist of all the slogans, lines, everything I've ever told myself that was motivating. Ok. I decided I'd stay. But now what should I do? 

Should I go to the water aerobics class? Or should I get on the treadmill? I decided to think about what would be more rewarding for me, because this whole exercise session was difficult for me and I needed that reward. Considering the fact that I'd need to take my GoWear Fit off for the class, I thought it'd be more rewarding if I left it on so that I could see the results on my computer afterwards. 

Ok so I went upstairs to the gym and got on the treadmill. And I kept thinking to myself, I want to run, I want to run. The tempo in the song I was listening to kicked up, and I decided this was it - I increased the speed on the treadmill and I ran. 

I nearly cried right there. True, I couldn't keep it up for long because I felt like my heart was about to burst, but I actually did it! And it didn't hurt! And it didn't give out on me! I ran three more times in my 30-minute session on the treadmill, for a total of four short bursts of speed. I am so incredibly proud of myself."

"event","About a month ago, we came to the earth-shattering conclusion that we were $800 in the hole every month.  So we took a hard look at our budget, asked for advice (Trent from <a href=""http://www.thesimpledollar.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Simple Dollar</a> was a great help), and drastically cut our spending.  Even after that, we were still $200 in the hole.  So we looked again, this time making small changes to as many things as we could.  But as of last week we were still in the hole about $20.  I could live with $20 - we recently sold some personal property that could get us by until I was able to turn in my car lease.  However today, my husband's dad called and they said they were considering moving their cell phone service to a different company.  Since we're on their bill (the Friends and Family plans help keep prices down, I tell ya), we'd either have to switch with them, or lose our cell phones.

So, byebye cell phones, and hello magicjack.  Instead of spending roughly $420 a year on cell phones, we're now spending about $18 a year.  So now we're saving $400 a year, and we're back in the black by $15.  HELL YEAH!  And since we paid for 5 years up front, we don't have to worry about a phone bill for the next 5 years.

In other news, I <a href=""http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=6964317"" target=""_blank"">read a story today</a> about a guy who observed a drunk driver, and then when the guy stopped at a red light, he jumped out of his car, ran over to the jackass drunk driver's car, turned off the guy's car, took his keys, and called the cops.  I really want to send him a thank you letter - so much so that I actually looked him up on yellow.com, to find that his address is indeed listed. ;)"

"event","I'm 27 now; these are goals to be completed before my 30th birthday.  I wrote these goals when I was 22.  <lj-cut text=""Here's the status."">

1. <strong>Build and own or just own a house.</strong>  While this is one of my highest priorities, it has not yet happened, but for all the right reasons.  Every time I get ""house rabies"" Vinnie is there to hold me back from doing something stupid.  He's been a rock when it comes to making the right decisions at the right time.  Rest assured, however, that before I am 30, I will have my house.
2. <strong>Take a picture of a sunset in at least 5 different countries in Europe.</strong>  This goal has become less important really.  Back when I was 22 I really wanted to see Europe, but now that I have money I'm realizing that I have better things to spend it on.  This one is looking like it'll have to be put on the next list.
3. <strong>Have or adopt a child.</strong>  I decided this wasn't for me.  No kids.  No kids at all.  And to stress this point, a year ago I got sterilized, and earlier this year Vinnie did as well.
4. <strong>Get a dog!</strong>  I decided this goal was also not for me.  After having pet after pet, I realized that I simply cannot take care of another being.  I'm not good at it and I hate doing it.  Therefore, in an effort to *not* make an animal's situation turn from bad to worse, I will simply have to be happy with LOLcats and Cute Overload.
5. <strong>Be happy if not ecstatic about my career, or be in school to get a better one.</strong>  Mission accomplished.  Yay!
6. <strong>Have at least one, preferably two, masters degrees.</strong>  Mission accomplished here as well.  Yay!  I do want to get another masters or a PhD though.  Probably not before I'm 30 but knowing me I'll probably at least start on it before then.
7. <strong>Have zero (or one) credit cards.</strong>  I accomplished this for a while, but in order to try to help my credit rating I decided I could handle *a* credit card.  I started off using it for gas and paying it off every month, but it didn't quite work out the way I had planned.  <del>Which means tonight I'm going home and canceling all my credit cards.</del> Done.  I'm back down to one credit card now.  (All the others had a $0 balance anyway.... yay me!)
8. <strong>Have $10,000 saved/invested.</strong>  Well due to my grandma's benevolence, I have recently accomplished this goal.  Without her, I wouldn't have been able to do it.  The economy is too bad, and jobs are too scarce.  So... mission accomplished.
9. <strong>Be comfortable in my own skin.</strong>  I think at some point I was comfortable, but I am not at the present time.  I need to have a gastric bypass done, as it may be the only way I can be normal-sized again.
10. <strong>Be confident about my faith (or lack thereof).</strong>  I'm fine with having no religion.  I'm happy exploring the world around me.  And I'm passionate about supporting human rights no matter what they are.  This is my faith.  Mission accomplished.</lj-cut>"

This weekend my lovely husband will be visiting, and we've got quite a day planned for Saturday.  The SciFest is going on at the <a href=""http://www.slsc.org/"" target=""_blank"">St. Louis Science Center</a>, and we'll be attending two talks, as well as a trivia game (complete with adult beverages) in the evening!  We've also broken up the day with a trip to the always excellent <a href=""http://www.bacanabrasil.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bacana Brasil</a>.    I'm really looking forward to it.

Currently I am in the midst of creating him a present.  I started it the day after we got married and I'm thinking it'll be done before our three year anniversary in November.  I'm sure I'll post pictures once I finish it.  It's all lovey-dovey stuff, so I don't actually expect anyone to really want to witness the mushiness.  Therefore I'll make sure it's behind a cut. ;)

Also, I've been talking to my friend a lot lately, the lovely young lady who will be getting married here shortly, and she was happy to hear that I had rearranged my flight so that I could actually attend the entire duration of her wedding ceremony and reception.  And we talked for a while tonight, and she made me laugh so hard I nearly cried... not that I even remember what we were giggling about.

I've been feeling good this week.  Knowing that tomorrow night I'll be receiving kisses and hugs and lots of sweet talk from the love of my life.... well let's just say that the thought has gotten me through a relatively eventless week at work.  (Eventless, of course, until this morning's announcement at the staff meeting.  But, whatever.)  :)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""My wedding day..."">So.  Everything went swimmingly today.  I am now legally married.

I guess I can say that it started last night when his plane arrived early.  It seemed like a good sign.  And on my way to the airport I saw the moon low on the horizon, which always makes it look huge, and it was so pretty, so I saw that as a good sign too.  And I drove right beneath Vinnie's plane as it was landing.  And I arrived at the airport about 1 minute before Vinnie walked out.  And Vinnie really wanted Schlafly's No. 15 beer, so I took him down to Schlafly's brewery to see if we could get some - they were all out of bottles, but the nice lady at the counter suggested we take home a ""growler"" - a half gallon of beer from the tap, which made Vinnie very happy.  Anyway, all of these things were good signs. :)

We woke up early today to go down to the county office that issues marriage licenses.  The building was laid out very well and the person who helped us was very nice.  Afterwards we went out to breakfast, and then walked around the nearby mall.  I putzed around a really nice tea store and I think I will go back there the next time I'm in the area.  Then we headed to the county courthouse and the only parking I could find was at a meter, but sadly I had no change!  I found a meter with 12 minutes left on it, and as I was getting out of my car I saw some ladies walking nearby and asked them if they had any change for a dollar.  They gave me their change and didn't want my dollar.  How sweet!  Yay!

Anyway, then we went into the courthouse and got in line to have our papers readied and get our number for the judge.  We were #6!  Apparently everyone in line in front of us went to another judge, and then they started numbering for OUR judge just before we went in.  Yay!  So we waited around till about 1pm, when the judge was available, and everyone piled into the courtroom.  The couple who had been in front of us were up there, and I mentioned to Vinnie about how the judge was talking very quietly to each couple who came up, and said she must be telling them secrets that only married people know.  Vinnie said ""No, she's telling them that they have 48 hours to get it annulled"" and I lol'd.  People turned around and looked at me hahahaha.....  But who cares... we were next in line...

We went up there and the judge asked us if we'd ""love, comfort, and encourage... have and hold, for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part"" etc.  It was all very sweet and the judge was really a lovely lady.  I couldn't look at Vinnie because I was getting all misty eyed and I would probably have burst into tears if I had hahaha... Anyway, we said our I do's, she said we were hubby and wifey-poo, and everyone clapped, and I nearly walked away from him without kissing him hahaha.... DUR.  Damn I'm retarded.

Anyway, it was a great day and I'm very happy right now.  I unfortunately had to drop him off at the airport around 6pm though.... So it's been a lonely evening and I can't wait till I can see him again.  I love my husband.  :-D

(And we both agreed, in the car on the way home, that we don't feel any different.  Though I said it may take a while to sink in.  And I was right - I feel different now.  I feel... well.  You know.  And if you don't know, I suggest you find out.)

"event","Well I don't know about you, but I had an excellent weekend.  Vinnie was here, which of course made it perfect.  He flew in on Friday evening, and once he got in we pretty much just went to sleep.  In the morning we got   up extra early so that I could go to the grocery store and pick up a few things I needed to make him corned beef in the crock pot.  I got that started, and we bummed around the apartment for most of the afternoon, except for when we went out to get a cold pack for my new wine tote.  Dinner-time came around and Vinnie was impressed as usual with my cooking skills.  He actually started tearing up about it... hahaha.... he was appreciative of the nice dinner I made for him, and that despite all the hard work put into his dinner, I was still able to make my own, separate dinner since I shouldn't eat corned beef (too much sodium).

Anyway.  Sunday we drove out to <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=augusta,+mo&ie=UTF8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox&z=15&iwloc=addr"" target=""_blank"">Augusta, MO</a> to the <a href=""http://www.montelle.com/"" target=""_blank"">Montelle Winery</a>.  The drive was really nice, but the view from the deck  outside the winery was even better.  <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/jessica.m.walker/MontelleWinery?authkey=A56LrqkxhCc"" target=""_blank"">We took pictures</a>.  :)  After that we headed home to decide what to do about dinner.  Vinnie decided upon an interesting place he had noticed before, called <a href=""http://www.bacanabrasil.com/"" target=""_blank"">Bacana Brasil</a>.  It was SOOOOOO good, and also was the source of a new personal joke between Vinnie and I.  As if we didn't have enough of those.

Yesterday (Monday) we went to the St. Louis Zoo.  The zoo is free to the public, which is pretty cool, but it's $10 to park your car in their lot (not that you have to do that anyway - the zoo is located within Forest Park and you can park anywhere in the park for free).  Also, we decided to spring for the Safari Pass, which got us a few extra goodies like unlimited train rides and a 3D movie.  <a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/jessica.m.walker/StLouisZoo?authkey=coiLnceY5V8"" target=""_blank"">We also took LOTS of pictures of this event</a>.  Eventually I'll add the web albums to my website, myspace, and facebook, but for now they will remain in Picasa.

I hope you all had an excellent weekend.  The next trip is mine.... I get to go back to Michigan for September 12th through 14th.  It'll be my first trip home since moving to Missouri in mid-July."

"event","So Vinnie was here for the weekend, that much I think you've gathered if you looked at the picture I posted.  If you didn't, then well that's fine too hahaha.... Anyway.  I'd been going exploring, as one is wont to do when alone and bored.  I recently found a neighborhood that was, for lack of a better word, CREEPY.  I found my way in but had a very hard time finding my way back out again.  Why?  Because there were no street signs.  No stop signs, nothing.  And the houses... well most of them were burnt to the ground, and the ones that were still standing were graffiti'd on and falling apart.  It was like a scene out of a horror flick, only I was in it, and I had no idea how big the neighborhood was and if I'd ever be able to make it out again.

But luckily eventually I did.

I went back home with a pounding heart and pretty much freaked out to Vinnie over Skype.  He laughed at me of course, not realizing the horror I had just experienced.  The ass.  So I told him when he came out again, I'd take him there in the middle of the night and drop him off, and see how he liked it.  And of course he said that that wouldn't be fair, since he doesn't live here and doesn't know the area.... wah wah wah.  Anyway.  So he was here last weekend and I took him to the neighborhood.

No I didn't drop him off in the middle of the night like I wanted to.

But he did find the place pretty cool.  He said it was what a neighborhood would look like after the apocalypse, and he's absolutely right.  He was thanking me all night for taking him there.  I honestly didn't see what was so cool about it.... it scared the bejezus out of me.

On our way out, I found the one stop sign in the entire neighborhood, and I thought I'd be all cool and say ""hey, watch me blow right through this stop sign.""  So, me, being the cool chica that I am, just rolled on through it.  And then Vinnie says, ""Ok, now stop, and then reverse back through it."" heheheh....  wouldn't it have been even funnier if there had been a cop there, watching the only stop sign in the neighborhood?  hahaha.... anyway.

Upon returning to my apartment I looked up the neighborhood.  Apparently it's a sore spot with some people, as the airport started ""acquiring"" houses in there nearly 20 years ago.  The last person moved out sometime in 2007, and yet the airport has let the place rot.  The streets are nice and the neighborhood is full of trees and nice green lawns - it'd be a really nice place to live... but the airport wants to turn it into a runway, nevermind the fact that a giant highway goes right through the area... duhhh....

But if you want to know more about it, I found a <a href=""http://56housesleft.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> and a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/radio_inactive/sets/72157600717565277/"" target=""_blank"">set on flickr</a> that were pretty interesting.  And for some reason the Post Dispatch (our newspaper out here) <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/7295A4D6CB5BEA5A862574A90015131F?OpenDocument"" target=""_blank"">did a story on it</a> just the other day."

"event","So yesterday I got home from school.... and the house was clean.  Kitchen was swept and mopped and the dishes were done and the stove was cleaned... and the house was vacuumed, and the bathroom was done.... and the side door was fixed (it had been popping out of the frame) and and and there were roses and tulips waiting for me in the living room.

I am loved.

Today we went out to breakfast and I updated Melvindale's web page and dusted the kitchen (blinds and stove vent and on top of the microwave) and my office (on top of my bookcase) and then vinnie stole my swiffer duster and went and did his office and the living room.

Now we're lounging on the couch with the windows and doors open and I'm enjoying the quiet.  Yes it's only 59 degrees outside but damn is it nice out.  I saw the neighbors hauling out their bbq earlier, and I'm looking forward to the yummy smells. :)"

"event","I am happily being lazy this week.  Although I should actually do some homework at some point.  Anyway, now that I am done working for the LIS Program I've got more time to do stuff.  Like go to the gym.  Like do homework.  Like work on other stuff that interests me.  None of which I have done yet but... yeah yeah I'll do it eventually. :-D

On February 16th I'm going to a party at the Director's house.  I'm really excited about it.  I even bought Vinnie a <a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/apparel/hats-ties/57ff/"" target=""_blank"">new tie</a>.  I wanted to see if anyone at the party was geeky enough to know what it says.  :-D  So yeah, that'll be neat.  And then two weeks later there's an NK Social Event in Plymouth, at the <a href=""http://www.gewinebar.com/"" target=""_blank"">Grape Expectations Wine Bar</a>.  I'm excited about that too, since I joined that group a while ago and never had a chance to get involved until now.  I'm so happy I have more time....  And I'll have even more in May... yays!!!  Hahahah anyway, I didn't know about the wine bar in Plymouth so I'm glad to be going, cuz I like wine. :)

Oh and Vinnie found out about this place nearby that sells lots of international beers, and we're gonna go there at some point and try lots of good new things.  I'll have to remember to keep a list of the ones I like. :)

My sister's 29th birthday is on the 13th.  I can't believe next year she's going to be 30.  It's nuts.  I'm next though.... argh.  <lj-cut text=""My sister, who was always and is still beautiful.""><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/jessica.m.walker/DigitalHumanitiesSummerInstitute/photo?authkey=wVsnWkoUlOE#5078172904142924546""><img src=""http://lh6.google.com/jessica.m.walker/RnlLWdtz6wI/AAAAAAAAAKM/NZmcmrlSi7U/s144/27%20-%20Leslie%20Smiles.jpg"" /></a><a href=""http://picasaweb.google.com/jessica.m.walker/DigitalHumanitiesSummerInstitute/photo?authkey=wVsnWkoUlOE#5078172942797630354""><img src=""http://lh3.google.com/jessica.m.walker/RnlLYttz65I/AAAAAAAAALU/lfcg_Npc0hk/s144/36%20-%20Babies%20Don%27t%20Know%20How%20to%20Hold%20Still2.jpg"" /></a>

For some reason I never saw myself at age 30.  Who knows.  Maybe I'll die before then.  I wonder if the government will expect Vinnie to pay off my student loans if I die after we get married.... that would suck.

On another note, I think if I make it to say, 70, it'll be cool.  Cuz Vinnie and I will be having just as much fun then as we do now (assuming he's still alive too hahaha).

So yeah, total randomness today.  I think I'll <a href=""http://www.basicinstructions.net/2008/02/how-to-deal-with-someone-who-doesnt.html"" target=""_blank"">shut up</a> now. :)"

So, in no particular order...
1. Learn Java
2. Learn Flash
3. Regularly update my website
4. Take a sewing class
5. After taking said sewing class, make aprons to sell on <a href=""http://www.etsy.com"" target=""_blank"">etsy</a>.  (I used to make aprons and they were really neat, and according to my searches, nobody makes them like I do, and I think they'll be a hit!)
6. Take a knitting class, for crying out loud, and learn how to do it right for once!
7. Learn Photoshop
8. Actually have sex on a regular basis... I know, scary, right?
9. READ FOR FUN.
10. Get as involved as possible in my field....
11. Start saving for retirement
12. Travel?
13. Go on a cruise when I'm not so fat...
14. Have fun adventures with my future husband.
15. Piano lessons?
16. Learn how to make stuff with wood?
17. Take a cooking class or two.

more to come, when i think of it..."

We haven't decided yet which one we'll take when, but we both think it's a really great idea.  So it'll be just under $900 for a bedroom in the train, and the trip will take 42 hours (and then some, because Amtrak has a personality hahaha) between Vegas and Detroit.  The plane tickets are (for right now) about $140 one-way per person, and we've sort of already paid for them anyway (since we didn't use our CA tickets).  Not only that, but we won't be spending as much time or money in Vegas, which is just fine by me. :)  And November is a great time to be out in the desert since it won't be too hot.

Man.  I am LOVING this idea. :-D"

I'm having a New Years Party... er... at least I'm trying to.  I invited like 14 people... so far some of the ones I REALLY wanted to be there aren't coming. :-(  Wah!!!  I'm thinking this'll just be like my birthday party when I was 12... one person showed up.  It'll be a reminder as to why I never have parties.  Nobody likes me enough to come. ;)

Wednesday I'm doing dinner/movie with my old boss.  And possibly <lj user=""blinkonce4yes"">, if boss-lady invites her hahaha...

And tomorrow night it'll be a double-date with <lj user=""blinkonce4yes""> and her boy.  We're gonna see the new National Treasure movie, yays!  I can't wait.  I really liked the first one, and I'm surprised it took me so long to see it.

And Saturday night it's another double-date with my friend Andrea and her boy.  Sheesh.  All this double-dating... and it was so hard once to just find <b>A</b> date... hahaha...

Yep.  All this on top of the fact that both Vinnie and I are sick.  He's a lot worse off than me (I eat a lot better than he does, thus, I'm getting more nutrients/vitamins).  So.  Who knows!"

I asked her what brought her there and she says she got into trouble and had to do community service.  Come to find out, she got caught driving drunk.  I said ""I hope you're not offended by this, but I feel absolutely no sympathy for you since a friend of mine was killed by a drunk driver in May.""  We continued talking about it... I made her promise she'd never do it again, and I told her I hoped she learned her lesson.  I mean, this is me, age 26, berating a woman in her late 30s to early 40s about drinking and driving... this was weird for me because it's so out of character (I NEVER talk that way to people older than me)...  I guess.... in a way something good came from his death.  It taught me a lesson and I'm paying it forward.

So while we were at his parents' house for Thanksgiving, his dad gave me a bunch of presents hahaha... Steve goes to auctions around where he lives and buys stuff really cheap to sell on eBay.  He had this really tall antique-looking lamp that he just *gave* me - it'd normally go for probably $100 at LEAST.  And he gave me some jewelry and a little asian jewelry box.

And we played the Wii with Vinnie's sister.  It was fun.  I want one. :)

I love going out there, his family is great.  It's not the usual tension and stress like it is with my family.  Steve and Nancy are very laid back, and funny, and I like talking to them.  I'm glad that I'll have great in-laws hahaha...

Next semester is going to be strange.  Not only will I be working (the choice is between 1 job with 40 hours and no sick/holiday pay OR 2 jobs totalling 32 hours, one with sick/holiday pay and a <i>chance</i> at promotion), but I will be taking two classes (one online, one in person on Saturdays), and trying to complete a practicum (90 hours total for the semester, which breaks down to about 6 hours a week).  That and applying for jobs, seeing as how, at the end of all that, I will be done with school.  For a long time.  I'm setting the doctorate idea on the back burner for now.

Anyway.  I don't know.  I miss my Vinnie-time.  I don't get as much time with him as I'd like and it's starting to make me crazy.  Well at least today it is, because I'm all emotional (it's oh so fun being a girl).  Yeah, and I'm considering a job in South Dakota?  What the heck is wrong with me?  I can barely be away from him for a week (my BC trip proved that) and I'm considering something like six months?  A year?

I said ""Everything in my life is perfect, except when it comes to her.""  To which she replies ""Do you really expect there to ever be a time when everything's perfect?""  ... This is the type of woman she is.  Thought provoking.  Intelligent.  Introspective.  Amazing.  Encouraging.

I don't know how she deals with cancer.  She told me the story today of what had happened...  kind of the backstory to how she got to where she is now.  Well she knew something was wrong and she couldn't get a doctor's appointment for 4 weeks and so she paid for a body scan.  That was when they found the mass... and it was so huge, and covering everything, that they couldn't tell what it was attached to...  Well eventually they cut it out, now she's going through chemo.

It's probably the toughest thing in the entire world to see someone so strong, someone you respect with every cell of your being, sitting in front of you, still being so strong... but wearing this wig, and wearing the body of someone going through this.  And the chemo is effecting her brain too... her short-term memory isn't working as well... argh.  I hate it.  I hate it i hate it i hate it.

But she's still beautiful.  She's still spectacular.  She's still the most amazing woman I've ever known, and I'm lucky to know her..."

No, I'm paying $2600, which is the amount I had originally charged on the card and no doubt should be responsible for paying.  Thank goodness they finally caved...  damn.  I lucked out.

one of my creditors called me a minute ago, I owe them $2,615.  They are about to send the account to their legal department.  They're offering me a settlement - 45% of what I owe, which would be $1,180.  That's a total steal.  I have till the end of the month to pay them.  Now I just have to find $1,180.  This would be no problem if they told me I have till the end of January.  I get my student loans in January.

Vinnie and I are thinking about cancelling our trip in December.  But we're selfish and really want to go (not to mention everything's pretty much all paid for).  It'd be such a pain in the ass to cancel, since we bought everything on his old credit card.  That one's cancelled, he's got a new one with 0% APR.  Anyway.  I don't know what to do.

This deal is gonna go away and my screw-ups will land me even further into the court system than I would prefer to go.

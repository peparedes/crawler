"event","CRRFs, BA Tool, Siebel Sales, and ""1-1"". The evils in my life.

First, I download the most recently updated Custom Request Rule Form (CRRF).  Then I fill out every last detail about my client in the Macros along with all the requirements of the custom clinical rule I need.  Now, I don't build the rule, but only take what comes from the client and put it into this form.

Second, I go to Siebel Sales, aka ""Siebel"". In the office, we have a fake magnetic cockroach in the office given the name Siebel, so obviously we respect this web based program around my office very, very much.  Here, I again fill out elements about the client (total lives, priority of the request, estimated completion date, more numbers that correspond to different groups of lives). Then I get a Siebel Request (SR) number. 1-F6ZZA

Third, I go to the BA Tool. The thought of going to this web based Business Administrator Tool makes me cry and squeeze my stress ball. First, I select my client - because I do have more than one. Then, I fill out an activity on the BA Tool with all the client information and all activities that the account team (not just myself) need to do to finish the task -  and also submit that SR number 1-F6ZZA. I submit that, but I am not yet done.

Fourth, I submit a business module on the BA Tool.  Here I have to choose from all of the types of things I could be installing, removing, or changing with regard to the client.

Fifth, I submit an instance within the business module on the BA Tool. I then click to attach and name the enrollment form (the CRRF), the email from the client document the requirements, and any other emails documenting what needs done and who is doing it. I then click into the instance once I have attached things to it. Now, I CONFIRM that I have attached the necessary forms and documents to complete the request.

Sixth, I email someone to be sure that I sent the BA Tool things appropriately. Believe me, this is a necessary step, as sometimes the forms get sent to an email box that is available to many people who do nothing with the dated request that was promised to the client.

Seventh, I go back and forth between the client and this internal department because obviously this department did not ask all the possible questions about the clinical rule on the rule form. So, we have to document the questions and comments in an Excel sheet (the coding issues log) as the rule is coded.  Then, that issues log nees attached to the BA Tool.

This is SOP - standard operating procedure - at my company. Oh, joy!

----

I submitted 17 BA Tool instances each with their own Siebel submission and form this week. Even after saying all that I said above, words cannot describe the Hell I went through this week and will continue to go through until the end of the year. The term ""1-1"" means something totally yucky to me; 1-1-07 when the stuff all needs to be changed, submitted, reviewed, installed, and labored over. Post ""1-1"" is usually just as fun as the stuff is all done by humans and human err can exist in any or all parts. Then, I have more forms to fill out! :)"

Tuesday was the exact opposite of Monday.  My supervisor was away at training for 6 hours of the day - nice.  Then upon returning, she did nothing but praise my project I had completed by staying late on Monday.  She absolutely loved the presentation and the project.  This affords me much relief.  Go me!!  Now that she is starting to understand me and how I work, I am going to have to figure her out - this may take a while!

Now, for the more present tense.  The events of hump day:

Today was good - orientation and traing day for me.  Our company's normal in house senior computer technician is out this week - the week I have an Outlook issue of course.  So I had to deal with some woman (a non-senior computer tech) who didn't know as much as I do about computers.  The futile effort was noted, but Larry will clear everything up on Monday.  Maybe women shouldn't work in computer related jobs - it seems to come so much more naturally for men to get it.  I mean, women didn't invent computers.  Go work as a nurse delivering babies, hunny!  *Just kidding*

<i>Eve called out to God, ""Lord, I have a problem.""

And God answered, ""What's the problem, Eve?""

""I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious snake, but I'm just not happy.""

""And why is that, Eve?""

""Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples.""

""Well, Eve, in that case, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you.""

""What is that, Lord?""

""It will be a flawed creature with many bad traits.  He'll lie, cheat, and be vain; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things. So you'll eat more than apples. Also he will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be too
smart, so he will also need your advice to think properly.""

""Sounds great,"" said Eve, ""but what's the catch, Lord?""

""Well, you can have him on one condition.""

""And what's that, Lord?""

""As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring ... so you'll have to let him believe that I made him first. And it will have to be our little secret...you know, woman to woman.""</i>

God is a woman according to the movie <a href=http://www.imdb.com/find?tt=on;nm=on;mx=20;q=dogma>Dogma</a>, so this is possible, right?

If you don't think so, you are only arguing with <a href=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/>Kevin Smith</a>, a producer of comedy films since 1992.  These films have specialized in sarcasm and have a nominal value according to film critics.  He has has had the pleasure of working with Jason Lee, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Alec Baldwin, Shannen Doherty, Claire Forlani, Salma Hayek, Jason Mewes, Stellan Skarsgard, Joey Lauren Adams, George Carlin, Chris Rock, Alanis Morrisette, Jennifer Lopez, and Charles Barkley, to name a few.  So who are we to judge Kevin Smith?"

"event","I will begin with the background.  I was frantic all weekend about a one-hour presentation I had to give.  It was originally scheduled for Tuesday and I was not really started with it on Friday at 3pm when my supervisor moved it to 11:30am on Monday!!  Ah!  So, this weekend I procrastinated like usual and did virtually nothing but take one typed page of notes on half of one chapter.  I was presenting on three chapters.  As of this morning at 8am, I had a title slide, and objective slide with one objective (define managed care), and a managed care definition slide.  I would need at least 23 more slides to fill up the necessary time.

I thought I had some good news - my supervisor was MIA - the other pharmacist said she had an ill infant (4 months old) and would 'probably' not be in at all.  I would present on Friday.  So, I went to my cubicle and worked my ass of to get it done.  I had planned on canceling the talk and begging the supervisor to let me present on Friday.  Turns out, she is coming in.  Thank goodness I had started working on it at 8am.  She calls me at 10am to tell me (in a very mean way) that I still have to do the presentation because she will be in on time.  She must be telepathic because I hadn't mentioned canceling it and she just knew anyways.

So, guess what?  I didn't finish reading the chapters, but I did knock off 22 more slides and filled the entire hour with the sound of my voice.  Am I good at winging it or what.  Both the supervisor and the other pharmacist loved it.  And this is the positive feedback for my negative behavior.  Procrastinate and be rewarded.

<lj-cut text=""The Day Got Worse!!"">The Day Got Worse!!

How could it, you might ask.  Well at 3pm it did get worse.  My supervisor has scheduled time with me to 'go over' the pieces of a project.  I am working on one piece and have no idea what the other pieces are that she mentions in her email.  She shows up and gets quiet when I can't answer her questions.  She is making me really mad because she keeps asking me the same things over and over.  She can't explain herself to me at all.  She threw some paper on my desk two weeks ago, and now I am supposed to have typed it and updated it.  I thought it was for my reference.  I said I couldn't find something and she put the answer on my desk.  Apparently she answers my questions with more questions.  Strange.

My mom got the brunt of it.  I called to her in a sad mood to tell her how my day was.  She called the pharmacist/supervisor a 'bitch', and this is why my mom is so great.  It was just what I needed to motivate me.  The supervisor left my office at 5pm (after 2 hours of sitting in my office), and I talked to my mom shortly thereafter.  Well, I left at 9pm feeling completely changed.  I completed the project she had been so vague on earlier - not to mention another project as well.  I emailed her at 9:02pm.  I told her I spent extra time in the office and would be in at 9 or 10am tomorrow to compensate for the extra 4 hours I spent at work.  Yay.  This cheered me up.  Not to mention the songs on the way home were perfect to lift my mood.</lj-cut>

And this is why I am an eternal optimist - I actually feel great now about the day.  Did I mention that I missed my lunch break and haven't eaten yet.  Oh, well, I am going to go do that now.  Ciao"

I love how the website is set up.  You click on a sale category, like T-shirts and sweaters under $16.99, then click on your size, and wow.  It lists all the sale items, styles, and available colors.  No searching through sale racks or bins for the size you need.  I got 3 t-shirts and something else nice.

I needed a t-shirt to replace the void in my wardrobe - I just ruined one t-shirt and one button down shirt for work in the laundry last weekend.  No big deal about the work shirt.  But the t-shirt was my most complimentary-fitting, every-so-adorable, summer-is-so-fun t-shirt.  I have only had it for about 2 months, so I was a little too attached to it just yet.  It was similar to Carrie having her very new, very favorite pair of Minolo's stolen.  Except the T was from Old Navy and probably cost me all of $9.99.  :)  I don't have $485 for a pair of shoes, so it is my only equivalent.

I don't usually listen to words of songs too much, but you just have to hear these words everytime this song plays.  Wow.  I am stuck in another generation of music I suppose as I listen to this:

"event","Well, this morning started off well enough.  I was craving breakfast but had not time to make my usual pepper bacon 'n' eggs or even Honey Bunches of Oats w/Almonds.  So, off to fast food I went.  I realized that I have been going to McDonalds, not BK, all these mornings.  One week before I started walking daily, I got breakfast 4 times that week there.  Hmmm...and I wonder why I don't lose weight.

<lj-cut text=""The Morning Customer Service Rant Starts Here!"">So, I go there, wait in the unusually long drive through line, order, pay, and go to the second window.  I get handed a very large orange type drink (Hi-C?).  I tell the woman I ordered at 12 oz. orange juice and hand it back to her.  She gives me my bag and the oj.  I note that I do have the right sandwich wrapper and do have a hashbrown; however, she decided to give me Picante sauce - the stuff for the breakfast burritos.  Ummm, ok.

I am on SW Tfwy about 8 blocks away taking my first bite of the sandwich when I realize it has no 'breakfast meat'.  Hmmm.  So I whip it around and go back to McD's.  I explain, she pitches the sandwich, and gives me a new one.  Hopefully with no spit or other unmentionable things.  It did take a whole minute or so to make which had me wondering.

But, no apology.  No, sorry you are going to be late for whatever you are going to this morning, maam.  No, have a good day.  No, have a great weekend.  No, sorry for the inconvenience.  No, well, I hope the rest of your Friday isn't as screwed up as we have been trying to make your morning.

Customer service sucks.  Once when I worked at Arby's I remember taking slack from a 'crew leader' over a customer.  I got a similar request - you forgot the tomatoes, or whatever.  I apologized to the woman.  Then, I took the sandwich without glancing even at the wrapper and pitched it.  I told the crew leader to make another, and he asked why I hadn't looked at it (like the McD's lady did to my sandwich today).  I said, I don't need to insult the customer because we already messed up once, and I don't intend on making her feel bad.""  I intended on feeling bad myself, instead.  I mean, either I messed up when telling the guy what to make or he messed up when making it.  She did nothing wrong. And even if she had, the least I could do is make her feel a little less mad by correcting it in a professional way.

It used to be a universal fact that ""the customer is always right"".  Not anymore.

Well, I think that I apologize for every little thing in my life even if it isn't needed.  So, I probably expect appologies a little too often and then look back saying ""hmmm, I guess I didn't need a apology for that"".</lj-cut>

On a side note, my Friday morning was turned around today by a simple thought of last night.  *smiles*  Still, no calls from my friends on LJ to see what fun I had.  I will give it a 24-hour window before I start calling.  Oh, I have to call my old roomie back because she left me a leading voicemail that I got this morning.  Yay, soon I can tell her all about it.

So, what reminded me of last night while all peeved and driving in my little car this morning?? Going through an intersection - Ward Parkway and 75th.  Now every morning and every drive home will have at least one cheeky grin because of that intersection!!"

"event","So, I came into work early today, so I am working 7:30 - 4:30 instead of 8-5.  I don't like it.  I would rather work 10-7.

My brain didn't start functioning until just now (9am) after a soda from BK and my second cup of coffee.  Maybe the fatty breakfast slowed me down.  Note to self:  no more Burger King breakfasts on days where I start early.

I slept like a doll baby last night....probably because I went to bed at a more decent hour than usual.  I think I had a pleasant dream, but I can't remember how it went.  Bummer.  All I know is I woke up with a big smile on my face.  Too bad it wasn't a Saturday.  I would have rather just lied there and keep smiling.  Nope, I had to shower and get my suit on.

I will have to take a project home today to finish so I may not get any sleep tonight.  I hate that I am a procrastinator.  Oh, well, I am what I am.

This presentation I am putting together is sure to be my worst.  Not because of anything within my control.  Don't get me wrong - it won't be bad - just my own personal worst.  <b>My audience?</b>  A pharmacist who has been practicing pharmacy for 30 years, who went back to get her Pharm.D. when it was an available option, who has been doing managed care work since the 80s; and a pharmacist who graduated four years ago, did managed care rotations, did a managed care residency at another company, and has now been working here for 3 years.  <b>My topic?</b>  An introduction to managed care pharmacy - pharmacy benefit management.  Oh my goodness - they are sure to be bored.  And the older of the two pharmacist falls asleep after any 10 minute period of straight lecture.  <b>My expected lecture time?</b>  45 minutes.  Oh, darn.  I should probably focus on something different.  At least the next presentations tie into a project I am doing.

Which brings me to the exciting fact that I now get to start that project - a diabetic disease management program - this is as close to a specific life-long career dream as I could get this year!  I am super psyched to start it.  And I will be sure not to procrastinate because I am so excited about it.  I am so glad I took this job!  Yay!"

I won an ebay auction.  My first bid ever was my first winning bid.  I can't believe it.  I won't tell you how much I bid because it is a very big number.  What did I buy?

<h2>Kansas City Chiefs Season Tickets!!</h2>
I can't believe I have them.  I bought them all for myself - two tickets.  I can take whoever I want and not have to charge a penny.  Why?  Because I want to.  I am giving Ernie first choice on which game he wants to come into Missouri for because he was planning on visiting and scalping us some tickets anyways.  I plan on taking my roomie to at least one game because she helps me remain a sane individual (use your own judgement to mock that sanity statement if you must).  I plan on going to most of the 8 season games and both of the preseason games.  I also plan on taking someone else, but I haven't told that person yet.  *giggles*

I will probably sell the tickets for the one or two games that I can't make it to.

Information on Histrionic Disorder:
People with histrionic personality disorder are constant attention seekers. They need to be the center of attention all the time, often interrupting others in order to dominate the conversation. They use grandiose language to discribe everyday events and seek constant praise. They may dress provacatively or exaggerate illnesses in order to gain attention. They also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves them. They are often manipulative.

I <b>do</b> seek attention by butting in conversations.  I <b>don't</b> dress provocatively or exaggerate illness/relationships.  I <b>do</b> say that boys on the street look at me when I jog, <b>but</b> then I make sure to note that most are just casual glances.  Neat test."

Mini Mexican Bean roll w/Salsa
Lobster Cream Cheese Dip w/Crackers (that's what I made; thanks for recipe, roomie)
Tortilla Chips Smothered in Bean Dip and Salsa

Mini Muffin-Shaped Blueberry Cheescake
Fruit Pizza w/Strawberries & Pineapple
Chocolate Brownie w/Vanilla Icing & Sprinkles
Strawberry Mousse

"event","Alright - this is for everyone with a car, truck, SUV, or other mode of transportation on which 'bumper stickers' may be affixed.

I don't like politics all that much, and I definitely don't like them at 7:30am on my way to work in the morning before my first cup of coffee.   So, it really annoys me to see any political bumper stickers on my way to work.  On my way home??  Go for it.  More power to you.  I especially dislike the morning sightings of ""Bush rules, Kerry drools"" types of political bumper stickers.  I mean - is it so necessary to create 'trashy' sayings to paint our vehicles with.

I once bought two small bumper stickers.  They said, ""Honk, if you like Peace and Quiet"" and ""My Other Car is a Golf Cart.""  I got out to my car and realized that these were funny at times, but they may come back to haunt me!  Obviously, I have a trashy side - that voice in my head that told me these would be 'cool' to put on my car.  And I will keep that side of me untill I die.  But, I just don't believe in any one or two messages enough to force the same messages down someone elses throat as they drive by in their more expensive BMW or Lexus.

This messaage of course cannot be taken out of the context of ""we have a first amendment right to freedom of speech.""  I obviously support it - because I am posting this morning vent session.  Y'all can keep you bumper stickers, and I'll just smile knowing that at least all bumper stickers stand for one core message:  ""I can say what I want!!""  I believe it!"

So, I am almost finished with the wonderful cosmo #2.  Wow - it is too smooth and has no taste of alcohol.  I just realized I forgot to eat dinner and am getting pretty wasted.  Oops.  Nothing I haven't experienced before - umm, like yesterday.

What I made:

Prepare the glass:

Rub lime slice around rim of super chic pink/purple martini glass
Dip into pink sugar to coat the rim with yummy pink ingredient
Twist the lime slice into the glass and drop in for decoration

Put 4 ice cubes in a shaker and add the following:

3/4 ounce Vox Vodka
3/4 ounce Ketle One
1.5 ounce Smirnoff Orange Twist Vodka
3.0 ounce DeKuyper Triple Sec
6.0 ounce Light Cranberry Juice

Shake and pour 1/2 mixture into the prepared glass

Come back later and pour the other 1/2 into the glass because the roomie is on the phone with parents and don't want to interupt her to drink when I could just as easiy handle the six shots of stuff my damn self!

Ok - it is official.  I finished the two drinks and I am making something else.  That list of my alcoholic beverages available calls to me - DRINK!"

Jealous?</b></center>

Yes, I have a great collection of everything alcoholic now.  Superb.  Dreamy.  To be lived up to.  <b>And, I share!</b> Here is what I have inventoried:

Any Cheese with that Wine:
Chateau Ste Michelle Syrah
Chateau Ste Michelle Pinot Grigio
Sutter Home White Zinfandel
Sutter Home Merlot
Sutter Home Chenin Blanc
RH Phillips Cabernet Sauvignon
Talus Chardonnay
Parducci Sauvignon Blanc
Beringer White Zin/Chardonnay
Beringer Founder's Estate Zinfandel
Livingston Red Rose (table wine)
Turning Leaf Riesling
Penfold's Kalimna Shiraz

Getting Drunk of the Liqueur I Drunk:
Ketle One (best cosmo vodka ever)
Smirnoff Orange Twist (second best)
Cointreau (best cosmo ingredient ever)
DeKuyper Triple Sec (cheapest cosmo ingredient)
Vox Vodka (overpriced cosmo ingredient)
Cabana Boy Pineapple Coconut Rum
Cabana Boy Wild Cherry Rum
(these are served in gay bars - but I had no idea)
Frangelico liqueur (chocolate cake shot = yum)
Goldschlager (the perfect shot before your last college final - yes, before!)
Regency Amaretto (the best cheap, yet smooth shot)
DeKuyper PeachTree Schnapps (everyone should have this)
RemyRed (a hint of cognac - powerful)
Hypnotic (another hit of cognac - less powerful)
Henessey (too strong for me - mix with above!)
Yagermeister (frozen for best results)

So, there it is.  I drink beer as soon as it hits my frig, so I won't count the Boulevard Wheat Bottles (KCMO) or the Flying Dog Wheat Bottles (Denver, CO).

"event","Lately, running feels a lot like sex.  So here are the Top 10 Reasons Running is like Sex:

10. It can get boring if you don't try out different locations.
9.  You can do it to the beat of your favorite songs.
8.  With a new partner, your speed may not be compatible.
7.  You may need a shower afterwards if it gets you really hot.
6.  You can get a real high out of it with the right pace.
5.  It can take you somewhere new where you didn't wanna go.
4.  It feels so good you could just scream - and you do.
3.  Even with a good friend, there are priceless moments of silence.
2.  It can make you hot and sweaty and glad that you did it.
1.  It feels so dirty when you are panting and someone else sees you.

That is my piece for today.

On a side note, I talked to Julie yesterday at work for an hour - I counted that as time spent 'networking'.  And she and Jon are doing great.  They just set a date for the wedding - October 15, 2005.  So keep your calendars open if you think she will invite ya!  I asked if she was inviting me, and she laughed.  She misses all of us and wishes you guys well.  I let her know how we (kappa psi's) are all doing as well.  She was very glad to her about eveyone - in a non-gossip kinda way, of course!"

"event","Remember when <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/drinkalizer/14866.html#cutid1>I was going on and on about a friend of mine named Melissa</a>?  She is the one who said I looked funny when I run in my shorts.  And I also said that she didn't mean any harm and all that jazz.

Well, I haven't talked to her in quite some time (2 weeks is a long quiet time for us two talkative girls).  But I know she has just started her new job, and a mutual friend told me that she is very busy and stressed.  She is now a professor at the community college she graduated from!  :)  Go 'super-accountant'!  And, well, she sent me a card today.  An ""I was just thinking about you"" kinda card.  I love those kinds.  Here it is:

<center>Front:<br><br>I watched an ant<br>climb a blade of grass this morning.<br>When he reached the top,<br>his weight bent the blade<br>down to the ground.<br>Then, twisting his thorax<br>with insectile precision,<br>he grabbed hold of the next blade.<br>In this manner,<br>he traveled across the lawn,<br>covering as much distance vertically<br>as he did horizontally,<br>which amused and delighted me.<br>And then, all at once,<br>I had what is sometimes<br>called an ""epiphany,""<br>a moment of heightened awareness<br>in which everything becomes clear.<br>Yes, hunched over that ant<br>on my hands and knees,<br>I suddenly knew<br>what I had to do...<br><br>Inside:<br><br><b>QUIT DRINKING BEFORE NOON.</b></center>

Note Inside:  Dear Jackie, This gave me quite a chuckle - thought it might brighten your day.  Love, Lissy

That is some funny stuff!  I miss going drinking with Melissa - taking turns at being the designated driver/babysitter.  What good times we had in the little city of Johnstown, PA.  At least I didn't puke in the parking lots - that was her job! :)"

"event","I just must be doing something wrong in life.  Why does my life revolve around calls to customer service of all the companies that I do business with.  Are companies seeking quantity business over quality business, nowadays?  Or am I just choosing the companies that have adopted this principal of $$ over customer satisfaction?  Are there so many administrative mishaps that are causing this increase in calls to customer service??  Is that what makes my hold time so long?  And if so, is the increased demand for customer service causing an increase in employment of less qualified or desirable candicates for the customer service positions?  I know that there is an increase in the need for customer service representatives.  This comes at a great cost for a business - when the need for CS grows faster than the need for the actual product.  Are consumers more demanding now that the economy has taken a hit (since 9/11)?  I know that I am.  My dollar doesn't go very far and I want something more for it.  I want a product and a good service.

This is probably going to be my longest ever entry, so don't feel obligated to see the whole thing.  I need to preserve these stories for my own well being and so I can laugh about it later.  But I am not laughing right now.  Nope, no smile here.

<lj-cut text=""For the Examples, Click Here."">So these are some examples, old and recent, that lead me to the above conclusions.  Sorry to bitch, but I told you that you didn't have to read this pessimistic mess.  You can stop now.  Ooh, well, here goes.

I tried to register for a meeting in December - one of the largest pharmacists meetings of the year.  I am very excited to go to Orlando, FL and see some of my friends from around the globe at this meeting.  I will also be interviewing with companies for a job that I will start on or about August 1st.  Exciting.  So, I go to the website, type in my member ID number and passoword for the organization I am a member of and continue.  I change my home address, my work adddress, my aternative address, and my phone numbers - the works.  Then, I sign up for the clinical pharmacist email news, a hard copy of a publication to be sent to me, and for the meeting.  All is going well.  The meeting registration is paid for by my company - at $160 for the week, I am glad I am not a non-member because then it would be $655 for the same exact registration.  Wow!  So, I fill out all of this billing address and credit card information and end up a the confirmation page.  Mind you that my bill should be $160 because the other stuff (newsletter/emails) are free.  The amount shown is $655.  I obviously don't click the 'go ahead and charge me' button.  I call a number listed on the website.  This directs me to a new customer service number (why can't I just hit a key to be redirected!!??).  So, I call there.  I hold for a while because the company is ""experiencing an extremely high call volume.""  Well, it is 9 something am - why the unexpected volume?  Who knows.  These are pharmacists - like me - so maybe we actually have the brains enough to not wait until 7pm to give the company a call.  So, the customer service representative asks me all kinds of strange questions.  Her: ""Please hold....(comes back with) Do you know why you got a free membership last year?""  Me: ""I didn't; I paid for it - $30 for a year at student rates."" Her: ""Please hold....(comes back with) I don't know why you couldn't use the website to register - it says here that you are a student non-member.  Ooh, wait, why does it say that.  Hmmm.  Please hold.... (comes back with) Well, I have to send this to a different department to fix it.""  Me:  ""Well, what exactly is getting fixed, just so I know what is going on.""  Her:  ""Well, I am not quite sure.  I just know that problems like this go to a different area.  They will contact you once the problem is fixed or with any questions (verifies my phone number at work)""  Me:  ""Yep, that is my number.  Is it in your computer system that I called and that the problem is being handled by this other area?  And what area is it going to exactly.  I just want to know in case I need to call back to customer service - so that I know what to tell them.""  Her: ""No, it isn't in the computer, it will just manually be sent to them.  All I can say is that a 'specialist' will have it. If they don't call you by noon on Monday, you can try back.""  Me:  ""And I should just say that a specialist has it, right?""  Her: ""Sure, that will probably work.""  End of conversation.  I can tell this isn't then end of my correspondence though.  In this case - there is no way around this umbrella pharmacy organization, so I am stuck dealing with them because they do have the largest pharmacist job fair in the world.  I really like have access to that job fair.  Fuckers.

I tried to set up a digital phone line at my apartment along with the cable service.  The cable and cable internet appointment was made promptly and finished quickly.  But because of my roommates and my work schedules, we were forced to schedule a phone appointment on a Saturday about 5 or 6 weeks after the call for the appointment.  This was compounded by the fact that our normally responsive landlord/realty company had not yet fixed our buzzer.  So, when the man/woman came to hook up the phone, 'no one answered'.  Well, I am not telepathic and didn't realize the buzzer still didn't work or that the representative was outside when he/she was.  So, another customer service call.  After a 20 minute conversation, the appointment is rescheduled for 3 weeks later - the next available Saturday appt.  She also credited my account $20.  A nice resolution in the end.

I tried to close an account with my old bank starting back in the first week of July and got a run around and excess charges ever since then.  I spent over one and one-half hours yesterday - on researching the problem, talking to three different associates, and typing a 2 page letter that I will have to send if it is still not fixed/closed after this week.  At one point this one customer service representative hung up on me and I had to call back (I get demanding on customer service calls and I am very sorry, but I never yell at anyone trying to help me.)  I had to document all of the transactions and conversations that I have had - documenting all the financial burdens and wasted time that I have spent on the issue. It filled up every bit of 2 pages in Word without any address, salutation, signature, etc.  And it will turn into three pages if I add all of this and add the finishing touches if the problem is not resolved.  In the end, I have someone at the local branch's name and phone number and address.  I am now redirecting all correspondence to her and then the fees will be credited from the last week's mixup.  She was the first too appoligize that it was taking over 4 weeks to close the account.  She was a great customer service person - even though this wasn't her job title - she was the branch manager.  Go figure.  I had asked the woman who hung up on me that I be sent an appoligy letter for all of the trouble I had been going through and she said, ""I dont' know what you want me to do.""  Well, I had just told her!!  I don't like to ask for verbal appoligies, so this was my case in point.

Last story.  I recently tried to avoid the company that I had problems with - my auto insurance company.  So, I look at the website for JD Power and Associates, among others, for customer service ratings of companies.  I find a super fabulous one who I have actually requested a quote through before.  Although my last dealings with them 6 months ago (the last time I shopped in a similar manner for insurance), I decided that they were #1 in CS, so maybe it was a fluke.  I don't think it is a fluke.  This must be who Jessica Simpson and Puff Daddy get to insure their vehicles.  My quote from my current company:  ~$760 for a 6-month policy.  For identical coverage with the super fabulous company with great customer service ratings all over the web:  ~$3100 for a 6-month policy.  I know, I can't believe it either.  I had two other quotes from popular companies - both between $1000 and $1100 for a 6-month policy.  I guess the moral of my whole entire life story is that I will never be able to afford good customer service.  That fucking sucks.</lj-cut>

Well, that sums up my recent annoying phone calls and correspondence.  The ones I remember anyways.  I need to sign up for a class that teaches me to surround myself with some positive energy or something. Maybe the really swell roomie can make me a tea or something.  Watch a video, read a book.  I am a usually very positive person with this tendency to take action after any little problem with a company I guess.  I need to learn to channel this elsewhere."

"event","So, it is a record.  Since the first spotting of the shirtless boy last Thursday, today marks day 6.  I have jogged 6 out of 7 days!!  I feel so proud of myself.  And the extreme adrenaline I get is now the new fuel for me to keep running every day.

I really got a rush from jogging today.  I did my usual route but backwards.  Today I ran up all of the stairs on the Memorial.  I think I saw the shirtless boy again - but from far away.  Who knows.  Then once I was over the Memorial and heading out the road, a guy got out of his blazer, stood there looking my way, and then he turned and dropped his pants.  So, to that guy - whoever you are, you have very cute baby blue-colored boxer briefs.  He knew I was running by but it didn't stop him.  He had a cute butt and his love handles were very squeezable.

Today is a very cool day.  I wanna see Little Black Book!!  Brittnay Murphy is a super fun actress and Nick Hurran isn't too shabby either.  Although, Sex and the City fans like myself know that he cannot commit!  Stacy - Derek isn't gonna committ, honey.

And just in case you needed one more embarassing factoid about me to poke fun of the next time we chat - I AM going to buy the Ashlee Simpson CD.  I have been watching the Ashlee Simpson Show so I could pick on her, but I like her music!  *squeaks*"

"event","I went jogging again today - but later than usual.  The Memorial was closed.  Some guard figure yelled at me to leave, but I was jamming to my music!  I saw a nice looking man running but it wasn't the same guy (and he didn't check me out either).  And, there were way more joggers out today from 8:15 to 9:15pm than my usual 7-8:15pm running time.  Hmmm.  Potential.  :)

I went to the Overland Park Arbotoreum and Botanical Garden (south of Overland Park Kansas).  This is a 300-acre, well, garden with paved trails and bark-type trails.  I didn't get to see much since I made one wrong turn, and it closed 30 minutes earlier than is posted on the internet (7:30pm not 8pm).  I will go back tomorrow with Liz.

I have now joined three new communities:  <lj user=malecelebrities> <lj user=movietalk> <lj user=kcsports>  First of all, I am into making desktop wallpapers now - with celebrities.  So, the celeb one is pretty good for me.  Secondly, I like actors - and movie talk is all about talking about the actors, films, producers, etc.  Way cool.  And, last of all - sports.  I love to watch sports live - including hockey, football, baseball, and basketball.  So, this will hopefully be a way for me to make friends who will go to sporting events with me.  Not that many members there, but I see potential (in the ones already there and the possibility of growth).

So, I am looking for someone to go to a baseball game with me.  My roomie Liz agreed to go to a game, but I want to hit up several games.  So, let me know if you are interested in any kansas city sports.  You (+ significant other or friends of course) are more than welcome to go with me.  I don't like the idea of going alone, but I also don't wanna spend another weekend doing absolutely nothing but jogging past the Liberty Memorial.  Let me know, pretty please!  Thanks.  You're swell."

I can't wait to go hangout and drink with Mark!!  I miss my guy friends from Pittsburgh, and this will give me a chance to catch up with one of them.

Either way it is like a half expense paid vacation (flight and hotel paid, not meals and shopping).

I got to jog again on Friday and again today.  Friday I went exactly at 7pm on the nose and went the exact same route as Thursday.  My night was not filled with happy stories of the reappearance of the shirtless boy from my previous night.  I have also not spotted him around the apartment complex, either.  So, I went again today.  I saw a guy lying in the grass in the shade of a tree.  It was hot, I was only walking, but I was still sweating a bit.  This guy seemed to be following me with his eyes.  I love getting checked out.  I use the term ""checked out"" loosely, and this category who checks me out includes many more random glances than actual interested parties.  Then on my swing by/over the Liberty Memorial, more glances.  *Score*  Then, as I ran twice around the small track below the memorial, more heads kept popping up over the rail of the memorial.  Perhaps these were the same ones who glanced my way when I walked by jamming to my MP3 player at the top.

So, as you can probably tell, I love to run or walk in public places.  In addition, I have a warped sense of the presence of 'eyes upon me'.

<lj-cut text=""And, Here is How I Know"">So, how do I know this?  I have been told.  I used to go jogging all of the time over the summer in my hometown.  I would run along a busy road for 2/10ths of a mile to get to a 2-mile-long smaller side street.  I would run the 4 miles and would feel very accomplished after all of it.  I didn't get many looks along this busy road - an occasional beep from a construction vehicle - perhaps.  Then, my cousin (and my supposed best friend), Melissa, drives by one day.  When I get home, I get a call from her and find out that she saw me running along the road.

She proceeded to laugh at my attempt at regular exercise saying that I looked funny in shorts and looked funny while I was jogging.  She went on to say that I probably thought that I looked nice because I was doing something good and being/looking athletic - but that I didn't look good.

<b>WHAT?!</b>  I didn't flip out because I usually bottle things up and don't generally get much accomplished by arguing with her in particular.  About a year later me and Melissa had a series of arguements - and to this day I have never brought up this extreme insult to her.  Still to this day I don't wear shorts outside of my apartment AT ALL, and I am forced to run in jogging pants even at the very warm Kansas City temperatures.  So, a word to the wise - if any of you even THINK that you see me running - please don't tell me that I look stupid.  I had to stop running outside for over a year due to this one comment and don't need another year setback in my routine that I have now restated.  I don't like replacing time outside running and feeling the air in my face with inside time with Billy Blanks and his freaking Tae Bo video.  Thanks for your support of my running up until now.  I am not usually this bitter, but I hope you can see my point in this case.  :)

Don't hate good old Melissa - she didn't mean to ruin my exercise routine - and I love her very much even after all of it.  But to my satisfaction - she doesn't have the balls or the body to attempt outdoor exercise or even go to a gym with people possibly looking at her.  Who has the larger self-esteem problem?  She does - which is why I don't judge.  Also, she has other problems I won't mention.  Ok?  Good.  :)</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""To see the Wine Stock Market Report, click here"">Wine Stock Market Report (WSMR): Wine bottle count was up from 13 to 16, and is now down to 15 today in recent news.  Liz and I purchased Parducci Sauvignon Blanc, R.H. Phillips Cabernet Sauvignon, and Talus Chardonnay.  After our night out Saturday, we drank the Sutter Home White Merlot til it was all gone.  Yum!  We are down to three bottles of Sutter Home now.  We are through trying to get rid of it.  We are now just trying new things and may even purchase Sutter Home again if it is on sale.  Sorry if this disappoints anyone.  I would rather spend my money on dates and pretty dresses.  *winks*  If you want to follow my version of the stock market report, just read my journal entries to follow.

I don't remember much after 1:20 am.  In the morning there was my computer - still signed on to AIM - and a half of glass of unfinished Chardonnay right next to it.

I drank a whole bottle of red and a whole bottle of white.  Then I blacked out and woke up on the toilet a little after 6 a.m.

I should be hung over.  But I feel great!"

"event","I am drinking wine right now.  One glass of Sauv. Blanc and one of Cabernet Sauv. is what I am up to.  Liz is cooking some quiche for work tomorrow - smells yummy!  I have so much to say today - especially since I haven't posted for over a day (this is a record for me).  So, I am appologizing ahead of time.

The most important story just happened:  I went jogging after work.  This brings me to the hot male I ran into.  He is cute, shirtless, and watches me run by - SCORE!!  So, I run home (getting beeped at by many trucks - he he) and get a phone call outside of my apt.  I sit down on someone else's stoop and chat a little.  AND WHO RUNS BY???  The same slender, hot guy - and he has a tatoo - even hotter.  He stops by my apt building door about 30 feet away and looks back.  My jaw must have been wide open because he smiled at me, and I smiled back. :)

Now, I will be motivated to run more than once a week - more like every day.  And I will be sure to take the exact same route at the exact same time, too!

I found out at work today that my ENTIRE annual salary is funded by a drug company.  This just so happens to be illegal for the health plan to fund my salary through a drug company which contracts with them.  So, the drug company pays the pharmacy school at UMKC who then pays me - who is working at the health plan.  This, apparently, is legal.  

So, I met employees of two drug companies today.  The one company (the one paying my entire salary) sent Scott from marketing.  My boss and our company have dealt with him for five years on a special project that is 'out of this world' GENEROUS.  The company is trying to get the word out that they are 'correctly prescribing'.  I can't tell you which company it is...but it is a good one.

The other company was just trying to sell our pharmacy on a medication - for using it off-label.  Then they ""don't know"" if their company is pursuing the other indications - the five other indications they were mentioning trials about.  There is probably a reason for not going for FDA approval.  The whole slide show was prefaced with the slide ""For Educational Purposes Only""!  (In pharmacy, this means - the rest may or may not be complete and utter bullshit - use your own clinical judgement.)"

"event","Today was a good day at work - free bagel in the morning with my usual free coffee.  I got tons done and got a return phone call from the Kansas City Area Development Council.  I am trying to promote my position (for the person who will take it over next July).  It is fun to learn about Kansas City so that I can brag about how great the city is (on paper) at the October and December career fairs.  Can't wait to go out and show my 'people-person' side!!!  So psyched.  I may need a tranquilizer from all the excitement of meeting new people.  Uh ooh!  :)

I am also the leader of my first meeting tomorrow - if my boss talks over me, I may just shed a tear - it is my turn to lead the meeting.  Plucky push the button.  Just kidding!  But I did work hard, so I am sure it will show.

For those of you who think I am psycho right now for caring so much - my boss's opinion is the ultimate.

<b>Why?  Because I am going to be job hunting in less than one year.</b>

My position is until June 2005 and that is it.  Then, her word of mouth along with my networking is all I have to show people that I am able to what I do better than anyone else.  I want to pick my job, not get stuck with what is left.  Who knows - maybe my current employer will hire me - <b>at a real pharmacist salary!!</b>

<lj-cut text=""To see the Wine Stock Market Report, click here"">Wine Stock Market Report (WSMR): Wine bottle count is up from 12.5 to 15.5 today in recent news.  Liz and I drank 1 1/2 bottles this weekend.  But now, after my grocery shopping trip, our count is to a record high.  And, Sutter Home is the brand on 7.5 of our bottles - that is less than half!  I purchased a Chateau Ste. Michelle Syrah - on sale for $10 from $12 - and a Beringer Founder's Estate 1999 Zinfandel - on sale for $9 from $12.  I didn't know Beringer made an inexpensive and a normal priced version of my favorite wines!  I also made a purchase based on a pretty bottle design inspired by <lj user=pittgrrl04>'s pretty purchase.  This Fortant De France White Merlot will probably be okay because White Merlot is my favorite blush.  And, old roomie - let me know how to make a lamp out of my new pretty bottle!  Soon, we will be rid of the bottles of Sutter Home. If you want to follow my version of the stock market report, just read my journal entries to follow.

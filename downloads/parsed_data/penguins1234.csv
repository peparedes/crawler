We burnt Austin Barto's picture in the year book becasue he is a loser and deserves to die!He is a meanie and you all should not believe anything he says. Speaking of  saying, Hana says that he is a manmom. Because he is GRRRRRRR!
Hahaha I cant believe I am saying this but I like Ryan Buccino! AHHHHHHHHH he is soooooooo hot! Wow I used to hate him with a firey burning passion but now it is the complete opposite of that! Well nothing really is new but that PDA rule sucks dick. I hate that I cant hug my friends. GOD what do they think we are going to do... Fuck in the hall?!?!!? No way. Im saving that for highschool. (that was an angry type) sorry Hana wanted me to put that! I cant even air hug someone without getting in trouble. That sucks. Did anyone read that letter that they sent home about the child molester that lives next to the school? Is anybody EXTREMELY distrubed by that or am I the only one? I gotta go but I will try and get on here until my AIM works again. Rather, I pay up my half ($150) to the guy who is supposed to fix it. HAHAHA!

Love,
Tashie and Hana

Hana loves Zach more than anyone in the world and more than anyone will ever know!

Hana Says:

Um I just got back from the movies with Cam, Kaitlin, Brittany, Spencer, Tyler, Jillian, Branden, Lexi, Melissa, Jaci, and Melissa Katzin. We went to see Cellular, that kind of sucked. It was an okay movie. Then we went to Starbucks and hung out a little bit. Today I went to Michaels (the store) and I saw this REALLY, REALLY hot guy. He was tall and had black hair and it was long in the front and short and spikey in the back. He had a white streak down the front of his bangs. It was awesome. Of course, he is no where near as hot as EVAN! I love Evan, by the way! Well, I really don't want to go to school tomorrow but I have to. I feel like I didn't do all of my homework and I am so worried that I will get in trouble. I have so many projects that I am so confused! Brittany and Livia and I really need to get together to work on our science fair project.&nbsp;I have a book report and Lit. Circles.&nbsp;and a math project too. I am SO overloaded!!!!!!!!!! Well, anyways I have to go because I have to eat dinner. I love Evan!!!</FONT></P>

"event","wOOt! That little 8 year old that I am staying with has been getting really annoying lately. She messes with my stuff and reads my little journal that I have and goes through my things! We went to the mountains yesterday and that was really cool! They were really tall and very pretty. It was freezing though...that is ok though. Anyways, you get to sit in this little lift thing and ride up! That was the best part! I was alone with peace and quiet for like 30 mins going up and 30 mins going down. Then when you get to the top you walk around and can take a path to the highest mountain and see a center with information...blah blah blah. We started to hike up there and while we did that the little devil was trying to jump on all of the big rocks. (The whole path is made out of rocks, and some are huge) Well, on to the good part! She didnt listen when we told her not to do that because she would fall and get hurt. She didnt listen of course...and she fell and scraped her knee! WOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO! This is what I have beed waiting for the whole time and it finally happened. It gets better. Later we visited a water fall on the way to the car. I had to take a picture with her in front of the waterfall so, we started walking up to the picture place. She, again, wanted to make it an adventure so she decided to jump on all of the moss covered rocks that are very slippery. Of-course, she fell, again. We all laughed because she started to cry. The water was cold and she is a baby...what can I say? She yelled the equivilant of ""shut the hell up"" to me and then she got a beating for it! I laughed and so did my uncle. We both thought it was really funny. Later, in the car she spilled her drink on herself and yelled shit! I died laughing and then my aunt called her (the devil) mom and told her what she had said that day and Hania (that is her real name) got another spanking. YESERIE JIM BOB! That was the best day ever! I really want to talk to all of you guys so comment on here! I have to go eat lunch/dinner now so byebye! I will try and update again today or tomorrow! Oh and kaitlin, I took a lot of pictures of the place we went yesterday so you can see it too! It was really pretty and I think you will like them! I miss you so much! I will call you when I can! LOVE YOU SO MUCH!


I miss Brittany!

I know that I sound mean when I talk about how the child getting hurt is cool, but if you were here in my place, you would feel the same. I promise!"

There are alot of people here wearing punk/metal things. It is really cool. I went to see Shrek 2 today (in Polish) and there was a kid with a Iron Maiden shirt on! It was so cool to see that in other countries, people are getting educated well! HAHAHA! Brittany, I miss you so much too! I want to run into swinging doors with you and totally mess up closets! It is so much fun to do with you! I dont know why yellow reminds you of me either...that is my new favorite color! wOOt! Hey, if anybody sees Lexi tell her to look on here for me ok? THANKS! Lexi, you are so cool! I miss ya like CRAZY and I am sorry that I never called you back! I really regret that now! Please forgive me! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Yesterday I went to see my dad's home town. It is called Zary! I saw all three of his houses and where he used to hang out and all of that! They even have, Melissa will like this, a Jewish club. It was made durring WW2 and all of the Jewish kids would go and hang out there! They had dances and stuff, it is really cool! My dad and aunts and uncles used to go all the time! OMG there is a street called ""The Quiet Street"" (roughly translated) I think that is so cool! Hey, Kaitlin, if you want to know some hot guys that I have discovered, type these names into Google: Mike Taylor, Leo Romero, Shawn White, Ryan Sheckler (you probably know him already though), and Cristiano Ronaldo. They are all really hot! I have a channel on TV here that is only Extreme Sports, which means, that they basically only show: BMX, skateboarding, surfing, mountain biking, inline skating, and the old X-games. It is so awesome! HOT GUYS GALOUR!(sp) I love it! I really miss all of you! When I was at the movies I wanted to cry because I always had so much fun when I went with my friends! Now, I was there with an 3 year old in and 8 year old's body and a bunch of jiberish coming at me! It sucked! I miss all of my friends! I really want to see some hot guys that understand what I am saying! I want to be home! Kaitlin, I took alot of pictures yesterday! wOOt! OMG there are these people here ( I havent actually seen them, but their work is everywhere) that like go around grafetting (omg I spelled that SO wrong) stuff all over the walls of everywhere! They say stuff like ""Polish Punks"" and ""Punk's not dead"" and ""Nirvana forever!"" and alot of A's on the walls! Like for anarchy! I am so happy! I just would actually like to meet some of them. They speak English, I know because of what they write, so I could talk to them. That would be so cool! Well, I am gonna go now! I love you all and miss ya'll like CRAZY!

""Lets kill the playlist all the same bands, so repetitious, denying us the freedom we deserve. Will someone tell me why we even listen? Airwaves are filled with repetition.

Well, I went camping somewhere in the country. I dont know exactly where but it was pretty cool. No one spoke english, of course. There was this dinky little cabin type thing and inside were two beds and a bathroom and a kitchen. It was pretty small but the only time I was in there was to sleep so it didnt really matter. There was a lake and that was pretty cool. You could take boats and ride around for a while...we didnt do that. I GOT A TAN! wOOt! That never happens to me! I am so proud! YAY! Livia will know exactly what I am talking about on that comment! My cousin is so lucky because she is going to Nice, France for a week to see my other aunt and uncle. I am kinda mad because that is my only chance to do something that I really want to do and they didnt pick their goddaughter to go with them...grrrrrrrrr! Next weekend I am going to Krakow-the biggest city in Poland! While I am there I am going to see the concentration camp....tear...it will be sad, I know, but I want to see it. I know I am going to cry. Everyone does... then we are going to another lake and are gonna spend like a weekend there and then I will only have one more week in POLAND! YES! I want to go home so badly. I will get back only one day before school starts so that will be weird...no time at all. I really miss Brittany! So fucking much! OMG did you know that in Poland there is a butter brand named LIVIA? I think that is just SOOOOOOOOOOO cool. Everyone here looks at me like I am a freak. I am that ""weird-American-girl"" who doesnt speak Polish...who cares, right? Yeah! Well, I have to go. My uncle is like a slave driver and he only lets me have one hour on the internet so times up! I miss everyone! I want my friends really bad! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Crying

Picking up the pieces of a life you've broken.
Stiching it together with the seams wide open.
 
You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot see at all.
You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot breath at all.

What do you do when you're alone? 
What do you do when no one's home?
What do you do when you're alone?
Out of control now on your own...

Never waking up, the alarm is broken.
Running in a dream and it's like slow motion.

You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot see at all.
You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot breath at all.

What do you do when you're alone?
What do you do when no one's home?
What do you do when you're alone?
Out of control now on your own...

Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone now?
All I need are the details,
Just to figure it out.

Is there anyone out there?
Is there anyone now?
All I need are the details,
And a map of your mouth...

You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot see at all.
You keep crying crying crying 'til you cannot breath at all.

What do you do when you're alone?
What do you do when no one's home?
What do you do when you're alone?
Out of control now on your own...

You can't break away what you cannot change,
You can't break away,
You can't break away.

You can't break away what you cannot change,
You can't break away,
You can't break AWAY!"

I love you SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much! This country is so weird, but cool. I am having so much fun. I went to see two castles and downtown Warsaw. Everything is so old. I went bowling but sucked at it! Girls, the malls here are really big and have a lot of neat stores in them, better than American ones. Lexi, I am sure that you have called me like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times and I am sorry for not picking up but my dad took my phone away! I can't believe that I am actually here! I don't know any Polish and so it is kind of hard to get around with-out trouble. My uncle and aunt are helping, plus my cousins speak english. So, it is not all that bad. I miss Brittany sooooooooooooo much! SWINGING DOOR!!!!!!!! hahahaha! I am staying with my little cousin, AKA Devil Child. She tried to break my arm off! It hurt really bad... Hey Steph, guess what? The coffee here is so much better than Starbucks and is like $.50 because they have Zloda not dollars. I got to see the Polish presidents house. It is really small compared to our prez's crib. There are a lot of really hot guys here, and some even speak some english! wOOt! I really miss you all and I will try and update this as soon as I can. I dont know how often I will be able to get on here but I will try. Leave comments and I will try and talk to you later! LOVE YA ALL!!!


I miss all of my friends and my momma and dadda!


Drew and Cooper- I miss yall the most, but you already know that! Hey, Cooper, are you going to my school next year? PLEASE DO!


How long I'll wait just to say goodbye. Ten different ways to enjoy this night.

14:: When's the last time you saw me?
15:: Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't?
16:: Do you think I could kill someone?
17:: Describe me in one word.
18:: Do you think our friendship is getting stronger, weaker, or staying the same?
19:: Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen?
20:: Are you going to put this on your livejournal/xanga and see what I say about you?


Ok so take that and send it to me! Thanks Jaci!

I think that Zach Webster is the hottest guy on the planet!

"event","YAY! Kaitlin I updated! Aren't you just SO proud of me?!?!?

Okay so alot has happened since I last updated this thing! For starters Michael and I are back to being friends! We are better friends than ever! YAY! So, that means that Lexi can stop jumping on him and beating him up when she sees him! LOL!
Thanx for all the people who cared about me! :)

This is what Michael wrote in my yearbook! (sorry about the spelling or any mistakes there might be...)

""Hey Natasha,
Its been really great seeing you this whole year! Last year we barely talked, but now thats all changed. I had a great time learning all the music knowlege that you taught me. We had many fights, even our biggest one. Counselor...but, lets put all that in the past and go on a new journey in the future together. Damn that sounded corny. We should really hand out some during the summer. Natasha Allen. Sorry I just had to put that. I think I have turrets. I'm signing diagonaly. OK. I love you SO much. 
Love, 
Michael Dunn

Nice and noble
Always lovely
Totally awesome
Attractive
Sweet
Heavenly Angel
Attractive again

I had a great time this year!
I love your personality and traits (I dunno)!

Natasha is music to my ears.
Natasha is the joy of my life.
Love,
Michael Dunn, again. I'm finished.


ShoutOuts:

Lexi- BRING FOOD! Late night phone calls! Drew is so hot! Of course he is not sleeping Natasha, what normal person is sleepling at 12 at night? Maybe if we hide under the water she wont find us! Do you have a sister? Are YOU my sister? Your whole bathing suit is TOO small, Olivia!

Brittany- Lezzo flying bears! Bubble wrap! Hot-dog pancakes! YES! Block Buster! Bring the towels! Sarah are you there?

Melissa and Steph- RUN.TRIP.FALL.OWWWWWWWWWWW!!! haha GREAT school memories!

Michael- what is Guns n' Roses? how bout ACDC? Metal not hard rock! DUH! haha are you contageous? NO!

"event","<P>Today sucked, really bad. So it all started with Michael Dunn...he said I was rude and&nbsp; that he didnt want to be my friend anymore. He used to be my best friend, but not now he isnt. I will give him space I guess, only, he is turning all of my friends against me (or trying to). Then I was talkn to Ms. Bartley about all of the shit going on in my life and I slipped up and told her about me cutting my self. Then she said that ""by law"" she had to tell my parents. I am was so mad. So anyways, I had a long talk with my mom and dad about my suicidal thoughts. It was so boring, and stupid. My mom wants me to go to counciling. FUN! not.. I told her that I havent done it for like 3 weeks and she said that all that matters is that I did do it. What ever it is all so fucked up. I had an even worse day because I cant go to Brit's party and Michael is gonna be at Mel's party tomorrow. WEEEEEEE! It will be interesting...maybe. Well I g2g! LOVE ALL OF YOU!</P>

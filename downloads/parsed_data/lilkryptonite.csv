in the gental sound
floating with the words
my chest starts to pound
caugt within the silents
of the pleasent words you speak
Within each givin sentance
a hidden message i do seek
I love you not for what you are
or who u tend to be
The picture in my heart of love
Its  only you i see...
and i love you for a thousand reasons
yet you love me for more...
never have i betrayed you 
like the girls u had befor
And even tho this wisper 
has stole away my voice
a kiss is mearly givin
givin to you by choice
no fear is in your eyes
no tears no lonly crys
caught in your wisper
your secretly styled love
Now i kno where angels come from
your deffenitly from above..
And dont ever hurt if you see my tears
There only crys of joy"

id never hesitate to run away
And i try so hard to break away
but dispute how hard i try 
i only come back to sit and cry
i spend the days away from you
my friends they try to see me through
stuck in a house full of hate and pain
yet sum how you find me to blame..
dont hit me again or im gone for good
Finally livin out all that i should
broken home and broken hearted
a smiles shown when we are parted
cry no tears for what you've done
its cause of u <big><big>mom<small><small>This is what ive become



-maybe im just the reason.. but im to ashamed to admit it-"

"event","ok heres somthing i found in my drawer that i wanted everyone to see!



Misundeerstood/

You hurt me and brought me to the end
all because you misunderstood me
I took what you said and tryed to make it bend
But i couldn't cause u misunderstood me
I wanted to push forward away from it all
but u held my to close because u misunderstood me
Nobody seemed to hear my call
all because they misunderstood me
When i asked them to stop they hurt me more
all because they missunderstood me
They keept at it and i tore
all because they misunderstood me
soo can you be the first to try
be the first to understand me


i remeber when i wrote that and i remeber how i felt i felt like all because people missunderstood me they never cared about me but i learned now that being misunderstood can't hurt me any more now i laugh it off.....you can't hurt me because in order to u have to understand me! soo there for i am sayin dont try to get me mad ur wasting ur time don't try any more to hurt me i only see good now in being misunderstood.

"event","ok i got an idea from a friend of mine to tell u how i feel through a couple of songs here they are



Just when you thought it was safe to think,
in comes mental piracy!
What I'm looking for cannot be sold to me.
I wish they all would stop trying
************************************************
I see you in line, dragging your feet
you have my sympathy.
The day you were born, you were born free.
That is your privilege.
****************************************************
Say what you will, say what you mean.
You could never offend, your dirty words come out clean.
Tomorrow, what price will I pay?
*****************************************************
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal.
But lately I am beginning to find that
I should be the one behind the wheel.
****************************************************
Hit the ground 
Weighed down again 
You walked out 
But I'm sure you're my friend

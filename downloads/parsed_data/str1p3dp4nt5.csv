"event","I just watched Batman: The Dark Knight on tv. It reminded me of what an awesome movies it is. It inspired me to make a list of movies that I want to own. 

So here goes: Batman Begins, Batman: The Dark Knight, all Pixar movies, O Brother Where Art Thou, Spiderman 1&2, Ironman 1&2, Sweeney Todd, Transformers 1&2, Lord of the Rings series, Rodger Rabbit, 300, King Arthur, Troy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Phantom of the Opera, Public Enemies, The Simpson's Movie, The Spongebob Movie, Great Outdoors, Monty Python Holy Grail and Meaning of Life, Green Hornet (when it comes out)

And just so you know, here's a list of movies that I like and we have: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Wolfman, Ghost Rider, Zombieland, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Alice in Wonderland, the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Elf, Fantasia, and Fantasia 2000 

If you noticed any good movies that I missed and think should be on the list then comment with your additions and I'll think about it. That is, of course, if anyone is still bothering to read this. No one else has posted in a super long time.
 
On a side note. I remember the time when listing stuff in a sentence how before the last item you were supposed to use a comma and the word 'and'. Now it's socially acceptable to just use the 'and' without the comma, which bugs the crap outta me, but I'm trying to comply.

And on another side note, I've really gotten into some of the anime stuff on Adult Swim, especially InuYasha. I've watched all of the episodes and the 4th movie on Hulu.com. I've also read a lot of fanfics online. I'm only slightly obsessed. I'm debating on how I'm going to watch the first 3 movies. They weren't on the instant Netflix, but I could rejoin for a month or 2 so I could watch them without having to buy the darn things. I guess it depends on how much I could find them for on Amazon. I don't know if I could watch them and get all 3 back in just one month, so if I could get all three for under $20 then I might go ahead with it. I don't know."

"event","So, married life is interesting, well, at least the hours are. We're on day shifts for now, so we have to get up around 3 AM. Danny gets home at 6ish PM and we go to bed around 8 PM. Well, I got on LJ to update my status when I saw that my user pics hadn't been changed in a while. So I did that, but halfway through I started getting error messages while trying to upload new pics. So now I'm annoyed with LJ and don't really feel like posting now. But I'm going to keep going anyways since I'm tired of seeing my pre-wedding post. Before the wedding I was watching a lot of wedding shows like Say Yes to the Dress and such but now that the wedding is over I have no patience for that kind of stuff.

OH MAN!!! There's this show on Animal Planet called Fatal Attractions that I absolutely LOVE!!! It's about people who own dangerous wild animals and keep them as pets when the animals turn on the owners and attack. Anyways the new season is coming out the 8th of October. So, I'm excited.

So I got a new phone and have unlimited texting now so that's cool. So if you have texting and want to talk then that's cool. If you have texting and don't know my number and want to text then write me a message on facebook and I'll give you my number or whatever. 

So, what's up? Not much here, just waiting for my laundry to get done so I can put it away and then maybe take a nap. I like naps. Especially with the whole getting up at 3AM thing. On the night shifts I rarely need a nap since I'm more nocturnal anyways. So getting up at 3 PM and going to bed around 8 AM doesn't bother me as much as 3AM and 8PM. Ug, I guess I'll go check the laundry. Peace out yo!"

1) My throat is still messed up from my allergies
2) Was busy and stressed out at work;we had double the projected customers with no extra help
3) Dropped someone's food at work 
4) Had a different customer yell at me and make me cry

"event","A special thanx goes out to Danny boy for making the last 5 days amazing!

We went places and did stuff and it was awesome, especially Friday's trip to Steve and Kristina's where rock band and his family were a major component of the fun and yesterday's pizza, movies, and alcohol festivities!

The more I think about it the more I want to put in my 2 weeks notice early and go up and help Danny move my stuff into his apartment in July. I'm trying to decide if working the extra month would be a better idea. Having money is a good thing, but my parents are paying for more of the wedding than I previously thought they could. So, financially I prolly could go ahead and move up there early. I guess Danny and I will have to discuss it more. 

Also, on a side note, I'm trying to talk Danny into getting us a sleep number bed. My bed I have here at home is about 19-20 years old. I can never get comfortable in it and I always wake up stiff and achy. They aren't as expensive as I thought they'd be either! So, if you have any positive input that would help out my case then feel free to post a comment, maybe he'll see the light!!! :D

Ug, I should mow the lawn on Wednesday, but I hate mowing the lawn cuz I always get hand blisters and it takes me about an hour and a half and I get totally exhausted. :( I don't want to do it but I'll feel bad if I don't do it and make dad do it. Maybe I'll be lucky and it'll rain.

Danny uses it and said he really liked it, but for some reason it wouldn't download and my laptop said to retry so I did but it still didn't work. After that, explorer kept saying the it had errors on the page and would close.

So I ran a spybot scanner and it didn't turn up anything. Then I ran the disc defragmenter and it seems to be ok now but we'll see. 

Hopefully there's nothing wrong with my laptop now.

"event","So a couple weeks ago my sister, dad, and I were watching this show on the Discovery Channel about the Bermuda Triangle. These scientists and theoretical physicists were theorizing why all those disappearances have happened and stuff. 

The scientists were saying that the boats and ships were disappearing because of rogue wave which are caused by two sets of waves converging from opposite sides of the island. These waves are about 50 times the size of regular waves and can occur in any weather condition.

Then the show discussed the disappearance of 5 navy planes over the bermuda triangle in 1945. These planes had 2 types of navigation and it wasn't supposed to be possible for them both to fail: but they did. Evidently that same day 3 or 4 communications towers had sighted 5 unidentified planes directly over Florida well before those 5 planes should have shown up; however, they were on the same flight path as the missing ones had last been. They theorized that those were the same planes and they had been lost, ran out of fuel, and subsequently crashed in a government restricted swamp in Georgia.

A recreational pilot in the 1980's had a unique ordeal when he flew through the triangle. As he was flying, the weather got worse and fog and clouds had started to obliterate his view; so he headed toward a tunnel he had spotted. When he entered the tunnel, it appeared to be about 10 miles long. Odd things started to happen. All of his electrical components failed along with his other magnetic form of navigation and he noticed the clouds had turned an odd shade of yellow with a dark spiral lining the entire length of the tunnel. About 20 seconds later he was out and in open skies. Most of his electrical equipment was still malfunctioning along with his navigation systems. His radio was now operational so he called the nearest ground control to find his location. He then learned he was flying over Florida. He was dumbfounded to learn he had flown about 300 hundred miles in about 20 seconds. His small aircraft was only supposed to go around 200mph at maximum, however this new information meant he had flown about 2000mph. 

The theoretical physicists had speculated that black energy had created a time warp and that this pilot had flown through it. They explained that black energy is pretty much like gravity
except that it pushes instead of pulls. and that the combination of gravity and black energy had caused a ripple in time allowing him to travel the same distance in an extremely short amount of time. They explained how this black energy occurred, but I don't remember what they said.

The pilot was confounded and by his experience and researched the experiences of other pilots that had went through the triangle. He had found a book that talked of another pilots experience that exactly duplicated his own. The book was published in the 70's however the pilot had experienced it in the 40's or 50's but didn't want to sound crazy so he didn't admit his experience until much later.

Anyways, the show was called Bermuda Triangle Exposed and is replaying on March 25th at 8 and 11PM on the Discovery Channel. I encourage you to watch it for yourselves. IT IS AMAZING!!!"

I mostly just dress my avatar, but now that I'm pretty much out money I don't know what I'll do...maybe try to be less akward and more social? Part of my problem is that it's difficult to joke around or be sarcastic without people thinking you're being serious and a jerk. *sigh*...

So Craig Ferguson's book American on Purpose has evidently been out of print for a while. So I tried to order it from Barnes and Noble with a gift card I got for Christmas. This was January 2. Today I got an e-mail from them saying that the order was canceled and the amount was put back on my gift card. This was very upsetting because I really wanted that book.

I finished Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters today. It was a really good book. It makes me want to reread the original. I still have a couple other new books I need to read first though.

Kristen made brownies today and they were great. I ate them all. Well I didn't, but I should have.

A special thanks goes out to Kim for getting me interested in imvu. It's awesome!

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forbodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

I think it's marvellous! HaHaHa!"" 

Yup awesome song. I wish I had a lunatic in my head. But it's just me. :(

I killed a huge spider in the basement last night and it really scared me cuz I don't know how I didn't step on it when I walked by it and all of a sudden it was just THERE. It must have been about an inch in diameter from leg tip to leg tip. IT WAS SOOOOOO GROSS!!!!!

How was your Thanksgiving? I had to work from 12-9. So mine kind of sucked.

I'm kind of freaked out because today when I was driving to work I somehow managed to miss the turn off to go to Frankenmuth on Dixie Highway. First of all I couldn't remember passing it and when I realised something wasn't right I was already going by the cement making place which is almost a mile past the turn off. Second, I have no idea if I ran the light at that intersection or not. So, I'm glad I didn't die from not paying attention.

I like how it looks like I wrote a lot but most of it's either about me killing the spider or me thinking of something to tell you about. I love it.

That thing I was going to say earlier was just that I want to see the movie Fantastic Mr. Fox because it looks cute. And...here's the trailer for those who haven't seen it/want to see it again.

I apologize in advance for the commercial in the first ~30 seconds of the video. And if you can't understand what he's singing...well, that's because it's in German. :D So here are the lyrics.

Ooo rock me Amadeus
Rock me Amadeus...
Rock rock rock rock me Amadeus
Rock me all the time to the top

He was a Punker
And he lived in the big city
It was Vienna, was Vienna
Where he did everything
He had debts, for he drank
But all the women loved him
And each one shouted:
Come on and rock me Amadeus

Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus

He was Superstar
He was popular
He was so exalted
Because he had flair
He was a virtuose
Was a rock idol
And everyone shouted:
Come on and rock me Amadeus

Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus

Come on and rock me Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus

It was around 1780
And it was in Vienna
No plastic money anymore
The banks against him
From which his debts came
It was common knowledge
He was a women's man
Women loved his punk

Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus

Come and rock me Amadeus...

Baby baby do it to me rock me
Baby baby do it to me rock me
Baby baby do it to me rock me
Yes yes yes
Baby baby do it to me rock me
Baby baby do it to me rock me
Baby baby do it to me rock me

Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus...

"event","So, Danny and I went to see District 9 Friday and it was great. Lots exploding people, if the explosions didn't look so fake then I'd say it was extremely graphic, but it didn't look very like they did some kind of freeze frame took away the actor and then put in an explosionbetween the two. Then he bought me a jacket from Old Navy. It's yellow and extremely fuzzy. Then we went to Lucky's to eat. We had calamari (octopus) for an appetizer. It was sooooooooo good!!!!!!!  I love octupuses, and not just as food. I'm actually thinking about getting a tattoo of an octopus...maybe even an octopus fighting a crab or something. But, I can't decide if that would be what I want on my body for the rest of my life. It sounds cool now though. I had a key lime martini and that was pretty good too. 

Ilove how that last paragraph doesn't really flow at all and all my thoughts are kind of jumbled together.

We have this new alcoholic drink at work which one of my supervisors made samples of and let one of the cooks and I try. It's called a gummey bear and it was super good and actually tasted like a gummey bear. One of these days I want to go up there and have one of those and a red lightening lemonade, cuz those look good too.

Ok, I'll update more later."

I worked for 11 hours Saturday and made ~$200 in tips; then Monday I worked for 4 hours and made only ~$16. Monday one of my customers ended up breaking his tooth on a piece of chocolate...random. I figured he was going to say their as a bone in his dinner or something, but no, it was his dessert. And there wasn't even any nuts or anything hard in the piece of chocolate he broke his tooth on.

So we have these gross beetles around the yard eating our plants so for the past month or so we've been using these weird bag like traps for them and I have to clean them out most nights since K won't do it and mom usually is doing something else. They smell weird and are nasty.

Danny and I went to see The Orphan a while ago. It was kinda good, but pretty weird. I want to see 9. It's a Tim Burton movie, so I'll probably like. I just got the sudden urge to watch Sweeney Todd!!

I broke down and bought Pride and Prejudice and Zombies last night. I haven't started it yet, but soon...soon."

"event","So, as some of you may know, I'm not really doing too much wedding planning yet, just gathering ideas and whatnot. For instance, I've been to davidsbridal.com and have looked at bridal gowns and bridesmaids dresses. I've found one of each that I like, but...of course...the wedding dress I found was one of the most expensive on the website. Ug, how annoying. And I'm still not sure about the colors I want. I'm only having two bridesmaids and groomsmen...two of each if you were unclear about that.  Also I still have no idea where to have the wedding and reception. I was thinking that Stepping Stones Falls would be awesome, but if the wedding is going to be in October then that might not be a good idea. I've pretty much decided that I don't want the usual music for going up and down the aisle though. Danny and I decided that this song would be pretty cool for the beginning though. 

<lj-embed id=""22""/>

But I don't think anyone would take us seriously after that, so we decided against it. Teehee!

Anyways, for any of you that has a serious sweet tooth and can handle vast amounts of chocolate with no problems should go to Dairy Queen and get one of their new Midnight Truffle Blizzards. They are extremely awesome and I plan on obtaining my third one tonight!!!"

So, I'm thinking about getting another piercing. I already have 4 in each ear, so I don't think I'll have room for anything non-cartilage. But my ear is too folded over at the top, so I'd have to get it about a third of the was down my ear. I think it would look weird to get both of them done though, and since it is a cartilage piercing, it'll hurt more than the usual flesh piercings.
If I don't want it later on in life I can just take the earring out and the hole will close up eventually. It's not expensive, only about $15-25 depending on the type of earring I choose. I usually don't have problems with infections, so I'm not worried about that. Hmmm...what do you guys think, should I go for it?"

Good news: Kathleen...my roommate is now addicted to the Twilight series and is reading the second book now.

Bad news: Today was...annoying. So I had set my regular wind up alarm since my phone was dead and charging in the living room. So when it went off it scared me into an almost heart attack because it's so freakin' loud. So anyways I laid back down to calm myself before trying to climb out of my bed which is the top of a bunk bed. I ended up falling back to sleep for another 2 hours. So I was pretty mad because I had wanted to get up early to work on my lab report that was due during lab at 3. So I got up and was reading Twilight while eating breakfast when I noticed that it had taken me an hour to eat because I kept getting distracted by the book. So at this point I had about 2 hours before I had to catch the 2:10 bus to go down to campus. Miraculously I finished and did the prelab assignment for the lab that we were doing this week about 10 minutes before the bus came. So I e-mailed myself the files so I could print them off. But when I got on campus and opened the files, I realized that I had sent the spread sheet instead of the actual Word document. UG! I was going to go back to my apartment, but I only had a half an hour before lab started and it usually takes me 20 minutes just to walk up the hill to my apartment and another 15 to walk back.  So anyways, I went to lab...which ran an hour over!!! Thankfully, my TA said it was ok just to e-mail the file to her. So now I should be studying for my exam tomorrow night, but I don't feel like so it wouldn't do any good even if I did decide to study.

The website said that renting the rooms in the castle was &quot;affordable&quot;, but the one that was available that I liked was over $6ooo!!! I don't see how that's reasonable, but okay, whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />I've had this urge to draw last month, but I never had time and when I did I didn't feel like it, so now I still kind of want to draw the idea I had, but I just lack the motivation. *Sigh* <br /><br />So, yea. Okay, I'll warn you now, the next paragraph is all about the Twilight series, so if you aren't interested in them, then you might as well skip it.<br /><br />I'm still pretty addicted to the Twilight series. I've read each the 4 books at least twice. I hijacked my sister's copy of New Moon (the second book) which is her least favorite and probably my favorite. I like the depressing mood of most of the book. I don't know if I really want to see the movie when it comes out since I heard that they were changing it. My second favorite would be Breaking Dawn. There are so many plot twists in that one it's awesomely exciting! My third favorite is Twilight. I never did see the movie. I'm debating whether or not I should. Kristen said that the acting was really bad and that they left a whole bunch of stuff out. For the people who have seen it...what do you think, should I see it or would it be wasting my time? Then Eclipse was my least favorite. Don't get me wrong, I do love the book, but it's just not as awesome as the other three in my opinion. I just don't know how the movies would be, the author reveals a lot of info through Bella's thoughts and if the movies aren't from her first person views, then I don't see how she'll still portray all of the revelations that Bella goes through. I just can't see it being as awesome as the books.<br /><br />I've been getting pretty into this web comic called Two Kinds. It has a pretty good story line, but you have to get used to how the author sets up the order of the frames. It can get weird sometimes.  If you have a lot of time to waste, then here's the first comic so you can go in order.<a href=""http://twokindscomic.com/?p=1""> twokindscomic.com/</a> <br /><br />Well, I guess that's it for now.<br /><br />NOTE: Brown sugar is really good with unflavored applesauce.<br /><br />"

"event","So, I saw this add on facebook for places to have weddings. Anyways I saw this place in Charlevoix (around the Traverse City area, you know...the pinky finger of the mitten). 
<img src=""http://www.michiganstatewebsite.com/images/michigan-county-map.jpg"" />
The place is called Castle Farms and it's an actual castle!!!

It looks expensive, so I contacted them today to ask about rates and what not. Here are some of the courtyards and rooms I'm interested.

This is the Queen's Courtyard, what I thinking of for my ceremony. This isn't my favorite yard, but I like the reception area that goes with it!

<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/Wedding-Ceremony/images/Ceremonies/Queen%27s%20Courtyard/Queen%27s%20Court%201.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

This is the reception area that goes with it. It's called the Queen's Royal Tent. This is my favorite reception spot from the pics. I don't think I'd go with yellow, but you get the picture.
<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/wedding-reception/images/Queen%27s%20Tent/yellow%20tent%202%20edited.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

That's what I'm considering anyways. I doesn't look affordable like it says on the website, which is http://www.castlefarms.com/Weddings-in-Michigan/ , just in case you wanted to check out the other ceremony and reception spots. There's the King's courtyard for example and it has a giant chess set in the middle of the yard!!! Here's a pic! 

This is the Knight's Courtyard, this one's my favorite place for the ceremony.
<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/Wedding-Ceremony/images/Ceremonies/Knight%27s%20Courtyard/Knight%27s%20Courtyard%202.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

This is the Knight's Castle, it goes with the Knight's Courtyard. I like this one for the reception, but I like the tent better.
<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/wedding-reception/images/Knight%27s%20Reception/Knight%27s%202.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

Then this is like my last choice for the ceremony, it's called the King's Chapel Room.
<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/Wedding-Ceremony/images/Ceremonies/King%27s%20Indoor%20Chapel/King%27s%20Indoor%20Chapel.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

Then this is the reception place that goes with it, the King's Great Hall.

<img src=""http://www.castlefarms.com/ThumbnailViewer.axd?FilePath=/Weddings-in-Michigan/wedding-reception/images/King%27s%20Great%20Hall/K%20Great%20Hall%202.jpg&ThumbnailWidth=400px&ThumbnailHeight=300px&MaintainAspectRatio=True&AddWhiteSpace=False"" />

It's an option anyways. Plus, it doesn't look as affordable as the website says. Here's the website if you want to check it out for yourself http://www.castlefarms.com/Weddings-in-Michigan/ . Oh, and the King's Courtyard has a giant chess set in the middle of the yard! Here's a pic!

Then we came back to my apartment and watched tv and then watched Red vs Blue on youtube. Then Saturday we went to see Jeff Corwin who happened to be visiting campus. We ended up deciding to go all last minute like. We had bought the tickets the day before the show. Usually we buy them about a month in advance. So it was awesome and he brought a 2 foot long toad, a snapping turtle, an alligator, a Gaboon Viper (<lj-cut text=""here&#39;s a pic"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Gaboon_Viper_(rhinoceros)_01.jpg</lj-cut>)(and if you're wondering...they're all fat), and an albino Reticulating Python. It was a pretty darn good show! Then we went out to have a bite to eat...some mozzarella sticks and dessert. Then we went back to his apartment and played halo. I was kicking butt the first couple games then I went down hill from there. Sunday wasn't all that great, mostly homework and grocery shopping, but I did play halo again that night too. But I was really sucking it up. At one point in time I was attacking my own team member before someone pointed out to me what color I was.

Also this weekend I found out that I have a PHD in crazy!!!!

So this coming weekend, we're going to a hockey game then next Monday Danny, some of his friends, Kathleen, Mary, and I are going to a Relient K concert. Yay!!! Our team will probably lose because they almost always do when Danny and I actually go to a game. But that's ok...they sell ice cream cones at the games, so I'll be happy either way. I don't know if you guys are all that familiar with Relient K, but here's one of their songs...

"event","In a week and 2 days Danny and I will have been together for 3 years. Looking back on it, it doesn't seem like it's been that long. I've learned a lot about him and have even realized some interesting little quirks in my personality. The times have been good to us and have brought a good amount of joy but some anger, sorrow, and frustration also. This is of course to be expected. However, seeing as the love and happiness has far out-shown and outnumbered the not-so-pleasant times, I believe things are working out in our favor. I also feel that as long as we continue to communicate and work with one another we can maintain a strong and lasting relationship. 

There are a few things that concern me. As you may know, Danny's last year of school is well on its way, while I still have until the end of 2009 yet to go. Since we are in totally different fields I'm not sure how us both having a career (potentially in different parts of the country) will affect our future together. I shouldn't worry about this too much though because I believe that if we were meant to be together we will find a way to work around this... with the help of God of course. I am however still seeking the token that proves him serious about our future together, meaning an engagement ring. There is still plenty of time for this I keep telling myself, but I'm getting quite anxious with his graduation date continuing to draw near. In his defense however, I will say that in this little town in the middle of nowhere, he would have a difficult time finding one that would suit me. Also, even with the nice payments he had been receiving from his internship at the mine, he still had to pay for gas, school, and the continuous problems with his Blazer. All of this would certainly not help his situation and have the same effect on mine. 

I'm getting to the point in my life where I just want to start settling into a career, a marriage, and long and healthy life. I don't want to stay in school anymore, but I've come way too far to just quit. I want the next chapter in my life to begin. I'd give a lot to be able to curl up with him at the end of a long work day and just relax and talk and eventually fall asleep next to each other. I know it will be difficult perhaps even most of the way, but I believe that it will be worth it...he will be worth it. 

Here's a song that's been running through my head a lot lately...it pretty much describes everything perfectly.

<lj-embed id=""13""/>

It's nights like tonight that hurt the most. It's late at night and you're wide awake and lonely. You can't help but realize how much you need and care for that one special person. You can't get them out of your mind but thinking of them makes you all the more lonely and the pain only drives deeper into your heart and sole until your sobbing from it. And still the relief of sleep is out of reach.

Other than that, I haven't been up to too much of anything. Mostly the odd homework assignment, I have an exam tomorrow in my economics decision analysis class. Then there's been mouse hunt on Facebook. That's fun. It's all about buying cheese and traps and trying to catch different types of mice, the more difficult or rare ones win you more experience points and gold. It's an awesome game. So...you should join the hunt, because it's addicting. And just in case you didn't see the video I posted on my FB profile...I'll post it here too!

"event","No one has been posting very often. That's kind of crappy. That's the best way for me to keep in touch with you guys, but if you're all too busy then I completely understand. 

So, I have an exam this coming week in my Economic Decision Analysis class.  That shouldn't be too bad as long as I study for it. I have three homework assignments due Friday. Two of them are from Music Theory and the other is from Material Processes. 

That last class I mentioned is semi-entertaining. My professor is Asian; so, it's sometimes difficult to understand what he's saying. We've been using the equation for ideal gas. PV=nRT
Anyways, Professor Hu pronounces ""V"" as ""Wee"". So, when he is referring to ""PV"" he says ""PeeWee"".
Before I realized his odd pronunciation I could have sworn he was randomly placing the word seaweed in his lecture, but he was just talking about constant volume heat capacity, ""Cv"". Then there is one other odd sounding word he says. When talking about the work done on or by the system we're studying, he refers to this work as the worker done on or by the system. He has a pretty good understanding of the English language right down to punctuation, but he does get confused by some of our classes questions, for example, the second day of class, this girl was (or what seemed to be) trying to earn brownie points with Dr. Hu and she asked where the symbol for thermal energy (q) came from. She was asking if it came from Latin or Greek or something, but he misunderstood and explained what heat was for 10 minutes or so."

So, my day has been pretty crappy so far. For some reason I had a ruptured thinking aneurysm and I thought my racquetball class was an hour later than it actually was. Even after I noticed that certain events were occurring at different times than I thought normal. For example...my new roommate Kathleen left before I did, when I left first Tuesday. Granted I didn't know her schedule, but it didn't feel right. So, after being questioned about it by 3 people this morning...I still maintained the thought that it didn't start until 9:30. Well, when I got there 5 minutes early and only one guy was sitting outside the racquetball courts...I started to wonder and quickly realized the mistake. 

Then my badminton class is in one of our &quot;multipurpose room&quot; where you're supposed to swipe your ID to or they aren't supposed to let you in...well, I forgot my ID. So, I ended up going in the back way...it didn't say anything about using the other entrance or anything...but I feel like violated some ancient pact that no student should ever go that way or something.

The most annoying part of it was that I knew I was forgetting something. I knew something wasn't right. Interestingly enough though...I'm in a fairly good mood. Considering my crappy start.

My mom called and she said I should be getting my laptop today, so that's good. 

Danny has an 8 hour lab session every Thursday, so that should be interesting.

Well, I'll get going now. Later days."

So, it's really warm here. I forgot my laptop when I come up here. So I'm in the computer lab.   Classes today were classes. Classes tomorrow will most likely be classes. And I think I'm going to die from the heat. I hope it rains when I get back to the apartment. And my phone battery died. So it's there recharging. I don't have a USB cable for it yet, so that's sad. For some reason I keep typing the "".com"" part of web addresses as "".xom"". I think it's pretty awesome anyways. My parents insisted that I bought pepper spray, so I did. I should just spray it at random people and then run away. It would be mean. OHOHOH!!! I could spray it on some food and then have someone eat it. That would be bad too. OK well, death from the heat is going to happen soon, so I'm outta here. 

O, and my head feels like it's on fire and it's not because my hair is died red again. But it is died red o\so it looks and feels like it's on fire. OK."

And I've spent about 2 months at my grandparent's house doing work and reading awesome books, and eating awesome food, and gaining an awesome amount of fat. So, iI didn't end up getting a job. It's been one thing after another. First there was Matt and Beth's wedding. Then there was a death in the family. Then Dad totalled his car. Then he had to have surgery because his intestines had shifted somehow and a foot had to be removed from it. Then we went up to the Mackinac Bridge so Kristen could get her Sr. pics taken. then it was my BDay. Along the way I forgot my password to Facebook. Then We went up north for the 4th of july week. Dad was off work for about a month because of his surery. Danny had very bad experiences with his truck. I drove my grandparents back down for about 10 days in the middle of July, then I drove them back up. I did all sorts of house work to help them out. Then I came home with Danny this weekend to prepare for school. So, I never did find a job for the summer. I thus far have read over 20 books this summer. Life has been good.

"event","To the morons on campus who have decided to leave threatening notes in our buildings, YOU GUYS ARE STUPID AND I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST COMMIT SUICIDE.  So, students have found a second threatening note on campus. The first was in our ROTC building (number 4), the second was in our Electrical energy resource center (number 7). I'll give you a more in depth explanation of the map upon request. Anyways, now I'm on edge whenever I see someone running,not a jogger or anything, but just some random student running to get somewhere quick. I immediately think that they know there's a bomb in the building and that they're trying to save their own neck. The first note came on the anniversary of Virginia Tech. This leads me to believe people are just being ass hole-ish and trying to either instill fear or get out of class. 

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/str1p3dp4nt5/pic/0001t650/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/str1p3dp4nt5/pic/0001t650/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""169"" border=""0"" /></a>

Of course, the school only tells us they they found notes, they don't tell us what they say...not a bad idea in my opinion, but even telling us that a threatening note was found was too much info. My guess is that the second note was someone copying the person who left the first one. I would have been fine if they just told us that a threat to such and such building was discovered...and not say anything about the note, that way unimaginative people can't copycat.

Certain people are making me mad. I'll probably post an entry sometime explaining more about this, but not now.

So, my sister is going to have two surgeries this summer, one to take out her wisdom teeth and the other on her knees, cuz they're constantly bothering her and doctors have done all that they can including putting her knees on steroids. I'm sure that there's a joke in there somewhere, but I'm too tired and in a hurry to think one up. So...(insert steroid usage joke here). Look one up on-line if you have to. Anyways, Danny got an internship, lucky jerk. So he'll be up here pretty much all summer while I'll probably be downstate most of the summer. He's working for a mining company in Ishpeming(maybe?) and he's trying to find an apartment in Marquette. I found out from my grandma that my grandpa's last remaining brother is having all kinds of health issues...for instance, he's going to need an oxygen tank from now on, this kidneys are failing too (my grandpa's on dialysis), and his heart's giving out (he had a heart attack a couple months ago I believe).  I'm depending on two of my finals to pass a couple classes which is never good. I'm really on edge because of finals and people it seems are TRYING to get me angry, expect another post pretty soon to get more in depth on this). For example, people in my classes trying to convey infinite knowledge when all they're doing is simplifying what the professor is talking about, or people with no regard for others so they 1) talk during the whole class 2)don't clean up after themselves 3)talk extremely loud when there's no call to do so 4)have an annoying laugh 5)try to critique me when I'm in a bad mood 6)hinder the flow of traffic

So, those are some of my problems right now.

This is a great song!!!

"event","Thinking Of You  (a poem made by me)

i see you in the halls,
it makes me want to cry, thinking
about the times we had together
now they seem so distant in the past
i feel like we are growing farther and
farther apart, even though you are right
next to me, and i look at you and smile,
knowing that we will always be friends, 
no matter how many fights we encounter,
i see the new girlfriend, and she 
seems to be perfect. perfect for you,
i am happy for you, but deep inside 
i feel so much pain and resentment, 
why did it have to be this way?
was it destiny that made us not
be together? i feel her glance at me,
and i dare not look, for fear i will
glare at her in hatred, for she is
beautiful, and i am but one pathetic
human in deep love for you, my one
true friend, but you cannot see it,
for i never show that side around you.
inside i bleed. i sit and cry. knowing that
you do not know how i feel."

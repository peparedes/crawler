i don't. all i do know is that cat stevens is the perfect companion to a lazy demeanor. i woke up this morning to realize that i have less than three weeks of episcopal high school left. so ends an epoch. what's important is that i leave with good memories, good friends, and something to show for six years and 72,000 dollars. its a shame to put a price on education, but for some reason doing so forces me to remember the magnitude of what has consumed my being for such a very long time.

maybe i should learn acoustic guitar? (tangent inspired by the music i'm listening to)

so anyway, i'm going to go and get my hawthorne on."

"event","hurricane season has passed. finally. 

perhaps i shall prepare a little more for the next batch. i've had enough late night studying to last me for the next several years of high school. 

i was productive today. windows were cleaned, pots were washed, and beds were made. a productive day indeed.

the experience might be getting its renovation this break. but like my neighbor's house, a renovation may take a year.... or longer."

Friday night was rockin'. the kiss/aerosmith concert was incredible. i partook in much fun during this event. i'm now very fond of all things aerosmith-- i've even purchased an album. 

last night's choral christmas concert was kickin'. 

semester exams soon. all is well that ends well."

"event","i realize my lj entries have been somewhat sparse in this latter month and i present my humblest apologies. 

curses. what to say, what to say. 

my recent discoveries 
- a 5 day weekend doesn't cure apathy
- never write a paper about a book you like; you may hate it afterwards
- withdrawal is tough. from both a musical comedy and sinus medicine
- the *bux holiday beverage selection makes me happy
- calls made by ACC officials must include an area code
- i do the best imitation of myself
- school depresses me
- marta pauly is wonder woman

there's the point by point. 

i hesitate to finish this entry. perhaps i will. now."

i'm finding it difficult to express myself at the moment, but i'll try.

<i>she's singing how far, how fast, and how long</i> 

as all hallow's eve nears, i muse over actually participating in the festivities. most likely i will, but only half-heartedly. 

i need to work on <i>life of pi</i>, the book club may meet soon.

<i>there's got to me something more than what i'm living for. i'm crying out to you. </i>

"event","so here it goes... 

my life may be rather dull at the moment, but just you see... just you see.. something's coming

today, a freshman asked me to go with her to homecoming. all i said was ""i don't go to dances. i don't believe in them"" i hope i didn't cause any heartbreak. 

2 weeks until the production of pippin. this may be the enthusement i'm looking for. 
the crazy cast party awaits.

my classes? oh, they're just fine. all i desire is stability in this oh so fickle world. 

i do not believe i'm capable of a 4 sentence paragraph. 

i'm going to second ryan's ""magical theatre"" comment. the theatre is rather awesome. 

i've so much to do and so little time to do it. wait. strike that. reverse it. its a three and a half day weekend."

"event","all in all, i am glad i attended epworth. though certain entities... stephen...  were not seen, i still kept a 75% ""i'm liking it"" rating the entire time. kudos for spyder and david for keeping me entertained... the falsetto was well worth it.  despite the rash generalizations the speaker made concerning guys and girls... i found edification in most of what he had to say.

can't wait to direct THE BEST SCENE EVER tommorow in theatre.

i'm preparing for the PSAT, yes that's what i'm going to do. 

next weekend i've a test to complete. god, please be with me while i do it. (not the psat)

crazy germans! its oktoberfest at ehs tommroow

"event","I haven't had a drink in... about three-ish weeks. I'm special. You know what? Joel and the others need to get their asses in here, because I don't like being the only GC dude around here. And you know what else? I need to find that <b>Tasha</b> girl and get her to make me some more ""Bakies"". And I just saw that she has me in her info thing. That's pretty damn hot. 

What else.. I love Heather. She's the best little kid ever. I like spoiling her, getting her little barbie dolls and stuff. It's pretty cute to see how her face lights up when you pull a new toy out from behind your back. 

As for Jenn... What can I say about Jenn? She's been helping me through my problems. I don't know what I'd do without her. She's beautiful, and she's mine. So ha. *sto to everyone* 

Speaking of everyone.. I've talked to about two people around here. I think I need to meet more people. Hit me up at <i>benji1madden</i>. And if you see my brother around anywhere, grab his ear and drag him to me."

"event","I hung out a little bit with Tasha last night. We went to the grocery store to get some ""no-bake"" cookies. I ended up accidentally letting all of those bouncy balls out of the big cage they were in.. They were rolling all over the store. Oops. Then we went back to her house and made the ""bakies"" after sprinting from the store to avoid confrontation with a couple girls who spotted me. 

I also took Jenn out for dinner, and we ended up going back to my house.. She found a bunch of alcohol around and started dumping it, then she had to go to the bathroom or something and I sort of chugged a bottle of vodka down. I tried to stay away from it. I'd almost forgotten that the liquor cabinet was full until she asked about it. 

I couldn't help it though and the damn stuff was just sitting right there. *sighs* I guess I'm gunna be going back to those shitty AA meetings. Wohoo.

"event","Hey. I'm Benji Madden. I play guitar for the band Good Charlotte. I'm sure you've heard of us, if you haven't, it's about time. I have a twin brother, his name is Joel, and he's also in the band. We're from a little town called Waldorf, Maryland. We grew up with a simple life, and we write music about the way things are. I have a couple piercings and lots of tattoos.. If you wanna see them, ask, and I may show. 

That's about all I have to say for now, since I hate introductions. If you wanna know more, hit me up at <b>benji1madden</b>.

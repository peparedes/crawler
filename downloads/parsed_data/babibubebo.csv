I often ask myself, why do I do the things I do...but I never seem to get the right answer. Everything just piles up and there's never a full solution to any of the problems at all. Same thing is happening over and over again...I guess it's my problem? Maybe I was never meant to be in a relationship? Think it's time I know myself better...and figure out what I'm doing wrong....</p>"

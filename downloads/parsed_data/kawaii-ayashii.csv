"event","I don't know why, but I've gotten a new appreciation for this song. Mostly the chorus, but the verses also mean something to me. It's just one of those songs that makes me feel better when I listen to it. The chorus is somehow uplifting for me, thinking of life as a dance floor. We are the music, and life is a musical to me =P And since this is not a five paragraph essay explaining why I love this song suddenly, I'll leave you to ponder my lamest journal entry EVER!!! MWAHAHAHA!!!



[VERSE 1:]
I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes
Now I see the world as a candy store
With a cigarette smile, saying things you can't ignore
Like Mommy I love you
Daddy I hate you
Brother I need you
Lover, hey ""f*** you""
I can see everything here with my third eye
Like the blue in the sky

[CHORUS:]
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

[Verse 2:]
I've been the girl- middle finger in the air
Unaffected by rumors, the truth: I don't care
So open your mouth and stick out your tongue
You might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done
So find a new lifestyle
A new reason to smile
Look for Nirvana
Under the strobe lights
Sequins and sex dreams
You whisper to me
There's no reason to cry

[CHORUS:]
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it

[BRIDGE:]
You take what you get and you get what you give
I say don't run from yourself, man, that's no way to live
I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin

If God Is a DJ... If God
If God is a DJ (life is a dance floor)
Get your ass on the dance floor

[CHORUS (2X):]
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
Love is the rhythm
You are the music
If God is a DJ
Life is a dance floor
You get what you're given
It's all how you use it


Gotta love it! *rocks out*"

"event","Whoa, another year come and gone. Does anyone besides me find this a lil scary??? It's like my life is flashing before my eyes! 
    
I think something that's made me realize how much time has gone by, was the fact that I can now drive! With a passenger of 4 or more years of experience in driving, of course. =P A couple of days ago, I drove from the University back to my house. That's a fair distance for a new driver like me! And 60km/h is faster than you think when you're in the driver's seat! People are going so fast around you, and it's really freaky! They also seem like they want to kill you because you're actually going the speed limit!! When I was driving at the speed limit which was 50km/h, everyone started passing me! My mom just told me to ignore all the people passing me. >_< Yes, ignore the big flashing vehicles going past me! EEK!Especially when they're these huge gas-guzzling trucks! Oh well, I'll get used to it, eventually.
    
Also, the first semester of school is almost over. It's my first senior year, which is kinda wierd, because just last year I was in grade 10. Now it's my second last year of high school before I have to try and get into college! And for someone like me, that's definitly nerve-wracking... I almost feel like time is slipping through my fingers, and soon there won't be any left. o_O
    
I'm trying to get into the habit of siezing the day, trying to do as much as I can, and enjoy myself. I just don't feel like I'm being productive with anything. I don't get high marks like my friends, I don't have enough confidence to do a lot of things, and I don't speak my mind. I've been doing it a bit lately, but not about the things that are important. Strange, I give advice to people, but I just can't take my own. *sighs* Still workin' on it! Maybe that should be a new years resolution thing? lol Get that confidence level up! It shall be difficult, but it's something I'm willing to do!! I really need it if I'm going to get anywhere! 
    
Well, I hope everyone had an awsome new years party or wtvr they did! I'll try to update more. So far I have... wut, 2, 3 entries?? lol! Pathetic! 

Until next time!"

"event","It seems to be one of those days that I don't know who I am. I don't know what I should be feeling. I just get really down sometimes, and when people ask what's wrong I just reply ""I'm tired"". Why would I say anything? I don't want to bother them with my problems, and sometimes I don't understand why I feel down. Yeah, I waste some of my time sulking and being depressed. Big waste when I could be happy right? I really wish I could be happy all the time. I really do! Sometimes it's just really difficult to keep smiling. I feel like I can't measure up to someone, so I sulk wondering why I can't be better. At time I don't really feel like I have outstanding talents, or anything to be proud of. 

I'm very supportive of my friends, but why can't I support myself? I give myself answers, but I don't act on them. I give my friends advice, when really I should be the one taking it. But sometimes I'll just stand there in the circle of friends feeling like I'm not really in it. I'm outside, watching, just wishing I was in there and smiling. Why can't I be happy all the time like other people? Sometimes I feel like a selfish bitch for wanting attention, but sometimes positive attention is what I need. I need to feel like I'm equal to everyone else. But when I feel sad, I think people choose to ignore me because it's like I ""want"" attention. Like I'm a selfish little brat in the candy aisle of the corner store, just begging her mother for some sweets while she looks away. If she ignores her, she'll just stop doing what she's doing. The basics.

Am I selfish? Do I want to much? Am I that much like a little kid? Sometimes I feel like I want so much, but the next day I think, ""I'm not asking for too much...""  I guess it depends on the situation. 

Well, I guess that's enough venting for tonight. *sweatdrop* I know this wasn't very interesting, but I don't think too many people look at this. lol Until next time."

"event","Well here is it ladies and gents. It's the last day of summer holidays, and of course all the stores are closed so no more back to school shopping. =P Or clothes shopping, but that's pretty useless for me since I go to a school with uniforms. But it's fun anyways! Today I'm stuck doing house chores though, since my mom is off of work today, she always gets us to do SOMETHING, and it's always cleaning up or work. Meh, it's something to do. Not to mention I have to get my binders and things ready for tomorrow. I really can't wait to see my friends! I miss them all so much! 

I'm still trying to get over the fact that I'm half done high school, and now in my second last year. I'm a senior!WhOa!! I hope that doesn't mean people will be looking up to me! lol Now I really have to be putting effort into my work for school... lol Colleges and Universities will be looking at my marks from grades 11 and 12. PRESSURE!! *hyperventalates* 

Well, I hope everyone has a good school year! All the best!"

"event","Yeah, I'm crazy. I'm actually looking forward to going back to school. =P I'd been feeling pretty useless all summer because i had had very short shifts near the beginning, so there really was nothing to keep me busy. But now that it's back to school, our store's a lot busier! (Staples) So I've been getting very good hours. My last pay check was very nice and I was like ""OH YEAH!!!"" :D  

Today when I was just going into work, I was putting on my shoes, and I saw something was on them... I thought it was a piece of brown wood... IT WAS A MOTH!!! I'm so afraid of moths, and I kicked my shoe halfway accross the room, and was shaking for an hour.... Wow, I'm really pathetic. Well, everyone has fears though. Some people are afraid of spiders, I'm afraid of moths!!! It was horrible... So yeah, that was the highlight of my day right there... Nothing really life changing happened, except for when my mum came in and bought these AWESOME new speakers, and I'm just rockin out to music as I'm typing!! Trying out every type of music =P 

Well, that was my update. Until next time!! lol =P"

"event","<P>Wow! My first entry!! This is special, isn't it?? Well, it's supposed to me. I don't normally sit in front of the computer and post up about my life or anything. My Doctor told me it would be healthy!! lol jk guys =P So, should I introduce myself? Since I did a pretty crappy job in the entrance page where it's like ""about me"" to which I put, ""I'll update later."" Or something along those lines.</P>
<P>I've always hated having to come up with ""about me""'s on these webpages where they say ""Just put something about you!"". I'm always going, uhh.... I LIKE PIE!!! &gt;_&lt; I never know what to say about myself because I've always felt that in order to get to know me, instead of reading a summary about my life story, someone shud actually take the time to talk to me, and know me and not a summary. I'm always worried about what people will think about that little blurb that I put in that limited text box. But really, that little box is a first impression that people have when they browse for people. They judge by it, and decide on whether they want to talk to you or not. And being the self-concious person that I am, I don't like that. </P>
<P>Oh yeah, didn't I say I was going to introduce myself?? X_X Well, my real name is Dayna. (No last names! lol) For those of you wondering why the heck I used ""Kawaii Ayashii"", it's Japanese. Yeah, just like the Otaku (anime geek) I am, I just had to use something Japanese. Kawaii:cute Ayashii: suspicious, or skeptical. Kind of a wierd combination of words isn't it?? It rhymed tho!! &gt;_&lt; I just recently turned 16, and I can't wait to go back to school. I've been so bored and I miss my friends very much.</P>
<P>I have a feeling though that the first week of school is going to be slightly stressful for me if the teachers decide to give me homework. I just recently had a couple of work shifts dumped on me from my manager. I was scared because if I said know, I'd have to make up some sad story, which I was sadly lacking. But really, this is more money, and I'm making more use of myself!! Instead of just sitting my ass in front of a computer all day. *coughs* Sometimes it gets hard to be working while going to school. Juggling homework and work can be a bitch. Since when I get&nbsp; home from school, I have about an hour to get stuff done before I'm picked up, and am at the store until a time at night I'm too tired to do anything. Wow, I really am a whiner aren't I? But what better way to get it out than to just write it on the net? I never thought this would help or nething. =P</P>
<P>Well, I think this shud be good enough for a first entry, no?? Until next time! ;-)</P>

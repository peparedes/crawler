Was just looking at my last entry's comments and, yes Kym, I forgot to talk about our bathroom painting adventure! For those who did not join us on this adventure, I happen to have a bathroom inside my room. It has a shower in it, but I used it to store transformers rather than wash myself. Here is a picture of it before painting (shower emptied out):

It's tough to take a picture of such a small room. As you can see it looks like crap. So we took a day off from slacking off and painted it! I actually was supposed to paint it LAST summer but I'm glad I waited because I got help that way. Thanks Kym!

Other unfinished business from last entry: My mom is back from Florida. So far she has not tried to shoot mind bullets at me, so I think we're ok. She's moving her dance teaching business out of this rented place and into a much better, cheaper place (on top of the future shop downtown), and she's trying to get a website for it. I tried to help but it's very confusing.

Also me and Lawrence DID go to Q-town for that show, it was pretty great. Radical Attack SUCKED, whatever that other band that shared half their members with Radical Attack was SUCKED, If Hope Dies was alright, Walls of Jericho was alright (some douchebag pushed the singer off the stage and she just left and they stopped their set), All That Remains WASN'T THERE AGAIN (I've paid 3 times to see these guys and they only showed up once), A Life Once Lost was alright except the people there didn't seem to enjoy them and they actually got really mad at us, The Red Chord was missing a member but still destroyed everything in sight (they'd just come back from a tour with the Hulud so that's like, +20 respect points right there), and Unearth finished up with a killer set! Ken threw a speaker at us!!! O: Then I got a guitar pick from him:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN6063.jpg"">

In conclusion a lot of the people at that show were retarded and didn't know how to dance and had no taste in music and I deeply hate them all. Otherwise had a great time.

We were also supposed to go to NYC for Ozzfest but we didn't because I was totally broke. I am still partially broke, but I worked a bit so I got SOME money. First I sold drugs for the Gillett Entertainment Group:

JAY KAY I ACTUALLY PUSHED BOXES. It was the Elvis Story take out. Helllooo 45 dollars an hour! Then I did take in/out for the vans warped tour, that was fun. I went to bed after the take in but I came back a bit early to try to catch some bands, saw Everytime I Die and Alexisonfire, totally missed HORSE the Band and Protest the Hero (more on PTH later). Then we took down the half-pipe and the guy there (who was clearly high!!! FUCKING KIDS) was like ""thanks guys each of you please take a case of this"" so I took home a case of this ""...lost"" energy drink, it's ok. Tastes like free (and orange). Fucking hippy didn't want to get the case back on the truck! And then later that week I did Mariah Carey, that was also cool. I saw Sean Paul and his official rum bottle carrying guy.

It's kind of tough to remember what I've done all summer. I haven't updated since the beginning of June!

Oh yeah, at the beginning of July was the CUMC!!! I don't know if I've mentioned this in here before, but it's a math conference, this year it was hosted by my university. Next year it's going to be SFU (in Vancouver) and I am going also! yaaaaaay! Anyway it was cool I learned a bunch of things and of course I suck at talking to people and I didn't actually make any friends until the closing banquet which, for some reason, was on an island somewhere. Turns out these people had been refering to me as ""emo kid"" all week. Motherfuckers. Then I showed them I was cool and then it was totally cool. Cool.

I've been reading (math and non-math) books during the summer (...the library has AC, my house doesn't) and that combined with the conference has me actually pretty excited to go back to school in a couple of days (sept. 5). It's weird, honestly, I don't think I've ever felt that way. I have a nice schedule next semester too, I'm happy with it.

Ok I'm pretty much out of ""big things I did this summer"". Today I went to HMV and bought PTH's Kezia and Misery Signals' new record, Mirrors. Haven't listened to Mirrors yet, but jesus christ Protest the Hero is great! I'd downloaded a couple of their songs a little while back after seeing the video for their first single off of Kezia (Blindfolds Aside), and all the other songs I got kind of sucked. Turns out they were all old songs, and they actually refuse to play them live because they suck so bad. So I downloaded more songs off the last record and was quite satisfied! Truth is I am totally gay for concept albums, and I have been looking for something to listen to ever since I got tired of listening to Co&Ca's blahblahblah Burning Star IV volume fuck off claudio. I'm glad this CD never goes into crazy 20 minute keyboard solos (not that Co&Ca does, but I've listened to way too much DT and Ayreon), and has good, non-cheesy lyrics. Well ok, there's the bit in Bury the Hatchet that goes ""I SWEAR I HAVE COMPASSION, I'VE JUST BEEN TRAINED TO DISREGARD THE PRISONER'S LIFE, 'CAUSE I'M THE PRISOOOOOOON GUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAARD"" which sounds exactly like something Arjen Lucassen would write (<a href=""http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/ayreon/intotheelectriccastle.html#3"">I'd wield my blade with crimson gusto for I'm the proud barbarian host!</a>). Also no wonder Wikipedia lists Between the Buried and Me as one of PTH's influences, the intro for Turn Soonest to the Sea sounds EXACTLY like the intro to Alaska!

Tomorrow Kym's comin' over and we are eating motherfucking chicken tacos. FUCK YEAH. Then I think friday we are going to that science center thing and it sounds pretty cool. I'm pretty big on science! Hopefully they don't make mistakes or oversimplifications because I'm also pretty big on being a jerk about it. I suck.

"event","Let me just start by telling everyone to shut up, I don't give a fuck if I haven't updated in 3 whole months >: (

School is over. About time. Don't yet have all my grades, but so far they're like B+/B-. Hoping for an A on the one I don't have yet. Overall it's half-decent I guess, but I'm pretty certain I'm getting out of Honours. I don't really like it and I'm not even sure I fit the requirements anymore. I have to go ask someone I guess.

For now I'm just gonna sit around for a few more days I guess, then I suppose I should look for some kind of job.

If anybody's wondering what I've been doing during the past 3 months, I don't even remember what I did last week. I went to some meets, played some video games, probably saw a movie or two, I think I was sick at some point, hung out with friends on various occasions and drank various amounts of various things, with varying success.

I am currently in the process of going through all the tony hawk games (except the first one, I don't have that one)  again for some reason. I'm not sure why.

The other day I went to Kym's house and we ate some kind of taco thing, except it was baked and flat, and I don't know why they even call it taco bake because it doesn't really have anything to do with tacos, but it was pretty damn good. And yes I know I talked about tacos in my last entry, but that was like 3 fucking months ago. I eat things other than tacos, I swear. Anyway, we also played video games, finished SH2. The ""leave"" ending sucks. Then eventually we were woken up by the horrible sound of jackhammering (and not the good kind). At least it was really nice out and such.

Eventually I left and, on the bus, some loser nerd had written the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts"">integration by parts</a> formula (the indefinite version) on the back of the seat in front of me. I laughed, people stared.

Yesterday I decided I would try to clean up this damn house. It's a start, I guess. Yeah, you'd think having like 20 cats in the house would help with the cleaning, but you'd be so horribly wrong. Those furry little poopmachines wouldn't even bother picking up a broom to save their lives. Fucking deadbeat potheads.

One of them had kids like a month ago. My parents call her ""little mom"" because, well, she keeps fucking getting babies. So now there's two new tiny grey furballs running around. I think you have to wait something like 2 months before we can get rid of them. We are getting rid of all the cats except my grumpy old Harold (who almost never leaves his corner now because the mom keeps trying to murder him in his sleep for no god damn reason), and the three remaining kids from the mom's last batch: Scarlett, David (his actual name is Charles, what the fuck kind of stupid ass name is that?) and Internet (real name is Babette, which is lame as well). The Internet just had babies too, but we're pretty sure they didn't survive. Scarlett's looking kinda fat too. The ones we are keeping are all getting fixed of course (Harold has been for a long time). This should have been done years ago. Also on the list of things that need to be done: half the phones haven't worked for the past like 6 months, my window has been fucked for over a year, and the window upstairs has been broken for 6 years.

In other news:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/griddlers.jpg"">

Yeah, I have no life.

I wanted to skate today but it's raining so I guess it ain't happenin. Maybe I'll do more cleaning, I dunno.

Also I got a haircut. Finally.

Tomorrow I'm hanging out with Kym! I don't know what exactly we'll be doing, but then again I never really do. Hell, I don't even know what I'm doing right now.

...and it breaks my heeeeart, like dancin up all niiight

ride so hiiigh, we both start thinking bout another woooorld, toniiiight

and it feels so wrooooong

LIKE NOTHING WE'VE EVER, FELT BEFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE

"event","I haven't updated in almost a month and I had so many things to write about but I forgot now.

Here I had something to say about ketchup chips but I can't find my dad's camera so forget it.

School is going okay I guess. Had a midterm friday, didn't go so well, whatever. Trying to keep up with assignments and everything, working okay. Have 2 more midterms before the study break, then another one after. Very exciting.

The other day my anal teacher thought my name was Patrick. I was offended. Those two newbies that were at the last goonmeet don't remember who I am either. But that's alright, I remember you guys, and I don't like you. So, you know, fuck off.

Friday night this week I hung out with Kym! I bought a book. That's right, I can read. It was recommended in that one thread about the spy emails and I thought it looked interesting and it was written by that guy who wrote a book about Fermat's Last Theorem that monsieur Darmon suggested and I want to buy too (along with a book about Galois theory I think but I forget now). I haven't really started reading it, will try tonight.

Anyone else pissed off that Fermat's Little Theorem and Last Theorem have the same acronym? Same goes for uniformly continuous, uniformly Cauchy and uniformly convergent. Why do all the uniforms have to start with a c? Fuck this shit. Also I just name-dropped 4 french mathematicians, take that you losers.

Ok back to friday night, then we went for bubble tea which was pretty sweet but I had trouble sucking those balls because my straw was too small. THEN we went to Pho Thahn Long or however that is spelled and after that we went to PUB. PUB actually has a name but it also has a giant sign that just says PUB so we call it PUB. It was really empty but they had a disco ball and nobody was dancing and it was sad. It was cool, I had fun.

Last night Lawrence came over because our camera appears to be working so we decided to try to work on some things. It was pretty cool. Then after he left I went for a walk! It was like 1AM. I saw Allopatrick on the street, he was walking alone too. I was like wtf. He probably doesn't remember who I am either, but at least he doesn't think my name is Patrick because that is his own name and you'd think you'd remember people who have the same name as you. When I walked back home, I walked by PUB at like 2:20ish, and there were like 5 people dancing on the dance floor under the disco ball. Various minds were blown.

A little while back I went to a show with Kym, it was pretty good. Adair, FFTL and SOTY all pretty much suck, but they sounded better live and it was enjoyable. ETID was awesome of course but it was too short. They played Pretty Dirty! I was so happy. They still didn't play Tusk and Temper, that song is so good. Also, The Logic of Crocodiles is the last pre-Hot Damn! song they still played. And now they didn't play it this time. The new single is The New Black. You guys don't understand what this means! It's only going to get worse from here on out :( DAMN YOU KEITH! They did play a lot of good songs though. If I remember correctly: Apocalypse Now and Then, Keith the Music, Bored Stiff, Easy Tiger, Pretty Dirty, maybe Champing at the Bit (not sure) from GP, and then Off Broadway, I Been Gone a Long Time, Floater, Godspeed Us to Sea and Ebolarama from HD! Anyway, it was great. Seeing them again at the beginning of march with the awesome lineup of Haste the Day, Bleeding Through and Between the Buried and Me. As of now I am still going alone but oh well. A lot of the really good shows I've been to I went by myself.

A couple of weeks ago, I forget why, my friends and I decided to go out and eat tacos. Then Blakkie was too poor because she bought new glasses, so we decided to make tacos instead. Then somehow it came to be that that night would be Tacofest 2006. So we bought stuff to make tacos, mexican beer, downloaded mexican music, and I busted out the sombrero. I don't know why I'm so obsessed with Mexico, honestly. 

<lj-cut text=""Here are pictures and shit"">

First these are the aforementioned new glasses she bought. What the christ.

This is my :ese: impression. It is not very good and I look vaguely retarded.

When I was cooking the meat I guess I messed up because it exploded on Ben's shirt

And so then I lended him my limp bizkit t-shirt. He still has it, mofucker >: (

I love this picture because it is pretty much the worst picture of all time.

Blakkie brought this picture of us at prom. Here are some people holding it up

Here is a close-up:

You may have noticed a black guy in the corner who none of us really know. He's just chilling in our picture and looking really confused as to what the hell he's doing there. Well Johnny, I'd like to know what the hell you're doing there too.

I guess I don't really have anything else to talk about. Can't wait until spring break! I swear winter is like already over, it's not coming back this time. I want to skateboard again soon, winter blows. Damnit now it's 6, I'm hungry.

"event","Today is my birthday. Half of my presents are in the mail somewhere I think, but that's alright, I'm used to it, that's what always happens. Me and my waiting until the last minute to tell people things I want.

Saturday night I went to Kym's house for like dinner and stuff, it was pretty cool. I haven't really eaten turkey in a long time but that was really good. Then I got some sweet-ass gifts! I am currently still wearing this math-related t-shirt that says ""<i>i</i> am not real"" on it (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit"">explanation</a>). I got it from her along with some awesome SA emoticon stickers (not pictured) and the :ese: and :rolleyes: pins:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5822.jpg"">

I am quite pleased. From my parents I got the black 30Gb video iPod I requested, with absolutely necessary Shai Hulud lyric engraved on the back:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5821.jpg"">

It's from <i>This Song: For True and Passionate Lovers of Music</i>, obviously. Yeah, there wasn't enough space for the, well, spaces. I also got the new HORSE the Band CD, which I haven't really had time to listen to yet. It does have a song about Birdo and mad keyboard breakdowns so, I mean, what could go wrong?

Last night we did kind of the reverse of saturday, it was fun. My dad bit into one of those tiny tomatoes and it exploded all over Kym's face. She had tomato in her hair and everything, it was pretty fucking funny.

Today I am making a cake for my birthday with my mom. It's in the oven right now. My mom doesn't cook either, I hope we didn't fuck it up.

Jesus, I haven't written in so long that I don't know what to write about at all. Exams sucked. I totally fucked up anal and I ended up with a C+. But it's over now...until january 3rd. What the fuck. I have never started so early, this is retarded. I have to meet with an advisor pretty soon, too, because I'm not quite sure what I should do at this point since I really didn't do very well anally. Oh well.

I bought some pants the other day. Girls' jeans. That's right. Ben wasn't manly enough to try some on, what a loser. I tried to take pictures the other day but it didn't work so good:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5812.jpg"">

They look great I swear.

Ok, I guess I have some kind of show-mentioning quota for every post, so here we go: Every Time I Die on january 25th AND march 6th with From First to Last/Story of the Year (which aren't very good) and Bleeding Through/Haste The Day/Between the MOTHERFUCKING Buried and Me (which are fucking brutal and amazing), respectively. Also maybe Taste of Chaos (april 15th) which is apparently completely different this year, as As I Lay Dying will be present, among other weird choices, like Deftones, Dredg (LOOK I AM SINGING THROUGH A TRUMPET) and Pelican. Oh, and Atreyu, but that's not as weird. Last year it was like...My Chemical Romance or something. They're not very chaotic, honestly.

In conclusion, here are some pictures of my cats I guess:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5789.jpg"">

The other day, there was an almost full glass of water on my nightstand and a cat knocked it over and so my bed was flooded. I wanted to put my sheets in the dryer but...someone was having a nap.

Ok so we got there and it was pretty empty and I was like wtf what's going on! Then mewithoutyou played they were alright they were just chillin you know. The singer/hobo doing the vocals had a cool story about how he used to date this girl who lived here and I don't think he ever finished the story. I liked when they started taking apart the drumkit while the over-expressive drummer was still drummin'. All in all pretty sweet.

Then Dredg. I don't remember what the music was like, all I can think of is the guy's stupid voice he sounded like he was in a god damn greek power metal band. I had to listen to a lot of greek music this summer and god damnit he sounded exactly like that and no sir I don't like it. Then he sang through a trumpet. Yeah that's right, he didn't play it, he sang through it. Then they did the same taking-away-pieces-of-the-drumkit-while-still-playing thing and I was like who the fuck do you think you are?!

Oh I got lost in the bathroom. It was really confusing. Like I saw this guy peeing at the other end of the room and I walked forward towards what I thought was the exit and there were only more urinals there and THE SAME GUY WAS PEEING THERE. What the christ. I made it eventually (I think).

THE BLOOD BROTHERS! There are not enough dual-screaming bands these days, seriously. I mean it's all like ""oh this guy does clean vocals, and this guy screams"", and I mean that's okay I guess but come on! It was so good, those dudes have some really nice screams. I don't remember exactly what songs they played, there was Feed Me To The Forest, Love Rhymes With Hideous Car Wreck (I did the little handclap at the beginning I felt so cool), Peacock Skeleton With Crooked Feathers (sooooo good), Rats and Rats and Rats for Candy, Crimes, Live At The Apocalypse Cabaret...that's all I remember. No Celebrator and no Devastator either >: (

Then Coheed killed of course. They had like background stuff! There were like drawings of the Writer, Erica and Ten Speed...and a giant fucking guillotine (not a drawing)! It opened its wings at some time throughout the set, it was sweet. Setlist:

Keeping The Blade
Always And Never
Welcome Home
Ten Speed (Of God's Blood And Burial)
Delirium Trigger
Blood Red Summer
Apollo I: The Writing Writer
The Ring In Return
Once Upon Your Dead Body
A Favor House Atlantic
Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow)
Wake Up
The Suffering
Devil In Jersey City
Everything Evil

Encore:
In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3
The Willing Well IV: The Final Cut

It was really fucking awesome. Finally got to find out what the hell the 12-string neck on that doubleneck guitar is for. Claudio uses this guitar it in the Welcome Home video for no apparent reason (because he doesn't play the second neck in it), but now we saw him use it for Always And Never, right before Welcome Home. Anyway, pretty much all fucking awesome songs, except for Wake Up which I just can't stand. Claudio said on the DVD that they were going to play The Light and the Glass! What is this bullshit! There is no way anyone likes Wake Up more than L&G. NO WAY. I'm also a little sad that there was nothing from The Velourium Camper (especially part 1 or 2), and no Willing Well I or II. I guess playing WWIII after Apollo I would have been retarded since they are essentially the same song (at a different pace, with a different ending), but I would have prefered WWIII instead. There was also no Cuts Marked In The March of Men, and no The Crowing (wtf, they've been playing this one like every show for along time). Also, they played a super extended version of WWIV which was pretty good at first but it got a little old and I was pretty tired by then. Travis always looks pissed but when he did his solo and he had that tube thing in his mouth he looked happy, I thought it was pretty funny. He was all WAAAAAAAAHwahwaawhahwhWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-banjo.gif""> Also, Claudio's singing is much much better now. Or at least his breathing is, I don't remember him being out of breath at all, unlike what I'd seen in all their live videos. And then at the end...the guillotine blade dropped! It was pretty sweet I guess.

I'm really fucking hungry. oh god what will i do"

"event","I haven't updated in like...3 weeks. I've been busy I guess. Lots of crap to do for school. I actually managed to do my work BEFORE supper today and then when I was done eating I was all confused and I didn't know what to do. I cleaned my room! Then I thought I'd update I guess. So this is it.

I just realized I bought a shitload of crap this past week or so. I bought some sweet tix:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5775.jpg"">

The AILD/Unearth/Slipknot show was sold out. Then I realized it wasn't really worth it anyway, because I really don't want to see those clowns again (Slipknot, I mean). I also bought We <3 Katamari which is so fucking awesome (more awesome than the first) that I constantly cream my pants and wonder what it would be like to then roll up these pants AND MAKE A FUCKIGN STAR OUT OF THEM

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5777.jpg"">

Oh those japanese, sooo zany. You can roll underwater! On fire! Roll up a fat guy so he gets fatter and beats this other sumo wrestler! Roll up planets in space to fukken ROLL UP THE SUN!!! You can also roll coop 2-player which sounds absolutely insane. Both players need to roll in the same direction to actually do anything.

I had ordered Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness, along with the graphic novel, and a fucking badass keywork belt buckle, from www.merchnow.com,  and I got the package in the mail yesterday. Only there was no belt buckle. Just a note saying ""oh sorry no more belt buckles"". The thing is, they sold way more preorders of the comic book than they had in stock, so they ran out. So it took them forever to send me my stuff, as they didn't want to send part of it now and the rest later. But did they hold the belt buckle for me, which I paid for like a month ago, until they could ship my stuff? NO. Someone else bought it, and they ran out. What the shit is this? I mean they gave me back the money I paid for it, but I fucking paid for it! You're not making any more money from selling it to someone else, you fuckers! YOU ALREADY HAD MY MONEY! I am fairly certain it was a more or less limited edition thing and there will probably not be anymore, and I am pissed the fuck off. A lot of people got free shit because their orders took longer than expected, including an Equal Vision sampler CD (had songs by Fall of Troy, Bear vs Shark and Fear Before the March of Flames on it) and some stickers. I got nothing. I got less than I was supposed to get. I've bought for well over 100 bucks of t-shirts from fucking merchnow, and they've always been fine, but jesus christ this is fucking bullshit. It's like that fucking episode of Seinfeld, with the rental car:

""Agent: Can I help you? Name please?

Jerry: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm
kidding around, of course.

Agent: Okay, let's see here. I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

Jerry: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?

Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the
reservation.

Agent: I know why we have reservations.

Jerry: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to
take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and
that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody
can just take them. *flails arms wildly in the air, pretending to write down reservations*

Agent: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.""

FUCK YOU MERCHNOW

Ok yeah now about the CD itself, it is pretty good, I haven't really had a chance to listen to it much.

The only good thing about having gotten it form merchnow is that the canadian version doesn't have the awesome black sleeve thing. Alright, don't read the next paragraph if you have no idea what Coheed and Cambria is about or if you don't want to get really confused.

I think Claudio has really gone mad now. A story within a story? A story about the writer of the story, but who is not actually the real Claudio Sanchez, but a character in his story, who writes the story inside this story? I didn't really mind when I realized that the Claudio character in the story within the story (not the real Claudio) was quite obviously a Jesus figure, and then that the ""Writer"" of this story was quite obviously God, but when I realized that about half of the story inside the story is really about the real Claudio and not just a space opera with some bibilical themes, I thought it was a bit weird. I mean, if it's not actually a story about space wars and badass cyborgs and wizards and shit, it's really just a guy singing about how this girl broke his heart...and he wants to murder her. When he said he accidentally wrote himself into the story, I just thought he'd named a character after himself, but it's really obvious now. I mean, Claudio has to leave Newo Ikkin to go save the world as The Crowing (or something like that), and the real Claudio had to leave Nikki Owens to...well I don't know, become a rockstar I guess. And then the Writer has Miss Erica Court, who he apparently used as the model for his Newo character. So really we have two (at least) different representations of the same cheating, lying whore of an ex-girlfriend. Way to let go of the past, Sanchez. Well, that's my interpretation anyway. I'm thinking he got sick of the actual story and was like ""...okay how do I end this...oh I know, I'll write myself into the story AGAIN, writing the story that I wrote myself in, and then have a FUCKING DEMONIC TALKING BICYCLE talk me into killing off Ambellina so that The Crowing gets pissed and kills off all my characters."" I mean it's a pretty cool unexpected twist to have the story inside the story, and I actually really like the story, but I enjoyed it more when it was about space and the keywork and the IRO-bots and all that crap instead of some writing dude.

About the graphic novel, I thought it was really pretty, although kind of short and hard to follow. Also, it has a BUNCH of grammar/spelling errors for something with maybe 500 words total. Also, a lot of the characters look exactly the same. Here's some pictures:

I think this is the Writer, but sometimes it's confusing. Welcome Home is a fucking rocking song though.

That ""never before seen!"" thing is a sticker. I think that's funny. Like, are they eventually going to not put the sticker on there anymore after a while? Are they going to change it to ""you might have seen this before"" or ""dude buy my fucking movie, american dad is shit i just need some dough -seth mcfarlane""? Actually american dad is ok I guess. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? * folding napkins* british metrosexual soccer icon david beckham, i can't do fricking swans! Yeah booboo enjoyed that one.

Alright well I guess I'm going to go sleep now. I just realized this entry was pretty much ENTIRELY about shit I've bought. I don't really know what else to talk about, I'm always working on some assignments or something. The Analysis and Algebra ones are usually kind of hard but I really like doing it and I feel like I've learned something by the end, so it's ok. The rest isn't so bad, really. I'm really not liking having to do Cal 3 again (because they wouldn't credit my 201-EEE which is was pretty much the same thing), the teacher is so fucking slow. Like I have my 3 math classes in a row in the morning, and that one's the last, and the first two professors are pretty fast and are alternating between theorems and proofs constantly, and then I get this guy. He's like ""so we have...this...theorem...now, I'm not going to...prove...this theorem...I don't...have time...I'm going to have to...hurry up""...every class. My Analysis teacher apologized for like 10 minutes once when he didn't prove a theorem. It never happened again. It's really not on the same level I guess. Now I'm worried that I'll keep going ah-ha! cal 3 is easy! and then do really bad at the end. It's not easy, it was my hardest class last semester. I'll be ok I guess.

Oh, I found this note on the floor in that class the other day:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5773.jpg"">

I thought it was funny. Who the hell says ""commence""? ...Is it creepy that I kept someone else's note? 

I would have taken pictures of myself but I need a haircut MY HEAD IS HUGE. Here are the kittens, knitting:

"event","Yeah so last day of summer. It's probably about time it ends, I've been running out of shit to do for a while now. I'm kind of stressed out about the going to a new school and all that shit, though. I hope I can sleep decently. Also I missed like two different orientation events or whatever, and I was supposed to talk to an adviser to approve my course selection...but I didn't. I mean I got an email from some senior adviser guy, and he was like ""yeah dude an adviser will be appointed to you soon fyi"" and I was like ok and I still didn't get shit. I emailed him back today asking wtf. I think it'll be ok, I still have up to the 13th to change my courses, just in case. Ben hasn't gotten approval yet either, and he actually was appointed an adviser. I'm going to pretend I was out of town all summer and just got back and be like I wasn't around it's not my fault!

Okay my foot/leg keeps vibrating a little and each time I'm like omg cellphone! But it isn't. For a while I thought I was dying, but now I'm thinking perhaps it is a series of small earthquakes. It's been happening all day, I'm freaking out man!

Yeah I'm just fishing for ""omfg ur so hot fyi"" comments. 

What the hell is with naming songs french things when they're not actually in french? Like ETID's L'Astronaut, or Winter Solstice's L'Aeroport. At least I think that's it, I always get them confused. I have a bunch of songs like that I always think are something else, and on my mp3 player, when I'm like on random playlist mode or whatever, I can only see the title of the song unless I'm actually listening to it, then it displays more info. So sometimes I get some great surprises! As I Lay Dying and Throwdown both have a song called Forever, I never know which one it is. I also always confuse Fatal Tragedy (DT) and Horrible Tragedy (I dunno). Then there's A Blessing in Tragedy (DH) and Meaning in Tragedy (AILD again). Oh and To The End,  The Final End, Time Without End, An End to a Beginning, The Beginning of the End, The Beginning AND the End, and just The Beginning. Yeeeeeah.

Man yesterday I did like a million things, I hadn't done that much since back in like march. I even made a little to-do list, there was so much stuff to do. I finally called that guy for my fucking greek money, I got my glasses fixed, I bought Opeth's new album (haven't listened to it much, but it seems pretty good so far). Shit I even bought some toothpaste! And some hair gel. I shaved and washed my hair! I think there was more stuff on the list but I forget. I should probably go to bed now. In closing:

"event","Oh man I can't sleep again, so I thought I'd write an entry or something. This is getting a little ridiculous. Last night at like 10 I was feeling really sleepy so I decided I'd go to bed! Yeah, bad idea. I woke up at about 2am and did not get back to sleep until like 7ish. 

Oh wait, I forgot the part where, when I had just gone to bed the first time, BEN'S MOM CALLED ME. I was in my room and I didn't turn the light on or anything so I couldn't see caller ID, so when they asked for Ben I didn't know if it was for him or just some random wrong number. I said he wasn't there. Then I went to check in the other room and it was coming from his house, so I called his cellphone, just in case he had actually disappeared. He sounded like he was in a hurry, so he didn't say much. Today I learned that it was some kind of cover-up story because he was on a date, with that one girl-I've-always-thought-was-his-girlfriend-but-wasn't-but-actually-IS. Crazy super strict parents or some shit. I told him he could give my number to her parents, that way I could hang out with them too. Also, now that he's (back?) with this girl, apparently he's not sure his previous girlfriend knows that he broke up with her (the previous one, I mean). I'm expecting the drama llama to come visit Mr. Fisherman shortly, and I'll probably laugh about it.

I was feeling pretty down for the past little while, and I even wrote this gay entry about it, but then I started reading my really old entries. All that old whining was ridiculously lame, and then I saw this entry where I mention to kick my ass if I ever write that kind of stuff again. So I kicked my ass, and I deleted the entry. I actually feel pretty damn good now, it's weird. I think the best part of that entry I deleted was where I said I was sick of something I was doing, but by saying that I was doing pretty much exactly what I said I didn't like doing, and obviously I can't say now what it is because that would be doing it, and oh god i'm stuck in some kind of unexplainable loop which only i understand

Oh another thing I saw among my old entries is that apparently I did not like Every Time I Die when I first saw them. What the fuck. I listen to them like every day now. Someone described them as music to listen to while you are out drinking until your face falls off, and I find it pretty accurate. The new album is pretty good I guess, except for the song that has the singer from My Chemical Romance in it, he feels pretty out of place. Keith's new vocals are okay, they just don't really sound as unique as they used to. People blame it on Melissa Cross (the vocal coach), who is responsible for how fucking badass Blythe (Lamb of God) and Labonte (All That Remains) sound now, and I guess they're kind of right. Keith used to have that voice cracking screaming thing going on, and it was really cool, but now he's got a lot more power behind his screams and they sound deeper and, well, he sounds just like pretty much everyone else. Anyway, I'm probably going to see them when they come by in october, with It Dies Today and Haste the Day. Some of the other dates have The Red Chord and A Life Once Lost instead, which I personally know/like more, but that's okay, at least I'm not seeing them open for MCR.

OMG NEW OPETH COMING OUT NEXT TUESDAY. I can't wait for 12 more songs about ghosts and fog! No seriously, I love Opeth to pieces.

The camera's fucked. I thought it was the tape but we tried another and nope, it's not recording anything anymore, and there seems to be something wrong with the playback. Thank fucking christ (actually, thank chris, that was my fucking idea) for the extended warranty plan!

Oh yeah, Booboob wanted to do some kind of party or something before we went back to school, so tonight we went to get some bubble tea. Yeah I guess we're not really party people. I had honey dew. Oh man I love those bubbles. Blakkie didn't come because she was feeling down/poor or something. She just lost her job. Again. I think she's had about 5 different telemarketing jobs now. YOU'RE NOT GOOD WITH PHONES, AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT EITHER, WHY DON'T YOU TRY FLIPPING BURGERS OR SOMETHING. Thanks.

The other day I saw this collection of little books and there was like one for each day and like the one with your birthday had like personalized information about the kind of person you are or some shit. I looked through it, and after the usual astrology/chinese astrology/lucky number shit, there was a page about my LUCKY FRUIT. Guess what it is!

WATERMELON

...Yeah.

I went to buy some school supplies with my mom the other day, and they had these new awesome-colored notebooks and I just have to take a picture, but that'll have to wait until later (it's like 6am now). Yeah I'm excited about the color of my notebooks, you can go fuck yourself.

HEY THERE
GIRLS
I'M A CUNT!

"event","I went for a long walk last night at about 2am I think and I planned out this whole entry and then I was too tired to write it when I got back so now I've forgotten what I wanted to say exactly.

My foot really hurts today. It hurt a bit when I decided to go walk yesterday, but it's a lot worse now. I don't know why I went, really. I do it a lot. My mom used to think I was going to see someone, a girl she thought. I'm not. I'm just walking. It's kind of lonely, I wish I could do it with someone once. This one time, this guy, who was obviously really wasted, started talking to me out of nowhere when I was out for a walk. We stood on that street corner for like half an hour and we talked about music and complained about how women are crazy. His girlfriend had just left him for no apparent reason, apparently. So I whipped out all my women are crazy jokes, and he was all like ""tru dat man"". It was cool. Then we parted ways and I walked by myself. I still really wish I could share my walking thing with someone.

The reason my foot hurts so much today is that I played DDR yesterday. Pretty badly, I might add. I haven't played in a long time, because of my injury. I can't really skateboard much either. That actually makes me feel pretty sad. I played yesterday because I went to buy my ticket (for UO/AOF) with Pat and her friends and we ended up in an arcade and I didn't feel so bad so I thought I'd try to play a little. It wasn't so good.

When I was buying my ticket, I saw a flyer for a Dredg/mewithoutyou concert. Now, I don't really know either band, but I do know that they are both touring with Coheed and Cambria and the Blood Brothers during the fall. I like both of these bands, and was pretty sad to see there was no Montreal date announced, but someone said only about half of the dates had been announced so far, so there was hope. Then I saw the flyer, but there was no mention of CO&CA or the Blood Brothers on it. I checked all 4 websites, and there is nothing anywhere about a Montreal gig. What the christ.

I have a little less than a week of summer left, and I don't really have anything to do with it. I woke up at around 5 today. I think the camera fucked up. Or the tape, might be the tape. Or the camera fucked the tape. Anyway, something's wrong. We filmed some new little bit and it took the whole night and then I guess something fucked up because there was NOTHING on the tape. Actually, the stuff was there, then I started rewinding to get to the beginning of it, and after a little while, bam, blank tape. Even the stuff that was there when I started rewinding was gone.

I think I had a brilliant segue to lead me into this next topic, but I forgot it during the night.

I am sick of all my passive-agressive bullshit. Oh and other people's too. I'm angry and I should just say it but I don't know how. So I'll just act like a fag every once in a while, and write about it in my journal. And then I just act all miserable because I am tired of it. I'll bring it up. Seriously, I will.

I've been thinking that I really need a hug, but then I got one yesterday, and it didn't do shit. I hope I can make new friends at McG."

"event","sup fags, just came back from outside, I was bored. I was going to watch CSI but then I'd seen it already. It's like 18 degrees outside, that's awesome. So I spent another day doing nothing. I guess that's okay.  I got some books to read the other day, I'm enjoying those. Also I spent most of last night trying to not have my head explode and to not puke up my supper. I don't know what happened. Then I fell asleep at about 7-8 ish am for the third day in a row. And it's not like I'm up all night playing video games or some shit, I'm up all night trying to not be up all night. It's really great. I'll get over it.

I went to the movies last night, saw the Aristocrats. There were some really shitty reviews on the site I go to to check showtimes and shit, like 4/10 stuff, and then I checked SA and it got like 9/10. So I took my chances and went anyway, and that was pretty fucking funny. It's kind of a documentary, about a really not that funny joke, which apparently is very offensive (more than half the room left before the end of the movie, and a lot of them looked offended rather than bored), and whose punchline is ""the aristocrats!"". You have like 80 comedians telling their own version of the joke and talking about it, and I was really surprised to hear a lot of them say stuff like that. Jason Alexander (George from Seinfeld) talking about licking scrotums and shit? what the christ! Also Gilbert Gottfried (paraphrased): "" a lot of people wonder where the blood comes in, well, of course, when you're FISTFUCKING your DAUGHTER, i mean, you know, ther emight be some blood"". The absolute most digusting version of it was, of all people, BOB SAGET's version. I never thought I would see the day where Bob Saget is talking about sliding around in your family's feces while doing grandma and fisting the dog. In the middle of telling the joke he was like ""oh god what the FUCK am i doing"". Another fucking hilarious one was this MIME who was just...well..miming the joke. There was no music or anything, just complete silence and a man miming having sex with his family/pets. Booboo told me he wanted to go see this with his girlfriend or whatever, and I was like uuuuh are you sure she won't be offended and he was like what, is there a lot of racist stuff against asians? No, no I guess not, there wasn't enough room left after all the feces, incest and beastiality jokes.

I think I'll go to bed soon. I don't know what I'll do tomorrow, probably nothing. Well, ETID is coming out with a new CD tomorrow, maybe I'll go get that. I know that doesn't take up the whole day, but when you wake up at 5, it's really almost over. Also, I need to call that fucker that hasn't given me my money for the greeks yet. My dad gave me his number but...yeah. I think my dad still has that paper I wrote my hours on, I kind of need it, too. Anyway, I was told of some shows coming up so we'll be going to purchase some tickets wednesday. WOW I'M ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING!! I'm not going to Gigantour, I don't really feel like it anymore, plus no one else wants to go. Also Hellfest was cancelled, makes me kind of happy we never really made any real plans to go.

In conclusion, if you review the material from the two other Calculus classes before this course, do part of the exercises as you go along, another part two days before an exam, and make sure you understand what you are doing, your success in the Advanced Calculus class is guaranteed. Of course, it is a lot easier to say than do, but if you put effort into it, it will work, and you will not have to take it again. You can even apply the method to pretty much every other Mathematics course, including the first step or not, depending on how heavily the course relies on others you have takHAHA I FOOLED YOU THIS IS ACTUALLY THE CONCLUSION TO SOMETHING ELSE

"event","Strangely enough, I haven't updated much this summer, even though I'm really not doing much. Most of the plans I had are not going to happen. Oh well, at least I got some rest. I still have a couple of days, maybe somehow everything will get super awesome.

Monday I went with Booboob to McG to get our ID cards. We read the information wrong in the thing so we ended up at the wrong place and we were all confused and it took us like all day. Oh well, at least now I know a little what the school is like and where the buildings where I have classes are. When I showed boobs my card, he was like ""haha you look like that one friend of yours!"" and I was like ""lequel?"" and he was like ""NO, LAQUELLE! HAHAHAHA!"" and yeah I can't really translate that so whatever. Here it is

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5668.jpg"">

Notice it says ""ETUDIANT(E)"". Shut up, my mom says I look like a movie star. Anyway, after that we were bored and mannie works close to McG so we went there to annoy her and then she was all like ""yeah my dad is going to die"" and we were all like uh...we really didn't know what the fuck to say when she asked us if we will go to his funeral. I've never even met him, and he's not even dead! So then we abused her employee discount and left. She works in one of them girls' accessories stores, that sell like bracelets and hair things and all that stuff. They also do like ear piercing with guns, and I don't know about you, but paying mannie to put a hole in your body sounds like about the worst idea I've ever heard.

The rest of the week I kind of sat around. Yesterday, Lawrence came over and we went to try to buy a new camera (again). We succeeded! We waited for like half an hour to try to find a salesman, but he was really cool. We thought we had done our research pretty well, but it turns out the same company was doing a cheaper model with better video quality, it just had a shittier photo quality, but I already have a digital photo camera, I don't need another one. The new camera's really cool, we wanted to test it out and shit so we did a kind of fake trailer for our second movie. There's still some editing to do, but it's really cool, I like it. Also, Lawrence keeps being all ""OH WATCH OUT YOU MIGHT BREAK THE CAMERA YOU HAVE TO BE GENTLE >: ("" and I'm like...dude...we bought the extended warranty plan shit (at rebate, mind you. Salesman guy lowered the price when we said we didn't really want it). I mean I could throw it at the wall, it could explode, and we could get a new one for free next week. He's always REALLY protective of ""his"" stuff (I'm still waiting on some checks, he paid for it for now), it annoys me to no end.

Today we went to some restaurant for blakkie's birthday (whhich was like a month ago) with her, Lawrence and boobs. It was pretty good. Then like when we were done, this girl that used to go to my high school popped out of nowhere and I guess she was just done eating too and she talked to us for a while, but she had to leave with her friends or something. The 5 of us were all in the same class, and I'm pretty sure Lawrence had a huge crush on this girl. She was talking to him like all the time but I'm pretty sure she already had a boyfriend and was just being a tease. I don't know if he still likes her or what, but after that he was acting kind of gay. After that we were supposed to come back here for a little while and then go get some bubble tea in chinatown, but while we were walking to go there he was just like ""ok guys I'm going to go home instead, I'm working early tomorrow"". We were just like...what. Then he left. It was HIS idea to go to Magic Idea, too. Then blakkie said she wasn't going to get anything over there anyway, so me and ben were just like...uh...and so we didn't go. Then I proposed we go buy some condoms for Ben.

You see, Ben has this lady friend, and as part of some initiation thing for university, she has to collect a list of items. She asked Booboo to get some of these. Last week we went to Chez Paree, supposedly one of the best stripclubs in town, to get some matches, because that was one of these items. After we got them I was like...well while we're here, why don't we stay for a bit? And they were all like no way. And then they call ME gay. Faggots. Another item on the list was a large condom. The smallest amount we could find was 3, so now we're hoping his mom finds the box, with only 2 remaining. The cashier had this really weird smile on when she rang up his magnum condoms, it was either she was laughing at him because there was no way he was large, or she was turned on and wanted to get it on with booboobs. Either way it was disgusting.

Then both Ben and Blakkie decided it was time to go, so they left. On the way to the metro, this group of like 15-year-old punk kids starting yelling at me, saying ""eeeeeemo!"" or ""emo sucks!!"". Ok, that's it. That is fucking it. I am so fucking sick of faggots saying I am emo when they see me on the street. I mean I don't give a shit if someone were to read my journal and I'm like complaining or sad or whatever and THEN they called me emo, but this is just fucking wrong. I AM A SCENE KID, NOT AN EMO KID.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5665.jpg"">

What is it in this picture that makes people think ""emo""? Starting from the top, that haircut is pretty standard scene kid shit. Long front, hiding part of face, and short spiked up back. Then, I guess if I had snake bites it would be more evident, but I don't, sorry, I'm still not emo. I don't usually wear the bandana when I'm not at a show, but boobs was wearing his (on his head) so I kind of half-jokingly decided I'd wear mine. Worn this way/covering mouth and nose is standard hXc dancer/pit ninja fashion, although I guess it looks kind of funny (gay) out of a circle pit. I don't wear scene/fashioncore women's jeans, but I do wear jeans, and so does pretty much everyone else, there's nothing emo about that. I wear skateboarding shoes, with a pink lace. Emo kids don't wear pink, sorry. Same thing goes for the nails, I have the shocker fingers in black and the others in pink. 

And now, the final part: Shai Hulud? Emo? What the fucking fuck are you smoking? It says ""MISANTHROPY PURE"" across the front, and ""AN ISOLATED INTEGRITY"" on the back, this isn't fucking TBS with ""the truth is you could slit my throat, and with my one last gasping breath, I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt"", this is Shai fucking Hulud. This is A PROFOUND HATRED OF MAN , this is ""IF THESE HANDS WOULD ONLY KILL, THEY'D CLEANSE THE WORLD WITH ITS OWN BLOOD"". Pretty much the only emotions Geert sings about are hatred, and passion. ""This song for true and passionate lovers of music"" is one of my favorite songs of all time, and is my definite answer to all people who ask how I can enjoy ""that loud shit where the guy is all screaming and shit and you can't understand anything"".

So please, retards in the street, stop saying ""emo sucks!"", because I tend to agree. I'd be more happy if you made fun of my dancing, or if you told me Norma Jean were a bunch of faggots.

BTW, punk kids who called me emo, I'm sorry if I mislabelled you as punk, but that Dead Kennedys shirt kind of made me lean in that direction. What's even funnier is that DK was hardcore punk, and that I listen to mostly hardcore/metalcore, so we're pretty close in musical taste.

You're still faggots."

Also the beginning of one of the songs (The Darkest Nights) sounds exactly like a megaman song. I laughed at first but then it got good (not that megaman music is not good) and then I danced again. Oh yeah.

HEY SCHOOL IS ALMOST OVER!!! I'm done with exams I just need to write a paper for french and the conclusion to my pap for PE. I'll do it today and/or tomorrow, it's for tuesday. Then stick a fork in me, it's over. Yesterday I went over to my electro partner's house to do our lab report on the beatbox. Got there at 10:30...left at 1AM. No we did not party or slack off or any of that fucking shit. We took 20 minutes off to eat pizza. That's it. Fucking 14 hours. 20 pages. Well we have some pictures in there, but still, 20 fucking pages. The teacher said like ok 10-15pages should be ok, and this other team did 9, with the cover page. I thought we would do even less, BUT NO! BECAUSE WE FUICKING RULE MAN

here's a pitcher of our beatbox

Also yesterday I learned the real reason why my electro partner went to live in the USA for 2 years. I learned from some other fag (bio partner last semester, who looks exactly like Daryn Jones) that he was a mormon and went there for some kind of mormon thing. So I was like ok whatever. Then I was starting to wonder why most of his stories started with ""so i was witht his other guy k"". No, he didn't go to america to be gay, he went there to chill, be more mormon, and go door to door teaching people about mormonism! They always do the door to door shit in pairs. My dad taught me that there was always a blond guy and a brown-haired guy,  but this guy has red hair, so I don't know wtf.

I went to see Batman Begins the other day. It was badass. Well, it had ninjas. And batman. And BALE! And his teeth. That's about it.

I'm feeling kind of lazy today, I don't know what to do. I don't want to start my work already but then again I don't really have anything to do.

oh man guess what I just realized! In exactly two weeks, I will be ninja kicking my ass off to some awesome bands at the SOTU. I'm still pissed FBTMOF is not coming like they were supposed to, though. They're coming by later on their own headlining tour, which I thought was kind of odd because I've always seen them open first. So of course I have never heard of any of the bands that are opening for them. Oh did I mention that, for SOME REASON, Montreal is the ONLY town on the tour where Opeth is closing instead of Lamb of God? I mean, that's awesome, Opeth has always been more awesome than LoG, but I just thought that it was weird that we were the only place where they're doing that.

I'm going to go pick out colors with my mom to repaint my room some time next week. I really have no idea. Last time they let me pick, it was those horrid greens and blues I have in my room right now. So ugly. Then my mom is leaving for Florida or something for like the whole summer. My dad's staying, but he'll be working most of the time anyway. Something tells me I'm going to be eating a lot of frozen pizza and kraft dinner."

"event","So here I am sitting in bed, next to my fan at FULL POWER and in my underpants. It got really hot all of a sudden, I hope it goes away. Actually it's not that bad I just get whiny when it gets a little hot. 

Oh man when I woke up a little while ago, I signed on msn/aim and there was NO ONE ON. And I don't mean like ""oh there were a couple of people on but I never talk to them"" or something, I mean...no one. Well SmarterChild was on, so the internet was actually working, I guess. I felt so lonely. So I DECIDED TO WRITE!!!

I have a lot of work to do today, because I have a lot of exams and shiet next week. I'll start when I'm done with this I guess. It's ALMOST OVER! Two weeks and a half, at the most. So excited.

I haven't really written in a while so I don't know what to write about.

Friday night was the MSI show. It was pretty cool. The opening act, The Birthday Massacre, was pretty bad. I had downloaded a couple of songs and it was all really gay and then when they started their first song, it was rockin and the girl did a couple of growled vocals and stuff so I was like hey this isn't so bad and then the chorus came and the keyboard player started playing and I puked out pink vomit with sparkles in it because oh god that was so gay. Three people started kind of pushing each other and then got bored. Also one of the guitar players spent the whole show staring at his pedals/shoes. The show was supposed to start at 8 (doors open at 7) and they started early and were done by 8:09. Awesome. Then MINDLESSSSSSSS! Jimmy threw a pack of cards at us for some reason. I got the king of...something. One of the black ones. I'm so awesome. People were screaming a lot every like five seconds and at some point he lit up a cigarette and people were like WOOOOOOOOOOO and he was like wow, you people REALLY like smoking. Eventually, the band left the stage and Jimmy brought out a stringless acoustic guitar and pretended to tune it. People were still screaming like faggots, and he was like ""wait a minute, I know what the problem is, it's your ATTITUDE! TUNE YOUR ATTITUDE!!"" and pointed the mic at us, people went wooooooooooo!, and then he was like ""sorry, you still sound a little french, try again!"". And then guess what song he played?!

BRING THE PAIN!

...

ACAPELLA!

It was great, we all sang. A Method Man song about shooting niggas, sung by a white man of ambiguous sexual orientation, with no music. Rad. Every time he said nigga, this girl looked at blakkie, presumably to see if she was offended. Oh, Steve wasn't there, he's still injured/recovering, so the guy from Tub Ring was filling in (I forget his name). He wasn't as cool. Gnome never showed up, either. Faggot >: ( Anyway, then we went to Lawrence's house and ate some burgers and played some soccer. Then we went home.

We were supposed to go to the movies last night but we hadn't checked the movie times and it didn't work out and then it was very complicated trying to find something else to do. We went MINI-GOLFING! It was pretty cool. It was like...banana-themed...and there were traps and like water shooting out of things. And the holes were all different and had wacky things in them. The score card thing was a banana and you had to scratch off how many hits you did. So we scratched our bananas a lot. That place was like perfect to make all the worst immature jokes ever. Balls, sticks and bananas, and holes. Like ""dude, hold my banana/balls"" or ""oh man i just stuck my arm in the hole to get my balls and this alarm went off!"". One of the holes like tightened around your arm when you stuck it in. One of the things had like a little wall at the beginning so you couldn't see the whole course, and you had to get your ball under it, and then when you went on the other side, there were like 50 other balls, screwed to the ground. It was cool trying to find yours. But the best one was the last one I think. If you waited for a bit next to the thing you put your ball on at the beginning after you hit it, water shot out and hit you right in the crotch. No, I didn't pee myself, I'm just an idiot. Anyway, I WON. TAKE THAT, FAGGOTS.

After that we came back here and chilled and played soccer. That's about it. Ok I'm bored with writing this I'm going to go do something else."

"event","i just came back frm outsiede. i went to this place i've been going to for a while. actuallty i think it's been more than a year now. i go there when i'm sad or whatevr. it's a cool placxe, but i can't tell you where it is or else that woul ruin the secret. usuallty it is emptyu but there were pepoel there tonight. anyway so this afternoon i woke up and i needed a goal of some sort so i thought hey i'll go out and buy something. so i wenty outy and i bought this coheed and cambria live dvd. i watvched it this afternoon it was pretty great. claudio keeps running out of breath. l,aaaawl. tonight i got to eat saupper at like 9 with a fucki8ng cat giving birth in the fucking dining room, like a foot away from me. fucking christ, when will the fucking cat madness end? STOP FEEDING THE CATS YOU ASSHOLES. then i locke dmyself in my room. i was suppsoed tyo do some shit fro french because xuan and alex are coming over tomorrow at 1 to like rehearse our fucking oral; but  i haven't done shit. i was n't feeling up to it. then i had a few drinks. actually i had one but we have these new really big glasses so yeah. then i went for a walk to my special place. i'm not feeling too good today.,

yesterday someone was all liek oh no i am having problems with my internet boyfriend and i was like haha break up with him! lawls! and i talked about it with someone else and they were like yes you're right! and i was like we're too old for this shit and shit. and then later my victoria was like hello! and i was like omg i haven't talkeed to her in a while. and we got to talking. and yeah...she wants to get back together it would seem. i've been waiting for this for like over a year. we broke up june 6th, 2004. but for a while before thatr we were on ""break"". we talked about why she broke up[ with me, and i thoguht it seemed sincere and made sense and stuff,. i donm't know. i should have been so fucking happyt. well, i think. i kind of stopped waiting for that a while ago. i wasn't happy.

last week, josee was over at a party of some kind at her friend's hosue and i guess she had a few. she was on msn at her friend's house. she called me baby. we hung out during the afternoon, and she told me on msn that night that she had wanted to kiss me. so iwas like ok next time! i didn't think she would remember. thursday night this week, she called me. she said she was coming downtown to shop or something and she was wondering if we could like meet up for a few mintues or someting. she also said she was out of cigarettes, and thatit would be helpful if i bought some for her. so iwas like ok. so we met up and shit and then when i was about to go back home she was like looking at me weird and i was like what and she was l;ike i don't want to go shopping...can i go over to your house for a while? and i was like...yeah...i guess...and then she grabbed my arm and wouldn't let go and we waltked back to my hosue. we watched some tv. i made some joke about the illuminati and she had no idea what i was talking about. then it got to about 9 and like stores were closing and her parents thought she was shopping so she was like ""i have to go...""...then she kissed me. it was pretty sweet. i was thinking that kind of cleared up the whole ""are we gpoing out or not?"" thing. a littlew. then she went home. also kissing people when they've jusdt smoked tastes wquite gross. i had an exam friday morning. i didn't get to study a lot and i didn't do tjhat good.

satuday she was supposed to come over agian. i was all happy;. i was like hey, i'm [pretty lonely, and i would like some affection, and here is this one person that likes me. so that's pretty cool. then she had some other crap to do and her parent s were yelling at her so she was like i cam't come. that;s about when vicki started talking to me. i talked to her until like...2:30am.

i['km so confused. i was thinking about josee last week and...i doin't love her. i don't. i don;t have that ""i'd like to do something nice for you"" feeling. i like her though, she's alright. she's a warm body to put my arms around. i feel so lonely sometimes. i don';t like that ii have to explain most of my jokes though...and she doesn't get most of my refrecfences/quotes. i have to translate everything, because her english is very poor. but she's still nice and...she likes me. i have this thing about liking people who like me, just because they like me. i guess because i have so little self esteem that i get so surprised that somevone likers me that i HAVE to like them back.

tthen i've got my vicki. i've got my victoria i have all these memories with and all this time spent with and who...actiually knows what i'm talking about. and who makes me laugh. and i actually feel like i want to make her life better and stuff. but then again she dumped me. but i think it was justified, we both needed some time off. but then again, even if i did tak eher back, i wouldn't be getting any kind of affection for a while...and i really need a hug right now.

i don't knoqw what to do, i don' know what to choose, or how to do it. neither of them know what is going on, can i get away with telling just one? hoiw? how will i do this? i don't know. i don't feel very good right now. i hacve no idea what i just wrote i hope it made sense the end"

"event","Here I am, taking a break from the intense study of mathematics to bring you another great entry! Next week is going to be CRAZY. Actually it's already crazy. I have my second Electronics test monday. That shouldn't be too bad, I have to study that tomorrow. Thursday is Physics and the English midterm writing thing...I have to prepare for that...and then friday, Math. Which, much to my dismay when I learned about it THIS WEEK, is not only on what we've done recently, but on everything we've learned since the beginning of the semester. That means before the strike too. Oops. Which is why I started doing exercises and shit like more than a week in advance. I have NEVER done this before. EVER. So proud. Seriously.

I had an oral (some conversation thing, done in pairs) to prepare for German next week but the guy never showed up. I can't even count the number of times I've waited in front of that library for some jackass to show up and they never did. Last semester I had some math thing to do in pairs, I had a 3 hour break where I normally went home but this time I stayed to do this math thing. His break started an hour after mine, I waited half an hour after that, never showed up. Fucker had dropped the class, didn't even tell me. I don't care if I have to do the work alone, I'd just like to not have to wait 3 hours when I could have gone home.

Yesterday, Lawrence, Blakkie and I went shopping kinda. She needed a shirt of some kind for a wedding she was attending. We ended up at Old Navy and I threw a bunch of different ones at her using my finely tuned fashion sense and she tried them on. At the end she was trying to decide between an AWESOME red and this ugly white and purple stripey thing. Lawrence and I were both telling her to go with red and then she asked these three girls that worked there and 2 out of 3 picked the red one. Then she bought the purple one, because one of them changed her mind. Fuck you guys. Then we went home and played video games.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5360.jpg"">

We rented that one mortal kombat game. We mostly played that puzzle kombat thing, that shit was awesome.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5368.jpg"">

Lawrence accidentally fucking punched me in the nose. It didn't break/bleed however. Then I tried to hug the cat and he clawed my face. I am disfigured. And then the greatest part...we were walking to the store to get some chips, and I started talking about how I wanted to make a choregraphy for us to do at SOTU and anyway I was pretty hammered and Blakkie told me to show her a ninja kick and I did and it was really fucking sick but the landing wasn't exactly up to par. I fell on my right knee and my left leg was bent at some weirdass angle. My hip hurts. It's the same one I fell on a while ago (see entry with the picture of my crushed belt) and I couldn't walk for like a week. Yeah, I'm an idiot, shut up.

I took some pictures of my face earlier, trying to make a new display pic for msn or whatever, and I was just looking through them and...ok a little while ago when we were up really late working on the movie or whatever, Lawrence turned around to look at something and I did that face that girl in the closet in The Ring is doing and it scared the shit out of him when he turned back around. Then he started doing it too, and it is now tradition. Anyway I took a picture of my best impression of it and I forgot about it and so I just got really scared looking at a picture of my own face! Good job. Here it is:

Hey what's the deal with those pre-cut bagels? I mean, I know I can't cut my own bagels properly, but how come they're not cut all the way? ...Ok here's the truth I wanted to do a little funny bit about pre-cut bagels so I went upstairs to look at the ones we have and then I was just like mesmerized and I did this

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5391.jpg"">

Then I ate my jewjewbe bagel golem brought to life through the power of I'm so bored I think I just might eat my own eyelids. It was ok.

I can't wait for my tax return check to get here. 477 dollars! I was getting so poor too. I wonder why

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5390.jpg"">

Yes, my future is filled with much rocking. Blakkie's coming to the MSI show, and she bought this shirt the other day which is...exactly like mine. So we're going with matching shirts. Greeeaaat.

I'm going to bed."

Yes I have been waiting since like last summer (or more, I forget) for a rainy april day so I could post that lyric.

So, show last night. It was alright. I didn't really know any of the bands, I kinda went just because my people were going. It was cool anyway, just not as good as the show two weeks ago. Also here is a message to bands everywhere: SAY YOUR NAME. CLEARLY AND REPEATEDLY. A band would finish up and I'd turn around and ask someone who that was and nobody knew. 

Anyway, from what I managed to gather through extensive research, Fear Before the March of Flames went on first. I think they were good? I don't even remember, I was too busy trying to figure out who that was. 

Then it was These Arms Are Snakes, who have a pretty cool name (not as cool as FBTMOF, however). I thought they were rad. They were different though, they had two keyboards and played an 8-minute song. It was enjoyable. At some point some dude got on stage and the singer put a knee on his chest and pinned him down while he kept singing, and the security guy was trying to throw the guy back into the crowd but the singer wouldn't let go. I laughed. Then I got elbowed right in the sternum really hard and it hurt really bad when I coughed afterwards (yes I am still a little bit sick). I'm better now, I don't think it broke anything (except my heart <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-emo.gif"">)

Hopesfall was supposed to be there according to Underoath's website but they weren't on the flyers or anything, so...yeah, they weren't there.

By the time The Chariot came around I kind of stopped paying attention and just pushed, ran in a circular fashion and ninja kicked the time away. Then they thanked the lord jesus christ. I already knew they were a christian band because the internet informed me that Winter Solstice, As I Lay Dying, Norma Jean, Underoath and The Chariot were all christian bands. Oh well. At least the first 3 bands didn't mention anything about jesus when I saw them.

Then it was Underoath, they were pretty good. I had downloaded a couple of songs and they finished with Reinventing Your Exit and A Boy Brushed Red...Living in Black and White, which I thought were two pretty good songs. A guy jumped on my head from the second floor, I didn't see it coming at all.  

A LOT of people I recognized were there. Like half of the local band that opened first at the AILD/WS/TD/ATR show. I saw the whole band in front of the paramount last week too. I saw this guy that was in a couple of my classes, Eric. I wrote about him before, he's the one who has the same belts and similar clothes as me. Apparently he's going out with that really ugly girl that's in my french class. Her friend who used to stare at me all the time in Bio class was there too. They were all sitting on the second floor (looosers). I was sad, I didn't see that guy that works at Subway that's always putting a lot of effort into aligning your cheese perfectly. I saw him at the show two weeks ago, then during the week after I went to Subway and he recognized me and stuff. He's cool. Oh also I saw a girl who had the same shoes as me, but had the pink lace on the right foot and the black on the left (I did the opposite). Blew my mind.

The other day I got up to find someone had left a puddle of jizz by my doorstep.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5306.jpg"">

It kind of freaked me out. It was more liquid when I first saw it, and it got bigger since, too. And I stepped in it a couple of times. Then I realized it was the washing machine that's across from my room that had leaked soapy water under that grey stuff and it came back up in that crack and dried.

Friday night, Lawrence, Booboob, Blakkie and P-tard came over to watch our movie. I asked Vin to come but he already had plans or some other shit excuse. Bastard. Anyway, they liked it! Oh joy! My mom came home towards the end of the movie and stood there and watched part of it. Like the part where Lawrence walks in holding a giant inflatable hammer between his legs and goes ""HEY! LOOK AT MY DICK!"" and then I start hitting it and it deflates. In our defense, that was like 4 years ago, we've grown up (a bit) since. She was also there at the end where there's like footage from new year's eve and it's like:

Lawrence: So what are your new year's resolutions? Smoke less pot?
Blakkie: ...
Lawrence: ...doing something with your life?
Blakkie: yeah ok doing something with my life

Then the credits came up and I had to stop the movie because my mom was still there. I almost forgot, too, Lawrence had to tell me to stop it. After the credits is Vin's part, where he runs around outside in his underwear/pees on a mcdonald's/humps a plastic deer. Oh and we have that picture of his right testicle flashing by a couple of times. We made that part for blackmailing purposes, honest.

While me and Lawrence were waiting for all the other retards to get here, we were bored and sitting at the computer with the window next to it open and we heard a whistle and Lawrence whistled back and then I did some kind of high-pitched scream. Then I had the brilliant idea that we should stand next to the window and scream when people walked by. So I explained my idea, stood up, went to the window to check if anyone was coming, AND THERE WAS A GUY THERE, with a yellow sweater tied around his neck, and he had his hands on his hips and was looking all angry and up at the window. He must have been standing there for like 5 minutes. I loled and ran to get the camera but he was gone by the time I got back.

I woke up all congested and coughing and my head had magically transformed into a magical land of fairies where they hit each other with hammers made out of fucking PAIN until they collapse on the floor in violent seizures and then...uh...then I guess they die or something. I felt all creative and then I lost my train of thought. Speaking of trains of thoughts, I learned today that DT is releasing a new album in june. yaaaaaay! Also I bought the new MSI CD friday. It's definitely no FGWSSS. Damn you Jimmy, what the fuck happened to dicks being for your friends and toupees and hating jimmy page and generally being a huge faggot? There also seem to be no montreal dates for the next tour...that sucks. And Steve Righ? was injured somehow I think and won't be playing for part of said tour.

...Ok what was I talking about? Oh yeah, I lost my voice today. I guess it's not that bad (LOOOL BECAUSE I DON'T TALK A LOT GET IT) but it's still not very cool. Someone called my cellphone earlier but I didn't pick up because...well...you know. I hope it wasn't important. It wasn't a number I recognized.

"event","Updating because I'm sick and bored. Also we're on strike today. Like, we stopped the unlimited strike last week, but we have a one-day thing today. I was really tired of the strike but I'm glad for today because I needed to rest. I had like a huge fever yesterday or something. I really didn't feel good, then I slept like 15 hours. Also, both next mondays are strikes, but it's like the teachers or the janitors/lab technicians or something, not the students. That means we don't have to replace those days at the end of june!! Awesome. Also, one last thing before I stop bitching about strikes: they've decided to put the time we lost the tuesday afternoon when we voted the unlimited strike next tuesday, from 12 to 2. I don't know if that made sense, but anyway, that means I have FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUOUS PE, WITH NO LUNCH BREAK. Great plan you jerks! <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/mad.gif"">

The other day I got one of those little papers that tell you the mailman tried to get you a package but you weren't there (which isn't always true, half the fucking time they don't even ring the fucking bell and I'm like right fucking there and they're like eh and just put the paper in your box). The name written on it was ""J. Haug"". My mom's name starts with an M, mine with a C. I was like what the hell, but I was still really excited as to what it could be, if it was for me. I wasn't expecting anything, after all, so it was a surprise!!! I just left it there because I wanted to ask my mom if maybe it was for her or what, and the next day it was gone and there was a package from McGill for me. My mom went to pick it up I guess. Then YESTERDAY, there was another one of those papers!!! This time it said ""C. Haug"". I was about to pass out and die when I saw it (because I was sick) so I didn't go pick it up yesterday. I went today, SUPER EXCITED again...and...it was the same thing...again.

Fuck you guys.

Yesterday in my feverish state I was really thirsty and there were no clean glasses so I checked the dishwasher and it was just finishing up. It was like in the drying cycle or something, so the glass I took was hot. Then I poured cold water in it.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5305.jpg"">

Yeeeaaah...that was a good idea...I'm blaming it on the fever but honestly I probably wouldn't have thought that could happen even if I wasn't sick. The cracks go all the way around, I'm surprised it didn't explode in my hands.

Sunday was the Winter Solstice/All That Remains/Throwdown/As I Lay Dying show. Jesus christ El Salon is RIDICULOUSLY SMALL! The stage was like as big as my bed. There were like 100 people in there. Anyway, it was BRUTAL. That is the only word capable of defining it. I don't know what the first band was, some local guys. They were pretty cool. Man they had 3 guitar players, for a total of 6 people on stage. They had NO ROOM at ALL. Then it was WINTER SOLSTICE! Which are AWESOME. At the beginning:

Singer: *goes to say something in the mic, covers it up with his hand and turns to the guitar player or something* ...Where are we?
Guitar guy: montreal
Singer: WHAT'S UP MONTRREEEEAAAAAL WRRROOOOARRRG CALIBRAATE THE VIIIIIIRUUUUUUUS *BREAKDOWN*

It was cool. I was right at the front so I heard him talk when he had his hand over the mic. Then All That Remains came on, awesome also. I thought their lead guitarist was funny, he really didn't fit in at all with his long metal hair and his beard. They're coming back for Sounds! Kickin' rad. Then it was Throwdown...they weren't that good. I don't know. Too many sort of punk-ish drum beats and ""I DON'T TAKE DRUGS!!"" straightedge lyrics. We get it, you don't take drugs, thanks. I don't either, but I don't feel the need to scream it at everyone every opportunity I get. Christian rock bands constantly talking about jesus are equally annoying.

Then As I Lay Dying came on, started with 94 Hours, straight into Falling Upon Deaf Ears. Fucking awesome. Fucking. Awesome. Oh man the drummer is great. In one of the songs (a new one, I don't know what it's called, it was JAWESOME), the whole fucking stage was vibrating. They also played Distance is Darkness and Undefined, which are awesome. At some point the singer said they had 3 more songs, played one, and then announced that it was getting late, and that it would be their last song. I wonder what song they had to cut out...if it was Behind Me Lies Another Fallen Soldier, I am really sad I missed it. Anyway, they finished with Forever. I don't think I have to mention how awesome it was.

Ok I'm feeling pretty tired again, I'm going to find some food then I'm going back to bed."

We've been on strike for A MONTH NOW. I'm starting to get angry. We're voting again monday, hopefully for the last time. I actually want to go back. This is taking away from my normal summer of not doing anything, except I know I should be doing work instead of just being able to not do anything and not care. It's kinda stressful. Oh man I hate <a href=""http://www.cmaisonneuve.qc.ca/vie_etud/forum/"">my school's forums</a>. What a bunch of faggots. I got so angry the other day, someone was like ""oh let's cancel the semester"" and like EVERYONE on there was like ""ok good idea it was going to be too hard when we go back anyway"". WHAT THE FUCK! NO YOU ASSBUTTS. I do NOT want to do a summer semester and (most likely) go back there to finish some other courses in the fall. I WANT TO FINISH BEFORE THE SUMMER. If somebody actually proposes this for some reason and we vote on it, when they ask for the people against, I am going to raise my little piece of blue cardboard so quickly and with so much force that my arm will tear right off and catch on fire and be sent into orbit around the sun and then into ANOTHER FUCKING DIMENSION

YOU GOT THAT YOU FUCKING HIPPIES?

Ok enough talk about that shit. THE MOVIE'S DONE BITCHES!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5272.jpg"">

And it works! And it's okay but I still think it lacks something. Lawrence keeps writing everything and I can't write when people are around and I SWEAR I'm funnier than he is god damnit! We started the next movie kinda and I definitely have to write something good for this one. The first one was all like old crap and stuff, and we had a couple of like nostalgia segments or something, but we don't have that for the next one so it'll be PURE FUNNY. Well not the whole thing, we're doing a sequel to the OPETH PROJECT thing which I have no idea if I talked about. Man like that entire thing is me making some weird faces I can't stand watching it.

Anyway, we were going to finish that last friday and then go show it to vin at his party but some shit fucked up at my place and I couldn't bring the final thing to Lawrence's house to burn it so we had to redo the final edit at his place, export it (takes like 2 hours), then transcode/burn it (another like 3 hours). We would have been late, so we just said fuck it, forget about the movie, let's go get drunk at vin's house. And so we did. I don't have any pictures or anything like last time. Last time was a failure, it was just like the three of us in that one room, listening to our music, filming ourselves, and generally being fags. I mean seriously we could have done that shit at home pretty much. Seriously I think I have a problem with documenting my life. I almost ALWAYS bring either camera, for some reason. So this time I said fuck that, I will not bring it, I will try to talk to people. And I did! I had a good time.

I had the same exact conversation with this one dude as last time. It took me a while to realize it, but it was the same. He keeps trying to convince me to listen to some BM and he annoys me to no end. Fuck you and your grim frostbitten moonforests <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-black101.gif"">, and AILD rocks your face off bitch. Man I didn't see most of this following story because I was in the basement but this one other guy who used to go to my high school was on various drugs and apparently offered some other guy's girlfriend a hundred dollars to make out with him or something, she said no, and when he went to check his wallet, he thought someone stole the $700 he was carrying for some reason, even though the money was STILL IN HIS WALLET, and then shit went wrong and he  whipped out some kind of telescopic stick thing, hit blakkie in the leg (too high to feel anything (as always), but now has a big bruise!) and some other guy in the face. Of course like the good cop-in-training/muscle man he is, vin tackled him and got him in some crazy entire body lock on the floor and then I think they probably beat him up and threw him out. Then later he came back with a hockey stick so they beat him up again. I hope Vin doesn't invite him next time.

A pen exploded in the pocket of my best pair of pants and now they are ruined.

I cried. It's worse than it looks I swear. I went shopping with the people I met at the last show yesterday but I didn't buy anything. I guess I'll just go with my mom again, that's always worked out okay.

I bought some tickets

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5277.jpg"">

Nobody wants to come see AILD with me. So sad. Actually there's still one person I haven't asked, maybe I will during the week. It's on a sunday though, and they live pretty far away, so I'm probably going to have to go alone. Oh well. The dates haven't been posted officially on the sounds of the underground <a href=""http://www.soundsoftheundergroundtour.com"">website</a>, but they ARE on <a href=""http://www.opeth.com/frameset.html"">Opeth's website</a>. It's coming here July 3rd, at the Stade Uniprix. The ""one more devastating headliner"" that was yet to be announced is heavily rumored to be Lamb of God, as they were mentioned on <a href=""http://www.everytimeidie.com/_new/"">ETID's site</a>. If it is them, I wonder if they'll do the <a href=""http://ozzfest.com/timages/page/media/WallofDeath.mov"">wall of death</a>, that would be awesome. Lawrence is coming (for Opeth, obviously), so are the rest of my going-to-shows people. It'll be so awesome I think I will be in a constant state of pants-creaming.

THUMBS UP MOTEHRFUCKERS

I don't have a lot of outlets in my room and since I don't use it very often, I usually unplug the phone in there when I don't need it. The other day, at about 4AM, I plugged it in, I forget why. I wasn't going to call anyone or anything, but whatever I was charging (cellphone, mp3 player, whatever) was done and I didn't need the outlet anymore so I just plugged the phone back in. The little light was on. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5276.jpg"">

The one that tells you the line is in use. I was actually kind of scared. I picked up...no one was on the phone, it was just static. I figured maybe plugging my phone back in fucked up some things and so I unplugged it and went to bed. Today my dad noticed it and indeed our phone has been non-working for like 3 days and still doesn't work, we don't know why.

Other scary story: we bought this beach ball thing when we were doing the movie and just spent time kicking it around or whatever when we were sick of editting or while something was converting/building preview/exporting/whatever, and it's been lying around my house for a while. Right now it's sitting next to my door, not touching it. The other day, once again at like 4am, I open my door to go get something to eat upstairs...I see the ball there...and it's moving. Scared. the fuck. out of me. There was no one around, I went back to bed. Turns out every time you open the door it happens, I don't know why exactly, it's not touching the door. Every time I step out I see this

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5270.jpg"">

and I go AAAAAH WHAT THE FUCK and seriously I could just move it but this is just too great.

I am having a lot of trouble typing this shit because I fucked up my right index the other day. I was emptying the dishwasher (I don't know why, it's my job but I never do it because I'm a lazy bitch) and I was holding two coffee mugs with one hand and one of them like EXPLODED in two halves. I was like crap. Then my dad was like what and so I like turned towards him and explained I just broke some mug and he was like oh ok and then I turned back around to the sink where the mug and my hands were and I WAS BLEEDING EVERYWHERE HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK. It was ridiculous how much blood came out of that tiny cut. Here it is now:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5269.jpg"">

It didn't hurt or anything that's why it was really weird to see all that blood. I don't know. Anyway.

Mannie is doing some birthday party thing at some club tonight, I don't really want to go (because I don't like her (or clubs, for that matter)), but Lawrence does want to go and I guess I don't have anything to do, so I don't know. We'll see. Anyway, I think I'm going to go dance in the rain now.

We were planning to finish it by next friday and maybe show it to Vin then because he's having another party. I don't know if we'll manage to finish it by then. Oh well, I can't really do anything, what's left to do is all up to Lawrence really. He backed out of getting his hair cut again, and this time he actually had an appointment. I don't know what the hell.

I'm not as sick anymore but I'm coughing a lot and I'm really tired. I suck at sleeping. Thursday I stayed up all night, then at 11am friday I went to another assembly for the strike. All the seats on the metro were taken on the way back and I kept falling asleep standing up and falling down. Almost broke my face. People stared and made fun of me, it was cool. Then I slept until 9:30pm. We were supposed to do something that night, but it was too late to do anything when I got up. I suck. I'm starting to feel a little depressed, I need to start sleeping properly.

Like all of this afternoon they showed back to back Transformers Energon episodes on YTV. I hadn't seen the series yet, it was okay. A lot better than RID, which was the last I saw before that. Then they showed the fucking original TF movie. Now that cheered me up. So much better than the newer crap.

I've really run out of things to say. The internet knows everything about me now. I'm going to go clean my room.

P.S.: I was really excited about <a href=""http://www.soundsoftheundergroundtour.com"">this</a> the other day but now I'm just really tired. The dates/places aren't up yet but Unearth's lead vocalist said they would come here."

I was writing this in bed on the laptop and I'm obviously brutally retarded because everything I wrote disappeared.

Anyway, here is what I had, in note form:

-I am on strike
-voting was long and boring
-we're voting again next monday
-I have this week off anyway it's spring break

I am really tired. We've been working a hell of a lot on our stupid movie and it's coming along pretty nicely I guess. We stayed up all night working on it last night, for the third time (not in a row, we're not that crazy). Last night we went all the fucking way to, up, down and back from the Mont Royal on foot, in really really cold weather, to film maybe 30 seconds of crap. But it'll be good crap. I hope. Seriously I really hope people like our movie because if I'm the only one laughing it'll be sad.

Lawrence is supposed to cut his hair (which he hasn't done AT ALL in maybe 3 years) for a part in the movie (because he has to play two characters) but he keeps going oh noooo i don't know how to cut my hair someone call the waaaaahmbulance. He wrote the script! He could have written that the second character wears a god damn hat or something. He's such a card.

The other day I was walking down the street at about midnight, and there was this little store that closed down a while ago and it has these big windows in the front and it's all dark and empty inside, and when I walked in front of it, I wasn't paying attention and I heard someone hitting on the glass from the inside and I turned around and I saw this like 7 feet tall thing (pretty certain it was a man) inside the store wearing a lot of make-up and a long blonde wig and it was staring right at me, trying to make a sexy face. It scared the FUCK OUT OF ME! I mean, I'm flattered that ugly transvestites think I'm cool or something but HOW ABOUT NOT JUMPING THE FUCK OUT OF NOWHERE MAKING LOUD NOISES OKAY

Last monday, Scars of Tomorrow, Norma Jean, Unearth and Atreyu played here. I got there early because that's what I always do, but they actually let us wait inside so I didn't lose any toes (this time). There were only 4 of us for like HOURS, so I made friends! It was pretty cool. I mean, I probably wouldn't hang out with them otherwise, but it's cool to have people to go to shows with. Anyway, we were waiting there, and one of the techs asked us if we wanted to help out a bit, so we helped unload Atreyu's trailer! like omg! Then the woman who asked us to help was like ""sorry the band doesn't like this you can't help anymore"". I guess that's understandable, I wouldn't want people I don't know who may or may not be qualified handling my equipment either. ehehehe handling my equipment

Anyway, we got posters out of it, and we got to go in first. I got my poster signed by Atreyu's drummer/clean vocalist! I also got my picture taken with the bassist and one of the guitarists (not the midget one), but I don't know when/if I'll ever see that picture. Standing in line inside was like the coolest thing ever, all the band people kept walking by because there's only one entrance to that place. One of them would walk by and everyone would go silent and when they were gone people would be like ""hey wasn't that [band member]?!"". I hadn't heard of SoT before but we talked with their bassist, Bob, for like 20 minutes. And then when they played it was pretty awesome! Norma Jean was pretty great too, but I was there for Unearth and Atreyu, and they rocked more than ever. Also it's the second time in a row that I go see Unearth and they say ""we just learned today that we're coming back to montreal in a couple of weeks"". Fucking awesome. 

I'm going to go try to find some food. I want some ketchup chips. I think I'm going to try to get some work done tomorrow. I did vote for the strike pretty much only to have more time to catch up after all, and I haven't done anything yet. I have to read this book called ""Les nouveaux maitres du monde"" and it's about like evil corporations or whatever and it almost beats this other book that I also have to read this week in which they spent maybe 10 pages talking about PLANTS and another 15 about SHEPHERD'S PIE and I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be funny but it's really not. I bet this is how people feel when they read my journal.

maybe I'll just take/post some pictures tomorrow instead"

"event","Hello sunday afternoon. I am so glad last week is over. I had so many things to do it was crazy. I had these two lab reports to do for physics and me and laurent spent like 3 hours doing them monday, then another 2 hours tuesday, then I spent like 2 hours wednesday and thursday night. It took like 10 fucking hours! It's worth about 1% total. What the hell is wrong with me. I didn't even spend that much time doing exercises/studying for my math exam friday and that was worth 20%.  

Anyway...thursday I had english, and there are about 40 people in the class, and after the break (it's a 3-hour class), there were 14 of us left. Everyone else just left. I should have left too. After the break, the teacher showed us a powerpoint presentation ON THE COMMA! Many clever jokes about getting into a coma because the comma presentation was so boring were told. ell oh ell. Also, that classroom has two clotheslines on one side. I had a class there last semester and there was some kind of art hanging from them but now there's nothing on them, and I was sitting right next to one and I was like twisting it for like 10 minutes and eventually I let go accidentally and it started spinning really really fast and going VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR really fucking loud. Everyone stared it was great. I suck.

We are voting on the general unlimited strike next tuesday at lunch time. If it passes, it is effective immediately, and that means I get out of PE! HOORAY! Speaking of PE, I managed to somehow get 100% on that PAP thing. I think it was the teacher's assistant that corrected it though. That woman is fucking scary. She is like entirely made of muscle. She could probably break my good pal Vin Diesel in half. So anyway, unlimited strike...it would also mean I'd get the rest of the week off, and then next week is spring break. That would be pretty tits. If I remember correctly, my school has voted yes on each and every strike that has been proposed over the past like 40 years, save for one, so there's a pretty good chance.

Yesterday, Lawrence came over. We did some work on the movie...we're trying to organize a bunch of little segments into something that makes sense. We wrote little things on <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5168.jpg"">post-its</a> and put them on my wall. There would be a lot more but we ran out of post-its. Once we get it all there I guess we're going to try to order them in a way that makes sense. Right now we have little clips all over the place over like 4 computers and 4 tapes, so it's kind of hard to have an overview of the whole thing.

Then we called the two non-whites but Ben was ""busy"" so he didn't come. Me and Lawrence made ourselves some food and then my mom got home and we watched some TV in the kitchen while my mom made herself food. Then Blakkie got here and SURPRISE! she was stoned off her ass. She was like ""hey guys you know what word I realized was really cool to say? Apt!...apt...aaaapt...it's cool because you have to like...apt...you know?"". We were like uh... My mom was right there too, but she didn't say anything. I guess it was kind of funny at first but it got really fucking annoying. Especially when we were trying to explain like a funny story that happened or like how to film something or whatever, and she didn't get it, and we explained it again, and she laughed, and she still didn't get it. Who the fuck shows up to hang out with two rather moderate drinkers, who were most likely not going to be drinking anything, really high? Are we really that boring? She could have just stayed at home or whatever. We'll use the fucking tripod next time. Also she <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5169.jpg"">wrote</a> on one of our post-its, I just noticed it this morning. Bitch.

I saw Vin sign on today, his nickname said something like ""TO ANYONE INTERESTED PARTY TONIGHT"" and I was like what the hell party on a sunday? And then his nickname changed to ""AWESOME PARTY LAST NIGHT GUYS"". Thanks for calling me you jackass.

Okay, enough bitching. I'm going to go for a walk or something, I have nothing to do right now and there's no one to talk to on the interweb.

i've finally reached 50000 words oh god when will the madness stop"

I've had this journal for a year and a day and so I thought I'd post an entry about it. I wrote some crap then my browser crashed when I looked for a definition of tits on urbandictionary and so now I don't feel like writing for real. I composed a song, it is supposed to  be playing in the background but it didn't work and I don't know how to make it work so whatever. <a href=""http://www.tindeck.com/audio/file/44o4x-oneyear.mp3"">Here</a> it is I hope you like it. So, in short, I have changed during this year blablabla I stopped writing super long boring entries and moved to pictures and that's about it the end. Here is a picture from my first picture entry:

"event","I went to JF's house last night. I brought my camera because me and Lawrence wanted to film ourselves doing our dance thing in front of a bunch of bored people, but we ran out of tape and we just didn't do it after all. Here are SCREENSHOTS of RANDOM THINGS!

<lj-cut text=""click here for story and pictures"">

Lawrence was working until 10PM, so me and Blakkie met up at the metro and went to JF's house and he was going to get there later on. When we got there, there were two guys standing outside in front of his door and I was like what the hell. Then they asked me who I was and they had A GUEST LIST. I was like...uh...what. Blakkie's name (with a mention that said +1 next to it) was there, but not mine. I was the +1. We got in, and the kitchen is all you can see from the entrance, and there seemed to be a lot of people there so I was like holy shit there are a lot of people here! Then we walked in and there were maybe 6 people in the kitchen and no one anywhere else. However, according to JF's nickname on MSN, there were 57 people total there last night. 

Me and Blakkie just stood on the ""dance floor"" for a while and then she was like LET'S GO SOCIALIZE! and I was like wha. So we sat down next to these two girls. I have a huge problem with remembering people's names. The thing is, when a person first tells me their name, I get a little nervous and I need to concentrate to make sure I say my name correctly and I end up not really listening to them. I am so awkward. One of the girls asked me if I was going to dance later and I said probably not and then when she asked me why, my phone rang so I went away to answer it. It was Lawrence, saying he was coming. Oh, speaking of my phone, I finally have caller ID/voicemail so I can actually know who calls me/call them back. Someone called me FOUR TIMES monday and I don't know who the fuck. I'm really sorry, whoever it was. 

Anyway, then Lawrence got there and, because we suck at social interaction, we stayed in this one place almost the whole time. We hijacked JF's computer speakers and put on our own, non-black music. A couple of people came in here and there. But god damnit next time I am going to try to SOCIALIZE more. I did more last night than ever before though, I think. So I'm getting there I guess. Anyway, enough boring awkward emo crap, here are some fucking pictures.

Our host, the great Vin ""permanently erect nipples"" Diesel, aka JF.

I forget this guy's name but he hung out in our room for a while and was cool. He did a beatbox version of Iron Maiden's Fear of the Dark and Darude's Sandstorm. It was fucking rad.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF4.jpg"">

AIR DRUMS!

Here is Lawrence doing a super cool guitar solo:

:O

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF11.jpg"">
SEE PEOPLE DID HANG OUT WITH US IT'S A GIIIIIIIRL. I think she was waiting for the bathroom. There was a girl there that liked Apocalyptica and Stratovarius. She disappeared because apparently we sucked i guess.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF12.jpg"">
Air keyboard (playing the safety dance). We play all the fucking air instruments.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF13.jpg"">
Then we put on some hardcore and I did a ninja kick, hit my foot off the desk and fell to the floor. I am not drunk.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF15.jpg"">
Then my good pal Chris appeared! He's that guy that I convinced toothpaste would fuck him up good and he ate an entire tube. Then someone else made him drink their pee. He's a cool dude...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF16.jpg"">
...WITH A HORRIBLY DISFIGURED PINKY! Seriously I hadn't noticed until I saw it flash by when I watched the tape. Scary.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF17.jpg"">
yo yo yo egghead diesel in the hizzouse

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF20.jpg"">
This man is about 4 feet tall. How come everyone is going \m/ in ALL OF THESE PICTURES?

Then JF stole the camera from me and went to film the cool people.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF22.jpg"">

After that he told rabbit guy to ""go give it back to Chris"" (me) and there are about ten minutes of this:
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF23.jpg"">
with him going ""who's chris?"" over and over.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF24.jpg"">
oh no! sorry little girl you've got the wrong room this is the uncool room you want the cool room, down the hall

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF25.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-dance.gif"">

Then we found Vin's weights and beatbox dude decided to try to lift them
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/partyjf/partyJF27.jpg"">

And that's about it. Around 5AM, me, Lawrence and these two other guys went with the two girls I talked to at the beginning of the evening and we walked them to their bus stop because we are gentlemen and they were going to get lost/attacked. Then me and Lawrence walked to the metro which was just opening. I went home, he went to...work. Today was his last day, so he wanted to go out in a blaze of exhausted, semi-hungover glory. 

I think I had other things to talk about but I'm getting tired. I have to read a book for monday and it blows. I guess I'll do that tomorrow. If I remember anything important I wanted to talk about, I'll post again tomorrow.

I have some kind of paper to write for PE. It's worth 20-30%. Yes you heard right, for PE. It's called PAP and I forget what the letters stand for in this case but it makes me laugh. Something something program. We did these tests to see how in shape we are and now we have to write about what we need to fix and how and stuff. For the running test thing I did 8 minutes, and I needed 8.5 to pass. But that's not all! We did other tests that didn't count for our grade, but they will when we do them again at the end of the semester. The worst one was the chin-ups thing. I did like one and a half. I needed 7 to get 6/10. God damn. I also failed the push-ups. I got 8/10 for sit-ups and the jumping thing though! ABS OF <i>STEEL!</i> Not really. Oh. They had this little machine (it's basically an ohmmeter I think) thing you hold and you enter your height/weight/age/gender and it tells you how much fat you have (SCIENCE! <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-science.gif"">). The problem is the balance over there is metric and the stupid machine is imperial and I messed up on the conversion in my head and I was off by like 15 pounds and I had 11.7% and I was like holy shit I went down like 6% since last year! Then I realized my error after I got home and I was supposed to take another fat test (on the internet) and then calculate the average and this second test gave me 18.1% (which is not good). I don't think I went down at all. Oh well, this is where the PAP comes in! That's right folks I'm not only going to write the stupid paper, but I'm going to try to follow the lies I'm going to write in it too!

Fuck, we have some kind of oral presentation to do for french class, and it can be about almost anything. Books, music, movies, other stuff. I hate that I never know what to pick. It's a team thing and I'm with this one guy and Xuan and he suggested doing it about some Sparta song or album or something. He said they had super good lyrics or something. I looked them up and they didn't seem particularly good. I don't know. I don't think we'd be able to talk about it for 15 continuous minutes. Maybe if we took a concept album (Scenes from a Memory, The Human Equation, In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 or something cool like that) and talked about the whole thing. OH, OR LIGHT OF DAY, DAY OF DARKNESS! I don't know.

I got a credit card. For ordering stuff off the internet without having to ask my mom or something. I am a grown-up now!!!! Actually my dad got a new one (with a low limit because he's scared when he buys things off the internet for some reason) and he got a second card on the same...credit...number...thing...and it is mine. So basically it's not even really my card. I had to call to have it activated after we got it in the mail and the lady was like ""okay i'm going to need the birthdate of the primary owner of the card"" and I was like uh... and she made fun of me. Bitch. I didn't know the year, and nobody knows what day he was born anyway (birth certificate says one day, his mom says another day).

I'm kind of sad. I don't know. I feel lonely. Next saturday Vin is having a party. Maybe being around people would cheer me up. Maybe sleep would cheer me up. I don't even know if I'm invited actually. The other day blakkie sends me a message on MSN saying something like ""hey mate you going to jean-francois' thing?"" and I was like wait what. Then friday I asked Lawrence about it and he was like ""yeah he told me about it he didn't say anything about you though"". So now I don't know. I guess we'll see.

"event","First week is over yaaaaaaay only 14 more to go and then bam I am out of there. And that means no more crap classes and most likely no more oral presentations!!! I'm not exactly sure where I'm going or what I'm going to study though. I have like a month to make a decision. I like math and physics, I guess. Math more than physics...I think. I wanted to go into pure math but I'm afraid there are very little jobs. I really don't want to teach. All these people around me are going into engineering. My dad has an EE degree, and I think he has a pretty cool job. Lawrence wants to go into music or something but he's missing some prerequisite classes because he like just realized he didn't like science anymore and he might be taking like a semester off or something I forgot what he said. Oh well, I'll think about it.

I figured out why I couldn't change my schedule. There is only ONE electronics group (there's like 15 people in the class) so I couldn't move that and that prevented like all the other courses from moving or something. Here it is because I think the internet cares when I am at school:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/horairehiver05.jpg"">

It's alright, I have people I know in most of my classes. None with Lawrence though. I have my 2nd semester chem lab partner and my 3rd semester bio lab partner in electronics. The chem one is going to be my electro lab partner because...at least he didn't almost blow us up multiple times right after saying ""holy shit dude what the hell am I doing I could have blown us up"". The teacher's a hottie too. Like 600 pounds of hottness.

In physics I have good ol' crazy Laurent. Last semester he was like ""hey these curtains smell good!"" and we all wondered why he got the idea to smell the curtains and eventually someone checked and they didn't SMELL LIKE ANYTHING!

In french and math I have Xuan, who I only kind of know. She was Laurent's lab partner in physics last semester and eventually, Lawrence, in a very obvious and futile attempt at getting in her pants, started doing all the stuff that could be done in pairs with her instead of me and I got stuck with Laurent, who is always completely lost until like right before an exam and then he does okay. He was really no help. 

Oh man I bet Lawrence gets jealous that I have her in two of my classes. He got mad when I told him that it annoyed me how, after every single test, Xuan would look all sad and be like oh no I'm going to fail and then BAM she'd ALWAYS get a better grade (like 95% or something) than the both of us. Once at lunch time, he brought his guitar and played for her and like tried to teach her how to play or something. It was so lame I almost puked. I don't have anyone I know in PE (f u quebec school system and all your PE classes), english or german. God damnit. 

Well fuck, I was going to take pictures but I can't find the camera and it's probably in my dad's room and he's asleep and crap. I got some t-shirts in the mail wednesday. Man I have a lot of clothes now! I have like...10 t-shirts. And 4 whole pairs of pants! I enjoy getting stuff from the internet. I don't know. It gives me something to look forward to I guess. Wow that sounds a lot more pathetic than I thought.

Okay, I've bored you enough, I'm going to go microwave some hot dogs or something. Yeah, you heard me.

LET THIS BE MY WRIIIIIIIT, OF MISANTHROPY, TO A THANKLESS WOOOORLD, OF MEN, WHO HAVE PERFECTEEED NOOOTHING, SAVE THE ART OOOF AAAAACCUUUSAAAAAATIOOOOON! WOE IS HE THAT FEELS COMPELLED TO PEEEN EVEN ONE. WORD. OF HATREEEEED!!!"

"event","I got my hair cut thursday. I tried to take pictures at some point and I just checked them and they suck and I'm definitely not taking one now. Lawrence came with me, because he wants to get his hair cut too, and he wanted to ask the hair person if she had any ideas or something. She wasn't very helpful. She said if he did something to his hair (I don't even know what the word means in french so I don't know what it is in english I'm not a hair specialist okay), he would look like <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/gerryboulet2.gif"">Gerry Boulet</a>. He was THRILLED. Then we filmed some more dancing stuff and we went to his house and watched Bring It On. What a great movie. 

I got home at like 1AM and I was going to go sleep and wake up at like 5AM so I could change my schedule early and then go back to sleep but then I couldn't sleep and so I stayed up until 4AM (when the school site thing opens) and then it told me there were no other possible schedules for the classes I have. So then I was like oh maybe it's not ready yet because it's 4AM so I'll wait for a little while and I waited and no, nothing happened. 

When my mom saw my schedule friday night, SHE got all angry and whiny about it. Oh no three 2-hour classes in a row from 8AM to 2PM how will you manage!?!? You have to eat!!! I told her I didn't care and there was nothing that could be done about it, but she still sounded mad. It was really weird. Then she played some solitaire on her computer.

Tonight I went out to a restaurant with my friends, for my birthday, which was almost a month ago. We have this thing where we go to a restaurant when it's someone's birthday and they (or their parents) have to pay for everyone else. I don't remember why. We used to do it in high school and Mr. Diesel's birthday is like in the middle of summer and he was ALWAYS gone camping or some crap and so he'd get free meals from us but he'd never have to pay for his birthday. We caught on to his evil scheme eventually and he's not invited anymore. Actually we don't even talk to him anymore. It's too bad though, I just learned the other day that He-Man was called Musclor in the french version and I really really wanted to call him that.

It was weird when we walked into the restaurant, there were a bunch of girls there and they all looked at me. Maybe it's the haircut. It felt cool. Our waiter was cool, he kept repeating like everything we said in this funny high-pitched voice. Ben got up and like fell over and Blakkie said something like ""okay, no more sake for you"" (in english...half the time she has no fucking idea what language she is speaking in) and the waiter was standing behind them and he repeated it in his weird voice and Ben fell over again laughing at it. We hung out here afterwards. We gave Ben that trendy girl frame with his picture in it. I actually really wanted to keep it (not with his picture in it), and he almost forgot it, but then Blakkie had to remind him just as they were leaving. Fucking bitch. 

Okay, time for bed now, I'm pretty tired. I might post some pictures tomorrow or something. Oh man, I found this video the other day this one guy posted in his journal when he was like freaking out or something (I lost it now though) and it sounded a lot like the crap I used to write last year when I was sad, only it was actually a guy talking to his camera and crying and all that stuff. It was horrible, I am never writing anything like that again (if you don't know what I'm talking about, it was either private entries or I didn't post it, but I know I wrote it). I feel alright now anyway, but just in case, someone please kick me if I do it again."

Apparently that laptop my mom got a while ago (I mentioned this in another entry) has a wireless network card AND there's an open one somewhere around here for some reason. So here I am on the interweb in the kitchen!!! There were like 5 wireless networks in the area (all secure) and one of them was called ""The Lovely Ladies of 1817"". Now, my street address is 1820/1822, so I kind of guessed it was their address and not REALLY REALLY old ladies chilling on the internet. So I looked across the street and...there's an 1815 and an 1819, but no 1817. So then I was all like HOLY SHIT GHOST INTERNET for a couple of minutes until I realized that there's also an 1817 on the street behind my house. Or there SHOULD be...I haven't checked yet. I guess it doesn't really matter. In other news, I got my new schedule today, and at some point tomorrow I should be able to change it. Because it sucks. Well, I've seen worse I guess. Anyway, I was planning on going to bed early and then waking up early tomorrow to try to get the better schedules before they're all gone. But I can't sleep, so now I'm thinking maybe I'll stay up all night instead...I don't really have anything to do anyway. Oh man, I haven't been on MSN messenger on a windows computer in a long time, and there are some options you don't have in the mac version, like the ability to make groups/rename them, and I had completely forgotten about the group that was made on my account. It made me smile. Anyway, guess I'll go watch some transformers or TV or something."

<lj-cut text=""I really get the feeling that I'm starting to lose interest in the whole letter-writing process"">

I've been looking through our tapes and crap and I have come to the conclusion that I have the most annoying voice ever. No, seriously, what the fuck? Anyway, I took screenshots, because I like those even though they are horrible quality but I DON'T CARE OKAY

We have this one thing where we go around dancing. Here we are on an escalator at the mall:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/dance1.jpg"">

LET'S GROOOVE TONIGHT PA PA PA PAAAAN nice hat eh

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/dance2.jpg"">

Then last night we went to my school which surprisingly was not empty there was this guy and this fat girl and I think they were on a date to my school or something anyway here i am dansing

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/dance3.jpg"">

Before that, we went bowling. I came in last on 2 out of 3 games, and I tied for the 1st place in the middle game. I'm pretty sure someone made some remark about how I wasn't very regular and I should eat more fiber.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/evilball.jpg"">

This is some kind of rapist ball I think it looks funny.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/strangle.jpg"">

something about this picture seems oddly familiar but i can't tell what it is but no honestly he's constantly choking/using some wrestling moves or whatever on her WE KNOW YOU LOVE HER DUDE, STOP PRETENDING YOU DON'T BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/loserface.jpg"">

>:(

I'm sure some of you probably think I keep posting pictures of myself falling because I think it's hilarious and it's really my little gimmick and I'm falling on purpose or faking it or something but I'm not. The truth is...I keep falling.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/fall.jpg"">

Then we went to Lawrence's house to make food. We made pizza. This is a pineapple/bacon pizza:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/pineapplepizza.jpg"">

And this is our super meat pizza with a sausages and pepperoni and bacon and...oh I think we had some kind of vegetable somewhere under there:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/ballpizza.jpg"">

They were pretty good, especially the second one. It was given two chinese thumbs up:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/2chinesethumbsup.jpg"">

which according to the internet is 0.294678 canadian thumbs up which i guess isn't that good really but honestly it was pretty good

"event","Wow I am so good at sleeping. I went to bed at like 9 last night and woke up at midnight and then didn't go to sleep until 4. I watched TV because I couldn't sleep anymore. On this show (I forget which one), they were wondering if speaking to your plants really did make them grow bigger or whatever, so they had little groups of plants and they played a recording of someone being nice to them to one of the groups, one of someone saying they sucked to another, and then two plant groups had music, one classical and one METAL. Guess which group had the biggest plants? THAT'S RIGHT, THE HEAVY METAL ONE. I guess Manowar was right, metal IS all that's real.

At 2AM, Killer Tomatoes Eat France! came on TV. I had to watch it. I don't know if it's because I was tired, but that was the most hilarious movie ever. Aside maybe from The Return of the Killer Tomatoes which I saw years ago at like 3AM and found hilarious. I liked the ""french"" people who couldn't even speak their own language right. Also they all had mustaches, berets and baguettes, and personally I think racial stereotypes are funny.

In closing, the other day I was reading some random ""POST FUNNY IMAGES HERE"" thread on the SA forums and...there was <a  href=""http://img73.exs.cx/img73/1420/salawrencebenblakkie0sp.jpg"">a picture</a> I took. And I wasn't the one who posted it (I did put it in my journal a while ago, though). This confused me and I still don't know what the hell is going on. Maybe they randomly found me or something. OR I AM BEING E-STALKED ON THE INTERWEB!!! 

OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH METAL, AND MASTERS, WE HAVE NONE! AND WE WILL DIIIIE FOOOOR MEEEEETAAAAAAL, METAL HEEEALS, MY SOOOOON!"

"event","I'm tired. I think I'm going to go to bed after I'm done writing this. Okay, so what's new? Not a lot...I am confusing all of my days because nothing happens. I can't figure out how to make that last sentence make sense. Maybe it already does and...oh god what the hell is going on.

Okay, saturday I did stuff. I went to the STADE UNIPRIX at like 3 and there were already people there. Then it got damn cold and I wasn't wearing a coat, just my sweater. People started fires in the line, but they didn't have wood, just paper and cardboard and crap, and pieces of burning/burnt paper kept floating up into the air and into my face. I wasn't even getting any heat from the fire(s). It was great. Oh christ, anybody remember <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/notemoatall/1963.html"">that guy that I think thinks I want to become him</a>? Well he was there. And he saw me. He looked angry. 

Anyway, eventually I got in and Unearth was awesome (and announced they were coming back (with Atreyu) in march, during my week off). I didn't get hit in the face by Ken's guitar this time, sadly. Also, Slipknot fans don't know what the fuck a circle pit is. The singer was like ""OKAY NOW EVERYONE START FUCKING MOVING *does circular motion with hand*"" and they were all like ""wha *keep pushing people*"". I think I saw ONE ninja kick. It was a sad sight my friends

I enjoyed Killswitch Engage too. I knew like 2 or 3 of their songs but I liked them and it was cool. Then I was pretty tired and I thought of just leaving but I went to get something to drink and stood more in the back instead and watched Slipknot. That's when I realized that, hey, I know all of this band's songs, and yet...I don't like them. Well, not anymore, anyway. They do run around and stuff on stage a lot and it was pretty cool to watch, but the music just wasn't any good, except for like 2 songs that I remember liking in like 8th grade. Also, for some reason, ALL of their fans that were at the show were ugly 14-year-old white trash with bad hair/facial hair (like mullets and shitstaches). I mistook a downy for a drunk. He was the prettiest of the bunch and I'm sad he didn't want to be my friend, but I'll be okay. 

Tomorrow I'm hanging out with my friends...and going bowling again. Hooray. Better than sitting around all day playing video games I guess. Going to bed now."

Here are the 4 DVDs I got:

Like I mentioned before, I am a chef. Then I was bored. Here are some screenshots from stuff that was filmed last week on new year's eve.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-1.jpg"">

Lawrence playing the geetar.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-10.jpg"">

ahahahaaha no comment

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-2.jpg"">

Blakkie trying to play the bongos or whatever to accompany Lawrence in his guitar playing, Ben strangling her.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-3.jpg"">

Then Ben started drinking.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-6.jpg"">

And called his mom.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-4.jpg"">

And claimed his head hurt. I told him he was from the future when it was actually tomorrow and he was already hungover. He didn't find it funny.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-7.jpg"">

Then he started humping everything.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-8.jpg"">

THEN IT WAS MSN TIME! ooooh yeeeeaaaah INTERNET

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-9.jpg"">

Lawrence and Blakkie deep in coversation about whether or not Jesus was black. No, seriously. She was convinced he was black.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-5.jpg"">

Someone stole the camera from me at some point. It looks like a documentary where I speak about some horrible event that happened to me or something.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-13.jpg"">

THEN, UNBEKNOWNST TO ME,  BEN WANTED TO HUMP ME ALSO p.s. there's something wrong with my hair

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-12.jpg"">

so then I used my super strength to flip the situation around I guess it doesn't really show in a picture but I AM IN CONTROL HERE

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/Untitled-11.jpg"">

and then using my manly muscles I lifted him up off the ground

In conclusion, I am a manly man and Ben is a lightweight drunkard.

P.S.: oh hey it's january 6th I haven't had a hug in a year <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-waycool.gif"">

"event","Today is the most boring day ever. I'm actually seriously considering cleaning my room right now. Anyway, friday we were supposed to go to the movies and then hang out or something, because it was new year's eve. For some reason, the movie we wanted to see wasn't playing that day. God damnit. So we went to Lawrence's house and we hung out. It was pretty cool. I stumbled home at like 3AM and woke up at 8AM. It wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't feel so god damn sick. I spent the whole day trying not to puke. 

That day, I went with my parents to see my grandfather and stuff...it was okay, I guess. We ate at the old people cafeteria thing...again. They actually have pretty decent food, I guess. Then we hung out in his little apartment thing. The TV was on so I watched while my grandpa told the same old stories over and over. My dad told him the same story twice and I wasn't exactly sure which one of them was more senile. Anyway, the TV was on some sports channel, and I couldn't really change it, so I watched some fat guy bowl. Then there was some show about how to play hockey safely. I thought it was pretty funny. They repeated ""concussion"" at least a million times. They had like two main injuries they talked about, concussions and spine injuries, and at some point they were talking about concussions (again), then the guy said ""In addition to spine injuries, there are also concussions which can be dangerous"" and then kept on talking about concussions. I laughed...yeah I was pretty tired. At least now if I ever play hockey, I know how to not get a concussion! Then I fell asleep on the couch, and we left. Then I fell asleep in the car. I fell asleep again right after supper (at about 7-8) and woke up at noon the next day. I'm better now.

Yesterday, me and Lawrence went to film some stuff...then we saw Fat Albert. It was pretty funny. IT HAD OMARION! No lil' fizz though that made me sad. OMG IT ALSO HAD BENJI YAY GOOD CHARLOTTE!!!! That reminds me, the other day on TV they mentioned that one guy from good charlotte's clothing line and they said level 21 but it's level 27!!!! Yeah okay you've seen through my cunning plan I am B2K/GC's #1 fan.

Anyway, there were about 10 people in the theater. I put my feet up on the seat in front of me, and when this little asian woman walked in front of my feet, she tripped and fell. Nobody else heard it, but when she got up I SWEAR she said ""buttcheeks"". 

I think I'm going to go clean my room for real now. I might write more later I don't know. I don't think anyone cares anyway.

<lj-cut text=""CLICK HERE FOGHATS"">

I AM OUT OF SCHOOL AND HAVE BEEN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS!!! Tuesday I did stuff with my friends. I have not done anything else since. Well I think I showered, but I'm not sure. I probably ate some stuff too. Anyway, I will now attempt to remember what we did by going through some pictures I took or something.

Okay, so people were supposed to come over, as usual. Ben got here first and did what he always does...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4882.jpg"">

...he got on MSN to talk to his bitches. Then Blakkie got here and she...

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4887.jpg"">

sat down and watched Ben talk to his bitches on MSN. <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/emot-waycool.gif"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4890.jpg"">

OH GOD NO

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4893.jpg"">

hey guys my name's ben I think I'm cool 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4901.jpg"">

Then Lawrence got here and drank some water and did some face I guess.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4906.jpg"">

yeah I don't know what the fuck either

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4910.jpg"">

PEACE UP, A-TOWN DOWN

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4912.jpg"">

HAHA, BEN IS A HOMOSEXUAL!

Then we went bowling. The following pictures suck because there was some blacklight shit and so either the pictures are really dark in the background or they are purple and blurry.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4946.jpg"">

i fell shut the fuck up

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4955.jpg"">

I don't know what the hell he's pointing at but that is a MEGA COOL POSE DUDE

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4937.jpg"">

hey ever wonder what emo looks like in blacklight? me neither

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4977.jpg"">

Here is the score from the last game. I got beaten by the worst bowling player in the world, some asian pointing guy and this other bearded guy who was playing for the first time in 10 years. By the way that says ""zizz"" not ""jizz"", and no I don't know what it means either.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4986.jpg"">

Annie used to say Lawrence looked like Legolas. What a dumb bitch.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4987.jpg"">

Apparently in cat world, the BLACK MAN is keeping WHITEY down, instead of the other way around. Or maybe those cats are doing it I don't know what the shit

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4988.jpg"">

hello Ben's mother this is Ben I am speaking to you in chinese

I guess that's it for that day. Yesterday, we put up the tree!

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4995.jpg"">

Looking COOL with our fake plastic tree EH? I broke the thing on top so there's some crappy dollar store something on top now.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4990.jpg"">

HEY I'M TIRED SHOULD I GO IN SOMEONE'S BED OR ON A PILE OF CLOTHES MMMMM OH HEY HERE ARE SOME HARD BOXES I'M GOING TO GO SLEEP ON THOSE

Then today we had some kind of christmas supper as a family or something.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5009.jpg"">

sorry midget cat you're not tall enough to reach the food

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5016.jpg"">

Then later on my dad gave him a shitload of it and then he went to sleep in a cardboard box in true hobocat fashion. My mom got us those kinder surprise chocolate things. I got this crap:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5024.jpg"">

I think it's supposed to be a ghost or something. We opened presents at some point...I got this:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5021.jpg"">

and these:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5018.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5020.jpg"">

My birthday stuff (some DVDs) is in the mail somewhere...I guess I'll get it eventually. Last night I got kind of depressed because it was christmas and I was alone and crap, and so I went for a walk. 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5033.jpg"">

I found a piece of rope tied into some crazy ass knot and I really tried to undo it but I couldn't so I put it in my pocket thinking it was a crazy un-doable knot and I just found it again and it took me 3 seconds to start untying it and so I stopped and I'm just going to keep pretending it is MAGICAL. Oh also I slipped on some ice going back home last night and I hurt a hell of a fucking lot. My left leg is purple and swollen. Good job! 

Now it's my birthday! I am 19 years old. Great. Actually I still feel pretty down. Whatever, I don't really want to talk about it.

I went shopping with my mom the other day. I got some NEW PANTS! Something came with them:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5022.jpg"">

I think it's supposed to be a bracelet or something...I don't know, I think it's weird. Speaking of confusing, I got a NEW COAT ALSO! Fucking finally. It is brown. I know, that sounds ugly, but it's pretty nice. It's also not fucking huge like my ugly blue one.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5025.jpg"">

It has some bright pink stuff on the inside

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5029.jpg"">

Oh yeah, the confusing part...this thing needs a fucking instruction manual. There's a bunch of weird-ass pockets and buttons that obviously have a very precise purpose but I don't know what the fuck it is. Also, this thing:

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN5031.jpg"">

Some kind of hook-type thing on a retractable chord. I feel like BATMAN!

That about sums up all the crap I could come up with. Oh man I can't wait until the 8th. Why, you ask? Have you been fucking listening to what I've been saying I reply and then I beat you up the end

"event","Dear journal,

I have been too busy/lazy to write in you, so I didn't. Right now I should be studying but I don't feel like it so I guess I'll write for a bit. I'm kind of tired. The last two weeks were pretty bad, I had something to do for the next day like every night, and I didn't sleep a lot. Now I only have one more exam to do, and then it'll be done, finally. It was weird though, yesterday I was not tired at all. It was my most productive day in a long while. I cleaned my room, I washed dishes, I washed my hair, I cut my nails, I made bread (I AM A CHEF!), I went to the mall. Coming back from the mall, on three corners in a row I got something from people handing out things. I got something about Jesus, some chocolate bar and those little listerine strips things. It was cool. Later on Lawrence came over...then he took over my MSN and talked to people while I did other things. He talked to annie for a really long time, for some reason. He also agreed, in a drunken haze, to go visit her at her job the next day. Man he's a lightweight. Anyway, we needed a gift for Ben, so we went, because we thought maybe there was something for him at the store she works at. We got him <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4881.jpg"">this</a>. She gave us these <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4868.jpg"">candies</a> that, at first, I thought were urinal cakes. Damn crazy asian candy.

Last thursday me and Lawrence went to see Nightwish. It was great, except for this retard that was trying to get in the front row (where we were) and he was like trying to squeeze in between us and he was obviously on crack and he kept making these ""AAAAAAAAAGH"" noises. I wanted to punch him so bad. The opening band, Trance of Mine, was horrible. Well, maybe not horrible, but they were a small local band and they just weren't very good. Anyway, Nightwish was excellent, even though the singer wasn't feeling well and they had to cut the show short. I got Tuomas' used towel! I was so proud to have ripped it out of the faggot crackhead next to me's hands. That's about all I had to say about the show...oh, the security guy I talked to last time was there and he recognized me! I have friends!!!! Here are some pictures I found on the interweb that someone took of the show from the night before (they played two nights here): <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/nightwish5.jpg"">1</a> (Tuomas on the left, security guy dude bottom right) and <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/nightwish.jpg"">2</a> (the security guy dude like next to Tarja's foot is the one that poked me in the eye last time...asshole).

Oh, I got a cellphone, for some reason. My mom lent some money to a friend and he bought a laptop and two cellphones with it. Eventually he couldn't pay for the laptop anymore so my mom took it...she said she needed a new laptop anyway, but I'm not sure I believe her. About the two cellphones, he was in a long-distance relationship with this girl who lived in Toronto I think and there's some kind of plan with unlimited minutes between two cellphones or something, so he gave one to her. Then they broke up. They didn't need them anymore (and couldn't afford them) so he asked my mom to cancel their contract with the phone company, but that would have cost a lot of money so my mom just took both phones. So...now I have a CELLIE! Oh man I'm part of the cool crowd now. <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4834.jpg"">Here</a> is a picture of my mobile cellular telephone unit. I've had it for like 3 weeks now and no people have called. It's going to be so useful. If anybody wants the number so they can REACH ME in the case of AN EMERGENCY then just ask for it or something.

I don't really have much else to say...it's going to be christmas again soon...I haven't bought anything for anyone. Well, I guess that's not true, I bought something for me. I asked my mom for something and she told me she wouldn't have the time to go buy it so she asked me if I could go and she'd pay it back. That's kind of sad, I think. Oh christmas spirit, you're such a card. I don't think we're going to put up the tree or anything...oh, or the climbing santa dude, since someone fucking sawed off one of its legs. That was not cool. Anyway, I guess I'll write again later this week...we're supposed to partay because it's the end of the semester/christmas and stuff. And then another one for my birthday/new year's later on. We suck at parties though...it's probably going to just be me, Lawrence, Ben and Blakkie again. Party hard.

the end I have to go study now

Well, this was actually a pretty good week, although I don't really know why. Monday was a wednesday, wednesday was a wednesday, and thursday I didn't have my Math class in the morning so I got THREE DAYS when I got to wake up later!!!! I suppose that helped. I had a bunch of exams though...and an oral on wednesday. It actually went pretty good! It was a team thing but the teacher said our presentation in general was excellent...I didn't do so well for my part (I was kind of shaking) so I guess it was at least good. I am so proud. But then thursday night I didn't sleep a lot and so I didn't feel so good friday during the day. I went to bed at 9...and woke up at noon saturday. 

Saturday night I was supposed to do something with Lawrence, Ben and Blakkie (we now spell it this way because of the second man from on the right in <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/ves1.jpg"">this picture</a>) but Ben said he had to ""study"" (most likely meaning ""talk to his girlfriend on the phone""...asshole) so he didn't come. And once again, we got started on doing things too late and the earliest we could go to the movies was 9:20, meaning it was 11:30 when we got out of the movies, and Blakkie had to leave. So then it was just me and Lawrence, again. We played some Megaman 2 and...5 I think. Then he left.

...I just realized I have not said one word about the show. It was not as good as last time, but it was pretty good. TBS is horrible, though. Oh god it was awful. But anyway, I got out of school at noon and so I sat around for an hour and then decided I would go see if there were any people there. There weren't. I went to eat and slowly walked back there...still no one. I walked around...trying to kill time. I really didn't want to be first in line. Apparently no one else does. At about 3, I walked by again and I saw three people standing there, including the security guy, so I went and stood by. The two guys in front of me were from Ottawa, and the security guy was like ""...the doors open in like 4 hours, go walk around or something, since you're not from here""...so they left. And so...I was first in line, against my will. I talked with the security guy dude for a while, he was pretty nice. This guy wearing a suit and gloves and sunglasses came by later on and he was like ""I need two tickets for my boss for [something]"" and the security guy was like ""Sorry, the box office is closed right now, but you can go buy tickets at [some other place like 5 minutes away]"" and the suit guy said ""No, that's too far. Listen, my boss knows the guy who owns this place, and I need these tickets for him or he will not be happy."" but security guy really could no do anything about it and suit guy left eventually. He said to me something like ""jesus, what the hell was up with that guy?"" and I told him I thought he looked like Patrick Bateman and he actually knew what I was talking about! That was pretty cool. Then FINALLY someone came up and stood behind me in line. We started talking about the various bands playing and stuff, and then he was like ""Man, it's like no one wanted to be first in line or something. I was walking around here and I saw these two girls and they were looking around and it seemed like they were there for the show but they left and went to do other things. I didn't want to be first in line either so I went to the Eaton centre and I saw them there! Oh and I saw you walking around here earlier too. I'm glad you broke the ice, though."" and then I was like ""yeah I was tricked into it <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/mad.gif"">"".

 Anyway, later on the two dudes from Ontario came back and we talked for a while, the four of us. I KIND OF MADE FRIENDS!!! I was so happy. Then we waited for hours. Last Atreyu show I went to, I stood in line next to a girl who was saving spots for her friends, and eventually one of them came by and so he stood like, almost in front of me (facing me) for a couple of hours. I saw him again monday, and he gave me a ""where the fuck do I know you from?"" look, even though I've never talked to him or anything. He looked really confused. We went inside eventually, and I was kind of disappointed because they had a barricade/trench thing, and those suck. Anyway, Funeral for a Friend was pretty good. Then Atreyu, which was great. They had the guy from FFAF come back to help do the last part of Lip Gloss and Black, that was pretty cool. Oh and the new bassist (not so new anymore, he was at the last show) is fucking awesome and breakdances while he plays.

Then...TBS. I only kind of like ONE of their songs...and they didn't play it. Also, their singer apparently loves to twirl the mic around...and wraps the chord around his neck and stuff. Every couple of songs, one of the techs had to run out on stage to untangle that fucking mess, and he looked really pissed off. I thought it was hilarious. Oh, and maybe I'm getting old, but the music didn't really feel all that loud. The little girls screaming about how they wanted to marry TBS' singer are the only reason my ears were ringing after, I think. Oh god they were loud. The singer also said in between songs that he really liked our outfits. He was probably talking mainly about the people in front (because he could see them better) and so my outfit is now officially gay-approved! Hoooray! 

Anyway, even though that wasn't so great, it was worth it for the social interaction alone. I talked to people I didn't know!!! And...maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but I think being in a large crowd at a show like this is like a giant, slightly violent group hug. I like it, despite the bruises. Better than being alone. Okay, maybe I'm crazy.

I'm going to see Nightwish on december 16th...that should be pretty cool. Even more awesome, january 8th...UNEARTH! And Killswitch Engage! And...Slipknot. I don't really like Slipknot that much anymore, but it will still be fucking awesome. That's about it for this week...we finished doing the remastered version of MATS and started filming one of the other projects...I think it's too late for my DDR segment and unless we can wait until next summer, it will never get done. That sucks, it was going to be fucking awesome.

I'm sick and I have a fever. I'm going to bed as soon as I'm done with this. My eyes feel like they are on fire, which is pretty awesome I think. I finally got off my ass and went to the optometrist. I didn't take a picture of my new glasses, I'll do it some other time. Here are the old ones though, all broken and taped:

I've had the new ones for like a week and no one commented on them. They're different, I swear! They're...black. I tried emo glasses but they didn't go well with my face, so I took those instead. Also, next monday is a wednesday because of the strike a while ago, which means I can be at the show super early. We have these oral presentations in french starting monday but mine is wednesday. The teacher said if we were present at all the presentations and asked questions, we would receive some extra credit. I know I'm not going to ask any questions anyway, so I'm not going monday, or the week after that.

I'm pretty sure I mentioned that guy in my english class who had the same belt/wore same brand clothes as me before...anyway, the other day in that class, I had my <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v94/failureinside/DSCN4749.jpg"">new white belt</a> (which is exactly like the black one...only white), and he was like hey nice belt man and I was like haha yeah I noticed you had the same one in black and then I noticed he was wearing the white version as well. WELL ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE

Speaking of people in my english class, my team for that oral on that novel is awesome. There's this one guy in my team who's always poking at his septum retainer and it looks like he's constantly picking his nose. It makes me laugh. Also there's this one girl who is either pregnant or has horrible posture/back problems (lordosis I think it's called), I can't tell and am too scared to ask. It's weird.

Okay I really don't feel good so here are some pictures and then bed.

I have a new zip-up hoodie type thing. I think it's cool. Also I like this shirt. That reminds me, until like a month ago, I had never seen my lab partner in bio wear the same t-shirt twice. I see him like 4 days a week! Fucking crazy.

THIS is what I look like when I rock out? ...And then I wonder why I don't have any friends.

That wet spot in the corner is most likely urine. Also check out my mad skills!

I'm pretty sure I mentioned our ""worst muffin ever"" experiment before. Here is a screenshot of me right before I almost puked it back up. As you can see, the ones on the table (the ""good"" ones) don't look that great either. Anyway, that's about it, bed time. Here's a bonus oldschool picture because I think it's funny:

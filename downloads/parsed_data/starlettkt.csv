We simply have too much fun, but hell.. there is no other way to live. We only live once, right? Might as well have fun, spend time with amazing people, do things we love, and experience amazing things. thats what its all about. no regrets.

I am addicted to attractive, absolutely amazing men. Honestly, all of you.. stop being so goddamn cute and witty. You suck.
I dont like how I am far too comfortable. You suck.
*
On a different note, there will be a new years party at Kayte and my place this year. and there will be another type of party that we will not mention, but for all of you who apply.. will be invited. 
*
I'm stoked for xmas- I got some crazy amazing shit for people.

This update was lame, deal with it."

I've seen this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and broken Hallelujah

There was a time when you let me know,
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember when I moved in you,
And the holy dove was moving too?
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

"event","so its been an interesting past couple of weeks. I'm an old lady, yes, I've started walking with a cane. I am even looking into getting a scooter. those are fun. birthdays are interesting, they really get you thinking about the past. I still havent decided if that is a good or bad thing. I guess for the most part good... even though my mind is a little clouded and I tend to remember the good things about people even if the bad weight in heavily. I guess I'd just rather see the good?
 aaaaaaanyways. I really do want to thank every one who came out to make it a fun night. For people who had good excuses and really couldnt make it, I understand. For the people who blew it off like nothing.... I'll just say what you pretty much said to me by that... F you. 
I am a damn good friend to all of my friends, and I dont think that my bday being blown off is something that a good friend would do. So please, if you are one of the people that are being referred to here, dont consider me a very good friend, if one at all. I give what I get. I'm sure I've done things for you that were inconvenient for me at the time, but being a FRIEND, I did it. I am not saying I am a saint or anything close to one, but I was there. and still am if you need me,  because I am just that stupid. I'd do anything for my friends. 

So again, for all of you who were there(or who really wished they couldve been but it was impossible), thankyousomuch. I <3 you all.


bah. ok, I'm good now.
So turkey day is this week and that = friends being home. which = =)
I dont even know whats going on for thanksgiving. usually my family all gets together and we have the best time, but this year it isnt so great =/
I guess my favorite holiday wont be so favorite this year.

Went to best buy today (and saw tasha haha) with Mel and got my mom's bday present and i finally bought wayne's world 1 and 2. how I didnt own them before, I'll never know. 
I'm seriously considering  selling the episodes I have of SATC on ebay so I can just get the box set and call it a day. It makes so much more sense. oh well. clutter can be fun i guess. 
I'm on a mini vacay from work cause people are home from college for the week. so I get a break, amaaaaaaaazing. I have one more day to go until its time to go back. and YES, three days is most def. a vacation. 
Ink is almost completely healed. Its just itching like crazy and I'm sure I look crazy slapping myself in the back of the neck all day.
I think tomorrow = a lazy lazy day. I got a lot done this weekend, so itll be nice to lay around all day doing nothing and not feel TOO terrible about it."

"event","holy shit look who is baaaaaaaack. Okay so its been like, years. or something. I figured, lets just start back up, why the fuck not. It was fun playing around and trying to customize this thing, but i cant quite find what I want. bleh.
Okay, quick update.
So I am single and looooooooooooving it. So much fun, carefree, all that great crap. 
I took the semester off of school and am working full time and i love it way too much. My job is amazing. Eventually I'm going to have to go back to get my doctorate, but I'm not rushing. Unless I move to Japan with my kii =)
I will finally be 21 in like a week, its taking far too long to get there. It just needs to be over with so that I can be old and live my life. I already feel like I'm 30, anyway. I got my first bday card.. from FOB. how cute are they? and my first present was frank paying for my car wash. he wouldnt take my money. 
Friday Kii and Tricia and I are going to get our tattoos. We had to make an appt. because the place was so busy. I'm just going to be adding on to mine. Outlining it and then I'll go back for the color. The price they gave me isnt bad at all, so I'm excited. 
Holly and Kirk are FINALLY fucking married. It'll be their 6 month anniversary on my bday. It's a little weird calling her my sister-in-law, but I'm getting used to it. They are adorable. I practically live at their place, we have fun. 
I got a car a while ago, and I'm in love with it. The name is even absolutely amazing. Its an X-men character. Mystique. I <3 it. yea.. its not really a hooptie, but its still my little hooptie. Its got amazing pick up and even more amazing gas mileage. 
Went to some amazing shows this year. my favorite was by FAR U2 with my kii.  That was the most amazing night ever, and U2 rocks my socks like no one else. The lights and everything were astronomical. We might've sat with God, but it was still the best show I'm ever seen/will see. 
Went to see my husband with kii. ( he had some-what of a mullet, I was not thrilled..*pukes*.)
I also went with kiitten and Tricia to see Weezer and taking back sunday. amazing show, I was quite happy being in the pit. except for some creepy young boy who tried hitting on me. let me tell you, its not fun when theres No where for you to go, you cant get away.  We were a little bored with some of the new material from weezer, but the older stuff.. wow, that was awesome. I still <3 them. 
Nintendo Fusion tour was also amazing. Motion City Soundtrack and FOB were UNBELIEVABLY amazing. I was really impressed with Panic! at the Disco. amazing band.  Live music rocks my world.
yea so I'm sure theres more.. but I'm hungry."

I'm still bitter towards you for it.. and I dont even know why. We were such good friends. Our conversations were so real. The fun we had..Its terrible to even think about it. I wonder if I'll ever see you.. awkwardness. You once made my heart move. I know that if I ever see you again, my heart will stop.
How we could keep in touch ten hours away.. or even when I was on the other side of the world, I'll never know. Or even when you were in London, it was there. So suddenly it wasn't. I guess it slowly drifted its way into nothing-ness. How through all that time the space was so good for us, and now.. it doesn't mean anything at all. Now that space is all that's there. I guess once that coffee shop closed, our bond did, too. Such a sad relation. Such a sad What if."

"event","So its been a while, but I started my new job and it had kept me VERY busy. Its been an exciting past few days. Thursday was Rob and my one year anniversary, he came over for a bit that night after work, but we celebrated on Friday because we both had to work Thursday. Friday he came over, we hung out for a while, went out to dinner, and then we went to the mall. I actually went shopping for the first time in a while. I mainly just bought stuff for work and a new pair of jeans. After the mall we went to buy ice cream at the A&P and then went back to Rob's for a bit. We called Kenny and ended up going over to his house for a bit to hang out. Then Rob and I left early to come back to my house for a bit hehe. Saturday I got up early and went grocery shopping with my sister.  I cooked dinner with my mother to take next door to celebrate my grandmother's birthday, which was also on Thursday. Hmm.. Sunday I had to work until 5, then Rob met me at my house and I drove to my grandparent's in Stratford to meet up with everyone. I wanted to go this weekend because I can't next Sunday, I'm working 430-11. So Monday I had to get up early, ran errands with my sister, went to the office for a bit, got Duchess for lunch.. Then we came home, Rob came over, and we went next door to have coffee with my grandma. Rob took me to the doctor at 4 because I've been having really bad pain in my kidneys. Figures, I have a kidney infection and now I'm on one of the highest doses of antibiotics possible. So after the doctor, Rob and I went to go to the Trumbull mall, but the traffic was so bad we turned around and came home. We went again around 7, I drove. So I went to buy my favorite bra, because mine broke. And OH!! good news!!!!!! My boobs grew! I am now a B cup! Holy crap, I thought it would never happen. So I'm really excited haha. So I'm just gonna have a lazy day today, lay around, do my nails.. because later I have a date with Rob's mom.=). We're going to watch the finale of Outback Jack. So I am going to go Relax because I have to work allll day tomorrow."

"event","Sunday night, you think I'd be able to sleep? naaahhh! So I will update. Ok, so... Wed. I went to pee in a cup for my job, haha. Yay! Drug test that I will TOTALLY pass. So I should hear early this week about when I can start and what not. Soooo excited. Thursday night I babysat for Sasha. CUTEST little boy EVER. He loves me, and wouldn't let go of me. My aunt even paid me for time she was THERE. wtf is that about? I hate taking money from family, it was a favor! It was good money though, so I can't complain. So I get home from babysitting around 10:30, I call Rob and he's like ""I'm on my way, we're sleeping over Rachel's"" lol I'm like OKAY! So my mother complains that I'm not going to be home and she never sees me, and then a second later picks up the phone and calls my sister. Great, biatch, so I'm never home and u wanna see me, so the time I AM home, you spend on the phone. Have fun, I'm gone. So I packed my stuff and Rob got here with Heather and we left. Didn't get the Rach's until like midnight, and I was already exhausted from chasing around an almost 2 yr. old all night. So lets see, it was Rachel, Rob, Alex, Ken, Heather, and Sophia showed up later. I dont think I'm missing anyone, oh yea, and me too, duh. So we're hangin out, Heather and Alex were dancing, it was quite the entertainment. Then we had to bring Heather home, Alex stayed and talked Ken (hehehe) who had to leave soon. We got back and Rachel had this great idea that she wanted her ex boyfriend to come over for a hook-up. GREAT! So we leave her house at like 1am to pick up this kid that is sneaking out of his house. CAN I JUST SAY, I met Jason Mraz, cause HOLY CRAP this kid is like HIS TWIN. So I called him Mr. Mraz for the night. So Rachel and this kid went upstairs into the extra bedroom and hooked up for like AN HOUR while we all hung out downstairs. We decided we were tired, so we all just went to bed while they were having fun. So an hour later Rachel comes down and is like ""Rob, can you bring Josh home?"" Hi, It's like 3 in the morning. So Rob gets up (not wanting to) and I was like f*ck that, I'm sleeping. So apparently after they got back from driving Mr. Mraz home, they(Rob and Rach) stayed up for like another 45 min and talked for orange juice. So Rob didnt get to sleep until 4, hahaha. Ok, so we wake up.. Rob's mother came to pick up Alex for her voice lessons and then Rob and I went to run like two errands and back to his house to eat lunch. Then we came back to my house where we had some alone time, hehe. Then Rob left for a bit to go jam with some band, while I did stuff. I talked to my kii on line for a while and decided we were going to go to dinner. So Rob got here and we picked up the kiitten, went to Bertucci's and sat in the car for an hour and 45 min. just talking before even going INTO the restraunt. So we finally ate and it wad yummy, then we drove my Kii home and came back here where we fell asleep. I was dead to the world. So Rob left and I washed up and PASSED THE F OUT. Yay for sleep. So Sat. afternoon I went with My kii to lunch at Friendly's where I ate FAR TOO MUCH. That is what PMS will do to you. Then she went to Grieb's while I stayed in the car completely forgetting it was SAt. and I totally could've gone in, whatever. So she took me home and I layed down and took a nap because I had a migraine. Woke up at about 445 when the mom got home from work, got ready and went to dinner next door to eat MORE. My grandmother does make some bangin' ribs, but I really shouldnt have gone near them considering I ate a week's worth of food only a few hours earlier. So I loaded the dishwasher and came home to wait for Rob. Took a shower.. then we left to go to his house where we waited patiently for the late Dayon. Yes, he got lost. So Rob, Dayon, Alex and I went to pick up Cat, and parked in Tower parking lot. Rob called Ken (Alex's crush) to see what he was doing, but he was at the bar with a few of his friends. So we called Kirk and Holly and they met us at Stamford diner. When we got there Alex sanguanetti (sp?, yea I have no idea) called Alex and she said to meet us there. We all had the best, yet, the most INTERESTING conversations, and well, it was a good time. While at the diner with everyone, I started to feel so sick (I had eatten about a month's worth of food in one day already), so genius me, thought OH! I'll get an english muffin to settle my stomach. Then some soup..Yea... bad idea. I got really nauscious and decided to sleep over Rob's cause I really didnt feel like sitting in the car on the way home wanting to puke the whole time. So Rob, Alex, Cat, Dayon and I went back to Rob's and hung out for a while with their mom (who IS the coolest lady ever). We played a dirty question game thingy, and Rob went to bed cause he had work this morning. So after a bit I still felt like crap, and decided to go to bed, too. So I went into bed and Rob and I talked for a few and then I finally passed out like an HOUR later. Rob woke me up to say goodbye before work and I passed back out.  Woke up kinda early, hung out with his momma, then Kirk and Holly came to pick me up around 1145. Went to Dunkin Donuts and then came home to get ready, went to the grands. We got chinese food for dinner. Yum. Even though food just makes me feel sick. (No worries, no babies on the way here). So I came home, talked to Rob for a bit, watched some tv, talked to a few people on line. I've tried sleeping, but its just not working out. I think I may try again though.. it might be fun. Besides, this entry turned out to be a book, ENJOY TASHA!"

"event","So yay. The weekend is over and it's time for a new week. Friday Rob came over for a bit, then we picked up his friend Sean and went to see Spider man 2. We were a little late picking up Sean, hehe, but we made it on time to the movie. It was a pretty good movie, I enjoyed it. Dropped off Sean then stopped home to get a few things that I forgot and got an AWFUL surprise at my home. I am traumatized, for life. Went back to Rob's for a bit, then we went to Pick up Alex and people from Shakespear on the green. Then we went back to pick up Sean. Rob, Alex, Sean, Rachel, Sophia, Cat, and I went to Stamford diner to meet up with more people. Hung out there for a bit, dropped Rachel and Sean home and then went home. Rob and I lounged around and snuggled on the couch for a while before going to sleep. I got NO sleep. Must've been the trauma I went through haha. We were going to go to the gym Sat. morning, but we were all FAR too tired. So we all got ready and went to Barb and Bill's wedding. It was veeery nice. Barb slept over too Fri. night so we had to make sure she was ready before anyone. The wedding was nice, small and casual, it was sweet. I kinda just sat there for most of the time cause I didnt really know that many people. Just some of Rob's family. They insisted I had to be in the professional family pictures, cause I'm part of the family. I felt really bad though, legally I'm NOT part of the family. I hope they didnt make me do it just so I didnt feel left out.. It was nice though. So we stayed at the wedding for a while.. Rob played guitar and it sounded awesome, even on his little shitty amp. hehe. Alex sang after the vows, and she sounded amazing as usual. I had a few glasses of wine and a few sips of champaign. I was fine, but Alex got drruuuuunnk off of three glasses of white wine. I was worried, lol. So after cake and all we went over Rachel's and Rob's for his late graduation party. It was mostly their family but it was fun. We ended up playing 6th grade games like suck and blow and spin the bottle. It was an interesting night. Then Rob and I picked up my stuff from his home and he brought me home which I was not happy about considering the night before's events. Today I got up early to finish making deviled eggs, cause Holly asked me to bring them to the party today. Holly and Kirk's families got together today for a little pre-wedding party (a year in advance) so that the families could meet and all. It was fun, Holly's uncle Dale and my aunt Chris pulled me into the pool with all of my clothes on. It was interesting considering I was wearing a white skirt... We had fun though. I'm babysitting on Thursday night for Sasha, and I cant wait. So today I got home, called Rob,and then hit the books. I'm studying my ass off because I've got a job interview tomorrow that looks MAJORLY promising (FINALLY TASHA!!!) and I dont want to look like an ass. The guy the seems REALLY interested so I'm excited. This better work out! I've been drinking coffee to stay awake so I can study lots. So I am going to get back to the books. Wish me luck tomorrow!!!"

Friday night Rob slept over. Then Sat. he had work so I got up and made him breakfast and all, then I had to clean and whatever.. that was fun haha. I had to stay home for a while sat. with my grandparents and then finally later on I got to get out of the house. We went to Rob's where his neighbor was setting off fireworks, it was awesome. I slept over Rob's house sat. night. He had work in the morning, when I got up I helped his mom cook stuff for the picnic. Barb and Bill got there around 2 I think and we chilled around. His grandmother got there a little later because she wasnt feeling well. Rob got home from work and we started eating. We had loooots of food. Shrimp, king crab, steak, burgers, hotdogs, tortellini (sp?) salad. Yum. I ate way too much. After eating lots of food and dessert, his grandma had to go to the hospital. We found out after lots of waiting that she had a mini stroke following one she had years ago that she didnt know about. So shes OK now, so I'm happy. It was def. a scare. So Rob slept over again sunday night and we went to the gym in the morning and then went swimming. Monday night we went to Rob's and went out with Alex and Rachel. We just drove around, went to McDonalds, got Starbucks, went to tower. Then we went to blockbuster but didnt get a movie because no one agreed on anything. I slept over Rob's Monday night and we got up and had breakfast and coffee, and then went to the gym again. My parents came home a day early, but whatever. I just stayed in my room anways. Watched all of my shows Tue. night =) Yay for SATC. So Wed. I did laundry and cleaned my room and all, and then Rob came over a little later and we went back to his house to have dinner with his parents. Then we hung out with his friend Sean who is visiting from Seattle. Rob took me home and I watched my shows and went to sleep. Woke up this morning, I slept ok last night but I'm soooo tired still. 
This weekend, I'm sleeping over Rob's Friday night because his aunt's wedding is on Sat.  We might go to the movies Fri. night with Sean and Alex. Yay! So I'm going to the wedding in my pretty new dress that my momma bought me and then after we're going to rob's (Rachel's brother) graduation party. Then who knows. Sunday I am going to my brother's engagement party, that should be fun!!
And yea, so thats it. Busy busy. I have to go give my puppy a bath. Mwa!"

Saturday we hung out and I slept over Rob's with Alex and her friend Alex. It was fun, we stayed up late and had a girlie time. Rob woke me up to say goodbye in the morning before he went to work. I fell back asleep until about 1030 and then got up and hung out with his mom for a bit and watched tv. Had a few cups of coffee and breakfast. Alex and I pretty much just sat out in the sun all day, went swimming, just hung around. Then Rob came home from work and we washed his car, that was fun. My back got burned!! I NEVER burn. wtf!? It doesnt hurt its just hot. So we had dinner and what not. It was a fun day. Now I'm painting my toe nails and watching TV. I have my hot date tonight at 10 with my TV and I couldnt be more excited.

"event","My good days always have to end up with bullshit nights. I'm sick of it. So this morning I was home and did all of the laundry, cleaned my room, changed my sheets, gave my puppy a bath and brushed her, ect. Then Rob and Kenny came to pick me up. We went to another place where I applied for a job cause OMG they were actually hiring. I think the guy really liked me, he was really nice, he said He'd call me soon about the job. I actually think he was japanese. hehe. While we were there Kenny picked out hair dye and lots of chocolate which I was happy about cause I'm a complete menstrual case right now. Then we went back to Rob's to go swimming and order chinese. It ended up being too cold to swim, so Rob and I jumped in for like a min. and that was it. We ate our chinese food and then went to Dunkin Donuts to buy coffee where these three sketchy guys in pick ups were checking out me and Alex. Thank god Rob was inside cause he woulda flipped a shit. He's very protective over us.  Uh oh, Bond commercial. hahah. Oh, kii, how I miss you. Ok ok. So then we went back to Rob's where Alex clothed me cause it was cold and all I had was a halter and a mini skirt. haha. So she gave me pants and a sweatshirt  and we went to Cove to walk around and chill. We sat up on the rocks and just talked, it was amazing, it's a beautiful night. We through pennies into the ocean and made wishes haha, we're dorks. Then we walked back to the car so he could bring me home. So i walk in, and my mother is passed out on the couch in her clothes with no blankets, TV and lights on, the whole bit. So Rob left cause Kenny and Alex were waiting in the car, and I tried talking to my mother, she woke up for about 5 sec. I asked her how much she had to drink and she told me two glasses of wine. Then she just passed back out. So I went into the kitchen, and the huge like, gallon of wine that she bought yesterday was half empty. WTF!?!?! she drank HALF the bottle of wine in one night!??! So apparently if Kari isnt home its a HUGE party to get plastered. I'm pissed. I can't come home after having a good day ONE NIGHT without her being plastered, I'm so tiiiiired of this. I need my own place, asap. As soon as I get my car, thats the next step. So thats my wonderful day, and what I get to come home to. FUN! I'm done venting, bye."

I got ready and we went to his house to take pics of him and alex for graduation. They left and I hung out at the house for a bit and then left with his parents to pick up his grandmother. We got to graduation early and got good seats in the shade, it was a beautiful day. I sat with his parents, grandma, Barb and Bill. Graduation was alright, some boring speaches and what not. Rob and Kenny wore just their boxers under their gowns. It was.. interesting. We found each other afterward, took more pictures, and then went back to the house. Hung out a bit, ate lots of good food and cake. Then we went over Rachel's to hang out with people. We drove around and played a joke on this kid, we tied him up and dumped him in the trunk. haha. After we got home we went to robs to pick up clothes and went back to Rachel's to sleep over. Rob and I make a nice bed on the floor with about 8 blankets, it was comfy. Alex brought up an issue that was totally out of the blue. She said that Rob and I should save to get a place together. I was like, whoa. I guess Rob thought it was a good idea, and I wouldnt mind at all, so I guess we'll see what happens. Two of Rachel's friends came over around 2, so we just hung around outside for a bit, had a smoke and went to bed late feeling like crap. We woke up around 11, had a cig, bummed around. I love waking up next to my love. I think I fell back asleep a few times. We left around 1:15, and now I'm home, very tired with a tummy ache and bad PMS. haha. Its gross out so I'm just gonna hang around and be lazy for a while. I have my hot date tonight at 10 with my tv. Yay! I'm excited."

Friday night Rob and I hung out with Matt and Ashley and just drove around in Matt's hooked up car. Saturday Rob and I went out to dinner with his parent's, and that was awesome. I love them. Then after dinner we went to the movies with Vanessa to see the new Harry Potter movie. Sunday I went to my grandparent's with Rob, my mother and Kirk. This weekend was just as fun and entertaining.  Friday night I got to see my love and we had fun, we went to his house and went swimming and got pizza and then went to Rachel's for a bit. Saturday Heidi came!! We went to the city alll day. We walked around china town, went shopping a bit, and then ate in little Italy and had the BEST food ever. Then we had dessert, hopped in a cab and went to Irving Plaza for the Richard Thompson concert. It was AMAZING. We were def. the youngest people there. This man is so amazing..  and I must say, for an older man, he had the sexiest voice. We left a little early, walked around a bit, got a hot dog, a cig, and then got on the train to come home. We got lost in the parking garage and it was fun. Got home a bit before 2. It was an awesome day. This morning I had to get up early to wake up Heidi and get ready for my cousin's baptism. He was far too cute. He ran around through mostly the whole thing. Then we went back to my aunt's and ate a lot of really good food and just hung around a bit. Aleksandre was our entertainment and he was absolutely adorable. He's got he cutest little face, smile, laugh, and the best personality ever. He's way too intelligent for his age. haha. So after a while we came home and here I am. Now I'm just relaxing cause I'm exhausted and in a bit I'm going over Rob's for a while cause I haven't seen him all weekend. I'm excited! hehe. So I'm going to go relax for a while and have some coffee. Yay for really fun, eventful weekends."

I'm swollen with emotion.  
So I'm just going to shut you out, and move on living day by day, so that I may be reborn to situations such as these. 
I'm so in love, it hurts. So in love that I'm scared to death. Everything I love about you baby, I hate it too. It's hard to explain, but you'll have to understand. Just know that I love you so so much.

it doesn't mean much
it doesn't mean anything at all
the life I've left behind me
is a cold room
I've crossed the last line
from where I can't return
where every step I took in faith
betrayed me
and led me from my home
and sweet
sweet surrender
is all that I have to give
you take me in
no questions asked
you strip away the ugliness
that surrounds me
are you an angel
am I already that gone
I only hope
that I won't disappoint you
when I'm down here
on my knees
and sweet surrender
is all that I have to give
sweet surrender
is all that I have to give
and I don't understand
by the touch of your hand
I would be the one to fall
I miss the little things
I miss everything (about you)
it doesn't mean much
it doesn't mean anything at all
the life I left behind me
is a cold room
and sweet surrender
is all that I have to give

"event","What a boring day. I love the snow, but I'm sure I'd love it a lot more if I lived somewhere where I could just go and walk around somewhere. I'd enjoy that. I think it's stopped by now, but whatever. I painted my nails red.. for a bit of change.. kinda like it..I never wear nail polish.. I'm def. turning into more of a girl..I wore lipstick the other day, whats That about?  So I pretty much just sat around all day.. helped out the mom a bit. Talked to Jenn for a while.. I miss her so much. I cant waaaiiitt until she comes home. Clare is home but I havent seen her yet because of le' snow. So I think I've got most of my christmas shopping done, I may have two or three people left to buy for. I'm such a lazy ass, I couldve started wrapping everything today.. but everything is still just sitting there haha.
So I worked all week, same old sh*t.. but Mike came into my work one day so I got to take a break and talk to him for a bit. It was cool. Then Thursday night after a long exhausting day at work I went with Kirk and Holly to the city to help Holly bring all of her stuff to school for her project. We drove in, cause there were like 4 huge bins of stuff and other bags.. lol I dont know how we did it.. but it all got there, we only had to park like a block and a half away.. not too bad. So after that, we had some late dinner at the VegCity diner.. gotta love that place. I got a pizza bagel, because when I'm pmsing all I want in life is some pizza (I know you wanted to know).  So, have you heard? There are these new birth control pills..they allow you to get your period for only like four times out of the year. How awesome is that? But I've also heard that, the first day of those four times.. you just have to stay home cause u feel so shitty. haha. thats a price to pay. 
I really have a craving for Rhonda's pasta salad... I might make some, its not as good, but itll do. I dont mind the whole cooking thing, that doesnt bother me.. I just dont like cleaning up and doing dishes.  Well maybe I'm just lazy, but at least I can admit it.
I dont understand how animals can sleep in the most awkward positions and still be comfortable. My puppy is like Twisted on my bed right now, but she's knocked out. I wish I could sleep like that.. Anyways I think I'm just babbling so I'll go haha. I might make some pasta salad and just laze around and read my cosmo again.. mmmmmmm"

I guess thats a good thing.. was lazy for a while.. took all my pills, had a little breakfast, took a quick shower.. watched the end of a weird movie.. and then my love came over around 1. He was here all day it was awesome because we cant see each other that often anymore cause we're both so busy. There's def. been tension between us because we dont see each other everyday. Just little petty arguments and what not, but all is good. His band didnt have practice today so he got to come over, and he just left. so I pretty much had a good at least 9 hours with him today =) It was nice to finally have some quality time. We just did our thing, hung out for a while, went to mcdonalds cause I had a desperate craving for some chicken nuggets (dont ask, I havent had them in like 5 years). So we ate, then just laid on the couch cuddling and watching TV for a while and my parents came home from work. Hung out in my room for a while, then went next door to hang out with my brother some. Then back here for a while. It was a sad parting lol, we just held each other real tight and just passionately made out(haha) for about ten minutes, and then  he just left to pick up flyers from Neil's house on his way home for their show next friday. So I'm just waiting for him to call when he gets home, and then I'm goin to sleep because Ive got work at 730. yay!! I love my Rob =)

Went to NJ for Thanksgiving to see my family, and it was nice. Friday I worked with my kiitten and it was wonderful because I love her =). Then Friday night we(kiitten and our moms) had another awesome night with each other, going out to dinner and then back here to chat some. Then saturday my love came over for a bit before he had work, I lounged around a bit, went to visit the kiis at work. And then around 7 we went out to fuji for dinner with James. Then we went to Barnes and Noble to get coffee and Jenn and I read sex books while Clare and James just talked. That was mighty interesting, but anything is fun when you're with the kiitten. So then I came home to pack a quick bag, and Kirk and I went to Holly's to meet up with her and Rob. Rob and I went over his friend's house for a bit, then back to Holly's to go spend the night at Kirk's. It was his last night in his old apartment because he's moving again, so there was nothing there but a clock, toilet paper, and butter he forgot in the fridge haha. So that was fun, and this morning Rob brought me home around 10 so that I could shower and be ready to go out to lunch with Heidi and her Daddy because they were around. Rob just slept while I was in the shower.. not much sleep last night because Kirk's floor isnt very comfy and it was cold. So Tim met up with us for lunch and that was cool, we had a good time. Apparently I'm supposed to be saving myself for Heidi's dad, and I'm on his shit list because I've got a boyfriend and I've been cheating on him. HAHA. So now I'm home and very sleepy, my love is at work.. Holly and Kirk are on their way here soon, but I'm going out with Vanessa for a bit. So I must go get ready now. later kids"

I finally got off the waiting list and I've got an appointment with a new specialist tomorrow, so I'm excited. Maybe HE'LL figure out whats wrong with me. Just hoping.. The worst possibility is out, I think, because it didnt show up in my blood work, so I'm SO relieved. 
So I dont know if its from being sick or what.. but everyday when I get home from work I'm just in such a bad mood. I'm tired and just.. well.. bitchy. 
Havent seen too much of my boyfriend lately, he's busy with his band stuff or working or having to be home.. or something else, or I'm at work or whatever.. I dont know, it just really really sucks having to miss someone so much when you're actually WITH them. It really sucks. I thought we were actually gonna get some alone time tomorrow because he gets out at 1030.. but I guess not, because I've got my doc appt. then, and my mom will be home all day. Maybe we'll just go out somewhere, just the two of us for a bit, cause he's jammin at like 2 or 3. That'd be nice. 
So yesterday my boss made me make my first official ""manager phone call"" type thing. He made me call, actually one of my friends who works there, but she's at school, but she had made a mistake over the weekend, that I had to correct somehow. I was nice about it, not a big deal, so he took the phone and just told her whats up, I guess. 
I cant wait for my kii to come home, I miss her SO much. I just want kii and me time, because I havent seen her in soo long. We will have fun, it's exciting.
So thanksgiving is on thursday, and yay I dont work, but I have to be in the car for a few hours to Jersey to be with my family. The only thing I hate is the car ride, but I'll probably just try to sleep the whole time anyways. I had to tell my mother last night that I wont be home for Christmas Eve, because Rob's family invited me over, and I really want to go. I guess she wasnt THRILLED about it, but we dont do anything Xmas eve anyways.. our stuff happens the next day. So I'm excited about that. I need to start my Christmas shopping asap.. hmm..
Ok, well I'm gonna go be lazy for a while cause I feel like craaapp. Later."

"event","So yay Tasha! an update! Alright, so.. weekends.. last weekend was stressful but awesome. Friday night we all (Kirk,me mum, Holly, Rob and I) went out to Fuji for dinner 'cause it was my birthday saturday. So that was a fun time, and Rob made me go to bed early because my test was the next morning. Raahhh, so I popped my happy pill so I could sleep, he slept with me for a while and when he left I was already passed the f*ck out. So I woke up during the night and he was gone and that made me sad =/, but I went back to sleep. Woke up early, got to my test really early, took it.. I think I did well, but I have to wait up to 60 days to hear the results, which sucks.. rah. But I think I passed anyways. So then after that I stopped at mum's work and then at Griebs to have a smoke with Alan and tell everyone how I thought I did and blah blah. then to home where I was just lazy for a bit, and then Rob came over. hehehehe, yea. so anyways. He gave me the prettiest necklace I loooove it. hehe yay. Then I had to get all dressed up because he was taking me out to Red Barn for my bday. He wore a little(well not little) suit. TOO CUTE. So I got all dressed and ready, and we went. Got off the wrong exit, but was all good, we made it. So we ate, some awesome food, and apparently his dad phoned in a credit card number.. and paid for our dinner. The owner came over to have Rob sign and was like ""happy birthday!"". All I could think was.. ""wow, his parents must really love me"". And they do! hehe YAY. So I had an awesome birthday this year, I had a lot of fun and I love my Rob sooo much =). Sunday we just did the usual and went to see my grandparents which was nice, hadn't seen them in a few weeks. So the week was just regular, worked and what not. Then THIS weekend, was my mother's birthday. So Friday night Kirk, Holly, Holly's mum, Rob and I took my mother out to olive garden(mmmm) for dinner, and we made them sing to her, hehehe. Yummy yummy food. I got her nice presents and we had a good time. So yesterday,(sat) was just crazy. I ended up having to work ALL day, which was a pain because it was the fault of highschoolers (not to offend) that work there.. so I had to be in charge and step up and just do my thing, which I have to do normally. So I ended up leaving after figuring things out, and then had to go BACK because no one knew how to cash out the registers. So I went back to do that, and ended up having to STAY, because everything was screwed up and it got really busy, it being the weekend before thanksgiving and all. So I talked to my boss and he he asked me and alan who showed up to stay. So we did, until we closed to make sure everything was copacetic. So then I had to RUSH home to get ready for 2 seconds, didnt even have time to change out of my work clothes, ran to pick up Korrine, and then run to the show. Can I just say.. that I am so proud of Rob. His band Rocked the entire place, and we got some awesome feedback. So after the show we were going to go to the diner, but we ended up going back to Neil's house for a while to just chill out, and we made a fire in the back yard and just chilled and talked for a while with our little group until I had to bring Korrine home. So yea, I had a good night, after the stressful annoying day. But that day paid off very well. This morning I got a call from my boss wanting to know if I could work Saturdays next month, and I asked why, because I never work weekends. And HE said =)that he wants me there, because he wants to upgrade me to a manager, pay me more, I'm gonna get my own supervisor code, and well, I'll just plain be in charge. With I'm fine with, because its pretty much what I do now. So yays for another raise, and having much authority, because I know how things work at Griebs. I'm very happy, because he said ""well, you can do everything, so I'm not worried about it"", meaning I can work out front, cause I know pretty much everything about that, and I can work in the pharmacy, cause I AM a pharmacy tech. SO yyyaaaayyyy. SO then after that I was very happy, and I hung out for a while and showered. Rob and his sister came to pick me up around 230, and we just went to Neil's house to chill and watch the tape from last night. Then after that we went back to Rob's house, because his mum had invited me over for dinner, so I stayed and had the best time because I love his family and they make me laugh so hard I want to pee. So it was fuuuuun. He dropped me off a while ago and now I'm home. So I'm happy, and I get to work early tomorrow, but its okay....cause I'm a manager! yay!"

Now you've probably heard me say this before,  but dont ruin my happiness, because it's different. He's so perfect for me, it's crazy. I love everything about him, and him for me, apparently.

""And these nights I get high just from breathing.
When I lie here with you, I'm sure that I'm real""

Last week I went with Holly to Newtown to her aunt and uncle's house to get our hair dyed. It was fun, and on the way back.. we noticed that well... the car really didnt have gas. So we were searching for exits on the merit that might have gas stations. We get off one thinking, well theres got to be one here, because there's a college right off this exit. So yea.. no gas stations ANYWHERE. So we're driving, and the car.. runs completely out of gas. she pulls over to the side of the road as much as she can, and we have to go to these old people's house,which wasnt so bad because they were nice and they had gas at the house for the lawn mower. They gave that to us and told us where the nearest gas station was. Thankfully, we got there. I was laughing from the second the car stopped, because well.. we just had no gas! It was funny! A very interesting night. 
My baby had his FIRST show with his band on Friday night. He was SO excited, so we all went to watch, and his whole family was there (they are just TOO cute, I love them). They did an AWESOME job for their first show, they didnt play any covers or anything, all of their own stuff. And they got some awesome feedback from a few guys that were there. So apparently my boyfriend has the fastest fingers one of these kids had ever seen, and made sure to tell him that. He was very happy. I was very proud of him, and hopefully they'll have another show in Nov. around Thanksgiving, so hopefully ya'll will come! I'll let you know details =).
So after the show I had the BEST surprise ever. MY KIITTEN SHOWED UP!!! I havent seen her in SO long, and I just love her so much =). I was expecting it at all because she KEPT it from me!! But thats ok, because I screamed I was so happy and hugged her for about an hour haha. Aw, my kiitten. I love you kii!!! MWA MWA!!
So holly had her halloween party on Sat. night and that was fun. Some of us slept over and I got to sleep with my baby again =) It was nice. Nothing better. So that made me very happy, those few days were just awesome.
So I went to the doc's today ( one of them). and I have a really bad sinus infection! Go figure! So I'm doped up on antibiotics again. I swear I've taken more in the past few weeks than in my entire life. I'm on like two or three other things besides those. And I've got to do some testy- thingys for the next few days, cause she thinks I've got this disease or syndrome she was telling me about, but I really dont remember anything she told me lol!. Oh well. I feel like shit, but I'm happy =) So I'm gonna go and be happy. hehehe"

"event","So yay! haha I'm sick =/ and I feel really gross. But today and tomorrow will be so fun!! I'm about to go in the shower to get ready. Today.. hm.. Rob's coming over eventually, and then Holly-o is picking me up after her meeting with Ruby and then we're goin to get our nails done because mine reaalllly need it, Rob can just sit there, or maybe I'll make him get a manicure hahah. So then we're off to the Olive Garden to celebrate the finishing of Holly's book, FINALLY!! Have to stop at cvs at some point to get a camera cause mine's broken =( and a pack of smokes for the city. Then I'm sleeping over Holly's, maybe Rob too, and Rob's mom is picking us up REALLLLLY early to bring us to the train station. Rob's sister has her audition for broadway, and Holly's goin to class, so Rob and I are just gonna wander around the city and shop until Alex is done, and we'll probably meet up with Holly-o after her class and wander around some more. I'm thinking of getting my industrial tomorrow if I have the cash, and if not, i'm going with my KII to get it done! And I'm hoping that things go as planned and I'm getting my next tattoo with my kii too!!Fun!!!
Yay for a whole day in the city. Yays for shopping. Hopefully I wont feel like shit tomorrow, and that wont get in the way. Maybe we'll go back to vegcity for lunch. I wouldnt mind a soy shake about now.. mmmmm. So after allll this fun on thursday I have work aallll morning and THEN class... I hope I get better soon!! But thats all worth it, because Heidi is coming on Fri night! and we get to go to Bullshead and get my Chicken Especial! hahaha AND THEN! On Sat. I get to go and spend the whole day AND night at Mville!! I get to see everyone! I'm so excited, I miss them all soooo much! Which is good because Rob will be in NH that weekend, so I'll be occupied even though i'll still miss him =/ but YAY!! and TTTHHHEEEENNN haha there's more! My parents are going camping next weekend, and then my father is going fishing for a week, coming back Fri, and then my rents are leaving for a week to go to FL and stay in the condo. So my father will be gone for TWO WHOLE WEEKS! I'm just far too too happy about that!So good times today tomorrow, this weekend, and ahead, yay yay!

Mmmmmm greeeaaatt movie. Goes well with my entry though. If this week works out for me, I will be one of the LUCKIEST 18 year olds I know. So, I've done a lot for my age, I've been a lot of places, seen a lot of things, experienced a LOT. Yet there is still so much on conquer in this far off expanded world. 
This Sunday, will ROCK MY WORLD if it works out as planned. Now, while I was in Japan, I got to meet a Zen Master, eat in one of his temples, even meditate in one of his halls.  But this Sunday, will just put the icing on the cake. This Sunday, my brother and I, are going to see the Dalai Lama. A dream that I've had for so long now, will finally come through. If it doesnt happen I will be extremely disappointed. I have a feeling it will work out though =) I get to see him in person, and listen to his teachings... I am just overly excited. Just another AWESOME experience to add to my list =)

So monday I've got class and what not and I work Tuesday... but Wednesday!!!! Wednesday I might possibly be going to see Dave Matthews, for the first time. I know!! I dont know how its taken me this long to get there, but oh oh, I've made it!!  And then of course Thursday is loaded with class and work, and then work friday. 
Its my grandpa's birthday this Friday so I'm taking work off to go see him =) He's too cute, I love him. So besides the studying, class, and work, this week is honestly, just going to Rock the socks off of my feet (not that I wear socks). 
I get my new computer tomorrow!!!!!!! My brother is building me a completely new and beautiful desk top, because my old one was getting a little rusty, lol. It's all ""sooped up"", if thats EVEN how you spell that haha. I cannot wait, it is going to be woooonderful. It will go well with my new friggin' huge monitor and my new purple keyboard =)!!!

Even between our busy schedules, I've been able to see my boyfriend. It's hard, but we're workin it out and there have only been a few days we havent seen each other. Like today, we didnt think that we would see each other. But then Holly Kirk and I stopped over his house for a bit and his mom was just far too adorable, as usual. I swear, she loves me. haha. She ordered extra pics of him, so that I could get one, and she gave it to me tonight =) Now she's badgering us because she needs pictures of the both of us together. Apparently she's been trying to describe me to everyone and it's just difficult, so she wants a picture to make it easy. I've finally found a place a truly belong. =)
Class is going well, my certification exam is on my birthday!! AAaaahhh!! Well, I'll pass, so you know... Happy Birthday to ME!!!!!!! Rob was a little upset about that because apparently he was planning this WHOLE day for me and he wants to spoil me rotten, but I guess that'll just have to do on another day hehehe.

Everything just feels like it's finally falling into place.  Class is going well, my profession will keep me extremely well off, because Hell.. I will be making some good dough. I'm deeply in love.. ahh, Its so nice. It is a little scary how one person can have so much affect on your emotions. Buts its great, when you know that feeling is actually mutual.I'll be getting my pretty car that I'm in love with. I just feel like.. SO HAPPY. lol sorry, I'm just a BIG BIG dork. =) Not even, I'm just actually content with my life right now.. although I do miss all of my friends who are away at school. Esp. my kiitten. Love you kii! hope you're doing well, I miss you lots! I'll be sure to keep up our tradition and call you while I'm seeing Dave Matthews =)
See Tasha! I didnt have anything to write about earlier today, but HEY! A LOT can happen in one day. My week just went from stressful class related, to AWESOME life changing experience."

"event","So I have come to the conclusion that everyone must go through a terrible, terrible break-up before they find someone who is truly right for them. And I mean terrible as in, you're the one being hurt.. you feel the pain and emptiness and all of that jazz. You must know true pain and regret to find yourself, and what you need. Yes of course, I believe it could happen more than once... but it has got to happen at LEAST once to everyone before finding someone who is truly right for them. I mean, how are you supposed to know the true meaning of love, and be able to appreciate someone with all you've got, if you havent learned of losing it? Because of this, I feel terrible for people that havent experienced their one terrible break-up yet. It will happen to them eventually, when they least expect it (because that's how it always happens). I dont wish this pain upon anyone, but hey, what must happen, must happen. It's for the better in the end, it truly is. It makes for a MUCH stronger person. A lot of my friends, as well as I have been through this. I've seen a much greater appreciation for not only significant others in their lives, but their friends as well, and everyone around them. Once you've lost something so dear to you, you appreciate the things you have so much more. 

So enough of that. It's only about 1245 and I cant sleep... so what else is new aye? 
I've been studying my ass off every chance I get to be prepared for my ass-whooping when I get to class. haha. I should be fine though, Jenn has convinced me that I can handle this, and you know what? I CAN! and I will.   Cleaned my room up a little bit tonight, got some things done. Makes me happy. My mother and I are driving up halfway to meet my sister Sunday because she's coming home for a week or so. I havent seen her since January. So this should be interesting. 
Oh yes, Yay for weddings in March. ""It'll be the biggest cake ever!"" haha yes yes, I love cake.
So someone tell me that they've seen this awesome invention of the cupcake CAKE. It's like a pull apart cake made of CUPCAKES!! It's my dream come true. I dont even have words to express...
haha So I went to the doctor last week, and I've def. lost weight since I've been there last.. I Guess? thats a good thing? haha. Well apparently everything is fine, which is good, because Rob is a paranoid freak who worries about everything =) But I love him none the less.
Wow someone just called my house and let it ring all of once. haha Yay for prank calls, I remember those. Yea, back in third grade with Danielle.. Third grade. 
So I'm out of things to say for now (probably not, I'm just sick of writing =) ).
But I hope Tasha, that this entry was good enough for you since I havent had time to write. And of course to all of my other friends who waste their time reading this thing =)
No better time to be an insomniac than now.

You realize the sun doesn't go down,
it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round.."

"event","So I havent written in a while, and Tasha has told me that my boyfriend takes up too much of my time because I dont write anymore. haha well I'm proving her wrong, so here I am.
It has been an AWESOME past few weeks. Ive just been hanging out with everyone, got to see Cyndi Lauper, up close and personal, mind you. She is such a hot woman, and her voice.. just astounds me every time. Goin places, seeing people, working, spending time with my baby, I've just been very busy. But busy is good, I'm never home anymore and my mother complains, but I've spent a little more time with her lately. This past weekend my parents went away so it was nice, Rob was over pretty much all weekend when we werent working. On Sunday Kirk, Holly, Rob and I went to my grandparents for dinner and we watched Lord of the Rings. My grandparents really like Rob and he loves them too, so it works out =) 
I'm all signed up for my class and I'm excited but scared. Yays for being a pharmacist technician, but no yays for the hard ass class I have to take to get there. Hell, at least I'm going places, right?  So, duh, I'm in love. And this is better than anything I've ever had before, its so REAL, and its amazing because its a mutual love. I actually feel appreciated and loved, I really need that. Its been at LEAST a year since Ive felt anything close to that. He is awesome in every way. So I havent been wearing much makeup lately, which is good, I'm not sure, I think I've just become lazy with it. But its fine, because I'm not lookin' so bad, or at least I think... lol. It always helps to have someone to tell you you're beautiful like everyday.. because I've never had that either.
Hm, so what else is new.. My kiis are back at school and I miss them terribly already. I'm dragging Holly and Nina down to Boston at some point to meet up with Jenn and people to go shake the ass at some clubs. Yays for places 18 and over. I love my Jenn, she honestly is my lifeline and I would be dead without her. Everyone needs a best friend like Jenn, she's always there when I need her. hehe. My best friend since out of the womb. I LOVE YOU KIITTEN! u are perfect in every way =)
So I've got work early so I think I'll go now, even though I'm sure I'll be up for a while longer =) I will try to write soon once I remember things. hehe. Lata!"

"event","We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder,
I'll use my hands
Your body Is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way your hair
falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling
towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder,
I'll use my hands
Your body Is a wonderland

Damn baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder,
I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland


He loves me!!!!!!!! Love makes me feel so dumb =)
Swweeeeet dreams"

Tomorrow will be a week, I'm excited. I work every day this week, all morning shifts. I was sick all night so I didnt go in today. So Raquel came over with taco bell and a movie and we just chilled and talked, and then a little while later Rob came over. So we finished the movie and talked for a bit and then Raquel left and Rob and I just snuggled and hung out for a while until he had to leave, which we were both very sad about. I've got just the sweetest boy.. =D
I talked to Chris last night, and everything is cool, we discussed the whole deal and we are still friends. Talkin to him now again =) Heidi called today and we've already got a whole event planned for a weekend in Sep. near her bday. Its going to be fun, I'm dragging Rob to lucky chengs, and he's gonna have fun whether he likes it or not. lol.

"event","So... today was an awesome day =) Even though I had a terrible day at work, my day started when Rob came over. So Steve showed up at work today to pick up his check, and put me in  a horrible mood. Every time I see him now, I think it gets worse. Oh well, I guess its just best that I just.. dont see him! That way everything will be happy and my moods wont swing at the sight of an obnoxious, beautiful... 'old friend'. Whatever, he wants to act like we never had anything really special, then it'll be that way. It obviously wasnt so special. Anyways, on a happier note, Rob and I just ended up laying in bed and talking for hooouuurs, It was completely awesome. Then we went to the diner for dinner, which was nice. After that, he had other plans, so Holly and Kirk came to pick me up, and we went back to Holly's and watched an Angelina movie, because that's what we do =). It was fun. So now I'm home, and even though I'm tired, I'm far too happy to sleep. I think I may be heading towards something really good. That excites me.. I'm tired of picking around, and I think this may work out well.
Alright, well time to wash up and get some stuff done! Gnite!"

"event","I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak,
And this bottle of beast
Is taking me home

I'm cuddling close
To blankets and sheets
But you're not alone, and you're not discreet
Make sure I know who's taking you home.

I'm reading your note over again
There's not a word that I comprehend,
Except when you signed it
""I will love you always and forever.""

Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs
And sit alone and wonder
How you're making out
But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone
Making out.

I'm missing your laugh
How did it break?
And when did your eyes begin to look fake?
I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.

I'm cuddling close to blankets and sheets
I am alone
In my defeat I wish we knew you were safely at home

I'm missing your bed
I never sleep
Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and
This bottle of beast is taking me home.

Your hair, it's everywhere.
Screaming infidelities
And taking its wear."

"event","WoW! I'm getting good with this update thing.. So I had a really bad day today with the exception of a few things. My body made me happy today, and I got some awesome news at work, which made me really happy. Then I had to go to the office after work, which really sucked, I really hate that man. rawr. Went to Taco Bell with Holly for food right after Grieb's and before the whole office deal. Yea... scary stuff on the way back to the office. Her car stalled on the highway in traffic, and then EVERY time we stopped after we got off the exit. We were freakin' out. So she took Kirk's car to work and left her car at the office, because we're all scared of it now. That was interesting. So I get home, I'm exhausted so I decide to just lounge in my room away from everyone and watch a movie on my computer. That was fine.. until Scott called and my father storms into my room and starts SCREAMING at me while I'm on the phone, threatening to kick me out of the house if I ever burn incense in my room again. WoW, I was SO embarrassed. Who does that? While I'm on the phone with someone!? I felt terrible that he had to hear that. So anyways, that put me in an even worse mood. Kii came to the rescue as always. Went to get some salad at Post Corner with kii, Jaz and Yvonne. Then as always made a trip to Stop and Shop, blasted some music in the parking lot. It was great. Jaz called a radio station and tried requesting a song for Yvonne, but I really dont think they played it.. haha I love those chicks, I really do. When I'm with them, I'm so happy. As bad as shit is at home, I never think about the bad stuff when I'm with them. They can get me out of any bad mood, I love it. I love them! My friends are the best =) 
So now I'm home, just hangin out, still sleepy but definitely in a better mood. 
I keep thinking about him.. this distance thing isnt making it any better.. because it just makes my mind wander even more because I have no idea what to think. I bet that's not healthy. I bought some rice pudding at stop and shop tonight, it made me think of Heidi. That is our comfort food, and we lived off of it at school. I miss her! I havent seen her in a while, I hope she can make it up next weekend for the Potent Minds show. Yea, by the way, you all need to go. lol. It's going to be an awesome show.
August 8th at the Roxy in Norwalk, show starts at 8. I'm excited. Hopefully I'll know if things are a go... or a no go, by then. Either way it'll be nice to see him, always is.
Tomorrow I've got a busy day!! Have to do tons of laundry and clean my room for the first time in like a year haha. Lots to do. Ahh well, maybe if I get most of it, if not all of it done, I'll be ALLOWED out of the house. Talked to Steve for about like.. TWO minutes tonight, yea, about THAT. I don't even understand that boy.. it's all bickering. Flirty bickering. RAHH
Yea... SO!!. I guess time to go.. Write again soon, no worries!"

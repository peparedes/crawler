To whoever is reading this (hopefully someone not in school): Yeah, I stick my finger down my throat... '~'"

"event","Today was pretty unprodutive. Wrote in my Book of Shodows, played some Gunbound (gained about 10 k) then went over to my friend Jared's house to play some Halo 2. Did well, but Jared and his Halo - guruness pwn me again. His cousins were over as well, but they are bad at it so... I won. ^^

That was really it. I finally got the homosexual sexuality on Fable, which happened after I finally flirted with enough guys. Heh. Jared's cousins, even though I see them almost every week, still don't know that I'm gay. Oh well."

"event","Well, I'm done with my book report for today. I'm on page 112, so that's progress. The stupid thing is not even due until March 23rd, but I have to read it anywho and write the report. At least the report I don't have to do until next weekend becuase I forgot to bring home the format. HeHeHe...

I just remembered that the whole school figured out that I like Brian. Stupid people creeping into my personal business. I should have known better then to blab to Scott. Stupid arrogant monkey fucker.

I dun wanna go back to school. I'm to afraid of all of the gay bashers..."

"event","Well I just started my journal, so I hope it works out. I'm a bit optomistic about this Jounal, so we'll see how it all turns out. Basically you're here to peek into my life and spy on me, you fucking stalker. ^^ (that was a joke for the slow). Anywho...

Well, my book report book which I've been slaving over is overdue, so I have to return that soon. I'm not even finished, so I have to finish it in 2 days, and I still have 100 pages left. It doesn't make it much better for the fact that it's small print, but I suppose it isn't too bad. I try not to have to much of a negetive outlook on these things. At least I like to read, hehe.

Even thuogh I have work ahead, I'm unusually happy. Maybe it's because I've been practicing psi, but i'm not sure. I'm just all giddy today. ^^ Glee."

"event","Hello to all of my old ELN peeps out there.....I am going to be riding in the AIDS/LifeCycle next year which is a 7 day bike ride consisting of 585 miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles in support of AIDS/HIV.  I have to fundraise a minimum of $2500 towards this in support of this pandemic, HIV/AIDS.  I was wondering if there was anyone out there who would support me on this event I am going partake on next June.  If so I would appreciate it more than you know.  If you would like to participate yourself, please do so also, the more the merrier.

How could I have Epilepsy and my puppy also have seizures, what a world?  He knows we will take care of him.  To the vet tomorrow....as long as what is causing the seizures isn't serious I will be alright.  

Still job hunting.  I didn't think when I quit ELN a year ago that the job market in CA would be this horrible.  Had an interview today....went well.  I have two on Thursday that should be fine also.  Let's hope.  It is getting hard to live on only Chris' check.  It must be stressful for her.  

Chris and I have been doing a lot of cycling.  We are getting in great shape.  We went on a ride in Foster City on the weekend, a short ride though, only 30K, but it was nice.  It was for lung cancer so a good cause.  We have another ride coming up this weekend also.  We are quite enjoying all the riding we are doing.  Our bikes are wonderful....just a dream.  In less than a year we will make our journey from SF to LA on the AIDS LifeCycle....now that will be a new journey.  

That is the current news....I'm thirsty.

"event","Well.......I am just not sure what to right or think or say right now.  I don't post too often anymore, just too much going on.  School started up again and it is going to be a tough semester.  Three programming classes....VB.NET, Database programming using Oracle8i, and Data Structures using C++....fun fun.  Two other classes also but not as hard as those.  Eh, enough about school.

What is tripping me out now is the Earthlink shit going on.  I think to myself, what would have happened if I didn't quit back in June.  Would I have a job now?  I keep thinking that me quitting back then totally happened for a reason.  Of course it was to go back to school, but I mean for a deeper reason, because this shit was going to go down now.  It was like it was meant to be.  I think about Chris when she quit working at Providian and then a little while after that they laid off everyone there, it is like the exact same thing.  Weird shit.  Also, if she didn't quit Providian to go to House-2-Home and if that company didn't go down the toilet she wouldn't be at the awesome paying job she is at now.  If she stayed at Providian and got laid off with the rest of them she wouldn't be working where she is now getting paid what she is getting paid now.  I think it is strange how things happen.  It all happens for certain reasons or another.  I truly believe that things work out in the end.  I don't know, it is all kinda trippin' me out a bit I guess.  

Anyway, I'll leave some of my thoughts about the whole ELN thing to myself about those people who didn't lose their jobs, that is a total other issue......

"event","So my first day of no finals, no classes, no homework...I love it!  Of course what did I do today??? Laundry, vacuum, all fucking housework.  I haven't posted in a while so I figured I'd catch up here.  This was a super good semester for me.  So far all str8 A's....whoo hoo.  I don't know about one class but I went into the final with a 98% percent so I only needed a D on the final to keep my A, not a difficult task to accomplish, ya know?  I'm sure happy to get a break.  The last couple weeks were kinda stressful.  I had to study for finals and finish up on a couple group presentations.  The last couple nights I totally didn't sleep and that is so unusual for me.  Oh well, it's over.  The news on my end isn't terribly exciting since all I've been doing is going to school.  

We are going to visit Chris' family the second week in Jan.  That should be cool.  Speaking of cool, it will be way cold there, in Utah that is.  We are going to drive.  Save some money ya know.  Should be fun though.  Our 4th anniversary is coming up on Dec. 31..New Years Eve so that is also kinda cool for us.  We don't have anything planned cause Chris has to work the day after I think.  A bummer I say.  Next year though, for our 5th we are gonna do something cool we decided already.  

Oh well...don't want to bore anyone so I'm gonna head off.  Be well, have a great holiday!!!!!"

Chris has class tonight and I am just fucking around on the computer and probably just gonna watch some TV and then go down to Joyce's house.  Maybe do the passing out candy thing.  We have a whole bunch of candy we can pass out but I can't open the door everytime the doorbell rings and hold back the doggies and pass out candy.  I figure if I go down to Joyce's we can both do it.  Anyway, enough of that.  

Yesterday, I went to see a new/different neurologist at Stanford.  He was really good.  He said that I have Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy.  This is the first time that someone was able to specifically diagnose the type of Epilepsy I have and give me details about it.  He also suggested I stop taking Tegretol and start taking a different medication.  He said I should continue taking the Topomax though and stop taking the Diamox completely.  He sent an advise type letter to Dr. Dozier so I suppose I need to talk to Dozier about what this guy Fisher said.  Interesting info though.

School is still going well.  Got through midterms just fine.  It is crazy that we are past the midway point of the semester, it is going by so quickly.  The spring schedule is out already.  Fine with me.  

Well, I'm gonna go fuck around.

Oh well.  So I have to fucking add yet another two classes this semester.  Like I don't have enough already.  Hey, that is why I quit work, it's ok.  It is only a three hour one day a week class, not the end of the world.  Bummer I don't have fridays off the though.  

School is pretty good.  I am enjoying Visual Basic.  Got our first programming assignment yesterday and I finished it yesterday.  It was fun.  I really enjoyed it.  The only class I could care less for really is Access.  UNIX is cool, kinda fun actually.  C++ is well.....C++.  Same old shit really.  My first little quiz is on Wednesday...lets just hope I do well.  I have three homework assignments due next week.  I think I am all ready to turn them in.

I think things are pretty good otherwise.  Chris is working hard.  Poor thing.  I wish she could not work at all and just go to school.  She has classes and works a full time job.  I want to get out of school and get paid a bunch so she doesn't have to work.  I feel bad that she is the money maker.  I'll see what I can do next year.  I'll take care of it for her.

It was hot as a bitch that day, last sunday.  For those of you non country folk, it is the same thing as Day in the Zone.  It was lots of fun but super hot.  We were boiling like fried eggs I tell you.  Good music though.  Travis Tritt was there, Montgomery Gentry and some other people.  I have been hanging out here at home, keeping up on the house.  Doing the laundry, cleaning, watering the plants everyday.  I am also hooked on John Edward, the psychic.  Ya'll should watch him, he is good.  Wow.  I went to buy my school books yesterday.  Expensive.  Very expensive.  I also got a parking pass, two actually, one for Chris and one for myself.  Spent lots of money.  Hmm, what else is up.  Ahh, got my handy dandy Earthlink picnic tickets.  How you say?  I don't work there anymore but I have tickets...it is a secret.  Well, no more news for now.........."

"event","Ok, so on Friday night I went to see Tim McGraw.  Wow, he is so great.  I did start freaking out though getting up there cause shortly past Placerville there was a fire on US50 and they closed the road and turned us all back so I thought there would be no way I could make it up there in time for the concert.  We had to drive back to Placerville and stop at a gas station and ask for alternate directions to South Tahoe.  Luckily this lady gave us good directions and we got back there about a half hour before the concert started.  So lucky.  We changed and jammed over to Harveys, that is where the concert was going on and then my man Tim came out quite a bit later than the concert was supposed to start.  He had two openers.  He only came on stage past 9pm.  Damn I say.  He was worth it.  Seeing Tim McGraw live in action is worth the wait and the trauma or making it up there with the fire and everything.  I love him.  Of course I had cramps from hell also so I was popping IB's the whole time so that added to the fun.  Oy.  Tim made up for it.  Truly though, it was fun.  We were with Abby and Rae, we all stayed in one room with one bed.  It started out with Chris, Rae, and I in the bed and Abs on the floor and then Rae said that Chris was kicking her so Rae went to sleep on the floor with Abby.  Poor Rae, that hella sucked...poor Abby too.  I felt way bad and I know Chris did too.  I swear, all four of us should have just jammed in the damn bed together, would have been more comfy.  Hehe.  Only one night ya know.  Anyway, so sunday we woke up, did the buffet breakfast thing, and then headed back.  I got to take some cool photos which was cool.  I kinda wish I had my big camera but we will do a cool trip again and I will bring it.  By the end up the day I think everyone was ready to be back.  I wasn't tired but tired in a different sense.  Ok, well, that is all for now....take care ya'll."

Besides the fact that she works...something that I don't do.  I do nothing, she works all day.  I can't exactly have her doing the catbox while I watch TV and eat bonbon's...isn't that the line??  I don't eat bonbon's but ya know what I mean?  I don't really watch TV either too much but oh well.  I paid bills this morning.  I actually was happy to do it.  Was just waiting for the paycheck to hit the bank...YEAH!  That is finally done.  Not much else has really been up.  

We picked Erin up at the airport last night, she came back from Utah.  Looks like at the moment they are not going to be moving there like we thought.  Erin was supposed to be getting that job there, it was guaranteed supposedly but she didn't pass a test so didn't get the job so here she is, back in CA, so they are not moving there.  I guess they have a lead on a place just north of Stockton, fairly close to here, by Grant Line Rd., that they are going to look at on Sat., if they can get that then they will move there.  We will see.

Hmm, what else.  Not much. Same old shit.  Ok, I'm gonna get some food.  Bye for now."

It kept me fairly busy and I am very glad that I wasn't working for part of the time so I had plenty time to write my programs.  Either way, I got an <A>.  That is what its all about, spend six weeks taking a four unit class and walk out with a good grade.  Whoo hoo.

Things have been pretty good since last week.  I have mostly been doing school work because I've had three programs in the past two weeks, one of which was the final, plus the final test itself.  Erin left on Thursday morning to go to Utah, she will return in a couple weeks to assist my mother-in-law and nephew since they too need to make their way to Utah, along with all of their belongings.  I, of course, and Chris, will also help them.  Right now it is just the four of us, Chris, Ryan, Jackie, and myself.  Dennis is on the road driving, he doesn't count, he never counts really.

I suppose the only reason that is happening is because I'm not working and I don't have Friday to look forward to, not like I'm complaining.  I'm quite happy to not be working.  Sleeping in everyday and being able to not have to go to bed early every night is quite nice.  Of course, I still get tired pretty early but it is nice to be able to wake up whenever.  

I don't have too much news to report today, or from the last few days.  One week left of school.  Yeah!  I have one program to write before next wednesday.  Then the final.  That will be cool when summer school is over.  

We still have our extended family living with us.  I think it will be strange when they eventually leave.  After having all the excitement here for the last month or so, I don't know how long it has been, when they leave it will be so quiet around here.  No baby, no barking dogs, how weird that will be.  Back to normal I guess.  It is keeping me on my toes though so that is good.

***I feel bad*** I can't make it to a friends wedding that is coming up soon.  Let me back up.  Before the summer started Chris and I knew that it would be amazingly busy.  We had plans on many of the weekends.  We knew that Pride was in June.  The Monarchs were going to start playing and we wanted to go to some games.  We had tix to go to Phantom of the Opera.  There is other shit, I just can't remember now...ohhh, my aunt, uncle, and cousin were coming to visit (to my dads house) from South Africa...and my grandmother from SA too.  Then the summer started....I found out that Tim McGraw would be coming to Tahoe so I HAD to get tix to see him.  I can go on and on....and it all happened at once..so much so that Chris made a little calendar for July and August and typed it all up...she likes making calendars....weird.  Anyhow, so I get this invite to go to a friends wedding and I was so excited that I even got an invite to it.  I look at it and I didn't even think about it and I told Chris that we have to go and she said no prob.  Then I look more closely and I look at the date, and I look at the calendar, and I was like OMG, shit, there is no way we'll be able to make it, we have two things going on that day, one that we have tix to.....so, not only did I leave the invitation laying around and return it past the RSVP day, but I can't evevn make it to the wedding at all and I feel way bad about it.  I always try make it to all my buddies weddings and this one I can't and I feel like an ass.  I am still gonna go and get them a wedding gift and send them a card and stuff but still, it's just not about that.  It is about being there.  I'm sure they don't consider me one of their greatest best most wonderful friends in the world but I've known her for the past couple years or so and, I don't know, I just wish I could have made it.  Anyway, that is about it for my wedding deal."

I have been quite productive around the house and have been doing school work this past week.  Ya know, laundry, cat box, tidying, etc, etc.  Just taking care of shit around the house.  Ah, and don't forget grocery shopping.  I went to school on Mon, Tues, and Wed. night.  Nothing terribly unusual there.  I have a program to write which I have been way procrastinating on.  I will get to it today or in the next couple days.  It is due Wed. so I need to get to it soon.  

The coolest thing was that I went to the Folsom Pro Rodeo on Friday night.  Soooo cool. OMG.  It was tight.  I didn't see any of ya'll there.  No one out there like Rodeo's?? It was fun.  You're missing out.  

Not much else really been happening.  Mostly just hanging out.  Running errands.  I got a new pair of jeans cause I went down one more pants size.  Pretty cool.  Ok, that is about it for me.  I will be back soon, hopefully sooner than I week like this last time.  Take care all."

Some people I happened to run into or they stopped by my desk, others I hadn't told yet, and others I forgot to tell at all.  If you are reading this and I forgot to tell you that I left, my bad, it was a mistake.  Part of the reason was because I will stay in contact really well.  But lets's not talk about that.

Burnt!!  OMG.  Yes.  San Francisco Pride was today.  I am not a believer of sunblock.  I like to get red and toasty.  So does the new tattoo.  I am charred.  Pride was great fun though.  We drove to Walnut Creek and then took BART to the city.  We got there a bit late, after the parade started, but we were able to get a great spot eventually and took loads of photos of the whole parade.  Love those digital cameras.  After the parade, which took hours, we walked through all the booths and all that shit.  There were about a million of those too.  Ya coulda gotten lost in the booths there were so many of them.  We picked up a tshirt...we get one every year.  Chris also got a visor and I replaced my bracelet cause the dogs always chew mine.  Oh, and we got another poster.  That was all we bought.  We ran into some friends of ours right in the beginning of the day which was really cool.  It was way cool to see them.  We had loads of fun this year.  I am way glad that we went.  Chris also ran into this guy from her old job, I knew him too, we talked to him for a while, they did the business card exchange thing so Chris can call him later.  Anyway, what was I saying, oh, I'm glad we went, we had an awesome time.  We talked to some cool people while watching the parade, saw some great people, and had a fun time.

Also, they took the ball out of my mouse so I had to log on to everything without my mouse ball.  What a pain!  They also made a chain out of paperclips, hehe, and hung it across my cube.  Then to make a long story short, Abby drove me to Chevy's and the whole team was there to surprise me.  It was so cool.  I had no idea.  It was way cool cause I had no clue that I was sitting here all by myself at my desk and they had all left and gone to Chevy's.  How crazy is that?  Haha.  So we got there and the whole team was there, including Deb, it was really so neat of them to do all that.  I thought I'd be able to sneak out quietly tomorrow with nothing happening.  I hate goodbyes.  Even though today is not my last day, and it is tomorrow, I had thought that tomorrow would come and go and everyone would go home as they usually do and I just wouldn't come back on Monday.  Guess not.  I hate saying goodbye, I don't want to say goodbye.  So I won't.  I will be back.  I am not going to say bye to anyone here because I will be back to see everyone.  I won't be able to stay away from Earthlink for too long.  Shit, I've been here for three years.  I can't just walk out and never come back.  These people have been part of my life for a long time now.  I will be back to see them frequently.  Also, I will see them on AIM.  So tomorrow I won't be saying goodbye to anyone.  No way.  Uh uh.  Not happening.  Got that str8.  Good.  I appreciate so much everything that they did for me today, it was so sweet of them.  They are all so wonderful.  Great group of people.

Both Chris and I were in need of a new tat.  I mean, major need.  Hers looks awesome.  You have to see it.  Maybe I'll post a shot.  It is amazing.  I'll post photos of both of ours probably when I get around to it.  I have a midterm tomorrow so after all of that is done with I'll do it.

Not much else up.  One more hour or so and then time to go home.  I'll spend that next hour studying for the midterm.  Fun.  I'm fucking freezing.  I should go sit outside in the meantime.  Damn, it is beyond cold in here.  Oh well.  Anyhow.....take care ya'll."

"event","Well, the time is ticking now...........I told Troy the inevitable.  I didn't want to.  I guess it was for numerous reasons.  Makes me kind of sick just thinking about it now.  Actually, I think I don't even want to talk about it now.  Either way, it's done.

Things are going well.  School is going well.  I finished my first programming assignment.  I even did the ""bonus"" assignment, whoo hoo.  Get extra credit for that one.  I think I'm gonna need the extra credit as time goes by so I figured I should do it.  It's cool because this is a 6 week class and one week is already done and today is day two of the second week so I think things should move fairly quickly.  

Things are all right at home.  Chris' family is still with us.  They don't have a place yet.  It's ok having them there actually.  Much, much better than I thought it would be.  I was telling Chris the other day that it is going to be weird when they leave cause it is kinda cool in a weird way having company around all the time.  Obviously that could get old after a while.  It's only been a couple weeks or so.  But ya know what I mean, I like company, and having them there when Chris isn't there is cool for me.  

Well, I'm gonna go have my morning snack....banana.  Oh, and do some email cause Troy is pacing the floor.  We love Troy though.  Late."

I thought being that he is one month old he would be crying much more or you know what I mean, but he has been really good.  Mostly just sleeping and eating and shitting and pissing.  He has been really good, and really cute.  Dennis has been at work most of the time.  Erin has been just hanging at home and doing I don't know what.  So, not so bad actually.  

School is going pretty well too.  He is actually teaching us C++ instead of C it seems which isn't so bad.  Also we aren't compiling using vi, instead we are using Visual C++ which is totally fine with me.  I'm all over that.  Our first assignment is due on Monday, it doesn't seem to be that bad.  We'll see what happens when I actually start doing it.  

Not much else going on.  I better get back to work I guess.  Been slacking today."

I was off work for a couple days recouping and came back yesterday.  My Tegretol levels came back normal so obviously that med is just fine.  My other medication, Topomax, it is not possible to get a level on, so I don't know if it is at the correct level or not.  There was a cancellation at the neurologist so I am going today at 1pm.  Chris is picking me up at noon.  Hopefully I am get things under control.  I don't think I ever will for some reason.  This disorder has been with me since '89 and it is now 2002.  I don't think it is going anywhere.  Oh well.  

Well, nothing else really up.  Gonna go take a web ct course on UHP."

"event","Ya know.....I'm sitting here......7:30am, Thursday morning, so pretty close to Friday.....at work of course, with no email in the queue, listening to country music....I'm streaming....no, I'm not supposed to...I know Eric, I'm not supposed to but oh well.  It's gonna be a hot ass day today..They said it will hit 100...finally it is beginning to feel like summer.  Can't get better than this.  Well, it could I suppose.  If I wasn't actually at work it would be good.  But being at work with nothing to do is second best and getting paid for it.  Troy gave us the option to leave this morning but we would have had to use vacation time.  Oh sure Troy, I'll waste my vac time on a day when there is no mail....nooo problem.  Hahaha, no thanks.

Last night Chris had to do inventory.  She got home about 8:30.  Earlier than I thought so that was pretty good.  I started the evening very lazily.  Sat on the couch watching TV with the doggies.  Kona on one side.  Chaz was actually on my shoulder.  Cute little guy.  Watched Oprah.  Ashley Judd.  Wow.  Grrrr.  A good grrrr.  Started watching the Celtic/Nets game.  Made a grilled cheese sandwich.  The doggies and I ate.  I decided to call Chris around 7pm.  She bitched about the fact that I was sitting on my ass instead of doing anything productive.  We have a whole pile of clothes upstairs in our room that need to be folded up and put in a bag(s) to go and get donated but we don't have any garbage bags...big black garbage bags to put them in.  All we have are little bags and it would take lots of those so that is why we haven't done it yet.  Anyhow, so my ass got up, and went to the grocery store.  I decided to get some groceries we needed along with black garbage bags.  Went upstairs and folded up all those clothes we are donating.  Also went through more clothes of mine that I decided to donated.  At the same time I went through my dresser and cleaned it out cause it was a major disaster.  Nasty mess basically.  It is very neat and nice now.  Not sure how long that will last.  I was so damn hot.  Our bedroom upstairs get so fucking hot.  I had the air on and window open and fan going.  Nothing helped.  I was pouring.  Fuck.  Either way, by the time Chris got home I had just finished.  I didn't get in trouble, hahaa. Yeah.  Not like I would have gotten in trouble but ya know.  So we took a shower, Chris had some dinner, and headed to bed.  Good night.

School is starting soon.  June 10 I think.  Should be pretty busy during that time.  Oh well, not a problem I guess.  Not sure when Fall semester starts.  I'm not nervous about going back full time just a bit nervous about the whole work thing that is inevitable.  July 12 is my 3 year anniversary with Earthlink.  It's been my life for so long it seems.  Three years ya know.  I've been thinking a lot about how it will be without it.  I'm glad I'm going back to school in Fall.  I will be even happier when I'm all done and I can add something more to my bachelors degree.  Anyway, don't want to talk to much about the whole work thing in LJ.  Sorry.  I doubt anyone will read this far but still.

Anyway, that is about it for now.  Take care all."

Basically we were shopping all day.  It was pretty cool.  We got a few cool things.  We went to this store called ""The Container Store"".  It was so tight.  They don't have one of them up here unfortunately.  It was amazing.  http://www.thecontainerstore.com/  You should check it out.  Not sure if the website will do it justice.  I walked in and started walking around was like omg.  Went to a whole bunch of other places too, it was cool.  

Sunday went to my dad.  My aunt and uncle were visiting from Ohio.  My dads sister.  Hadn't seen them in a long time.  My cousins weren't with them.  Bummer.  They brought us a gift from...shit, I forgot the name of the place.  Grr.  Oh well, it was cool.  We had fun.  My dad smoked chicken, we just bs'd and hung out.  Then watched the Kings game on my dads plasma tv. Hehe.  It was fun.  Then my dad had recorded the Monaco Grand Prix so we all watched that.  F1 racing is tight so we watched that to wait and see if Michael Schumacher would win since he is the man.  Great race, lots of crashes.  Hehe.  Got home fairly late.  

Monday - Memorial Day.  Worked.  Make that extra cash.  Day went by pretty fast and it was quiet and slow which is cool.  Always love that.  Went to see ""Enough"" last night.  J.Lo's movie.  Gotta see J.Lo for Chris.  Cool movie.  Man, she kicked is ass in that movie, hahaha.

Now here we are....today.  Work.  Queues are quiet.  Room is quiet.  I am quiet.  I like it."

She had to have a c-section cause it just wasn't gonna happen the regular old way if ya know what I mean and if ya don't....don't worry about it....He was 9 lbs 10 ounces...huge!!!  Was 21.5 inches long....just a big baby.  He is so cute....I will post a photo so you all can see how cute he is.  So now Chris and I have a nephew...hehe.  We spent Thursday and Friday with Erin and Chris's family doing the baby thing....it was really great actually. 

Sunday joyce had invited us to go to the Pacific Rim Festival with her so we went to that for a couple hours.  It was so cold that we didn't stay very long.  

Sunday evening, afternoon actually, Erin got released, so we went back to the Modesto area and welcomed Ryan home.  Hehe.  What a cute kid.  

Last night, we watched the Kings game.  Wow.  So glad they won.  We all know the deal with the food poisoning and all that crap so I don't need to delve into it anymore.  

Ok. Will post a photo later."

They said they raised 1 million dollars.  How insane is that?  I had an awesome time.  It was a lot of fun though.  Seeing all those women in their pink shirts, knowing that they have survived breast cancer, especially the ones that have survived it over 30 years, or even 15 or 20 years.  Crazy.  I had a good time.  Eye opening I must say.  On Sunday we took apart the fish tank.  It took forever.   Took the water out, rocks out, fish out, took the whole damn thing apart.  What a stress that is gone.  I think Chris feels better about that.  It took a while to do that all though, half the day.  After that we just kinda konked out.  Just sat on the damn couched until it was time for bed. Haha.  Watched TV.  Chris did a butt load of laundry actually and we sat outside while the dogs played.  Chris did the Miracle-Gro thing also but otherwise it was mostly a fish tank day.....Well, back to work for me."

Tomorrow we are doing the ""Race for the Cure"".  http://www.raceforthecure.com/ It should be fun.  Have to wake up at the crack of ass though.  We are going to have to leave the house no later than 6:15am.  That's all right though.  

Ahh, Kings won last night.  Boy, we needed that win.  The thing about it was that we won in Dallas and won with them bringing OUR cow bells to Dallas.  That made it so much more enjoyable.  Motherfuckers, they are shits I tell you.  Can't believe they bought cow bells for 100 of their fans to ring around the Kings bench.  Amazing.  The beauty....we won anyway...haha.  Another game tomorrow night...in Dallas.  Hope they bring those cow bells back... ;)

I want to take Chris away......a vacation.  She needs a break and I want to give it to her.  I went to the Heart Castle website today.  I looked into all of their tours.  http://www.hearstcastle.com/tours/index.asp  They look wonderful.  The last time I went to Hearst Castle I was using a 110mm camera..haha, does that tell you how long ago that was?  Hehehe.  Their tours are inexpensive, less than $20, so it looks pretty good.  It is about 300 miles away from Sacramento...not awfully far, a few hours though, so a nice road trip.  That would be a nice weekend trip.  What a really want to do is take her on a nice vacation, a real vacation.  I just need some money and some time off.  

Well, that is about all for now.    TGIF."

I'm sure only I can tell but either way it sucks.  Hopefully tomorrow at the doctor after work I can get some better meds.

I registered for classes yesterday.  Signed up for one summer classes...32A...C.  I am not really looking forward to taking C, honestly.  It is three days a week from 6-945pm.  I think it is going to kick my ass.  Chris is going to have to try really hard to understand that I may have to stay up later than my ""bedtime"" to write programs during this class.  She will understand, it is only for eight weeks.  I have to get through it.  I don't have a choice, it is a prereq for so many other classes.  Shit, if I don't get through this I might as well not even bother for fall.  Also registered for fall.  Signed up for C++, VB, a UNIX OS class, and an Access class.  Only the first two will be difficult.  Two programming class.....crazy fuck.   Oh well.

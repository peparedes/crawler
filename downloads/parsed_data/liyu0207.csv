1 I don`t like the way you talk//u always like to use the unpoliteness words when talking to others.
2 you always say the dirty words.
3 you always wiretap others phone.
4 you always borrow money from others but never   give back.
5 you always wear too ""spice""that look a little frivolous and flighty and strick up the conversation w/th the good looking guys.
6 you r only 13 , you don`t have to the make up
7 you doesn`t like to study , but always spending time on the phone or hang out woth friends.
8 you have no wild ambition careerism to go to a good high school or university
9 you got 6 boyfriend""s"" for once
10 you always against with ur teacher or fight with paernts
the above r such serious problems that papa mama and I am worried about , but when we are trying  to persuade u , you always ignoring us..
I can`t take anymore..you know,I had a bad temper , I really want to help u being a good girl
but that`s really haed..I dunno what`s haooend ti u , Before you went to the #8 grade , you were good in all ways , not only the goodlooking..hopely you can become mature , that you can self goverment yourself.."

Marina was so possessed in it , But all of them are collect style , and they are very very expensive , but she didn`t have enough money ,  so she didn`t buy it . at least , she left the shop withb regret....
************************************************
I got a enlighten from her~~
Since I born till now ,happiness is always surranding me , I can own everything that I want .
For instance , I have so many Barbies , all kinds of , the layest computer and PDA , new games all the books that I want to read , a sweet home , and people who cares about me ,  who love me....etc..the point is I can have it before I ask , but , I never cherish it , in other words , I don`t know this kind of favor is the things that
I have to be grateful . I felt I always let down my parents , even let down God...><
But why they always being so good to me>??I am not the kind of person who is being so good to be loved..I always ask for better live quality or dislike all the things surrounding me , and I always ""blame everyone but oneself"".I though~that`s a regular life style for everyone , nothing have to be thankful...but after seeing the little story happened on my friend , I realized that=>what I extremely easy to obtain is what many people try hard to obtain..I don`t know what`s my desire happiness , but now I understand I really have to be greatful for all the favor that God gave to me and Dad Mom...I love you..=>
Happiness is surrounding me , I have to cherish it , cuz I am not allow to let down the ones who love me morn than I love myself .
Ones desire is know no end . Love will last forever , but substance won`t..I have everything , and more than I expect..hee...
world is so beautiful.."

*************************************************
Last Wednesday~,I went fishing with my family , it`s almost evening , so I didn`t smear any lotion on my body . After boarding on the fishing boat , I start to fishing . then~my sis and mom being so garrulous~so I went to the deck~I decide to ignoring them~but~my mom was trying to get some chance to ""chat"" with me . Finally , the dinner is ready~then~ they go to the meal~thanks God..the ""chatroom"" is over . In order to have a quiet place for relax , i kept doing my fishing work ....on the deck..I got 38 fish ..
after these, I feel so tired , I slept on the deck , when I woke up it`s already 4:00 in the morning , and my skin was scald by the fishing light , that`s really hurt ; especially my face..till now , it`s start to peeling..I look really terrible with this sunburned skin  > < 
now, I am afraid of going outside , my father(doctor)said I would recover in one week~hope he is not comforting me :(
many of my friends come to visit me..but telling the truth , I really don`t want to meet any others with the peeling face..ohh..what a terrible trip.the injury is still exist till now.
In these few days , I didn`t go anywhere.what I am pleased~is the new semester haven`t start..
I look like a chocolate....heh
> < i hate the peeling face..hope I can restore to health soon...bless me."

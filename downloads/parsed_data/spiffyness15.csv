"event","alright last night i had photos done for my senior photos.. (ill post them when i get them back) i hope they turn out well.. i think they will.. you know how sometimes when your getting the photos taken you can feel that they are going to be good.. well.. i want that feeling to dissappear because it always results in badness!! Lol no no i think they are going to turn out fine.. the photographer is a really good one

anyways.. i went to the creation station today.. which is like this place where you have all this recycled stuff.. and you make things out of it.. rather cool.. but i had a major mental block.. very irritating.. i couldnt think of anything creative >.< im really annoyed by that.. but oh well Lol

im listening to aerosmith.. ive been listening to wierd music lately.. normally im sitting here listening to.. well i guess my music choices are always weird.. o.o im bizzare like that.. 

Tomorrow im going to hit the jcpennys sale i think.. for school clothes.. favorite time of the year! shopping is fun.. i dont know why.. it just is..

wow this is a really emotion filled entry.. i just dont really feel like writing right now.. i dont know what the problem is.. i have a lot of things on my mind.. i just.. dont really feel like sharing right now.. so im not.. ill write about it later.. when im in a writing mood.. right now.. im going to get off.. bubye"

"event","i know i know weird combo. I spent the entire day yesterday with melissa and pat which was really great! i love hanging out with them i really do. Pat likes melissa so much and sometimes i just worry that she is going to hurt him.. more then she ever intends to... because i think she is really wanting to stay true to mike (her bf at boot camp). .and i do not think she wants to get involved with pat.. and i think that he is going to get hurt. i dont know what will happen.. life will be funky this year.. but i know im going to have fun.. i can feel it

ive been kind of sad because Ben hasnt called since saturday.. and so i finally got enough courage to call him yesterday and he was washing the car.. and he never called me back.. so i dont know what to think.. maybe it is for the best.. I mean despite ben being a great fantastic person who i adore to the fullest and who makes me really happy to hang out with.. maybe it would be good to just be really good friends with him.. and you know that is all i really go for.. i dont really want to date him very very bad.. i just want him to call because i miss talking to him.. he makes me happy. .because we talk about stupid things that make life seem to disappear.. i love the way that feels.. when you can just talk to someone and for the time you are with them or talking to them.. all your problems.. all the stress in your life.. every that has been weighing on your mind seems to disappear into a dark void for a few minutes and it is just pure true happiness.. you have no troubles at all.. when i talk to Ben i forget my problems and he just lets me talk and talk and he remembers everything i say to him.. and i dont know.. ive never had someone like that.. who truely honestly really listens to what i am saying.. and i dont even need him to be my boyfriend.. i dont even know if that is what i really want from Ben.. all i know is that i want him to be my friend.. a really good friend.. because i think he has the potential to be one of my best.. because we understand eachother. 

I have a photo shoot for my senior photos tonight.. from 7-9pm.. two hours.. 5 outfit changes.. it should be fantastic! when i get them back i will post them.. because hopefully they should be really good.. Simon's were fantastic! i was like *jaw hits floor* 

Simon simon simon.. now talk about someone that i would really like to date. The more i talk to him the more i like him.. but it is a different then ben.. Simon would be less complicated.. because we are in the same youth group etc etc.. and it would just be easier.. but i dont know.. Simon has magnetic eyes.. and i dont even know if they are his eyes in general.. but he has really magnetic eyebrows.. just by moving his eyebrows in a certain way he can look really scary.. but he is one of the most fun, caring, and loving people ever i swear.. he is really nice.. and when he gets really passionate about a topic he gets really intense and his eyes light up and it is just shocking. I love it.. i do not know what im going to do.. i need to stop overthinking everything.. i need to pick a crush and go for it.. rather then all this bouncing back confused stuff.. i mean before california.. before i even met ben.. i was sure i wanted to date simon.. and now im all like confused.. i dont know.. i need to decide everything because then i can see how to proceed..

"event","alright.. i dont know what it is about me.. but i seem to go in spurts.. some weeks i feel all confident and happy the entire week and then others i feel all depressed, sad, and unlucky. Although life seems to be going well and things seem to be doing fine, inside i feel like im falling apart. I think it is because the struggle is back. In 9th grade i had a struggle - the struggle between being the ""good girl"" that everyone saw me as or being the really fat freaky person that no one talked to. Well i am no longer as fat as i was in fact i seem to be shrinking.. so the fat freak really doesnt match.. and for the most part i am living up to thought of being the good girl.. which is fine it really is.. i just sometimes wish that i could be foward to a fault.. 

This times struggle is different.. i think im in the process of becoming the thing that i hate the most.. a sheep.. a sheep person to be exact.. i seem to keep getting trapped into this thing called peer pressure. .and it really freaks me out sometimes.. like.. what if that wouldnt have happened at the exact time it did.. what would i have done? it can get kind of scary sometimes. Growing up is fun because i feel better.. i just get worried about what ill do sometimes.. especially when i get into the moods where im like.. im going to be a senior in high school and i havnt done like anything.. and then my brain starts to race and i ponder talking to some people about having a good time.. it is bad bad bad i know but sometimes it is tempting.. i just need to keep thinking.. <i> will what i am thinking of doing glorify God or will it disrespect him?</i>"

"event","today hasnt been to exciting.. but i have some stuff that happened yesterday..

first: ben is back from california! so that is fantastic. He called me when he got home.. but i was only able to talk to him for an hour before i had to leave. 

second: i got new clothes Lol i got a black sweater which i love and some boot cut jeans which are okay. Feel weird to wear pants because i havnt very much this summer. But i had to get some new clothes for my photo shoot thing on thursday for my senior photo.. when i get them ill probably post em.. Lol the lady is really good! i know because that is where simon got his done and they all came out fantastic! but then again it probably had something to do with the fact that simon is handsome and great in general

third: i went to lunch with pat and then we watched some movies at his house.. we watched.. the shining and final destination II.. alright i liked both movies.. the shining is like his favorite movie.. and i did like it! i mean it isnt the best movie ive ever seen.. but it was pretty good! i went home pretty early though.. Lol i got really tired for some reason.. he is trying to break me.. and the scary part is ill probably let him.

but now onto the exciting events of today.. i had church this morning.. and now im just sittin Lol.. tonight i have church.. where we talk about summer camp and such.. should be pretty.. bad.. i dont like talking in front of the church.. i was thinking about offering to give my testimony of the week.. but the thought of speaking in front of the whole church freaks me out.. i hate talking infront of large groups of people.. hopefully ben will call.. and ill invite him tonight.. and then after the service there is a party for simon.. so that should be exciting.. 

well this has been an exciting non emotional entry.. give me a few days to get comfortable.. and ill post how i really feel"

"event","life is an insane rollercoster.. and i know that my life isnt as exciting as some things may be.. but for some stupid reason it seems nuts to me lately.. ive been thinking about things i would never normally even concider and i know it is because of my friend pat who always mentions something and it liks sticks to my brain like cement. sometimes it is nice, sure, but other times im like ""GET OUT OF MY HEAD YOU STUPID THOUGHT!! YOU ARE A BAD THOUGHT!! STOP STICKING TO MY BRAIN!"" but that never works.. my brain is really stubborn and it doesnt like to be yelled at because it is a stupid retarded brain that only cares about it self.

i want to use this livejournal.. i got it i should use it! although i hate my username with a firey passion and i want it to die.. oh well it isnt going to stop me from using this at all.. i have thought about getting an accound on blurty but oh well i like live journal..

see i have a domain and i have the ability to blog but since people actually read i dont like the idea of posting anything there.. well i did have an online journal before where i didnt hold back in and that turned to crap infront of my eyes.. so im not going to broadcast the link to this at all.. anyways ill write more later when i have more time"

"event","Ok this is my first real entry on this. I have a domain yes that is true.. so why am i not having this journal there? well i do have a journal there i just wanted to make one here too.. i think this one will be more based around my real world life rather then my online life. Which i must say my online life is ten times more interesting then my real life.. mmm did that make any sence? anyway i shall write more a little bit later after i finish tweaking this."

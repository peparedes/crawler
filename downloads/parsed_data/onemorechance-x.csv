"event","i had a really big argument with her today and agreed that we'd never talk again and i bet she gets megan or sophie or crystal to have a go at me. and she sed dont come to the place that ive been goin almost every week for pretty much the whole of my life. I wasnt even planning to go but i might just to piss her off. She listed everybody she knew (or her brother knows) as her best friend just to prove she was more popular than me. And I actually wrote out a list until i realised that im not talkin to her...So Ill post it here natalie romany amber tash shannon chris claudia fiona josh chloe (natalies niece lolol :]) jasmine dan luke danielle jodie anyhoo...Ill c + p what i did today also

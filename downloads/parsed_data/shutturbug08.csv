"event","So yeah, i'm stuck in Randolph til after the evvys.  There's no avoiding it.  The commute sucks, but its worth the good sleeping I guess.  I'm feeling alot better, definitely could be better, but its not too bad.  At least my ""dazed and dizzy feeling"" has subsided, so I can concentrate more on my web shite.  I feel so disconnected from everyone else though. Just wanted to let you all know that I miss you guys, but I'll see you soon!... ish.

Oh well, back to work."

One thing that makes me really happy is that my Dad doesn't have to work all day tomorrow like we originally thought, so we'll actually get to have the family together on thanksgiving after all.  I'm really glad, because I miss that.  And some of my extended family will be here too, which is also happy.  

Random thought, but I thought I'd mention it.  While being here, it made me realize how much I want my own house.  Where I can decorate how I want, furnish how I want, run things how I want, keep things neat and clean (other than my room, the rest of the house would be spotless, that i  can promise).  Doesn't even have to be big, even a little cottage sized place.  Just a place that's mine, where I can do what i want too and stuff.  That would be nice.  Like I said, random thought, but I thought I'd share.

In the meantime, I'm looking forward to more food tomorrow.  Yay!"

Classes started today, and I had just one, my intro to visual arts class.  It seems blah, but I'm hoping it will improve.  I am looking forward to classes tomorrow though, should be awesome.  Got some hours back at the photo lab, and I start again next week.  THAT is also awesome.

So I ended up spending the last three weeks, minus perhaps two or three days with Lauren.  The summer without her was pretty harsh, but I'm so glad she's back.  We did lots the past few weeks.  Spent lots of time with the extended Emerson family, did a little partying, visited Cape Cod, Castle Island, and even Randolph.  I haven't gushed in a while, so I think I will right now...  I love my Lauren, and it felt SOOO good to spend that much time with her.  I left her apartment a little over an hour ago, and as soon as the door shut and I started walking back toward the T, it felt like a little part of me was left behind.  I know I'm gonna see her again tomorrow, but it's just kind of a strange empty feeling.  I started teaching her to cook and she made chicken parm pretty much entirely herself, and I was so proud :-D  Ok, I know this sounds ridiculous, but I enjoyed it.  I love my Lauren.  I love where I am in life, and I like where things seem to be going.

"event","I am tired, and don't exactly want to go to work, but would rather be asleep, seeing that it cooled off DRASTICALLY over night and is extremely comfortable right now. Like, want to pull up a blanket comfortable.  After work though, I'm headed to Randolph until Friday, mainly so I can build the bookcase I want for my room, and so I can take advantage of the pool.

I'm hungry... why didn't we buy bagels yesterday?"

"event","Hehehe, I love thunderstorms.  I think I actually feed off the electrical energy from the storm itself, I always feel so energized during and after one.  I hope it brings some cooler air with it.  The air got pretty oppressive this morning, that should be taken care of somewhat.

Anyway, I promised an update the other day, so here we go.  So Dave Matthews Band played at Fenway this past weekend, and I was working both the Friday and Saturday concerts.  I didn't stay Friday, but Saturday I stayed to watch the show.  Which was awesome, hugely because I was standing right in front of the friggin' stage!  When I went into work that morning, I bumped into a guy that I work with at my other security job, and who I also worked with last year at Gillette.  But after talking with him after a bit he agreed to get me on the field when I was finished with work, technically Fenway employees weren't allowed to be there unless they were actually working, so I found my little connection quite useful.  8-)   So it was pretty friggin awesome.

I'm pretty content with July so far, though I wish it could go by faster.  Mainly because my Lauren is coming up at the end of the month!!!!  I really can't wait, and I think I've got a pretty nice weekend planned for us.  She sent me roses the other day, and they were absolutely gorgeous, which made my heart melt.  She makes my heart melt every day though, merely by existing.

Well, I'm working RemDawg's All-Star party at Fenway tonight, so who knows who I'm going to be meeting there (although this means I miss Rescue Me *sadness*).  But it should be wicked fun.  My sister's birthday is Thursday, so I'm probably going to visit her or something.  I also have a bookcase to build for my room, which should be happening sometime in the near future.  Thursday???  Who knows.  All I know is I want this summer to be over, Lauren to be back, and things to get back into action."

So, not even a week later, I've passed my rigging test, and solo exam, meaning I've successfully earned my solo rating, meaning I can now take out a sailboat and sail solo whenever the hell I want! That, plus I decided yesterday to go ahead get kayak certified, so now I can kayak too! And I did!  Hence today's soreness, but so awesome, I did it again today.  :)   Essentially, I found what I'll be doing for the rest of the summer.

And now I'm so friggin' excited, because I see my Lauren THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW!!!!  Yes, that required all caps.  Oh man, I can't wait!  Fly down wednesday night, won't be back til late sunday.  It's going to be amazing!

"event","Ok, its only been one day, but I'm already sick of this weather.

I worked today, and I figured I'd be able to leave early, considering there was 100% chance of heavy rain all friggin' day long.  Well, that didn't happen, because people kept coming for tours!  And if there are tours, well, we are there.  So basically, what today amounted to, was getting absolutely soaked once every three hours all day.  It was, however, rather amusing, and we had a good time fucking around in the souvenir shop in between soakings.  So, even though I came home freezing my ass off and completely soaked, it was all fun times.  Rest assured, I took a nice long hot shower as soon as I got home.

Backtracking to yesterday... a fantastic day!  I finally returned two books to the BPL that were about three months overdue.  After that I walked over to Tealuxe, where I got some iced tea and continued to walk over to, and along the Charles River.  It was such a gorgeous day and I really envied those who were in boats on the river.  So much so, that when I passed by the boat house, I was very careful as to make note of the website posted on a sign outside the place (more coming on this story later).  Upon returning home, I took care of some stuff I've been meaning to do for awhile, such as splitting our cable line, giving myself more electrical outlets in my room, doing laundry, finding a certain jacket, and setting up my cyanotyping exposure box.  After doing all that (very successfully I may add), I went in search of the website I had found earlier.  After pondering it over for a bit, I decided that I'm going to get a membership to the boathouse and learn to sail!  Tomorrow I'll be going back to inquire further in person, but its gonna happen!  And its so friggin AWESOME!

And of course, at this time next week, I'LL BE BACK WITH MY LAUREN!!!!!!!!!!!   :-D

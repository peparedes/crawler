"event","Wow! What an incredible day that was. Hannah and I had a wonderful day! We saw David Blane in a box suspended in the air, saw Kenneth Branagh's bum and got pestered to give a charity worker guy my phone number. Quite weird really, but brilliant.

The play was incredible. Seeing Kenneth Branagh act live, about five feet away from me was the most amazing experience of my life. I was quite overwhelmed! I nicked one of the prop pills off the stage at the end, it's a trebor mint! Ahhhh, Kenneth, you God of actors, you!"

"event","All this week Red Rose Chain have been working hard on our latest project, Macbeth. And it is going brilliantly! It's gonna be a killer show! We go out into the forest this friday, which I'm looking forward too. I need to be cut off from everything for a week or so, I think it will do me good. 

We've got three more days of rehearsing in the studio, two days off, during which I recieve my A-Level results! Oops. Then we're out on friday evening. And boy, am I excited!

Eugene died again yesterday. As it was foggy in the morning I put my lights on, and in true Bekkie style forgot to turn them off! Battery dead, cast of Macbeth pushing poor Eugene up and down a road to try and jump start him, in vain of course! Had to go visit a bloke in a mini garage in the end, but he saved the day! Yay, for Phoenix man! Anyway, yesterday evening was lovely because we went to Jo, David and Jimmy's for a huge FEAST to celebrate Jimmy's birthday. It was just lovely, we had a sing-song and a laugh and gorgeous food. What more could you ask for!?!

It's been outrageously hot at the moment, and today was no exception. It was so hot I didn't know what to do with myself. After returning from Ipswich in a melted car and then going to work for an hour, I decided it would be unbearable to sit outside. So I put on my bikini and sarong, got out a few ice lollies, put on the fan and sat watching ""That Thing You Do"" on a sun lounger in my living room. Most relaxing and pleasant."

"event","Last Friday Kathryn, Katie and I decided to take a trip to Lowestoft. We should have seen the signs as soon as we stepped out of the front door as it was raining. Oh well, nothing was going to spoil our day! So off we went. Trip up there was fine, shouting at every car that overtook us and going rejoicing in every mini we saw! It was raining quite badly, though, and was so dull I had to put my lights on. Once in Lowestoft, driving up towards the pier my windscreen wipers stopped, nice!

We had a good laugh in Lowestoft. Took a little walk and ate fish and chips, which was lovely. We went back to the car early, we had to leave by 1:30 to Katie back for 3pm, and decided to sit and listen to music for a while. However when I turned the ignition the radio did not come on. Actually the whole car would not start. Weird, I thought. It was then I realised I hadn't actually turned my lights off! Shit! Eugene's battery was completely dead! Don't panic, Katie's brother will have the answer-put the car in 2nd, turn the ignition on and push the car. When it gets some speed lift your foot up off the clutch. Sounds simple enough. Not for three giggling girls who haven't got the foggiest of what their doing! After a couple of attempts on our own I went in search of someone with a car who knew how to use Jump leads. Found a guy with a car and VERY nice looking chef to help us out. Jump leads didn't work! But there was an added problem- after searching for the battery under the bonnet and discovering it was in the boot, the bonnet would not shut...AGAIN!! The only thing I remember doing was giggling and repeatedly saying ""I've only been driving a week!!"" However, we sorted the bonnet out and eventually got my dear Eugene started with the help of our very skillfull and beautiful Hotstuff, as he was now named!

Back on the road again, approaching a roundabout. Oops, there goes the bonnet. Yes, the bonnet flies up and hits the windscreen, but does not go back down again! We could not see a thing. And what did we do? Scream, of course! Katie cunningly put on the hazard lights while Kath was screaming at me to turn left. Once safely off the road we started hysterically laughing again, of course! Once I had securely tied the bonnet down and Katie had stopped running around the car trying to escape from a wasp which then stung Kathryn, we were off again!

However, Eugene had decided he had had enough. He was driving really sluggishly, not going above 40 mph. It was only here that I thought that maybe we wouldn't get home. The trip back wasn't as exciting as the one there. No music, lights or anything electrical as it could drain the battery and travelling very slowly with loads of other bastard drivers! 

But we did get home safely and the three of us will all look back on the day in laughter. It was hysterical. I hope this doesn't put anyone off taking a ride in Eugene...he's normally very reliable."

Of course, I wore most unsuitable shoes and ended up dancing barefoot again! My feet hurt this morning! Spice and I were electric guitaring to 80's music all night long!! It was a laugh."

"event","Wednesday was cinema day. Saw 'Bruce Almighty', hilarious!

Then it was 'Body and Soul' mania. It was quite trying on the Thursday and I got quite annoyed with Al. It ended in us having an argument and me feeling a bit shit before our first performance. Luckily, we apologised and were doing stupid things and had a giggle before we went on so I felt better, and now me and Al have a better friendship now too. So, it was for the best really, coz I know I can just tell him when he's annoying me!

The play itself went BRILLIANTLY! Everyone loved it and it went down a treat. We had discussions in between each act and taught the Cha-Cha to people in the interval so my 'public speaking' skills were challenged! Which was great! The show also brought the core chainers group,including directors, closer together. We all put a lot of work in and they appreciated that, although none of us put as much work in as Kirsty did! She was so good! Everyone loved her, and rightly so.

After a very successful day of a workshop with the Derbyshire guys in the morning and a matinee and evening performance we went out for a pizza, on the saturday. Which was lovely. We had a good laugh and I did my Kris Skellorn impression in the middle of the restaurant!! Hilarious!

I then jumped in a taxi and sped off to work in the bar for the Summer Ball! After finishing work at 4 in the morning I then drank with chefs and Kay 'til 7 in the morning. Not the best move seeing as I had to work from 12:30 noon til 8:30 that day! Yeeshk! It wasn't that bad though, coz Kay dragged out a camp bed from somewhere so I slept for a while at work and I got a lot of help with cleaning from Pete, Kay and Luke, bless them!

Now waiting for Kay to appear so we can go and shop for our dresses for Fozzy's leaving due in a couple of weeks. Should be a laugh. Got a workshop tomorrow and I have to leave at 6 in the morning, but Hannah's going too so that should be good. We've got our 'Valentine's Day' premiere in London on Sunday. I can't wait! I hope James is there!! ;)"

"event","Had an interesting day today. Firstly, was on the radio! Was trying to promote ""Body and Soul"" with Jimmy. I spent the whole interview nodding my head, wasn't 'til after I realised nobody would've actually noticed I was there! 

I then spent the morning in Ipswich. Bought a couple of books and DVD's. Then went to Costa. I thought I'd drink my hot chocolate in the corner of the coffee house and read my book, trying to go for the mysterious stranger look. I ended up looking more like the idiot in the corner when I dipped my book in the hot chocolate cream and spent the whole time swatting two mating flies that insisted on joining me!

At home I did housework. Have decided that the best way to keep the parents off my back this year is just to do a little bit of housework whenever possible. It is harder than it looks though. I was battling with a pair of jeans for a good minute to try and get them on the line to dry. Tsk!

Poured my first pint tonight. Feel very proud and grown up! Going to the cinema with Katie and perhaps Kathryn tomorrow. Should be fun. And then it's ""Body and Soul"" all the way, baby! Oooh, exciting!"

"event","'Twas my eighteenth birthday on Friday. It was quite strange... I recieved a digital camera which was excellent! The complete works of Shakespeare and the 4th Harry Potter book with bookends from Hannah, Kirsty, Caroline and Fizz, Glockenspiel and Spanish book from Kate, a wonderful selection of gifts from Kathryn including a triple CD set of the greatest pop icons, a sun visor and a Terry's chocolate bar-she knows me so well, I got a lot of strange things from Paul and a bottle of Champagne from Kay. Not bad really, oh and money.

I spent my birthday decorating my trainers for the prom and then getting ready for the prom. We went in a limo which was fun and the event in itself was quite good. Not fantastic but OK. I received the award for person  most likely to get to Hollywood, beating Liz Craig and Matthew Bendall, and I got a birthday cake. Me and Kathryn danced for the entire evening and then we got on the coach home. It was enjoyable.

I went to Jokers last night to celebrate with the work lot, more enjoyable really. I felt more comfortable in what I was wearing for one and basically had a laugh! Hurrah! Anyway, it was a good birthday.

I finished the 5th Harry Potter book. I finished it on wednesday. I stayed up 'til 3am to finish it. It was a very upsetting. I cried, sad yes, but I do get a bit too involved in my books!! Especially Harry Potter. Anyway, the person who dies in it is one of my favourite characters, so I was most upset and J.K. Rowling is on my most hated persons list at the moment. But at the same time on my Best persons list as she should be congratulated on a most wonderful book!!

Had a water fight at the Sergeants mess kitchens today. Hilarious!"

"event","After reading Hannah Mae's amusing entry on the exam event on Friday I thought I'd write what happened to me. Unfortunately, mine will not be so entertaining! Oh well...

The grueling 5 hour examination session was torture. 3 hours keeping still and silent was all too much for me, and as for answering the question, well, a lost cause really! While Hannah Mae, Gary C, Char-char Binks, Samuel L Jackson, Emma Scoweps, SJR ""crusty-bum"" and myself were battling their way through First World War Literature, Bean Face was Da-doi-ing his way through the Performance Studies exam, which we were yet to face. I looked over at him at one point and he was conducting an imaginary band with his pen, obviously one of his favourite day dreams in which he is actually worth something. Anywho, after the three hours the P.S class, minus Heinz, were put in isolation. Sounds scary but wasn't that strict really seeing as Char, Sam, Hannah and myself went for a walk around to school to the toilets before we went into the room! Haa-haa! We beat the system.

It was rather nice that the 8 of us were put in isolation as we realised it would be the last time we would all be together, without Matt, the way we like it. We passed the time by bitching about the incredible bean, our favourite past time, and pretty much giggling our heads off in true performance studies style, with many impressions of McCrae and Payne. Our last meeting was truly special.

P.S exam was nothing special. Only I really remember about that exam was Mr Phillips. As the invigilator of the exam he had to write on the board when the Physics was to end. It took him a good five minutes to work out that it would be 4:14 from an hour and a half exam that started at 2:44! Bless.

Harry Potter arrived yesterday. No, not the real HP but the new book! Hurrah! Very happy. So will be off to read about his new adventures. It's very thrilling already. Congrats J.K!"

"event","Once upon a time there lived a girl in a desert place. She lived in a tiny cottage with her 100 siblings and farm animals. This girl, we'll call her...Eikkeb (She's jewish), was frightened. She was frightened of many things. She was soon to be tested on her knowledge of certain texts; poems, plays and novels, and Eikkeb knew nothing. Not only did she have that to worry about but she had just been tested on her acting skills and, although the performance went well for her and her fellow actors, she felt that the interview with the examiner beforehand was sabotaged by a German muppet, shaped like a bean, out to ruin everyone's life for them. This Bean, we'll call him Heinz, was a very selfish young actor and only thought of one person...Beanie McBean-Face (himself). Now Eikkeb was worried that he had ruined it for everyone as he babbled about a load of shit and made it sound like we...I mean they, had just sat around for ages and not done any impro work, for fuck's sake! Which admittedly was true-but you don't tell the examiner that! Eikkeb just wanted to be set free and to be let alone to work with her theatre company that was so dear to her, we'll call it... Violet Tulip Rope. However,  the dark lord of education (whoever that may be) was forcing her to take her exams. So, Eikkeb was left pondering over what to do about her examinations. Other things bothered her...the fact that it was her brothers birthday, we'll call him...Luke, was on saturday and she did not know when she was able to get him a present, the fact that she knew it would be years before she would drive, the fact that the prom was approaching ever so quickly and she didn't know what to do about the limo situation' Big Brother was about to come on any minute and she hadn't finished her telegram to her friends and whenever she thought of Sarah-Jayne ""crusty Arse"" Read and Arran ""I'm not ginger but now I am, however I am not gay but am really"" Lynne together she wishes to throw up like a bitch. Anyway, the moral of the story is never trust anyone who looks like a bean coz they'll only betray you.
Love you all.

So in years to come, Bekkie, when your saying ""Why, Oh Why didn't I pass my A Levels?"", it's becasue your too damn lazy! My exam yesterday was...interesting. I have no idea whatsoever how it went, the question was quite hard. Oh well! As B*Witched would say ""C'est La Vie""!

On a lighter note I'm in ""Body And Soul"". Hurrah! Joyous days! I get to dance and act in it so it's fabulous! Feel quite bad for moaning about not being in it really, bit diva-ish. Mariah Carey come on down! Anyway, all seems well on the Red Rose Chain front, hopefully it will all go well. Laa laa. 

I've got that thing where your dreading the next day so much that you decide you just won't go to bed to postpone it. Procrastination again! It's not like I've got an exam tomorrow, just got to do more work on our Drama piece for the exam which is next tuesday *SCREAM* and we have to show it to Mrs ""Blow that horn"" Payne and Mrs ""Excuse me"" McCrae. Nightmare made in hell with Mariah Carey singing and Rik Waller forcing me to eat cabbage covered in mustard.

I've been revising Othello all day, but Blake is a bit iffy so must go over that next, but I don't wanna go to bed late coz I'm already tired. If I don't do well on the Othello question I'll kick myself. I love that play so I'd better. Maybe I'll put Kenneth in my pocket, he may help me.

Thursday is the day I'm dreading more than anything I've ever been scared of in the world. Sociology Power and Politics paper. Oh dear! No, no, no is my response to that one. Not a nice'n!

My brother, a few of his companions and I walked into town. Most irritating when the bus drove by 10 mins after we'd set off! Hmmm... Went shopping, didn't particularly enjoy it but got some good clothes so am happy.

Then had 'Macbeth' rehearsal. Yes, another play! Hurrah! Got cast today. I am Gentlewoman-tending on Lady Macbeth (I'm making her a bit of a dumbass!) and Lady Macduff! Hurrah! Is a very good part. Have to do Northern accent too so I am most pleased. 

Revising starts tomorrow. Oh dear! Here's where the panicking starts! Especially as it's Sociology. Dear God, give me the F now and let's be done with it!! Oh well, not the end of the world. Should be quite pleasant though, coz Kate and I are revising in Christchurch park, Ipswich. It's supposed to be really warm again tomorrow so it should be nice. Then again we might decide not to work and just eat ice creams and talk. But if that's what'll happen, so be it! I will not force any change!!"

"event","Am slightly worried about losing my job. Here's the story...on Good Friday I went into work but found the kitchen to be shut, therefore could not work. Was slightly annoyed because they could have phoned me to tell me I wasn't needed and I could've planned something else to do. Then On Easter Monday i went in. Again, the kitchen was shut, again I hadn't been informed and again I was quite annoyed. Now on Tuesday, I went to Cambridge with Red Rose Chain to do a workshop with about 40 young people in care, expecting to be back in time to go to work. however, it went on longer than expected and traffic was quite bad, so as sods law would have it, I missed work. Thing is I didn't phone up because I was quite bitter about the last two times of them not telling me not to come in and thought I'd get them back by not telling them I was going in. Now, I hadn't had any phone calls at home asking where I was and still haven't so there's a possibility it was shut again but then again they could be saving everything up to scream at me tomorrow night. I am an IDIOT!!
Oh well, I'm going to do another workshop tonight then going out with Fizz, Hannah and Caz, which will be good fun. I might go and wake Luke up now so I can play on ""The Sims""-v. addictive game!"

"event","Well, I'm a tired bunny! I haven't posted an entry in a while due to being on a film set for a week! Incredible experience!! I knew continuity was gonna be a hard one but I did not expect it to be as important and as involved as it was! I had so much fun and learnt a hell of a lot about filming. The crew we had were amazing too. The clapper loader, James, was brilliant for me. Partly because he helped me a lot throughout the week, partly because he was GINGER (hurrah!) and partly because I fancied him! Gordon and Colin were sweet too. Dickie (sound guy) was quite funny at times but quite annoying too!! The actors were incredible. I can't wait to see the finished product now. It was brilliant being on the crew side, and I definately know I want to be involved in film and theatre whether it's acting or behind the scenes/camera! It was amazing to involved in such a professional film shoot. 
Being ""Miss Continuity"" was sooooo frightening at times though. There was a point where the last 2 or 3 slates relied on whether I knew if a girls jacket was done up or not in the first take. I said it was undone, the director, however, thought it was done up. They checked the monitor and there was complete silence in the room, I could feel everyone watching me. Then I heard a voice say ""It was done up"". I wanted to die! I went so red and was really nervous. Then Dick, Director Of Photography, said to fast forward it a bit. That was when they realised they had just watched the rehearsal and the first take they did, Katie's jacket was undone and had been all through the takes!! Hurrah for me!! That was the worst and best moment of the week rolled into one. When I thought I'd got my job wrong and then found out I was perfectly right in the first place! Phew!
I'm gonna miss all the crew guys, we got pretty close to them all, playing football at lunch times and having a giggle between takes. We'll see them all again at the cast and crew premiere in London Baby!! And I will NOT miss getting up at 5:30 every morning! What a nightmare! 
It was quite weird coming back home. I was half expecting someone to suddenly shout ""Quiet for a take!!"" or ""Continuity? Where are you?!!"". But it will defiantely be an experience I will never forget."

It's weird how last week I was really tired and yet was a fab driver. Today, completely awake and perky but...not so fab a driver. Not that I was shit or anything, just not as flawless as last week. That's the problem with getting something perfect, it can only go downhill!! Oh well, never mind. It's only driving!
""Valentine's Day"" starts tomorrow! Ooooh!
Oh, just remembered another thing. I'm kinda annoyed with a certain person...I wasn't gonna mention their name, but she's not gonna come on here and read this (unless anything about Paul was written on!), so...I'm annoyed with Jenna. Why is it, when it comes to a party, people seem to turn into primary school kids? Jenna came up to me yesterday and said, ""How come I'm not invited to your party?"" How childish! So I told her she was, I just wanted to make sure Kathryn got the night off work first. Just in case too many had the night off. Anyway, she wasn't happy and then complained that she hadn't got an invitation. I ignored her then. Anyway, not worth worrying about!"

"event","Hey All!
  Just a quick note to say that all is well in Australia!  It is awesome here.  So much to see and do: I don't think we could ever see it all!  We are staying in a city called Bendigo, about 2 hrs train from Melbourne.  Placement is going really well, and just flying by.  We are moving into a private apartment Monday, which will be great.  A place all to ourselves!  The language and customs are much different than we expected, but easy to pick up.  Hope everyone's summers are going well!  Email me when you get a chance with updates!

"event","Alright, here's my quick and dirty update, seeing as I have to get up for work in a few short hours:
I'm home in Moncton, at least for the next 2 weeks.  Finishing up an 8 week fieldwork placement in Geriatric Rehab at the Moncton Hospital.  It's been a pretty good placement, and great facilities.  A lot of work though: carrying half my preceptor's caseload and trying to get all these mandatory projects done: craziness.  But I've already gotten a job offer (just one yr too early!) so hopefully things will work out well after I graduate.  After this I am off to Australia for another 8 week placement (will be gone til Sept 2: travelling around and such).  Getting excited, plus nervous: I'll try to update with trip plans before I leave.  Still doesn't seem real at all...almost like I'm planning a trip for someone else.  Hmm what else?  Been down to Halifax a few times since being home (just got back after the weekend down, actually).  Starting to miss school (I'm a freak, I know).  It'll be nice to have everyone back.  I cannot believe that I graduate (again) this year.  Time flys in university too.  We're planning our grad trip now, which is very cool.  I'm not one to argue with tropical weather in February!  Yeah, ok, that's all I can think of right now.  Will try and update before I leave (I really will try, Krista, really!).  
Love y'all

"event","Well, I figured that it was time that I updated, given that it's been awhile since I've given a full update.  School is done, well sorta.  Classroom school is done (woohoo!).  I'm on my fieldwork placement now, which is for school but is really pretty much work.  I'm at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown (PEI) for my six week placement.  The placement is going really great.  I have an amazing preceptor, and I think I have learned more practical knowledge in the first week than I learned in my entire first year!  The patients are so friendly and cooperative.  I'm finding it really rewarding, since we see constant improvement, and we know that it's making such a difference in their lives.  The Island is really quite beautiful.  I'm so busy during the days (have to be up at 530, so that's been taking some getting used to!) that I am so tired at night! I am getting the chance to see a lot of the Island though, and it's helpful that there's another student in the year ahead of me in the same hospital, so we're having the opportunity to discover lots of places around.  Plus Mike is coming up next weekend for the long weekend, so hopefully we'll get down to the Beach, even though it is too cold to get anywhere near the water just yet! 
  After my placement I'm heading back to Halifax to work for the remainder of my summer (all 10 weeks of it :) ).  It'll be nice to be in the city for the summer though.  There's a totally different vibe in the summer (probably because of the lack of students) but it's nice and relaxed.  Just hoping to get some pool time in though! Although with our recent snowfall, it isn't looking too promising!
  Hmm, I think that's about it new on my front.  Now it's someone else's turn to update (ahemm hemm: Dawn?  Jon?)"

"event","Ok, well it's been awhile since I've updated, so I suppose that it's time.  I'm edging up on Final exams in a couple of weeks: I just can't believe that my first year is almost over.  It FLEW by.  Wierd to think that I'll have a 'real' job in only 2 years time.  haha!  This semester has been insanely busy: just go go go.  That's part of the reason why I haven't updated: this is my first weeknight without school work in quite a while: yoohoo!
  We had the OT Ball this past weekend and it was a blast.  It was down at the Westin, which is supposed to be one of the best ballrooms in the city.  We made a whole thing out of it: from getting our hair done to a pre-ball party.  Luckily there were plenty of boyfriends and dates there so Mike didn't feel to out of the loop!
  Had a great birthday a couple weeks ago.  Went to a pubcrawl the night before which made the next morning a bit rough.  But my parents came down for the weekend and it was great to see them.  Went for a massage and then we all went to dinner and did the cake thing and all: a very good day all around.
  What else?  Hmmm...got an email from University of Toronto the other day and they wanted to know if I would be coming next yr.  Of course they won't give me any credit for this year (nice of them :) ) so it's really not a very attractive deal.
  Henry is getting very very fat.  I am almost ashamed that he has gotten so big in such a short amount of time.  I really think that I'm going to have to get the kitty treadmill out soon :).  
  Oh, I got elected to our student council last week.  I seriously didn't think I had a chance, so it came as quite the surprise!  I'm going to be sitting on the Dalhousie Student Union council with this position, which is a little intimidating in a way, but should be a great experience.  
  Well, I think that's all that's new for now.  I'll try to update more frequently, but I'm not making any promises :)"

"event","Alright, following in Will's footsteps, coupled with a desperate attempt to procrastinate, I too will update my journal.
  Things have been really busy with school.  Not necessarily super hard, but definitely busy.  The concepts are very different from those in my undergrad, so it's taken some effort to wrap my head around them, but it's all going very well.  I'm now trying to figure out where to do my summer work placement, which is turning out to be harder than I initially anticipated!
  I'm starting (and finishing!) my final exams this week.  Very hard to get motivated when I've already passed my courses without even writing them, so I've been doing pretty much anything but studying (on the bright side, but room hasn't been this clean in months, and there's lots of baking in the apartment!).
  Last weekend we had a benefit variety show put on by all the Health Professions called For the Health of It.  I was involved with choreography for the Occupational Therapy skit, which was a ball!  It was so nice to be back on stage and doing all that artsy stuff again.  I ended up working with a group of about 50 people, which is more than I have done previously, but it went off without a hitch.  ~sniff~  I was so proud ;).
  Mike and I had the Christmas Ball for Medicine a few weeks ago.  Got a new dress (which is always fun!) and had a great time.  It was nice to get all dolled up and have a formal evening out.  The OT Ball isn't until March, so that will tide me over until then! :)
  I can't believe that it's almost Christmas!  A few of us had a Christmas party the other night, and we could hardly to believe that we've been in school for almost 4 months. It feels longer, but shorter at the same time: does that make sense??  I'll be home in probably a week's time: it'll be nice to just sit back and not have to do work!
  Well, I think that's a general summary of the last month or so of my life.  I know I'm forgetting a bunch of things, but ah well.  I look forward to seeing you all (well, except Jonny: I see him all the time ;) ) over Christmas break!"

"event","I decided to update, not because anything particularly exciting is going on, but because it's been forever since I last made an entry!  All moved into the new apartment in Halifax now.  It's pretty nice, with an amazing view (but alas, no dishwasher).  It's also super close to the University.  I'm not used to this (before I was up on main campus, about 15 mins away), so I find that I'm getting up earlier than I have to, just out of habit (I'm sure it will get broken soon enough).  
  I'm well into my schoolwork now, and really enjoying it so far.  It's nice to be learning something that you can see yourself applying in the near future!  The people in the program are super nice.  We all bonded right away, and it feels like we've been in OT for months and months: not just a couple of weeks!  It's hard to believe that exams start next week though!  
  I'm back at the Y again, and back into yoga.  I really enjoy it, but was pretty sore after the first class back!  It's a nice break from studying though, so I imagine that it'll really come in handy once the exams, etc start up.  Mike is pretty busy with med, but we're managing to see each other quite often, which is surprising to me given his work load.  It's a good thing that I'm in the Health Sciences too though: I'm not sure everyone would appreciate the Anatomy jokes!
  That's about all I have to offer right now, but I will try and update more often (i.e. not couple of months)."

"event","So guys, I'm moving to Toronto.  I was accepted in the Faculty of Medicine at University of Toronto to do my Masters in Occupational Therapy, so I'm going to take it.  Even though it screws up all of the plans that I have made in order to attend Dal, I feel that this program is the best education I can receive,as it's the top school in Canada for what I want to do into.  I kinda applied as a joke, never thinking that I would actually get in!  It's a 2 year program, and at the end I'll have a masters (as opposed to a bachelor after 3 yrs at Dal).  They also told me that I can do my placements in my 2nd year in the Maritimes, so I'll probably do that.  It's a huge adventure, and I am scared of the whole thing, but kind of excited too.  I don't think it's entirely sunk in yet.  I'm looking at moving into a residence downtown.  It used to be a hotel, so I'll have my own bathroom and everything (can't go back to freshman living!).  This way I can have everything (bills, food, etc) taken care of, and I can concentrate on my studies.  I'm going to miss everyone so much, but I figure with the amount of time I have off in breaks and vacations, and the convenience of the flights, I'll probably be home more often than when I was in Halifax.  The University will also allow me to do a lot of research, which is where I want to concentrate once I start practicing: I can't believe that I'm planning 2 years in advance!  So crazy..."

"event","Ok, well, summer's trucking through as normally does, minus the warm temperatures.  I'm counting on a warm October!  I guess my big news this week is that I got a call from the University of Western Ontario.  I was moved off the waitlist and offered admission.  After much consideration, and the occasional freak-out, I've decided to reject the offer.  I would only have a month to prepare for a move to a place I've never been, and I actually think Dal is better as it's program is more alligned with what I want.  Also, I know I'll be happier at Dal.  It's an honour just to be considered, right?
  So that is that.  I'm starting to make plans for next year and getting things set up.  Even though I'm returning to the same school, it feels different: probably because of the new program and new apartment (well, sorta....:) )"

"event","Hey all!  Well, here is my first posting!  I wrote my final exam yesterday in Human Physiology (yay!) so now I actually have some spare time: and I don't know what to do with it!  This past week I've finally gained some direction in my life, and was waitlisted at University of Toronto and UNiversity of Western Ontario, and accepted to the Dalhousie Occpuational Therapy program!  Yay!  I'm really looking to starting the progam and getting out into the profession!  It'll be nice to be back in Halifax with everyone.  It appears that we're all flocking to the Health Professions: first Mike, now Jon, and myself!  Got a great prospect on an excellent apartment, which is also pretty relieving.  It's funny how the puzzle pieces fall into place."

"event","So went for a change today.
My hair is no longer blonde.

It's my natural hair color now light brown... with some small blonde highlights. And I now have side bangs.

But it's crazy how different it looks.. I wish I'd done something about it a long time ago.. my hair was tOo blonde.

Pics to come soon!"

"event","it's so crazy how life can totally change in one day.. or week.. or whatever.

i'm so confused about everything.

it's like i don't know what to do or feel..

i hear things from a lot of people.. but hell, they're just people. and i'm learning i'm gonna decide what i want to believe for myself.

i guess time will tell everything though, right.

it's just hard though. i dunno.

this entry is going nowhere..

today is laundry day and so i'm washing clothes and spending quality time with my capone. which is the most spoiled doggie on earth..

but anyway, gonna go take a nap to escape from reality. which is why i've been drunk for a straight week and have went to sleep at 6 AM because i'm in need for an escape.


When you find yourself falling down
Your hopes in the sky but your heart like grape gum on the
ground
And you try to find yourself
In the abstractions of religion and the cruelty of everyone else
And you wake up to realize 
Your standard of living somehow got stuck on survive

And when you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
When you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love

When you realize your only friend
has never been yourself or anyone who cared in the end
That's when everything fades or falls away
Cause the chains which once held us are only the chains which
we've
made

And when you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
When you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love
Love, love, it's nothing without love

We compromised our pride, sacrifice our health
We must demand more, not from each other, but more from
ourselves

Cause when you're standing in deep water
And you're bailing yourself out with a straw
When you're drowning in deep water
And you wake up making love to a wall
Well it's these little times that help to remind
It's nothing without love
Love, love, it's nothing without love
It's nothing without love"

"event","well, i'm about to finally quit being a lazy bum today and get my lil butt in the shower.. 
and then alex, russell, and i are going to see guess who at the dollar theater. i thought i'd never see that movie but now i finally am. so it should be fun!

yesterday at work, a football player from the patriots came in and i waited on him. i had no idea that he was a NFL football player until my manager pulled me aside and told me.. i was like woah, really? but anyways, i ended up getting a 40 dollar tip from him. woot! he gave me a 100 dollar bill at first but said to get that, i'd have to go on a date with him. and of course, i'm not gonna do that. but i was happy with my 40 dollars from one table. it made my day in tips.

so, i love my new apt. my room is the cutest thing ever. i never have been totally happy with my room at my house in cairo or my old apt. but now i'm satisfied that it's cutest to the max. it's really bright and fun. i dunno. you'd have to see it. and my bathroom is done in butterflies so i'm happy with that as well. and even though allison and i don't see each other too much it seems, we are getting along great unlike most roommates.

so, now the only thing i want is an animal. can't get a dog or cat though. and i really want a cuddly animal so it sucks.

ohh and i really think i'm gonna by the postal service CD. i love them so much. i can listen to that all the time and never get tired of it.

i really miss seeing a lot of you guys on here, so please call me or come see me!

tomorrow - alex and i are laying out by the pool and doing laundry. yay. i've been wanting to lay out for so long. i went and got in the tanning bed today but that just doesn't compare to relaxing in the sun.

gonna go get a shower.

"event","<font color=""blue""><font face=""tahoma""><font size=""4"">Okay so I figured I'd do an update while I had some time.
Work is sooo busy! But still fun and I enjoy it a lot!
Today, we had some drama though because it turns out that one of our bus boys was stealing our tips. Sucks cause there's no telling how much money he stole from everyone but it's good he got caught in the 2nd week of work instead of later on down the road...

So, I was pretty bummed the other day cause I weighed myself and I've gained 9 lbs. since I went to the doctor in October. Haha. But, then my boobs have gotten rather large so.. I guess it all works out. J/k. I was definitely pretty upset about it. But hell, who cares cause my body is changing everyday and I look alright I suppose. 
And I'm happy because I'm working on growing out my hair. You guys all know how short it was. Now, it's to my shoulders and that makes me happy!

Umm.. I gotta get to packing this weekend because I move out next Friday! I'm excited.. it should be fun living with the other Allison. But I dread getting all my crap together. I need to go and get some boxes this weekend.

Oh, and I had a good time at Wild Adventures Saturday. That water park there is fun. But I WILL NOT have kids close together in age. We went with a 2 yr. old and a 5 yr. old and they were so annoying and whinning together. It makes me want to reduce the number of kids I want to have down to one now. But, still they are cute and fun but just don't want to take them home with me.. They are very spoiled though so that could be their problem. I wanted to tear their lil asses up!

I have nothing much to say because my life is pretty much waitressing now. And then spending time with Alex at night.

Speaking of, he needs to hurry up and get off work! I'm ready to see my baby.

Well, I hope everyone is doing well. :)"

I love my job so much. It's hard work but I love all the people who work there and all the people that come in that I wait on have been great.
This summer is gonna be awesome just working and no school.
ohhh and i've actually eaten seafood now.. isn't that a gosh darn miracle!? cause i've never eaten it at all until recently. i've learned that shrimp has to be cooked right to be good... i hate it when it's tough and chewy.. gross.. but crystal river has awesome shrimp.

Tomorrow, I'm going to Wild Adventures with my sister and 2 kids she's babysitting so it should be fun.

Alex and I are doing something tonight and I'm dirty from work (worked from 10-5) so shower time and I'm gonna get cutsey-upd to go out tonight. I bought some new cute clothes and a shirt so I've been wanting to get dressed up all week...

Oh and I got Who's Who award and Outstanding Student Achievment Award at Bainbridge College. Woot :P
(Even though I left there a year ago.) haha

Anyway, hope everyone is doing well."

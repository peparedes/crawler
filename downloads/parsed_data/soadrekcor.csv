"event","i think i have found out what i want to do in life ""when i grow up"" i dont know how steady or reliable the job maybe but i think it would be something i could be good at. either publishing or editing books. sounds like me like something i could do...read for a living i am sure there is more to it than that but i think it may be something i am interesting. now that i have choosen a career i have to start working toward it and what if that work of years in college brings me to nowhere? well i guess that is a gamble i will have to take. i have just lived a life of struggle working paycheck to paycheck and i dont want that anymore. which i know money cant make you happy but it sure makes life easier right? so hopefully this works out. i guess if it gets me no where i am at a point in my life where i am at the bottom anyways and i could always change my major i guess"

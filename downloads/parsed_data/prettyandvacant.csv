"event","I was watching Jay Leno last night. Ralph Fiennes was on, and so was the guy who plays Ray Romano's brother (i think) in Everybody Loves Raymond. God that guy is annoying. He just kept on saying ""RALPH! RALPH!"" at the top of his lungs, to show that he knew how to pronounce it. ok, we know it's RAFE not RALPH, but you don't have to make an idiot of yourself at the same time.... so yeah.

"event","""This year, as well, Variety's U.K. Personality Award, the only award not voted for by the fest's jury, will honor Scottish thesp Ewan McGregor.

Variety's exec editor Steven Gaydos said: ""No major U.K. star has toiled as actively in independent films as Ewan McGregor. It's our great pleasure to honor and celebrate Ewan's career at the BIFA Awards and it is also extremely meaningful for Variety to make a contribution in his name to Ewan's most special charity, Rachel House, Scotland's first children's hospice.""

I love that man. ROCK!

I think SNL season premieres today! I hope! *crosses fingers*

I got my highlights redone. That's about is. Cost me (my mom actually) $120. :)

""No Feelings.... for anybody else, exept for myself, in love with myself, my beautiful self..."" HAHAH yes.

I play Final Fantasy X. I am addicted.

I'm sorry this is about Avril Lavinge, but this just extremely pissed me off. She is so rude and disgusting and does not deserve to be 50 feet near decent people. I'm guessing she's just acting that way to keep up her ""badass punk"" image, but it's not funny or original, just really rude and crass. This not only adds on to my hate of her, but makes me think even less of her as an artist and a person. It might be fake, but still.

To see what I'm talking about, go here:

I was reading about Sid Vicious's last days, the stuff with Nancy and such. It made me sad. I hate it when people do drugs. STOP DOING DRUGS PEOPLE! LIVE, LIVE GODDAMIT.

My mom gave me her metal chain with the little metal padlock on it that I've been eyeing for a while now. It was from her punk 70s era. So it is not an Avril whore punk wannabe-ness, it's from when people were actually punk and not a trend. So yes.

Lol. Someone posted a letter all around my school saying ""Please stop smoking on school property, it's inconsiderate to people who don't want to get lung cancer and just plain disgusting, etc."" All you see is the smokers swarming around it and pointing. Fun times.

Well, nothing left here."

"event","this has totally been my worst week so far. Everything is not going right. First the schedule, which was fixed today, NOW the fucking New York City public transportation is slow as hell and it takes TWO FUCKING hours to get home.

I hate New York. Everyone loves it because of September 11, but it's the shittiest place in the fucking world to live in. They care too much about you going to a good high school, but don't supply you with proper things to work with and study with.  The transportation is horrible. I've lived here all my life. It sucks seriously. It's all cool and stuff when you don't have to live here, you just see the good stuff.

"event","My school is a shit. Today was the first day of actual classes (the first seven days was just a writing ""workshop"") so we just got our schedules. Ionly have TWO free periods the whole week. DIE. And on top of that, they screwed my schedule up. It says I have Lunch at 11, but it also turns out that it says I have Algebra And Geometry 2 at 11. So I went to lunch, because all the ""freshpeople"" (as my school call them, supposedly more PC) have lunch at 11, and I am a freshperson, so it's only logical. So after lunch I go up the four floors I have to walk up to get to the class. They always give us five minutes between classes so we can get there on time. So I show up and go to class. And there are only 10th graders there, and the five ninth graders that went up with me because they have that class also. But there was only five minutes left. So the teacher is like ""why did you go to lunch, etc"", thinking we were sophmores. So I'm like, ""teacher man, our schedule says Lunch A : 11am. So I went to lunch with all the other ninth graders."" And he's like ""umm, this is a class for tenth grade"" So I show him my schedule. And he's like ""uuuhhhh, we have to fix this."" But we can't do any schedule stuff until tomorrow. So he told me just to go to the 10th grade lunch. But I had just come from lunch. SO I had two lunch periods. But that's not what pissed me off. It turns out that one of my only two free periods tommorow is the time of the 10th grade lunch. So I have no free period tomorrow if I go to math and then lunch. I can't do it any other way. SO I lose my only free period left in the entire week. SHIT. GODDAMIT. This pisses me off. I have to talk with the schedule people. Come on, how do you NOT notice that you put a person to have two things at the same exact time?

I like my social studies teacher though. She's cool. She's really young and a semi-hippie protester greenpeace person."

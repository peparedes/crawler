ROCK MUSIC/BLOOD PRESSURE
A study done by a Washington state high school student has demonstrated that listening to rock music increases the blood pressure. Becky Bosch studied 20 people aged 12 to 55. The blood pressure increased an average of 10 percent while listening to rock music. There was a slight increase in blood pressure while listening to Bach. (Current Health 2 10(1)17, September 1983)

oh and this....

EGGS/SEXUAL MATURITY
Dr. J. Szepenwol of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine has shown that hens' eggs contain a substance which stimulates sexual development. Chicks on an egg and wheat bran diet became sexually mature sooner than control chicks maintained on a Purina broiler mash diet. (IV Congres. Fed. International d'Anat., Paris, 1955, p. 213). ""Especially in families of children who are given to sensual habits, eggs should not be used."" (Ministry of Healing, p. 320)"

"event","Just an update in case you thought I'd fallen into the void of the universe again. Well I did actually, although it was a bloody excellent void. I headed off to Northumberland on Saturday and made it in good time and without getting lost or car breaking down. Arrived at Ruby's around lunch time then headed off for a bite to eat in a most exquisite little village....only 2 miles from Hogwarts and not very far from the sea either. Met Jude and Bry, Rubes friends and had a real good laugh with them. Everyone is so down to earth and really nice. Went gothing in Newcastle. Ohhhh A and S' you really got to come with me the next time I head through.... You'll love it!! Rubes is coming this weekend too btw...if anyone is wanting to do anything.... any plans let me know."

When I take a pic of myself it seems clear then you save it and when viewed, I dont show up....just a white blurr. Tried taking pics of the cats and everyting else and its ok. Tried it many times but still same result. Went on a works do fri night - I got told by two different people that I genuinely looked like someone they knew, mannerisms and everything and they wanted me to go over and see for myself.....I didn't, too scaredy cat. Yesterday a friend sent me a pic of her sister and told me when I saw it that it would be like looking in the mirror. I looked and it did. She just looked exactly like me, it was completely weird..... I was just thinking about the doppelganger thing when I was in the bathroom, then the door opened and it was the cat! Scared the life out of me."

"event","Well the weekend went far too quickly, thanks to Armandia and co, forcing me to enjoy myself saturday night....they did force me honest! I had a brilliant time in a Lancaster car park, putting on a show with Sarah for dirty old taxi drivers.....actually I was fastening her corset, but it did look a bit fetishy I suppose from behind, especially in their eyes. After ho-ing and hum-ing as to whether the venue we were off to was a 70's night, we made our grand entrance into the tiniest place on earth with a non existant dance floor to watch the brilliant 'Pro-jekt'.  So the band played on and Sarah and I did our bestest sticky carpet dance until we were hobbled directly in front by some wannabes/bints whom thought it was cool to dance like some retarded yankee 80's bimbos....actually the way they were dancing somewhat reminded me of a Bitterns courtship ritual! Anyhow we made the most of the space and danced our little fishnets off, however Armandia was a little less happy as some t*@ threw an ice-cube which hit her head....t*@s! Hmmm anyhow, later, got chatting to Pro-Jekt whom I met before they went on the euro tour, had a long and down to earth conversation with Al - very pleasant. So I left the venue with Armandia and co and headed off for some late night lunch, then had a bizarre conversation about sending a helium filled blow up doll over the town - which I am going to do!!!.. Arrived home at about 3 ish and slept until as long as Loki would let me. Continued the day and checked MS. There it was! Blog comments from Al, and a few emails waiting too. Cool!!! So yeah, swapped email addys and are keeping in touch.....friends only I must stress!....
Thanks Mands and Co for a really cool time."

"event","I woke up to the lovely sound of buzzing this morning. I'd left my window slightly open last night as it was fairly warm and a wasp must have seen this as an invitation to come into my home. So there it was buzzing around in the curtains quite happily until Loki spotted it! It was Loki's first experience of a buzzy,flying thing so was very intrigued to know what it was. He slowly strutted across to the windowsill to check this amusing object out. Buzzing around just above his head, he looked up quite surprised then launched himself to the top of the window, latching on to the curtain with his front claws. He's getting a very big lad now is Loki, and he soon found that out for himself as he started to slide down the curtain and ended up ripping it in half. Great! Now I have to spend a fortune on curtains... I can think of much better things to spend my hard earned cash on. Little sod!!>

"event","Well, guys and gals, this week has pretty much been a bloody good week for me. There's still a lot of hurt going on in there thats deep rooted for now, but all in all I have had the most excellent time. Firstly, without you guys giving supporting comments, I don't think I would have got this far. So thank you , you are worth your weight in gold and it really means a lot to me!

I've done a lot of self thinking over the past couple of days and so far I thought, well what did I get out of the relationship anyway? My answer 'Nothing', but I gave a lot, including hols to Romania, prague, London, love, food, a roof over his head etc etc. He's moved on without too much thinking of what he gained and what he lost. But I know this! He didn't deserve any of those things I did for him, so I deserve to give my love, friendship and everything else to my friends and family. The people to whom I mean as much to them as they do me. Eventually in time I'm sure I will find the right person and someone who isn't looking for an 'easy ticket'!

I also discovered a wonderful site called MySpace. So if you have a spot on there, add me. Just look for Mau. I only signed up a few days back, and have worked on my page and have met many friends with same interest...goth! It's a good place and you can look up for up coming bands and known bands and add a fave song to your page. Check it out!

So this is it! I'm shipping out and moving on in life. A friend of mine many years ago said to me. 'Whatever happens, happens for a reason, and believe in fate as the next time something happens, it will be far better. That is something I have always stored at the back of my mind. So be it!!"

Well, a certain nearest and dearest has......wait for it...dadaaaaaa.....decided to call it a day, says things dont feel right anymore, besides, no jobs round here for him, so as soon as the opportunity arises, he's heading into the sunset. Ohhhh doesn't matter about our feelings (mine and mims), doesnt even matter that we never even entered the 'Whats the possibility of  sorting things out and getting out of this place' equation. Personally, I think hes doing a runner into a brick wall which is exactly how I feel at this time. Time to become a 'hermit' for the next decade, me thinks."

"event","Well, just over a week or so ago, I decided to own another motorcycle, so I did! I went out and bought me a nice shiney new LS650 Savage. So off I trundled, bother, dad and daughter in tow to Yorkshire to collect it. Yes another fine product from ebay and jolly happy I am with it too. Nice size, good to the eye and hard on the ears...... perfect!!!! Just got iccle goth daughter new leathers so she can sit and look pretty at the age of 10. Wonderful. Heres to lots of joyous goth biking!! Yipeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Hit Lancaster last sat for the Halfsize - I mean, Halflife EBM, Goth, Industrial night, and I must say it was a truly great night. Good sounds old and new, lots of elder goths and copious amounts of alcohol. I wasnt pleased with my new pVC number falling to bits before I even got out of the door though. You know, if you travel somewhere to go out, it IS worth taking another outfit just in case......oh forgot, you lot are goths, that means an extra wardrobe! Heheheheh"

Well Just when I was sitting back completely bored, reminiscing on the past god knows how many months/years wondering why I was now sat in a chair, bored and achey and wondering what life was now going to throw at me next, it seems this year, I am doing more travelling than last year!! thats a competition in itself ahah. So last night saw me catching up with a dear old friend of many years who through my own fault (and yes I do admit it) drifted and did our own things - we sat and had wine and caught up on old times and planned our future trips like back in the old days. So theres lots of gothing and confidence getting to be done.... here there and everywhere it is!!! Yipeeee. I may even be down Brum(and other parts) to catch up with old friends from the Torri days./Northern nights..heheh Toxic.... if you see this.... we're coming to getchya!!! ahahahaha.....Morticutor... you can run but you can't hide ahahahahah!!!"

<b>Conventions: </b>Connecticon was this weekend! I haven&#39;t been there in several years and it&#39;s grown so much and it was a lot of fun. :) They had <i>so many</i> panels and fun guests. In a few weeks I&#39;ll be at Boston Comic Con with my partner and we&#39;ll have even more comic books! Seized issue 3 is ready for print, and we should have his Kickass McAwesome geeky-gamer book ready this week too. Then a week after that is ComiCONN in Bridgeport, CT.

<b>Fandom: </b><lj user=""hd-fan-fair"" /> and <lj user=""hd-fanart"" /> are holding fests now! I&#39;ve always enjoyed them both so I&#39;m excited."

One of my goals was to depict a dragon that ultimately wants to protect elves, despite the sacrifices. The shadow-monsters like dead things (especially elves). The dragon keeps the monsters content. Now they&#39;re out of bones.

<b>About:</b> The elves have a comfortable village that is safe as long as they keep the monsters away. Luckily, they have a dragon that looks out for them in exchange for a small sacrifice once each generation. What if that sacrifice is interrupted? Overall rating: PG13.

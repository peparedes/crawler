"event","Topic:i hate sharehouse.
boring,boring day.

ryan,one of the guys at the sharehouse,is a facist pig,and when i told him so,asked if i read the dictionary today.faggot shaves his legs.i like the black kid steven better than him,at least he's quiet.
i think i scared the little peckerhead when i growled at him this morning.literally growled,he was nagging about my chores.

it seems that every time someone does something that one of the workers dont like,theres a rule sying you cant do it.now thats fucked,cause everyone does/says everything differently,so are they going to ban being human?.

""but why dont you move out?""

i have nowhere else to go.

i hate sharehouse,and thats my rant for the day."

fuckin eventful weekend indeed.went out friday night,to the ex-y(theres no place like home)and got very fucked up as you do.me and godzilla were walking back home when the girls run to catch up,and we ended up waiting at the cab rank with them.then this redneck wanker was calling them fatties,so i think*if he says it again im fuckin him up* so he said it again,i turn around,knee him in the balls,get a few hits in(one of which missed him and hit kimbo,my bad)and then someone held me back.he starts yelling fatties again so i take my jacket and jesse's sid shirt off ,walk over,and drop him to the ground face first,getting in a few while he was down(there's no such thing as a fair fight).he gets up and congratulates on me defending the ""fatties"".this guy doesnt learn.so i get into him again,get pulled of by some random nigger,and as im getting up,cop a nicely delivered boot to the head.everything went black and one bit of my brain was like""what was that?""and the other bit was like""i dunno but were going down man""thud.didnt get knocked out but the closest ive been to.i find out later that i was taking on 2 black fellas at once(lord knows how)and that two random jackie-chan asain dudes jumped in after i hit the deck and started helping bazza kick arse.the next thing i remember was bryan leaning over me,dripping blood on me i might add,going ""dude u ok?"".all's well.the girls went home,as we did,feeling pretty proud of sticking up for our mates.

woke up the next day to find the local fairy had posted on here.hungover and wondering how the little fuck had found i had a lj,let alone been stupid enough to post in it.you KNEW very FUCKING CLEARLY that i despised you.i let it go,happy to let things be as they were.but that's alright,because some people in life have to be shown their place.and if its lower on the fucking totem pole them me,i'll remind them.

lauren been blocked from my journal,she wants to play petty games,fine.the only thing worse in life than a teenybopper who has no sense of what things are about,is a yuppie pretending that he/she does.the only way to know about life is to go and experience it first hand.and im sick of preaching this line,YOU FUCKING PEOPLE MAKE ME SICK.

anyway im getting bored with the net,so its back to exchange to kill the day.

oh yeah thanks to all the people who said hi and shit,and thanks to the ones who said dumb shit.you remind me that the world sucks for a reason,and that i've got something to fight against.

see ya guys."

today i slept ,waking at 9 ish thinking it was 4 ,being told the time so i slept for another 5 hours :D .
then went to the mall to hock my fone (again).me jesse and bryan were sitting at potato fare and jesse pointed out these faggots from town high,so with a mouthful of half-eaten hot dog i yelled abuse at them.not a fucking word came out of their mouts,i think they were half scared/confused by a midget freak with food in his mouth yelling at them.drinking with the usual suspects tonight,and an old freind who's in town.OH YEAH! and now if any FUCKHEADS are too scared to bitch to my face and hide behind livejournal when they do it,will be awarded half a left nut if they bitch in my journal.good luck,fuckers and fuckettes."

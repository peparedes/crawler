Fucking leave me alone, I don't care about your life so god damn much, and it's none of you rbusiness to begin with! So if I like someone, quite criticizing and freaking out... damn preps"

But I don't think I could say, ""Mom I need to update all of my journals online!"" when mother has to do the bills right? Either way, I will find a way on.

Anywayz, TAKS is over (thank goodness) and Six Flags is tomorrow! YEAH!!!!

That's all the updates right now. I will start to type in this regularly, I PROMISE!

"event","When I was at Pirate's house and we were about to go to the SMu trip, I was really sick. I ignored it htough, because I din't want to miss the trip. As the day went on I got sicker and sicker. When I got home, I was so sick I had to cancel the date with me and Levi :(. I was so pissed. Levi told me I should get some rest and that he loved me anyway. So I passed out. At the SMU trip my group was the only group who won out of the whole school. We won $500 for the school. Mrs. Thompson was pissed because she was the science teacher and her group didn't win! lol. It was so cool though. Pirate, Jeremy, Justin, and I were all in the same group. I wish levi was there he would've loved it. Well my tylenol is kicking in. I didn't realize unitl after I took the 4 pills that the bottle said 'may cause drowziness"". In other words, I picked up the wrong bottle. Thats how sick i am...:("

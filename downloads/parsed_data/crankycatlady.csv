Apparently, he was supposed to speak in front of an image of Walter Reed Medical Center.  Instead, his handlers mistakenly put up this image of Walter Reed Middle School, in North Hollywood.  I guess they just Googled ""Walter Reed"" and thought nothing more of it.

I think Season 2 starts next Sunday night.

"event","It's here!  It's what you've all been waiting for!  The Clot takes a look back at the year that was.

Some of you are probably wondering, ""The Clot?  What?  Who?""  The Clot was born a few years ago, in response to a troll invasion on a childfree message board I used to frequent.  An anti-abortionist started yapping about a fetus already having a face, arms, etc... and someone else replied that it was ""just a clot.""  It inspired me to create The Clot.  He's a plucky little guy, and as you can see he gets around.  He kinda grows on you.  If you'd like to see what The Clot was up to in previous years, you can see for yourself at these spots:

2005:  http://crankycatlady.livejournal.com/202816.html
2006:  http://crankycatlady.livejournal.com/360121.html

(Yes, I'm sitting around the house on New Years Eve posting Clot art.  I am a loser.  I've been sick all week, and I've worked 70 hours.  I backed out of going to a party, because I don't have much of a voice, and I've been having coughing fits that make me pull over to the side of the road with tears coming down my face.  There was also an informal fix-up involved tonight, and I'm too sick to put my best foot forward... besides, he has kids).

And without further ado... See what The Clot was up to in 2007 (behind the cut) [not for those who abhor bad taste]

<lj-cut>

The Clot found himself in a love triangle.  The lovebug made him so desperate, that he drove all night and wore diapers so he wouldn't have to stop for a bathroom break.  

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=astroclot.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/astroclot.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Luckily, the grim reaper stepped in and knocked that embarrassing astroclot out of the tabloids.  The Clot died in a Hollywood, Florida hotel room:

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=anna-nicole-clot.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/anna-nicole-clot.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

The Clot rose from the dead, because there were still 10 months left in the year, and he wanted to make the most of it.  I can't say I condone how he did it, though.  The Clot went on a massive shooting spree at Virginia Tech:

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=vt-clot-guns.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/vt-clot-guns.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

He ran off to Portugal on holiday with his parents, where he went missing:

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=missing-clot.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/missing-clot.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

The Clot didn't stop believing in 2007, and he went on and on and on, in one of TV's best series finales ever:

As summer kicked off, The Clot became the hottest must-have item of the year:

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=iClot.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/iClot.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Like most Americans, The Clot did a little traveling during the summer, changing planes at the Minneapolis airport.  In 2007, The Clot was not gay, and had never been gay:

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=clot-larry-craig.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/clot-larry-craig.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

The Clot hit the campaign trail, running for President:

The Clot ran for Miss Teen America, as Miss South Carolina.  ""Our Clot for South Africa and Iraq will be unable, or, uh, ... South Africa, and such, should help in South Africa, and Iraq, and such, should help in Iraq...""

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=miss-south-carolina.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/miss-south-carolina.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

And finally, in 2007, The Clot coined the year's catch phrase:  ""Don't Tase Me Clot!""

<a href=""http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/?action=view&amp;current=dont-tase-me-clot.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y21/crankycatlady/dont-tase-me-clot.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

The last commercial is for Masterpiece, probably the greatest game ever invented.  As an adult visiting the Chicago Art Institute, I couldn't get over how many ""Masterpiece game"" paintings were there, and they all seemed dearly familiar to me.

Many of you know that I once crashed a Southern child beauty pageant.  In fact, it was two years ago this weekend.  You can read about it here http://crankycatlady.livejournal.com/2005/07/23/  and here http://crankycatlady.livejournal.com/2005/07/24/

Read about the adventures of this poor sap, who somehow got dragged into entering his 5-month-old son in a mall child beauty pageant.  Revel in the fact that it will never be you.

<i>""I entered my son in a children's beauty contest because I thought it would make a good story. Why do seemingly rational adults doll up their children and parade them around in front of strangers? Is it creepy or silly or something else entirely? Entering Henry would give me a chance to see pageants in a way I never could as an outsider, to delve into the meaning of it all and, perhaps, to poke a little fun along the way.  At least that was the idea. By the end, though, I just wanted to win.""</i>

"event","Remember this pretentious website for a new apartment complex called Deveraux Glen?  <lj user=""ghstintheshl""> originally brought it to our attention before it was built, because the ""lifestyle"" the website was pushing just didn't match its location -- a brand new suburban blight,  by a freeway and across from Outback Steakhouse.  We live near it and thought it was funny, because this is definitely not the Pearl District.  Pearly people won't be sold on this location.

http://www.deverauxglen.com/index.htm

""Secluded yes.""  ""The lifestyle you've always imagined.""

Over the past year, I've watched this complex being built and laughed at the difference between what appeared to my untrained eye as really shoddy construction and the marketing of the website.

I drove <lj user=""gutterboylive""> around there a few months ago, and he couldn't believe how cheap and ugly it was.

Now people are living there, and they're not happy.  I heard some second-hand things about it yesterday, and then checked what apartmentratings.com are saying.

Already, there are problems -- no parking, <b>mold</b>, lights shorting out, no heat in bedrooms, poor insulation, construction messes... 

Enjoy:

""It's over priced. The staffs are very dishonest. Parking is horrible. We were forced to buy the garage and reserved spot. The situation will only get worse. <b>We have mold on our bathroom wall, bedroom wall, and all over the windows. When this happened, maintenance didn't show up on time nor clear up their mess. <u>The manager blames us for the whole situation</u>, such as we don't open our bedroom door often or we feeling sick was not because of the mold, instead, it was cold season!!??</b> The wall is paper thin, I can easily be waken up by people next WALL. They lied to us about our garage location. We have to park cross the street and walk to our home in the rain. I regret moving in this place, and I do not recommend this place to anyone.""

""They want you to believe this is Luxury, but it is far from it. W<b>e already have black mold and cracks in the wall!! Not to mention the carpet has been pulling up since day one.""</b>

""We've delt with mold, flooding, and an eyesore of constuction from our back deck since the day we moved in. The hot tub that we were told ""Would be finished in ten days"" after we moved in (July 2006), is still an ugly site scene from our back patio. In my last review, I said there was just a huge hole in the ground with constuction littering the area. Now, <b>there is an actual hot tub in that hole, only it's full of about 3 feet dirty, misquito breeding rainwater.</b> Orange netting now circles the entire area, and as a whole it is even more of an absolute eye sore. The hot tub went in about 3 months ago, and it has sat, untouched, ever since. No one has filled in the hole around it, no pipes connected, nothing. It's acutally become a joke with my friends. Not funny.

""We toyed with the idea of breaking our lease. My roomate and I are recieving a discount for all of the crap we have had to deal with while living at Deveraux Glen <b>Our first apartment had to be torn down due to water damage, and the one we're in now had to have walls torn down due to mold.</b> Management told us in order to break our lease, we have to pay back that entire discount, plus two months rent. Which would amount to $3000. Give me a break. Can't they understand how much we are dealing with and just be humans for once?""

""the insulation is terrible. You can clearly hear normal level conversations through the walls. We feel as though we have to whisper so our neighbors don't hear private conversations when we're in certain rooms.""

""Whatever you do, DO NOT even consider moving here. The building, although new, is not worth the money. The buildings are built cheaply and have many problems already. We even had mold growing through the walls of our place and could not get anyone to fix it. The lease is about 30 pages long and covers them from all angles, so you are left with no options other than to accept it. We finally paid the money just to break the lease and put the nightmare behind us.
The management is rude, the parking is a nightmare, the buildings are not built well. Overall, for your money you would be happier looking elsewhere.""

""These apartments are built fast and with NO quality. Within the first 5 weeks there was significant moisture growing on our windows, our hot water heater had gone out 4 times and our water had gone out completely. Not only that, but we can hear our neighbors when they are having a normal conversation.""

Wow.  Live the dream!"

When the manager brought my change, I asked ""is my server off shift or something?""  He merely replied, ""No, she's got the whole place to cover.""  Erm... it's 4:00 and there are only a few people in the whole place.

I could also hear her in the kitchen earlier, having a loud conversation with a cook, interspersing her talk with ""fuck,"" and ""I was like so pissed at her...""  I'm not one to be shocked by language, but it seems a little crude for restaurant patrons to be able to overhear.  It's a very casual place, but still.

"event","I found this on a blog and thought you'd get some laughs out of it.  While I don't care for the arrogant attitude that's permeated Portland over the past few years, I get a kick out of how the natives use Californians as scape goats.  

<b>Californians</b>

""Fuck you if you don?t love our town and treat her the way she deserves to be treated. The meth heads & gangsters are nasty shits [TPM 7/14], but the average LA asshole also poses a direct threat to our way of life. So, to all of you who recently moved here from California
your arrival pardons all of those who came before you, because you assholes have brought with you some extra sick shit. 

""You act like Oregonians were wallowing in mud puddles and living in caves before you graced us with your inflated & arrogant bullshit. The Sunset Highway is nothing like the Santa Monica Freeway, stop driving like shitheads. If you?re gonna live here register your car here. I?m sick of seeing those boring CA plates every-fucking-where. 

""Slow up on the gortex in July, enjoy the summer showers. Stop over bidding on shitty houses that are already over priced. Your crazy real estate greed is making it so locals may never be able to buy a house. Stop walking around like you are in some fucking corporate mall when you are shopping in neighborhoods full of locally owned businesses where people also actually live. Stop acting like greedy self-centered assholes as you try to out-maneuver everyone in your way. Sometimes you have to wait in line at a store, stop for pedestrians or yield to cyclists that?s the way it goes here. Stop acting like you?re the only person on the fucking planet. 

""We were a thriving, interesting, eclectic, liberal community before you brought your LA baggage to town ? fake tits, over bleached blondes, tans & Gucci handbags are not how Portland identifies itself. What are ya gonna do when the money runs out and you actually have to get a job? We know who you are; you stick out like dick cheney at the Oregon Country Fair. You suck. You could integrate without being so offensive and invasive if you would just pull your heads out of your asses, wake up, take a deep breath, slow down, get out of your selfish egocentric bubbles and pay attention to your new community, the community that you chose to move to, or go the fuck away."""

"event","This story is about a showdown between neighbors -- Democrats vs. Republicans; rural vs. urban; rich vs. poor.  Oh yeah, and it was instigated by Elizabeth Edwards, wife of John Edwards, who is running on his ""Two Americas"" platform.

As you probably already know, the Edwards family recently sold their large house in Raleigh and built a 28,000 square-foot monstrosity in the outskirts of Chapel Hill.  The ""son of a millworker"" ought to have expected they'd have neighbors like this, so I don't understand why the snobby remarks from Mrs. Edwards.

This is their neighbor:

Apparently, Mrs. Edwards called him a ""rabid, rabid Republican"" and won't let her children play near his property. 

According to the <a href=""http://www.newsobserver.com/114/story/562899.html"">Raleigh News-Observer</a>, <i>""Johnson didn't rebut Edwards' comments. He's a proud member of the Grand Old Party and owns a 9 mm handgun he said he's not afraid to use.  <b>What got his goat, he says, was Edwards' calling his 42-acre property 'slummy.'</b>

""Johnson rents one of the two buildings at the front of his property to a mechanic. The gravel lot is strewn with cars waiting to get fixed... Johnson thinks the Edwardses don't like him because he put up a sign along Old Greensboro Road that reads: 'Go Rudy Giuliani 2008.' The couple has to read it every time they pull into their winding driveway.  He also left an abandoned house facing their property. But he said he was born there and doesn't have the money to fix it up or the heart to tear it down...

""In the meantime, Johnson said he doesn't have hard feelings toward Edwards, but he does expect her to say she's sorry. 'I think she owes me an apology,' he said. 'And I won't feel right until I get it. <b>If this is how they treat people in the White House, America is in for a helluva time.</b>'""</i>

"event","I guess it was inevitable.  My old stomping grounds are being invaded by monster houses.  On Thursday, I took pictures of these two abominations:

1.  This is the tract just behind my blight.  These are 1200 - 1500 square-foot modest houses built in the 50's.  Of course nowadays, that is MUCH TOO SMALL, so they must be torn down and replaced with towering ego monuments.  Look how the back of this new house dwarfs the existing houses:

2.  My blight, built in 1970, has slightly larger houses, in the 1600 - 2000 square-foot range.  Plenty big for famblees of the 70's, but still unacceptable to parents of the 21st century.  The latest owners created this one, RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from my mom's house.  Note the three set of fake columns that serve no practical purpose.

I guess no neighborhood is safe.  If you want to buy a mid-century modest house, in an unassuming neighborhood, you can still end up being surrounded by McMansions."

People are still getting killed in LA, but it's just not a big deal anymore.  In fact, the LA Times is <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/homicidereport/"">doing something about it</a> with their Homicide Reports.  It's a special section, really just a log, of names and such of people who have been murdered this year, week-by-week.

So murder is that common now?  So common, it took the novelty of a Times reader to volunteer making a map, plotting all the murders that have happened so far in 2007:

"event","In the past couple of months, I've seen a fair amount of movies.  It's the time of year when better movies tend to be released, and of course it's Oscar season.

Last night, I saw 'Babel' with <lj user=""cinda29"">.  I loved it, and she didn't care for it.  I've heard this split reaction from others about 'Babel.'  How many of you have seen it, and what did you think?

In the Best Picture category, I've seen four of the five nominated films.  I'll try to squeeze in 'The Departed' this weekend, if I can.

<b>And the nominees for Best Picture are:</b>
*Babel
*The Departed
*Letters From Iwo Jima
*Little Miss Sunshine
*The Queen

I'm going to go with Babel, although Letters From Iwo Jima was also very well done.  I was thinking that the Academy would give Best Picture to Babel and give a nod to Clint Eastwood with a Best Directing award for Iwo Jima, until I realized Martin Scorsese has never won an Academy Award.  It's about time he did, so that leaves my other two bets as toss-ups.

For <b>Best Actress</b>, I have to go with Helen Mirren.  This was an exceptionally strong category this year, but she WAS The Queen.  

For <b>Best Actor</b>... I haven't seen any of those films.

For <b>Best Supporting Actress</b>, I vote for Adriana Barraza, as the Mexican nanny to the innocent blonde yuppie children in Babel.  She was great!  I was happy to see Abigail Breslin be nominated, but she doesn't deserve to win.  I do want to learn the dance she performed at the pageant.

For <b>Best Supporting Actor</b>, I haven't seen Blood Diamond, Dreamgirls, or The Departed, so /John Belushi/based on what I've seen/John Belushi/, I'll have to go with Jackie Earle Haley for Little Children.  

BTW, if you enjoy dark and cynical views of modern American suburban paranoia, Little Children is not to be missed.

And of course, Al Gore is going to win for An Inconvenient Truth.

Best Sound Editing, Best Visual Effects In An Animated Foreign Film... who cares?"

Usually, I run errands on a weekday, but today I went to Target to stock up on non-foods.  I had forgotten how crowded and frustrating that can be.  I know by being there, I too am adding to the crowds, but I try not to act like a Neanderthal.  

Why do so many people park their carts in the middle of the aisles?  
Why do so many people let their toddlers roam free, let them run in front of your cart and then give you a dirty look?  
Why do so many people just burst into a main aisle from a side one, without looking for oncoming traffic?  
Why do so many people just stop and gape in the middle of cart traffic, for no reason?  
When there's a cart traffic jam and others are courteously trying to maneuver along with everyone else, do some people think they deserve to just barge right through full steam ahead?  

There.  I feel better."

This photo doesn't being to depict the squallor in the boarding area at LAX yesterday.  They encircled me.  Despite there being some available seats, they camped out on the floor, and the place resembled a Third World country.  I wish I'd had the cajones to take pictures in a 360-degree circle, but this was the least intrusive one I could get.

The noise was horrible.  Screaming and screeching all around.  Toddlers running and thapping their feet with what sounded like 200 pounds of weight, whizzing by despite carry-on luggage obstacles that threatened to trip them.  Parents staring bovinely out the window.  

I don't know who was smiling upon me, but I was up front and they were all far back enough not to be heard, once I had the iPod going.

Why are some flights peaceful adult havens (like Friday night's) and some are nursery schools in a metal tube?  Why do most parents just don't give a damn about teaching their kids manners in public?  Maybe it's a sign of the times, but I didn't even fly until I was 10."

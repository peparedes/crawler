"event","ok, I'm turning into an Ebay addict *really* quick...

the wife gave me her ok to get a new camcorder before <a href=""http://www.cornerstonefestival.com"">Cornerstone</a> this summer...

I like the looks of the Panasonic pv-dv953 Mini DV Camcorder

It's a little cheaper than the Sony DCR-TRV950 Mini DV Camcorder...

I just know my little el-cheapo Samsung isn't cutting the mustard...it has trouble keeping focus, and the image color just isn't all there..."

"event","well, we're finally breaking out the pop-up for spring and going camping this weekend.  <a href=""http://www.mcconvention.org/2004/index.html"">The Missouri Christian Convention</a> is this weekend at the Lake of the Ozarks, and we'll set up camp just around the corner from the lodge.  Hopefully the sun will shine and we will not need the winter long johns.  However, i think it's still a bit early in the year for swimming in the lake.

We bought the camper for <a href=""http://www.cornerstonefestival.com/index.cfm"">Cornerstone</a> last year, and we've been able to put it to good use.  I don't know if we'll be like many other pop-up owners and sell it after the kids grow up a bit and hate sharing a bed.  Just have to wait and see on that one.  I know the camper is a real life-saver for C-stone, though.  Being able to live up off the ground...to have some shade...and a hard top over your head that shouldn't blow away...can be really nice.  Including this weekend and C-stone, we already plan to be out 6 times this summer.  Our kids keep wanting to pop it up in the front yard and spend a night out there..

There is a drawback to camping.  The cableline for the modem will not reach out of town.  So, I guess I go unplugged for a while.  I hate being cut-off from my electronic things.  Not all things, though.  We just bought a lil microwave so I can have popcorn out in the semi-wilderness.  Now, I could bring along my wife's apple laptop.  But that is just a waste of electricity -- just an expensive portable dvd player in my eyes.  

And I have my first C-stone conflict of the year...choosing between the Glen Kaiser Band and Starflyer 59....choices, choices...the only other conflict will be over how much time I spend at the Gallery vs the PT Press Tent..."

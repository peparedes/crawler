"event","ok so i was read my horoscope(they are always right for me i dont know about you.) well anyway this is what mine said:

 ""you'll come across all lovey-dovey this month, especially on the 8th, when the sun aspects Venus, the planet of affection. but if you put those you admire on too high a pedestal, thay may go tumbing when Venus squares off with Jupiter on the 19th. this will hurt you as much as it will hurt them.""

so great if my ""love life"" didn't already SUCK this has to make it worse. if i didnt already hurt! motherfucker! erkfjl;ksdjfl;aksjdflkdsjfladskjflsdkjfasl;dkjf;kdjfk

"event","well today we went whale watching. it was fun i guess but the real fun started when i went to laynie's with zoe! good times!

we went to walk around and of course laynie had to scare us about the park so we went a different way untill we thought to go to Lina's house. she wasn't home but it was ok because ""our best friends"" (her parents) were there. so we talked to them for a little until we thought to walk to cedarbrook to get Lina. that was VERY fun on the way there. well then we went back to Lina's and watched friends and stuff. and i found out that i only have four friends which is pretty sad. 

EW i hate when people are all over someone and like sexing it up in front of everyone and there so sluting and djf;ekjd. i hate even more when my friend is all over the kid that one of my best friends really like and the friend knows it. but still she keeps laying on top of him! god! leading people on is so not cool."

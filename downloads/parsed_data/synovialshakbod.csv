"event","nineteen days... it has been since my last entry.  i am very sorry peeps, i know you look forward to seeing these everyday.... okay i'm the only one who looks forward to these. but anyways, there's alot to talk about. prom turned out pretty good despite the events that conspired before hand.  ha ha, it was kind of funny.  i mean i was a little mad when i first heard about it (which was two days before anyone knew that i knew. i was trying to keep it on the DL) but there's really no point in staying mad about, plus i already knew it was going to happen before it happened so i was prepared.  anyways i have to make my exit.  so STOP WASTING MY TIME... just kidding.  Peace."

"event","not much on my mind....well...we all have our problems in life.  for me, though, all of mine are kind of weak and pitiful.  the biggest problem i have is deciding what i'm going to eat when i go on break at work.  but even in depressing times in life when you just want to feel sorry..i just think about the sacrifice of jesus.  any problem i have is nothing compared to that.  so instead of getting stressed out or somethin', i just think nothing of it and just live.  the best advice i've ever given is ""just roll with it"".....don't ask.  anyways, stay cool my fans.  Peace."

"event","i'm back.  it has been awhile. i know you have been missing these little meaningless entries which have nothing to do with anything. but hey...what can i say...........................................................................................................................................................................................obviously nothing.  anyways, on to bigger and better things, i have decided to attend a pigeon john concert in oklahoma city on may 9th.  i least i hope i get to.  oh yeah, lent is over...or is it spelled ""lint"". i'm not really sure.  if you know how to spell it, hit me up(that's slang for ""tell me"").  anyways, prom is soon arriving.  i can feel the warmth of its sunrays beaming down upon my back. i look into it with glimmer of hope that this day will very well begin..."

"event","it's been a while since i've updated my journal. it has been spring break.  it was fun except when i got arrested in Columbia (nah i'm just kidding).  anyways ms. bryan has just made her triumphant return in choctaw class.  she's been gone for the past couple of weeks or ... maybe we're the ones who have been gone.  either way we haver missed choctaw class.  i almost forgot the language!  but i think she might call upon us soon, very soon. (a disturbance rises from the east. i look to the ceiling with a concerned look on my face) it is time..."

"event","today has been normal. but what is normal. people assume it is a bad thing to be different, but different is the opposite of normal so why would anyone want to be normal. normality is something that the mind tells you and it says that to be normal is a good thing.  i have to work tonight. it should be fun. Peace."

"event","this is my first journal entry.  i don't have anything else to do, so i decided i would type in my journal.  right now kelly is checking his e-mail.  he emptied his bulk mail without checking it.  i thought this was absurd!  what if he was to get something important in there.  he claims that everything important will go to his inbox.  well, my pigeon john newsletter comes to my bulk mail and that is important.  anyways, fatigue is setting in and my eyes are getting heavy, so i better wrap it up.  
Peace..."

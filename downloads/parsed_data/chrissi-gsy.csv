"event","Have not been on here in a long time....mainly due to the fact I reached my goal but its steadily slipped away again.
Back at school,&nbsp;with A Levels putting more and more pressure on me it's going crazy. Finally my weight is going back down again and I've decided its going to stay down this time!!!
No more calorific crap, no more binge eating and feeling guilty. Just lots of healthy fasting, green tea and an insane amount of exercise. Wish me luck!!!

"event","&nbsp;Haven't been on this in absolute ages but have no where else to go today!
I 'm getting fatter by the day....stupid bloody summer holidays....but yesterday I began a fast and i'm doing an hour and a half of yoga every morning and then an hour jogging in the afternoon so things are looking up. Green tea has become my new favourite drink....yummy!
Prom on friday....I took my stupdily expensive dress back today because i'm not going anymore....it made me look fat and my mom is not the most encouraging. She kept telling me I looked fat in it...just because she's a stupid size 0! grr!

Defo want to lose more weight....maybe 15 pounds...&nbsp;by summer....and grow at least two inches taller! There you go-my two aims for the next two weeks! I will acheive it....I can exercise as much as I want and eat as little as I want easily because i'm the only one at home! Thank god for GCSE's lol!

"event","Well here I am on my fourth day of fasting.
All I ate yesterday was:
Two bottles of water
Two sticks of sugar free gum&nbsp;
And one piece of lemon.

I'm actually really happy with myself but I woke up this morning and without thinking I went straight into the kitchen and made a bowl of cereal because I was so hungry. Luckily I realised what I was doing and tipped it into the bin. Now I'm occupying myself with this so I dont get hungry or feel like eating!!

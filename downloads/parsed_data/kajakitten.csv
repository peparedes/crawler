"event","so, after break I'll spend the following 2 months in Alabama working with Habitat for Humanity. Again. In the hottest part of the summer. Good thing I don't mind the heat and humidity, huh? I'm glad it's a place I've never been before. We'll get back to Denver the day after tomorrow, today we got stuck in traffic for ages because of an accident that somehow left trash (like cruched cans) all over part of the freeway.

Also.
For some reason, everyone seems to get it wrong when they try to figure out what I am. The older men just jump straight to 14 year old boy, and then most people think I'm maybe 15 or 16, but they get the proper gender, and then a statistically significant number of people think I'm a lesbian. Which isn't that big a problem, except that it's not true. I think it's weird that I'm that hard to figure out.
Whatever. People are really unobservant. At least little kids ask what gender I am, instead of assuming and getting it wrong. And I don't really look that much like a boy, I don't think, I mean, I have at least a little bit of a chest...
Whatever.
It's just strange. One of the HFH staff's roommate asked her if I was her girlfriend yesterday after meeting me for a few minutes.
All I was doing was repairing a bicycle tire. And wearing uniform.
People are strange."

We're currently in St Louis, Missouri. 
We went up in the arch, and looked at some stuff, and got new tires for the van, mainly.
Supposedly we'll be chainsaw trained tomorrow and head to Lebanon (I love all these cities named the same as countries). I'd never been to St Louis before so it's been nice. We're sataying at the AmeriCorps St. Louis HQ. We have cots, mostly, but I have a piece of floor. It's very comfortable. They brought us lunch today, BBQ, pretty good.
Wer have been told that we'd be chainsaw trained on Saturday. but that didn't happen, so we went and saw stuff, and then maybe today, but that didn't happen, so we did nothing.
It feels timeless in here, there are very few windows and it has been raining. The second years are cool, of course, we've almost all got laptops, (because we know what will make us happy while we hurry up and wait), and lots of movies, so we just watched sneakers.
It was nice.
I don't really know what stuff will be like at the next places we go, just that we'll have showers.
Here we have one, and it's in a supply closet.
Oh, yes - we ""accidentally"" got locked in a closet today. It was amusing
The closet locks when you close it, see.

We walked the two miles back from the train station with my suitcases, which, though they have wheels, the green one is a BOTHER to move anywhere. My shoulders are therefore sore. Then we got on the bus, and went and got mee a bus pass and traded in my dad's gift certificate for working at the UM medical center (caring for computers, not people) for over 25 years. Then we walked downtown Minneapolis - I realized that I almost never ever go to downtown minneapolis.
We walked through loring park and looked down on the sculpture garden by the Walker Art Museum  Spoon Bridge With Cherry and all the other old faborites. They took down the Guthrie theater next to the Walker, and put up a new, blue, Guthrie Theater on the eastern edge of downtown (Minneapolis), near the Metrodome. Daddy made yummy dinner, we watched one episode of Stargate...
I packed my bags a bit hurriedly this time, leading to a very heavy smaller bag because it contained 8 seasons of stargate and the latter half of the Harry Potter Series, two thirds of which I have in hard cover. I found an electrical outlet in my room which acceps a ground prong. I enjoyed the train ride, I sat next to the same man for the whole ride, because we both came from Seattle to MSP, and the train was rather full. It was amusing - he'd been a lot of the same places as I went in NCCC, joined teh Navy when he was 32 and worked with the boilers, and we talked about Beaumont TX, and Louisiana, and steam powered ships, and the Navy, and mentioned the same landmarks and then recognized them, never mind that we were on the other side of the country.

I think that boys and oceans are a bad combination. I danced a little, ate some...

Happy new year if you would like, people, and if not, then I shall not wish it upon you."

"event","Sitting in the Portland Marriot, we went swimming in their pool this morning, and last night ate dinner at an expensive and nice restaurant, which made me realize that I expect expensive food to be not very good.
I'm connected via the Portland Wireless Internet thingy that they're doing - they're wireless-ing the whole city.
It's nice. I'll get back to Issaquah tonight LATE, or tomorrow morning. I'll only be in Issaquah for a few more days because we're spending the weekend on Vashon Island, so...

I got some socks for Christmas yesterday from Will's relatives (we ate at their house and chatted with them)AND a very nice B&N gift card.
My mom' wants to check her e-mail.

Mom and Bro went to take Bro to the airport, and Mom's not coming home until tomorrow.
I have the house to myself - this means that I can do all the required mopping, vacuuming, laundry etc.
We got power right about 4:15 PM today - about3.5 days without power.
This was about 2 minutes before I walked in the door.
I'm sitting by the heater.

Since the power went out in Issaquah and was not on again at ALL when we left at two, and since we stayed at Valerie's party until 1:00, Iam, urrently, rather than at home, on my mother's boyfriend's couch. I know I shouldn't, really shouldn't, say this, but...
This would NEVER happen in MN.
Power wouldn't be out for more than a few hours at all, anyway. There, it's more of a thing where you wake up at 1:00 when a transformer goes, briefly, realize the power's out, go bqck to sleep and wake up to flashing clocks.
On the other hand, power outages are very good for the environment. 
Contrary to popular belief, all pollution does not come from cars and trash and chemicals. Another great source of polution is coal power plants. So simply switching to electrical buses instead of diesel buses doesn't actually help the environment, because you're just moving the pollution. Air quality indexes go up incredibly when a power plant works way below normal.
Good night."

how are you?
if any of you are in town before the 3rd of January, I might be around.
I leave the 3rd in the afternoon, train to MN, then to Denver
the 10 more months.
I wonder...
well, I'm sure I will find out someday.

Today was one of those days which is relaxingly, fulfillingly buzy. I got my finerprints, tried to get my diploma (no such luck, but they do think I've graduated. They just couldn't find it), mailed my fingerprints, had jack In The Box for lunch, went to Michaels, Linens n things, BN, and most of the other places in that shopping center, and then watched Casino Royale, which I, personally, liked. Which means that I don't advise anyone to see it. I liked it, you won't, and I don't want you to dislike a movie that I like.
I got carrot-orange juice on the way home, and some small knitting needles, and then ate eggplant parmisan and watched Castle In The Sky (Hayao Miyazaki)
At IHS, I saw Mary, Kellie's sister. She thought I was a staffperson for about two seconds.
:-)

Last night I started reading two books - One on games theory and one on evolutionary development.
Very interesting..."

I cooked passable cornbread.
I watched 49up

I don't really know what I'm supposed to feel, but I feel the same as usual, I'll miss people, It'll be different, but life just keeps going, so it doesn't matter what you think about things you can't change they're still going to happen.
So, just go along with it.

hooray for laptops with batteries
We went to turn in the vans - this means that we went out the door to the parking lot, got in the vans and drove them around to the back of the building. During that time, the power went out.
So, we were walking around in the basement, turning stuff in.
It was dark. Apparently my eyes adjust easily to the darkness, because CJ went into the laundry room, which wasn't pitch black (because there was light from Fred's office window filtering through his doorway and into the hall next to the laundry room), but it was kind of dark. I could see CJ, and he couldn't see me at all.
I was explaining thatI could see his ars and his arms, and pproving it by touching them, and whn I touched his elbow, there was a spark of static electricity.
It was cool
But now the power's back

I also just got ITunes"

None.
I have one pair of jeans that actually fit nicely, and I have a few shirts that aren't T-shirts.
That's about it.
Maybe I'll wear a shirt and jeans.
amazing, I know.
Lunch is in 8 minutes. 
This morning, I only got out of bed because Caroline came and knocked on my door and said - you know you have a room inspection now, right?
I looked at her.
I need to unpack and repack and find Mark Neil with my SG1

Okay.
One, it's hard to type on a laptop while wearing a watch.
Two, I should just throwthe watch away, it's getting ratty and slow.
Or I could take it apart... OoO...
Three, today was clothing turn in and exit form fill out time.
Four, tonight, there was the AmeriPlay.
Five, today and tonight is super cleaning time.
SUPER cleaning time.
Like, toothbrushes.
I need to finish packing, and to take the stuff to Marion Hall that I'm taking to Marion Hall - I'm leaving stuff here for the two months, because it'd be silly to take it home.
Oh, did I tell you?
I'm going to do AmeriCorps again next year, exact same as this time.It'll be good.
I just found out today.
Of course, I didn't apply until a week ago, so that's not bad.
Actually, it was last Tuesday.
So, 6 days including three non-work days (Saturday, Sunday and Veteran's Day Friday), that's pretty fast.
I haven't told my mom yet.
I told my ad because he called me tonight.
I ought to be packing and cleaning, but I can't stand the thought of doing that more right now.
I finished mopping/cleaning under the desks and one bed and the fridge, so I've only got to get under the other bed and the middle and the entryway.
And throw out some stuff.
Tomorrow we clean and outprocess, Wednesday we graduate, and Thursday we leave.
EEEEE!
I have the hiccups.
My fingernails are destroyed, they have been for some time.
I really, really ought to pack.
and then clean, and go to bed -we have a meeting at 1000 tomorrow morning.
I really will go now,
Frieda

Oh.
And, 
Six, I had a totally awesome dream in the morning, because I was tired because we got back at 2:30, so I sleptish more. I love how I can only tell my dreams from reality because they haven't happened.
Anyway, it was a project here, and there was a kid, and I was carrying him, and my legs kept getting tired so I'd have to switch positions and then walk ten more steps."

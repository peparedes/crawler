"event","I just came from business law and I know I sound like a huge dork, but it is my favorite part of my day. My roommates are going to country night, but I think I'm going to study tonight because I feel more studious now than I've felt in a while. On that note, I will share my horrible course schedule with you for next semester, which, oddly, I'm kind of looking forward to.

Summer:
FIN 301- Intermediate Business Finance
FIN 401- Principles of Investments and Security Markets

Fall '06:
FIN 351- Insurance
BLS 464- International Bus. Law
ACC 464- Tax Accounting
MGT 302- Operations Management (I dropped this class this sem. bc I am a retarded)
ECO 301- Money and Banking
ENG 338- Black Literature
ART 160- Begining Ceramics
BLS 235- Mock Trial Practicum

so yeah...six ""real"" classes @ 3 credit hours each =18 hours, plus 1 hour of ceramics and 1 hour of mock trial= 20 lovely credit hours, and 16 of those in the business school. I better make a lot of $$$ some day. And you wonder, ""why do you have to take 20 hours of pure shit courses?"" Because I dropped classes and took horseback riding, power walking, and wood working this semester. I rock."

"event","so i'm sitting in a study room (at a Miami branch campus(b/c i all the oxford mkt'ing classes were full), that's pretty key here) and this guy starts talking to me. He asked me what my sign was, then got on his laptop so see if we were a ""match,"" and apparently we were. and then he read our ""couples horoscope."" so then he asked me if i wanted to leave with him because he was ""antsy in his pantsy."" I of course declined. Then he asked me if i would at least go and get high with him. another no. so he left, and i was relieved.
Then he came back, and gave me a green sucker. His explanation for this was that it is ""a fact that green dye in candy makes you horny."" Then I left. Totally disgusting/outrageous. 
This was probably one of the most awkward experiences I have ever been in.

P.S.: I also learned that he has a 4 yr old son.

ACC 225-The Accounting Process, 4:00 pm - 5:15 pm MW (1 cr) (this one is over feb 10).

ENG 143, American Lit 1945-Present, 9:30 am - 10:45 am TR (3 cr).
FIN 301, Business Finance, 11:00 am - 12:15 pm TR (3 cr).

**I'm going to try to force add into a different MGT 302 class so I will have MWF free after Feb 10 (Boston!!). I am also trying to get into ENG 256 (I would drop eng 143), which is Russian Literature in English Translation, and it also fufills one of my international business electives (my minor).

Speaking of my non-existant attention span, today in accounting our prof was using an overhead to show us different examples of how warranties and discounts, etc are handled. Except, there was a tiny little bug crawling around on it, and instead of paying attention, I zone out and watch the bug move around.

Also, I went to go drop my golf class. I just kinda stopped going to class, and after 3 absences you dont get credit. It's a credit/no-credil class, but I did learn that the prof can still give me a WF, but it wouldnt affect my GPA. That would still suck though from a stupid credit/no credit golf class.

<P><lj-cut text=""Boring rant about declaring my major""><BR>Tomorrow I have an advising appointment. I need to declare my thematic sequence and concentration, but I think I'm going to wait. I still have some core business classes left to take before I had to decide. Lately I've been having little panic attacks about declaring a major. Do people actually enjoy business classes? I mean, I def think econ is interesting, but am I supposed to enjoy learning about depriciation and cash flow and bonds when I walk into acccounting? I freak out about having to choose something I want to do for the rest of my life, then I think I know, and then the next week I'm panicking again. If I were not going to major in something business, I would be a public relations major and marketing minor.&nbsp; Their salaries are not so hot,&nbsp; a lot of the time, though, esp starting out. People always say that money doesnt buy happiness, and that if you love your job that money is less important. I dont think that's true, at least entirely. I think after a certain amount of money, then it's true. But without money and a desired lifestyle you're sure to be unhappy. I actually learned about this in economics.<BR>So, I guess if I keep on with my something business major, which is still what I'm planning on, I need to decide on a thematic sequence. It would be pretty ideal to take a thematic sequence and turn it into a minor complementing my major, but I still feel like I want to take my thematic sequence in COM, and take a few PR classes, even though it's not offered as a minor. Ohhh college...</P>

"event","I went home friday with my friend Steph. Steph's mom picked us up and we drove to Middletown on our way home and went to Target, etc. So, we pass by this kinda big buidling with LOTS of nice cars in front, and everywhere. It said ""Hustler"" on the front. So I'm like, ""it's pretty funny that someone would name their car dealership ""Hustler."" But to my surprise, Steph's mom informed me that it was not a car dealership. Who would have guessed there's an actual Hustler store in Middletown? And it must get a lot of business, because there were a lot of cars in the lot :)"

"event","I had an accounting test today, I thought I did okay until the very end, then I fucked it up when I blanked on income statement and balance sheet stuff. At least I got the 5 points extra credit for going to that little ACC Job Seminar last Friday.
Then tomorrow I have an Econ quiz, CSA 141 test, which I'm for sure going too fuck up. Then Wednesday I have an Econ test. Lovely, huh?
After my test today my parents picked me up at the Business School and took me out to lunch/dinner. They had been in Cincy for the day, so that was really nice. I felt like i was in elementary school again.
Anna and I decided that we're going to Europe this summer with 2 other girls. I want to go to Italy (Rome, Venice) and France (Paris, and then the south of France, like Nice). We're doing this after our summer classes in August. I cant wait.
I also cannot wait until August because I just bought tickets to a Red Sox game for me and Nick, and I'm excited (understatement)to see him again. Hopefull by then I will have completed all my business core courses and admit into the Business School with a 3.0. 
I need to start studying for econ. and if anyone wants to explain what ""relative, mixed, absolute"" in Excel, I would appreciate it."

The worst though is that I have to take a drop form to my prof and have her sign it...I never know what to say. It's a little awkward, like ""hey, um, I need to drop your class, will you sign this for me?"" I made a friend in econ! I have to walk like 2727363 miles everyday...in ridiculous temperatures. I'm also being consumed by television. I only got about 4 channels last semester, and have never had cable, and for the first time in my life i do! I was watching Training Day at 2am this morning. And of course I watched American Idol tonight.
I think that's it for now.

I was up until 5am writing my speech, partially because my internet decided to randomly not work for like 2 hours last night.  I gave it in front of my class at 2pm.  I woke up at 10am, practiced the speech,then went to the computer lab to make my visual aid for my speech because my printer is broken and I still havent bothered to buy one because I can print stuff for free in Bachelor. Word. Then, I somehow managed to lock my keys inside my apartment. I had to push my window open from the outside and jump through it, and I looked like an ass to everyone walking by.  Then I got kinda scared that someone could easily push open my window and kill me while I'm sleeping. Now, I am insanely tired and want to take a nap. I do, however have 2 papers, a test, and a quiz next week. I should go to Starbucks and bust out a paper because this weekend is Mountain Dew, and my cousin Katie is coming down from Canton. I'll probably end up napping.
So yeah....have a good weekend kids. <3 jen"

~At OSU it takes 2, 1 to screw it in and 1 to  time it to make sure they did it faster than Michigan
~At OU it takes 5, 1 to bring the weed and 4 to smoke it while they all imagine they did it
~At BG it takes 0 b/c they are all too drunk from the night before to care whether or not the lights are on
~At Miami it takes 0 cuz everyone refuses to do it until they can find a J. Crew light bulb"

These were my favorite times in Boston last year. I loved how the lights of Fenway lit up Boston, I loved the Citgo sign and the ""Go Sox"" lights on the Pru, I loved watching kids tip over cars and the police lined streets, Com Ave after a Red Sox victory, and I secretly loved how Anna would embarrass me with her ""Yankees Suck"" cheers or by harrassing the many New Yorkers sporting Yankee apparel.

I'm putting in my two weeks notice at my job because I'm getting tired of the my ridiculous work schedules and having to leave college on the weekends and not drink/make friends. I was trying very hard to get along with my dad this weekend and then he made some lame comment suggesting that I have no business majoring in Public Relations and I wont be successful in it.

Well i guess thats all for my boring life. O yeah i started lifting weights again so hopefully i can keep it up so i can get my muscle back to how it was. Im also starting the new diet. Its called the Budweiser diet. Today all i ate all day was a plate of ribs and rice and beans with one tortilla so yeah. Well im out laterz for whoever really has time to read it bye.

"event","things have been getting better. i just feel so frustated. the person who i thought was my BEST friend, is just a crappy person. idk what happened cause we used to be the bestest friends ever! things were so perfect until we had this fight over something stupid (like always) and she became closer to this other girl. so, that sucked. things havent changed. lots of other peoples have told me shes a bitch now, and that i have changed in a good way.

im also confused...bOyS! haha!
but, i guess i am really happy =) now cause i have the best friends in the world!!!

on monday night i spent the night at kennas with sophie. we just saw the grudge and we were a little shaken up. we didnt talk to much about my problems because, i guess i was keeping them bottled up. but its okay, i didnt really wanna share it then. but, i am so FiCKLE!!! i cant make up my mind! i usually trust my friends to make the decsions for me, and they all say the same thing do this or just trust you heart. idk what my heart says. i feel one way, but i know some of my friends wouldnt approve of that. idk..."

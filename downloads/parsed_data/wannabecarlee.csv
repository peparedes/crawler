i think i'm gonna have me a cigarette before i have to go to class.. today is going to suck, i can already tell . i should get blazed, or something. 

as for my weekly goals: still having exercise everyday , and on some days do 2 times a day.
only drink water ( cut out those blasted diet mountain dews) 
stay away from sugar and bread even more.

"event","well, i figured since i don't use my livejournal account for jack shit anymore, i would transform it into my progress to "" getting fit"" or to ""being healthy. whatever you want to call it, i choose to tag it as "" my pursuit to happiness"". 

I should of thought to log all this nonsense when i first started my journey of escaping my physical cursed state, but i didn't. So here i am now. 

I will start with :
   I woke up today and the scale said i was a whopping 8 pounds heavier than i was from the DAY before. In a frantic/crazed state i raped google of its information about water retention/salt intakes and anything else under the face of the sun to explain this 8 fucking pound madness. I'm still in a discouraged state, and am wondering how long it might take to get out of this funk. It just feels like such a spit in the face! All this hard work for over 3 weeks now of exercising 6 days a week, and watching my calories like a nun goes to mass FOR THIS?!!?!? Absolutely discouraging and upseting. 

My body was starting to show progress for a small amount of time, but nothing big. nothing that just <i>anyone</i>would notice, of course. 

So if I had to sum up my feelings with all my VERY hard busting my ass work at the gym i must say ""  Trapped in Fat"". I feel like my destiny is this figure, and state of mind. Will it change? only time will tell. But I figured if i have gotten this far then giving up would be idiotic. So, tomorrow is monday, a new fresh day of a brand spankin' new week. 

current weight: 194 ( just about 9 pounds away from when i first started this whole nonsense)
lowest weight: 183
highest weight: 204"

i'm sorry that im not an alcoholic. 
i'm sorry that i have replaced almost all my free time with working, so i can have money to live at my"" home"". 
i'm sorry that i'm not as social as i use to be, and that i don't think being ""cool"" is cool anymore. 
i'm sorry i am me.
i hope everyone is having a wonderful time shit talking me.
i would talk to certain people about it in adult way if an adult response was going to be given.  but since i know that will never happen, i am forced to take the pathetic route of livejournal. 

i'm  probably moving away, and this time it is not my choice. maybe it will be good for me. who knows. who cares anymore. no one. i don't really expect them to either. 

the level of selfishness and the lack of empathy is fucking absurd.

"event","the update. 
done alot of thinking.

the biggest question that still seems to linger so annoyingly above my head is, "" should i stay or should i go ? "" 
i feel like if i go then i'm just running away in search for something i will find in every city. shit bags, drugs, and eager minds of relentlesness to be like everyone else. 
if i stay, then there is the strange chance that i might regret leaving. whose to know these days. 

i got one thing keeping me here, and i'm working hard with it. perhaps i should stick it out and make something from nothing. i'm doing a damn good job of that with the help of an amazing guitarist and banjo player. thanks fella's, you make my life worth living for about 3 hours a week. 

i wonder what people see when they look at me? 
i would love to know what label is tagged to my existance. 

the update as of today : 
i'm pretty sure i have fractured and or broken my arm . SWEET 
workers comp? seems like too much of a hassle. 

i got some figuring out to do, but until then i'm just going to keep laughing with my broken eyes. 

and if i didn't have to work so early tomorrow morning then i would go on a midnight train ride . by myself. i bet my shadow and the glow of a cigarette is beautiful from a distance."

hmph .. 
heres the situation: 
its currently 11:51 pm on a normal boringham friday night. some friends are out at the bar, and i am pondering the thought of actually going. i always have to work on saturday mornings at 7 am. should i stay in .. or should i go ? i usually stay in on nights like this so i wont be so tired the next day but for once i think i want to go out. but the more i sit here and think about it, the more i will talk myself out of going.  i just always feel like im missing out on something , if i dont go out.. o well . 

the show was good tonight, and i had alot of fun .. for once, in a kinda long time. 

on a different note.. i might get to go around squatting with my friend john .. hell yes. crusty punkin it up !!  cant wait to meet loads of cool people with the same values and ethics as I . we are few and far between and thats why this family is so cherished. 

well i just let out a big yawn .. so i think that means.. i just need to stay in for tonight.. its just another friday night, another night of going out to bar and watching everyones drunk asses stumble about the place."

someone just signed into msn , and i would really love to talk to them but i just cant. since when does he still get on ?!?! ugh , so tempting but i just cant. hes not a part of me anymore. 

i really enjoyed choir today for somereason , not that i normally dont enjoy it. it just seemed more together today than it normally does..  theres something that pisses me off. i miss what choir use to be. it grates on my nerves that the same mistakes have to be fixed over and over and over again . Dr Copeland sounds like afucking broken record. I dont like alot of peoples attitudes in there.. its kinda like. get your headout of your own ass, listen across the whole choir and your section , blend well and dont sound like your singing a fucking solo, have volume control, and god damnit!! this is a college choir, we shouldnt have to be going over VOWELS everyday .. get it together is what i say . but i think pretty much 80 % of the people in choir are frightened by me, so if i were to actually speak up i might scare them all off.. silly people.. im harmless. even Dr. Copeland knows that !! 


i can taste death on my tongue and fear on his lips. 
a shiver in the dark , while blood trickles down his neck. 
the smell of death in the air , and eternity in his eyes. 
i'll leave this knife in his hand as my allaby.
so solong sweet lad, i'm sorry we had to part
but when you mess with me, i'll have to rip out your heart.

number 1: i'm glad im finally getting the fuck away from here, even though sometimes i think about how it's going to be sad to leave. atleast when im gone i wont have to sit here and think about the ""what if's"" of finally escaping. 
number 2: if this god damned phone rings one more time, im going to bash it so hard in the wound already on my head and bleed myself fucking dry. 
number 3: i got really desperate today and posted a boyfriend application on myspace. no one fucking responded. jesus christ, what is wrong with me?!?! will someone just tell me already . being honest with myself is the only option a the moment. Im getting pretty desperate for aleast for someone tofucking notice me, not be my boyfriend even .. just to fucking look at me or maybe act like they are interested.
number 4: i am especially tired of the only guysEVER EVER EVER interested in me i nthe slightest bit are large black men. ( no i am not rascist) but <b> DO I LOOK LIKE A BOO?!!?!?!??!!?!? DO I FUCKING LOOK LIKE I WANT TO BE YO' SHAWTY?!?!?!!?!? </b> yeah i didnt fucking think so , so get fucked you pieces of shit. i wear all black , and wear bullet belts... in my opinion thats nothing close to FUBU.
number 5: i hate living with my parents.. not so much when i dont see them, but the days where me and my mother are in the same house all day . she gets highly irritating, i love her. but UHGH ! its like.. DONT YOU LEAVE ?!?!?! 
number 6: why cant i get hired anywhere?!?!?! another.. whats wrong with me?!!! my availability is anything, and i have lots of previous experience.. HELLO .. yeah go ahead, hire the person that alrady has 2 jobs and can only work 2 nights a week! YEAH , GOOOD CHOICE!  I DONT HAVE A JOB, im able to start ASAP. mmmmm holidays are up, hardly any money to buy people things, and bills to pay. maybe if i didnt consume most of my time with preparation to fuck off somewhere for a while, then maybe i would have money.
number 7: why do the holidays always have to make me so moody ?!?! isnt this the time when people are suppose to be happy, giving, and just.. HAPPY?!! not in my case. it makes me irritable. which then just makes me look like even more of an ass because the way i am during this time of year. way to go carlee, you're a fuck up with a bad attitude! WOOO who wants to be my friend?
number 8: i've gained weight. im an emotional eater, and a bored eater. because i cant get a job, im bored and it makes me depressed. therefore: i eat. my parents can't seem to comprehend the fact that im a VEGETARIAN .. its impossible in this house hold. i've never had a personal decision so violated. "" Carlee, we are having chicken tonight!!!!  "" me "" mom .. im vegetarian .. "" her: "" but chicken isnt red meat.. "" what .. the.. fuck ..  i really don't get it.. i would wikipedia Vegan and Vegetarian for her and print out the results, but then  i would only get yelled at for being such a ""smart ass"". 
number 9: if anyone knows how to get rid of these mood swings.. let me know. im suppose to be on meds for it, but i read that one of the main side effects of it is ; weight gain ... mm no thanks, id rather blow up every once in a while"

"event","the sun actually shining in norwich ?? whoa.. lets see how long this lasts 

bottom line is .. carlee, you and him dont get along... we don't.   we think two opposite ways and he cant handle the truth ... in anything. i demand too much of him as a person and i refuse to settle on someone like him. he just isnt really up to par to what i want him to be.. people just dont change.  .. no, nothing went bad. allthis being my decision .. we just arent going to work out...  it was all great until i just decided and made a move that would change us forever. so long laurence. ive finally decided to peace out of your life. i'll see you when i see you, and i hope you that one day you will really be happy.. in the mean time, happy searching and just be true to yourself, you will hurt alot less people in the end. 

all i have left to say is, the sun just went down and it just went dreary again .. and the famous amos line of ""you leave my heart soaking wet, boy your boots can leave a mess"" .


feckin ell mate ! 

i miss mary."

"event","had a mental break down with my mother today . no , not just some tears and trembled speach .. kicking , screaming, cursing, crying, fighting.   i have a serious problem and i finally got my mother to understand my fucked up view point. i start counseling tomorrow. 

i cant bruise or cut myself anylonger, i cant beat myself any more. it hurts too much. metaphorically and literally. 

i dont know what to do with myself anymore. im not even a person anymore, i'm a monster that is out to destroy the real me. carlee has been long gone, and the enemy has moved in. if i dont decide to fight it now, it will only defeat me for good. if i let it win, death is what will come of it. 

with all seriousness, your prayers and thoughts are much needed for this is a very, very difficult time for me. 

i will rise against it, and i will be carlee again one day. and im excited for people to really know me once again."

"event","what an eventful weekend

my car is completely cleaned out and sparkling with brilliance!! i slaved over that thing for 3 hours today detailing it inside and out. I like my car again now. 

friday - the usual . get semi-drunk, leave early because im not having that good of a time
saturday- the usual. get semi-drunk , stay way too late and am miserable by the time i roll into my driveway. 
sunday-recooperate from my lack of a good time on the weekend, and feel pretty shitty about the next 5 days of work ahead of me. 

<b> people REALLY bore me </b> thus why i occupy so much of my time being alone. 
another question i always ask myself . "" why am i such a fucking bitch?! "" ... my usual reply to myself to compensate for my actions .. "" eh, it's not that big of a deal, carlee "" 

i think this is the longest entry i have made in a while. hoorah .. 
i went to the dollar theater this evening, i enjoyed myself. 
time is ticking away and i still have yet to perfect my outward appearence. i dont think anyone truly understands the importance of my reasoning however, i don't really expect them to because i am the person you will never get the pleasure of figuring out :)

by the way, is the fair still open ??? spin roundy round rides sound quite splendid. 
BEEEDDLLE DEE !"

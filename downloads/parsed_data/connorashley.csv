It's hard to write about this.  Pregnancy is tedious and repetitious.  The same things happen every day -- the baby turns cartwheels, the baby shoves his feet up against my diaphragm, I get tired, I get cravings.  It's interesting to me every single time the baby moves, I'm constantly slamming my hand against my stomach as fast as humanly possible to ""catch"" the sensation of a body part moving independently under my skin, but in writing it's just... not that intriguing.  ""The baby moved.  The baby moved again.  The baby moved again.  The baby...""

New things come so rarely.  Four months of nothing much but exhaustion and then:  a flutter.  Then a month of flutter.  Then real kicks!  Then four and a half months or so of real kicks.  What do I say about the in between?  I didn't notice that I was showing at all until last weekend, and the only reason I noticed then was that every single person in Santa Fe felt the need to comment.  ""Oh, you're pregnant!  When's the baby due?  Are you pregnant?""  I had no idea, until that point I'd been feeling inadequate because I thought it wasn't noticeable at six months.  Being pregnant is like that; the whole experience is so elongated and oddly squashed at the same time that things escape your notice (until one day, oh! a belly).  It's a very gradual sort of rush.

Maybe part of the problem is that this is the world's most uninteresting pregnancy.  Nothing is happening.  I didn't get sick in the beginning, only tired.  I didn't get glowy and luscious with feel-good hormones and energy in the middle, only bigger.  In this last part, I don't seem to be getting excited and anxious and enormous, only hefty and constantly a little uncomfortable.  Still, we're in the home stretch now."

"event","We passed the halfway mark a week ago.  I thought hitting 20 weeks would be much more reassuring than it was, somehow -- I expected to feel some sort of <i>almost there</i> sensation.  Instead, I keep moaning about how there's twenty <i>more</i> weeks to go through.

Prenatal appointment today.  The heartbeat is galloping right along, and... that's about all we know.  I'm not sure what the point of these appointments is, except to make sure the baby's heart is still beating.  Aside from that priceless (and sort of obvious) bit of knowledge, I learned that I'm not feeling the baby move because I'm carrying really far back.  Oh, and the midwife prescribed Flexeril to relieve some of the stress from my back.  This is partly to alleviate pain and partly to force my back muscles to relax so that they won't choke off my spinal cord as the baby grows.

Hooray for pre-existing conditions.

Ultrasound on January 11th.  It's going to be one of these fancy 4D things and I'm supposed to bring a blank videocassette.  Somehow, I think I'll skip making a video entitled <i>Look, Guys!  It's My Uterus!</i>  It'll be nice to know the sex, though."

[To those of you who have both this journal and <lj user=""sarawr""> on your friends lists, I apologize for the cross-posting.]

I had a brief prenatal appointment today wherein the midwife listened to the baby's heartbeat for about nine seconds (man, that fucker is galloping along), prodded at my tummy, and pronounced everything ""fine."" I must have looked as if I wanted more information, because after the ""fine"" proclamation she looked at my face, sighed, and said, ""The baby is definitely growing normally -- in fact, it seems to be a little larger than usual. The heartbeat is chugging right along and I obviously had no trouble finding it. You've gained eight pounds since the pregnancy began, which is excellent. Your uterus has risen to exactly where it should have. Everything really is fine.""

So why haven't I felt it move? Because I probably won't for another three or four weeks, that's why. All the crap I've read about feeling it at 17 or 18 weeks has been just that -- crap. Sigh.

Three more weeks might drive me 'round the very last bend."

I am so bored all the time.  All there is to do in this half-horse town is drink, and I obviously can't do that.  So I'm bored.  All the time.  And it's horrible.

And my friends tonight are going out to do actual things, things which we do not do every night -- or even every month or every six months -- with some other people who seem kind of cool.  And guess who didn't even get invited?  That's right.  Because I'm pregnant.  Nevermind that these activities only involve alcohol in the most peripheral sense, and I could easily <i>not drink</i>.  Nevermind that if anyone does drink, they'll need a DD.  Hell, even nevermind the fact that everyone knows I am <i>bored off my goddamn ass</i> and desperately need out of my mother's house.  I'm not invited.

And this weekend?  They're going to Lubbock.  Again, I'm not invited.  Because I'm pregnant, and apparently pregnant ladies don't appreciate big malls, good food, or gay clubs.  Furthermore, when I expressed an interest, I got a brief dodge and then, ""Bye, we're leaving.""  Implied subtext:  <i>Without you, you boring party pooper.</i>

The upshot is, I sat here planning a solo trip to Lubbock to salve my pride, and just as I was picturing a nice fruity drink at the nice fruity club, I glanced down and caught sight of my prenatal vitamins.  Implied subtext:  <i>This is your life, you boring party pooper.</i>

I'm probably going to cry, because of the hormones and the abandonment and the sheer fucking boredom."

This pregnancy is starting to fuck with my head.  I am stressed out about absolutely everything, and I know part of it's gotta be hormones.  The other part is reality.

Fuck.

The thing is, I am broke.  Really broke.  The money I'd assiduously saved up for this move is gone, the little bit of money that came in a few days ago is gone.  My school decided last week that I can't attend anymore, leaving me stranded mid-semester without enough time to find a job and earn a living wage before next month's rent and bills are due.  My bank made the decision that I should pay them $300 at the same time the school made their decision.  All of this adds up to a budget that is shot to shit and a desperately needy pregnant lady.

I have a soon-to-be roommate that I can't just flake out on.  I have a baby I can't just flake out on.  I can't stay in my mother's house indefinitely, swelling like a goddamn mare with dropsy and working some crappy part-time job to have a little spending cash.  I am absolutely terrified about the fairly immediate future, mostly because none of this seems fair at all.  I had money saved.  I have a boyfriend who, in theory, is here to help me through this pregnancy.  I shouldn't be so stuck -- I'm fucking pregnant.  I should get to kick back a little and enjoy (or at least survive intact) the whole process.  I shouldn't be becoming more frantic by the day, trying to figure out how to work two part-time jobs or one full-time job plus some babysitting just to... not be stuck.

I don't want to be that needy girlfriend who uses a pregnancy to get what she wants, but I keep wanting to yell at Michael.  I keep wanting to ask him to step up to the fucking plate and <i>help</i> me with this stuff, but he can't and I keep my mouth shut.  He's struggling just to stay in the most basic of classes at school; how is he going to hold any sort of worthwhile job?  And what could he do with the sort of job he's qualified for, anyway -- buy diapers once a month?  

It's not like he doesn't help.  He carries heavy things for me when he's around and he goes with me to my doctor's appointments.  The problem is, that stuff isn't actually very helpful.  Not that I'm complaining, exactly, it's just... I am so scared.  None of my pants fit and I'm always eating things and I don't even know how I'll pay rent and have electricity, much less come up with extra money for things like maternity clothes and winter shoes and baby things.  Much less come up with even more extra money to have some semblance of a life so that I don't go insane.  

I want to be the weakling and shove all this off on someone else's shoulders, and poor Michael seems to be the logical choice.  Half the time I want to scream at him to grow the fuck up and take <i>care</i> of me, goddamnit.  And that's just not fair when he's doing his absolutely sweet, caring, gentle best to be by my side."

So, I think the insanity has finally begun.

I've been reading pregnancy blogs and staring with alternate horror and giddiness at pregnancy.about.com's belly gallery and then staring with alternate horror and giddiness at my <i>own</i> belly... and it's all finally catching up with me.

I really, really want to feel the baby move.  I really want to be at the point where my belly is definitively a Pregnant Belly and not just a few extra pounds.  I want to feel like a carrier of life, rather than normal with a side of fat.  Apparently, this baby has other plans.  Apparently, it is a tiny, tiny baby who likes to lie very still and watch its own toes form.  At 15 weeks and three days, I feel that this is unacceptable.  Sometime late last night, as I was lying in bed poking and massaging my stomach in some strange attempt to feel the baby, I decided to start calorie-loading.  

See, up until now, I've been eating pretty normally -- more than I usually do, but still only about 1700 calories a day.  According to my midwife, I'm supposed to be eating between 2100 and 2500 calories per day -- between 300 and 500 extra calories, in other words.  She told me that I would start being hungry enough to eat that much naturally, but I don't think she realized that a normal day of eating in my world is about 1400 calories.  Sure, I'm hungrier than before I got pregnant, but hungry enough to eat 2500 calories per day?  No.

Hence the calorie-loading.  I decided, in some weird logic twist, that the reason I have this tiny, immobile baby is that it's not getting enough nourishment.  The more I eat, the bigger and more active that baby gets, right?  

<i>Right?!?!?!</i>

I know that eating five hotdogs plus a 16-ounce glass of full-fat milk plus some cheese plus a tomato plus a bell pepper plus some ice cream for lunch will not really force the baby's development.  Shut up, don't tell me, <i>I know</i>.  Still, it makes me feel like I'm doing something.  Some women don't feel the baby move until as late as the 21st week; I know that too.  Some women don't start showing <i>at all</i> until their fifth month.  I know!  And I also know that as soon as I am huge and swollen and receiving a regular internal beating at the hands of my child's feet (... heh), I will want it to go away.  I know, I know, I know.

And I don't care.  Grow, baby, grow!  Tango, backflip, do handsprings!  Get a <i>life</i> already.

(It's gotta be the hormones.)"

I'm tired of being pregnant.  I know, I know, I'm not even halfway through this yet.  I know.  But the thing is?  I'm sick of sleeping all the time.  I'm sick of eating weird things.  I'm sick of eating a <i>whole lot</i> of normal things.  I'm sick of everyone feeling they have the right to invade my personal space to ""feel the baby.""  I'm sick of having to pee every time I turn around. I'm sick of watching my stomach swell. 

I think the problem is that I don't particularly feel pregnant.  I don't feel life in there.  The baby's still too small for movements to be noticeable, and I've only just started showing -- and what I'm showing doesn't look so much like a pregnancy as an extra <strike>five</strike> ten pounds around the waist.  I had this nice few days after the ultrasound where I actually sort of felt pregnant; I could visualize the little sea monkey wriggling around in there, and I <i>felt</i> that it existed and was growing and moving and all that nice stuff.  It's pretty hard to hold on to that sort of stuff when you can't see or feel what's going on inside, though.

In summation, I'm annoyed.  I wish it was January already so that I could go to my next ultrasound and so that I'll be pregnant enough to feel it.  I wish it was May already so that I could be done with giving birth and have a visible baby with whom to connect.  These first few months are <i>so tedious</i>.

(I may be the worst expectant mother ever.)

On the other hand, I've been writing in the baby books like mad.  I don't know yet whether it's a boy or a girl, so I write in both books -- write and write and write.  The books are cutesy, with pages for things like ""how your dad and I first met"" and ""how I felt when I found out about you.""  I figure I'd better tell these stories now, before the baby spends most of its life being too young to care or too old to listen.  (Dear baby, I'm sorry I talk so much. Love, Mommy.)

I just wish I could make a connection."

The ultrasound went... as an ultrasound does, I guess.  The baby exists, it strongly resembles television snow, etc.  My due date was slightly adjusted, and hey, who knew that a baby's heart would beat?  Apparently I didn't, because everyone in the doctor's office made a huge deal out of the fact that the heart was beating.

""Do you see that?  That's a digital readout of YOUR BABY'S HEARTBEAT.  That means that THE HEART IS BEATING.  And here's some earphones so that you can HEAR THE HEARTBEAT.  There is a baby in there, and ITS HEART IS BEATING.""

I wanted to kill the entire world by the time I got out of the doctor's office.

Here's an adjusted due-date meter:

I want to update this thing more, but there's nothing newsworthy going on yet.  I don't want to be one of those expectant mothers who documents every single craving obsessively and makes charts of her urine output to tell how close the baby is to her bladder.  I mean, y'all don't need to know that when I lay flat I can see a little bump in my stomach that (I think) is the baby.  You don't need to hear about how all I ever want to eat anymore are waffles and pasta.  You don't need to know that the first time I took my new prenatal vitamins I puked, and it's not particularly interesting that the pharmacy offered me childproof caps for my <i>unborn child</i>.

You especially don't need to know about the stretch marks where my already wide hips are widening, or the fact that my mother informed me last night that I'm ""expanding.""  I'm roughly ten weeks pregnant, and none of this is intriguing.

I guess you just read about it all anyway, though, because I have no self-control.  Sorry.  :P"

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a due-date meter.  It's in the info if you must keep obsessive track.

Also, does anyone want to design a baby-themed, sage green layout for this place?"

"event","I have had the best weekend EVER!! I went to the Wreckers concert featuring Tyler Hilton on thursday! Holyyy shit it was unbelivable.  First my sis came and picked me up from lax tryouts where I found out i made the team (yay!) and we had to rush to Foxwoods for the show (i felt so gross for not showering!) Then we got seated in the tenth row which wasn't thaty bad of sweets but i sooo wanted to get closer and we watched Tyler hilton from there and he was amazing, he sounded better than he does on his cD and he is sooo hott! in pictures and stuff i always thought he was kinda ugly but holy shit in person he is like WHOA!! and then kelsey and jackie were there and they were in the 2nd row so during intermission we went and saw them and they were like you can come up with us so their moms gave us there seats which was sooooooooo increadibly nice of them and then the rest of the show was amazing!!! Michelle Branch and Jessica were sooooo good and i was really worried I wouldn;t like them but they were unbelievable and i am soo buying there CD now!  Then Cara and I went to the buffet, holy shit there was soooo muhc food i thought i was going crazy..i couldn;t decide at all.  We decided that were going to go to foxwoods a lot more just so we can eat at the buffet! haha....then last night i went to brits and we went to Walmart and played hide and seek!! greatest shiiiittt ever we were soo freaking hyper hahah! good times!  and then we bouhgt a ton of candy for like no money cuz walmart is cheap and wentr to the moveis to see Guess Who? which was increadibly funny and definitly worth seeing.  Other than that, I bought jeans which i am really excited about becuz all my other ones have holes in them and im unable to wear them.  I'm finally gonna be able to hang out with chris tomarrow!  Can;t wAIT!! me and my sister are gonna go do some yoga with the hott mats that we jsut bought that we are taking with us to florida so we can do yoga by the pool and watch it on her laptop! hah we are such loozers!

"event","TOday was a very very bad day...i woke up with a horrrible stomach ache and i felt like a was about to puke, so i took some pepto bismol but that didn;t help at all.  Then cara and i get locked out of our house with the car keys in the house cuz she thought i grabbed them and i thoguth she did so we had to call my aunt to bring us a key and therefore were late to school..my stomach only got worse as i had to look at pictures of fetus in fetu during speech for my project, then my biology lab report was a disaster as i spent my whole lunch in the library doing it wrong!  So, i ate a banana all day cuz my stomach continued to get worse and stilll feel kinda nautious (sp).  I think i need to go to bed!

It definitly ruined my day!  Bessides that i officially went broke today when I spent my last $40, and now i'm doing anything for cash including feeding my aunts birds while shes on vacation which is soo gross and scary cuz whenever i stick my hand in the cage i feel like there gonna attack me!  It sCAry!!  So Cara and I went to Fashion Imports downtown to get purses cuz we got gift certificates there for Christmas...I was not impressed at all.  It was really expensive for the stuff that they had cuz it wasnt that nice.  I jsut got a pair of diamond studded earrings cuz i needed studs and wanted to used the money from the gc.  Then we went to Marshalls to try for better luck and they had a TOn of stuff it was soo hard to choose.  I finally found this cute blue Nine West bag to use for a book bag cuz my other one is like falling apart and has writing all over it from Kevin in Bio.  I also got Tommy Hilfiger sunglasses and cara got a pair of sunglasses too and on the way home she was making fun of us saying how we thought we were so ""cool"" for wearing our new sunglasses when really I bought them cuz i'm tired of squinting.  Shes sucha dork haha!  But after that shopping experience I am officially broke besides the $40 I counted in change that I'm bringing to Coin Star in Shop and Shop tomarrow!!YEssss I love that thing!  I made like 75 bucks once, it was crazy!  But, now im gonna go finish reading my book for english, fun stuff!  Lata...

The subject was what Heaven was like. 'I wowed 'em,' he later told his father, Bruce. 'It's a killer. It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote..' It also was the last. <br />&nbsp;<br />Brian Moore died May 27, 1997, the day after Memorial Day. He was driving home from a friend's house when his car went off Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway County and struck a utility pole. He emerged from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line and was electrocuted. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Moores framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among the family portraits in the living room. 'I think God used him to make a point. I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it,' Mrs. Moore said of the essay. She and her husband want to share their son's vision of life after death. 'I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see him.' <br />&nbsp;<br />Brian's Essay: The Room... <br />In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room. There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with small index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction, had very different headings. As I drew near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention was one that read 'Girls I have liked.' I opened it and began flipping through the cards. I quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized the names written on each one.. And then without being told, I knew exactly where I was. <br />&nbsp;<br />This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my life. Here were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, in a detail my memory couldn't match. A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and exploring their content. Some brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if anyone was watching. <br />&nbsp;<br />A file named 'Friends' was next to one marked 'Friends I have betrayed.' The titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird 'Books I Have Read,' 'Lies I Have Told,' 'Comfort I have Given,' 'Jokes I Have Laughed at .' Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: 'Things I've yelled at my brothers.' Others I couldn't laugh at: 'Things I Have Done in My Anger', 'Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents..' I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. <br />&nbsp;<br />Often there were many more cards than I expected. Sometimes fewer than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. Could it be possible that I had the time in my years to fill each of these thousands or even millions of cards? But each card confirmed this truth. Each was written in my own handwriting. Each signed with my signature. <br />&nbsp;<br />When I pulled out the file marked 'TV Shows I have watched', I realized the files grew to contain their contents. The cards were packed tightly, and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found the end of the file. I shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of shows but more by the vast time I knew that file represented. <br />&nbsp;<br />When I came to a file marked 'Lustful Thoughts,' I felt a chill run through my body. I pulled the file out only an inch, not willing to test its size and drew out a card. I shuddered at its detailed content. <br />&nbsp;<br />I felt sick to think that such a moment had been recorded. An almost animal rage broke on me. One thought dominated my mind: No one must ever see these cards! No one must ever see this room! I have to destroy them!' In insane frenzy I yanked the file out. Its size didn't matter now. I had to empty it and burn the cards. But as I took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, I could not dislodge a single card. I became desperate and pulled out a card, only to find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it. <br />&nbsp;<br />Defeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. Leaning my forehead against the wall, I let out a long, self-pitying sigh. <br />&nbsp;<br />And then I saw it.. The title bore 'People I Have Shared the Gospel With.' The handle was brighter than those around it,seemed newer, almost unused. I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my hands. I could count the cards it contained on one hand. <br />&nbsp;<br />And then the tears came. I began to weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt. They started in my stomach and shook through me. I fell on my knees and cried. I cried out of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all. The rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. No one must ever, ever know of this room. I must lock it up and hide the key. But then as I pushed away the tears, I saw Him. <br />&nbsp;<br />No, please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. I couldn't bear to watch His response. And in the moments I could bring myself to look at His face, I saw a sorrow deeper than my own. <br />&nbsp;<br />He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes. Why did He have to read every one? Finally He turned and looked at me from across the room. He looked at me with pity in His eyes. But this was a pity that didn't anger me. I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry again. He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have said so many things. But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me. <br />&nbsp;<br />Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files. Starting at one end of the room, He took out a file and, one by one, began to sign His name over mine on each card. 'No!' I shouted rushing to Him. All I could find to say was 'No, no,' as I pulled the card from Him. His name shouldn't be on these cards. But there it was, written in red so rich, so dark, so alive. The name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with His blood. He gently took the card back. He smiled a sad smile and began to sign the cards. I don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but the next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file and walk back to my side. <br />&nbsp;<br />He placed His hand on my shoulder and said, 'It is finished.' I stood up, and He led me out of the room. There was no lock on its door. There were still cards to be written. <br />&nbsp;<br />'I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.'-Phil. 4:13 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.' If you feel the same way forward it so the love of Jesus will touch their lives also My 'People I shared the gospel with' file just got bigger, how about yours? <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","Qw may all think "" I don't have time for this... And, this is really inappropriate during work.<br />Then, I realized that this kind of thinking is... Exactly, what has caused lot of the problems in our world today.<br />We try to keep God in church on Sunday morning..<br />Maybe, Sunday night...<br />And, the unlikely event of a midweek service.<br /><br />We do like to have Him around during sickness..<br />And, of course, at funerals.<br />However, we don't have time, or room, for Him during work or play...<br />Because.. That's the part of our lives we think... We can, and should, handle on our own.<br /><br />May God forgive me for ever thinking<br />That... there is a time or place where..<br />HE is not to be FIRST in my life.<br /><br />We should always have time to remember all HE has done for us.<br /><br />Jesus said, 'If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my Father.'<br /><br />Yes, I do Love God.<br />HE is my source of existence and Savior.<br />He keeps me functioning each and every day. Without Him, I will be nothing. But, with Christ, HE strengthens me. (Phil 4:13)<br /><br />This is the simplest test.<br />If You Love God... And, are not ashamed of all the marvelous things HE has done for you...<br />Spread this around!<br /><br />&nbsp;I don't think I know 10 people who would admit they love Jesus. Do You love Him?<br /><br /><strong><u><font size=""4"">THE POEM</font></u></strong><br />I knelt to pray but not for long, I had too much to do. I had to hurry and get to work For bills would soon be due.&nbsp;<br />So I knelt and said a hurried prayer, and jumped up off my knees.<br />My Christian duty was now done<br />My soul could rest at ease.<br /><br />All day long I had no time<br />To spread a word of cheer. No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br />They'd laugh at me I'd fear.<br /><br />No time, no time, too much to do,<br />That was my constant cry,<br />No time to give to souls in need<br />But at last the time, the time to die.<br /><br />I went before the Lord, I came, I stood with downcast eyes. For in his hands God held a book; It was the book of life.<br />God looked into his book and said<br />'Your name I cannot find.<br />&nbsp;I once was going to write it down...<br />But never found the time'<br /><br />Now do you have the time to pass it on?<br />Make sure that you scroll through to the end.<br /><br /><strong><u><font size=""4"">Easy vs. Hard<br /></font></u></strong>1.&nbsp;Why is it so hard to tell the truth but Yet so easy to tell a lie?<br />2. Why are we so sleepy in church but Right when the sermon is over we suddenly wake up?<br />3. Why is it so hard to talk about God but yet so easy to talk about nasty stuff?<br />4.&nbsp;Why is it so boring to look at a Christian magazine, but yet so easy to look at a nasty one?<br />5.&nbsp;Why is it so easy to delete a Godly e- mail, but yet we forward all of the nasty ones?<br />6.&nbsp;Why are the churches getting smaller but yet the bars and dance clubs are getting larger?<br /><br />Do you give up? Think about it . Are you going to forward this, or delete it?<br />Just remember-God is watching you.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><u><font size=""4"">Prayer Wheel-</font></u></strong><br />Let's see the devil stop this one!<br /><br />Here's what the wheel is all about. When you read this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to you....<br />That's all you have to do....<br />There is nothing attached....<br />This is so powerful....<br /><br />Do not stop the wheel, please....<br />Of all the free gifts we may receive, Prayer is the very best one....<br />There are no costs, but wonderful rewards... GOD BLESS!<br /><br />May God keep you and bless you. If this doesn't give you chills, nothing will...this message is very true. Hope you are all as blessed as I was from this story. I wonder how many people will delete this without reading it because of the title on it?<br /><br />There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in a small New England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to the Church carrying a rusty, bent, old bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. Eyebrows were raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak...'I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy coming toward me swinging this bird cage. On the bottom of the cage were three little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and asked, 'What you got there, son?' 'Just some old birds,' came the reply.<br /><br />'What are you gonna do with them?' I asked.<br /><br />'Take 'em home and have fun with 'em,' he answered 'I'm gonna tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a real good time' 'But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What will you do?'<br /><br />'Oh, I got some cats,' said the little boy. 'They like birds. I'll take 'em to them.'<br /><br />The pastor was silent for a moment. 'How much do you want for those birds, son?'<br /><br />'Huh?? !!! Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just plain old field birds. They don't sing. They ain't even pretty!'<br />'How much?' the pastor asked again.<br />The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, '$10?'<br /><br />The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten dollar bill. He placed it in the boy's hand. In a flash, the boy was gone.<br /><br />The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot Setting the cage down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars persuaded the birds out, setting them free.<br /><br />Well, that explained the empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the pastor began to tell this story.<br /><br />One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. 'Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!'<br /><br />'What are you going to do with them?' Jesus asked.<br /><br />Satan replied, 'Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!'<br /><br />'And what will you do when you get done with them?' Jesus asked. 'Oh, I'll kill 'em,' Satan glared proudly. 'How much do you want for them?' Jesus asked<br /><br />''Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill you. You don't want those people!!'<br /><br />'How much?' He asked again.<br /><br />Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, 'All your blood, tears and your life.'<br /><br />Jesus said, 'DONE!'<br /><br />Then He paid the price.<br /><br />The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and he walked from the pulpit.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-<br /><br />God has done so much for us, it is time we reciprocate the loveeeee!<br /><br />CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT! :D"

"event","<p>Dear Friends &amp; Family,<br />I think this is good reading for the soul.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />HERE IS SOMETHING WORTH SHARING WITH PEOPLE YOU CARE!! </p><p><br />One day a teacher asked her students to list the names of the other students in the room&nbsp;<br />on two sheets of paper, leaving a space between each name. <br />&nbsp; <br />Then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />It took the remainder of the class period to finish their assignment, and as the students left the room, each one handed in the papers.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper,&nbsp;<br />and listed what everyone else had said about that individual. </p><p>On Monday she gave each student his or her list. Before long, the entire class was smiling.&nbsp;<br />'Really?' she heard whispered. 'I never knew that I meant anything to anyone!' and,<br />&nbsp;'I didn't know others liked me so much,' were most of the comments. </p><p>No one ever mentioned those papers in class again. She never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents, but it didn't matter. The exercise had accomplished its purpose. The students were happy with themselves and one another.&nbsp;<br />That group of students moved on.&nbsp;<br /><br />Several years later, one of the students was killed in Viet Nam and his teacher attended&nbsp;<br />the funeral of that special student. She had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before.&nbsp;<br />He looked so handsome, so mature.&nbsp;<br /><br />The church was packed with his friends. One by one those who loved him&nbsp;<br />took a last walk by the coffin. The teacher was the last one to bless the coffin. </p><p>As she stood there, one of the soldiers who acted as pallbearer came up to her.<br />&nbsp;'Were you Mark's math teacher?' he asked. She nodded: 'yes.' Then he said: 'Mark talked about you a lot.'&nbsp;<br /><br />After the funeral, most of Mark's former classmates went together to a luncheon.&nbsp;<br />Mark's mother and father were there, obviously waiting to speak with his teacher. </p><p><br />'We want to show you something,' his father said, taking a wallet out of his pocket&nbsp;<br />'They found this on Mark when he was killed. We thought you might recognize it.' </p><p>Opening the billfold, he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times. The teacher knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which she had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him. </p><p>'Thank you so much for doing that,' Mark's mother said. 'As you can see, Mark treasured it.' </p><p>All of Mark's former classmates started to gather around. Charlie smiled rather&nbsp;<br />sheepishly and said, 'I still have my list. It's in the top drawer of my desk at home.' </p><p>Chuck's wife said, 'Chuck asked me to put his in our wedding album.'<br /><br />'I have mine too,' Marilyn said. 'It's in my diary' </p><p>Then Vicki, another classmate, reached into her pocketbook, took out her wallet and showed her worn and frazzled list to the group. 'I carry this with me at all times,' Vicki said and without batting an eyelash, she continued: 'I think we all saved our lists' </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's when the teacher finally sat down and cried. She cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again.<br /><br />The density of people in society is so thick that we forget that life will end one day. And we don't know when that one day will be. </p><p>So please, tell the people you love and care for, that they are special and important. Tell them, before it is too late.&nbsp;<br />-</p>"

"event","<p>A LETTER FROM JESUS <br /><br />Dear All, <br /><br />As you well know, we are getting closer to My birthday. <br />Every year there is a celebration in my honor <br />and I think that this year the celebration will be repeated. <br />During this time there are many people shopping for gifts, <br />there are many Radio announcements, <br />TV commercials, and in every part of the world everyone is talking that My birthday is getting closer and closer. <br />It is really very nice to know, that at least once a year, <br />some people think of Me. <br /><br />As you know, the celebration of My birthday began many years ago. <br />At first people seemed to understand and be thankful of all that I did for them, <br />but in these times, no one seems to know the reason for the celebration. <br />Family and friends get together and have a lot of fun, <br />but they don't know the meaning of the celebration. <br />I remember that last year there was a great feast in My honor. <br />The dinner table was full of delicious foods, pastries, fruits, assorted nuts and chocolates. <br />The decorations were exquisite and there were many, <br />many beautifully wrapped gifts. <br /><br />However, do you want to know something? <br />I was not invited. I was the guest of honor and they didn't remember to send me an invitation. <br />The party was for me, but when that great day came, <br />I was left outside, they closed the door in my face .. <br />and I wanted to be with them and share their table. <br />In truth, that didn't surprise me because in the last few years all close their doors to me. Since I wasn't invited, I decided to enter the party without making any noise. <br />I went in and stood in a corner. <br />They were all drinking; there were some who were drunk and telling jokes and laughing at everything. <br />They were having a grand time. <br /><br />To top it all, this big fat man all dressed in red wearing a long white beard entered the room yelling Ho-Ho-Ho! <br />He seemed drunk. <br />He sat on the sofa and all the children ran to him, saying: ""Santa Claus, Santa Claus"" as if the party were in his honor! <br />At midnight all the people began to hug each other; <br />I extended my arms waiting for someone to hug Me <br />and do you know no-one hugged Me. <br />Suddenly they all began to share gifts. <br />They opened them one by one with great expectation. <br />When all had been opened, I looked to see if, maybe, there was one for Me. <br />What would you feel if on your birthday everybody shared gifts and you did not get one? <br /><br />I then understood that I was unwanted at that party and quietly left. Every year it gets worse. <br />People only remember the gifts, the parties, to eat and drink, and nobody remembers Me. <br />I would like this Christmas that you allow Me to enter into your life. <br />I would like that you recognize the fact that almost two thousand years ago I came to this world to give My life for you, on the cross, to save you. <br /><br />Today, I only want that you believe this with all your heart. <br />I want to share something with you. <br />As many didn't invite me to their party, <br />I will have my own celebration, <br />a grandiose party that no one has ever imagined, a spectacular party. <br />I'm still making the final arrangements. <br /><br />Today I am sending out many invitations and there is an invitation for you. <br />I want to know if you wish to attend and I will make a reservation for you and write your name with golden letters in my great guest book. <br />Only those on the guest list will be invited to the party. <br />Those who don't answer the invite, <br />will be left outside. <br />Be prepared because when all is ready you will be PART of MY GREAT PARTY. <br />See you soon. <br /><br />I Love you! <br />Jesus <br /><br />(Christmas 2007) how will you spent this year's Christmas?</p>"

Send them to amusement parks, sporting events, plays, concerts, and movies instead.' </p><p>'Keep them busy, busy, busy!' </p><p>'And when they meet for spiritual fellowship, involve them in gossip and small talk so that they leave with troubled consciences.' </p><p>'Crowd their lives with so many good causes they have no time to seek power from Jesus.' </p><p>'Soon they will be working in their own strength, sacrificing their health and family for the good of the cause.' </p><p>'It will work!' </p><p>'It will work!' </p><p>It was quite a plan! </p><p>The demons went eagerly to their assignments causing Christians everywhere to get busier and more rushed, going here and there. </p><p>Having little time for their God or their families. </p><p>Having no time to tell others about the power of Jesus to change lives. </p><p>I guess the question is, has the devil been successful in his schemes? </p><p>You be the judge!!!!! </p><p>Does 'BUSY' mean: B-eing U-nder&nbsp;S-atan's Y-oke? </p>"

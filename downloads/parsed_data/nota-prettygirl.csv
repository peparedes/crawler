I just saw the most ridiculous thing on the news.
Christian missionaries going to Iraq!
Commentary before story : (and Im paraphrasing here)  While relief is being sent to the iraqi people to save them from hunger and disease, another form of help is going to save their souls.
Their purpose? To show the iraqis that there is another way to God!
Gee, like that's a huge fucking surprise.
Since when were Christians so similar to Jahovas witnesses? - knocking on doors trying to sell people onto a different religion?
Even better, why not go to a war riden country, where people are in unstable conditions, and try to plant doubt in their minds about the religion they follow!
And people are trying to tell us that they are not interested in changing Iraq into a more westernized/christian country? 
I started ranting about this to my father, and he told me I have a ""biased interest"", basically saying that my opinion was irrelevant since I'm interested in Islam. 
That pissed me off.
So, just because I'm on the opposing side to him in a debate, my opinion is irrelevant.
Bah"

My feet were where my head should have been. I wish my phone reached the other side of my bed, but c'est la vie. When people call you insistantly through the night, that's the price I gotta pay. Fuckers
Anywho, I have a 2500 word feature due on tuesday
I've written about 700 words..... ha
I also gotta work on a service article.. three photography assignments... a layout project.... and a 1500 word review.
I just gotta keep reminding myself.... 2 more weeks and it's all over... 
*sigh*
I'm seriously gonna need a vacation after this"

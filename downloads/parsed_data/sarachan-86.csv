"event","this is for everyone, put yourself in my position for a paragraph or 2,ok?  
 i have a question for anyone reading this, it might seem naive, but i just dont know some things, or i just want to make sure that what im thinking isnt completely wrong, the question is at the end of the paragraph. say you have known someone for 8 years, they all of the sudden disappear on you for about 3 years, then you run into to them accidently at a hookah bar, which is the last place you would ever expect to see them. thats espically when you thought you would never see them again in your life. oh, something i forgot to mention is the 3 yrs. ago when you knew them, you were falling heals over head for them, and they seemed like the were resipicating the same feelings. and then when they dissapeared, you just thought it was because you did something wrong, so for 3 years you sit there every single day trying to think back on every single moment you had with this person unable to think of any moment that was sour. it was all good, then when you see them at the bar, you lock eyes and just stand there thinking wtf for a breif moment, the felling of wanting to turn around and run, but you cant because his eyes have got you so hooked you cant look away, so then you can only do one thing,  you go up to them and give them this big hug and dont let them go the rest of the night. ok, they finally say the words you have been waiting for 8 years to hear, so, of course, you go out with them, and everythings good for a couple of months, it couldnt be better, you have waited for this for so long. so, towards about 5-6 months into the relationship things start to take that turn, the one where you want to know what happens next. and then, like so many times before with other relationships, they tell you that they need to take a break, you feel like you want to go jump off a building without the bungee cord. just when you thought that this time it would be different. they tell you that the just need time to get ""shit done."" that dosent make the knife in your chest hurt less. 
    i feel like giving up soooo bad, but theres that little thing in our minds that wont let us, i wish it werent there, so my actual question is: can anyone help me on this? PLEASE i dont know how to do this by myself, i need someone to tell me how to deal. he currently dosent even try to call, he say hes out looking for jobs, but i dont think that tells me much. he never tells whats going on."

"event","will he ever see me as more than a friend? i love him so much that when i think about him, i cringe. i am contiplating whether i should talk to him or not, it feels like i should just to clear a few things up. will he ever love me? or do i give up hope? i dont even know if what i feel is actually true love, or just a faze. he used to love me, i know that much, but i dont know if he still does or not. will i ever find anyone who loves me just as much as i love them if he dosent? will i ever have someone give me there heart completly, without hesetation? or will i be a lost soul crying out for someone and getting no response from anyone? this is what will happen for the rest of my life, i know it. 
            i have to say, even to this day, i still feel this way, even though my boyfriend loves me. ttfn"

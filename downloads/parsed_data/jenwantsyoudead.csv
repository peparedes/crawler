"event","Okay so the Dissinagrace show was on Friday, and it was by far amazing.. I am not going to rewrite everything about the show again because I have already written it in my myspace blog. So when I get home from school today I will copy it into here, since I can no longer get on myspace while I am at school, because of the stupid little 10 year olds making myspace accounts.


I also think I will be leaving livejournal and making a xanga instead. I don't even think anyone reads this journal anyways so it won't make much of a difference.


Well thats all I really have to say for now, I will post about the show  when I get on the computer tonight. I took some pictures as well and I have an open photobucket for them. So I will leave the link for that as well."

"event","ok so the Circa Survive, Saves the Day, Moneen, and the down to earth approach show was thursday.
it was amazing
for real, not even an exaggeration.


Joseph and Mike came and picked me up around 6 and we headed up to HOB. they were talking and I was texting robin for the most part of the ride up there, we listened to some amazing music of course, and then Joseph made us listen to Dissinagrace haha, cause he was thinking it sounded like shit on a system, so we had to assure him that it wasn't..apparently he had already made mike do that once before they came to get me. Joseph wouldn't let me take any before or after pictures of him getting trashed that night, which made me sad. 

so when we got up to the hob we were looking for a spot to park on the street hahaha, we went like forever down the street and we all said fuck that, we aren't going to walk that far. So we went to a parking garage that was close by. so we went into the restaraunt and went through to the back so we could just go in, but i didnt have a ticket so we had to go back out and around to the front so i could buy my ticket. Luckily there wasn't a long line. Then we went in and The Down To Earth Approach had already started playing. I was kind of sad that they had already started, but it was my fault that we weren't already in there because I didn't have a ticket before hand.


so we went up as close as we could get to the stage, which was fairly close because there really weren't that many people there, not as many people as I thought would show up. Which was perfectly fine with me.
That was the first time I had ever heard The Down To Earth Approach, I liked them a lot, they were pretty good. It was there first show on the tour.
Next up was Moneen. I love Moneen, and they were amazing of course, They had some new songs which were pretty good. I enjoyed them a lot. Joseph said he didn't like them too much though.
Next was Circa Survive <3333333. Oh my gosh they were fucking amazing. I am sooo glad I finally got to see them live. Even though Anthony Green doesn't sing half the lyrics it doesn't even matter, because he is beautiful, and talented for sure. They were extremely good. :) I took lots of pictures and a couple videos using my camera.
And then last but not least Saves The Day was up. We didn't stay for their whole set, I think because Mike had school Friday. But we did stay for 4 songs. And they were amazing, we got out of the crowd though after circa survive and headed up toward the back, but that was cool cause I had to pee really bad anyways. I called my boo so she could here a song from them. Although I found out she didn't hear it at all, she thought it was static :( At least I tried. Joseph and I went and sat at a table and I had told him earlier that I was going to take a picture of him and I for my myspace, and he said that he didn't care cause he was drunk enough to do it. So we attempted to take some but it was too dark so I had to turn on my flash and well my flash sucks cause its too bright so we just turned out as a white blob, so it didnt work out too well. I never got my picture :(
So when we went to leave we went to get merch first, Joseph got his shirt, and then we talked to the bassist from circa survive and then i borrowed $6 off of Joseph so I could get a hoodie. :) (Which I am wearing right now :p)

So when we were leaving we were getting followed by creepy people and then we got to the parking garage and we went to leave but we couldn't get out. it said something about we exceeded our time limit and we had to go back up to the lobby to talk to a person there, so we went back up to where we parked because there was a door leading into somewhere and we thought that maybe that was the lobby, well we got out and walked up to the door and we all decided we werent going to go in there, then joseph said something about having to piss and the next thing i know I look over and he's pissing in the corner haha.So Mike asked some guys that were coming to their car from the show as well and they didnt know either, so then he seen the scary black man that worked there and went and talked to him about it and then we found out that the little tiny room with the stairs in it was where we needed to go (which was right by the exit) and you had to like scan your card in there and pay and then come back out to your car and scan your ticket again to get out...it was fucking weird.

the drive home consisted of a lot of talking by joseph haha, but it was nice. I didn't mind. then they dropped me off and joseph had to pee again so he came up my driveway with me and then walked over to the sidewalk and peed on my neighbors fence haha.




and that was just about it


a very good night

let me start by saying..When I want to date someone, I am NOT asking them to be a father to TJ. EVER. TJ isn't their responsibility, he's mine, I am not looking for someone to be a father figure, I'm looking for someone to make ME happy. Guys automatically assume that by dating me they have to be TJ's father. and they don't. That is not what I want at all.

Talked to a few rad people I met at the show last night.
Did a lot of sleeping, trying to avoid thinking.
Which once again I failed miserably at.
I have been avoiding my homework all weekend.
Its 8:35pm and I have yet to do it.
I probably will do that after I write this entry.
Grades close this week.


This past week I seriously have felt like theres a hole in my heart.
That totally sucks.

"event","So I went to The Orange Street tonight. That was fun. I seen Asleep, The Midnight Renewal, Paulson, Babybear, Veas, Drowning Poet and some other band that I didn't pay attention to because the bassist was a complete jackass to Sebrina and I when they were setting up. Actually there were two other ones as well, uhmmm something pilot. they were good and then I don't even know what the other band was called, and I actually don't even remember seeing them haha. that must have been when I was zoning out.

Joe came and we passed out a bagillion Dissinagrace CDs and I got a chance to pass out my Widdlesworth fliars. That turned out well. 
I got The Midnight Renewal CD and I bought one of their shirts, I feel bad though because I told a guy from Asleep that I would be etting one of their shirts, but I didn't end up doing that..oh well.
The only downfall of the night was, the reason why I went...to take my mind off of shit....definetly didn't work. I failed miserably at trying to get my mind off of things, but I guess shit happens.

Joe made me a CD with a whole bunch of Anthony Green stuff on it, which made me smile :)
I am extremely excited for the Circa Survive show in April. Its going to be fun.


Well I don't think anything else really happened.....mmmmm...not that I can think of anyways.
So I think I am done for now..
I am really trying hard to keep up with this livejournal this time.
I think I am doing pretty good so far, don't you?

"event","So I have been thinking about my last journal entry. And I have already fucked up. I am once again worrying about boys, it was a good day and half not worrying about them. But its back to the old me, and I fucking hate it. I have been wanting to post a blog for the past two days. I really need to vent, I just haven't had the time. I don't even really know where to begin. 


Everyone has been busy with their significant other lately, or they have just been to busy to talk to me. So I haven't really gotten to talk to anyone, besides the same bs convo of small talk. It sucks. I mean I never really noticed how much I need my friends. There is just so much going through my head..if you only knew.
And I can't help but think that we are somehow drifting apart. You just seem so busy now. You have so much going for you. And I am happy for you, I really am..but there just isnt anytime for me, and it makes me sad. I know that I shouldn't be mad at you, but I am. Maybe I am not mad at you, just mad about the situation. I know it isn't your fault. It just sucks is all. Its almost like I am jealous because I am not the one you are hanging out with.
Its just complicated.



ugh
i dont know.
im not even in the mood to write anymore.
maybe later.

"event","Alright, so here is what I came up with..after thinking pretty much the entire night..


Well first off I realized that I really do care what people think of me..what a shocker.
I really wish I didn't care, but I do. I know that for the longest time I have been telling everyone to not care what everyone else thinks of them, and I have been saying that I don't care what other people think of me, but I would have to call bullshit on myself. I know that deep down I do care what other people think of me, and how they perceive me. I know that I shouldn't, because people are going to think what they want to about me, but I really can't help it. I also decided that I am going to try and work on that, but in order to do that I think I need to be happy with myself first..which I am definetly not. My appearance is one thing I am definetly not happy with, as well as my attitude. I am horribly mean to people that don't deserve it at all. I say things to people I shouldn't, especially boys. I tend to tell them exactly whats on my mind at the time, not even thinking about how it would make them feel by saying it. I am sorry for that. 

I have a lot more to post on this subject, but for now I will leave you with just this, because I am extremely tired.



Just know that I am determined to fix these things about me. I am sick of myself. Its time for a change"

"event","Why is it that boys, who know for sure that I like them, come to talk to me about their girl problems? I mean its not that big of a deal at all but I just get sick of it all. I just get sick of the boys coming to me to work out their problems. like I don't have enough problems of my own. I just am getting tired of it. Oh so tired of it. Its like they do it on purpose, although I know they don't..it just seems that way.  Its soo frustrating. I wish I was in New York. I wouldn't have this problem in New York. I wouldn't have stupid boy problems that don't even matter.

anways. Last night I hung out with Joe, we went to a movie. We seen Crash. I had never heard of the movie before, but it turned out to be a really good movie. Very sad. Things that we determined while we hung out included, where joe lives, he lives on the boarder of gren and portage lakes. haha he likes to say portage lakes though because it sounds nicer than green. haha. uhmmmm we determined that i havent seen many movies lately,he wants to get a show at the os with babybear because he wants slutty 15 year olds hahaha and then my favorite thing to talk about..it was said that not so much proven)that i am extremely young. I still disagree to that. When age gets brought into things it usually frustrates me, because i dont usually hang out with people my age, because they are all rediculously immature and mostly bitches. So I really hate it when the people I do hang out with make it a point to tell me how young I am. It sucks. 17 is not that young. and age is just a number.






alright I am done for now, I am sure there will be more later

"event","So I am very proud of myself for keeping up with my entries so far. Hopefully I don't start slacking again. This is a good way for me to vent seeing as though I know no one wants to here my bullshit. So if anyone does choose to hear it they can just read it on here because I probably won't say have of the stuff directly to you that I say in here just for the sake of saving you time and energy.

So my night last night consisted of, mass amounts of nothing, followed by some thinking (thinking about everything that was in my entry from last night plus some) and doing some HTML work for my journal layout. and the layout still isn't right. its pissing me off. but what I realized last night was, that is I don't stop my bitching, and chasing after boys that don't have any interest in me (that being all boys) I am going to end up old and alone....with a lot of cats. I don't want to be a cat lady. they freak me out, but if I don't start changing thats the way its going to end up. 

fucck
now i can't even think. why you may ask? because I can hear my brothers bed bouncing and something hitting the wall so I am assuming he is fucking his girlfriend AGAIN. fucking a that is disgusting. They are ALWAYS at it. and I mean ALWAYS thats so rediculous I GOT TO FIND MY HEADPHONES. god damn its 9 am. It is not necessary. especially when they fucked 3 times last night.

Alright, I can no longer hear anything but Hawthorne Heights..anyways. Back to wear I was. I know that there are two boys out there that say they have feelings for me. But one I don't like back, although at first I did...its just not there. Well, and the other....the other one could just be total bullshit. Just to fuck with someone. I mean he's an amazing guy. He could totally do better that a pathetic 17 year old, who doesn't even have looks to make up for being pathetic, with a baby. I mean he is a really great guy. He always finds a way to make me smile. But I really just think that there is only a one way interest there. The good guys never like me. Thats pretty much a proven fact. I don't know. Just thinking about all this is making me want to cry. Boys are soo frustrating. It makes me sick. The good guys never go for a girl like me, I get stuck with the assholes that don't give a shit about how I feel, its all about them. fuck that. I will just end up a cat lady. I am sick of being used. Totally sick of it. Ugh I don't even know anymore. It makes me think of the song lyric ""..boys like you are a dime a dozen..."" but not that one boy. He is way better than that. You can't say that a boy who sends you texts in the middle of night telling you that he hopes you are sleeping well and that he loves you, is a bad guy.. I mean I know he is amazing...but I don't think he loves me. I mean there isn't anything about me thats so great. ughh that makes me want to cry too. :( I hate this. I hate that I can't just let shit go that I have to analyze everything and it just makes it hurt even more.




I think I am done for now..

You don't have to be a livejournal user to leave me comments you know....so leave me some.
no one leaves me any on here but I know people read it.."

"event","So I know I already posted today, but I did infact say that I would post more later.

So now its later..and now I can really post.


Things are starting to look up a little bit I suppose.. I'm starting to realize who really gives a shit about me and who hangs around with me just so they know they always have someone there for them, but in return would never be there for me if I needed them. I realized that my heart isn't in Ohio anymore. And I realized that the boys I like never like me back or they are way to far away and won't come kidnap me. I know that I said that not a lot has happened lately. But actually thats pretty much bullshit. Because a lot of shit has been going on. More emotionally than physically..but there is still a lot going on in my life. I've been feeling pretty down lately. For the simple factor that when I look around me everyone is so happy. So damn happy. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad my friends are happy with their lives, but I just wish I could say that I am happy with mine. I wish I could just honestly say for once that I am happy. Cause if I were to say that now, it would be complete bullshit. I really hate that. I hate that when someone asks me how I am doing, I say I am doing fine when its not true. I don't want to have to lie about it but no one wants to hear my bullshit ranting about the shit going on in my head. I am sick of getting ditched by my friends for their girlfriends, boyfriends, or other friends. They assume just because I have TJ that I don't ever get to do shit anymore. I don't ever get to do shit because no one ever invites me along with them somewhere, or asks me to hang out. I am through asking these people to hang out because anytime I did they always said they were busy. Fuck that. I'm not going to sit around waiting for you to ask to hang out, when you can make time in your oh so busy schedule for me. Its complete bullshit, and you all know that. And this goes to a certain person who probably won't ever read this but I am going to say it anyways, just for the sake of venting..Don't EVER talk to me about getting rid of a baby, having a miscarriage on purpse or having an abortion. I don't ever want to talk about shit like that. Don't feed me the bullshit of ""I don't have any fucking support Jen, it's not like your situation. You have family, I don't"" Bull fucking shit you don't have family. EVERYONE knows you have fucking family that will back you up in a heartbeat. So don't ever give me that bullshit. Just because you don't have the guts to follow through with something thats your own fucking fault you don't need to blame it on family. Just fucking own up. And don't think for one second that you will get any sympathy from me about shit like that. I mean fuck, I already know you lied to me once about an abortion, saying you had to get one because the baby was growing in your tubes, I almost believed you, until you never got that abortion. and until you started hitting john up for money. Thats fucked up. That is SO fucked up. I can't even stand it, that how fucked up that is. So don't come to me looking for sympathy, cause it won't happen.
Anyways.. Why is it all the skanky non-worthy girls get the good guys chasing after them? But the girls that just want someone to like them can't get shit? I don't get that at all. I know Im not even close to being perfect, I have lots and lots of faults. But am I that horrid? I mean I really need to know what the fuck is wrong with me so maybe I can change whatever it is. Maybe I can fix it, maybe then I won't get rejected so much. Its kind of sad that when you get rejected so many times you can't even feel it anymore. A lot of people say its because I am too open about my feelings towards boys, cause I tend to tell them exactly how I feel about them..is that my problem? Cause I really am trying to stop doing that.. I just don't even know anymore.
who knows.



I think I am done for right now.. maybe I will post more later.

"event","So I am really going to try to update my shit more often. I hate neglecting my livejournal. I do it too often.

Nothing much has happened. I've been promoting an assload for Dissinagrace. Their debut show is April 28th at Screwy Louies. Everyone should go. If you live in Northeast Ohio that is. Im totally stoked for it. 
Then theres Widdlesworth's CD release show at The Lime Spider March 28th. You get the CD free with admission so everyone should go to that show too. They are both going to be amazing. 
Im looking forward to the Dissinagrace show more though, I have to admit.
Joe decided he wanted a street team for Dissinagrace and put me and Trey at the head of that. So I've been busy trying to spread the word around. you should check them out and if you like them I can send you the CD for free. http://www.myspace.com/dissinagrace
And if you are really interested in them then join the street team! groups.myspace.com/dissinagraceownsyou
You don't have to live around here to help promote them! 


Okay Im done promoting now. haha I swear.
School is going pretty good. I made the 3.0 club and theres an awards ceremony for it on Wednesday.
Apparently my whole family will be attending. Hahaha thats not too embarassing :p.
But since the ceremony is Wednesday I won't be able to attend the BabyBear show at The Lime Spider. Which I am very angry about. :(

okay on to other things...


Whats with everyone getting married on me?! Eric is getting married. Although he won't tell me anything about it. And so is Steve! this is insane!!

So have you ever gotten one of those annoying boys, you know... the ones that you liked there for a little while, and then once you got to know them you didn't like them so much, and then they wouldn't leave you alone? Yeah I have one of those boys. I'm pretty sure I can't stand him anymore. He drives me insane! Oy. I don't even know what to do. I try to avoid him at all cost, but I still don't think he gets it. I wish he would. Any suggestions?




Well I think this is long enough for now haha. I am going to try my best to keep this updated.

"event","So a lot has come in gone in my life. including the things i thought were there with someone and they werent. and i made a total ass out of my self in the process. that actually happened with two guys.
So I decided that Im done trying. I decided that there has to be something horribly wrong with me since no boys seem to take an interest in me. I dont know what else it could be. There HAS to be something wrong with me. Then theres this one AMAZING boy. And I truely mean amazing. but hes not from around here. hes the only one who seems to give two shits about me. and if he doesnt, hes a good actor. He pretty much stole my heart. for real. but as long as we arent closer in distance nothing will happen. and that really sucks.

we had our winter formal dance, I went with Cameron. We had a blast. and he made me dance with him for one song, even though neither of us can dance. it was the best thing ever. it made that night completely worth while. Too bad he doesn't give a fuck about me.

"event","So all I have been doing lately is studying. Or avoiding studying. 
I decided that tonight I am going to take a break from studying. I think my brain is crammed for right now.
Nothing too great has been happening, besides Patrick starting to walk me home. :) thats pretty much the highlight of my day now. 


I have a long weekend and then tuesday, wednesday and thursday are exams. so i will be getting out at like 12:30 which is cool. But I am not looking forward to exams at all. I will probably fail all of them, and get grounded for the rest of my life, but whatev. I don't ever get to do anything anyways.



hmmm. Not much else has happened so I think I am going to end this entry short, just like the rest.

im really slackin at the whole online journal thing hahaha

Not much has really happened. Uhm, Kory and I haven't talked very much lately... I've been talking to this guy Pat a lot in the past few days. I've decided I am going to call him Patrick though, cause I like that name. :) Midterm exams are next week, that should be extremely fun....not. I'm pretty sure I am going to fail them all. Since I suck at school and all. Especially my chemistry exam. Thats going to be horrible. I need some serious help on that subject.







Anyways. Onto something different. I decided that I really need to get out of my house. Patrick :p has been wanting to hang out for a few days now, but I haven't been able to leave, and it sucks because I really want and need to get out of here. Its like a fucking prison.



but i will write more later, for now, i have to go call patrick back :p"

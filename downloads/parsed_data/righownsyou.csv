"event","Kso. I had a terrible day. I probably have the largest vocabulary in my class, but she thinks some othermkid does. I bet hr doesn't even know what communist is! I is so annoying, I'm just to shy to raise my hand. Besides when I do, she never picks me. Any way- back to the day- First thing in the morning the -get this- the guidence counciler comes. I was all, Wtf? But I didn't  say it. B) And then at recess they ignored me, at lunch too. Then in gym, some one said 'ewww' I looked. ""Ewww..."" I abreed. Then they were all ""Why did you say that?"" And before I could answer, some other girl spat out ""Because she always copies people"" Real important like, but she's not. Then I spent recess alone.:( -ish sad- And now I'm sad for the rest of the day it sucked. Kthnx."

"event","So I'm talking on neopets, and we're talking about how we are how attached we are. (way too attached). And of course my best bud, Rylie started the board. 'Course she's not exactly my best bud, but whatever. Anyway, now we're talking about MySpace. What the heck is that? I think that's a good thing, or is it bad? I REALLY wonder. So yesterday, I fell asleep reading, again. I'm about half way through the book. 'Tis good. Last night I was reading FreaKY FaCTs, and Words of Wisdom. They were funny, some were. But right now, I ish bored, so I ish writing in here... '_' IDEA! I'm onna go erm.. Do something... Nah. How about playing game cube? No. I'll just chat and type away at my journal. For some weird reason we are talking about a perverted old man who is in jail for life... Dangers of the internet... -shifty eyes- xP I'm paranoid."

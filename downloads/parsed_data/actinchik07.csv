"event","well yesterday was tons and tons of fun!!!

i woke up and dragged my mother out of bed to go see jake play paintball (which was awsome!!!). I felt bad cuz it started at 11 and i got there at 2 :( because my mother wanted breakfast. ugh   So we finally get there after getting lost twice (and we had directions..so sad). So i'm there with my ""unlimited"" t-shirt that he gave me and i go sit down cuz of course i was completely lost when out of nowhere i hear like 10 dif ppl calling my name. Which caused me to turn around and see THE hottest guy walking towards me ;)
i was SOO happy i found ppl that i knew!! lol  so jake leads me over to his crew and i meet everyone!!  Sam (jake's older bro), Tom and jeremy (bros), scooter, mark, brittany (jeremy's gf), jake's mom susan (who's pretty cool and got alogn with my mom pretty well....)jake's dad ned who has a freaking awsome mullet!!! and a kid named ryan who i've never heard of but he seems cool.

after hanging out with them for a bit at diehard, we found out that they had won 1st place and got a bunch of prices from the store. they decided that they were gonna go and eat at wendy's and then they were gonna go swimming. after some begging and pleading with my mom she finally said that i could go with them. so we all leave diehard and my mom decided to go grocery shopping... weird.  after an hour of talking to random ppl at the mall we leave and we come back home. a lil while later i'm hanging out with jake and sam. we got to the front of the pool where we had to pay and the chik looks at me like ur def not 18 but whatever. sam paid for me which was pretty cool of him considering he just met me lol. so we go and sit down and then teh rest of the ppl get there which are brittany, scooter, tom and jeremy.  of course since i'm by far the youngest person there they made fun of me :(  but it was ok cuz i got to see jake soaking wet and in trunks! lol

around 6 we left and i got to see jake's house which was pretty cool and i got to meet his uncle lol. after jake changed we left and we came back to my house and we ate pizza!! after that he had to leave and we sat outside for about 45 mins lol. then he left and i was sad :( 

so to sum it all up... YEASTERDAY WAS THE BEST DAY EVER!! lol

i'll write back later and uh yeah


bye bye!"

So we uh kinda scarf down 2 pizzas and we go to the movies! Since i had to be back home at 9 (btw i hate some rents)we watched about 45 mins of The Longest Yard. It was a pretty good movie esp the part with the guys who think they are girls saying ""give me a ""D"" give me a ""I"" give me a ""C"" and well u know the rest!! lol

So um i woke up to the screeching from my mom telling me to wake up ""WE'RE GOING SHOPPING!!!!"" dude i can never turn down a shopping trip so i got ready in like 20 minutes!! which all my friends know is very close to a miracle. but since i got ready so fast my mom took an extra long time...(about 1 hour and 55 minutes longer than her usual hour)so atleast i had time to talk to ppl on the net. So then off we go *without breakfast* to Old Time POttery where the second u coem in u can already feel teh oldness closing u in!! For some odd reason i ended up buying some aroma therapy thingies which smell pretty good. 

Then we went to the mall where i got some clothes and uh clothes! Then me and mom walked around for a while and we ran into.... Eric Rice... weird.lol Then we went to KFC!!!!!!!

Then we came back hoem and ate the delicious food that's heaven sent.. jk!

After 40 minutes of begging my mom let me invite jake over (weeeee!!!) and we sat around and did .. stuff and watched The Mummy! lol fun fun!!


Then i watched Jay Leno... never again.

"event","Well today im freaking bored out of my mind!! So i'm gonna talk abo my weekend starting with friday. On friday i woke up early (10 in the morning is earaly for me) and ate ... my blueberry muffins!! lol then i sat down and watched tv for a while. Then it was time to get ready for the visit from my hottass bf Jake! And then.. he came over and we uh hung out! lol

Then he had to leave and i didn't want him to so we stood at the door for like 30 minutes! Those were some fun 30 lol.  Then my mom got home and we went to walmart where i convinced her that i should go to zach's!! And she let me so i went to zach's b-day party with Jake and everyone was there!! Fun fun! We all hung out for a while and had some pizza and cake and ape and shann went looking for squirrels... that got me a lil worried. Then Jake took me home and he ended up being at my house until 1 in the morning!

On Sat i went to the taste of cinci.. which sucked!!! I didn't know getting hit on could damage my self-esteem this much. And out of all the people that i could see there... it had to be Alex LeDuc! But i also saw courtney and kayla and i got a free makeover AND some toothpaste and brush stuff! 

Then today i woke up and i ate stuff then got my hair done (so girly but i needed it) and now i'm typing away on here!!!

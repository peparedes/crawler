"event","Anyone remember that old song.....don't know what it is called...but the lyrics are like .....
What is love baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more...lol I remember that song ...ahh good old techno 80s stuff....(if anyone knows the name of that song and who it is by please let me know)


so I was talking to someone special....and we were trying to figure out what exactly is love ...I came up with two theories on that 

Theory #1 (the shorter of the two) 
is that we will never know...people try to figure out what is love.....well love is nothing more then a word that was given to a feeling that someone felt........someone felt a certain way towards someone else and said I will all this love...thus love was born.......that's why we can't find love.............because love is only a word

Theory #2 ( my favorite)
we can find love and we can know when it is found...many are now asking me how...heres why I think this........... love isn't a feeling as much as it is an action or a way of acting......love is ( to me) 
that first smile you get when you see her.......
the way she gives amazing hugs....
the way you drive the long way home just to see if she might be outside......
the way you put her before everything in you life.....
the way she stares at you when your lying together.....
the way you seem to automatically drive safer when shes in the car....(most of the time)
the way her lips move when she says  I love you.....
the endless nights you spent together....
the way her head rest on your shoulder....
the way she always seems to be right.....
the way her kiss drives you crazy...
the way she makes you smile when your down....
the way that every minute your without her is a minute that your thinking of her......
the way that no matter where life takes you, you will never forget her.....
the way that she walks, talks and acts.....
the way that this list could go forever............
Love is.....
Going the extra step when your not even asked
doing something you swore you never would....and only because she asked you
love is that and so much more 
the walks on the beach together
enjoying a star filled night alone 
just falling asleep together in each others arms
mixing all three...falling asleep on the beach together with stars in the sky and no were else to be

To me love is so simple yet so complex ...it boils down to one thing..........

Love to me ........
Love to me......is....
Love to me is ....HER"

"event","last night was crazy   started off at about 3:30 4  with Kim and her family at her cousins b-day party...then Kim left with jul and that's when .....all......hell.....broke.......lose....
the birth of three legends    shitbrick (rob), Sebastian (nick), and Crash (me)....first we hit up target but they had NONE of the shit we wanted then so we few on over to wal(fucking)mart....some fat ass fucking bitch was like you guys don't know much about cats do you...so rob turned around and screamed ""I'm gonna REGULATE this shit"" and she gave us a look and walked away down her isle......    
so we bought our shit there and headed to a get some achol. ""for rob""  ;-) ......then we rode back to his apartment  knocked a few back and then we took a walk....walked about 40 yards to a fence with a lot of holes.... there were to cops standing there but they didn't say anything so we kept walking then rob being the bold one just starts walking into peoples houses and shit ....so nick an I followed.....nothing in the first house so we walked out the door...there was a group of people about 6 girls and 5 guys hanging out so we stopped behind them and started listening.....the one girl was talking about field hockey so rob jumps in and was like I play field hockey......she just looks at him and was like no you don't so we all laughed and she goes plus you would have to wear a skirt....that's where I jumped in ......I was like he's done it before and its not that pretty.....so we laughed again......it was funny...so then rob was like wheres the beer at so the girls were like over here....so we followed them to the beer......there names were Erin and Lauren and I can't remember the other 3's names......but we all gathered round the keg...rob stole Erin cup and drank it all so I got back in the ""hell pit"" and got more from the keg...and gave some to Lauren and some to Erin but rob took the cup again and drank like 1/2 of what I gave Erin so who knows.....then we started to walk away from the girls and rob ran into so guy he use to know but there was some bad blood between them so the kid wanted to jump rob ....but he never did....nick and I decided to walk away before we got involved so I went back to Lauren and Erin with nick and I tried to get them to give there numbers to nick because he needs a girl but I think Lauren didn't like him and Erin was to drunk to remember her own number...go figure...then Lauren asked were rob was an I said he is trying no to get jumped by three guys bigger then me and nick and she offered to go over and be like come one baby we go to go ..but I was like the way that guy is acting he might jump you too so she was like ok hope they don't kill him...and she went back for more beer
so nick and I stood there and made sure nothing happen to rob.........then rob came over and was like fuck him so we decided to leave....walked back to his place and played with the kittens then I followed nick back to his house to make sure he drove home safe then back to my house for that wonderful thing called sleep.....

all in all FUCKING FUN NIGHT

#4From Autumn To Ashes- The Fiction We Live---yet again GREAT CD
#5 Autopilot Off- Make A Sound----I already had a burnt copy but I liked it sooooo much I wanted to support the band buy buying the cd

ok heres what I have to say about the whole burnt cd stealing music thing.... if I download a song and like it 90% of the time I buy at least one cd from the band if that cd is good I buy more if not I download songs find ones I like and then burn a cd so at least I am still getting there name out there so they can fuck off and thank me

so I decided to ride my bike today an I was riding al the way to rowan but on the way home I got a flat......and so I was like I can keep riding...yea right.. after about 2 miles I was dead  its a lot harder then I thought   so I called my sis and she picked my up

my love it grows 
for you

and without you near
my heart it shears
in two

so when you fall down
I won't let you drown
with out me

I will stand up tall
lean in and fall
down deep

then I'll hold on tight
to all that's right
and slip away

a cry for help is made
as the light it fade
from me

then I'm all alone
and the waves they moan
in pain

when the night breaks day
my heart will fade away
last breath

and as the moons sits high
high above the sky 
I die

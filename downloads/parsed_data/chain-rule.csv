But, she said, 'Just because they read 'funnest' doesn't mean they'll learn to say that. I've never heard a kid speak in a Yorkshire accent because they read 'The Secret Garden' or say 'Have you any wool?''""

I'd go, too, if tomorrow weren't the one weeknight I've ever had to work. I'd go despite knowing that I am stiff, that I would not be able to bring myself to move like you. I'd only stare, and shiver, ecstatic, outside with you afterwards in the dark, colored lights, a short walk to the T station and tiled walls and urban art and you, your eyes, eyelashes, and liner like calligraphy, turning up. That tiny dot near the top of your cheek, short fingernails, permanent anklet, all the way inbound and out, see you in the morning. Maybe kick the wall when I turned the corner, out of sight; already I miss you."

'The Canon' presents the fundamentals of science: numbers and probability, matter and energy, the origins and structure of living things, and the natural history of our planet, solar system, galaxy and universe. These are, she judges, the basics that every educated person should master, and a prerequisite to a genuine understanding of the material in any newspaper's science coverage. And she presents these basics as beautiful: worthy of knowing for their own sake, even if they won't help us save the planet, age successfully or compete with the Chinese.""

"event","""Sharon Tollefson, a guidance counselor, had one promising student vanish in the aftermath of the raid. The young man, whom she identified by only his first name, Santiago, had been attending both day and night classes to graduate this spring. Ms. Tollefson was helping to arrange for him to visit a local college, where he planned to study law enforcement with the goal of becoming a police officer.

The first morning of the raids, April 10, Santiago took his required state test in writing. The next day, when he was supposed to sit for the math exam, he did not show up at school. Ms. Tollefson has since heard rumors that he was deported to Mexico.""

"event","""Abu means 'father of,' and is often used as a nickname. A man's friends might refer to him as abu, followed by the name of his first-born son. Or they might pair abu with something less concrete. The name of the terrorist Abu Nidal, for example, means 'father of struggle.'

The term can also be used in a more colloquial sense. A guy with a moustache might be called 'Abu Shanab,' or 'father of moustache.' You could even refer to a place or object as 'the father of' a certain quality. 'Shibshib abu khamsa gnieh' literally means 'flip-flops, father of $5,' but it would be taken to mean 'a $5 pair of flip-flips.' Similarly, the place name Abu Dhabi means 'father of gazelles,' which can be taken to mean 'place with lots of gazelles.' (The word ibn can be used in similar phrases. An 'ibn halal' is a good guy, while an 'ibn haram' is a son of a bitch.)""

But no, I want to know if you did. No fifteen-year-old should make me go weak at the knees. Still, things changed once we were there, and it was silent. Plugging in our computers under the table, passing each other cords. Whispering at first, then typing messages, sitting side by side. You leaning over to watch the words appear on my screen. You laughed, swore, everything too loud, even though you're usually silent like the hall. Me staring at you. Your eyes are blue in a certain light. The sides of our legs touching, neither of us moving, for a while. Once you moved, once me. I even lied, said I was sorry. But for a while, neither of us. I felt your warmth, I think, maybe only in the perfection of memory. We fought across the screen, finally ended up in the right place, both of us grinning. Our fingers meeting, slow to draw back, reaching out for your attention, the softness of your arm. And then I had to go, stood and waited for you, and you came and we left, and outside, hesitated at the top of the stairs."

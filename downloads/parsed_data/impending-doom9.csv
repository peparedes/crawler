"event","Life has been tough - I have been riding an emotional rollercoaster for the past few weeks. Fun fun fun. I do like the highs (how I missed the highs) but fuck the lows kill me. It's like let's put my heart in a blender and turn it on then off the on again and see how much it hurts! Ha ha what fun!
While I am left behind holding what is left of my heart (which I must add is nothing but a mess of blood and shreds of muscle fibers), you are oh so happy with someone else. What eve! You can try and replace the unreplaceable but it is impossible. There is only one me (Yay! the world does not need more than one fucking nutjob). 
And I wonder... would anybody miss me if I was gone? You know what I think, NOT ONE!!! well, maybe my kitty Stanley, he does seem to love me.
Alas... c'est fini! Over. The End.

Goodbye"

"event","I had such a crazy dream - I was following a pot-bellied pig around through a trailer park and everyone had their doors open so we would just walk in. We ended up seeing my grandma (whom I have not seen since I was like 12). Very weird. But the pig was cute :). Nothing really happened, it was stupid. But the pig was REALLY cute :P hehe.
I woke up in the arms of the most amazing man ever. What a wonderful way to start the day :). I am so happy to be with him now and forever. Mmmm... he smells so good :P hehe. Ooo... and I smell like cocoa :).
I'm getting excited about joining karate - I might really suck but I really need to start something. I'm getting way too lazy and watching way too much tv/movies. No energy whatsoever - and this summer I totally want to try so many things and I don't want to be so flubby :P. Ewww... flubbiness. All junk food has now been banned!!! Good thing my sweetie wants to do this too :). Today is the first day - we are both walking to work. Little steps :P. Ooo... this will be fun :)."

"event","I live under a rock - no one knows I'm there. 
I'm made of glass - everyone is scared to break me. 
My life is a dream. A bubblegum dream where everything is sweet. Reality hurts. Happiness is fleeting - butterflies die. I am holding on for dear life. Holding onto a dream. I see myself smiling and people around me are happy I'm there. People like me. 
Did I ever do anything right? Do I always mess things up? I try to be the sweet girl - maybe I try too hard. Maybe I don't understand anything or maybe I just can't see. 
I am in a world of make-believe. Tears of joy, tears of sadness. An emotional roller coaster that I want to get off. But if I get off, I won't feel anymore - maybe it's worth it. Life is worth it. All the ups and downs. As long as I can feel. Emotions are the only thing that is real. You can't pretend to feel things - you might be able to fool others but you can never fool yourself. 
Love is the best feeling in the world - but it comes with so many highs and lows. I am my own worst enemy. My insecurities are killing me. If I could only open my skull and cut them all out of my brain. One by one. Then burn them. 
Stop dwelling on the negative."

"event","Here I am once again - I'm sure no one will ever read this but meh. This is my attempt to let things out instead of keeping everything bottled up inside as it will only eat away at me. It's like a monster devouring my insides leaving me empty and in pain. Terrible pain. The kind of pain that makes you want to rip your heart out just so you don't feel anything anymore. 
I refuse to let my mind play these stupid games with me anymore and make me think negatively all my life. That affects other people too as I have realized. I am only pushing everyone away from me, which is the one thing I fear most - being left alone. 
Anyways, now that I let that out - I am trying to fix everything. No more putting myself down thinking I'm fat and ugly, not interesting or fun or nice. No more doubting if my sweetie truly loves me. No more thinking friends would rather not have me around.
Everything in my life is great so I have no reason to be upset. My sweetheart really loves me and my friends do care about me. I just need to open my eyes and see all the nice things people do for me instead of looking for things to twist into something bad. *deep breath* Let all the evil thoughts out.

Grrr... birds suck. They ripped open our garbage this morning and it was everywhere. Insane mess of styrofoam, paper, cat litter (YUCK) and a retarded old phone (damn that phone to hell!!! - those birds could have taken that). Anyways, that was fun. Probably the most exciting thing that will happen today. 
My cats are so friking lazy, they should totally be amusing me with their search for the mysterious red dot (which is actually only a laser pointer and I am the almighty god who has the power to make it appear or dissapear!!! mua ha ha ha!) NOTE - that should be goddess, I am female... last time I checked anyways.
I hope we get a puppy one day - this little house of ours would be nice with a puppy :). Oh the excitement! But alas Rayne would hate the poor little thing *Rayne being the insane kitty with ADD* (and I would need to be home more to train the little guy). So I must wait, perhaps after we have a baby. Which will be after the wedding - so it will be awhile.
Well... ummm... that's it for now, I guess. I love you Dustin, always and forever.

P.S. Karen is a douchebag hehehehe... :P"

"event","Sometimes I can't help but feel so alone. That no one really wants me around and would be much happier without me. 
I don't want to make anyone feel like they have to talk to me or spend time with me. I suppose no one really reads this anyway but I just need to get my feelings out for me. 
I wish I could be better so people would feel they could confide their feelings to me like a friend. 
I miss the friends I had - it seems I have lost everyone even though I'm sure most of them would still talk to me. I would love to see them again soon and just have people to talk to and have fun with.
I also wish I could be better for you, my love. I am sorry for all the upset I cause you. You are my everything and I will always love you sweetie."

Ummm... so... my kitty stinks, my hair feels like straw, plain yogourt is kinda sour but I like it anyways, this hat on my head is starting to feel weird, pretzels in a chocolate bar are good but still strange and salty and I don't like salt *gags*. Ok, so my mind is messed up and I am bored. I will eat my fake crab and be happy :) then read my Harry Potter book in the sun and burn. Ahh... I hope Dustin gets a day off this week so we can do something fun like go to the beach and I shall make a uhhh... sand something or other :P. Yes, that would be nice... before I go completely insane trying to occupy my time. 

P.S. Dustin, I love you :) and you've got really nice buns :) mmm... Dustin's buns :D"

"event","Gah! Too much stress! I only have a few weeks of school (with still so much left to do) and nine consecutive days of exams! I think I might just explode-have my brains bits fly everywhere. 
I went to the SPCA this morning and I had to restrain a huge fat cat who was sick and old (wonderful combination if you want to be attacked to death!) while my partner tried to give it a pill. I had to use my superhuman strenght to keep this cat from killing us. Why do I always get the nastiest cats to restrain? I'm just really glad I didn't get attacked this week (unlike last time I went there).
Anyways, I can't wait to see my sweetie tonight. Super duper cuddles for him when he gets home :).
How I adore every little thing about him and love every minute we spend together. He has made me so uber happy :). I love you Dustin *kisses*

P.S. I have found my soul mate and it is Dustin :)... the greatest man ever!"

"event","I had a test today, it sucked. It was cold outside, that sucked too. I'm so tired and I don't feel like doing anything at all... I feel meh, and I miss my Dustin. I love my sweetie; being away from him sucks and having only a few friends who all live so far away really sucks too. There is nothing fun to do alone. 
Gee... this is way too depressing for me. I need sleep, and cuddles. That will make me happy... and loving messages from my sweetheart (and those silly ones I get too). 

P.S. Dustin, I love you and I always will. We're perfect together, like peanuts and bubble gum :) :P.

Ok, so I don't feel so down anymore. This change of mood happens alot... it scares me. I am losing my mind. La la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa What is a moon pie anyways? Why am I asking that, I dunno... I think I saw it in someone else's journal message, oh wait! it was a reply from Dustin. Yea, so what is a moon pie?"

"event","Wow so nice outside today :)... nice enough to walk around naked!!! Hehe, anyways... a pretty good day at college today; I got to do a fecal floatation (ewwww) with cow manure (ewwww) for my instructor to check on how well it was done and give me a mark. Yea, so I did pretty good and luckily the cow did not have any parasites (yay for the cow!). AND I gave medication to a little kitten (mmm... pink goo). Stupid *cough* apple juice *cough*... trying to kill me *cough*. Never shall I drink apple juice again! Right, so now that I am not choking on juice, I should go study for another one of my thousands of tests. Ahh the misery. 

P.S. My sweetie pie is damn hot!! hehe *licks*"

"event","A pretty lame day today (so much so I wanted to knock myself out). Nothing exciting happened other than I was able to leave school early since one of our instructors wasn't coming in this afternoon (woot). AND it's a fairly nice day outside which makes me happy, though it was quite windy walking home. I considered stopping at the tattoo and piercing place to get my nose pierced once again but decided against it (why? I dunno... perhaps I shall do it tomorrow when I am more in the mood for blood splatter, intense pain and snot running down my face hehe *I might be exagerating a little there*). I'm so very hungry right now (I think my stomach is eating away at itself). So very tired too. Perhaps I shall be productive this afternoon and finish my homework and studying (eck... ewww... gags). Anyways, off I go to amuse myself with whatever I can find :P.

Anyways, we now have 8 kittens in our class to take care of which is going to be great :) (poor little kitties had no where else to go... no more foster homes at SPCA). There was another Guinea Pig at the SPCA today and I wish I could take it home (I wish I could take them ALL... all the little critters who need a home!) Nothing else exciting has happened lately. Stupid tests and homework galore! Anyways, karaoke tomorrow night which I'm excited about (I love hearing my Dustin sing :)... mmm singing Dustin). Tonight should be good too... lots of snuggles with my sweetie :). I suppose I should go do some homework now *gags* or maybe I'll just do nothing! mua ha ha (wow I need something to do right now or I will lose my mind over here surrounded by the little gerbils plotting some evil scheme)..."

"event","Argh... my cat won't stop eating everything it gets its paws on! Everyday I come home to find the garbage can tipped over and its contents spread out all over the apartment... with some even missing! (did he eat it or what!?) He can be so gross sometimes, like who the hell would want to eat the tips of Q-tips after they've been used!? like wtf? Urgh... I don't know what to do with him. 
On a happy note, my Dustin brought home 7 gerbils last night so now we have a total of 10! I know that's crazy but his friend couldn't keep them :(. We'll have to find homes for a few of them now but until then, yay for more little critters :).
I better go do my homework and clean up before Dustin comes home. Blah... so lame but I've got nothing better to do right now (messenger must be screwed up, usually Dustin would be on right now and I could be talking to him instead of myself :P).

P.S. I love you Dustin."

Some of the lambs were hopping around like popcorn! hehe silly lambs :) I think my Stanley <--- cutest kitty ever!... would like to have a little lamb friend now :)
I'm hungry. Ahhh... the scary growls coming from my belly! I better go eat some peaches... no candy, no junk food; must get in shape for summer, want belly ring back! (even though it will probably only get infected again, hurt like hell and fall out... ah well.)  
I can't wait to see my Dustin tonight. I love him more than anything and I love every minute we spend together :). *uber kisses to the sexiest man alive*

Now all I have to do is wait for my Dustin to get home and snuggle him like crazy :)... and play Mario Party of course :P. 
It's raining today :) (happy happy! cos at least it's not stupid snow)... now if only I could go play in the mud (wouldn't that be just the greatest!?) All wet and dirty :P... like chocolate pie except chocolate pie is not wet or dirty but it can be messy :P Mmmm... pie
Anyways, I should go do whatever now and stop writing nonsense!

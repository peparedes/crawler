Angelica - Best Actress
Me - Best Supporting Actor
Best Ensemble
Best Scenery
... That's awesome for our school, since we suck so horrible bad at everything! lol

Big Update... I finally came out to my mom, and she was like ""I already knew about it."" So apparently, she already knew about me, Tony, Josh, and now she knows about Alex. She is actually thinking about letting Alex come here in June and letting me go there in July. ... That's like uber awesome!!

Um... there's really not much else to say...

Much love to my boy JOSHERS who's just uber uber awesome! I lovers him to death, and I hope we can continue this great friendship of ours. Who knows, maybe some day we can have a physical friendship, and not just an online one...

Much more love to my baby boy ALEX who's just uber uber uber sexy! I lovers him to death and beyond! I can't wait 'til June when you come up here, or 'til July when I go down there!  .. I know I'm gonna cry the first time I get to physically see you in person.   ... I'm so freaking excited, and I still have two months to wait...!"

"event","""God, I feel horrible, i feel asleep on the phone with the person i love, I hate it, BABY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH........ It's been over 2 weeks, and our love keeps growing. I wish we will be together for our lives. ALJ <3 SJAF....Crying myself to sleep, i am the most horrible person on the planet.*cries*""
.... The away message of a boy who fell asleep while on the phone with me, and forgot my real middle name was Jacob. Granted, I didn't remember his birthday was November 19th, but I knew it was either that, or the 18th, so I was at least in the ball park.
Oh how I love the boy named Alex Lee Jenkins (ironically, I have a friend named Amber Lynn Jenkins.... both are A. L. Jenkins lol). How I adore him so, and how I wish to spend my entire life with him. Sure he obviously has his faults, but I do as well, so it's all good.
Apparently, I've made all my boyfriends fall asleep on me at one time or another during our relationships. Tony did it to me towards the end of our relationship. Josh did it to me because I bored him too much. And Alex did it to me tonight because he was too tired from school and work, and didn't want to be rude by going to bed, which, happened anyway.
Oh well, shit happens, then you die!

Anyway, the first three nights of the musical were this past weekend! Wow was that exciting! I didn't mess up once! I had a few slip ups because of too much spit in my mouth, but nothing major and noticeable.
Friday Night (opening night) there were these chicks from Springdale that tried to mess us up. They were taking pictures of Karl (Conrad) and Zeke (Hugo) because ""Karl was so hot"" and ""Zeke was so adorable"". So, instead of turning their cell phones off like we had asked, they took pictures of Zeke and Karl with their phones, and it messed up our mics. Unluckily for them, we didn't have a Gene Kelley judge in the audience that night. So, uh, nice efforts girls, but it was all in vain, since we didn't have a judge!
Saturday was supposedly our ""cursed"" night, from what Bill (Albert Peterson) told everyone. In the end, it was one of the best performances at OLSH to date. Ooo, and I got to see Jovanna, Haley, and FRANKI again! Oh god I love those girls so freaking much. I haven't seen them since, well, Christmas. And before then, June 4th, when they left OLSH. So sad :-(
Sunday was freaking awesome as well! My mic was messing up the entire night though. I'm just proud of myself being able to belt ""Ed Sullivan"" (Hymn For A Sunday Evening) and sing it extremely well when my voice was barely there, and I had a lot of flem in the back of my throat because of me being sick.

EEEEEECK! I am really exicted though! We got the cd's from our Diocesan Honors Chorus concert and stuff... and I'm extremely excited because I loved a lot of those songs, and I get to relive 'em again and again! ... Esepcially ""To Everything There Is A Season"" ... I freaking love that song! I can't wait to go to practice tomorrow and get the cd from Mrs. Hess, cuz I'll put it right in my cd player and listen. I'm so freaking excited!!

Other than that, bad stuff happened too. I'm not really going to go into details, since I really don't want to remember it. But let's just say... someone knows something about someones relationship with me, and now according to them, they're going to kill themselves, because they were in love with the same person as well, and well, now everyone's hurt. Any questions? Too bad, I'm not answering them!

I love my baby boy so freaking much! I can actually say it now, and not be scared someone will get mad at me, or him lol.
I love you so much Alex. I'm so happy we're together. I just can't wait 'til we can be together... physically.
*~* 2 weeks and counting *~*"

"event","Well let's see... right about now I'm pissed as hell at my principal, Sr. Francine.

Yesterday, Thursday, we had a performance of our musical for the sisters in the convent, and I needed to be early to school in order to perform. Well, having been awake for more than 72 hours... I needed to sleep. Wednesday, I slept for 3 hours... and still got up Thursday morning (though I missed the bus) in order to get to school early. Ok well, we left at 7:10 ... that would've been perfectly enough time to get me to school on time. Well, since Ambridge is such a fucking ghetto, it didn't ice the bridges. We hit a slick spot on the bridge, and slammed into the car in front of us. So, we had to pull over for about 10 minutes and get all the insurance information and shit. Yeah, that caused me to be late.
So, 1st period, Mrs. Hess (Assistant Music Director of the musical; Honors Chorus teacher) and Sr. Francine started talking to me. Sr. Francine never even asked why I was late, and when Mrs. Hess did, I said we were in an accident which caused me to be late. Neither of those whores asked me if I was ok or if my mom was ok. They apparently only cared that ""It was my responsibility as a fucking student to get to school on time"". I'm like ""What the hell should I do? Get in an accident, then hitch hike, or even fucking WALK to school? I mean come on.... That's fucking rediculous!"" Sr. Francine didn't give a shit about anything I had to say, and she continued to be extremely hypocritical when she interrupted my explanation. Meanwhile, she was bitching at me back in the 1st quarter about me interrupting Mr. Plocinik's little.... sentence thing, even though I answered what he was going to ask.... and she goes and does this now, but oh wait! I forgot! It's ok, because it's her, and she's all high and mighty and above everyone else, and what she yells at us for doesn't apply to her, because she said it. Excuse me, I forgot.
Any-fucking-way... Mrs. fucking Hess threatened to work with someone else in the play on my lines and everything so they could replace me... since BOTH OF THOSE FUCKING BITCHES KNOW ME SOOOOOOO FUCKING WELL.... that they fucking assume I'll be late today. (It's like 5:30am, Friday morning, by the way). It's like.... oh... yeah, you know me soooo fucking well.
Sr. Fucking Francine had the fucking nerve, in 8th period, to tell me that I couldn't stay (that's not the fucked up part). Then after I called my mom, she was like ""Going home on the bus isn't a problem, is it? Your bus driver knows where you live, and where to let you off? I mean, you haven't ridden the bus home in a long time, and you certainly haven't ridden it in the morning, so you're sure he knows?"" I'm like ""A. Allison Hannon's stop is my stop as well. B. Yes, he knows!"" .... Oh I wanted to fucking punch that bitch and put her out of everyone's misery. But wait! I'm sorry, again, I forgot. She knows me too well. She knows I haven't ridden the bus in the morning for so long, because she's so omnicient. You know fucking what? I've ridden the bus every fucking morning since she's told me about this fucking ""agreement"" that if I'm late, I can't stay for practice. She's so fucking ridiculous, it's not even funny. Hence, I'm not laughing.

On the other side of things, I was reading some older entries in Alex's journal a while ago, and anytime Josh (KY) said anything, I replied being all nasty and bitchy. I can't believe I was that fucking rude to someone. I feel so horrible... not only for me, but for Josh, since it was directed toward him. I'm so sorry Josh, if you're reading this! I didn't mean it... well, I did, in a sense... but I'm sorry for being so mean about it!
Alex ... oy .... Alex Lee Jenkins.   ... I love that boy so freaking much, it's like... hard to even describe the caliber of it. I was playing SIMS 2 this morning, and I made Alex.  ... After that, he met my mom, who introduced me (who was then, married to Joshua Rinaman) to Alex, who then fell in love with me. Right now, I'm at the part where our love is growing, and I'm growing farther and farther away from Joshua.  ... And it's funny. My sim doesn't care, Josh doesn't seem to care, and I'm still happy socially and stuff as a sim. It's amazing how parallel my sim is with my own life.

So, it's about 5:35 right now, and I have to start getting ready for school. Jessamyn's picking me up so we can guarantee that I'll be early today so I can perform at opening night! This is so damn exciting! I seriously hope I'm nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Everyone, even my directors (when they're not pissed at me, or threatening me with being replaced), said that my part, Mr. MacAfee, is so opposite from my real personality, that it's easier for me to act like that and be comfortable. I've taken the part to a new level, and Mrs. Manuel (main director) said that she, herself, would be surprised if I didn't get nominated. I may not win, which is fine, but I really wanna be nominated. I think that's an honor in itself.
And, before I get off, I'm waiting for Alex to wake his ass up, get online, and IM me so I can tell him how much I love him, and that I hope he has a good day and stuff.  ... Is that pathetic of me? I dunno, sometimes I feel like I'm TOO attached to him, and I'm not giving him the space he needs. I tend to get extremely attached to people when I like them, much less love them.

... I shall update later!   Love y'all so much, especially you baby!

MUAH!!"

"event","Well, this was definitely a somber day.

This kid, John White, from my school who was a senior, died this morning from Leukemia, and like everyone was really sad and crying, and I felt bad. Like, I felt bad cuz he died, and that's really really upsetting to die at such a young age (he was only 18), but like, I feel no remorse since all he did was make fun of me last year for being gay, so it's like ""Sorry he's dead, but at the same time, I'm glad"" yano?  ... I really hope that doesn't sound rude, cuz it's not intended to be rude, it's just intended to get my point across.

Meanwhile, I found out my friend from school, who shall remain nameless since I know he doesn't want anyone being told after he saw what I went through last year, is gay, and it was exciting for me, cuz that proves my gaydar is getting a lot better. Now, if just the other few that I think is gay tell me, or has someone tell me cuz I'll be hella excited and junk.

Musical practice today was productive for my ""wife"" and me. We learned ""Kids"" and practiced it like all day. I have to look at her boobs, rest my head on her boobs, and kick my leg up like I was getting my first ""foot popping kiss"" as they said in the Princess Diaries. I don't mind though, and neither does Emily (my wife) cuz she knows I'm gay and don't want her boobs :-).

In a huge amount of better news.... me and my rainbow are finally together :-). He's my little rainbow baby forever, and I'm his little sunshine forever. I lovers him so much... it makes me cry cuz I can't even see him on his webcam ::glares at the screen:: or be with him physically, though others can ::cries::.        I love you so much baby!! I'm so happy we're together..!   You better get your ass over here for Easter, or I'm gonna be upset with your momma! ... And I can't wait 'til my mom lets me stay over your house this summer... I'm gonna be so happy... I know I'll never leave once I get there!!  ::muah::

"event","I don't really know what to update about anymore. This is getting kinda hard when nothing exciting happens in your life. 

We have about a week and a half 'til the Musical performances. That's extremely scary, because nothing is close to being ready. None of the scenes are even close to being perfected. I'm getting extremely pissed off at the people who aren't putting in as much effort as the leads are because they're ""Ensemble"". Yeah, well fuck you cuz you keep the show together! Without you fucking people... the play wouldn't make much sense! We have a fucking week and like 2 days. Get your fucking acts together, we need to put this show on, and it better be damn good, or I'm walking out before our first performance. I'm very stressed over this, and so are the other leads, and no one seems to give a damn.

Josh and I broke up on Saturday, cuz I really couldn't take his crap anymore. He hurt me too much.
And speaking of Saturday! It was the Ambridge ""Sadie Hawkins"" dance and it was hella fun! I'm soooo happy I went, cuz I got to see a lot of old Ambridge friends that I haven't seen since I left them in 8th grade. ... I got pics taken too so as soon asn I develop them, I'll put 'em in here, if I like 'em lol! And omg! I was griding with a black lesbian during this one long ass techno dance! Let me tell you that girl was hella fun! She made my night so much more fun!
And speaking of ""Josh"". Josh, from Kentucky, and I made up. I did some growing up between Alex, Josh and I, and apologized to Josh for everything I said about him and stuff... 

Lisa and I hosted our mini game last night. Everyone who made the Final 7 said it was an aswesome game. We came up with a plethora of original challenges and stuff. Toward the Final 5, it got very emotional because two Survivors quit, and Lisa and I were getting fed up with everyone. We put soooo much work into making this game for their entertainment and they quit, and complain that about stupid shit, and it really got to us. We were seriously like about to quit that mini game, and not even consider hosting out long term game because we didn't wanna have to go through it again. But in the end, PJ won the game in a 5-2 vote on Rhiannon (Yeah, weird name for a girl!). And, we're still going to host our long term game, but we're going to make sure everything is perfect before we even open up the applications and stuff.

.... Alex baby I love you so much. I really hope I get to see you sometime soon. I don't wanna hafta wait 8, almost 9 months like Sammy and Tony have, but I'm willing to do whatever 'til we're together!

"event","I don't really feel like updating right now... There's not really much to say.

Thanks to Tony telling Kelly and Autumn about Alex, Josh now knows, and quite frankly, right now I don't give a shit.

A lot has happened between Alex and I, and there are things that I don't like, things that I do like. We made an agreement that, now that I think about it, I don't like, and I want it to end.

School's a living hell, and I want it to burn in hell. I'm sick of it, and they give us way too much homework that I'm too reluctant to do, because none of the subjects interest me.

Well, there's not much else to update about... my life sucks... school's hell... Josh is a bastard... and right now Alex is out with Josh (not my Josh, but another Josh who also likes Alex and won't fucking leave him alone!!!!) with some other friends... and I have basically no one to talk to.


... Bye bye !!"

"event","Let's begin with Thursday night. Alex, Josh (not my Josh) and I got into this ... pretty big fight that almost tore Alex and I apart. So blah blah, Alex, Josh and I made up and we're all cool now. Then... Mr. Sammy Ferraro had to tell Tony that I ""found someone"" that's actually making me, and keeping me happy. In response, Tony asks for Alex's sn. Bad Sammy Ferraro, cuz like a servant gets used by his master, Sammy got used by Tony to get Alex's sn. So I pre-warn Alex about stupid shit that I know Tony's gonna try to do, because he doesn't want me happy. So, Tony, like the fucker he is cuz he hates me and still wants me dead... got my font and color and all that shit, and made up a little convo between he and I that never happened, obviously, and showed it to Alex in a futile attempt to break us apart. Luckily for me, Alex didn't fall for it. Had he, because I know how convincing Tony can be, I would've lost the only person that really makes me happy, and I would've been stuck with Josh, who doesn't call me... ever.

So Friday I didn't go to school because I didn't wake up, for some reason. So... I decided to sleep the rest of the day so I wouldn't have to wait that long for Alex to call me.    .... In the end, he didn't because he never got his little cellular to call me. ::sigh:: So Yeah, there's one disappointment, though that wasn't his fault, primarily.
On the bright side of things, Alex, Aiden, Roland and I played Fantasy Big Brother for the hell of it with Pre-Jury Survivors. We were each 4 people, I think I was... Rudy, Shii Ann, Jeff, and Tina.  Yeah...  Tina was 2nd out.  Shii Ann was like 5th out. Rudy made the Final 4 I think. Jeff was nominated twice, and was saved by veto both times, so he made the Final 2. He beat whoever he was against (I can't remember) 7-0! ... Go me! I win again! lol... I love these games!

Saturday was just... fucked up. Kelly, Autumn and I went to the bowling alley to have fun and so I could get the papers to go to the Ambridge dance and stuff. This one kid, Josh (Oh god, a third Josh lol), that both of them liked was there with a bunch of his friends. So blah blah, they got annoyed and pissed us off. We got annoyed and pissed them off. But this one kid kept on annoying us, asking us, well, me, for money, randomly talking, annoying us more... I wanted to stand up and punch him. He was all like ""zip-a zoop-a zeep zup zump .... You sound like you're gay! Are you gay?"" I'm like ""Uh... wouldn't you like to know, faggish little Eighth-grader?"" He's like ""Y.... actually I wouldn't"" I'm like ""Then leave  before I hit you"" ... and he never bothered us again.   Hm.. acting straight has it's advantages sometimes.
'Kay so then we went to Walmart after... and these two really hot guys were like... stalking me. I didn't mind cuz they were like uber hot and kept looking at me, but it got kinda annoying. One of them kept brushing up against me then bein like ""Omg...!"" -_- Boys... can't live with 'em... can't live without 'em. -_- Boys... can't hate 'em, so you gotta love 'em, but you can't love 'em so you gotta hate 'em. How lame...

And today, so far... Alex hasn't come back from his friends house yet, and it's making me sad. And, my dad came home this morning, randomly, and now I gotta hear his bickering and pissing and moaning cuz the house is such a mess. God, I really hate men, and boys - but I gotta love 'em cuz I'm gay.... how... disappointing.

Later all! ::muah::"

"event","Ok well here's a long ass journal entry, so be prepared to read!

Over the weekend, Kelly, Josh, Autumn and I were supposed to go bowling on Saturday. I was excited cuz I would've gotten to see my baby boy again. But instead, he called Kelly and said his ""mom was sick"" and he had no ride down. Meanwhile, Kelly called his mom's cell, and she was perfectly fine. Lovely, eh?
So then Kelly called me like two days later (since we didn't get together again on Sunday thanks to the damn Superbowl (I fucking have football!)), and was like ""Josh wants to patch things up with you."" I'm like ""Yeah, so he can get me to not hate him for his 16th birthday and get laid"" -_- LAME! I'm always so used anymore! It's so not fair! I don't even know if Josh cares about me anymore! Oh well, it's his fault for treating me like crap!

So Tony, Sammy and I got into yet another fight over stupid shit. Tony got really pissed like normal and said all this really mean stuff. Sammy got mad and flipped on Tony. Blah Blah Blah. Long story short, Tony hurt himself, and he apologized to me for everything. I didn't think it was heart-felt, but I forgave him cuz I still love him as a friend :-)

Alright so all Tuesday night I was bitchy. Anyone and anything pissed me off. Alex pissed me off, Survivor pissed me off, Freddy and Kendra winning AR6 pissed me off, my mom, life, and the world in general. I felt so bad for anyone who came in contact with me. I almost made Alex cry a few times, which almost made me cry cuz I was so evil to him! I don't wanna hurt him... but I did! Damn me! Damn me to hell! My poor baby :-(. So, I took wednesday off of school in order to cool down and stay away from people.

So, late night, Lisa and I spent a good 5 hours planning our Survivor game that we're planning on hosting. That was an intense, creative, and explanatory 5 hours! I love you Lisa! :-) I'm so glad we're working on it together. Poor baby, Alex thinks others will think Lisa and I would rig it for Alex to win. K, we both love him (though, I love him sooo much more :-)), but neither of us would actually rig a game for him to win. Neither of us is that kind of person!
On the brighter (some-what) side of things... Alex and I had a few fights this past week and Alex thinks it's brought us closer together. I'd definitely agree cuz I love him more :-). I love him so much! I'm soo glad I've met him. He'll be my -older- baby boy forever (Let's hope - since Tony nor Josh have kept that promise to me!)!!
On the sub-topic of Alex - There's this kid, Josh, from Kentucky, that likes him as well. I know him previously from Sammy, and he's a great kid. Cute, and caring. I just don't want to lose Alex to him. I bitched him out in like replies to two of his replies to Alex's journal posts. All because of me being bitchy on Tuesday ::cries::. So, I thought I'd attempt to redeem myself by replying to his most recent journal entry and apologize... cuz I felt really really bad. I hate being the bitchy-PMSy-fucked up lout that I never am and never should be. So, again, I'm sorry Josh!
And last night, my stupid son of a bitch sister was having a problem with me living again, so she threw a hissy fit!! Dumb bitch! In the process, she grabbed my $350 necklace that I got from my confirmation sponsor in Nov. 2003. Yeah, that's now broken! Torn right off my neck! And my $200 cross that was on it from the same sponsor is now missing because it dropped off somewhere in the house! I don't wanna replace it since it has sentimental values, but I may have to! ::Cries::

So, we're finally at today! A strange and frustrating day. So far, I've tried to make challenges for the game Lisa and I are creating, and I have one idea. This is going to be a great ass game... I'm excited for when we're actually going to host it!! Meep!
Mmm, so in 4th/5th period, how about this new chick in our class, Christy, asked our Church History teacher if she could ""go to the bathroom"". When she went, I noticed that she took her entire bookbag. How... odd! Mr. McCarren was like ""That's some purse you got there!"" ... I laughed (lol)! Chelsea and I thought she went to smoke a cigarette or weed or something lol. Then about 20 minutes later, I fell asleep. Oh boy. It's been a long time since I've fallen asleep in any class!
So then, lunch. One of my bestest friends, Amanda, and I were talking during lunch about our musical director flipping out at practice when I wasn't there on Wednesday. We were talking about people who do whatever they want... finally getting noticed and getting bitched at. People's work ethics being complimented on! It made me sooo happy to have them finally get yelled at, because we had an extremely productive rehearsal today! I'm sooo freaking happy!
So then, in Health, 7th period... we got to make out Mannequins!! It was so fun! We got to perform CPR on them, then make out with them... kinda. We didn't touch the mannequin with our lips, but we pretended to, and it was just funny going through steps without actually doing the real thing with a real person. ... It weirded me out!
So... then in 8th, I heard the Anatomy class next door watching this really weird movie, and it freaked me out because all I heard was strange noises. Thank god they weren't moans or anything, or I might've gotten horny!
Musical practice was actually pretty fun. We went through the whole musical in ""speed mode"". Meaning, we went through the whole thing saying our lines as fast and as clear as we possibly could. It was hilarious ... but I can't explain it... it's one of the ""have to be there"" moments.  But I did notice that when I was changing from my uniform to 'normal' clothes... my 'normal' clothes made me look a lil more chubby. Maybe I actually am getting chubby. Oh boy! I dunno, but I still looked fuckin hot as hell! I'd date myself... as long as I was prepared for the day lol! Alex is so lucky to have me...! Josh was, but yano, he's a piece of crap that obviously doesn't care about me, so... his loss!

Oh! I forgot! Last night Alex and I played ""Fantasy Celebrities: Big Brother Season 11: American Idol All Stars"" (Yes, long ass title!) ... I played as Kelly Clarkson/Tamyra Gray/RJ Helton/Jim Verraros.    Guess who won?! One of my four!! RJ was 1st jury member... Tamyra was 4th. Kelly was 5th.   Jim Verraros won! That's 3 of my characters that won at FCBB! Queen Latifah in Season 7, Monica Lewinski in Season 10, and Jim Verraros in Season 11!!! I'm still waiting for Kelly to win, and I know she will!
I LOVE YOU KELLY CLARKSON!!! You're my life long obsession <3!

I'm gonna update about the rest of the night, if possible. So, I'll talk later!
LEAVE SOME DAMN COMMENTS! NO ONE COMMENTS TO MY POSTS! (Y'all are prolly too... lazy to read the whole damn thing cuz I write so fucking much, and go so damn in depth lol!)

I love.... boys!
I love.... games!
I love.... Alex Lee Jenkins!

... Peace!"

Because Of You

Kelly Movies !!!  Yay Kelly!!

Right now, I'm trying to gather a few pictures so I can make a Kelly Clarkson blend, yet again. I have like 50 already... so I'll post 'em once I make my newest one!! :-)


... This week was long and annoying. Monday and Tuesday... blah. Wednesday I was sick and didn't go to school, which meant I missed my last bowling match this year. Sad. Thursday I found out we lost by 9 pins. 9 PINS!!  .. Had I been there, I know we would've won. Damn my body!  ... Alex tried calling me but he called in the middle of my favorite part of ""The Voice Within"" and I wanted to sing it. By the time the song was over my mom came home and he couldn't call back. Boo!
Today was extremely lame. We watched ""Schindler's List"", which is a movie about Oskar Schindler's story about how he tried to save the Jews from Hitler (though he was a Nazi) during the Holocaust. It was pretty interesting, though it wasn't anything that great. I'll forget about it within a week. We had an hour long lunch today. It excited me... and I got to talk to Antonio Condoluci! How about, that kid is the hottest freaking person in the school... and I'm like best friends with his sister Franki!  ... God I love that girl! If I was straight, I'd so date Franki... and if Antonio was gay, I'd so date his hot ass, though I dunno if I'd love him cuz I don't know him! lol ... So blah blah blah, I came home and waiting for my lover Alex to call me. ... It took him a while, so I laid down cuz I was still tired and bored. He called at like 6:30, which I was like out cold during that time, which saddened me cuz I really wanna talk to him!
Right now, he hasn't updated his damn journal yet (there goes his ""I'm gonna update every day!"" plan) and he's playing in a Survivor mini game, which I wasn't online earlier enough to play. Grr... so I've been sitting here for the past like 2 hours waiting for him to either get voted out or win so we could talk... 

.. Hmm. Tomorrow's Saturday. I get to see Joshua tomorrow. If he feels like talking to me, then we'll have a 'talk' talk. I need to set things straight (and gay) with him. In a way, I wanna break up with him because he's not showing me that he loves me, but I don't wanna leave him alone for Valentine's Day on the 14th, his birthday the day after, then our 5 month anniversary 4 days later on the 19th. (Which, on the 17th, will be the 1 year anniversary of Sammy and I for when we first started talking to eachother! ... Yay!) So, I guess it all depends on what he wants to do. I'm willing to stay with him, and I'm willing to leave him...so it's his choice. If we're gonna stay together, then yay I still have a boyfriend. If he wants to break apart and find himself a more 'fun' person (since I'm ""boring"") then that's ok as well cuz that means that I could further develop my feelings for Alex without having to hold back because of Josh. So, we'll see what happens tomorrow. I'm excited to see him though... I miss him!

... Well I'm gonna go and make that Kelly blend now! Much love, and leave some comments! No one ever does :-(!!!
MUAH!"

"event","I had Diocesan Honors Chorus on Friday. Man... what a trip that was. Totally cute guys...! And it was seriously the most fun experience I've ever had in my life! It was so better than sex! The songs we sang were soo cool! My favorite is ""To Everything There Is A Season""... except I love the way we sang it. I don't like how the Byrds sang it, now that I've listened to ours, though I still love that song (""Turn Turn Turn"" lol). I got to see my bestest friend from St. James (Annie Oczypok (Agent Annis!)) and we had fun and good times! I missed her so much! I got info from our guest director about vocal coaching... so I can get voice lessons and be a better singer for American Idol 5... cuz I'm so totally gonna audition for it if I have the training!

It appears as though Sammy and Tony broke up on Friday... supposedly because of me, though I don't think I had anything to do with it.  On Sunday, Tony wanted to get back with Sammy, and things happened. One thing led to another... and Tony ended up calling me to settle things out.. civilly. We talked, and I convinced Tony about things.  Tony and Sammy are back together, happily. And Tony and I are friends again, and he doesn't want me dead anymore!  ... That's excited! ... After 8 long months, Tony and I are finally friends!!

And... I was playing a mini Survivor game, because I'm extremely bored like that, and I'm gay like that! Woot! But... It started with 16 people, like normal Survivor. (Keep in mind, this is with real people, in an AIM chat room...!) So ok... I had an alliance of 8 people. Blah blah blah... to make it short. I did what Survivors do... lie, backstab, and win Immunity. I made the Final 2 against my AIM lover... Alex! I won against him in a 6-1 vote! Go me!!

Joshua apparently doesn't care about me anymore, so I'm thinking I'm gonna break up with him soon, which is ok, because I deserve better. I'm going to at least talk to him to see if he wants to continue with us being together on the condition that he changes to make me happier, since I'll change to make him happier. I'm not just gonna give up on him, so yeah.   ... If he doesn't care to continue with us being together, that's ok, I still have my lover Alex to spend the rest of my life with! lol...

Well, I have to go to bed now. Sammy signed off, and I'm still talking to Alex, and a buncha other friends. I have Bio homework that I really need to do!! Much love!

"event","Good News... Sammy and I are bestest friends again!!! That really makes me happy cuz I thought he was gonna be the worst friend ever and never talk to me again after he made that choice. But he did, and he's trying to prove to me that he really goes give a crap about me :-)
My friend, who shall remain nameless, also came out to me :-) It was fun cuz I looooove her! She's my bestest friend in the whole wide world and I'm so happy I'm not alone anymore! Love you baby girl!

Bad News... Sr. Franny is ready to kick me out of the musical because she's nasty and no one likes her, and she needs someone to pick on, and I'm guessing I'm the easiest target.
Alex is really depressed because he's in love with me and he thinks he's gonna lose me. He's like ""I don't want you dating someone else, I don't wanna lose you!""
I'm having trouble with Joshua. He has yet to call me and sheenat, and it's really getting on my nerves, because it's like he doesn't even give a crap about me. He's just sitting at home, playing video games, waiting for me to call him so he can come down here and get laid. .. Talk about your local sex fiend.

.... Hmmm no one's ever replied to my posts. Someone gimme a comment :-)

"event","Well, I'm gonna begin with...  I made the background :-)   And my bestest friend, Sammy Ferraro made my lil Kelly Clarkson icon! We're both so.. creative lol!  As you can tell, I have a strong obsession with Kelly Clarkson... because she's freaking awesome! There are other American Idols I like (Clay, Tamyra, RJ, Diana... to name a few), but Kelly's my favorite. She's like, an inspiration to me to continue working on my vocal abilities so I can be on American Idol someday.

School's lame... I hate it! Midterms are this coming week, and I'm terrified. Honestly, I don't anything about anything. This year I feel so stupid since my grades have dropped considerably lower than they were last year.

On the brighter side, I got to see Joshua (my lovely boyfriend) yesterday! We saw Meet The Fockers. ... Funny movie! Not the funniest, but it was pretty funny. Barbra Streisand is actually a very good actor (and singer, might I add lol). Kelly Clarkson's better! Woot!!!

Hmm... me and my friend Erin were talking about funny things... K here's a little (yet, kinda lame now that I've thought about it like a bazillion times...) part of a convo we had:
Me: L, M, N, O, P... Q? What starts with a Q?
Erin: Cute? [Realizes] ... Wait that's a C... I think.
Me: Yeah, Erin... other wise that'd be Qute.
Ok, not that funny, but that's one of those ""had to be there"" moments.

Hmm, what else? I'm Mr. MacAfee in OLSH's Bye Bye Birdie musical. K that's just awesome! ... And I realised, it's so hard for me to act like myself as a character, but it's so easy for me to act as something I'm not, like pissed off Mr. MacAfee. K weird.

Sammy Ferraro's my hero just cuz he's my bestest friend in the whole wide world... though... SAMUEL... made mistakes lol... (I'm still mad Sammy!!!) I still love him cuz he's learned from them... one of like three true friends I have that did learn from their mistakes.    <3 Sammy lol

.... Well, I'm outtie... Mumsey-poo wants to go bowling now, so yay I get to kick her ass!! Her sorry '135' average is gonna be crushed by my '180' average. :-)

*~* Love you Joshy *~*"

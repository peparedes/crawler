"event","Ok so I haven't been around in a while, I've been working....sue me.... Anyway, so the new job: It's been going great. I'm going to quit my other one to stay here though. So back to why my subject is what it is....Ignorant people. This girl I work with @ Pacific Sunwear came into Bohemian when I was working the other night, and we're really good friends ya know? She looks at me and doesn't say a word or make an acknowledgement of me until I say hi and wave at her a few minutes later. When I did that she gave me this wave and an eat shit and die look. Friends don't just randomly give you that look. So I really didn't think anything of it, but I walked up to her a few more minutes later and asked her what was wrong and this is waht she said: ""Because you got a fucking job here and I'm 4 months older than you."" Makes sense right? not to me....it was probably the stupidest reason to ever be pissed off. It's not like I was trying to screw her over and steal a job she wanted. I didn't even fill out an application, they told me they wanted to hire me. I don't decide who get's hired there. I certainly didn't hire myself. So that is my complaint of the week. People are ignorant, and childish. I just don't understand how a good friend can make such a big deal out of something that small? oh well what can you do? It doesn't matter because I know for a fact that she won't ever get hired there, and I got that fact re-enforced by several others. I have driving school tomorrow so I'm going to bed."

More money and less time. Give and take a little, no pain no gain, can't have your cake and eat it too. Or however all those philosophies go. So my boyfriend is out of town and I'm bored and lonely :(, and I'm trying to behave, but I think I can handle it. So it's almost Wednesday so I'm going to bed. I'm out kids."

We did try to find an old abandoned insane asylum, but we all chickened out and didn't go...not b/c it was scary... because we didn't want any cops to pull up. (My friend got pulled over earlier today before that....) My birthday is Friday, and I'm so excited! big ole18...woop woop....yeah....whatever....

You know how you usually stay in touch with someone, and you and that person have been friends for a long time ( we're talking years) and even though they moved away you managed to still talk, but when they come back and you actually see each other it's cool..........THEN when you call them to see what's up after that they never answer? Yeah that really pisses me off. And when they do answer their phone...I'm going to chew them out for being a dickhole. Oh well what can you do about people?

She has already made it harder by withdrawing me from the University I was formerly enrolled in for the fall semester of this year, and now I have to hurry and find another one to go to. College or not this next semester, I will have a place to live for cheap. I only have to pay Utilities. I can just start college in the spring. Anywhoo....the problem today is....oh wait....what's the problem everyday? MY MOM! Everytime I come back in the door from being somewhere she yells at me for something, or she tells me she tired of me being here and can't wait until I get out, and she won't miss me. Given, I don't really like my mother that much....she is still my mother, and somewhere in me I do love her. So it tears into me a lot when she says things like that. I'm on the edge of insanity already people lets not push me over. I've been on a steady downfall because of her verbal abuse. But lets not go into a whole pity story because I hate it when people pity me, plus I hate dragging things out like those people that want so much attention. So I took this fake plastic baby home today called ""baby think it over"" it cries like a real baby, blah blah blah and all that stuff, and you have to have a key to put in its back unitl it beeps then you ""feed"" it or whatever you're supposed to do. Well....it has NOT stopped crying. It will cry every 5 minutes then for about an hour it will stop and for the next 3 or 4 hours it will cry eveyr 5 minutes again.....God help me...I mean God Save The Queen....wait....whatever.

Millions of decisions are racing through my head and millions of ""what if's"" are coming to mind. I have set my life around my friends but sometimes I need time away from them, but not the completely alone time (that's a whole other thing going on) the time that I can spend with someone to talk about anything and everything. To talk about problems. I need time to not go out and party with my friends like I have been doing every weekend. I feel a void in my life b/c I don't have that one person who I can call anytime if something randomly comes up. Why am I so sad? I guess it's one of those really depressing days."

Then after all their crap i told them I asked a biracial guy to prom, who is a very good friend of mine. Well, they freaked out and think i want to date an marry a black guy because they are super racist and now they think everywhere I go and everything I do and everyone I hang out with is bad. So now I'm getting pulled into this war. Well where is the person I talk to these things about? Oh he's here back in town, b/c he had a bad car wreck and had to come back, but his girlfriend who for some apparent reason hates me is at his house EVERY day now, which I understand b/c otherwise she doesn't see him he's in ATL. Still he is my ex and still good friend b/c he knows me so well and everything about me so I can talk to him about anything and everything and not feel weird about it. Because he already knows the background. ANyway off of that subject. I am now once again left dateless for the prom, so who could I take? I have NO clue.

My friend/ex who was in a car wreck is doing better. He is getting tired of his girlfriend now, muahahaha. Maybe that's a sign that we might in a slight chance tie up loose ends and bring back old times? Who knows, it would be nice though, I would be a lot happier, it's up to him however, if he wants to be friends we can be friends, but the feelings will always be there. Right now I'm working on the oh so wonderful photography project! I'm taking pics for a comic book about Jay and Silent Bob using their action figures! Woot wOoT! Oh well I decided I was on crack today while I was sitting in the tanning bed thinking ""What the hell am I going to do with my life?"" and ""Where am I going to find a prom date!....damn it I want cheesecake!"" I definitely need to lay off the nose candy....If I did it that is. Well I'm afraid I have to retire for the night folks, I know it's been about a week, but I have little spurts with lots of drama and then boredom follows! l8rs!"

"event","Monday blues. It happens to the best of us. ESPECIALLY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS! I'm telling you all, I'm sooo glad I only have 3 more months of this hell left. Then it's off to the good ole college world without having to see cheerleaders and the ruling group everyday. Because there no one gives a shit who you are, except your friends. Anywhoo. I don't really have a way to describe my day because I was out of it all day. I didn't see anyone because I don't feel like being social at all. My phone is turned off, and I didn't say a word at school except for asking my friend about her date with my other friend yesterday. They are so cute! Like newlyweds! YAY!. Ok I leave you with what came out of my thoughts today:  
     Oh let's bomb the factory that makes all the wannabes. Let's burst all the bubbles that brainwash the masses. Believing in nothing makes life so boring. So let's pray for something to feel good in the morning. Oh doctor we're dying, there's no use in crying. So live for tomorrow, and do what you have to. As far as I can tell it doesn't matter who you are. If you can believe there's something worth fighting for. The color of an eye, the glory of a sudden view. The baby in your arms, the smile he always shoots at you. So let's pray for something to believe in in the morning."

"event","The other day my very good friend and ex-boy friend got into a very bad car wreck, punctured lung, severed liver, broken bones, a bunch of shit. So I call my best friend Alexis, who I haven't been getting along with like I usually do lately, and I'm freaking out telling her he's in ICU. Well a couple of days later I find out she told her brother I said he died. My friend Clint comes up to me saying that her brother told my good friends girlfriend of the time now, who hates me anyway because I hear what she says about me, but I still have no clue who she is so whatever I really don't care, so Alexis brother told his girlfriend what Alexis said I told her. And that sucks because I had to go back and fix that and then yell at Alexis. Then I find out later that day that I can't go to prom with my date b/c his girlfriend is freaking out about us going together. This guy is like a brother to me. It's neither his or his girlfriend's prom, it's my senior prom and I wanted him to go with me but he had to be kind of an ass about that whole thing. I am so sick of Drama I'm just going to climb into a hole until everyone else in the world blows up so they can leave me alone and quit causing madness in my life. Oh by the way yesterday I find out ALexis is telling a good friend of mine Garrett that I am scandalous and I spread rumors.....what the fuck?  I hate drama like I said, and people who want to start drama spread rumors. I am not that type of person. I think last time I checked Alexis was spreading shit about me. I will tell you one thing. High school is the gayest thing ever, and I think we should rid of it because people do this whole little elementary thing of spreading rumors or getting their friends to tell you what they were going to tell you. Or they talk about you behind your back. In the real world you can't just go find somebody in the hallway and talk shit, you have to tell that person. Face it high schoolers, you all suck, I should've dropped out and gotten a GED and gone to college a LONG time ago."

"event","Ok so I thought about everything with my friend. I think it would be better if we stayed friends, just because. There's less of a vulnerable feeling, I won't feel like I'm not as protected or loved if this is all kept quiet. If we keep our relationship how it is now, it will continue to be a great one. Anwhoo....I did find a really hott date for prom. and I'm looking foward to seeing him today and making up for what I missed on Valentine's Day. ;P oh yeah. I'm telling you if you saw this guy. When I update my pictures I'll make sure our prom pic is on there. I found out my best friend that deserted me is now talking shit about me, her not being one to have room to talk. SO....she is saying I get around. That's a big no. I'm not saying I'm a goody goody bible beater. I do have a sex life.....but sex life doesn't mean sex itself. Whatever happened to just some foreplay for fun b/c you're not sure you want to fuck that many people? And it's not like I do that with everyone I see. She's been around with more guyz than me so I mean WTF? I don't go around talking about her. Let's just say she's getting a huge piece of my mind tomorrow. Anyways, other than that I am having the greatest day ever.....or a good day at least. I did have something disturbing come up last night. I was on the phone with my friend and my ex beeps in. He says he has a poem to read me for Valentine's day even though it's late. Well I thought it couldn't do any harm so I won't hang up (bastard cheated on me a lot) So I listen and it starts out all Roses are red Violets are blue.......blah blah blah but then it goes, baby I'm horny when I'm with you, eat me, bite me, do things that are nasty or something like that that's when I just went into shock b/c I felt really violated. I mean that is just fucking gross. If you are going to write a poem write something less graphc, for real. You suck at poems asshole. and then I hang up. But oh well, everyone has stalkers right? oh well."

"event","Ok, So friday was Valentine's Day. And of course the whole day I see couples walking around all happy. Not to say I wasn't happy Friday, I was, I just want someone to give me flowers and candy, and er....maybe a piece. But here's the thing. I spent Valentine's day with my good guy friends and mainly Casey. Well not just Friday, the whole weekend. We ended up driving around for a while b/c it was storming and plans were delayed, and told each other our life-stories, the long version. Getting into that we got into relationships, and after seeing his views on them, I'm beginning to like him....ACK! What do I do? I'm not sure. I dated his good friend, and he specifically stated because of that he couldn't ever date me, he didn't say it to me though, he said it to someone on the ohone, but I was sitting there. I don't like him b/c of his pimped out car, or money, or anything like that. He's always been a very attractive person to me, but I didn't let that give me a physical attraction along with the emotional one. It's just that after hearing is straight up honest views on things, most of them I completely agree with, and he is the type of guy I am looking for. Someone who will be there, who cares, but isn't attatched to your hip all the time. I love spending time with him, and I love his sense of humor. I can be myself completely around him, and I'm comfortable with it. The problem is how do I tell him this, or should I even tell him? ya know? I feel a little weird keeping this bottled up around him, but it doesn't affect how I act when were hanging out. RAWR!! AH! I give up on relationships, l8rz"

"event","Have you ever had the feeling where you were just totally alone? Not like alone where no one understands your problems, I don't usually tell everyone my life story in a drawn out way, only a select few people. It's when you're just sitting at home and you can't get in touch with anyone, and you feel like a loser? I know It's Tuesday night, who the hell is going to be home? Maybe it's b/c I feel like my best friend betrayed me because she spends too much time with her better half? I don't know. I now realize I was spending too much time with her and helping her deal with her problems than I was with myself, or my other friends for that matter, so now I  find myself feeling like an ass for neglecting them, and trying to make up for it. They aren't mad at me maybe only frustrated. I'm not making sense here, b/c I'm just thinking not explaining it really. The point is, My best Friend...Alexis, is completely neglecting me now that she's with Dylan. Why do I know for sure? He lives 3 houses down from me, she's over there everyday, and can't even have the consideration to at least drop by not for long just to say hey. So I'm left baffled at what to do. We did everything together, every weekend or break from school we were together 24/7 literally, she stayed at my house or I stayed at hers. I'm really confused right now. Stop the babbling and leave...leaving......leaving now."

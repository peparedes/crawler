"event","Today, it was like I was struck with lightning.  I have been the BIGGEST bitch I've ever met to certain people, one in particular.  Why didn't anyone hit me!?!?! HOLD ME CLOSER TINER DANCER sorry couldnt resist.  Anyway, why hasn't anyone put me in my place!! I am SO SORRY, for those who have been afflicted by my own worthless issues that caused me to become such a hateful being.  I realize now that it is far to late to repair what I had, and I refuse to take you in particular away from your new happiness.  But Please believe me when I say that I am repented, and implore your forgiveness.

Thank you, my love.  That is all."

"event","His dreary pessimism funny
His aukward stance cute
Diggin' his grill and diggin' his loot
A queer choice, but I'll tell you honey
It was death in a suit
One thing to make my love ka-poot
Cause I dont care if live in books
Or fatter than a french cook
Its the fact that your a republican!
That takes away a second look."

"event","10 Reasons Why Gay Marriage is ""Wrong""
1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.

2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behaviour. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and
can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Brittany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans

Please post this in your journal if you are for gay marriage."

"event","Top reasons to love being irish:
1.) In our history, the women kicked Roman and every other kind of ass, complete equals to men in every way, were just as many in the army as men, and even led the armies in some cases.  Yeeeyah.

2.) We're allowed to be drunks

If you meant it dont take it back, and the ability to listen is way more valuable than the ability to talk.  But if you can only listen then you better talk before you explode, and if you only talk you better learn to listen beofor your self absorbed ass gets kicked.  It's amazing how sometimes all you want is someone to talk to, but when they show up you get aukward and can't; but at the same time, how can you expect someone to snap out of their silence just like that? Learn to understand, learn to hold, learn to listen, and then learn to cry away pride before you go a step further.

Harry Potter kicks ass, and Ron is getting with Hermoine you annoying pricks who try and say otherwise."

This kid keeps looking at me, I don't know who it is, but he's kind of cute.  Alison's boyfriend cheated on her, which is why he must die, the twins turned up not coming which made me very sad but they had to study so.  **Sigh** I am so bored, I want to go out and party."

"event","I am SO excited right now, I get to go to chillis with Vanessa and Ailis. For some odd reason I feel special and loved, but only God knows why.  Today in science Ben was talking to these kids about his political views.  Let me borrow this quote to explain: ""He opened his mouth, said little, and thought not at all"" 
I have NEVER heard more ignorant comments come from anyone.  Well maybe one or two people but he certainly takes the cake.  I've got a new e-mail address which excites me.  It's SunKitty129@hotmail.com, thanks Ailis for the hotmail idea.  I have gotten wicked fat recently, I need to start running.  If only my stomach weren't so large and annoying I could just stop eating and be done with it. i hate this.  Mason said that the typical irish person had red skin, and i wanted to smake him and be like well the average italian is fat and can't be understodd but I didn't.  Still pissed me off though."

"event","So the games started at 12:20 on thursday. Returning from lunch, my study hall watched the first set of games. Witchita State trashed Seton Hall and so i started 0-1. Boston College pulled out a close one in double overtime to give me a win. I went 11-5 on the first day, which wasn't very good but with the upsets, no one had great picks. Second day rolls around and I see that again more upsets occur and Kansas, who i had in the finals, had lost to Bradley. Saturday i was in Huntington North, wrestling in Cadet state finals (I went 1-2 blah). So today it is sunday....half of my sweet sixteen teams are gone and three of my final four teams are already...remember only in regionals still... are gone. Very depressing... i had no one seeds....so expected to be a little wrong (being a big fan of the underdog but the dogs under the underdogs are winning so yeah). I had two 4 seeds and one 5 seed and one 3 seed in the final four. Not gonna give team names but hey...i'd like to watch the witicha state and george mason game(who would have ever guessed...honsetly...has anyone ever heard of them before this tournament no...where are they from...friggin CUSA)
So right now i am doing a newspaper for english over the Odyssey and wtaching has my bracket fails more and more but at least the games are closeand good to watch. I'm out...

"event","So i never wrote about the half of my night from the last time i updated...o well...too bad. So i have asked a lot of questions lately that can't be answered and along with help from the wizard named Internet, i was able to compile some of the toughest questions ever. Answer them in the form of a comment...if you can.

Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?

Would a fly without wings be called a walk?

Why do they lock gas station bathrooms? Are they afraid someone will clean them?

Why do steam irons have a permanent press setting?

Can you be a closet claustrophobic?

Why do you need a driver's license to buy liquor, when you can't legally drink and drive?

Does the Postmaster General need a stamp of approval?

Why is the word abbreviation so long?

Is it possible to be totally partial?

What's another word for thesaurus?

If a book about failures doesn't sell, is it a success?

If the funeral procession is at night, do folks drive with their lights off?

When companies ship styrofoam, what do they pack it in?

If you're cross-eyed and have dyslexia can you read all right?

If a stealth bomber crashes in a forest, will it make a sound?

If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent?

If a parsley farmer is sued, can they garnish his wages?

If a turtle doesn't have a shell, is he homeless or naked?

When it rains, why don't sheep shrink?

Should vegetarians eat animal crackers?

Do cemetery workers prefer the graveyard shift?

What do you do when you see an endangered animal that eats only endangered plants?

Do hungry crows have ravenous appetites?

Why do people who know the least know it the loudest?

Tough questions..i know..answering them would be like when Kerry ran for presidency...pointless...but try

"event","So far my weekend has been weird and funny. Thursday night i went to the hitting streak and came home and played yahho pool for the rest of the night. I go to sleep and wake up the next morning around 1 or 2. I take a glorious shower while listening to some Wolf Parade which is a very neat band. I take my shower and then my dad and i head up to indy to see the first round of the indiana wrestling finals (i know why wasn't i wrestling in them..cough cough). So we give this kid a ride from turkey run up there cause he came with my aunt and this kid is weird. He has a speech impediment and just a goofy kid, i actually wondered if he had been to indianapolis before but still awkard and strange. So we get up there and watch all wrestling and left after nate hodges match. So we go home and we ate at steah n shake which was pretty good...i ate my food really fast. So i go home and go to sleep. I wake up and it's saturday, so i grabbed a pop-tart and a fudge round and took another amazing shower. I get dressed because i'm going up to indy again to see a band play. I'm getting ready and what not and so i go into the bathroom for some finishing touches ya know. I step into my cat's hairball....one of the most disguising steps i have ever taken in my life...so i'm pretty mad and so after punting and beating my cat, i decided to clean it off and so i do using a pressure hose which worked realy well. I smelled my shoes and they didn't smell like ralph so i was good to go. Levesque picked me up and with michael W and alex totheroh we went to this music store called Luna records...very neat place. And so we get in there and the band doesn't come in like another hour so we just hung out. So we look at some cds and then the band comes and they are called dios malos...they are very good...they have a song on the OC soundtrack called YOu Got ME All Wrong. So it was really cool because there wasn't a stage...they were just right there...talking with us and just bein themselves. They played about 6 or seven songs with just an acoustic guitar...a tamborine and a maraka or however it's spelled.But then the weirdness began but i'm tired of writing and so i'll post later.

"event","So i haven't written since wrestling in preseason and so i thought i'd give my most memborable wrestling moments.....in no certain order

1. Alex Higareda getting kicked off the team...he definetly put the REST in WRESTLING
2. Me receiving a nasty concussion(which now i have to wear a mouth guard for)
3. Korbin Shillings getting lateral dropped by Coach Ervin(fucking funniest thing ever)Ervin held nothing back...i could have walked under korbin...that was how high up he was
4. Hoff and Zach Hall trading fistcuffs and take downs....kind of a fight
5. The Spears fighting
6. Watching Mark Menard wrestle.....
7. Seeing Codey Spear and Derek Jackson sleep in the same bed
8. Seeing Haleigh Moore beat two kids...sweet..felt bad for the boys that lost though.....their penises must have shriveled up and fell off
9. Hearing stories from Uncle Hoff and Daddy Jaime
10. Going to regionals...that was fun....for the whole 40 seconds i wrestled....

That's all i can think of....i have tons more but they aren't coming to me at the moment

              Royce Altamirnoanraey (A mexican) was singing, "" I'll make love to you, like you want my to, and i'll hold you tight,"" and mr.miller finishes,"" We'll make tacos all night.
     Mr. Miller was in a very good mood today and made fun of a lot of people in the process. TOld a girl and ""her bad hairdo"" to turn around. TOld Brandon Clark not to kick a mexican while he's down. Over all a good today that will end at Johnny Provolones...you all will be there"

"event","SO  haven't updated in awhile, that could be do to a variety of these things homework, wrestling, long bouts of masterbation, deforestation, global warming, liberalism, the invention of gunpowder, women who feel the need to leave the iron board and start careers, and the Civil War. So yeah, i had a busy week. I woke up around 7:30 each day and made it to school feeling tired and miserable. But my day changes during seventh period. No, i don't run to the bathroom for a quick drag of a cigarette or joint but i enter mr. miller's room for study hall. He is one of the smartest and funniest persons i know. He has a come back for everything and it mostly depends on the stereotypes that pertain to. For example, on day mr. miller was giving us all assigned seats and he had everyone seperated and brandon clark...cough cough....was all by himself and mr miller say, "" You're okay aren't you brandon, since you hate white people."" Not funny to anyone that doesn't know mr. miller and brandon clkark both but hilarious to the ones so fortunate that do. I think i'm going to compile his best comebacks and put them into a book called the, "" Comeback Manifesto with Mr. Miller."" So today i'm in study hall...bored because Robert isn't there to talk to. SO i go over to mr. miller and we start talking. Jacob Corbin joins in and we have this nice, flowing conversation. I learned he has a dog named BarneyScooterRoy and he has been in 5 different colleges and has study various things. Mr. Miller has put one year into his docorate for history and told us the hole it put in his pocket. $27,000 he told us. Stunned, jacob wondered if he planned on returning and he said he did which lead to a famous quote, the funniest thing that i have ever heard. Mr miller replies, "" If i get into some money or find me a rich biatch."" Surprised a teacher would, "" biatch"" i bursted into laughter along with jacob and jezzy. I couldn't stop. THe more i said it over in my head the funnier it got and i was laughing so hard i began to do the silent laugh in which your breath is gone but you still laugh. I laughed for a good 5-10 minutes with jacob and just laughed even more everytime he repeated it. FUNNY. SO that was the day in a nutshell.... You stay classy...planet earth.

"event","Yeah i wrestle...so what, you wanna fight or something huh?...no no just joking. But i'm not that stereoypical wrestle. Yes i have a neck and no it's not thick and brut like. I also don't act all bad ass cause i wrestle...just not cool if you do that. I'm not a very violent person but when it's for sport it's fair so ya know.......bitches. Speaking of swearing, chrissy and i had a crazy cussing war. YOu need to read at http://www.livejournal.com/users/janet09 ( and yes chrissy i'll need money for advertising that). I'm not much of a swearer but i'll insult you in ways you thought that couldn't be done in the english language. If its a girl, i usually go for the whore and slut type of deal. ANd i used that in my most recent face off with chrissy. I don't know about guys cause i haven't squared off with one yet but if you want to challenge the keeper of the f-bomb than you can go ahead and do it...you got my messenger name. SO yeah just check out chrissy's journal and see what i'm all about. I read the comments and a lot of people have never seen me swear. CAuse i can't really swear cause i'm frggin 5' 2"" but waht can you do...am i right. So later y'all."

"event","so today was a pretty ordinary day.I had a test in bio which sucked, but i'm feelin confident about it so that makes me happy. Speaking of veatch and bio, pat garrett and kwortek come in her class all the time during our hour and 've never actually seen them do anything but they are hilarouis. SO they com in the other day and grabbed the TV and took it some where. THey come like 15 minutes later with red faces like they have been laughing pretty hard and so they were putting the TV back and asked out class if we wanted to screen their movie for bio2 and of course we all said yes. Amazon woman, after many and many pleads said yes, she's cool like that sometimes. THe movie starts out it is in black and white and the excorcism theme song is playin and the camera is goin through the empty halls of Ben Hur nursing home. I'm cracking up because of the anticipation. SO the camera cuts a corner and kwortek is dressed up as a priest and is standing over tacowho is lying on a couch( like kwortek is gonna do an excorcism on taco to get rid of his tapeworms). SO the camera gets TAco in it's view and taco just squirms around for like 5 minutes. If you have ever seen family guy you will get me. so then they fast forward through some stuff and it's back to color again and the camera is zoomed in on a door. THe camera then changes to this like heat vision mode and it is layered with this gospel singer singing and slow mo. And out pops jesus(corbin houston)...i friggin lost it and if totheroh was there he too would have gone nuts. SO then jesus tells us the good word and that the tapeworms aren't the ones killing people and then a ninja dressed pat pops up and shanks jesus' holy figure. SO then jsesu chases the ninja down outside and they spar off and decide to trade fistacuffs. THe mortal kombat voice comes over and says ""FIGHT"" and the music for mortal kombat starts playing( losing it again)...a staff is thrown to jesus and he shows off some flashy moves and then the ninja gets back with his amazing skills. SO they start fighting it looks really good..like old kung fu movies. ANd so his holiness ends up winning which makes me think how the jews must feel(yeah i know...essin with religions). so that was pretty cool...then to end it, kwortek and jesus are at a bar and kwortek orders a drink and then jesus orders water...( jesus can turn water into wine...get it) so then kwortek says ,"" sweet,free booze"" and that's the end. THe editing on it was amazing and i learned that if tapeworms every get into my body...a staff wielding jesus will come to my rescue to battle off unwanted ninjas. THen after the movie kwortek drew this picture of mrs. veatch hanging her self because kwortek just broke up with her and a third armed pat was in the mix and an apple. SO yeah...check the movie out."

"event","So this is live journal...nice. YOu know i'd always enjoyed people's journals and just never wanted to make my own but for some reason i did it today. TOday was pretty sweet you know. I got a haircut and so now it's a lot shorter than it used to be but it's out of my eyes and way so that is cool. J.D. Roberts makes my friggin day. Today he came to my lunch table which consists of dylan,reuben,j.d. rice, alex(he wasn't therre today because of surgery on his gangling), linn, brad, klajdi, and sam, and tanner. So he comes up and asks what are you thankful for. Thjis of course being for the newspaper which probably the funniest piece of writing released month after month. And so klajdi say , being in america."" It was funny we always ngive him a hard time about being from europe or africa or asia...hell i don't know where he is from..just playin. THen j.d. asks what do you like to eat for thanksgiving and jacob corbin said,"" babies."" The table freakin erupted with laughter and i was about to spray my dannon water with fluoride all over the place. THen someone else said vagina and that was good for giggles at least. ANd then he asked about our opnions on indian assimulation( it something to do with the way we americanized indians and gave them reservations). And so tanner says""...i'm pretty pissed...they can build gambling places on their land."" Then i said..."" it's pretty cool that we could bash the democracy in them(as a joke)..but they are alright..they got those little pueblos"" so that was the highlight of the day."

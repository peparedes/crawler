Every time I'm around both of them I feel like I'm at court and the attorney is asking me questions. Depending on my answers ones going away. I hate myself for wanting my parents to get divorced but I'm tired of hearing there shit. If Dad stays around I know that next month I'll be back in the same spot, But if they separate finally I might have a chance to leave this hellhole or at least improve my life some. These are terrible times we live in, my grandmama got hit by a drunk driver a few months back and nows a vegetable. The Fucker got away with it and only had to pay about 15k for the entire thing. Fuck that. Now that I remember the my old folks my grandpapa is not looking so well but its mostly his fault. He just won't listen to the Docs. I need to escape or at least for someone to come rescue me. And I guess the good news is, I'm the healthiest I've been since I was 16! w00t! And I have a pet now to. A kitten that I named Foxy. Shes a bitch."

A hate that kept me up at night. The type that has filled every moment. This hate I have carried for a long time and will always carry. I hate for him for his actions. His attitude. His weakness. Everything. He went to jail last year on x-mas, now this year on thanksgiving. He knows how to fuck my world up, and hes done a damn good job. I feel lost now, scared of what is to come. Even though I hate him, I still depend on him. I'm actually kinda scared on whats going to happen. Part of my life will be decided tommorow. Will I rise or fall."

"event","The days seem longer when your tired. I barely got any sleep due to this devil rash which is in fact poison ivy. All day people have been asking me if I've been in a fight and I just stare at them laugh and say yeah that was fun. I went with Ryan and pepito plus some other chaps of ryans to the movies. The hamiltons. Yeah its pretty much party of five vampire stlye. Not god at all. I came home and pased out on the couch for a couple hours and then relized I lost my cellyfone. I need sometime apart from it anyway. I found out hw to stop the itchy. Really hot water. Yeah it feels so weird. And for a final note. My lips have been numb all day now and its starting to bug me abit. Numb. Strange word."

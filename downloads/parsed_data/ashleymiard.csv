"event","the truth is everything sucks and everything is lame. its amazing how a couple years of your life that should have been erased by now still haunts you every day. not a day goes by that i dont think about everything that happend last summer. the things i wanna forget most are the things i often think about. i just wanna move away by myself and meet new people, in a new town start off fresh. but then i think that would just be running away from my problems. i cant even think about when the last time i was actually happy cause it was sooo long ago. if this is wut depression is like i think i have it. i act happy on the outside but really im lying to myself and others when they ask me if everything is okay and i say yes when really everything is horrible. its hard to explain everything that i've been feeling latley and thinking about...i had a really good talk last night with curtis and he gave me alot of really good advise. i like talking to him casue hes so wise yet so young, he knows exactly how i feel and it just makes it so much easier to talk to him.."

"event","<P>im going to victoria tomorrow thank god. i need to get away from this place for a few days. things have sucked latley. i hate how people are so judgemntal towards people they dont even know and how they talk shit about someone when there proably way cooler and a way better of a person then that person will ever be. im so sick of highschool and im fucking glad its almost over cause i couldnt stay another year...or even another 3 months. everythings going to fall apart when school is over though which im not looking forward to. everyones going to go their seprate ways and&nbsp;do wutever and people always say your never going to stay friends with your highschool friends. i really hope that doesnt happen...well in the case of some people that is...im so glad that me and jaz become close this year. shes such an amazingly kewl friend. and i dont care wut you think!!!!! i think i just need a change. i need to get our of the school most tho...because of all of the memories that linger in the hallways. i need to forget my past and realize that it will never be the same and i think getting out of that place will help me. i hate the memories that i want to get rid of, but seem to be the only thing i ever think of. what a bad feeling it brings. fuck fuck fuck you you you...i want to get my tattoo now. its so amazing. i love it. i cant wait. i wish i didnt care so much i wish i could tell what i feel when i feel, to the person i am mad at but i cant. i have problems with telling people how i feel and i really need to change it especially at times like this. i think its casue im afraid that the person i tell things to wont care, which would be worse than a kick in the face or just pretends like they dont know what your tlaking about and then i have to question myself and make sure its not me...fuck i make life so much more difficult that it actually is. sometimes i wish i never met you. i hate how your a hypocryte and you dont even realize it. i hate how you always have to be right and even if your not you convince yourself you are. i hate how you dont care about me anymore, i hate how you dont make time for me anymore and most of all i hate how i care soo fucking much and you could care less...and its sad that you dont even realize any of this casue your to caught up with everything else around you...</P>
<P>yes, it is happening again...</P>"

"event","I'm tuggin' at my hair
I'm pullin' at my clothes
I'm tryin to keep my cool
I know it shows

I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words inside my head

I'm feeling nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it--yeah

If I could say what I wanted to say
I'd say I want to blow you--away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I wanted to see
I want to see you go down--on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishing my life away
With these things I'll never say

It don't do me any good it's just a waste of time
What use is it to you what's on my mind
If ain't comin out we're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care"

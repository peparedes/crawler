"event","<strong>so here's the thing. i've grown ridiculously exhausted of the following things:</strong>

- people who all look the same
- pretentious music tastes for status in some invisible club called the ""scene""
- pseudo photographers
- girls who are more occupied with what music boys like and what those boys wear than what they have to say.
- shitty hardcore bands
- shitty dance bands
- fake myspace friends
- myspace/aim/lj being my main means of communication
- girls who lead guys on to make themselves feel loved
- guns and bandanas and girls jeans and x's and black shirts
- kids with no heart/creativity/motivation/unique ideas
- the people who fall in love with the kids mentioned above
- kids who claim to hate the scene but are everything that the scene has become.
- attention whores and name droppers
- pseudo graphic designers
- shitty ideals that kids will grow out of within a year
- jumping on trends that are just as bad and temporary as any trend you'll find on mtv
- fashion
- people who seem to have forgotten where they came from and how they got into this culture, so they demean anyone who came from the same place.
- hipsters
- hypocrisy
- the internet
- being rejected by girls who claim i'm so amazing, but would rather have the above things.
- obsessions with the 80's from people who were 3 during them.
- people who use every single aspect of their life to make their status in this scene better.
-<strong> but most of all, i hate that i've somehow got caught in this viscous web, myself.</strong>

<big><b>we all laugh at what we already were.</b></big>

thank you so much to everyone who ever took the time out to read this journal and make a comment or for even thinking about commenting. to think that people actually care about reading about my life is amazing.

<strong>if i love you</strong>, you'll know where to find me.

"event","yah currently it is early as fuck in the morning and me and zev are taking shifts on sleeping bc we both ahve to study our ass's off for Hollars damn tests. yah zev's only got about 5 more minutes left. yah tonites gonna be an all nighter or close to it.
ok so yah this weekend was an awesome time and in the spirit of meghan if anyone says it wasnt ""i'll cut your face!"" yah it was apo sectionals this weekend and it was a better time than i would have ever thought. this sectional was a really imprtant one cause the section is being split oin half. Translation: a very emotional banquet. but yah it was a great time to meet all the brothers from around the state and actually find out a lot more about the fraternity than i would have ever thought. it was also a big bonding experience between our own chapter. it really gave us a chance to come together and get to really know eachother. in other words i am really glad that i went instead of staying home and studying even though i am paying for it right now like a stupid mother fucker. ehhh but it was worth it. well bitches it is finally time for me to get some sleep and finally time for zev to get his ass up. layta"

"event","yesterday was beautiful, granted i studieds almost the whole day inside but still it was beautiful. and right now what is it doing outside? yah thats right it is snowing. gosh this shit is supposed to go away. anywyas im over it. 

so yah after waking uo this morning about 3 times, the last and final time i woke up in a frantic panic because i only had 25 min to get to class and had a quiz that i still didnt study for in philosophy at 10 am. so i wake uo and fling my blaket opff and my phone falls off the loft into a bunch of shit under merediths bed. yah well when i went to look for it i only found 2 pieces of the bloody thing. so it was a bd start to an already shitty day. but thankfully i chesked in the garbage and found the battery in the bottom of a full basket of trash. yuck. i guess im just glad that i still have the piece of shit.

but yah on the lighter note i cant wait for easter. some good home cooked food and family and my own bed. gosh that sounds so good. 

i've come to the conclusion that after i am a dermatologist and all i am gonna get the hell out of this state and move myself to tbeh beaches of californ-i-a. hell yah bitches."

"event","even though i may bitch about the homelife or have some really f-ed up story to tell about it, i have come to find that i do miss it. it is great ti be back and see all the old friends from high school and just hang out like we used to. i really really miss that. last night was a great time hanging out wiht the old girlfirends and it reminded me of just how much i love them and that no matter what happens a good girl friend is always there for you. its a really good feeling when you can hang out with people for the first time and months and still feel like you have been there the whole time. well i love them and have reminded me of how much i really do enjoy being home.

on the other hand as i continue to think about it, shallow people continue to get shallower. i guess through out life one will run into all sorts of people, good and bad. it is all part of the experience but it is truly ones own choice in picking who they surround themsleves with. just hopefully looking back in the end we will know that we have made the right choice."

"event","So right now is spring break. Back from the D and in the Twp currently. it is weird cause i feel like i am on a vacation to like another state or country or something. Not only do i ahve to pack all my stuff up but the change of atmosphere is crazy. It's like i am in culture shock in my own culture. I dunno if i could really explain that one to ya. 

The UDM basketball teams, mens and womens, are truly awesome. both teams made it to the Horizon League tournamant. the men made it all the way to final game that if they would have won it they would have played in the NCAA. But unfortunately they lost by 1 point. how crappy is that not only for the school, but especially the players. yah and just to let everybody know the people from wisconsin are a bunch of dicks. they really dont have a ny sportsmanship or class at all. but yah if i ahvent told you already the pep-band traveled with the teams to play in the stands and support them while playing in the tournament. we went to wisconsin and then to ohio. it was so much fun. it beats out nay of the trips so far. not only was it free to go and we got payed but we could do whatever we wanted when ever we wanted. this includes going to the bars and going clubbing and which by the way none of them turned out quite as planned. besides some small little set backs the trip was seriously the best. i am looking forward to next years. yessssss!

so now it is weds. morning and i have just gottne back from the disappointing game in wisconsin with a 14 hour bus ride round trip. it is crazy i ahve been gone pretty much since last thursday but it seems like only a couple days have gone by. as much as i want to go back to school and see everyone i dont want break to end. i miss being at home and just having time to just ""do nothing"" or even just see the old gang from high school. yet college is one of the greatest things thta one can experience. the freedom, responsibility, the people, the friends, the parties, gosh i could keep on going. no matter how much i bithc about college and how i just want to drop out and be a garbage man i really do love it.

oh yah and this journal is looking pretty boring and nasty so i gotta get to some decorating.

"event","You don't know what you got 'til it's gone.
Just be thankful for the people that you have around you. Cherish them. Value every moment. My heart goes out to all those in need and i pray for you.

Me, Mer mer and G went out to thai food with my mumma tonite. But instead of going to the best thai place ever (Bangkok Cuisine)we went to the fast food thai place across the street. i guess bangkok is remodeling. so the food was good i guess for what it was (fast food thai). then sadly we ahd to be dropped back off to the shitpile to return to do homework. yuck.

but on a lighter note spring break for me is in 2 days and if u want to be all technical it is one. i am gonna travel with the pepband to play for the basketball team. dude, i dont even care about the games i just cant wait to hang at the hotel and all. but i do hope that the team wins a good amount of the games and all.

alrite i'm out."

"event","so i thought this snow was supposed to melt and it was supposed to get warmer and all that. well i guess not seeing as how when i got out of lab it was snowing like a mother.
well last night was a lot of fun. i ahvent talked to this one person for awhile and last night we had a great time just chilling and watching t.v. this person also helped me get over some issues that have been eating away at me for a little while. it was good just to get it all out and just talk about it. it is a load off my shoulders and i thank them very much for this.
this weekend is home coming weekend and yes i know this is weird compared to when we had it in high school. but i think it is gonna ba a lot of fun. plus i have to play a ton for pep band. 
speaking of high school, many people say that they are glad that it is ove and are so happy to get awya from those people. and to that i would have to partially agree but then there are the people that a re alos slipping away that you would like to not let go of. but i guess if the friendships and stuff are meant to be then they will last. but alright gotta do the h.w.
peace bitches."

"event","so wow it has been a while. hah yah out of my other two journal entries.<yah i really don't know what the f that was.

Anyways, a word of advice to all, and yes i know that i give a lot of those yadda yadda yadda but whatever. Ok when you have a gut feeling or a strange inner sense about something do the world and definately yourself a favor and follow it. because in the end it will save you a lot of pain, embarrassment or whatever it may be and you will be thankful for this. i get these gut feelings but always manage to go against them. i guess i should really start taking my own advice and stop being a dip shit. 

Lately (meaning this semster) i have managed to unitentionally hurt some people (i dont mean physically, i leave that to meredith.). these people are great and nice and wonderful people and i ahve managed to just pretty much take a shit on their feelings. i am very sorry for this. and while doing this, i sit hear with a major frickin headache, some major anger, embarrassment, and a hurt feeling inside because this same thing was done to me. i now know how it feels and i wouldn't wish this upon anyone.

layta bitches."

"event","Ok i guess some things have come out of the 80's that were decent per say, the rubics cube and Mtv and ok thats about it. That decade has mass produced a bunch of people particularly my age, grade class or whatever that suck. This is all according to my professor. According to her, our class has achieved the awesome position of having the lowest test scores of all her classes in the last decade. This was a definate boost to the confidence of the class and even furthers the idea that this is why everybody does not become doctors.  

Ok i am done bitching. heh yah right for all of those that know me. but i guess in the end it will turn out.

p.s. Happy Birthday! and have fun."

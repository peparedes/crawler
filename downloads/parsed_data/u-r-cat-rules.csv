Welcome Back...

"event","It sucks, I know...  But I also know we can do this.  I can see it in everyone and so could he.  Everything he made us do came from us, he pulled it out of us.  Everything is still there.  The only thing we've lost is the voice being there and telling us to pull it out and do what we know we can.  Now we have to be that voice for ourselves and for each other.  We can and will be the best Regiment ever.  Think what he would want, he didn't want to go, but he had to.  Would he want us to abandon our potential and stagnate because we don't have him there to push us.  NO, he would want us to go on without skipping a beat, just the way he trained us.  I love you all, and I am here for you all.  I trust in you and hope that you can trust in me as well.  Eric will always be there watching us somehow, as Chris said-- there are videotapes.  He will see what we do, what are we going to show him?"

Though I dont seem to have perfected that art of reason.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  Maybe we aren't all good people always and we're able to out run the karmatic train, but not forever.  Even the ""best"" person who engages in the ""best"" actions is stepping on someones toes.  Maybe we're not meant to be dynamic, after all we tend to be static in the end.  I just write, I don't think so please excuse any incomprehensibleness."

No.  But is it really possible to die without a single regret?  What is life but a series of mistakes that ultimately lead to the lives we lead and the people we become?  So perhaps my ""regrets"" aren't really regrets.  I really do like the person I have become so I guess all those decisions I regret having made or all the opportunities I've missed isn't a bad thing.

So, I don't write often because I feel pretty clumsy, but this came to me in English and TOK today, and I sorta like it.  So here it is...

Two lives, One world
Different paths that chanced
     to meet

A day so ordinary
Suddenly extaordinary
     and you

Life seemed so real,
     so bright
And now, without you
The same seems
     trivial and dim

My soul drive becomes
     you
My soul destruction becomes
     you

Nothing can satiate my
     desire
My need

Isn't love beautiful?

We've got some Simon and Garfunkle, I've been smoking to much weed (opium), and some awesome song that i dunno who it is by.  Today was much happiness, I finally got my hair cut!  Its all shorter and less wiley, and it smells good because of my nummy gel.  Today was a good day for history, I could see it all folding out right there in front of me, all I wanted to do was shout ""STOP, stop you stupid idiots--why on earth?""  OMG stupid people and watching the Titanic, much like the Dreadnought.  Then my Metamorphosis essay, and I think I rambled and almost maybe answered the question.  Then Chem, we got out early and went to Sarah and Jenny.  Haloween is a funny holiday, all sorts of odd people at school today.  I think Sarah wins thought for her Katinka costume,  she was even starting to get the hang of the accent.  Then dinner, yummy and yeah for making decisions, I hope you approve.  What a view, theres the airport, and Colfax, and so much more.  SS Fear God, blue, white, silver, teak.  And cars and cold and warm and wind.  I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable at all, but thank you--thank you for being there with me.  Since last time you didnt miss much, 6th place, thats about it... yay Austin Powers.
Much Love,

But the when they leave I get really sad and want them to stay, but what do I really offer them to stay?  Nothing.  I guess it just boils down to is that I just like having company, even if we arent talking, just knowing that there is someone on the otherside of the screen that I could talk to makes me feel safe.  Its the samething when I'm at home, even if they are in a completely different place in the house, just knowing they are there makes me feel safe.
Today was pretty normal, at least for me.  We played a game in French, but it was horribly boring and my team lost.  Math was a waste of time, as usual, I'm sure we might actually do somthing someday.  Music theory was interesting, learning all of these things I probably ought to have at least some knowledge of.
Practice was practice, nothing really exciting happened today, #4 was gone again, and I wanted to kill Left-side, but that's not surprising sometimes.  I don't really like Alex I've decided, he's a pretty cool guy and all, but as a tech I think he really isn't that great.  He cant organize thoughts well enough to really tell us what our problemes are, or how to fix them.  And he says that some things make us look like ""ametures(sp?)"" well, we are... I'm sorry we aren't the Blue Knights.
I wish the day was longer and that we all needed about 2 hours less sleep.  I wish we all had more time together, but especially during the week when I really need to talk and spend time with people to keep my sanity it seems like there is less and less time everyday.  I think thats how we all feel...
The grip was tighter today, or mayber my hands were weaker today, but either way we didn't have enough time.  I would give almost anything to be back at Addenbrooke again, just letting the world spinning around me and feeling ""specialness"" beyond all specialness.  I've never wanted to just stand in someone's arms as much as I do yours, I feel so safe and warm, even on a cold night, brutally exposed to the world.  I wonder sometimes why I feel this way about you, its like everything isn't different, but just right and just how it's always been. (as you've said)

"event","Have you ever...
-Noticed the way the stars come out at night?  They just start appearing from everywhere, you see one, then another, and another, and suddenly the sky is blanketed in a sea of twinkling points of light...
-Noticed the way a thunderstorm looks when its really far away, especially very powerful ones.  It's so beautiful, but you have to be happy to be far away, because within it is so terrifying...
-Wondered why we you are here.  What is your purpose, and if I don't have one than why am I wasting the resources for someone who is truly important...
-Wanted to help people and change lives, but not wanted to be a doctor...
-Just looked at somone, while they were staring off into space, and wanted to melt...
-Just wanted someone who you could hug and know that everything is alright...
-Felt the way it feels to just stand with your eyes closed, and let the world swirl around you...
-Opened you eyes in the morning and really only wanted to see one thing...
-Fallen asleep to the sound of sprinklers...
-Fallen asleep and not had a single regret about your day, or a doubt about tomorrow...
-Felt like if your life ended today, you would die happy, and with few regrets...
-Wanted to tell someone you love them, but can't find the words to...

I have done all of these things in the last few days, and I finally find myself in a place where I am truly happy, and comfortable...  With myself, my life and everythig...

Thanks for listening, I like this whole journal thing, I can be more expressive I think and tell you all everything I really want to but half the time can't find the strength within myself to.

'And when you find your self in a place just right, you shall be in the valley of love and delight'

"event","It's just like she said, ""the LiveJournal will consume your life.""  It does, but I managed to stay away until after I finished my homework at least.  We'll see how long that lasts...  So, just sitting here writing, waiting for someone to update, or more people to be on AIM, but oh well, waiting is just makes it that much better when somthing really happens.  Believe me, the longer the better too, six months...  I want to say so much, but I don't really know how right now, so I'll think more and I'll be back later..."

"event","Today was so amazing, nothing to do really, a big waste of a day sponsored by the school, great...  She says I dont scare her, but how can that be, when I scare myself...  I was only away for about three and a half hours, but it seemed like an eternity, just the touch makes my spine tingle.  We went to the park and they did their thing (just make up your minds already) and we let them be.  It was just us and we talked and I've never felt so close and connected to someone, I wished I could have stayed there forever.  But, they say that all good things must end someday...  Thats what we talked about after I got home.  Why does it have to be that way, why are we fed such amazing things that are just destined for failure anyway.  I don't want to be so negative, but its the truth.  Just don't think about it, thats the only way around it, maybe if you aren't trying to find away around the end it will just happen.  Its like vibe, the more you look for it and try to get it, the further and further away it gets, you just have to let it happen and hope for the best.  These last few days have been so crazy, so much has happened and suddenly I find myself in a completely different place then I have been for two years, and its scary, but she takes my hand and leads me through.  She wrote once that she doesn't see why gender matters if what really matters is all on the inside.  Good question...  (yay for ambiguous pronouns by the way)  I can only take this one day at a time and hope for the best, and i have no reason to believe that anything else should ever happen than what is best.  Even if that does mean the end, what must be must be, and I'l have to deal with that.  The whole idea of a god is really intriguing at the moment, it really takes away any and all responsibility that you have over what happens.  Its nice to believe that you can somehow be in control of your own destiny, but isn't it just easier to say that its god's will...  I donno, it seems to me like god is the coward's way out, thing are how they are because god said it should be so, rather than taking responsibility, things are how they are because i fucked up, big time somewhere along the line.  Just some food for thought.  Well, I think I've pretty well racked my brain for tonight, I'm off of bed.

It's OK I AM the Ubermensch

"event","So, I finally gave in and got one of these silly things, don't expect much...

The likelyhood of this getting updated regularly is, well, lets say if the doctor gave you the chances, you would just committ suicide then and there.  Also, if you know me, the things i write here are likely to be out of character, I plan on writing the innermost workings of my mind, which few people ever glance.  Thats not to say that I won't still be myself here, but it'll be different at times, so ya, enjoy..."

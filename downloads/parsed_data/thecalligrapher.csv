"event","<br />If you have not seen it, find it and watch &quot;The Room.&quot;<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368226/</a><br /><br /><p>I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, `The Room' three times. With each viewing, `The Room' becomes more complexly entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where The Room ends and I begin.<br /><br />It is, without question, the worst film ever made. Including movies made on beta max video cameras in special education high school classes. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging. Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark. Simply put, `The Room' will change your life.<br /><br />It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no, there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment in The Room.<br /><br />The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself. Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.<br /><br />The Room begins with `Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly evil fianc&eacute;e `Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny, who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends, says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, `I like to watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very special movie.<br /><br />After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.<br /><br />Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store mannequin, was also the line producer on `The Room' and one of Tommy Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely devoted fianc&eacute;, Johnny.<br /><br />Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again. But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of the fact that she, according to her mother, &quot;cannot survive on her own in the cutthroat 'computer business'&quot;. But not before they recycle the sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.<br /><br />A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to catch a football thrown by Mark.<br /><br />All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the line `You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time. And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The Room,<br /><br />`It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'<br /><br />The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.<br /><br />See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching the gospel according to Johnny.<br /><br />My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream as well.</p>"

Going through my closet, I found two&nbsp;dust-covered instruments that I want to sell.&nbsp; I thought I'd give&nbsp;my friends&nbsp;a shot at them before&nbsp;random strangers.&nbsp;

I have a beautiful antique silver Conn Baritone/Euphonium (it's really a euphonium, but the difference between the two is negligable) and a professional-grade Trombone with an F attachment.&nbsp; It's a Bach Stradivarius 42B Open Wrap.

Both are high-quality instruments, and I'm selling them for very reasonable prices.

If you or anyone else you know is interested, please send me an email at: thecalligrapher at gmail dot com and I'll happily provide more in-depth information.

Friday, April 4- 8:00.
Saturday, April 5- 4:00.
Sunday, April 6- 2:30.

The box office number is 530.642.0404.

Call and reserve your seats.&nbsp; We are hoping to sell out.

If you're coming, let me know (otherwise I'll sneak out of the back door, and I won't say hi to you).

Tickets are $16 for adults, $9 for 18 and under, $13 for seniors (though I don't think that anyone who reads this would qualify for that).

The theater is at 100 Placerville Dr, Placerville, CA.

It's totally worth it the trip!&nbsp; I love my show, and so has everyone else who has seen it.&nbsp; We want to sell the shows out, but we're not there yet.&nbsp; Particularly on Friday night.&nbsp; As of yesterday, we'd only sold about 40 seats (we seat 185- and can add up to 15 more seats).&nbsp; I'd love it if we had to add seats.

I'm trying not to get all wrapped up in the fact that it's the end of our run.&nbsp; I'm going to miss this show so terribly.&nbsp; We had our cast party, and the DVDs got passed out (they are pretty much as bad as I thought they would be- and I might devote an entry to that subject.&nbsp; It is very interesting to watch the recording before the end of the run).

Anyhow- I've got to quit writing about the end of the show before I get all depressed and weepy.

Eight days.

Oh my God!&nbsp; We've been working on this for so long...&nbsp; I'm seriously stressed out about it- but it's the good kind of stress- the kind that makes you up your game and take everything to the next level and make your performance as good as you can make it.

AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ok- off to rehearsal.&nbsp; I'm going to kick ass, and take no prisoners.

Will write more soon.

By the way, I want to know who is coming to see me, and when.&nbsp; I know that Snoopy is coming up with a crew of people on March 1.&nbsp; Anyone else coming?&nbsp; (You really should- I wouldn't tell you to come see me in a bad show.&nbsp; Remember Cinderella and High School Musical?&nbsp; I don't recall telling people that they really should come to those shows.&nbsp; You REALLY SHOULD come see this one.)&nbsp; And when you buy your tickets, tell them that Jo sent you."

"event","&nbsp;Work today was decent- we got swamped at the end of the day, though.&nbsp; It kind of sucked then, but the rest of the day was pretty good. 

Last night's rehearsal was amazing.&nbsp; We worked through ""Could You"" the duet between Jo and Aunt March, and it's significantly improved now.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to doing it again.&nbsp; We also did both of my big solos- ""Astonishing"" and ""The Fire Within Me""- and worked out all the little details that are going to make them all that much more awesome. 

It's funny- sometimes, it's just these small tiny things that feel so perfect in the moment and are the most fun things you get to do!&nbsp; Just the slightest movement can feel so perfect!&nbsp; It's hard to describe, but when you get it right, there's nothing in the world like it. 

Tonight, I have a makeup work shop thinger with someone who is supposed to know what she is doing.&nbsp; There's going to be about half of the cast there, and I'm hoping that it'll be fun.&nbsp; Well, I'm sure that it will be. 

Tomorrow morning, I have an errand to run, then dashing off to rehearsal! 

We're getting our microphones for real tomorrow.&nbsp; The sound guy's going to be there at noon to set us all up.&nbsp; I'm totally nervous, but it'll be fine.&nbsp; It's just different. 

We're also doing a photo shoot tomorrow.&nbsp; It should be cool!&nbsp; It's for a local newspaper.&nbsp; I hope that I don't wind up looking like a total moron.&nbsp; We'll see. 

Got to get ready for makeup thing!&nbsp; And prep for tomorrow's rehearsal from Hell- sound, costumes, lights, and orchestra.

"event","Oh my God.

I've been a serious theater-goer for over ten years.&nbsp; We're talking real professional theater.&nbsp; I imagine that the number of professional productions I've seen is startling.

Music Circus' Les Miserables is quite possibly The Best Show I've Ever Seen.

And I'm not exaggerating.

I'll be perfectly honest: I was nervous when I found out they were going to try to put that in the round.&nbsp; I though it was going to suffer terribly.&nbsp; I saw the show before when the National Tour came through Sacramento, and it was done on a traditional stage.&nbsp; After loving that so dearly, I didn't think that seeing it in the round was going to be as good.

I was so wrong.&nbsp; SO wrong.

First: AMAZING CAST.&nbsp; Downright amazing.&nbsp; Ivan Rutherford (Jean Valjean) is my hero.&nbsp; So is Brad Little (Javert).&nbsp; And Andrea Rivette (Fantine).

Second: AMAZING STAGING.&nbsp; The direction was some of the best I have ever seen.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; It was remarkable.&nbsp; It all worked.&nbsp; Nothing was awkward, nothing looked fake, nothing seemed like it had been specifically directed (I hate the over-directed look of so many shows I've seen).

Third: AMAZING SETS.&nbsp; The Barricade worried me.&nbsp; I had no idea how they were going to manage it.&nbsp; I'm having a hard time describing it- but it was perfect.&nbsp; Everything was clear, nothing was overdone, nothing was over-simplified.&nbsp; It was just right.

Fourth: It was really cool to see my costumes up there.&nbsp; I didn't realize how much stuff I'd worked on!&nbsp; I think I&nbsp;did something to&nbsp;every outfit in ""Lovely Ladies.""&nbsp; And my bigger projects turned out really well too!&nbsp; Mme. Thernardier's ball gown was hideous (it's supposed to be).

I wish I didn't have such a busy schedule.&nbsp; I would really like to see it again.

And tomorrow, I'm going to the Music Circus Opening Party.&nbsp; It starts after the show and goes on til 2:00.&nbsp; I can't wait to actually meet some of these people.

Anyway, it's late, I'm exhausted.&nbsp; I'm going to bed.&nbsp; Good night all."

The show is about an hour and a half, but I'm not sure what the full run-time with intermission(s) is...<br /><br />If you're going to come, let me know.&nbsp; If you don't let me know, then you are not allowed to hold me accountable for leaving the theater without saying hello and thank you.&nbsp; (I've had this happen before- a guy from one of my classes went to a performance of HMS Pinafore and was very pissed off when I didn't stop to say hello to him.)<br /><br />Seating is first come first serve.&nbsp; I'm all over the stage- far left for the opening, far right for the Ball, far left for the waltz, far right again, center, left, right, center, and just right of center for the end.&nbsp; (I get to be dead center for the curtain call!!!&nbsp; I lead the bow and get to be the awesome one in the middle!!!!&nbsp; *snerk* sorry- I'm kind of excited about that.&nbsp; Of course, after we bow, I have to go way the hell down right, but it's all good.)&nbsp; Basically, anywhere you sit will be good for seeing me.&nbsp; I would avoid sitting in the first few rows at the extreme left and right of the house.&nbsp; We have towers that I'm sure will obscure the view.<br /><br />Hope I'll see some of you there!"

"event","I got a copy of Captial Eyes today!!!!&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't share it with you all just yet.&nbsp; Harpo wants to do a little more editing.

But I've got a few (terrible quality) screen shots for you- but I've got to be going to rehearsal (NOW) so I can't post them just yet.&nbsp; I'll get them up here as soon as I get home."

"event","Well- my part of ""Captial Eyes"" is finished.&nbsp; Yes- Captial Eyes.&nbsp; It's our new title.&nbsp; None of us thinks it's great, but it'll do in a pinch.&nbsp; We'll probably change it if we ever get around to extending the film.&nbsp; But it does follow the pattern of having titles have little to do with what's actually in the film.

I got to see more of what Harpo's put together- and once the sound work and music is all in, I think it'll be really cool.&nbsp; Some of the shots are absolutely stunning!&nbsp; There's one of Brian smoking- the camera follows his hand as he strikes a match and lights a cigarette then pans out to show him.&nbsp; It's awesome.&nbsp; Then, there's the insane dolley shot of Brian writing furiously which also turned out beautifully.

Harpo is very proud of a shot of me as&nbsp;I leave the office, but I'm not as thrilled with it as he is.&nbsp; It's kind of funny- I look at Brian, then down, then turn away and walk out the door.&nbsp; The turn away part is what makes me laugh.&nbsp; I'm wearing all black (I'm in mourining, my husband has just been shot) and I've got dark hair, and I'm standing in front of a door of some sort of dark-ish wood.&nbsp; The part where I'm looking at Brian looks great, but I turn away and pretty much disappear!&nbsp; It's really funny.&nbsp; Since it's in black and white, with all the dark colors in the shot- it all runs together and I vanish!&nbsp; So- hopefully, Harpo will do something to make me not vanish like that.

Anyhow- voice overs!&nbsp; It's really tough, especially when you have to match up with the film.&nbsp; Harpo would play what I was supposed to say, then I'd have to match it as well as I could.&nbsp; Then, Harpo would do a little editing to make sure that it was as close as we could make it.&nbsp; The shots where we didn't have to match exactly (if my face wasn't shown) were a lot easier (of course).

I hope that everything comes together just so- it'll be really cool if it does.

And it's going to be finished today- I think by noon.&nbsp; I'll post it somewhere when I can.&nbsp; I'm excited!"

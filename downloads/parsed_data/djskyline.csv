"event","I had an amazing Valentine's day (weekend). Randy took me to an amazing bed and breakfast in Santa Cruz.Friday night we went to Dinner at the crows nest. We had a yummy dinner and good convo. Then the next day we went to the butterfly migration festival at natural bridges and we actually saw butterflies!!! They were fluttering around. It was neat. Ran into Alma and Elaine there, it was random, but since it was such an amazingly nice day out I can see why lots of people were out and about. After we saw butterflies we went and played on the beach for a while. We built a pseudo-sand castle and splashed around in the freezing water. The sun was out and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. It was a perfect day.
We went to eat lunch, then we walked in downtown santa cruz. We bought books, socks and cookies. yummy. 
We went back to our room for a nap and some steven segal. Randy was so stoked that there was a Steven Segal marathon on Spike. It was funny. They tried to claim it was a romantic thing... 
We napped adn then went to dinner on the warf. Then we went to the boardwalk and I beat him at every game known to man because I am that good. 
When we got back, we were thrilled that the segal marathon was still on. (doy.) 
The next morning we ate another delicious breakfast and checked out. We went to the beach again and some fancy pants with a super neat kite was showing off. Randy put out a fire that was left on the beach using his eagle scout skills and I tried to kick some sand on it and ended up kicking my toe on a rock. ouch!
Eventually we headed back to my house and enjoyed the rest of the afternoon.. Went to best buy and La Vic. Mmm. La Vic. 
On Monday, I drove up to his house and he took me to a fancy dinner. It was faaabulous. I always feel soooo friggin' spoiled by my randypants. Oh, How I love him so. :) My heart is happy."

"event","I've had this week off of work. It has been a blessing. Seriously. Teaching sucks the life out of me. I love it, but it is exhausting. It is nice to have this little break before the shit hits the fan with testing. 
On Monday I went to visit my sister in Modesto. It was nice. I like spending time with ther and the kids. I wish they lived closer. I played with sofia a bunch. We did puzzles, played with dolls and watched Spiderman 2 and Dora the Explorer. Daniel was sick so he didn't feel like doing much. Then on Monday night my sister and I went and saw the movie, The Orphanage. It was spooky. I liked it. 
On Monday night I got an email from the band asking to practice on Tuesday night. So, after leaving MOdesto I headed straight for practice. I didn't really get a lot of Tony time Monday, yesterday or Today. 
Today I went to raft with robin and virginia and gabe. I only spent a dollar cuz I am broke as a joke. I am proud of myself for not spending. Then, we went to dinner and to Robin;s for some scrapbooking fun. 
Eidelyn was supposed to go but didnt end up coming. 
Overall, my break has been good, but is going by super fast. 
I still want to clean the house and get my oil changed, go grocery shopping and do some laundry. I plan on cleaning tommorow, going to acupuncture and possibly getting my oil changed. 
I really want to get the house clean because I think Tony would appreciate coming home to a clean house. 
I told tony i would drive him to work cuz I want to spend as much time with him as I can for the rest of the time I have off. The only plans we have is El Burro on Saturday night with the band if he wants to go. 
I love my tony . He is awesome. On valentine's day he made me a spceial card and got me a stuffed pigeon that I really, really wanted. It was nice to get that. I am still waiting for his gift to come from ebay. I wish it would hurry up. Well, that's it for now.. oh yah.. I can't WAIT to get paid"

"event","How is it that so much time goes by between my posts? I feel like such a schmuck. It would be nice to document my life and read about what I was doing in the fall of 07' but alas, I am a slacker. I take forever to post. Maybe I should set aside 10 minutes a day to post.. No matter what.. even if my day was uneventful. 
Well, let's see.. hmm.. what are some of the highlights since my last post?
Well, I went to dinner with a bunch of friends for a joint birthday party for me and tony. Robin, nicole, douglas, virgina and gabe, ryan, lori, jason, trish and justin came out to dinner with us. Joce had to work and Olga had her show. Anyways, that was fun. 
Also, last month Oceans of fire went into the recording studio and we recorded our first album. We need to go back and do a few more things, plus the mixing but I anticipate the album to be out in the spring at the rate we are going. Brian is a new member in the band and he is doing a kick-ass job.
WOrk has been a new and exciting experience. I really like my new school. Everyone is nice and the best part is that it is a lot more laid back than my previous school. I feel a lot less stressed at this school. 
(Although i did do my first formal observation and the kids were real shits when the admin came to observe me.!!11) Anyways, whatever.. if they don't like the way I teach they can fire me and I can get a different job. It wouldn't be the end of the world. Really, it wouldnt. 
Well, tony has been at design reactor for a few months now and he seems to be really liking it there and we are hopeful taht tehy will hire him on permanently in january. 
We've been playing a lot of guitar hero lately. 
Hmm.. Last weekend we went to a pumpkin patch/corn maze in hollister with virgina and gabe. That was fun. I got to feed a goat. We were walking around in a cornpatch at dusK. It was cool. For Halloween day I dressed up as a witch at work and I had fun with the kids. They were all dressed in their costumes and we had a halloween parade. Sadly, they didn't earn a class party. O well. It was less work for me. 
Last week we had parent conferences. Mine went over really well. All of the parents were supportive and I feel like I have a good connection with most of them. ONly 2 parents didnt show up. That is a big success for me. 
Well, I am going to stop writing and go back to Flickr and finish uploading pics."

"event","So, everyday I check livejournal to see what my friends have to say, but usually I am reading and posting to the teaching communities.. I really think they help keep me sane. I belong to one group called bad-ass teachers, and another group called elementary ed and first year teachers. We tend to help each other a lot with the questions and rants we have for each other... I realize that I post to those groups wwwwaaay more than I post to my own blog. 
I didn't realize that it has been 2 months since I last posted to my own blog. When I think about it... I say, ""dang... how am I going to remember my summer of 07' if I don't post."" Now that I think about it.. Not a whole lot of brilliance has occoured. However there are a few things I want to remember and I think now is a good time to post... Can I make the promise that I will post ever day? Every week? NO.. but I'll try and make it good when I do post. 
Let's see. WEll, so far this summer I have managed to clean out my old classroom. Store everything and in 2 weeks I will be unloading everything into my new classroom. Interestingly enough, the room that I am teaching art in this summer at the summer camp is room number B6... it turns out that my room number at my new school that I will be teaching at in the fall is ALSO room number B6... weird huh? Kinda like it was meant to be.. Me and good ol' room B6. 
Well, speaking of teaching art.. My experience at camp galileo has been crazy. Every day I get up at 7.. make it to work by 8. Once I walk onto the campus It's full speed, mondo-beyondo craziness. 
I am always dressed up for a theme-day, Have a water gun on me at all times, throw water balloons to everyone. sing journey at the top of my lungs and dance with my crazy newfound friends. It's so much fun! Then, I teach 3 rotations of art in between all of the madness, I still manage to prep, clean-up, and pee. The downside.. we get 15 minute break. Thats it, for the whole day. 
By the time I get home I am exhuasted. It's draining and tiring. However, its a lot better than teaching summer school. 
Camp will be over on the 3rd. I am anticipating my time off... Well, I am planning to start setting up my classroom on the 7th. That is going to be interesting. On one hand I am excited to have a new ""canvas"" to make my own. A few of my fears include 1) the teacher before me leaving a bunch of crap behind. 2) not having sufficient storage space. I am a believer in Karma.. I left my old classroom in tip-top crap free form for the new teacher.. I am hoping the same has been done for me. Ultimately, it should take a me about 3 full days to really get my new room set up. It should work out ok. I would kind of like to talk to my new partner teachers to see what is expected up on the walls schoolwide... I would hate to set something up then have to take it down to put something else up. Sigh.. so much to think about. 
On a great note, I just found out that Tony got the job he wanted at the graphic design firm called design reactor. It's in Campbell. I think it's going to be a fantastic opportunity for him. I called my sister to tell her. We made up. I knew we wouldn't be mad at each other for long. My parents on the other hand.. that is a different story.. I guess they think I only talk to them when I want something... Maybe if they weren't so damn rude.... sigh....."

"event","Sunday, Sunday... ahhhh .. Tony and I woke up singing the Mama's and the Papa's. I loooove sleeping. It is my favorite thing to do.. Yesterday was kinda wonky because I had to get up at 530 to take tony to work, then I came back home, took a nap until 8am and then took my car to the dealership to get a recall thing fixed. (the dmv wouldn't renew my registration until I had proof that it was fixed!!! bastards!!!) Then, I got back home at 9 am took a nap until 11am, that's when I finally got up to start my day. ha ha.. I tried to sleep as much as I could.
Yesterday I went to Jason's to record some stuff for a couple of songs that we pretty much have recorded and sound excellent. When we go to the recording studio in July they will only need to mix those songs down. 
That should hopefully save time and money. After recording I went to pick up my dad cuz he let me borrow his truck while my car was getting fixed. WHen I went to pick him up I also picked up Virginia and Gabe's glass that I had promised I would give them a long time ago. ha ha... 
Finally, It was delivered to them.. we went to dinner at tomato thyme, it was pretty tasty. TOny and I had actually gone there last weekend with the band. Then we all went to a craft store and bought some felt. After going to the Makers faire Virginia and I felt inspired to make some felt crafty things.. so we did. We spent last night making cute things while the boys drank, played scrabble and uno. It is always funny tuning into them and seeing what sort of random-ass stuff they are talking about. ALSO, while we were driving back from MIchael's we saw colin and his sister right next to us in the car.. We honked and yelled and he didnt hear us!!1 SO I called him and he was like, ""i thought I heard someone honking at me.. "" it was funn.y 
On Friday night we celebrated Robin's birthday at her house. It was a quaint gathering with the craft night group minus eidelyn. Jocelyn was so funny. She had bought some candles for a cake, but couldn't find any matches.. So, she told me in secret that she didnt have anything to light the candles with. Being the creative person that I am (not) I told her to turn on the burner of a stove until it got red hot, then light the candle with it. Seemed like a good idea... Luckily, right as the stove was heating up I snuck some matches away that I saw laying by some big candles on Robin's mantle. I snuck them into the kitchen, shut off the stove and lit the candle on RObin's cake. OOh I also went and watered Nicole's plants. They are cute plants. I think they have a lot of potential.. way better than anything I could grow. 
ALas, today is sunday.. I know we need to clean, but I am not sure what else we are going to do. I am so thrilled that it is a 3 day weekend.. It helps make the last few days of teaching a bit more bearable! I can't wait for summer! Ill be teaching art to kids!!! Then I get to start the fall off in a new school!!! Things are looking good. :)"

"event","Today was a good day. Last night was good too. Last week, overall, was ok. 
Toni and I just got home from going wine tasting in Sonoma with some friends. It was a pretty good time. We were celebrating Jason and Laurie's birthdays so we did it in style... they rented a limo and we met at shayenne and Adam's house in SF. In total, there were 1o of us cruising up to wine country. It turned out that our limo driver was a total spazz, asshole who had no navigational or social skillzz.. but it made for good story telling and making fun of.. so yah... After we visited a few wineries we went back to SF and grabbed dinner a super delish mediteranean restaurant.. It was goooooodddd!!!!
Last night Tony and I went to see Justin play as his project, Seabright. It was a good perfomance.. It was a hip spot, with plenty of friendly faces and a good vibe. His music was awesome!
THere are so many things I wish I could say to describe the intense sensation (<--cheesy, i know.. but how else do i say it?)  and passion that I feel for the music he makes. It's like everything I wish I could do but 100 times better. I feel priveleged to be a part of his musical endeavors and value our friendship and our joined passion for awesome music. (private entry______________________________________________________________).
Overall, Friday was good cuz I didnt go to work! Ha ha.. poor megan had to take my whole class. That's not good. 
Oh well, anyways, we played a show on thursday night at the Hotel Utah. It was ok...the stage was small and I was clumsy.. it seemed like the guys in the band were in good spirits. That always helps. We played with the family aresenal and manchester school. I really liked the guys in manchester school in fact (private entry________________________________________________________). So yah, thats all that has been happening as of late. bwah ah ahaha a... Tony's asleep... I am hot... not like sexy hot, but temperature hot.. not to say I couldn't be sexy hot.. well...probably not.. but yah.. dang.. i should turn on the A/C"

Then I picked Tony up from work and we went and grabbed some lunch. Afterwards, we headed over to Virginia and Gabe's house. We ended up playing a game of risk. Gabe won. I was doing well... I maintained a strong hold on South America for a long time, then conquered Africa.. but Gabe's army proved to be too strong. Ahh... nerdery. 
We met CT. A person that we had only heard many stories about. He proves to be everything he was described to be. He is Napoleon Dynamite's doppleganger. 
After playing Risk, Virginia and I went to this place where you pay to make a bunch of dinners and pack them up and take them home. It proved to be worthwhile.. It cost 50.00 and I left with 18 meal servings of 3 different dishes. We ate some of it tonight! YUM. 
As I type this I am waiting for Virginia to finish her scrabble game so we can play. (Dang.. Tony has already been asleep for 2 hours. It's weird cuz I have always been the one to go to bed first. The tables have turned.)
Tommorow I am going to go to RAFT with robin and virginia and then TOny and I are going to go over to V and G's house for a Star Wars Marathon. THat should be fun. 
ooh.. tony and I got some christmas presents in the mail from his friend Susan. What a nice girl.

"event","It's been a while since my last public post.Well, let's see... what has been going on? Well, my cousin, Tito passed away a week or so ago from a failed heart transplant. He was 33 years old. We were somewhat close growing up but not so much as adults. He had been married for 3 years and was trying to have kids. I don't know what would have been better... Him having kids without a dad, or not having any kids to have his legacy live on with. 
Anyways, last week was spent at funerals, churches and etc. Easter sunday was a little sad becuase my aunt cousins (cousin's siblings) came over to my sister's house and we attempted to help host a family easter dinner. I ended up leaving at 4 becuase I wanted to get back to San Jose early becuase Tony had work the next day. 
It turns out that my sister called me later to tell me that my mom had said some insensitive things to my cousin's wife (the widow). My mom is so clueless sometimes. 
Other than that, hiding easter eggs and watching my neice and nephews seach for them was cute. 
This week I am on spring break! I love having vacations from work. On Monday, I went and filled out paperwork for the new school district I will be working for next school year, then I went over to Robin's house. 
Today, Justin came over for a little while and we talked music and stuff like that. Tony showed him how to do some stuff on some music software programs. It has been fun making music with Justin again. He wants me to help him out with his shows in the future. That will be fun. 
Tommorow, Tony and I are going to go to Gabe and Virginia's for a star wars marathon. Then at night Virginia and I are going to do a cooking class. THat should be pretty fun. 
The rest of the week has splatterings of getting housework done, doing taxes and hanging with friends. It should be a great spring break. I am enjoying it so far. 
My sister called me today and offered tony a free car. One that works and everything. I think that is so rad! ALl tony needs to do now is get a license. he he... that should be happening soon. Hopefully."

"event","Today was a great day! I woke up in anticipation because I was going to be hosting Virginia's bachelorrette party! We had a mighty fine time. It started with everyone (me, olga, robin, eidelyn, erin, sabrina, Virginia and Jocelyn ) Meeting up at my house, after  a little bit of chit-chat and snacking we were on our way to Santa Cruz. We ate lunch at the Saturn Cafe and it was yummy. Our waitress was really nice and not so snooty about a bunch of bacholoretty girls being there. We had these playing cards that had dares written on them and they you were supposed to do the dare. I ended up doing 2. The first one is where  I got a guy  to read out loud ""I am not your typical male and I don't like sex."" The second one.. I yelled at the of my lungs on the corner of Pacific and Broadway.."" I am lonely.Will someone please marry me?"" It was funny because being in Santa Cruz I didn't feel  weird about yelling something like that in the least bit. Robin was good at playing the cards too... She asked someone to eat a bite of food off of their plate, and she threw a  fry at a random person. Eidelyn sang a song that was playing on the jukebox  loudly. As far as the other dares go.. I don't think much more was done.. but there was talk of someone kissing the bald man on the head.. but then he put his hat back on, so that did not work out. While we were at Saturn we also played a few little games like writing a haiku for virginia, asking trivia questions about her and stuff like that. I forgot that I actually had one more planned to play. It was to create an anagram using her and Gabe's name. O well. 
     After we ate we headed over to Natural Bridges. We wanted to see the Monarch butterflies that were migrating.  We ended up spending  a little time in the Natural  Bridges museum and then went off on a little trail. There were no tour guides available, but sadly enough we only saw like 2 butterflies because apparently the windy, cold weather had driven some away. We were unsatisfied with the short,  little traill so we went off onto this side path and went on a fantastic little hike. It was about an hour long. Robin and Jocelyn climbed some trees. it ended up taking us up near  trees, UCSC and ultimately, led us to Natural She sridges beach. It was totally beautiful. The sun was out, it was brisk and chilly. A perfect day for me! Although, some of the girls were a little cold. 
Once we got to the beach we poked around there for a little while. We dared Robin to eat some algae (though she was convinced it was seaweed, Eidleyn the marine biolologist scientist knew better. It was algae.. Anyways, Robin said that she would eat it, but it needed to be washed off first. So I ran it over to the ocean and cleaned off as much of the sand that I could.. then she took a nibble. She seemed very displease with the taste. It was funny. 
Once our outdoorsy adventure ended we went to Neptune's Kingdom to play mini-golf. We split into 2 groups and played  the pirate-ship themed course. I had never played there before so it was pretty cool. 
We left Neptune's Kingdom and went back to my house for a little bit. People snacked a little then went home. 
Afterwards, Jocelyn and I went and ate at Ricardo's on recommendation by Nicole. I've  always driven by Ricardo's and simply assumed it was a drug front. Now having been there it very well could still be a drug front,.but now I know  that they really do serve food there and it wasn't half bad. 
Jocelyn asked if I wanted to go to an art show with her but at this point I am tired. I just want to blast the music (Dolly & Catpower) and relax. Enjoy the fact that I don't have to get up early tommorow and that it is a 3 day weekend! Also, I get to see my doctor on Monday for a physical. I am looking forward to talking to him. He's a nice guy who can give me drugs legally.. who couldn't do with a little of that in their lives?"

The blankets are doing a good job. I know if I go lay down in bed thoughts will race in my head and I won't fall asleep easily. I need to be tired.. and eating a lot of sugar at 11pm at la fondue with a grip of friends doesn't help with falling asleep. Although, it was great fun! 
We had a little outing for Olga's birthday. Those in attendance included myself, olga, jocelyn, virginia, david, gabe, colin, eidelyn and michael.. We had delicious chocolate fonude after eating some burritos by KSCU. I was able to give Eid her x-mas present finally! I still need to give Andrew and Ryan theirs. I shall give it them at band practice on Wednesday. Although I should have given it to them at the bar night, or the movie potluck night.. I just kept forgetting. 
I think I am taking advantage of my vacation and time off work. I needed a break. I didn't really get one over the summer. I just pray that when I go back to work the kids aren't insane.. We have a pretty busy first day back planned for them.. In fact it is going to be video taped by our lame-ass reading coach... ooh la la.. thank god i got the easiest rotation of showing the kids an ""exciting and educational video"" on reptiles. 
I thought I had a lot to write about like my trip to washington.. I guess I can just sum it up by saying it was nice, relaxing, and fun. booyah. that works for me.. O wow.. the heat just turned on? wtf? i think its possessed. o yah.. i did my last radio show today."

"event","Thanksgiving was cool. Pretty low key. It was fun having Virginia and Gabe join us in Modesto. The following day Tony and I took my niece and nephew to this place of amusment called Funworks. We played mini-golf and video games. We ended up winning 362 tickets. That in turn became one giant temporary tattoo, a light up ball, 2 peices of laffy taffy and a blow up batman doll. We fed them nachos and pizza then dropped them off and went home. It was fun. It was kind of interesting because Tony ran off to play games and I was there with the kids chasing after them, losing them. Making sure they were staying out of trouble. It was kinda exhausting. It kind of made me think about what would happen if I had kids. Would Tony be at the pinball machine the entire time? I'd like to think not. I don't think so. I think I just need to not think about having kids right now. That is ok. cuz I wouldn't be able to handle it. 
Well, work has been ok. I am always tired and I want to be there as little as possible. So.. what did I do? Well, the principal is looking to hire teachers in the after school program to work to teach literacy and test prep. So, i decided it would be a good way to make some extra money becuase even if Tony does end up getting a job at some point I will be able to use the money to help pay off credit cards and other stuff. SO yah, Its only 3 days a week. I don't think it wills start until after christmas vacay. 
I am tired. Tony went out to get some dessert.. what will the tasty treat be? Who knows!
Hmm.. I hope our pen pals write back to us soon."

"event","Thanksgiving is tommorow. Tony and I just battled it out at the grocery store for some apples for our pies! Whew.. we got seperated in mob. It was scary. We ended up on opposite ends of the store. 
Before that I had gotten a flat tire. Luckily, we broke down right near some tow truck-car detailing stores so we got to borrow a jack. Then Tony fixed the flat and we went to the tire place by my house. The thing that annoys me is taht the car dealership told me that I needed to get new tires at my last inspection. I told my dad, he checked out my tires and said, ""no way.. you have enough tread to last another 10, 000 miles.""
Can you believe it? SO of course, I listened to my dad. He was wrong. Thank god I wasn't on my way to work on 17 or something crazy like that. sheesh. 
So, i got all of my tires replaced. 
Another thing that sucks is that we were on our way home from the car wash and I had just gotten all 4 of my tires dressed! Damn it.. all the new tires werent all shiny. At least my rims are. 
Well, my car is all fixed and looking like new. At least I can say that. 
Tommorow should be fun! We are having Thanksgiving at my sister's in Modesto. Virginia and Gabe our joining us. It should be cool. 
Mmmm. I am hungry. I am cooking some veggie corn dogs right now. The last time I ate was at 130 with Olga at pizza chicago.. werd."

Tony and I just got back from Bham. We went to Lindsey and Kevin's wedding. It was a nice wedding. Tony was the man (maid) of honor. It was good to go back and see Tony's friends and family. 
Even though all of our time was occupied with wedding stuff and seeing people it always seems really nice to be in WA. I feel less stressed and more relaxed. I wonder if its cuz things are a little slower over there or if it is because I am a thousand miles away from stress. I bet it is a little of both.
Well, I get to go back to work tommorow. I am glad it's a minimum day. I need to ease back into it. I wish I could have a day off to recover from my cold and just rest and clean up and stuff. Work sucks the life out of me. 
Anywho, I just found out that the band is playing a show in December with Halcyon High. I reallllly like that band. It should be rad. 
Argh, well I will try to post more later. I need to get the pizza out of the oven! 
OOh there is this art show thingy I want to go to on Thursday, but I don't know if Ill be able to go if we have band practices. O wellzies!"

"event","hmmm.  I just got back from stitch n' bitch.. It was cool. Anyways, 
Have you ever resorted back to a certain mentality or mental state from a former time of your life? I am doing that right now. I don't know if it is because I am bored with myself or what.. It is very interesting processing everything and trying to rationalize what I am doing internally. It's kind of surreal, yet sort of an awakening to realize how much I have matured in some ways and how in some ways I haven't. 
It was interesting listening to Robin talk about all of the amazingly nice things that Douglas does and listening to Eid talk about how Michael isn't spending any money to save up for a ring.. I didn't have much to add to the conversation. lol. 
Anyways, it is going to be a busy week. Tommmorow i have to go to this social studies text book adoption thingy. Then on Wednesday it is band practice, thursday is back to school night and friday is the field trip to the fair, peter's retirement party and a visit to the caravan. Saturday is TMR. Jocelyn wants friends to go to gilman but I don't feel comfortable there at all. I feel like I am WAY TOOOO OLD to be there. So, hopefully I can help celebrate her birthday on Friday at the Caravan. 
Last night I had a dream that I went touring Europe alone. It was an interesting deam. I am going to start saving a little so that I can travel this summer. I promised myself I wouldn't work. woo! we'll see how that goes. 
I am watching rachel ray drool over brussle waffles. lol. she makes me want to eat  one. he he. sheesh! I should go to bed."

"event","Geeze.. I hadn't even posted to give my birthday wrap-up. Work has been on my mind lately mainly because it is incredibly stressful to work at a program improvement school. I am not sure if the principal has a clear idea as to what she is doing. She is new. It is a mess. I was actually looking on edjoin today.. there are jobs in san jose unified.. why am i not going?!!!!??? I was told that we were going to get shuffled around like chips at the end of the year to different schools in the district. In all honesty, I would like to be transfered to the North Zone. It would be closer to my house.. (drive would be 3o minutes instead of 45) each way.. I would still be working in a district that I am tenured in. That is the main reason why I didn't leave PVUSD this year. I just got tenure and want to enjoy it for a little while. Anyways, I am proud of myself. I didn't bring any work home with me tonight. We went to dinner with Jody and Jay. That was nice. 
Man, I am tired.. I swear.. the time from when I get home from work till when I go to bed flies by so fast. Plus, there are things like band practice and KSCU which suck up a bit of time.. Not that I am complaining. I like those things. It just makes my alone time fly by super fast. Speaking of which! What alone time do I have? I am always around people. weather it is 500 kids.. faculty, DJ's, friends and boyfriend.. the only time I have alone is when I sleep and drive in my car to and from work. I really value a bit of solitude without interruption. 
Anyways, Last week tony and I celebrated our brithdays. We went out with friends to karaoke and had a fun time. Also, the tuesday night before me, gabe, virginia and tony went to see snakes on a plane and we got ice cream. They got me a hilarious gift. It was fun. 
Anyways, Vanes went to Prauge. I am waiting to get some fancy snail mail post card from her or something cool. he hehe. 
Ugh.. I have nothing more to say other than I am STOKED that it is a 3 day weekend! We have a TMR show on Friday, and Tool and Isis on SUnday! woot! woot!

"event","Ok.. so I've had a few meetings with the principal and I think it is safe to say that I think she is going to be alright. Today we spent the day looking over data and listening to her talk about how we need to improve our test scores... It was a data driven conversation loaded with charts and graphs. The entire staff has come to one conclusion. Our president and the secretary of Education are insane. NCLB (No CHild Left Behind) is garbage.
Enough political talk.. My new classroom in the portable is coming along nicely. Things are starting to really come together in there. I have tommorow to finish setting up. Tony the wonder boyfriend spent a few days helping me out. He organized my classroom library and moved books. Hooray for Tony!
The students start on Wednesday. Tommorow is a teacher work day. I will be spending my day finishing up and doing the few things that are actually fun such as making a welcome sign and stuff like that. I get excited when I open a brand new box of markers! he he he.. 
o Speaking of which.. staples has 24 packs of crayolas for 15 cents a piece. There was a limit of 5 per customer, but the manager was nice enough to let me make 5 seperate transactions. I bought 25 boxes. Each transaction was 81 cents. The sad part was that I had to use my credit card for each one.. Bwah ha ha .. 5 transactions in 5 minutes all for 81 cents.. I wonder if the bank will think it is an error? he he he... I am tired.. but I am off to lakeshore to buy some more star borders for my walls."

"event","Argh.. I can't sleep. Why can't I just lay my head down on my pillow and drift off like I normally do? Perhaps it is becuase the past few nights I have stayed up until 4? Well, I wanted to try and go to bed early tongiht because I have to drive to work and meet the new principal tommorow. I guess I can contribute some of my sleeplessness to nervousness. I am actually pretty nervous about meeting the principal. Is she going to be someone that is going to try and break up the amazing atmosphere that we have established at the school? Is she going to be a hard ass cuz we are a program improvement school? Is she going to be pushy, bitchy? I guess my feelings are that anyone who took the job as principal at my school has to be someone who the superintendent said would ""whip us into shape"".. My feelings on this are super mixed. On one hand I understand the stress that the district is under to make sure we are a high performing school and everything that is associated with it.. On the other hand. I don't feel any of the teachers are treated as working professionals or given the resources they are needed to function at the level they want us to be at. I try damn hard to do my best, but people need to understand that work can not consume them. I try to keep busy with other stuff like the band and KSCU, but work always, always, always seems to way heavy on my mind. I HATE the feeling.. of knowing that there is so much to get done, but not even knowing where to begin. It is a stressful thing. 
I hope the meeting goes well tommorow. I already know that she is going to tell me that I NEED to switch classrooms. She told meg (my partner teacher) that rooms were going to be readjusted.. Currently, my room is smack in the middle of third and 4th grade classrooms. Since one of the second grade teachers just left I am sure I am going to get moved to the other wing. It is ok, the classroom has the same layout and I will actually be closer to the office. But, when will there be time to move all of my stuff? I know the janitors will move most of it.. but I doubt the principal realizes that I have trainings all next week and the week after.. Then.. school begins the week after that.. How lame.. O well... just another thing to think about. 
Next, realizing that I have an anniversary coming up and feeling like it doesn't mean much. I know it is sad, but there are certain things that I have come to expect from this relationship. Romance, dates, etc.. isn't one of them. It kind of makes me sad. 
Next, financial woes. Damn, isn't it the end of the month yet? I have bills that are going to be mailed in late becuase there isn't any money in the bank to cover them. How sad. 
Then there is the whole boyfriend without a job situation. It's becoming a sore topic. I am tired of talking about it. I am also tired of not seeing anything happen. I don't know what to do about it at all.I feel like banging my head against the wall e-v-e-r-y second of the day.  
Next, speeding ticket. I got a lame ass speeding ticket on my way home from picking up my mom and dad on from the airport. They said they would pay it cuz my mom was the one making me rush. (long, annoying story)
things to do tommorow:
1)meet new principal
2)lunch with olga
3)work on geotran curriculum
4)work on classroom stuff
5)play live on-air at kscU
6)kiss boyfriend."

"event","Dang.. I can't believe that it has been 20 days since my last entry? Where does the time go? Well, I have been teaching summer school for most of those 20 days and I can honestly say that I am soooo glad that It is over! The class was large, students were unmotivated.. (not really their fault.. i mean.. sheese.. they basically have not had any vaction yet.. and have been stuck in a full day summer school for 5 weeks.) Now.. they only get about 2 and a half weeks off. O well... I wish I had that much time off before I had to go back to start another school year, but I don't. I get 1 week. Then it's back to trainings all the way up to the point of where I start up the 2006-2007 school year on August 16th. I am noticing that a lot of schools are starting alot earlier than I rmember. I know that my school is on a migrant schedule and we start early to accomodate the growing seasons and to have a longer winter break for families to go back to mexico during christmas. But, I've noticed that other school that traditionally started after labor day.. are now starting the last week of august? Wow. 
Anyway, enough about work! I have 9 days off and I am going to enjoy them!
This weekend has been pretty fun! Friday night I helped robin host a murder mystery party at my parent's house. It went pretty well and everyone who played a character did a great job and were super funny. I still feel that I was given the part that had to do the most crazy acting, but I also think that I am a dork and got really into it. 
Yesterday, Tony and I were supposed to go to santa cruz for ali and ryan's wedding reception. We didn;t make it. It was too hot. We couldn't do it. We ended up going out to lunch and to see a matinee of the lady in the water. Then we went swimming at my mom and dad's. I felt bad cuz we flaked out on Robin about going to go see jeremy play his show.. but we ended up seeing some of tony's friends that he hadn't seen in 5 years adn returned some butterfly knives to them. We had a few drinks then came home. 
I have been obseesed with my neopet online.. SO,, i stayed up till 430 playing games to win points for my neopet. lol. I am SUCH A NERd. 
So far today has been very hot. After we finish working on Geotran stuff we are going to go to my mom and dad's and go swimming, bake an apple pie and hang out with virgina and gabe there. It will be air condifitoned, cool and nice. 
The best part of all of this is that I DONT HAVE TO GO TO WORK ALLL WEEEEEK!!!!!! 
The plans are being set for making my week off an enjoyable and prodctuive one.. So far.. Tommorow will be me recording keyboard parts and vocals at Jason's and cleaning... Tueday... kscu meeting & band practice... Wednesday.. hanging out with nicole...I want to go out to lunch with olga and eidelyn. ok! well.. thats the update.. it wont be 20 days till my next post. Promise.

Last Sunday we played at the Make Out Room. It is a pretty great venue.. Nice bar and big enough stage. I hate small stages.. ANdrew always ends up crashing into me with his bass. There was a decent number of people watching us play which made me happy. At one point I counted 3o people watching us play. Next, Last Monday we went out to Kareoke.... my friends had some stellar performances that were amazing. On Tuesday I watched world cup soccer and it was a terrible game for Ghana. Hmm.. on Wednesday..i CAN'T Remember what I did on Wednsesday. On Thursday I went to lunch with some friends then Virginia came over and I helped her bake brownies. Friday night I went to the Nuthouse for Eidelyn's birthday and it was cool to see nicole out with us. We are dinner there and the burrito was tasty. 
Saturday we went to my niece's birthday party in Modesto. We were going to go to Eidelyn's party but ended up being to exhausted from my Niece's party. Tony got to meet some of my extended family and we played with water balloons. It was a cute party. Today is Sunday and Tony and I were having a lazy day... then I started talking to Virginia and we decided to go see Superman. It was a good movie. Afterwards, we went and dropped off the rent for the practice space and had a drink with andrew and ryan at the cinebar. It was nice. Now we are watching a twilight zone marathon. It's starting to get late. 
I have a few more days off before I go back to work. I really, really, really, hope tony gets a job very soon. In fact, I hate to say it but I am going have to insist on it. He needs one cuz we are going to run into some major finacial difficuties very soon. I don't think he understands the severety of the situation. Mainly becuase I am trying my hardest not to be a drag. But I guess there are only so many times I can say ""so... have you checked into that temp agency thing..."" Hmm.. I am looking forward to next weekend... I am going to a spa in calistoga.. It is a bit expensive, but I had already said I would go about a month ago.. rooms are booked and treatements are appointed. I feel guilty spending the money, but in another way its not fair for me not to get to enjoy my semi-summer vacation. The main bummer is that I'm going to miss Justin's going away party.. but we are going to have a private get together before I go. I can't believe he leaves next week. :("

However, just the thought of going was giving me major anxiety. I knew there were people there that I really don't particularly care to see. Also, It was sooo hot. I think my first mistake was checking to see what the weather was like way down there. hmmm. 
Also, there is the thought of seeing my family in large doses this weekend. I kind of feel like I made a mistake by not going cuz 1) I snapped at my dad when he was ""encouraging"" us to attend. 2) My mom is going to say ""the only time you want to see us is when you want to do laundry"" when I see them tommorow for Father's Day and take a boatload of laundry over there to do. 
It sounds silly, but it almost makes me want to lie. Like.. I already told them that the reason I wasn't going was becuase I wasn't feeling well.. but they know me and they know that it is a load of crap. I dunno. WHatever.. I made my choice and I shouldn't feel bad for not going. 
Anyways, I just woke up from a nice, long nap. It was induced by the heat. It was so hot. I just want to scoop up tony and run away somewhere cool. 
My brain kinda hurts.. 
Oh.. I went and saw Nacho Libre with Virgina, Gabe and Tony today. It was funny! Afterwards, We went out to lunch and I saw Colin's parents there. It was funny. His mom is super sweet. 
Last night me, Tony and Justin went to Michi Sushi.. It was a great restaurant in walking distance.. Geeze.. they gave us free alchol there! It was awesome. We ran into Karl and said, ""hello"" to him. It's always fun to run into a familiar face. 
Hmmm.. last week I spent some of my days at a math training for work. It was kind of boring. Next week I have to drive to Salinas for HM training.. WHat a fucking nightmare! This is summmer! I wANT time to sleep in everyday!!!!
Well last week Tony's friend Dane came to visit. It was cool having him here. We went to kareoke on monday night. That was fun...

Then on Saturday, Tony's friends Lindsey and Kevin came to visit and we had a grand old time all day long. Tony drank on and off for 12 hours so of course he felt like crap today. That is probably the main reason why he is already in bed. I just baked a lemon cake and it is tasty. hmmmm. what else should i devulge from this weekend?

This summer I am doing a ton of different trainings and teaching 1/2 of summer school. I am sharing a contract with another teacher so that way I actually get a little break in between trainings and such. I swear, I don't think teachers really get summers off until tehy have been teaching for a really long time... Well, I hope to be teaching for a long time. I am thrilled to know that I am going to be a tenured teacher next year. That makes me happy. My tenure ceremony is on Tuesday, but I am not going to go becuase I need to get up to the city so that we can play our show. 
Yes, the OOF's are playing the Mission Creek Music Festival at the Argus up in SF on Tuesday night. I decided that I am going to take Wednesday off of work 1) I dont want to have to go to work on a day when I am super tired from playing a show in the city. 2) It's a good excuse to go to Virginia's graduation. 
Tommorow night I am going to go and give robin another bass lesson. Hmm. It seems like its going to be a busy week as usual....
Overall, the weekend was pretty great. Friday night -Tony and I went and had a few drinks with ryan and andrew. Then, on Saturday we went to the beach and flew a kite! It was fun! Sunday.. I was supposed to hang out with vanesa, but her mother was holding her hostage. So, tony and i went swimming and did laundry at my mom and dads. ooh la la .. 
Now.. i just finished eating chicken tacos. they were good. MMM. 
Geeze. I need to start thinking about my music.. my solo music. I can feel that I am going to have a creative explosion soon. It ususally happens when I know I have something to write about.  things on the list 1) what do you do when you know a person you love and care about is lying to your face.  2) what happens when you are an open book. 3) what its like to not have someone completely trust you. 
Ahh.. so much to think about.. so much to do. Allz i know is that right now im full, warm and lazy! boo work tommorow!"

"event","Greetings!
    We are back in Cali! The drive back was kind of pooey.. I mean.. anytime you have to be in a U-Haul for an extended period of time can wear you down. Plus we both got a weird flu bug which zapped us. The last thing we wanted to do when we got back was unpack but we managed to unload the truck and get settled in. I stlll have to unpack some stuff. Since Tony has been home during the days he has been able to unpack his stuff and get the kitchen organize which is nice. We got everything hooked up and connected as far as cable, electricity and all that jazz. 
I have been pretty busy since I have gotten back.  We pretty much rested up and recovered from our illness and travel over the weekend. On Monday I went to crafts night with the girls. I gave Robin a bass lesson. I think she is going to be great at it! I taught a basic scale to practice on until I give her another lesson next week. Tuesday night I went to the KSCU softball game. I hung out with Nicole and Jocelyn in the bleachers. Going to those games are fun even though it is always cold as heck! Nicole shared her dried apricots with me and they were yummy! Tonight Tony and I went out to dinner. I was so tired from working I took a long nap when I got home. I feel bad cuz I know tony was ttrying to get me up. Anyway, I have band practice tommorow night. Its the last practice before we play our show on Friday. Apparently, one of the bands we are playing with is cool and the other band is a goth metal band. <--wtf! O well.. I guess its at a pretty cool place so I am looking forward to playing and going. 
Well, other than that.. work has been busy and tiring and insane.. we are in the middle of standardized testing.. I want to gouge my eyeballs out every time i have to proctor the test. It will all be over at the end of NEXT week! Can we say.. CINco de Mayo celebration???"

I can't wait until we get there and we are all settled. I am soo over packing/moving blah blah.. But, I know it is all worth it. The past few days up here have been nice. The weather is good and everything has been laid back as usual. We went and got ice cream yesterday afternoon in downtown lynden. They had venus fly traps at the store that were for sale. I thought they were super cute. he he he..
Well, there isn't a whole lot to say right now other than 1) easter was nice 2) The past few days have been restful 3) I wish my spring break was longer. I will have to go back to work on monday. 
I am looking forward to getting back and seeing my friends. I feel like since I have been so busy moving and packing I haven't been able to see them. Although, I have been very conciencious about sending emails and calling! he he
Well,. im gonna go eat a  snack or something...Next post will be post-move! w000!"

On a different note.. The bulk of my items are now at my new house. Woot! I am leaving sunday morning to go to Pcik up Tony.. We should be back in town by friday. If not.. I will die. Helluva way to spend my spring break.. I'm so tired of moving stuff. Let it all be over soon...
Anyone want to keep me company tommorow night? 
Today was the last day and the kids are now on spring break! I have a training to go to tommorow and saturday. I wish I could just sleep those days. sleep, sleep , sleep.......but alas no... i must work, work, work...
I ate like 2 cupcakes and a cookie. I feel like puking.

"event","My hands are dry. I think I will put some lotion on them. Aren't you glad I told you this? Anyway.. tonight my dad and one of his workers helped me move furniture into my new house. I am very thankful. I feel like my dad does a lot for me. He can be annoying but it pales in comparison to how he has never, ever, ever lets me down. Ever. No matter what I need he has always been able to support and provide. It's an amazing thing to be able to say that about a person. He is a very giving person. It was strange watching him move the furniture. I can tell he isn't as strong as he used to be. It makes me a little sad. He has always been invincible to me.. it makes me feel weird when I see a moment of physical weakness in him. He goes on pretending that he is a strong, young buck. I guess you are the age you act in one way.  
On a positive note my parents celebrated their 34th wedding anniversary last weekend in Costa Rica. I think there is a lot to be said for a couple that can still manage to stay together after so long. I know that my parents still care for each other even though my mom is nuts and my dad can be obnoxious at times. Together they can be explosive.. but I think they feed off each other. It's something they need. Its love. lol. Another interesting observation that I made a few years ago about my dad is that I have never, ever heard him call my mom by her name other than he is introducing her to people, or talking about her. He always has a pet name for her.. Usually honey, or dear, or sweetie. I think its really super cute. It makes me smile thinking about it. 
Other things that make me smile.. 1) Knowing that I have the most spectacular boyfriend in the multiverse 2) Knowing that heavy furniture is already moved into the house 3) Knowing that in two weekes we will be all-moved-in. I can't wait for that. 
Right now my room at tyler's house is in shambles. It is a total mess.. boxes, papers, stuff....I am having the salvation army pick up a bunch of stuff on the 14th. I'm hoping to have all my stuff moved in so that all we have to do is unload tony's stuff. 
Anyway on the band tip.. We are playing another show at an art gallery on april 28th and apparently, we are going to be on a music public access show in santa cruz on october 13th. Crazy huh? Damn thats a long time away. lol. I am realizing that the mission creek music fest we are playing isnt that far off.. its in the middle of may. Im really glad things are moving along for us. I feel blessed to have the opportunity to be so productive in music as of late. 
Work has also been good. The kids are growing up and they are starting to look like third graders! I remember getting them in at the begininng of the year and thinking to myself.. damn... they are sooo little. second grade has proved to be a fantastic grade to teach. I am crossing my fingers that I get the same placement next year. I will die if I have to change curriculums again. Just die. 
Well, I am typing this from my bed. I am getting sleepy doing it. I am stoked that the weekend is coming up! woot! Tommorow night,,, touch my rash! Saturday coffee with justin, ice cream with virginia and working my assssssssssssssssssssss of in between with packing/cleaning. Like I said before,.packing is asssss.... but it will all be worth it!"

We have our little cottage to move into and packing has proved to be a real bitch. 1)  I am lazy. 2) I am busy with other crap 3) I am trying to be organized and methodical about it and I think its wasting more time than helping. he he he..
AnywAys.. last night was fun! I played my show at Johnny v's. A lot of friends showed up and it was great to see so many people watching us,. he he he.. My body is so tired today. All I want to do is take a hot shower and crawl into bed. Do to lack of sleep last night, I think an early bedtime is required this evening. 
I feel today was as productive as it could have been. After taking tony to the airport (one last time!) Tyler and I worked out the KSCU schedule and then I cleaned out my closet of old, unwanted clothing and i got all of my cd's and dvd's organized and packed away.. All the while sorting out things to give away to charity and my kids... so yah, it was ok today. Argh. I don't want to face work tommorw. I think I have collaboration in the morning.. Which doenst mean crap to any of you non-teachers. To me.. it means having to make subplans.. Shit.. i wish i could rembebr when collaboration was. 
anywoo.. tommorow after work : stopping off at the salvation army, stopping by new house to drop off some stuff, going to band practice."

I beg and pleaded for another teacher to take my regular thursday afternoon yard duty location so I didnt have to be out near the grass, but peter didn't want to shift locations cuz no one ever wants to be in charge of watching the kids on the play structure.. I get stuck with it every time. That's ok though cuz next year! I am allll about doing yard duty on the upper black top.. ever since they banned kicking the balls on the black top I dont have to fear balls knocking me on my ass! 
Wow! I really digressed from my main point.. uh.. I've been sicky poo and had a major allergy attack today which sucked, but once I got home I took a nice, hefty dose of claritin and felt relief... SO goood.. 
I had band practice tonight.. We reconfigured the set list... We are doing good songs, but instead of playing the last song where I play violin, we decided to replace it with a new song where I am on keys.. WHat does this all mean? Anyone who is at the JOhnny V's show on Saturday will only get to see my awesomeness play the Synths.. my bass song and violin songs aren't on the set list. O well.. I'm not much of a show off anyway. 
At practice I told andrew that his bends shouldn't sound so porno-music like.. they got a kick out of that. 
Well, the shows on the first and I am super stoked! Lots of friends will be at this one.. It will be great! 
Hmm.. O yah! I told tyler that tony and I got our little cottage! That means I have till the end of april to move all my shizznit out of the place I am at. 
In all honesty, I am super duper going to miss living with Tyler and Alan. They are really awesome and fun and it will be hard to go.. But I know that getting the new place with TOny is going to be the best! I love him so much ! I payed the deposit and when tony comes down on saturday we will sign the least and I will pay the resty rest. Its going to be faaaantasitc! woooot! 
Hmmm... as far as the weekend goes.. tomoorow night possible nuthouse visit (although i havent heard from anyone) definitley having a drink or two at ali's before I come home.. Saturday is Jasons (bandmate) brithday party. tony and i are going to go to that.  Sunday is my radio show and possible double date.. we will seeeeeeeeeeeee..... argh. my brain is tired.. i should go to sleep!"

Eidelyn's party was a lot of fun. I had a good time, engaged in good conversation and ate yummy food. Michael's punch was faaaabulous. MMM.. OJ, sprite and parrot bay... the best drink EVERRRRRRRR. hMMM. The only pooey thing was that me and nic got stuck in traffic for 2 hours and didnt get home from 5 am.. but it was ok.. i mean, it could have been worse. 
Did my radio show today.. weird stuff went on there that isnt worth talking about.. hmm. just got back from dinner with jen tezucar and old friend from high school. SHe is a spazz and a half. lol. 

Tommorow.. more work, I feel like I haven't even thought about work this weekend which is very, very, very rare for me.. I kinda like it, but I dont like the thoughts that have replaced them inseted. bwah ha ha.. I can't wait until Saturday! Tonizzle will be back in town and things will be as they should.

"event","I have yet to post How the Oceans of Fire show was that I played on Saturday night was, so I am going to do that first. Overall, it was an interesting and fun night. First, Jason, me and Ryan went and got some food at a terrible Mexican restauraunt called Antonios that was brand new and we all disliked it. We joked around about getting diareah from the food. We went to the practice space and loaded up all of our crap. It turns out that Andrew had made a few typos on the CD inserts so after spending 20 minutes at work cutting them up we didnt even use them! . O well! ANyways, the show was at this venue called the house of shields. It was a really cool place where we played upstairs and it projected the images down to the bar so everyone could see. It was weird being on camera. We played our set without fucking up too much which was nice. I was a little worried about how I would do. It was weird cuz I guess Andrew had made this collage video thingy and played it and we all kind of thought it was a little on the cheesey side.. but yah.. it was intended to be artistic so no one said anytthing cuz we didnt want to hurt his feelings. Then, Halcyon High played and it was totally amazing. I am glad we are playing with him again on our APRIL 1ST show at Johnny V's. It was really awesome having Virginia, Olga and Colin come out to watch me play. That was so cool.
As of late, I have been feeling pretty industrius when it comes to music. Unfortunately I haven't been feeling as industrius in other areas of my life, I need to focus on the up and coming big move that Tony is going to be making in about a month.There is a lot that needs to get done.

"event","Greetings! I just got home from a night out and about in santa cruz.. It was pretty fun. I went bowling with some friends/ co-workers and had a few drinky poo's. When we went out to leave it was MAJORLY hailing, snowing, thundering and lightning. I HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, in my life been in a storm that insane.. Not even a snow storm in lake tahoe.. The streets were flooded, the freeway was shut down and I thanked my lucky stars that one of my best friends lived 3 blocks away from where I was.. 1) Because there was no way in hell I was going to be able to get home. 2) Becuase she warmed me up from my 3 block walk with towels and tea.. We ended up watching some really bad tv before we went to bed. 1st. we watched this show about tranny hookers and it floooooored me at how gross men can really be.. I'm sorry. I know girls are gross too.. But I rarely, rarely, rarely ever hear/see women picking up male hookers. So basically this show profiled some tranny hookers from Hawaii and went out with them and secretly recorded the stuff that they were doing so the guys wouldnt know. YOu could hear the guys picking up on the hookers, asking for what services they wanted, paying and hearing them in all of there glory cum, cum, cum.... It was crazy. Apparently, a hand job is 40 bucks. other stuff goes way up in prices. The grossest part was when one hooker said she was paid to watch another hooker crap in some dudes mouth. I can't even deal with that... Then to finish it off the main hooker they were profiling told about how she was once attacked at knife point and almost raped but she fought back and beat him up. so yah... OOOH the next gem we watched was a movie. It was about a boy band who turned into zombies.. SOunds brilliant? Well, it was quite possibly the worst film ever, ever, ever, ever made. oh man.. so bad it hurt.. But our curiosty had us watch it all the way through.. Then vanesa gave me some tea around 2 am that knocked me flat on my back and i passed out right before my boyfriend called me. We talked for a little while then I finally fell asleep.. Anyway, today.. I need to do a few report cards and I am going to be playing my show Tonight at the house fo shields in the city. I can't wait to see how that goes! 
Our friend Cameron is staying at our house until next friday. Woot woot! hMMM.. I think someone just started the laundry! I need to wash my clothes! 
stupid myspace is busy....lol. im lame. ooh.. just remmber i need to ge tthe tickets to the hsh show.. asap!"

Not totally hell.. just a little hellish due to the weather. I don't know what happens to the kids, but when it rains they go bonkers.. What's worse is that we are stuck with them during rainy day during recess and our lunch gets cut short by 15 cuz there is no outside play time! I am asking the rain gods not to rain on my parade on Wednesdays, MOndays, THursdays or Fridays. Tuesdays is ok becuase it is a minimum day and the kids go home 2 hours earlier than normal. 
Hmm. I wish it was still the weekend. Sunday I chilled and did my radio show, saturday i spent the entire day with vanesa. We went shopping and out to dinner. It was fun. I spent too much money of course. he he.... Friday I went out for a few drinks. Pretty low-key weekend. That's why I wish it still was the weekend. Anyway, I cant wait till thursday.

The day before we went to the Marina dunes.. Unfortunately, tony was sick.. but we did get in-room massages which were life-altering and amazing. The room we were in had an ocean view and was so beautiful. It was very nice.. Hmmm.. lets seeee.. the rest of the week was spent working, cuddling, band practicing, party at my house and viewing the movie Hawk. There is so much to say, but I guess I will mainly focus on the weekend becuase I don't have the time to write about what I have done the whole week. 
Well, tyler threw a ""finish off the booze"" party at our house on saturday. It was pretty fun. Good friends showed up and Rion was running around with a scary-ass mask on with lighted up faux ice cubes in his glass and wearing shawn's coca-cola sweater. It was very interesting. Geeze.. i cant even remember what tony and i did on friday night... last night we got cheesecake and watched this horribly hilarious and terrible movie called Hawk.. It was rediclous. the witch in the movie used sillystring as a weapon.. yah....hmm. i did my show on sunday and it was nice to get back to that. Today... i took tony to the airport and then went to band practice and i have spent the evening networking on myspace trying to find people to play shows with and all that jazz.... Anyone know of good bands that would like to play with the oceans of fire???? sigh.. i already miss tonizzle. I will see him on the first of march that is only  9 days from now. i can handle it. im gonna go up to waSHINGton and take a few days off work. ooh la la .. what are all you people up toooooooo???"

WHile we were there two giant geese flew across the lake and headed straight for our heads... then one of them tried to steal my slurpeee. They are furocius and mean! I got scared so we left the park. We went home and watched a Korean movie called ""sassy girl"". It is a fantastic movie. Many thanks to Jocelyn for letting us borrow it. After that we went and met up with TOny's brother.. (the only family member I hadn't met yet) in Palo Alto. His brother lives in Ohio, but was in town on business.. so it was a good chance for tony to see his brother and for me to meet him. We got a a beer at this one restaurant next to the hotel he was staying at. Then after that me and tony went to the claran to meet up with some friends for drinks. We didn't stay till 2 cuz that is when total chaos ensues with Jay and Luke and Jodi and Jimmi. Apparently, Jay puked alll over Jimmy's car... (hmmm.. sounds like me last weekend in NIcole's car). I saw Kate and Darin at the Claren I talked to Darin for a little while. He was wasted . he he.. 
Anyway, so after a few drinks TOny and I came home and made peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches and called it a night.. Right now we are being sloths and thinking about what we want to do. 
I think eating something is high on the priority list... so yah.. I will let you all know about our visit to the love bungalo at the marina dunes on monday night. he he.. until then.. let me   just thank nicole for subbing my show tommorow. --kisses--"

Worse, the shipment came via Jingle Truck (see photo) and not military transport.

"event","Picked a scab off a wound today, lol. 

Some slugs who work for another company lost the battery backup/line conditioner for our satellite system-$1600-about three months ago. We chased them around the maypole a few times, then it went dormant. So, being the perennial shit-stirring troublemaker I went back and requested the original tracking document so I could scan it. Of course, since we'd already gone three rounds before, they knew there could only be one reason I wanted it; to open a formal investigation. So, I was denied. ""My system is down"". Five minutes later I request a different document, which he promptly provides. I say now that your system is up, how about that tracker? He rambles a little hoping I'll go away, but I came to pick a fight and wasn't going away without either the document or a fight. 
Now, I know that there was a document because I had already spoken with the party who signed for the stuff and failed to inventory it. He wasn't present, so The Slug tells me that the shipment came without a document. More rambling. He's good and mad, because I have him cornered in front of everyone in the office. Then I switch gears back to the second document which he had printed, requesting he take possession of some tool boxes I had signed from them some time ago. He says he needs an inventory, I tell him it's all on the paper and there are no shortages. He says he needs to inventory them, so I say 'here's the documents, go have at it'. Then he tells me to have 'A Representative' inventory the tools. LOL. I tell him that if my word isn't good enough, then neither is my representative's and he'll have to do it himself. This is where he starts to get really steamed, and I suggest that he'll have to get his ass out of the chair sooner or later. 
He jumps up knocking everything off his desk, rubbing his nose on mine making the sort of noises people make to save face, and I ask him if he's going to hit me. He doesn't take the bait, but says 'If I hit you I'll kill you'. Close but no cigar, drat. By then his boss jumps between us and makes him sit down, and tells me he'll get me the document. 

Tomorrow I'm going to lay out the tools in perfect military fashion, and have all my crew stand there and observe him inventory the tools. 

It's a rare treat to feed someone their own lazy incompetence for lunch."

"event","So I was limping around at work for a couple weeks, trying to make it to my vacation date before having my knee investigated-it went lame after running. (shame on me, I knew better) The Navy Corpsman diagnosed a torn meniscus. So, stateside doc says the same, x-rays, MRI, all that jazz. No problem, an outpatient arthroscopic trim and it should be fine right? So afterwards while I'm in recovery he tells my POA that there were some findings that very much surprised him, but she couldn't be specific to me. I went back today for the 7 day follow-up. He tells me that most doctors would straight up tell me I need a knee replacement. I have cat 2 or 3 arthritis on every surface but one, and the articular cartilage is entirely missing from the medial femur. He was shocked that this was not the issue that brought me in, and hadn't been causing debilitating pain. 
I've long wondered if I'm physiologically devoid of nerves in my skeleton; I've broken quite a number and the bone itself never seems to cause pain, only the surrounding tissues. I suppose I could donate marrow and find out for sure...
So now I have a two-week rest period to 'allow the angry joint to reduce'. As a final touch, he gave a Cortisone shot-I wasn't too keen, but he said it was therapeutic not merely to reduce pain-so I accepted. Let me tell you, I've had some severe pain from time to time in my life, but only two other events came even close to that! I screamed 'Jesus Christ' right out loud, so loud that the entire waiting room looked at me when I came out, with obvious concern/dread/curiosity. WOW. 
Now I have to plan this knee thing into my work exit, because of the insurance. Bugger. Doc said we'll try 'resurfacing' the medial femur, as long as everything else stays as it is. Jeez. Of course, there's the possibility that I'll just drive on without serious pain, and put it off for a few more years. 
Oh yeah, one of the side effects of Cortisone is insomnia, and another heartburn. Dangit."

"event","This has become a surreal life, out here in the Afghan desert with the Marines.
The Marine Corps itself is a culture as different from the average American as imaginable; very little of the mall-crawling civilian is visible here. Beyond that, communication with the outside world is controlled in the extreme, in contrast with my previous posts with the U.S. Army. USMC is the spearhead of the military, and Operational Security is taken much more seriously here than in the less ""Kinetic"" areas which the Army holds. 
I have the good fortune to have discovered what few know, that the Afghan Wireless cellular network has nationwide GPRS; poor fortune to be housed within the range of a great number of electronic countermeasures, which come and go most of the day, cutting the signal off for a moment or an hour. The military MWR (morale, welfare, and recreation) center is nothing more than 20 telephones and 20 computers (at least it's in an air-conditioned tent) with a 1/2 hour time limit and poor bandwidth. 
After a year and a half away from home, I'm wearing out. Worst of all, we're Army contractors 'on loan' to the USMC, and the Marine Corps being the smallest of the services is accustomed to scooping resources whenever possible; they want complete command and control of us, even to the point of telling the Army that they can't access us without going through USMC. Then on top of that, we have to interface with the USMC through other contractors, which is altogether outside the scope of our legal contracts and obligations. Of course, Corporate legal and stateside personnel are looking into it but the hard fact is that nobody wants to derail the gravy train so they all whine like steam whistles but won't take a stand. 
I have about 18 days until my R&R and when I come back, only 3-1/2 months to the end of contract.

I'm sure that I've said how badly this place sucks sometime in the past, and it hasn't changed any. I'm certain it never will.
The schedule rarely allows more than 3 hours of sleep at a time, or risk missing a flight possibility or roll call. Food is on the opposite corner of the compound from the terminal. The tents are full of stinky bastards who will steal your blanket if you make your bed, and take your bed if you don't leave something on it. I had to be very rude to somebody who took my blanket. 

Being rude for me is very dangerous. I&nbsp;don't have much latitude for accommodating ignorance, stupidity, or inconsideration. Once I&nbsp;become rude, it is a very short distance to becoming violent. I&nbsp;haven't been violent in quite a long time now, but every day here brings me (and I'm certain, many others) closer to ceasing to think rationally about my purpose and giving in to blindly beating the crap out of some idiot who stole a blanket I&nbsp;paid $3.00 for. 

I'm hugely offended in part, because these idiots are all making +$50k/year, tax-free up to $91k. Is it too much to ask that people who make more money than I&nbsp;ever have before, usually for doing not very much, not to steal or misappropriate my $3 blanket when they can go buy one in the PX themselves? 

I&nbsp;did have a nice week at home, for what that's worth now. Between the expense of being out of theater and the abuse of being stuck here for more than 48 hours, it's hardly worth it.

The time home was nice if short, had Honeybaked Ham and Turkey for Thanksgiving and flew to Phoenix to visit some friends. Had to drive to Miami for a day, to renew my passport so it didn't expire while out of the country. Didn't sail, didn't ride. Went to look at the car completely disassembled. Nice.

I'm going to open a Scottrade account, and buy some stock. I think there are some magnificent buying opportunities there-Ford and GM for two. Probably some oil companies as well. I think that in 3-5 years it'll make 10-15 times. 
Place your bets, when they're cryin' I'm buyin'."

This has been my home, I've made some good friends here and I'll be very sorry to leave. I really hadn't thought it would be an issue but I've grown to quite like the military workplace, and actually being appreciated for being competent. It was a difficult decision to go to Afghanistan instead of stay here, now it's going to be difficult to pack and leave.
Heh. If you'd told me I'd be sentimental about a dirt patch in Iraq a year ago, I'd have told you that you're crazy.

"event","One of my co-workers confided in me a couple of months ago, something that was illegal and distressing on a number of levels. I chose at the time to advise him of the potential consequences, but did not report him - doing so could possibly have involved soldiers and had career implications. As it turns out, it did anyway without my involvement.
Recently an officer from a different unit stated that my coworker had involved himself in the same activities, and had no prior knowledge. I decided that if it was important enough that he mention it to me, I was obligated to report it up to my leadership. They yanked him out of here, and quite likely will send him home. He has been on the HR radar since before he came into country for one reason or another so my action is only the last straw, really. 
I believe that everyone should be responsible and accountable for their own actions. He violated every agreement he made with the company, and worse he violated every trust and personal confidence he assured. He has earned his just rewards.

So then. I torpedoed the guy. This leaves me with a dilemma- I broke his trust. I promised not to expose him, in order to see what he was up to. I deceived him. Though I didn't turn him in the first time, I intentionally discovered as much as I could about his activities under the cloak of camaraderie, gathering evidence to bank as political capital later. 
Of course, since he couldn't 'clean out his desk by 5:00', I chose to lie to him about my involvement until he got a flight out. My justification was that I was avoiding conflict, avoiding the possibility that he could drag some more soldiers through the mud and take them down with him, and avoiding the possibility that he would smear the company as well.

I believe I served the greater good, at the expense of my integrity. Or does integrity have many levels and shades of gray? Would the best thing have been to take the initial discovery to the Military Police, and have him investigated and removed immediately? Without opportunity to redeem himself? Take his job, and his entire life plan away from him with a single sentence? 

Would that have left me less unsure?"

So. Scheduled 6 days, spent 12. Spent time with the PM and Lead. They are absolutely as badly in the dark as they appeared to be from afar. The PM spent seven and a half hours on a conference call negotiating his way out of the sticky mess of Beancountery between independent contracts, only to have them go the other way the next morning. Anyway, an accord was struck.

I'll be going to Afghanistan.

They need people fast, and the PM doesn't want a repeat of the tragedy that was our Iraq program in the beginning. So he put them off long enough to get the nearest of us to ending our contracts installed over there to begin our new ones. Then probably before we're set up and ready, we'll get a bunch of FNG's with the usual spread of competence and motivation. 
I'm actually looking forward to this-I've come to dislike professional contractors pretty thoroughly, and I'd be lying if I said I won't relish the opportunity to take out some frustrations on any miscreants that come my way. I already have a plan to keep a videotape file for the 'councellings' and 'reprimands'. 

Of course, I'm not doing the Senior spot for the money-certainly the paperwork, accountability, and Goat-Roping isn't worth the extra pay. But I couldn't bear the thought of hearing horror stories about the Afghan program in flames like the Iraq program is. My unit here isn't happy about me leaving early, but they admit they don't need me very much and they'll probably deploy to Afghanistan anyway in the next round and would like to have things run smoother than they have here. 

I've spoken with plenty of people who have been there (Kandahar, BTW) and there seems to be no gray area; either they loved it, or hated it. Google Earth doesn't show much but rocks...not much different than here really except I don't think it's surrounded by walls so at least we'll be able to see the horizon from time to time.

Since the beginning of this 'Training' we've been told everybody has to go through it, and that they would go through in the order they came into theater. Of course that's not how it worked out-they processed the dead wood and left us alone...then when we ask for information updates, we got ""Oh it will all be clear...if you'd just get through the training you'd have everything...""
Naturally it's too much trouble for somebody to burn a CD and send it in the FREE mail to us.

I suspect we'll have a good round of Poker and some laughs, and I can get some eyeball time while asking what they really want out of the new reports we're obligated to provide. They always send out new report forms, usually with instructions and then totally contradict the instructions with the email text.

The weather has been changing, we were certain he'd have another weather delay or cancellation. They flew, he flew, now life can get back to normal dullness. 
The jerk managed to take advantage of some chaos and wedge himself into a position where he has to wrangle 80 people in probably 30 different geographies which are only accessable by air for us. Now that he can't handle the workload, he's managed to talk the tops into attempting to create 4 or 8 positions beneath him, to actually do the field work. Holy crap, I can't imagine that sort of speed-bloating in an organization but then I never worked for General Motors, either. Of course the tops will always add more positions if they can get them into the new contract, because the company profits by presence not production.

I went through training with him. I know him, and his skillset. He took the lead position because he can't cut it in the shop, and it truly is a better match for him. Unfortunately, that leaves the rest of us answering to him to some extent.
Arrogant isn't really the right word, rather condescending to a degree not often seen after leaving your teens. Of course we're all tools here, and I know where his handle is so it's more profitable to use him rather than get drilled. He confides in me because he acknowledges me as his intellectual equal. (I never bothered to tell him I have him by 10 IQ points when he mentioned his, and how it made it hard to deal with 'normal' people)and because I'm truly the only person in the entire country who will sit and talk with him. Good intel. 
He was supposed to fly out Saturday morning, but something scrubbed the flight. So, on for today...then weather hold. Now, I got hit in the ass with a sandstorm and nothing will likely fly for two more days. 
Better yet, he's roomed two trailers away so he doesn't have to go far to find me. Woe.

The weather was really weird all day, very high humidity and a few raindrops this morning. When the sun got up, it was about 115* and 90% humidity-not a great combo. Then getting covered with sand and dust, and of course Murphy has to throw in his $0.02...left my eye protection back at the room so I got lots of practice blind-walking.

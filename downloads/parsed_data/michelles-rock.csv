Yesterday was my 7 month anniversary, I never imagined I would be with Brendan for 7 months.  Now I cant imagine my life without him.  

I love college.  Like, LOVE college.  I just wish Brendan and Steph were more availabe to me here.  

My parents are coming this weekend.  

I miss Steph and Brendan.  

I love my roommate.

We rearranged our room when everyone said it wasnt possible but were just that awesome.  And our room looks so pimp.

I LOVE TOWSON."

So its raining  and Michelle and I are wearing like sandals, while walking across the crosswalk, I slipped, then grabbed on to her and then she slipped and we were both screaming.  I guess you had to be there.  But then we were walking and Christina's umbrella held a branch back and it let go and it flung and hit Michelle in the face.  It was really funny. I just thought I should share my funny story to brighten your day.  :)   MY SISTER COMES HOME IN LESS THAN 10 HOURS!!!!!1.

"event","this morning i was informed that Solomon King died.  In 7th and 8th grade we were really close and I used to go to his house.  it seems like many people lost touch with him once we started high school, but we still smiled at eachother in the halls and talked when we had the chance.  I cant believe hes gone.  16. that is way too young.  Nobody this close to me has died before, with the exception of Ian, but we saw that coming, and i dont know what to do.  This is shocking.  So tonight, turn on your wipers, turn down the music, pay attention, and try to watch out.  God Bless You Solomon.  I will always remember all the fun we had, I could never forget you, even if I tried.  Rest in Peace."

"event","ok so today i didnt go to school because my throat hurts and i decided i needed a mental health day.  Yesderday was freakin awesome, right Sam??  

Being home all day while everyone is at school is boring so i was thinking what shall i do?? when all of a sudden i thought BLACK PEOPLE MUSIC!! That's right everyone i made a mix of 1 hour and 43 minutes of pure dance music, its all black people music, except for eminem, but he counts as black.  Its so good and i cant wait till we all get down and funky at our next get together.  

So besides making the best ghetto mix EVER, i have done nothing all day and i'm going to fail precal, but who said i need precal?  Well i'm going to listen to all my ghetto glory,

Kisses,

"event","Today was really fun.
I got out of bed because I had to throw up. I'm really sick. I mean REALLY sick.

I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

Last night I had to finish my term paper on the history of pre-communist Russian society. I focussed on the needs of women. I think it's ok, but if I don't pass this I'll lose my scholarship.

I want to tell the world that my girlfriend Amy is the bomb! She made pizza last night, and even though I burnt my lips on the cheese, it was awesome!!!

I am updating this journal for the first time in ages, because I've been in prison.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's some photos of my cock.

I want to say thanks to simon and Abbey and Dave and the other Simon for helping me on Saturday. You guys are the best. By the way, if you happen to find my wallet, keys or underwear, could you SMS me? Adrian has my number. 

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have bipolar disorder, and a healthy imagination.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

hit parade tomorrow @ 7 30 be there or die im nervous

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this poem I wrote. It's about my friend Robert, who has bipolar disorder. Just like me. And Heidi.

"event","omggg i feel so bad.  i borrowed caitlins chapter package to copy.. i know it was wrong and ill never do it again, but i said i would give it to her after school, but when i came home i wasnt feeling well and slept and then i woke up when it was dark.  im soooooo sorry you dont even know.  if anyone knows where she goes in the morning or what she has first period i would appreciate it if you told me.  im so scared because now shes not able to study for her test and its all because i was too lazy to do it myself.  this is the first time i copied someone but still thats not an excuse.  i just cant stop thinking about it so everyone remind me to find caitlin.  and if youre reading this, im so sorry and i really dont want to wreck our friendship and i hope you can forgive me.  im done procrastinating and i will never copy or take someones work.  i am so sorry caitlin, i cant even express it in words.  please forgive me."

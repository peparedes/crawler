It's still nice to jump on and see what everyones up to instead of taling to them (which would be hard living in West Virginia now).  I'll be back in O-Town around X-mas though... anyone know of any good shows for the holidays? 

Every morning I wake up there are cows across the road and deer running through the yard... I'm not used to this lol

Everyone keeps asking what the fuck I'M doing out in the middle of nowhere... One word :CHRIS

Other people are popping back into my life and calling me and I don't know if thats good or bad. My car keeps falling apart... i get the belts fixed now its making another weird noise and not driving right... its idleing really low too... I'm not sure if I'm moving away anymore, I'm not sure about a lot of things.  All I know is that this month has been horrible and Ive gotten myself pulled into some bad things... drugs, too many drugs in the first 20 days of the year. Ive been keeping myself fucked up to make time go by faster.  I need help.  I think I need to go see someone. I can't stop crying...im so lost... someone help"

*Halloween was major fun... can't give out details but lets just say i was fuuuucked the hell up & someone stole something off my porch... a little tin dog from the Briar Patch that I named Spork.  I was so pissed

*Got into a car wreck... had to buy a new radiator

*Got 2 cats from Pets Mart... Dookie & Pookie.  They are the coolest in the world

*Bo-gator (my savannah monitor) died like 2 weeks ago. I made Charles burry him with a pinky mouse. Im gonna get a skunk gecko soon.

*haven't done any photoshoots cuz Carahs been outta town... I miss the shoots and chillin with Carah =)

Yea, people see what I go through but they don't <I>Feel</I> it.  I'm just sick of having to deal with shit but anyways.... I won't go into that.

"event","Charles n I are finally in our new home.  It's off 29th street in Sanford.  We live with his best friend Danny whom he works with.  It's cool cuz Charles gets to be around his god daughter all the time.  And Dannys mom lives here and she is the shit.  She makes us dinner every night & car rides with her are funny as fuck!  My puppy LOVES it here.  He has a huge yard to run in now & he's not left in a room by hisself 24/7 cuz he stays in our room.  Yesterday this dude came over and fed him a $20 nugget.  My dog was fuct the hell up.  He ate a bunch of beggin strips and 2 bowls of food and when this dude knocked his smirnoff over he licked it all up.  We cant be doing that all the time but it's funny every once in a while.  Hey, at least he slept on his Scooby pillow all throughout the night without waking us up for once.

I'm happier right now then I have ever been in my life.  Getting to cuddle up every single night with the person you wanna spend the rest of your life with is the best feeling in the world.  His touch is so comforting and all the little things he does for me.  I can't imagine my life without him ever. I've never been this much in love in my whole life. He IS the reason I wake up every morning knowing everythings gonna be ok.  I know you all are probablly thinking ""oh, lets see how long this lasts"", right?  Well, we will see... and I know you guys are gonna be amazed when 10, 20 years down the road the sparks between him and I havent changed one bit.  We are just perfect to a T like that.  O.K I'll stop with the mushy-ness.

---> Whitney!!! I'll call u in the morning tomorrow so we can chill, ok bebe?  & if anyone else wants to hang out anytime before sunday this week leave me a message on here and I'll call or get in touch somehow.  I <3 you all and hope you're spring break is rawkin it to the max.

I got to see muh Josh-ness, Amanda-ness, & Melanie...  Me, Amanda & Marcus played Bomerman for a while.  Great shit! It was really nice to see them again.  I was gonna stay the night but I decided to get home to Charles... Him, Danny & Steph pulled up at like 10:30pm.  Jenn and I just got back from picking Chris up at Red Lobster & he was telling us that all the staff is fucking each other and it's full of drama.  He was saying how he is not gonna get in the drama but some shit appeared... kinda funny. lol.

Charles was at work till midnight so I went to Jaymes & Shyannes new apartment and watched Jay & Silent Bob. BOOOOOOONG! Then I went home and Charles was home so we went to bed.  My dad came over this morning at like 8 and I got in the car.  He told me my mom called him this morning crying.  He brought me to school cuz mom aparently wasnt going to.  I love him to.  I feel closer to him lately for once in years.  It's his birthday and it kinda made me feel bad cuz his eyes were tearing up.  We all feel like the family is falling apart.  Today when I get home I'm gonna start packing some boxes up to move.  Charles and I are getting a 1 bedroom apartment in like 2 weeks.  Calie and Chris are getting a 2 bedroom apartment in the same place too.  so me, Charles, Chris, Cali, Scott, Jaymes, Shyanne & Kalaya will all be in the same apartment complex.  It will rock cuz we can all hang out and stay awake till 4 am every morning! Tonight I'm going out to dinner with the familt for my dads b-day then I'm going back to Calis.  I don't even wanna step foot in my house right now. Jenn Rivera is picking me up from school and we are bringing our pit bull pups to the dog park together.  Bogator misses his brother. 

Anyways... off to 3rd period... Spring Break Thursday after school!!!"

"event","So yeah... i'm really happy cuz I got a new puppy Tuesday.  He's a 6 week old brindle pit bull.  My friend Jenn Rivera got his brother (the runt) and we are gonna have thme play togeher a lot, take them to the dog park n all. He is soooo adorable.  I originally named him Chaos but inside jokes led to his name being Bo-gator *re-shnitzled, you're gonna be my dietary supplement, 2 llamas climbing up a mountain"".  Oh, ignore that. So yea... We took them to Petsmart Wednesday and I let him pick out his own toy... It's this rope thing and I got him a  collar that I know he'll just grow out of in a month or so. His paws are huge cuz he has 25 % rot in him.  He's gonna be around for a long time and I NEED to raise him correctly so he wont bite people.  Most pits are either very sweet or very aggressive.  Mine shows a lil of both so far.  He's already chewing on metal! He is pretty much potty trained already.  He goes to the door when he wants out.  I have him ont h ebest puppy food possible (Pro Plan) and hes a pig. He loves Kalaya (my freinds 4 month old baby). Hes kinda protective over her already. The 2 cats don't really like him. He's so cute when he sleeps next to you.  Last night he was laying exactly like charles.  right leg on the side of the sofa, left leg straight n all.  I'm taking him to get all his shots in the next week which Charles is paying for. I'll get pics of him on here as soon as I get the time. Oh, and I'm moving in 3 weeks.  I need a car, a job, and well... a life, but at least I got my dog, right???

MARCUS: Mom just told me yesterday that you have called a few times. I'll be at my dads this weekend so give me a holla 767-6452."

 The one that makes me scream"" she said 
 ""The one that makes me laugh"" she said 
 And threw her arms around my neck 
 ""Show me how you do it 
 And I promise you I promise that 
 I'll run away with you 
 I'll run away with you"" 
 Spinning on that dizzy edge 
 I kissed her face and kissed her head 
 And dreamed of all the different ways I had 
 To make her glow 
 ""Why are you so far away?"" she said 
 ""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you 
 That I'm in love with you"" 
  
 You 
 Soft and only 
 You 
 Lost and lonely 
 You 
 Strange as angels 
 Dancing in the deepest oceans 
 Twisting in the water 
 You're just like a dream 
  
 Daylight licked me into shape 
 I must have been asleep for days 
 And moving lips to breathe her name 
 I opened up my eyes 
 And found myself alone alone 
 Alone above a raging sea 
 That stole the only girl I loved 
 And drowned her deep inside of me 
  
 You 
 Soft and only 
 You 
 Lost and lonely 
 You 
 Just like heaven"

Charles, Chris, Scott, Cali and all of yous... thanks for putting up with me lately... it's been really great getting to see you all a lot more (like every day). hahah <<<<3333 Good luck in winning that HGTV house. hahah *huggles*

My Birthday is in like 2 weeks! w00p w00p! Chris, you and I are going out either friday the 7th or on the 8th like we talked about... which ever day we dont go out... then you and everyone else can go out with me on the other... get krunked and have fun. YAY!!! I don't know where Ima have my B-day party.  

As of now my dad and I are still not talking.  I don't like it cuz I love him a lot and I hate things how they are.  I wish I could talk to him.  I wish he could understand me.  Last night my stepdad actually sat down and had a real heart to heart conversation with me for the first time in years since ive know him.  He has REAlly good advice.  Noone has ever been able to actually help me cept him before... He totally put me in another perspective and let me see things kinda how my dad is seeing them.  It made a lot of sence.  My dad wants me to sign my title of the car over to him. I don't have to if I don't want to, but I really don't want the emotional ups and downs so when and if he does ask me to sign it over, I'm gonna do it.  Cuz if I don't thats going against my father and I don't want things to be like that cuz I love him.  My stepdad thought of a great way for me to get an even better car within 2 months so thats what I'm going to do.  My Camaro has like 170,000 miles on it! it's just going all to hell... okay im out"

Do you all agree? Yea... quit laying the fuckin guilt trip on me... My mom was yelling at me to get back to my dads last night... is that so rude of me?!?!?! I mean... you don't even bother IMing me or talking to me online anymore so I figure I would break the Ice and say hello....

Me: What up bro?
U: nadda
ME: Did u guys have fun last night
U: ummm, i guess
ME: Whats wrong?
U: nothing
ME: O
ME: *Signed off*

That was me trying to at least talk which you don't seem to want to do... so stop making me look like the fuckin' bad person... Thats fuct up of you and I think everyone agrees with me.  Don't sit here and tell me I don't care blah blah... cuz U don't seem to want to even talk to me anymore... which I guess is cool with me about now cuz u are fucking weird anyways... so in the end... I TOLD U THAT JAMAICAN GUY WAS WRONG!  I'm going on strike... guys who don't understand  anything at all.... no matter how hard you try and they can't see it... are doomed to find woman... they should just all live in their own state... 
....Now just to let you know... This post wouldnt be taking place if you had not of started it to begin with so now I just had to stoop down to your level, how do u like it? ... imaturity.... lack of communication before knowing what's the real deal.... just flat off tell a mother fuckin' person off before you know what's going on... yea, youre SO cool dude... I'll just stop talking to you and Vice Versa... Thats what you want so I'm not holding back... Although we are still gonna be seeing a lot of each other... I can deal with it cuz I'm not childish like that... can you

Anyone else besides Amber cuz shes the one that fuct me over can tell you I am very smart, intelligent, very caring to people I barely even know, Ive never fuct anyone over... so evidentally nothing is wrong with me... I ask people about you and some of them say ""yea, he is pretty immature, and even selfish sometimes"" ummmhmmm, have you heard that about me from anyone? THe only thing youve probably ever heard was ""yea, she should call and work things out with you instead of ignoring them"" , well hun, when u stoop down to this level what else do I have left to say but I hope your life gets better and I wish you the best of luck, really..."

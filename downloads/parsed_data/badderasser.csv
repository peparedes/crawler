Weird.

Tonight was a lot of fun....for the most part.

I have no justification for being so upset about things but I still am. I expect better of you than I do of me, yet you have fucked up so many times that is not reasonable.

My MRI went well. I listened to Michael Buble (how do you spell it?). The guy who did it was real old.

I don't get it. 

ps my current music obsession is voxtrot/the weepies. yes."

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The letter M"">Laura as assigned me M....my words will not be as amusing as hers were though, just a warning...<br /><br />1. Monday- Well, it is monday and i hate mondays. It is rare that something good happens on a monday, except for I turn 18 on a monday i think...that will be good...i also like the song manic monday but the cool punk version :)<br />2. Money- this is another thing i am not overly fond of....seriously, why can't it just grow on trees?<br />3. Math- I am not in a math this year and i enjoy listening to everyone who is complain about it and know that for this year i don't have to worry about it, although i am fairly good at math so i don't know why i'm not in it...<br />4. Mob- Contorno went to be part of the mob of protestors today, i wish pool was cool like him...freaking kids who have contorno!<br />5. May- Well it is now May. We graduate this month. we take ap test. we take our final. college people come home. we have all our graduation stuff. my soulmate turns 18. my auntie comes from seattle twice. It is going to be a busy month!!<br />6. mollusca- we are studying this phylum in aquatic science right now...or maybe we just finished it and are starting on another one...i do not know really but i do know i have to know a lot about this phylum come friday so i can do well on my test. I think it includes crabs but i could be mistaken....<br />7. Mistakes- theres another word. We all make them, but i don't think we should dwell on our mistakes. shit happens. move on with life.<br />8. Monetary- this is one of the policies i learned for the economics test last monday although i cannot remember it to save my life today, only a week later<br />9. memory- clearly i have a bad one. This is not true, it is just very selective and only remembers things that are of absolutely no use to me. Lyrics to a spice girls song from 4th grade? You bet! Random inside jokes? Of course! Economics? Oh hell no!<br />10. malapropism- this was one of our vocab words meaning the extreme misuse of a word. I balled the vocab test and i just like the word so i thought i'd throw it in there!!<br /></div>
<p><br />19 school days left....24 normal days....2 ap tests....i only have 2 finals during finals week (only 1 of them i am counting as being a real final).....oh school is oh so close to being over and i'm not sure how i feel about that fact anymore<br /></p>
<p>Morgan and I were working on her end of the year slideshow today in photography and she is doing one to play at her grad party...we were sitting there going through the pics and I noticed one that had a much younger jamie and was slightly amused for a moment until i noticed mrs rowley was sitting on the couch smiling in the picture....it was after she got sick...i started to cry</p>
<p>i don't know, leaving soon is making me miss things.....</p>"

<P>i got my hopes up that everything wouldn't change again, and it did. I should learn and quit setting myself up for disappointment</P>
<P>i hate it, but i know i will <STRONG><FONT color=#33ffff>never</FONT></STRONG> change so it will continue to happen</P>
<P>i can't decide if i love the new cook or i hate him....i think i like him? </P>

Boooo, I think i'll cry :( At least my 32 hours this week will be good for my wallet cause I could use it what with needing to fix my car and the fact that i still have like 3 presents to buy.</P>
<P>i get in random moods where i get really happy for other people, it's kinda odd. Espically some of the people that i get really happy for. oh well, i'm a <STRONG><FONT color=#33ffff>weird emo gal</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>So, has anybody studied yet? I sure haven't. And i lost my binder with <STRONG><FONT color=#33ffff>all</FONT></STRONG> my assignements in it....poop. </P>
<P>This year has gone by so amazingly fast. For the most part it has been simply amazing. Finally being a senior, having an amazing experience in mexico, first love and all that jazz. There have been a few really low points such as losing my grandfather and first love, but it really made me realize how wonderful my friends are. I love them and will miss them terribly when we all go our seperate ways in 8 months. </P>
<P>Anna and I talked about college today. I really love the idea of driving to San Francisco with her, it sounds like it'd be a lovely trip and not too long after Seattle either. I am so excited about this coming up summer. I'm not sure it could top this past summer....but it's looking like it could sure give it a run for it's money! Of course it'll also have getting ready to leave and stuff....sheesh, we're all growing up so fast. Some days I just want to curl up and watch Little House on the Prarie or make up mean songs about large people (before I realized how wrong it was). I don't know...sometimes life is just funny and it changes so fast but most of us grow and learn and adapt and i sware i'm shutting up now</P>
<P>1 week girls till the ultimate senior bonding!!!</P>

<P>Goodnight loves :)</P>"

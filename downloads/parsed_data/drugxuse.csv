"event","Harsh words & violent blows
Hidden secrets nobody knows
Eyes are open, hands are fisted
Deep inside I'm warped and twisted

So many tricks and so many lies
Too many when's and too many why's
Nobody's special, nobody's gifted
I'm just me, warped and twisted

Sleeping awake and choking on a dream
Listening loudly to a silent scream
Call my mind, the number's unlisted
Lost in someone so warped and twisted

On my knee's, alive but dead
Look at the invisible blood I've bled
I'm not gone, my mind has drifted
Don't expect much, I'm warped and twisted

Burnt out, wasted, empty, and hollow
Today's just yesterday's tomorrow
The sun died out, and the ashes shifted
I'm still here, warped and twisted"

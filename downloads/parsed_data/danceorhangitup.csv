than to leave the country
and live in a cramped apartment in northern ireland
and work at my cousin's bed and breakfast.
just start completely over.
i just want to meet people, hear their story.
i want to be wreckless and <i>enjoy</i> my life.
i dont want to just go through the motions.
college is just something to give me material for my first novel.
i'm here for the experience, the education is a layover. 
a fall back if my writing career doesnt go as planned.

"event","yes.
we are young and wreckless.
but nights like these make me glad that its still acceptable for us to feel indestructible.
untouchable.
driving back to richmond at 3 oclock in the morning.
after games of beer pong.
lame frat parties.
stealing expensive liquor from the person you introduce as the one who ruined your life.
who will never know it was you.
after asking our future senators, doctors, and lawyers if they knew where we could get some weed.
cops. ambulances. sirens. 
hiding.
cracked skulls and smoking roaches in a laundry room.
city kids just glad they were able to see the stars for a night.
no street lamps, only identifying each other by the embers of our cigarettes.
driving down 95 at exactly seventy.
we're close when the city lights start to drown out the stars.
and tonight.
strung out an all different things.
each person on their drug of choice.
driving aimlessly around a city we complain is closing in on us.
suffocating us.
but on nights like these.
no one seems to notice."

"event","what i wrote on my last cc trip:

i feel that, even in their simplest forms, words are more-or- less ostentatious[though rightfully so]. the sheer meaning of the word just illustrates the futile struggle between the word and its meaning. the subject and the objectification of verbs, hyperboles and other such tawdry presumptions. emotions expressed through colors, shapes and [god forbid] sounds seem far too...easy. there are wheels turning but the results are inevitably bound to leave something to be desired. writing is an outlet for those of us not blessed with ""artistic"" ability. the artist's ability to replicate a rose on paper. to paint a mural. to photograph an object and pass it off as something you created. capturing a moment in time and making it your own. its theft. writing takes a level of [most of the time uncomfortable/horrifying] introspection. the beauty of writing is it's intricacy. a photo, a portrait, a song- you can take all of them for face value. but you'll never know the difference between a tragedy and comedy until the last line."

i'd sit across the table from him and tell him exactly why i haven't spoken to him in two weeks.

i drank three cups of coffee as we talked in circles.
i told him i loved our banter.

i copped out. as per usual.

i dont know where it came from but finally i told him.
he's been different since that night.
that night things almost went to far.
almost.
he said it was just a thing.  
he didn't want it to change anything between us.
a thing doesn't happen every day for a month.
i told him, i guess i wanted to give myself some space then.
he said ok.
just 
ok.
forget i said anything. i said. please, just do me a favor and forget about it.

he hugged me like he hadnt seen be for years. he told me that i smelled amazing even though i'd just put out a cigarette. for the first twenty minutes it felt like the first time i went home to see him. i was all shakey and talking too much and i couldn't stop grinning. its strange to feel so at home with someone you've only known for a month. that lives an hour away from you. in your old home. 
its strange to know what you're missing. its even stranger to not mind.
we took the escalator up to the smithsonian and i turned around to find him staring at me. he asked if he could take a picture of me, because i was absolutely beautiful. i cant tell you how long i've waited for someone to call me beautiful. 
we went to get sushi and he ordered a few beers. as he loosened up he asked the question we'd both been afraid to ask. what did i think things would be like if i still lived in northern virginia. our answers had slight variations and i already missed him sitting right across from me. i dont usually let myself do this. its unrealistic. we both know it. but i cant remember the last time someone made me smile like i do when i'm around him. 
he put his hands on my face and kissed me on the corner of constitution and 17th st. somehow he saw the light change and grabbed me by the hand, only to kiss me harder on the other side. 
we fell asleep on the metro on the way home. the only two times i've ever had to say goodbye to him it was rushed. i hadn't prepared myself for how hard it would be to say goodbye when i had nowhere to be. he pushed me against my car 
and lips and teeth replaced words and i was thankful for that. he told me to get into my car and exit music for a film was playing. by the time i came up for air long enough to tell him i had to go subterranean homesick alien was on. it took until exit music came on again to convince him to leave. to convince myself to drive away."

things just kind of worked out.
he knew it was for him.
i've never been that kind of girl.
but he didnt stop smiling the whole first night i saw him.
i'm beginning to understand how i could become that kind of girl.
he stood in the doorframe of my bathroom watching me fix my hair.
he looked at me the way no one has ever looked at me before.
he smiled and i asked him why.
he said i was just so pretty. 
that he wishes he could take a picture of me at that moment.
when my eyeliner was running and my hair was out of control from the rain.
i made him a vegan dinner because he asked me too.
we woke up at exactly the same moment 4 times last night.
each time it would hit me like a pile of bricks that i was in his arms.
he'd pull me closer and ask if i was alright.
alright would have been an understatement.
he had work in two hours but he didnt get mad when i woke him up because he was snoring.
i was his exception.
he asked if i was ok with it. 
i was.
i am.
i'm just trying to take this one step at a time.
waking up next to him this morning was unreal.
fumbling for my shirt as the sunrose. 
i can't even understand how this all happened.
now.

when you can relax outside with a drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other, chain smoking your problems away. and the only thing you worry about is how much vodka is left. everything you say makes sense at the time. you're not sure if its because you're drunk or for once it actually coming together. you want so badly for him to hold you and say baby its gonna be ok. we're perfect for each other. and you love when he calls you baby. but you're not sure who you want to say it to. but it doesnt bother you because you're with people you love drinking and smoking and its summer and you have no worries. and everynight should be like that. you feel more at home than you have in forever and its just right. and its been so long since somethign just felt right.

i knew he wouldnt call. i was ok with that. even as the words left my lips there was no doubt in my mind that he wouldn't call. we talked and im back in this hole where i have to see him again and try to convince him he wants me more than i want him.
i'm sick of playing these games with myself.
for some reason i believe he'll call today. i'm not sure why. 
the light stayed green and yellow when his band came on. i'm a firm believer in karma and its about time things start going right for me. i've been a good person lately, i've relentlessly taken care of my friends. so its my turn now.
right?
i guess we'll see.

im so sick of this not in my chest. 
its like this nagging reminder that im not doing all that i can to make myself happy. 
so starting today....starting today."

now, of all times, i can feel.
i shouldn't feel like this.
not about you anyhow.
its different now. it started as something i controlled. no one has been able to get to me the way you have. 
you cant leave. not now.
no one has ever <i>gotten</i> me the way you do. and now i know that there was a reason i wouldnt let people get me.
my whole life i've moved around. i got used to saying goodbye and not caring.
you forced me to care. and now <i>you're</i> the one leaving.
i cant really imagine my life right now without you. i know we have two seperate worlds but i cant imagine what its going to be like not having you to come to. 
none of this is meant in a creepy obsessive way. its not like that at all.
its just that no one has been able to get through to me for a really long time. and you got through to me. you made me feel like what i have to say matters. you made me feel like what im passionate about is worth while. you made me feel like i was worth something.
thank you for that. thank you for making me feel again. 
i know we'll (distantly) keep in touch. it kills me more than you realize. im hoping, right now, for the 1% chance that we'll keep in close touch. 
i know what you're doing will make you happy. and you're going to be amazing at it, theres no doubt in my mind. i just dont want to lose you.
i've never talked like this about anyone in my life. im swallowing my pride right now as i admit this all to myself. i guess all i can say right now is thank you. 
thank you."

"event","Dear President Bush,
   For the past 3 years or so, you have been using the war on terror as your political crutch. Yet you've found no substantial evidence of another country having weapons of mass destruction. On September 11 you and your adminstration made the assumption that Afghanistan was the country responsible for the terrorist attacks. For the sake of the arguement, i'll believe that you had reason to believe that. After you successfully got the American public to believe that we were waging a way on Afghanistan, you slowly moved the ""terrorist"" lable over to Iraq. Did the American public ever once question whether or not Iraq had anything to do with the attacks? No. Because you, Mr. Bush, are very good at covering your ass. You got American in such an uproar about those attacks that they were willing to call anyone a terrorist. Now, I am in no way, shape, or form trying to take away from the tragedy of September 11th, but you used America's sense of fear to make them believe that invading Iraq had to do with our sense of security. You, Mr. Bush, are the terrorist. You have come to equate the word war with patriotism and i'm sorry sir, but that just is not how things should be.
   As I recall, President Bush, you once promised to generate more jobs for the unemployeed. Statistics show that during your presidency, 3 million men and women have lost their jobs. In December, 1 thousand  jobs were generate. Congratulations, Mr. Bush, you are certainly doing a fantastic job.
   I also have a vague recollection of your pride when you said that our economy is doing fantastic. Well, Mr. Bush, I certainly consider a $500 billion dollar deficit quit an accomplishment. Oh, but you don't have to worry about it, because it will be my children paying it off.
    I also have to hand it to you, sir. You really are doing a fantastic job with supporting the troops you send over to fight <i>your</i> war. Yes sir, it is your war. These men are giving them selves up for your cause, they arent asking questions. How do you repay them? Why, you cut their pay! Oh, and then when they try to go home to visit their families, you lef them cover the cause. You sure are considerate President Bush.
    Now i could go on for hours with these questions i have for you, sir, but I'll conclude with the idea that irks me the most about your speech last night. Marriage is about love. Marriage is about caring so much about someone you cant live without them. Marriage is not about race. Marriage is not about religion. Marriage is not about political affiliation. Marriage is not about sexual orientation. Every year there are millions of men who beat their wives, there are divorces, and there is adultery. We let all of these people get married because its ""normal."" Mr. President, I'm sorry but I have a difficult time believing that you would stop the marriage of two people who truly love each other. That you would prevent two humans from being completely happy together. That you would do this based on an outdated law from Leviticus. I've been in catholic school all of my life, Sir, so I'd like to think i know the Bible pretty well by now. Leviticus also states that  a woman is unclean for seven days while on her period, and seven days following her period, and to become clean, she must sacrafice two birds. I'm sorry sir, but how many women do you know do this? Leviticus also states that you can not trim the hair on the side of your head or the edges of your beard. I cannot help but notice, Mr. Bush, that you have short hair and no beard. Interesting how we can pick and choose what we can believe from Leviticus and what is complete nonsense. Thats what trying to ban gay marriage is. Nonsense.
   God Bless American."

"event","when i was babysitting i had one of those moments where you forget where you are. i wouldn't call it deja vu. it was like when a certain smell or taste reminds you of a really specific moment. or when you wake up and halfway through the morning something will happen to remind you of part of the dream you had the night before. you cant put a finger on what made you think of it, and even the part of the dream you recollect for that moment is fleeting. 
i was playing hide and seek with the kids i was babysitting for. i hid in one of the bedrooms and the windows were opened a little bit. and just the amount of light coming through the windows along with the freezing breeze just made me remember my childhood like i cant even describe. just walking down the street with my brother + danny and playing until it got dark and we had to come in. dark always came too soon when you were little. drinking the rest of my grandmother's bailey's irish cream because she always insisted it tasted like candy. running out the front door and sitting on my front porch trying to catch my breath after seeing my father cry for the first time. understanding what the word cancer meant. sitting in my new brother's room next to his crib and listening to him breath. we'd just taken him off the heart monitor and i couldnt bare it if my mom lost another baby. getting my first fat lip in a game of backyard baseball. running around my cousin's house with ghostbuster packs on our backs. wondering why my body didnt look like the girls in playboy. watching my grandfather play banjo at my aunt's high school graduation party in my backyard and being so proud of him. going to my aunt's plays and being so excited when she came from back stage and gave me the first hug. sitting on the edge of my bathtub with the door closed and letting the vapors try to clear my chest when i had bronchitus. walking to laurie and johns and running barefoot around my neighborhood. cutting through backyards much to the dismay of my topless sunbathing neighbor. venturing through the woods to ""our spot"" and trying to start a protest when they starting building houses there. my aspirations were always far ahead of my time. taking pictures in my front yard before my dance recitals. my dad telling me we couldnt go to the movies that day. watching my brother sob after they told him my grandfather died. i was older and he couldnt see me cry. saying ""its ok michael"" and running to my room, thrusting my greif stricken 9 year old body on the bed and sobbing. where they couldnt see me cry. eating pancakes that morning and ruining the taste of them forever. understanding why i couldnt ever see my grandfather again. swinging on the swings in my cousins back yard when he explained to me that cousins couldnt marry each other. someone had just told him about it, i never knew why he told me. getting infuriated when my neighbors would play on my swing set when i was eating dinner. the immense sense of pride i experienced when my father talked about me in my grandfather's eulogy. balling at the fact that i had barely known him. the last words i said to him. the taste of cheesecake never being the same. 
i just sat there on the edge of the bed for 15 minutes not even realizing where i was."

"event","she coughs to make sure you know she's still there. you cringe and turn on the tv for background noise. you here, her voice screaming for attention but you just cant stop distracting yourself. she whispers, ""this is as close as we're going to get, so lets get this over with"". you turn your head to the side and say, ""what"" as she slams the bathroom door shut. through the cracks in the walls and the creaks in the floorboards and the claw marks surfacing on the other side. you cant help but wonder who will be the first to break. she screams ""i hate you"" and you turn up channel nine just to have the 6:00 news slap you in the face. and as you drown out the sounds that surround you cant help but think ""i need to get out of this place""."

There have been times when I've just wanted to just poof be gone. I know it's not easy dealing with so many situations at once, yet through it all I'm reminded that even though I feel alone and discouraged, I'm really not. God has been faithful, even when I haven't been to Him. He reminds me that despite my foolishness and selfishness, He's really more than sufficient for me. He lets me know that it really isn't all about me, but all about Him.
My faith has really been tested for the past few months. There are things that are beyond my control and I feel as if my world is falling apart. I've had to litterally cry out to God for help because I've felt like I was about to break down and go mad. It hasn't been easy. I've felt loveless, friendless and even abandoned. Nonetheless, with my emotions feeling shot at times, The Lord showed me that I was putting all my hope in the wrong person or things when I should've been placing my faith and hopes in Him alone.
Palm Sunday during service I had a breakthrough. The Holy Spirit was moving in such a marvelous way during prayer time at service. I felt God's hand of deliverance upon my heart and He restored so many things within me I could really feel His love envelope me with such sweet gentleness. I realized that I will make it no matter what and that I will survive all of the situations that surround me only with His help and guidance."

"event","Well, today is Friday and I'm just ready for this weekend. I really need some time to relax. I was in a car accident on Tuesday; thanks to God, I'm okay. The brakes on my car went out and, unfortunately, I rear-ended a parked car. My car is out of commission for the time being, nonetheless, I'm grateful to the Lord for preserving my life and keeping me from hurt, harm and danger.
I'm going to have to get a rental, at least for a week so that I can get around and do what I have to do. I did, however, get a phone call tuesday afternoon for an interview for a job. God knows all things and He knows what's best for me. Anyway, I took the metro to downtown Silver Spring and had a great interview. Looks like I'm going to be working for the Office of the Mayor of DC, which is only a short bus ride from where I live.
I'm just happy that I'm alive and I'll be getting a good full time job and soon I'll be getting my new apartment. I believe things happen for a reason, regardless how upsetting and unfortunate they may seem. I'm trying to keep my faith strong and stay positive about the issues that I'm dealing with..."

"event","<p>This week's been a little crazy. I worked all week and I baby sat one of my nieces on Friday afternoon. Lately I've really been on a worship tip. Not that I don't like to worship, because I do, except lately I've longed for it more and I can't get enough of it. My spirit just longs for being in the presence of God and just putting my heart out there in the open. I've also realized how much I miss worshipping in spanish, it's funny because before I just wanted the english version of worship and praise in the church. I guess it's because it has been a long time since I've done it. I'm thinking about visiting my old church so that I can have a taste of that. I think it's the Latina side of me.<br />I found this site called imeem.com and it has a whole lot of music that I can listen to. I've placed the mp3 player on my MySpace page. I have over 40 songs on my playlist, both in English and Spanish. It's kind of cool because people get to listen to the stuff that I listen to and rate and stuff. Right now I'm about to do a little housekeeping around the house so that my boo and I can hang out later on and not have to worry about cleaning.<br />God&nbsp; has been more than good to me and I have to give Him props for that because if it weren't for Him, I would've lost my mind eons ago. He deserves all the Glory, Praise and Worship.</p>"

"event","<font size=""2"" color=""#3333CC"" face=""comic sans ms"">So yesterday me and steph got in a fight over nothing, and though it may have been thrown outta proportion a little, it was just me telling her how I truely feel. If she can't handle the truth then i guess she can't handle me, maybe this is for the best. So yah she decides that she no longer wants to be my friend after I call her to apologize... which by the way I never would have called to apologize in the first place because she is so in the wrong and over reacting and I can be stubborn as a mule its in my Italian genes! So my brother told me to call her up and told me everything to say to her, cuz i could not think of 1 nice thing to say to her at the moment, trust me! Yah so she doesn't accept my apology and she starts bitching at me, WELL FUCK YOU STEPH nothing you said to me is gonna change how I feel, your acting immature and illogical and you need to realize what you just did and who you just lost. 

By the way my brother was totally making fun of steph with me b4 i called her. I was like Dino I just called her and she said she'll call me back cuz shes dropping her friend off at the sky train station, and hes like yah she'll call us back when its convenient for her... what a nice girl, and we were harsh saying a lot worse shit about her, but i dont wanna break her little heart since this lezbo is crushing on my brother and all. 

So yah the little bitch calls my brother and is like complaining to him about me, and the bastard is agreeing with her, so im like whatever my brother is so two faced, she thinks he's all on her side but really he just wanted to blaze her weed. YOUR GETTING USED BITCH! So she tells Dino to tell me that she wants all her stuff back, so i text msg her with, ""you aint getting shit back"" and she calls Dino again whining about how im not gonna give her stuff back. So my own brother goes into my room gets stephs stuff and drives it over to her and blaze's with her. AND THE FUCKERS WENT TO SEE KILL BILL2 W/O ME! Me and my bro were suppose to go and we invited steph BUT THEN dino decided to side with steph and they went together, THOSE FUCKERS!!!

I think what hurts the most is that my own brother sided with Steph. Yah and after she read this Dino went over to her house and comforted her aparently cuz she wuz in histarics. WELL GOOD! I HOPE THEY BOTH DIE!"

"event","<font size=""2"" color=""#FF6600"" face=""comic sans ms"">This is one of my favorite songs right now and it describes how probably alot of us have felt before about someone in our lives.

Itz by Usher and itz called Burn:

[Intro] 
I don't understand why 
See it's burning me to hold onto this 
I know this is something I gotta do 
But that don't mean I want to 
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just 
I feel like this is coming to an end 
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you 
I gotta let it burn 

[Verse 1] 
It's gonna burn for me to say this 
But it's comin from my heart 
It's been a long time coming 
But we dun been fell apart 
Really wanna work this out 
But I don't think you're gonna change 
I do but you don't 
Think it's best we go our separate ways 
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby 
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with 
I think that you should let it burn 

[Chorus] 
<font size=""3"">When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

<font size=""2"">[Twist]
<font size=""3"">Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

<font size=""2"">[Verse 2] 
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to 
Got somebody here but I want you 
Cause the feelin ain't the same by myself 
Callin' her your name 
Ladies tell me do you understand? 
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? 
It's the way I feel 
I know I made a mistake 
Now it's too late 
I know she ain't comin back 
What I gotta do now 
To get my shorty back 
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh 
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Without my booo 
You've been gone for too long 
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours 
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn) 

[Chorus] 

[Twist]

[Bridge] 
<font size=""3"">I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) 
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah) 

<font size=""2"">[Breakdown] 
<font size=""3"">Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh 
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) 
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh 

So many days, so many hours 
I'm still burnin' till you return 

<font size=""2"">[Chorus] 

[Twist]"

I've never been a religous person. I've been to church a few times with friends but thats about it. Recently I've been reading a book on spirituality which can be categorized under ""New Age Spirituality,"" which has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with spiritualty! :) 

<font size=""3"">This is dedicated to Tasha and well myself...

<font size=""2"">Fear of losing is an inevitable effect of having people, places, and things in your life that you like, love and get attached to. Even while you're enjoying these contacts to the fullest, there is a note of concern that one day you may lose what you are enjoying so much right now. This is because one of the great universal laws of life is that ""this, too, will pass,"" Good times will pass, and bad times will pass. Easy times will pass, and difficult times will pass.

The bad times passing is something you don't mind at all, right? But what about that ""good times will pass"" part of the equation? How can you enjoy, love, and relish all the great people and things in your life without being fearful of losing them?

The secret of enjoying good times without fear is to live in a higher vision that inspires a sense of detachment. With this higher vision, you're focused in the present moment, and not spending today worrying about what may or may not happen tomorrow. With a higher vision, you know that all beings and things are made of one surpreme spirit that can never die and that doesn't really come and go, except in external appearance. With this higher vision, you free your mind from its concerns and are able to experience life through the heart, which beats with contentment and peace just beneath the waves of your mind."

"event","I clearly don't understand why somebody that has access to a fully functioning bathroom doesn't see the need to take a shower. 

The door to the room that my ""err aunt"" sleeps in is open, plus she has the window open - that air is horrendous! (and I'm not talking about the air from outside coming inside.... her BODY ODOR). It's like that smell of a spot in a train station where so many people have just pissed on + sweaty t*at juices - NOT CUTE AT ALL!!! ((for those who would know; think the underground passageway from the uptown to downtown side at 23rd st/8av station for the the a/c/e train - NYC of course)).

Then again, it could be my ""err uncle"" who's passed out on the floor in the living room from drinking, smoking and playing his Xbox 360 all late night/morning long. I mean he hasn't taken a shower in like a week or so. Now if you know you have to be to work at say 7pm, why would you wait until 6:45 to start getting ready and then don't take a shower because that would make you late? (by the way he works about a good 5 minute walk away) 

Now we are beings that produce body heat. HEAT RISES!!!!!!. There is no way possible that a person can not smell their pits or crotches especially since those are 2 of the top places on our bodies that sweat the most and produce a huge amount of heat!

..... now me, the second I get out of bed (when I wake up); I immediately grab my towel and washing stuff to jump my ass up in the shower. I can't stay all salty and whatnot from the previous day (not unless i'm really too sick to move much or if its the weekend and all i've been doing is watching tv nonstop). and even then I usually jump in the shower before the end of the night is up.

AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT SMELL..... there is the lingering smell of grease. This female is forever cooking something (usually something fried). And that smell gets stuck in fabrics. The living room, clothes. I really hate it when I've just done my showering and gotten all dressed and them BOOM here she comes in the kitchen cooking something in oil."

What can I say about this place, this borough, this old stick in the mud that I once called home? A lot of things apparently. One of which is that it isn't as c""cold"" as I previously had thought for the past several years. I guess I kind of got extremely used to life in Queens and how much ""warmer"" felt it seemed to have been. But yeah, having been back here for the past few days makes me miss it even more so than before. I never dreamed that I would. 

The things that you think about at times really can make you reflect on something or past things that made you think in another different tone (I hope I said that correctly. I know all to well how things can sound and play out so much better inside of your head and then BAM!!!, they mess up once its out of there.) .

I must remember to update it as long as possible. Probably because I feel that I don't want to let go of something that gives me just a slight bit of bliss. Yes, I said it. This actually gives me some sort of pleasure (and no, not that other kind of pleasure that most people know I think about a lot).

Anyways, I don't know what brought the thought of this website to my attention. Oh wait!..... I so remember now. I was on the verge of signing onto another site that has a blog section of their very own. Rather then post this there, I quickly thought about this instead. Here I am, so BAM! (Oh and yes, my mind thinks much faster than I realize. Sometimes I often forget that I actually have a very well, working & intelligent mass of bubblegum blubber up there). Also I'm very lazy so I've not utilized my brain as I once did back when I was younger and definitely not in these days now. My brain, of course is a bit upset with me. But he can blame that on my mom and send my dad the bill later on. LOL

And on that note, I've forgotten what I was going to put down here. It had something to do with ""me being about to write my feelings down on paper, srceen, board, ceiling wall so much better than actually verbalizing it to somebody. I guess I get all caught up in emotions and then nothing comes out as it should. As it is said or/and thought up in my mind."

Un-clean people would have to rank as my top/biggest pet peeve if not in a tie with another one or one of the biggest that I have. I just can get past people that don't like to wash up. And I'm not talking about washing up by the sink where you pour some water on a rag and wipe your face and maybe your pits, chest, arms & crotch. What's so freaking wrong with getting your damn ass in the shower itself. Let the damn soup clear off & gather up that dirt and let the hot water rinse it away. Why can't some people do that? Why are so many people that have the opportunity to do that pass it up? What is wrong with these people?

I like to take a shower every day. If not in the morning then sometime during the afternoon or early evening. And if not then, then at night lik right before I go to bed. Sometimes I've missed a day or two because I was either in bed asleep all day or because I was too sick to keep myself standing up while taking a shower. But that's as far as I've been without washing up. Even when I've done the whole washing up by the sink, it was like I was still in the shower because I made it so that my whole entire body go sudsy and soapy. I had to place a towel under my feet so the floor wouldn't get soaked but hey I did it. I washed my ass. 

I just can't go around smelling bad and having to pass by people. The nose knows no lie. When somebody walks pass you, guess what?, they are bringing with them their body odor (which brings their actual body scent, not to mention the scent of the environment they've been in, other people's scents, any food or extra that they've encountered recently) and air which pulls things with it. My nose is always on alert. I can always tell when some random person has passed me by that they need some deodorant on. It's like an alarm clock or a red alert alarm going off in my face. It smacks me back.

So yeah that probably ranks high up there along with people that can't see the obvious. I mean most things are just in front of your damn face. Even if not look for it. Also side noting off of this is people that ask stupid questions on sites/social networks/forums withough actually looking it up for themselves. We're in 2011 for god's sake. If you can get on to one of those sites to ask the dumb question then you have the access to actually look it up online. I can see if you took the time to research it yourself and couldn't find any answers - that's one thing but those that just outright and ask without looking it up themselves just frustrates me so much.

From basically ad literally everybody. I guess the only people that know about it are the few friends on here that I have (that don't use this site that much or at all anymore) and any other random person on here. Other than that, nobody. I think there is too much of a personal sense here. And also I write about things, people and my frustrations & interactions with people & my friends. Sometimes it can be a bit juicy and sometimes I can go hardcore evil on some people. For them to actually read about it hear wouldn't be so good. It's happened before that I was venting to two of my friends about somebody and that somebody found out by reading what I had wrote. I forgot in that one instance to delete the window, and a whole bunch of stuff went down. We're still good friends but our friendship I don't believe is like it was before that happened. And I'm still not sure that he believes that I was just merely venting out my anger as I was doing. So who knows. I think me not letting people know about this is good for me. Who needs to see a therapist when I have this right here?"

I would honestly have to say that I'm somewhere in the middle of that.

Sometimes I love to make people laugh. Being serious all the time isn't any fun for me, nor is it for anybody. It feels good to crack a joke here and there. Usually most of the things that I say that make people laugh aren't jokes at all. Rather they are actual things that mean something. But I guess because of the tone that I use when saying them or/and the situation that they are said in, it seems like a joke. Only some people actually know when I'm joking and when I'm actually just saying things that aren't actually jokes.

On the other hand, because I'm a Virgo; I love to be entertained. If you can't entertain me at some level, then me being around you won't happen that much. I'll find you absolutely boring. And with most people I do not want that to be the case.

It has to be a bit of both. Give & take for me. I give & take and you give & take, when it comes to laughter.

It's all in good fun.

Plus I have a great sense of humor. I do crack people up not to mention that I crack myself up all the time. lol*

NYC.

Enough said.

But other then that it is one (if not THE) best cities in the whole world. We have so much going on here. Wait, a minute we have everything going on here.

Changes? Lots should be made. 

Like MTA; forever always going up on the transit fare. They're always talking and crying about they don't have enough money. REALLY? NOT ENOUGH MONEY? There is a few million people living here that are residents. That plus the commuters that we get from N.J. & Conn. (also from Pa. & Mass.) ((plus the other few that fly in all the time from other states & countries)) + all the freaking tourists in the world that visit all the time. Each one of these people paying out almost $3 for one-way. Some if not most that use transit multiple times in just one day. So that right there is like what: a good $20-30 a day for some individuals. Let me not forget the toll money coming in from the Midtown, Holland, Lincoln Tunnels & The G.W. & Triboro bridges (I think you might have to pay for the Whitestone & the Throgs Neck also)... and most of those are like $5-10 tolls each way (and we all know that this city gets a HUGE amount of cars coming in and out... so seriously where is there a lack of funds at? Now I know that of course the workers have to get paid and maintenance & repairs have to come out of all of that money but come on now. There is still a huge amount left over afterward. I'm pretty sure about that.

Living space. Now this is a big city, but at the same time it's also a small city. One thing that I've noticed (and it may be true or false) is that we always gets kids straight out of High School going to College over here and yes they usually get school housing but some don't. Also people from other states moving in looking for a new start or a better life. That's understandable. But I would love to really smack the people in-charge of housing & renting. It seems like every time we get new people moving here, that the rent increases. My response to that, is people stay in your own damn states for a bit. Us actual native New Yorkers are having a hard time finding places to live here ourselves without you all coming in taking them and thus increasing things. Now that might have sounded a bit harsh, but eh. ... sometimes I can't bite my tongue.

All in all I still love this city. And for the most part, I don't see myself leaving it. Maybe for a little bit in the future, but not too far from it. As I've lived in New Jersey twice before.

Earlier today on HBO (on-demand) I watched Devil.

It wasn't as what I expected it to be. You know with the whole lots of blood, screaming demons and all that. It was like a murder mystery. I wouldn't even put this in the same class as Constantine or Max Payne. That's how ugh it was. But it entertained me the one hour & twenty minutes running time it had.

Maybe if I had not read the ""plot summary"" of the film beforehand then I might have enjoyed it a bit more. But with me, I have to read that before I watch something; especially if what I'm watching is within the confines of my home. It probably didn't take nothing from my speculations other then knowing who the actual killer was, but eh blah!

Again it was like a murder mystery with a bunch of people detained in an area and then suddenly one by one they all start to die. Everybody is looking to pin the blame on the next person. Tensions start to rise, fears are running through the roof, & people find themselves doing something that they thought they would never do before. Others start to believe in something that they always shrugged off as ""old wives tales"".

All in all, it was okay but not all that great.

The Brian Files.

Something simple like that. I mean with all that I go through, that itself would get high ratings and keep people gagging and wanting more let alone coming back to watch more. Especially with the people and relatives that I know. Ha!

Oh boy there are so many things I would say. So many little subtle warnings I'd give to myself. But then again I don't think that would be much of a good idea. I might change my present self far more worse then any good. I probably wouldn't have met some of the people that I now know. And I was quite smart back then so me meeting myself wouldn't be such a surprise. My 10yo self would most likely know that it was me just by looking at me. I'd leave a note for myself explaining things. That would be the best way to tell my younger self about things to come. I would leave it anonymous, although my younger self would figure it out (since I write pretty much in the same tone & manner as I did back then, just now with more different words).

It would definitely be so weird for me. But it would surely a life changing yet adventurous experience for me & for my younger self. Something to always remember & cherish.

We can end it by not backing down & beating the sh*t out of our bullies. That will surely end it. Oops! Maybe violence isn't the best way/answer for this, but it sure does help out a whole lot.

I often think about all of the people that have, will & would do anything for money.

Are they bad people for going the extra mile for that extra cash? Some would say yes, definitely. Others would disagree. And even those few others would do the same as well.

In my other opinion, I have been one of those people that did something for money. Now don't get me wrong; I would not do ""anything"" for money, but I have done some things for it. I'm not that innocent, but I'm not all that dirty either. lol*

I guess given the situation and the amount of cash that was being offered to me I would have to say that I would do something to get it. If I couldn't get it the right way, at least get it somehow, without having to rob a bank or mug somebody.

This series right here, does me good. It makes me smile. It peeks my interests.

Because of this series, I actually want to take time to go and purchase The Southern Vampire Mysteries, also known as The Sookie Stackhouse Novels. Of course to get a much greater and better understanding of all of this.

I have a few many candies & desserts that have made it onto my ""favorites"" list.

Candies: Skittles, Starburst, Twizzlers (strawberry flavored), Nerds, Charms Blow-Pops (all except the grape or blueberry flavor), pixie sticks, Sweddish Fish, Fun Dip, Sour Patch Kids (various kinds), M&M's (regular - milk chocolate, and they once had packs that had something else in it but i can't remember what it was), Lindt Lindor's White Chocolate, and a few more that are evading my memory banks & thoughts. lol*

Desserts: Cake> Strawberry Cheesecake (strawberry, pineapple and a few other flavors) [but I can only eat it from either when my mom bakes it, or usually from Junior's, and this diner in the rotten apple (Manhattan, NYC). lol* Other then those two, I also like Red Velvet, and a variety of other cakes as well. Cookies> Some Oatmeal Raisin, Chocolate Chip & Peanut Butter Chip. Milk Chocolate Brownies. Pies> Sweet Potato, Apple, Strawberry Ice Cream Pie and on occasion Cherry. Oh I do love me some Peach Cobbler. Oh and I can't forget to mention a host of different flavors of Ice Cream> Strawberry, Strawberry Cheesecake, Gold Medal Ribbon, Vanilla and some of the Ben & Jerry combined flavors. Donuts> Glazed, Chocolate Glazed, Boston Cream, Bavarian Cream, Old Fashioned, Apple-n-Spice, etc. Muffins> Blueberry, Apple & Cinnamon & some others. Banana Pudding. Fruit Cocktail. And good ole Pound Cake with either Strawberry or Vanilla Ice Cream.

Ugh, okay that's about it for the time being. I can't think anymore. haha*

"event","Another day I get to see & enjoy. 

I think that sometimes we take for granted the little things that are really big things that we are blessed to have. Like for example: seeing another day. Because who says that we'll get to see the sun & the moon rise and set again. I just think that it's just purely amazing. 

And also to actually see it. With so many blind people out there, they can't enjoy it in the same way that we can. Maybe their way of ""seeing"" it is fantastic [for them] but they still don't see it like we do. And for that I do have to say that we are truly blessed.

I'm definitely thankful that I was able to wake up today to see another day.

Yeah, been there went through it and pretty much still going through it. My relatives (a big chunk of them) are bullies. So I guess I can say that I've been being bullied my whole life. And for what reason, because I'm not like them. I'm different, I don't like the things or do the things that they like or want me to do. Because I've always been quiet and kept to myself. If i didn't want to play with some another one or few would bully me into playing with the ones I didn't want to play with. Sad? Yes, extremely. 

Other then that, in school, I was only bullied once, but that ended quick after me and the kid (whom was bigger than me) had a fight out on the school basketball court. Of course other kids crowded around to see. And to be completely honest, I did lose that fight. He was more stocky and my blows just weren't making as much of an impact as his blows against me were making. After that day, well more like a week or two, we became friends, but that doesn't mean that he was now my best friend. He was more of a friend that I just casually said ""hi"" to when I passed him. I take it after that fight, we just created a mutual respect for each other. He knew that he could never pick on me again and that if I had to I would fight him again, and I knew that he would never pick on me again since I wouldn't back down from him.

Dealing with relatives that bully you is a whole different story. I'm not completely far from it, but it still happens. Not as ofter as it did when I was much older but it's being done in a more sneaky way, where as they think that I don't see it (and actually I've seen it since it started happening years ago). Now, for the most part, I just don't speak to any of them. I keep to myself. But kinda hard, when I live with some of them and this house is usually ground central for many of the other ones to gather at. So that in itself presents a challenge that will not end until I move out. This time for good, never to look back on this place or these people again.

Well, I really wouldn't want to give up an of my 5 senses, because they are a blessing to me. They help me to function throughout the day. Every day & every night.

But seeing as this is only a ""survey"" of the sorts. I'd have to say that I would give up the sense of taste.

Why taste? Well because to me it's not all that important as the other ones. For example, I would never give up seeing something, or hearing something, let alone smelling something. And touching is something that well, eh I like a lot. With tasting, I guess I'd only be losing the ability to say that something is good to my taste buds. It would be kinda hard to eat things without being able to actually taste them, but at least I'd be able to see & smell them."

"event","So it looks like Miss Irene is definitely on her way. Her prediction was (as usual via the weather channel and many other reports) off. 

First she was said to get here (NYC), by Friday night, but of course that didn't happen. Then it was reported that she would be here all day Saturday, and well the most so far today has been in & out scattered showers. They also said that she would come between tonight and tomorrow. I'm actually betting on that report, since it seems like it's actually happening.

Now not like I really wanted to go anyplace today, but still for Mayor Bloomberg to shut down MTA completely... that was kinda not needed. I mean, we've been through much more rain & even a blizzard that blanketed us with snow, but the MTA was still running. And I believe like my grandmother mentioned, that he and the MTA's heads are going to use this as a reason to up the fare. This will give them that just cause & right to do so. Seeing as it's been a struggle to get the cost to be risen (in what they would call their attempt to help out New York's huge deficit)which is just another way to get more money (like they need more) With all the actual New Yorkers that live & work in this city, plus the workers that come in from New Jersey, Connecticut & even some that make it in from Philadelphia; that coupled with the tourist from other states and those coming in from other countries & you're telling the people that you still don't have enough money? Stop frontin'! If you don't pocket so much of it and actually put back in from your own big piggy banks then the problem would be solved. Would have been solved a long time ago.

This city which is such a powerhouse among the greatest cities in the world can't find a way other then raising the transit fares every year or two to make it? Are you really going to tell me that that's the only way?? 

But yeah back to this being an scapegoat for the bug-heads to raise the fare on the MTA. 

Anyways, I'm bored. I'm sober. I'm home with relatives that get on my nerves. I'm stuck in Queens for too many hours. This is so not going to be a fun weekend at all. And this morning Bloomberg said on the news how the last few trains running would be final around noon. Just my luck that I woke up just about noon-ish and didn't hear about that until almost 1pm. So my luck backfired on me today. If I would had known about this nonsense crap, I would have had my butt up earlier in the morning and on the train into Manhattan to stay with my friends. 

I'd rather be stuck in a house with them then to be stuck here in a house with people I really don't like. I probably even could have gotten my friend to run to the nearest liquor store to get some bottles, because you know of course during something like this, it would be most boring to be with people and be sober. Maybe I should have done like one of my thoughts wondered about. Get my behind up after I went to the supermarket, and instead of making myself something to eat, I should have been getting some clothes together to get out of here with. And then hopped myself on the train and into Manhattan. At least I would have been snuggled between two warm bodies in the night (although I would have provided all the heat for the both of them, since my body gives off so much heat when I'm asleep, lol*)

Ugh, this rain & wind keeps knocking out & playing with my internet signal. I wanna scream right now. Ha!"

Hmm, I don't really think I can bring up to memory any advice that my father ever shared with me (since I was born) that I didn't already know, heard before or understood as being utterly pointless and  stupid.

But I'm not upset or mad at that. And I'm definitely not jealous of other kid out there that seemed o or may have seemed like they had a much more loving, caring, affectionate & nurturing father then I did (do).

That person would probably be my mom. I don't really know why I choose her, but something just screams in my head that she would/should be my first guest. I guessing she would be my start to a really good talk show. My mom is all kinds of weird, loving, crazy & just character-down.

There are so many things that I used to do when I was younger back in the day.

From sitting up real close to the television while playing Nintendo or while watching Thundercats, He-Man, Transformers, She-Ra, G.I.Joe, Silverhawks, etc. Dancing with my aunt to the sounds of Madonna, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Prince, SaltNPepa, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Big Daddy Kane, De La Soul, etc. All the block parties were on my block in Brooklyn (cause that's where I'm from - born and raised).

Oh I can't forget about running around with a towel tied around my my neck acting like I was Superman. Eating salad like it was going to disappear. I used to eat mainly just the lettuce and cucumber & drown it in french dressing. Eating avocado with vinegar, pickled pickles in the bag, deviled eggs, pig feet (from in that clear jar that they used to and might still have at bodegas), not to mention always in the kitchen with my grandma. Whenever she was making a cake, I'd be right there next to her, just waiting for her to ask me if i wanted to lick the rest of the cake batter out of the mixing bowl that didn't drop into the baking pan. Mmmm, mm those were some fun, hilarious days.

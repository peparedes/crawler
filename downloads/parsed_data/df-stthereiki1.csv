"event","Well my weekend was interesting to say the least... Friday I went to the POWERS meeting and did crafty stuffs. Fun but Brandon drove me up the fucking walls...he makes me wonder if kids are a good idea for me GAAAH! Well I called Derek the Lyon earlier on Friday cuz it was his b-day *yayness* or rather by the time he called me he wasn't so good...I offered to leave the meeting to hang out with him...he absolutly refused! Grrr I wanted out of there and well he was depressed. I ended up just talking online for the majority of the night. On Saturday I decided at about 11:30 to get dressed and go down town since my wonderful mother decided to ditch me for the beggining of my b-day. I went to the palace and played pool till about 1am, a co-worker from the U bought me my first shot...kinda was awkward cuz I don't know her that well. oh well! well about 1:05ish I decided it was about time to go to Amvets... I got there and got ID...paid the cover, went to the bar and the bartender asked what I wanted and I said something that was kinda sweet that I couldn't taste the alochol and he gave me a vodka and OJ for my free drink. I saw Kris, Bryce and some other gentleman that I don't know the name of. I sat their for a minute and saw a guy that I had hooked up with a few times. but I didn't really want to talk to him just wanted to sit there. Then Mouse as I call him yelled at me and I went and started talking to him cuz I hadn't seen him in 4 months and well his phone was canceled. Throught the next hour he told me that he though I seemed older( intoxication) and that he had cancer, then we both had a shot of Jager and he got another beer and me a shot of butterscotch snapps. some guy gave me a spank with that paddle and complained that I didn't flinch...he missed and i didn't feel it! Anyway I ended walking to Mouse's house and well both feel down a wet grassy hill laughing all the way down. We got to his place and I slept over there...couldn't drive! Sunday was okay...went to b-fast with mom and Kona, played cards all day and had Easter dinner together. Today I don't know I was fine till about lunch...I guess things with Mouse's cancer were starting to take me over...Maddy asked me something and I was an ass and said I was worried about a mutal friend who had cancer and then she looked at me funny so I told her...she isn't doing great so I in essence dragged down...damn me for being a self=centered aries prick! Honestly I had a crush on Mouse and well he told me he didn't want to date...he asked me out at the bar, I am so confused cuz I kinda like Dave but I am getting the hollow feeling I get when things go south in a relationship and well..I don't need to finish. But it seems the last 2.5-3 years since my Aunt died on my b-day/easter the more I care for people they get sick and either die or commit suscide. I am beggining to wonder what I am here for if that is all I have to live for is to see people die, then the hell with it! I am scared to get close to people for two reasons...as stupid as they are: 1. They gonna cheat on me 2. I care greatly for them and they get cancer and die. Well where do I go from here? It would be easier just not to feel, but that is just something I keeping failing at...among other things. well I think I am going to go sink a little deeper without taking you all with me..."

Goody I get a color label...BLUE!!! one fav out of two go me!

<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/R/rosemckay/1114654048_esktopblue.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""BLUE""><br>BLUES are motivated by INTIMACY, seek opportunities
<br />to genuinely connect with others, and need to
<br />be appreciated. They do everything with
<br />quality and are devoted and loyal friends and
<br />employers/employees. Whatever or whomever
<br />they commit to are their sole (and soul)
<br />focus. They love to serve and will give
<br />freely of themselves in order to nurture
<br />others lives.

BLUES, however, do need to be understood. They have
<br />distinct preferences and occasionally the
<br />somewhat controlling (but always fair)
<br />personality of a confident leader. Their code
<br />of ethics is remarkably strong and they
<br />expect others to live honest, committed lives
<br />as well. They enjoy sharing meaningful
<br />moments in conversation as well as
<br />remembering special life events (i.e.,
<br />birthdays and anniversaries). BLUES are
<br />dependable, thoughtful, nurturing, and can
<br />also be self-righteous, a bit worry-prone,
<br />and emotionally intense. They are like
<br />sainted pit-bulls who never let go of
<br />something once they are committed. When you
<br />deal with a BLUE, be sincere, make an effort
<br />to truly understand them, and truly
<br />appreciate them.

     I can still remember our first day. Running to my next class in the rain, I had gotten into another theoretical conversation with Professor Feezweld. I see your figure there half in the shadows always finishing off a cigarette. 

""Late again Huh? Waiting to have  me walk you into class?"" 

""N-no! I got stuck with my last Professor."" I can feel my heart racing. My hands feel so weak along with my knees.

""Hmmm, Okay whatever you say."" Laughter colors you rich baritone voice...My heart Melts again.

I mutter thanx shyly, for some reason my throat tightens, like the collar my mother made me wear when I got into trouble. Out of the shdows that you were staying hidden in, Your tall form slides gracefully out of tem makeing no noise except the sizzle of you cigarette as it hits the wet ground turning into a littered peice of trash. I think of all the trash I have picked up this morning. I bend to pick it up, I feel as though I am being watched... being touched or rather...stripped of my clothing! Nervously I snatch up the spent cigartte, while wondering who is paying such close attention to me, I swear we are the only ones here. Rigidly I stand normal, for a second, a flash rather, I swear I see you smile. A tear falls gently from my eyes, and trickles slowly over my puffy swollen cheaks, finally dripping off my shin onto the polished wood. I smile in my pain and think...""And that is what started everything.""

""Hey...don't blame yourself for it!"" says another familar voice, falsey comforting a broken heart.

""MMM, I am not. Just remembering the day we met for the first time."" I say trying to choak back the tears.

""Awww Honey, come here, dry those tears. Remember he only wished for your happiness, that is why it happened and don't feel bitter...I don't...Hmmm funny I am his mother and I am not bitter. I figured he would die to either help someone or by falling down the stairs in old age! Now look at me. Tell me before I go that you don't still blame yourself!""

""I don't, I just miss him so much.."" I say weakly

""We all do honey, Take care and call when you get home, I want to know that you are safe.""

""I will, Talk to you later tonight"" I try to sound normal, but it still comes out so soft and weak.

""Okay honey""

I stand there staring at the slack pale face of my boyfriend. Flashing in my mind is his expression he had when he died in my arms out in the alley of our favorite dance club. We had just left, walking close like we always did. Then all of a sudden a yeall that we both looked to see the source, he wraps himself around me with his body with his back to the evil man who already was raiseing the gun, taking aim and pulling the trigger.BANG!BANG!BANG! Rings out. And running footsteps, he looks into my eyes, kisses me and says "" I love you, always smile and remem.."" that was the last thiing he spoke. His body started to slip and I clutched it to let him down slowly, hopeing against a hope that my worst fear wouldn't be true. Now laying in my arms on the ground I look over his body in a panic and I see two holes in his chest with blood gurgleing out. With one hand I grab my cell phone and call 9-1-1 with the other I try to taunch the bleeding in his chest.

""9-1-1 What is your Emergency?"" Says a woman in a chessy voice. GAH!

""M-My Boyfriend just got shot!""

""Okay Stay calm, how many times? Pulse? Breath? Stay calm it will be alright! What is your location...nevermind cell phone! I am dispaching an ambulance now!"" The women's voice is just a buzz but I try to answer her torrent of questions.

""Ummmmm three...I think...slight pluse...OMG he isn't breathing!""

I see the pool of his blood expanding out all around the wounds and onto me. Slowly time goes by and they still aren't here, the blood goes even slower and then no longer seem to a have a flow at all. I just sit and stare at his beautiful face, the bright sky blue eyes now a dull slate gray. The black hair just long enought to run my hands through freely matted and sticky, his red lips are now a unnatural pink fleshy color, his creased forehead now is smooth, taking away part of his character. I cry in disbelif because your gone, I know this but I still hold you close and hope the EMT's can save your life. We know the rest...you died, 1:13 AM October 30th, 2005.

""I know you will be close to me, for the rest of my life. I promise to keep smiling and I'll remember the happy times we had together. I smile the most when we meet up again."" I whisper. I slowly turn and walk toward my car. I stop ar the last hill and look into the November setting sun and tell myself that my sorrow will end when the sun no longer lights the sky tonight. Still I will always love and remember you. With that I cry and drive, not sure where I am going, just driving like we had done so many times before as the sun set  on the Western horizon.

I have been flirting with the idea of suscide for the last couple of weeks. No matter what I do people seem to only be unhappy around me and I just feel that I am a waste of energy in their lives, the one thing I care most about is that my frineds are happy but I seem to only bring them pain and unhappiness so what is the reason I should even be around anymore? I have no hope anymore I don't think that I can ever be the way I want nor a useful person in anybodies life, If i am to be cursed with being alone then the hell with this thing that is called life! The party at Kari's was interesting...I poured hot wax on myself and it felt weird, Moses licked cholate frosting off me ( unerving), I faked a orgasm-well what a guy can do anyway, and drank a little. At the end I felt out of place and that I shouldn't be there much less around anymore. I am even to the point that I am faithless for myself and all that I hold dear. I just feel like I am wrapped in the darkness and I know that there is truly no one who really honestly cares if I fade away, all will say otherwise but I am so sick of the ulterior motives. I just don't want to be here anymore and yet I still can't say good-bye, I wish I knew kept me here so that I could just elminate it then I can just disappear and everyone will just go on, happy and safe."

Well I had a interesting weekend...So lets start with Friday, It was boring until I got back to the UC for the POWERS party which was fun and very interesting with all the costumes...rainbow bright, vampire sluts and pirates, hags, homo-fairies, weblings, will smith etc. That was fun I was even wiliing to give a tarot reading for the costume contest...I lost to Nickola by one vote on the sexiset, meh I never stood a chance. 
Okay left from POWERS and went home and to bed...oh and Alice drew on the webbing at the time during the party, I was 90% naked in the Lambda office...creeps!

Okay so Saturday I was a dork. I told Ryan I would help set up the dance at 2-3ish and so I got there and we didn't get much done...Then I rushed off to a meeting that I needed to go to which was fun but I was late and diddn't meet some people that I was supposed too. Work kinda sucked but I wrote a angroganous story I just have to finish it. So lets fast foward a bit... I went and parked the car then went to Amvets to meet up with Kari and a few other people, I was going to go down but ehh nope they wouldn't let me event though 18-20 can be in a bar till 10pm leagaly, oh well small loss there. I walked to the Lambda dance and got asked by alot of people what I was doing with the giant spider! fun fun and some girls asked me wheather the webs went down further and I showed them some. ANyway got to the dance and changed out to just pants and danced for a bit and there was this cutie  just standing theier so I grabbed someone and said lets make him come out and dance...Decker he be and wowie! yeah I ended up spending most of the night either holdiing his hand, hugging him, kissing him, or just being close. They let me take my pants off at midnight and I think josh almost had a coronary! I think that alot of people just about had a coronary when I walded into the green room... I think that some were quiet pissed. oh well I got Miss Jade's approval at that is AWESOME! I think genusis is pissed that I was hangaing out with Decker so much since they live in the same complex. Anyway I had red prints on my ass later, cuz of all the slapping. So me and Decker left the dance a bit early and went to his apartment and watched a movie...yes people really actually watched a movie. After we started kissing and we went to bed and only cuddled and kissed, it was nice to be with someone and not be expected to have sex. We got up and showed toghether and then he dropped me off at my car and we swapped #'s and then he went to work I went home.

Sunday.. was boring went to Lolo and worked for frank. Came home and started dinner for mom and kona and I . I felt like a third wheel and got a bit depressed when they kissed and I saw them toghether.. more so I got lonely felt like I was in the house all alone without anything or motivation whatsoever. I am torn because I can't understand why I let myself get this way I am still a bit depressed over the situation. I feel dirty and horrible because some people told me at the dance that I looked disgusting I think was the term, I feel really bad... People were horified to see another part of me... the bold sexual me apparently that is not acceptable... not even to some of my colsest friends. hmmmm I don't know what to do I just feel down and it is my fav. holiday but I just can't seem to get into the spirit of things.. I think I might write a poem not sure though...I feel small and insignifagant, yeah I feel stupid in thinking that i wouldn't bother people with my costume...meh I don't have to let anyone guess what is under the clothing anymore..well except for the privates but... still hmm I guess I'll just shut up and hope I can cope with it."

I am wondering if mom is okay but she ain't talking about it...oh well I hope that she will find someone again. Yeah still not feeling so hot I think I am going to just sit out on the ti-chi today. And as for my lab I don't know I think I will just take the test and leave. also it turns out that, the NYC director is real and valid...I am not really sure weather to be flattered or freaked out!"

"event","Okay so I over did it again and I am sick...cold I think. A couple of days ago a guy e-mailed me and asked if I was in porn...wow never thought that would happen. I have been swinging in and out of depression since Steven dumped me and I don't know why. And honestly by the way I am tired of this emotional rollercoaster...even with all of the lovely events ie. local beatings and such I am really stressed and I am over doing my body into fits of revolt. I am looking forward to the dance but I am not sure I should go due to the fact that 2 out of 3 ex's will be there more worried about the recent then the latter(yes tyler this is you) one. I hope he doesn't do any thing stupid(steven) and gets himself abused or anything...why do I care about my last abuser? I don't get it I am just loseing it I guess. Today we had the meeting of Colatlion against hate. and I opened my big mouth and wham! like a punch to the gut not only am I nervous cuz my prof. from Abnormal Psyc. was there but I put myself on display as a puching bag for not reporting the incidents yet...I think that I should bow out of the coalition cuz I know that I am getting ignored because of the report thing and since I got growled at about the LACK of SECURITY at the next Lambda dance, when I mentioned that one or two cops will do no good I think that the board is pissed at me for that. Oh well I guess I will never fit in there either, I guess I should just nnot be as openly concered for the community I am in . I just don't know I hurts me to think that I am not even accepted fully in the community that I belong in. Well I am beging to think FUCK YOU TOO!"

"event","Okay so yesterday Tyler cornered me and wanted to talk, well I was still shaken from the events of our wonderful city. Anyway he wanted to tell me that basically he wanted to try again and people think that we broke up for the wrong reason... The reason why according to my so called friends was because of MY LACK OF THE ABILITY TO COMIT TO A RELATIONSHIP. You know that is a bunch of BS if they thought about though I was denying that I was Gay at the time I DID have a year relationship with Joann, Personally if you don't know someone you SHOULDN'T assume the usual that the personn who broke it off has comition issues. It hurts me to think that not even my own Goddess....Friends don't think that I can comit to a relationship and that they so brazenly assume that since I broke up with Tyler after 3 weeks, and Steven did dump me people I didn't dump him ALSO Rae dumped me too after a month(rae only), so how am I the bad guy huh? Shit why do you people perpetuate my feelings of uslessness and unworthyness to be here, by saying things like that? Will you explain that to me?!That is if you can."

So yeah Sunday was interesting, not really it actually sucked really bad. I went to the studiopresents dance with Steven and that turned out to be a hellish experiance, he got drunk  and pretty much molested two women, and became belligerant, long story short he was a giant asshole and drank almost a fifth of vodka.

I hope that worked... anyway I was talking to this guy on the internet for about 6 months and we kinda hit it off as friends. Well things have developed where he and I are going to meet at Liquid Planet before we go to the dance...so this could be interesting cause I think he wants me but the reasons I am not shure...that bothers me a little bit so I am a little nervous about Sat. Oh well I will be in my comfort zone at the dance so things should be okay I hope. Well i went down to the Bookstore to get a binder for my A+P lecture class and found out that my battery on my labtop might destroy my computer due to reports of massive overheating. So I have to go home and get it so i can solve the problem here on campus and so I will miss 1.5 of my classes today but that really doesn't bother me cause I can get the notes off the internet...He he he! anyway that is all for now...actually I told Kona about the guy and this Sat and she thinks is good and cute which I find funny. Kona is kinda like a second Mom I love it!"

"event","Okay so I thought things were fine when my Aunt called like oh 4 times . NOT! anyway she wouldn''t just spill the beans and tell me what was wrong she just HAD to talk to my mom. Well mom got home about 7 tonight and I tell her that my Aunt had called 4 times and wouldn't tell me anything which i acidly said 'like she would anyway' which took my mom by surprise. Well mom calls and I know she is pissed, well as it turns out my Grandmother is in the hospital again but she was admitted thursday, which there was no reason for them not to call. Well mom and my aunt got into it over the phone, me on the other hand went downstairs to stay out of the way. Well mom then decided to call my grandmother while she was pissed and told her I am tired of being pushed around by Wanda(my aunt) and ya de ya de da and so they blew up at each other and it is all my mom's fault for my aunt being a slef-centered bitch. I was planning on having a silent nice evening...didn't happen mom turned into super bitch. I wish i could just wring my aunt and grandmother's necks! They do this all the time...she goes in the hospital and we are the last to know. Oh well Maybe I should get disowned by coming out to them...hmmmm. I will think on that. Anyway hopefully life will become better."

"event","Well I enjoyed the party on sat/sun night, I am sorry for those that were there though I noticed that not only was I half gone but happy I was comming off the prednisone which made me not myself so as things turn out I am still coming off the prednisone and now I am depressed for no bloody reason at all! I looked up the effects and it is just the withdrawl from that peticular drug so hopefully tomarrow will be normal...LOL whatever that may be. I have a really OLD profile with outpersonal.com and I got a e-mail from a guy on campus and so I figured the hell with it and e-mailed him back with my cell #. Well he called me yesterday and we meet up at alberson's before he had to go run some errands and go meet with some friends he had plans with. I was nice to meet him and as it turns out I have been wanting to talk to himm but just plainly doubted my gaydar and well I have chicked out talking to him, so that was a nice twist to the day. All we did was try and figure out what exactly what we were going to do but that proved to be kinda fruitless since it was really close to the time he needed to go meet up with his friends and the fact that alot of places closed early cuz it was labor day sunday. so not much happened and he is going to call later today or tomarrow and we will see if we can hang out sometime again. I hope so I have kinda been watching him for a while wondering if I was getting the right feeling from my gaydar and so it turns out I was right!! whoot! and well we shall see! anyway I will talk to you all later. And sorry about you exploding last night(2 nights I guess)! I know it wasn't my fault but still I feel bad! Meh yes I know I worry to much!"

The Surprising Lover
54% partner focus, 28% aggressiveness, 60% adventurousness  
Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that: 

You prefer your romance and love to wild and daring rather than typical or boring, you would rather be pursued than do the pursuing and, when it comes to physical love, your satisfaction comes more from providing a wonderful time to your partner than simply seeking your own. 

This places you in the Lover Style of: The Surprising Lover. 

The Surprising Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and, like the name implies, is often filled with hidden delights and talents that might not be apparent from a surface knowledge of the person. The Surprising Lover is rather like a geode--sometimes rough on the exterior, but filled with beauty and wonder. The Surprising Lover is thus a gem to find, though it can sometimes be difficult to do so because they often tend to be humble and unwilling to reveal their inner greatness unless they're in a rewarding relationship. 

In terms of physical love, the Surprising Lover really shines, often highly imaginative and utterly devoted to bringing the heights of pleasure to the one that they truly love. Given a rewarding, reciprocative relationship, and the right lover, the Surprising Lover can be a delight in bed. 

Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Carnal Lover (most of all) or the Exotic Lover, or the Suave Lover. 
 
I don't know though I think the person kinda is nuts who wrote it but I does work to some extents."

Derek seems way under the weather and though I just don't know details it seems like I am part of the problem some how...I wonder if I did some thing that made him unhappy but for some reason I stop myself when I go to ask...Like it ain't none of my business and that I should just buzz off. I am really happy to see him since I really missed him I just don't have the energy to bounce over and jump him to say HI! yet but when I do mwahahaha! that and It seems that alot of people are kinda avoiding me for some reason but after what I had I can see why, but I am not contagous anymore so... Lets hangout!!! but seems like that is against everybodies religon all of a sudden and I am begining to wonder weather I should even try to hang out seems like no one can, but then I hear about things from other people oh well I have been entertaining myself alone for almost 20 years why not another...just alot better with other people that i think I can call friends not sure if I can shit I go out with someone and now I am like a giant bio-fucking- hazard but if some else just fuck a bunch they are fine I don't really get that?!

Update Two :'''((
Well since the relationship was long distance Rae told me that we needed to break up and just be friends...and maybe we could start agian after he moved back. But in my heart I don't think it will happen... I mean he was High on 'E' when I asked him out AND he cheated on me I mean I don't know weather I can stand another 'secret' like that again...I can't do this anymore...shit I am a Jezabel and a loser...I know josh you don't think I am and all that It just hurts so much I feel like getting drunk and then I don't know something self-destructive."

"event","So people lets rewind I thought my mom might be attracted to Kona...well I got the answer today...not supposed to tell people but oh well at least she told me! Yes she likes Kona in a lesbeian fashion but she is sooo fucking confused cause it is only Kona...or so she says anyway in short they are going out yayness but mom is going to stay in the closet to the family and well she will come out as she is ready to her friends! Well I have thinking...I know the smoke rolls in, I am not sure weather Rae and I should go out..here is why not only was he high when he said yes to going out, cheating on me, rushing things, pushing me, driving me nuts with the want for stories and well in general if he cheated on me before why not again same with the drugs...He calls anywhere from 2 to 10 times a day and wonders why I have nothing to say. I think he just wants a FWB instead cause of the distance,but I just don't know if I can trust him now I mean he has new 'secrets' to tell me every week! I just don't really know if I asked him to go out with me because I was lonely or weather...I just don't know! I am just getting more and more frustrated I mean come on he cheated on me once will he do it again, no he says but I just don't know I probably will pay for typing this cause one of somebody will tell him, well thanx for making life harder for me early!"

"event","Okay well life is confuseing lately! Okay so Nickola is back which is a yayness thing! that is the chinchilla part not all of the lesbian part. Okay so my dad e-mails me and asks how much my books were going to cost and well I told him so he e-mails me back telling me they will send the money and also that they are happy I didn't take so long...whatever that means. My mom I think suspects that me and Rae are going out...no biggie i think. Well here is the lesbian part a friend came over and helped us put a patio up/down and well she is a lesbian. no biggie she is a blast well she told my ma and mom seems fine. Well Kona is her name and she was gone for the last week and mom said she 'missed' her even though they talked like every two days. Well while we were doing the patio kona stayed here at the house and first night was down stairs and well the next three were upstairs...I think with my mom...no evidence she slept anywhere else. So as things go I know that Kona will spend the night tonight...but we were going to watch 'monster' together and well they headed straight for mom's room and her bed...sheets up thank you. Well I left early. .. claiming sleepyness, Well they are still together in mom's room and I don't think that Kona will be leaving tonight either... I wonder if my mom is going lesbian because she is curious and I am gay? not sure but the two of them act like they are a little more then friends...I am just so confused cause she seems so I am NOT a lesbian...oh well maybe that will be a good thing for me if mom is! Strange...anyway talk to you all later."

"event","Okay so this is a little old...anyway things got fine b/w rae and the guy he was going to come over with. Well the timeing of Rae comming over was not so great for me but I guess that happens. Well I got off work like 5 min. early and went home and changed to do stone cutting with my mom for our patio which ended up a 4 day event. anyway they came over and said hi and met my mom and a woman who was helping. Well Mike wanted a pic of Rae and me even though I had stone-water all over my body...well Rae didn't touch me really...he is kinda a princess which is fine. anyway apparently I wasn't happy enuf to see him and well I was pulled b/w seeing Rae and the obligation to get the patio done with the other two. He left upset. I got a call from him and well he was pissed and I don't blame him I was a space cadet cuz I also just got another job and I am quitting the Cracker Barrel anyway, so apparently he had a emotional break down on the way back to butte. Well I called him the next day when I got the chance and would you know no ans. So I talked to him two nights ago and he told me since that he thought I was gooing to break up with him he ""fooled around with someone"". that hurts alot but I guess I deserve it a little bit but the way he acted it was like he fucked the guy! so that hurt still does but as things go I told him not to worry about it, it was my fault that he felt in such a mannner that he did that. I do feel at least responsible! anyway I find that when I came out to my mom she didn't hear me and well now I have to come out to here again and I just don't really am depressed it was hard enuf to do the first time and now I have to start ant the begging all over again.:'-( So on top of that my grandmother is getting sick again and I am also to insecure and I need to fix that problem apparently. I worked  yesterday and one of my bosses told me that "" I am going to run you (like a dog) until your done with your shift"" my Goddess I can't stand that! The one boss that came out to me wants me to help him find someone, and I am thinking if I can't hold a b/f what make him think I can find him one! I just want to scream and self-mutalation sounds  more and more tempting! I also wrote two 'poems' about this shit anyway here are the links...

"event","Well you know the answer if I were kidding! Well I talked to Rae like at 1:15 this morning and he was going to come over tomarrow!! *sigh happly* any way  I went to bed and when I woke up their was a urgent message. It said we need to talk and it was like shit what is going on now! well as it turns out he is pissed at the guy he was going to come over with anyway it looks like he will be here and gone in the course of the time i am at work and so I won't get to see him..:'-( So as things go he wants me to come to butte as soon as I can but I don't have the money and well I have responsibilities i have to attend to here. Well his friend Cory is like I will give you the money to get here and back but I am thinking that my car won't make the trip again much less do I feel comfortable takeing money from him since I don't really know him. I just think it is odd that he wants me over there so bad that his friend whant me to come over just as bad. I am wondering what the hell did I get myself into...Meh otherwise I can't wait to get back to normal semester I am going to go nuts if I have the day that we start wrong!"

WRONG! I couldn't for some reason and I don't understand like I feel I need to but I just kan't. something stops me but if I write it I have no problem. Well I called and told him I wasn't able to tell her and I was sorry for not being able to. Later he called me and told me not to worry that he didn't want to push me to do things if I wasn't ready then it isn't a problem! WOW and I also have the ability to help make the decisions in the relationship and that he didn't want to control everything. Honestly I am relived but I am also terrified I am not used to having control over thing like this and I don't want to f**k it up but I feel that is all I can do...AHHHHHHHHH! I don't want to give up but I am so lost I just don't know what to do anymore. I have no logical reason for not telling my mom that he is my b/f but I still can't...I just wish I knew why"

"event","Okay so I am  at work on sunday and i know that their would be a little backlash from me comming out at Cracker Barrel but it had to be done. Well one of the male emploee's goes hey Ian I want to show you something!, do you want to see?,
Not really if it comes from you.
Then he reached  under his apron by then I was upset and I heard the zipper move and I got pissed off and lets just say that not even my managers would willingly come near me. I am still pissed I was so angry that I kept seeing myself getting a butcher knife and cut the f**cker's head off! Anyway Rae was going to come over sunday but I lost my phone and when he called i couldn't get ahold of him cause i didn't have the phone and when he callled last night I found my phone cause he left a message and it vibrated against the bar on bottom of my seat(car). Anyway yesterday I went to work thinking I might get out at a decent time but no they wanted to make me close by myself so I was pissed off about it I mean the work that usually requires two people or mare they wanted me to do all that work by myself and no one would help me. I was so ready to walk out! But about midnight two servers and the big manager started helping me out but I felt as though I couldn't cut it I mean I had to get help for Ea's sake I mean If i needed that much I must be a pretty bad worker...so  i find my phone after work and the Message rae left was 'we need to have a little talk' It was like well since things are going to hell I guess this is a good time for him to dump me! anyway I called and got his message phone and I told him that I was sorry and that I had lost my phone, if he wanted to end the relationship that would suck but if that is what he wanted fine since I apparently can't cut it at work wy shouold I be able to cut it as a boyfriend and he probably deseved better anyway. Well he called back and said son't worry about it since I lost my phone and shit happens! and he a had a nuts weekend he never made it to missoula. well gotta go, call Rae andget ready for work. I am applying for another job at the U so we will see when I will burn out! I think I have already started. Oh well no big loss if I do."

I went to the dance on Sat...the after party that is, apparently I made a mistake and I did good things...sorta. I went not expecting to meet anyone, I mean I probably couldn't pick anyone up, well you showed me wrong! 


anyway out of that format! Hey all I went to the afterparty this last Saturday and I have to say I had fun, but apparently I just found out that I was a shitty friend for not noticing that something was way wrong. I went to the party and ran into Erik and we talked for a little while and then went into the building, well Bryce was there and I paid my money but I am under 21 so i had to be marked, well as luck had it they didn't have a sharpie so I left to go get mine out of the car. When I got back I moved to the front of the line and gave it to bryce well there were people up at the front so I hung back in the next open space. Well this guy eyed me a few times so I eyed back...why not?! Well i though DAMN!I HAVE NO CHANCE IN HELL, BUT WOW! I was let in like fourth or fifth but in the mean time while I waited Josh got to the dance and I knew something was wrong so asked and he kinda said meh! so I just stod there like a  idoit while Mark smiled at me and I looked back like what do you want I think that I made the girl next to him nervous oh well not my prob. So still waiting one of the guys ahead of me is complaining about a ticket he got on the way there and most of us told him to can it evenutally. Later I found myself alone and ran into Josh and we went and sat down in the green room the party hadn't started at all. So since Josh was anti-socal i got up and cheaked out the other room and looked at the people there. Later that evening I just danced alone and I saw the guy from the front dancing kinda alone but sorta near his friends. I figured that I would just dance one song with him and well move on if it was cold his friends were close so why not. Well I spent the rest of the dance with him and then need I say more?! I just recently found out that Josh wanted to talk but instead just let it build out of wack and shit hit the fan. I talked to him but ya know what he said it wasn't my fault, but I still feel like I let him down.

I guess if I wasn't so enamored with the man I danced with...Rae is his name...we decided to go out! yayness anyway maybe Josh's night wouldn't have sucked so bad.

I keep trying to get a hold of the SexyCatBeast but I can't seem to touch up with him all i get is the voicemail and well he calls when I am at work! so we are playing voicemail tag...damn it!"

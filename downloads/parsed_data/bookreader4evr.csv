"event","I cannot believe how incredibly moved I was by the movie I just watched. I was expecting it to be some shallow tryst of a movie with a lot of sex drugs and alcohol, maybe a few shots with less clothes and more action, and a very shallow plot line.

In that sense I was disappointed.

It ended up being a movie about love and loss. About the cards of fate and the unexpected turns in life that no one can predict. It tells a story that is a life. And in that story there were so many truths that I could connect to, that I could feel, that I could believe. Which is why this was such a powerful movie. I connected to the story, I felt that each character was real and that each character had a life, with the joys and sorrows that fill any life. I could relate to their passions and triumphs, and to their failures and disappointments. These were lives. I celebrated as two of these lives overcame great odds to come together. They overcame so very much to realize and embrace their love despite the obstacles. It was a moment of triumph, and the moment when the storybook plot crumbled to dust.

The remainder of the movie was about how one of these people grew sick and died, and the other one stayed by their side through the entire ordeal. They were madly in love, and even though their official time &quot;together&quot; was only a few months, they remained strong for one another until the very end. This was made possible through the support of friends and loved ones.

The scene that tugged my heartstrings the most was after the actual death. The lover of the deceased went to an empty park and screamed in agony. Screamed from the pain that he felt. Screamed to release the pain from losing his other half, his love, a piece of himself.

The point is, they always say that we don&#39;t realize what we have until it is gone. So it is time to take a step back and realize that anyone in your life, anyone, could die today. Whether it be in a car accident or some freak occurrence,&nbsp; the time we have on this earth is numbered. So we had best make the most of it. Love the people closest to you and accept love in return. Don&#39;t judge to harshly, you have no idea what pain others have suffered, Live life to the fullest, and most importantly, be happy with your life. Even if things are not turning out how you planned or as you planned, you can still be happy with the joys and the accomplishments that you have achieved and file the more unpleasant times under &quot;learning experiences&quot;."

"event","It is with a heavy heart that I return to this, my journal. Much has changed over the time since I started this journal. Who knows where I will be if, and when, this journal comes to an end. Regardless, for now, I am in Los Angeles and I am....not happy. I moved out here in the pursuit of happiness. I am not sure what I was expecting. For some reason I thought that everything would be happy and wonderful once I got out here. Yet, life once again maintains its mystery. Happiness remains elusive.

I am unsure as to my motivation in returning to this journal. I simply needed a place to vent, and I suppose this has a semblance of familiarity that helps me feel comforted in the bleak times. Many of my illusions have been recently shattered. I do not feel a driving purpose, and, at worst, feel mainly purposeless. How, in an infinite universe, could my existence possibly have any significance? It is a question that humanity has struggled with since the beginning and have pandered to and softened, but never answered.

What possible significance could we have?

I suppose I should focus on nearer and dearer things. Or just more relevant. I need a new job. I have 2 degrees, over 8 years of office management experience and I work retail. as a sales associate. and I get looked down upon for doing so.

I hate it.

I hate being belittled, looked down upon, or sympathized for because of my job. I am trying to pay the bills. My job does NOT mean that I am stupid, incapable, or incompetent.

Yet, I cannot help but feel that way since every other position seems to be slipping through my fingers.

hmmm. I might need help."

Somehow I havem ade it to my final year of college and I&nbsp;am F-ing it all up. Seriously. I think I have missed 14 days in some of my classes. That being said, I&nbsp;still get good grades on all my assignments showing how pointless attendence is, but when the attendence policy is no more than 3 days....I&nbsp;have problems.

I am trying to take incompletes, but I need a legitimate reason. I don't think they count emotional instability as a legitimate reason. Which sucks.


I&nbsp;need to quit my job. I feel bad though. Yet I know&nbsp;I need to for my own mental health, there is no way I&nbsp;can continue working.

I&nbsp;just wrote a long, rather nasty, email to my father. I&nbsp;basically chewed him out for getting married without consulting me or my brothers. I guess we don't realy have a say in the matter, but it feels like our opinions dont matter at all.

People are getting sick of my instability. They tell me this, like it will help. Obviously, I am MORE sick of my instability. &nbsp;I wish life did not constantly get more and more complicated. WAAAYYY to much stress right now.

I need time to myself. Time to clean. Time to do homework. Time to Sleep. Time to rest.

Currently&nbsp;I have none of that. 18 credit hours, running 2 organizations, and a full time (40 hours) job that I work nightshift for = a crazy, unstable Ashland.

I&nbsp;wanted to see how much I&nbsp;could do at once. I thought there would be a breaking point. Like a tree branch or something, just POP and I would fall. Nope. Instead it it more like a Rock takign on the Ocean. I am slowly wearing away, day by day, and I&nbsp;need to get out of the water.

This guy I&nbsp;met has some serious issues. I don't know what they are, but they are there. He refuses to talk about his family and says he doesn't &quot;trust&quot; anyone. it makes me so angry. I&nbsp;want to be trusted, I&nbsp;want to be liked! Seriously, I have never been so mad at anyone beforei n my life, and I barely know him. What is wrong with me? He told me that he didn't trust me and I seriously was suddenly VERY angry, which was an odd emotional response. I&nbsp;tried really hard to contain it, but ended up lashing out and saying a couple mean things anyway. Now i feel horrible, because he doesnt trust me AND&nbsp;now he won't EVER&nbsp;trust me. And that will bother me until I&nbsp;can forcem yself to forget it.


Sometimes,&nbsp;I envy drug users. At least they find solace somewhere. It might be in the end of a needle, but it is somewhere.

I suppose I am supposed to turn to Jesus, find faith, have hope, trust God to take care of things. But God helps those who help themselves, and I need to figure this one out. Besides, God never actively helps, he works in Mysterious ways these days. I&nbsp;seriously feel like the old testament days would have been easier, then you got fried by lightning if you did something wrong. At least you would know, for sure, that what you did was wrong.

This is one of those HUGE parties that pretty much everyone has been looking forward to. obviously I&nbsp;am the DD.

So anyways, I&nbsp;dropped some people off, went someplace else for a while and came back with more people. The second time I&nbsp;come back I was going to go inside for an hour or so before taking everyone home. Then I&nbsp;found out that I&nbsp;didn't want to stay at all.

Two of the kids there had gotten into a knife fight and one of them was bleeding. All of the people I was driving are underae and so I&nbsp;started to round them up so that we could all leave since I assumed the cops were probably going to be there soon.

Apparently this was not what some of the people I&nbsp;was driving wanted. They were extremely mad at me for wanting to leave and kept saying &quot;it is not a big deal&quot; and that &quot;as long as we stay in another room it wont affect us&quot;. I&nbsp;felt like they were sufficiently drunk for making those comments and they ended up leaving with me....except for one girl who ran away and hid when I&nbsp;suggested we leavve, she got left.

That being said, several of these said persons are still mad at me for &quot;making a big deal about it&quot;. The cops were never called, nor was an ambulance called. The kid who got stabbed was fine, it was just a skin wound. Apparently a girl also broke her nose at this party.....

I have just spent the last 3 hours reading my past entries.&nbsp; Because of this I have fallen in love at least 8 times. The only posts I&nbsp;make private are extremely detailed accounts on what I like about my crushes. I&nbsp;have never gone beack and read what I&nbsp;wrote but I must say that I&nbsp;definately capture the essence of what I like, I am now madly in love with multiple people until they destryo my illusions of them again.

Anywho. Life has been just dandy, Stress has gone down a notch since I decided to take a very light class load. However I feel like I am letting myself down, why go to college and only take the minimum number of courses to be a full student? Granted I took 21 credits last semester and no less than 18 all the semesters prior so I deserve a break.

Sadly, this means I might not get to complete the psychology major that I was looking into.&nbsp;it would mean I wil lmajor in English and Minor in Comparative literature and business.

I love books. I love you too, just for reading this ;-D

"event","I&nbsp;am losing them.

One by one my friends are drifting away. 

With some of the closer ones I can FEEL it, like someone is pulling away a section of my heart. With others I&nbsp;barely notice, and, with the very few I consider quite close, it is like a knife has been jabbed directly into my heart. 

Today, unfortunately, was one of the most painful stabbing losses. It is made worse because it is a FEELING more than anything. There is a point where either I&nbsp;or they back off, and don't come any closer, slowly drifting.

Tonight we fought over the one thing I fight with my friends about the most, girlfriends. They really do cause problems.

So i will give my story, ans maybe I&nbsp;am being unreasonable, and maybe I am not.

My friend calls me at 10 pm and I am already in bed. He asks me to come watch a movie with him, and I agree only because I have not gotten a chance to hang out with him without his girlfriend this entire summer. So&nbsp; I go out and end up spending 5$ renting a movie and then drive the 15 minutes to his house. I go in, we set up the movie, and he whips out his laptop. Throughout the ENTIRE movie he is talking to someone online, much to my annoyance. At the end of the movie I ask him who he is talking with, and he says &quot;My girlfriend, I was trying to wait for the movie to end so I&nbsp;could ask you to leave so we can video chat&quot;.

FML

So I&nbsp;informed him that, while I may not be as important as his girlfriend, my time is still valuable and if he is going to invite me someplace EVER again he had better be willing to actually spend time with me.

He gave me this look that was like &quot;what is your problem&quot; and said &quot;Dude, I want to talk with my girlfriend, I dont get why you are upset&quot;


That is basically my whole story. But it conveyed a disrespect towards me and my time that irritated me to the extreme, and it showed that I&nbsp;was no longer an important person in his life.&nbsp;

I guess I should mention this is NOT an isolated problem but a reoccuring one in which I&nbsp;have never said anything previously."

My friends are pairing off with their significant others and, as time passes, these relationships take up enough time that I&nbsp; am pushed away. Sure I see these people, but it is weekly instead of daily, and NO I am not okay with that.

But it will only get worse. Once my friends start getting married and get Jobs I will see them less and less often and i will be forced to spend more and more time alone.

People say &quot;just wait til you find someone&quot; But I don't WANT to find someone if it means that I have to shut out the rest of my friends. I dont really want to be alone but at the same time I think I might never date. It seems too fake. You act like this person is your whole world, when they are not, and then you spend all your time with them to uphold that lie. 

I think love is a lie. and it is a Lie that I set as my goal in life. I wanted to fall head over heels in love and because of that I have discovered that either Love is a lie, or that I do not have the capability to love conditionally."

which is the motivating factor in my life?

I ponder this as I&nbsp;leave the person I&nbsp;am heavily crushing on at their front doorstep, totally unaware of how I feel. 

Am I Afraid of Rejection?

Or do I love this person too much to leave them behind if that is what they wish, after rejection?

Am I asking the same question?

Is the friendship worth enough by itself to not be put at risk for the possibility of a relationship?

For example: My relationship right now is a house. It provides me shelter. Do I want to gamble my house for the possibility of food? Food is a greater need than shelter, but I could lose the shelter without gaining the food.

Well, Obviously I am home now. And once again I have not acted. Once again I will fall into a friendship that I will want to be more.

They are 5 years older than me, so it probably wouldn't work anyway.
plus they want to move to california.

Neither of which are MAJOR&nbsp;obstacles......but I am utterly and completely afraid.

Do I&nbsp;deserve happiness? and what scale determines that decision? How am I any more qualified to be happy than one of my friends? should I be willing to sacrifice the happiness of a friend in the pursuit of my own happiness?

I say no

Which logically concludes that the person I&nbsp;like could be perfectly happy with a friendship and nothing more, therefore I shouldn't ruin there happiness by imposing my hormonal beliefs upon them.

For example:

&quot;I looked outside this morning at the dreary sky and watched the rain trickle down my window. I&nbsp;sighed as I realized that i would be soaked long before I&nbsp;got to class&quot;

&quot;The rain pattered against my window washing away the grime and getting me started for a new day. The past was behind me and I&nbsp;was ready to stride through the rain and enjoy the rain on my skin and the feel of the mud on my feet.&quot;

Personally,&nbsp;I tend to be closer to the first example, but that is just me.

Anywho, someone posted a note on time, and it got me thinking, so I&nbsp;am going to write about it.

It is amazing to me how fast time seems to have passed, and yet, in each moment, it seems to take forever to progress. I&nbsp;sit in class each day willing time to speed up, and, when it seems like it has, I wonder where all the time went? I have memories from elementary school that feel as though they could have happened yesterday, and memories from yesterday that I have to concentrate to try and recall. 

My favorite memories are, invariably, with my friends.

In middle school, over the summer I&nbsp;have memories of being out on the pontoon with Zach Kendra and we were swimming, there were no cares at all on that day, no obligations nothing, and I was happy.

There are too many memories to mention with Jinelle, Jumping on the trampoline, telling scary stories, Tea with Felicity, The leaf lottery, selling Lemon-aid, walking home form the bus stop and talking :D, stepping into the wet cement of her basement :D. We had such adventures........ 

Kristin Angel, I&nbsp;remember getting into HUGE&nbsp;trouble for being at your house. Well, mainly because my mom called and wanted me home and I hung up on her. However, I must say that my favorite memory with you is when we were in your room and the stupid annoying stuffed animal pet thing was there and it kept screeching something like &quot;I'm Hungry&quot;.

I cant do these all by person, it will take to long, so I&nbsp;will list a few more and leave them be.

Capture the flag at Johns, Amy Abramzyks birthday party, Pink pens, Mr. Miesel, Ms. Hunter, Ms. Greenberg, ect. ect.


However. This is all in the past tense now. I&nbsp;have come to realize that the times when I&nbsp;am truly happy are dwindling. Stress is increasing, expectations are rising. Fear for my future has arisen. 

Yet through all of this I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;have my friends there to support me. They are the foundation of my strength to go on. Not only my friends from L.O but my friends from Indiana as well. I&nbsp;lean on them, sometimes extremely heavily, to get through the day. It is because of this that I&nbsp;try and maintain as many friendships as possible, and I&nbsp;try to recipricate their help by beingas good of a friend as I&nbsp;possibly can be

Oh! IM&nbsp;MR.A!&nbsp; hahaahahh Desitnation imagination

Oh, the random memories. IT is with that thought that I will travel down memory lane, greet old friends, say farewell to long lost friends, and realize that the future is bright as long as I have the right perspective. Each setback, every encounter, every horrible accident, is a stone thrown into a river. who knows how that stone has changed things? but it has at least caused some small change and at most has diverted the river. These things lead to new opportunities while closing the door on other old ones. We must look forward, we must press on, and above all, we must dream and attempt to achieve those dreams. For life is kindest when our dreams are made into reality."

Question: Do you live your life for you or for others?

Answer: Its complicated.



Truly, it is complicated. However I am very inclined to say I&nbsp;live my life for others. I&nbsp;follow the norms of society and do as society demands. Likewise, I keep my parents happy, my friends happy, my siblings happy, my family happy ect ect. I do all sorts of things in life with no goal other than to keep other people happy.

However, I do this for innately selfish reasons. Each person has a different reason, but a reason none-the -less. My friends I&nbsp;keep happy so that they will hang around me more often, my parents I keep happy to milk out more money, my grandparents I keep happy so that I can use them to force a family issue. 

So it is really a give and take.

however, I think I am losing. I am almost certain that the path that I&nbsp;would have been happiest pursuing has been lost to me because of my brothers, and, because of my mother, I forced myself to find a more &quot;practical&quot; plan for my life.

Question: Since when is life &quot;Practical&quot;?

Answer: never has been.

Why do we spend so much time focusing on getting a routine, getting a job, a boyfriend/girlfriend, a schedule. Then we spend the rest of our time COMPLAINING about how BORING it all is. GUESS&nbsp;WHAT! you did it to YOURSELF.

And yet, here I am. Running after a job that will turn into the ceaseless drumming of bees wings searching for pollen. An endless activity in which I become one of many instead of one out of many. As time rushes on dreams are replaced by realities and opportunities are replaced by hard choices and facts of life. 

So think fast, these next few years determine the REST of your life, are you heading where YOU&nbsp;want to go? or are you on the path of least resistance, the journey to the void of unfulfillment? 

It is just a question."

Oh, and I have never told anyone outside of lake Orion my SN on livejournal so you are my privileged audience.

however, the impersonality of our relationships, the distance between us, is what allows us to be honest.

We know that the distance is a buffer; a type of damage control. No matter what we say to each other there can be no repercussions.

I am in a good mood. I have come to realize that writing in this journal makes me feel better, not a whole lot better, but a little bit better. IT is almost like having a friend right at your finger tips who is never bored or tired of what you have to say :D

Freedom.

Think about that word for a minute, what does it mean to you?

to me it means the ability to make your own choices without fear of consequences.

query:
Since almost every action is caused by a previous action, does that mean we don't have freedom, rather, we simply go down the path that a series of events has pushed us towards?"

"event","At what point does trust go out the window as irrelevant? Your best friend tells you a secret which you promise not to tell. However, once it is said, you realize that if you don't tell someone it is going to eat you alive from the inside out. Yet, if you do tell someone you WILL and I repeat WILL lose this friend. the secret has been said in COMPLETE confidence. 

leaving that little bit for though, and moving on to the next subject. Lies. Everyone lies, it is just a fact. Goodness knows I lie. I lie alot, about alot of things. Alot of the time it is about things that don't even matter. To a certain extent it is nice to get a feeling of power when you know that you can alter someone else's perception of truth by telling them a lie in an extremely believable manner. Going along with this subject is white lies. When is it okay to lie to someone to make them feel better? A boyfriend calls up their girlfriend and says that they need to meet up so they can talk. The girlfriend asks ""are you going to break up with me"". If the answer is yes, do you tell her? the whole point of the conversation was to meet up with her to break up with you in person, yet she asked you a direct question, so do you lie? I guess that doesn't fall under a white lie but other things do. I lie when people ask me if I like certain people just because it would be awkward if I said that I DIDN'T like their girlfriend when she is standing 2 feet away. I lie when people ask me about their haircuts and tell them they look great no matter what. They cant really have the hair put back on, now can they?

now life, this isn't all life but a general overview of a couple of brief topics that cannot be categorized in any other manner. First and foremost, to tie in with the previous paragraph, most people live a lie. This is sadly true in very large groups of self proclaimed ""christians"" . Don't get me wrong I believe in christ and I have read the bible, but I am reluctant to categorize myself as a christian for the pure connotations that go along with it. While christians should be known as loving, forgiving, generous, and kind, they are actually known as hypocritical, judgmental, and stingy. So, these christians live their lie of a life. They are not the only ones who live a lie. Many people put on ""masks"" when they around one group of friends as opposed to another. to a certain extent we are influenced by who we are with but some people undergo radical changes. Part of this, I think, has to do with the lies we have told to these different groups. Every time you lie about something you make a mental note to yourself to stay consistent to that lie. so, in essence, you change who you are everytime you lie to someone for the sake of appearances, you dont want to be known as a lier. 

So to tie the three points together, I am just going to make a pretty generic statement that I feel empowered to say if not to act upon. I am tired of living a lie, I am tired of keeping up false pretenses, and I am tired of two faced hypocrites. Now I know that someone out there is saying ""AMEN!"" or ""You tell them"" but in reality I am not telling anyone, I am telling myself. I am guilty of these things to a very large degree and I have admitted it. That is a step. they say it is the hardest step, I disagree. Step two is doing something about it, and I really don't think I am going to do that step anytime soon. I don't even want to think about the consequences of becoming completely honest would be. I lie to maintain my reputation here in indiana, by becoming truthful I will expose all of the lies I have stated while down here and break the trust of all of the friends I have made. I am not the person that these people know. I am not the person that people in LO know. I am me, and I am hidden away from the world because I am afraid. I am afraid of being hurt. I am afraid of being taken advantage of. But most of all I am afraid of being alone."

"event","Love.

I think it is totally misrepresented. Either that or it holds way to much sway in the lives of the people who enjoy it. I have come to distrust and dislike this mythical ""love"". Stories and movies give us an unrealistic idea of what love is suppose to feel like and be about, but in reality love was made up by the forefathers of the hallmarks. 

Love has come to mean abandonment to me. Every time a friend ""falls in love"" I can expect to see him or her a lot less. Plus, it becomes a plausible excuse to ditch someone by saying ""My girlfriend wants to hang out, sorry"" or ""my boyfriend made plans for us tonight, sorry"". What ridiculousness is this? Just because you are making out with someone, or possible screwing someone, that does not make them the most important person in your world. You may think it does because all your horomones are like ""YAY SEX!!!"" but in reality you need to reel in your hormones and get a grip on your life. 

Girls always date jerks, and I always wonder why, but I think I have figured it out, horomones. Girls know they want a nice guy but their horomones say they want sex, and yes I am stating that girls want sex just like guys do, deal with it. So they date the jerks because subconsciously they know a jerk will screw them a lot more and a lot faster than a nice guy who respects them. A jerk has no problem making out with someone because it doesn't mean anythhing to them. it isn't intimate, it is simply the path to be taken in order to get into someone's pants.

Likewise, I always wonder why guys date sluts, and I think it is for the EXACT SAME REASON. they know they are not going to stay with them, they know that they can answer the call of testosterone and screw this girl 3 to 4 days after dating, if that. 

So my question is, in this world that is sooooo caught up in screwing and banging and sex, where is there room for love? all we seek is a physical relationship. Try finding a couple that is in a mentally happy relationship, if they are under 40 you probably cant. 

Oh sure, some girls are all like ""I LOVE HIM SOOOOOO MUCH HE IS SOOOOOO CUTE""............Okay, I don't know if you have SEEN the bumper sticker on facebook, but in case you haven't it says ""blow jobs are like flowers for men"" After living in a dorm and HEARING the way guys talk about girls I have come to believe that guys think of girls as investments. They have an approximate exchange rate of cost of gift to sexual act performed. it is not really that different from a form of prostitution. which is sickening to me. 

Ugh. So back to love, since that was what had me upset in the first place. I always used to laugh when people asked if I believed in love ""OF COURSE I DO"" But I have begun to believe that love, like Santa, is a myth. Something you grow out of as you get older. Sure some people who are older talk about falling back in love with someone , but in reality I think that is the same as discovering a best friend in someone of the opposite sex. And that is all I believe love is or ever will be beyond physical attraction. 

Which brings me back to my start, and now my finish. Love is not a reason to shut out everyone but your lover. On the contrary, you should be making every effort to bring this lover into your life by introducing them to your friends and family. Only by making them a part of your life can you TRULY be significant others. Too many ""couples"" nowadays keep a&nbsp; distance between their friends and their lovers so that ""when"" (notice not an if) they break up it will be easy. If the person you are screwing doesn't mean enough to you for you to introduce them to your friends, then WHY do they mean enough to you to be considered your significant other?

So I posted earlier about how I got something I wished for and never thought I could have, only to find it relatively disappointing. 

However, it did have a positive effect. I have been WAY more confident in everyday life and it has put me into a decently good mood that has stayed for, so far, 2 days. which, while it may not sound like much, is a long time for my mood to be stable. Part of it is still the happy feeling you get when you realize that a wishes can come true, I still cant believe I got this thing, however the confidence that comes with it is a definite plus."

"event","The hunger which persists long after one has eaten his fill is the hunger that we all feel and can only muffle, what is this hunger? how do we feed this hunger? and why do so many things seem to dull the edge of the hunger only to allow it to come back one hundred fold? Some say this is the hunger for love. Others say it is the hunger for god, or something spiritual. I would have to disagree with both, though I am hardly an expert, But I have my own experience. 
 
 The Hunger, as I see it, Is our hunger for companionship. We want people to understand us, because most of us cannot understand ourselves. Unfortunately, in order for other people to understand us we must understand ourselves. If we do not understand ourselves then we are still changing, it is only once we have motivators, goals, ambitions, and dreams that we can be clearly defined. These same things that I have mentioned are also the end of God given free will. 
 
 Hmm, Interesting thought that. (side note, I write stream of consciousness so if I ramble I am sorry)
 
 Perhaps God gives us the free will to choose what we want to be, what we want to do, and what is important to us. once these decisions are made our free will is essentially gone, we simply follow the prescribed path that takes us towards our dreams while being motivated by our ambitions and goals. 
 
This would easily explain the controversy over predestination. If God knows us so well that he knows what decisions we are going to take then he will know that based upon our choices we will be driven to sin to achieve our goals and ambitions. So God does not pre-plan our lives, but he knows where they will take us long before we have even made these choices.

God confuses me so I want to talk about something else.

I like to hold hands with people. It feels like a spiritual connection gets formed when you intertwine your fingers with someone else's and look deep into their eyes. Doesn't matter if it a friend or significant other. 

ugh, significant others..... their is a topic I suppose I will breech. 

I do not have a significant other, nor do I really think I will have one in the near future. I am afraid that I am WAY to logical and practical to have a meaningful relationship. School would always come first, because it is likely to make an impact in my life LONG after a girlfriend is gone. Sex just isnt worth the risk that comes along with it. Honestly, nothing scares me more than the thought of getting a girl pregnant. So I simply dont date or sleep around with random Girls. I suppose there is the additional fear of STD's that keeps my chastity belt on, but that isn't as fearful to me. I suppose religion also keeps me locked away from any sexual attraction.

haha, locked away! I just pictured me taking a much more emotional version of me and locking it in an endless tower that is completely full of fantasy books. I could be happy there.

Happy. Is anyone truly happy? I dont think so. I believe people learn to be content with their lives and so they say they are happy. It just is not true. Settling on an okay option when you know that you can do more is not okay, it doesn't bring happiness. Job security, wages, strippers, prostitutes, alcohol, and drugs do not bring happiness. Everyone needs to find something that makes us happy, sounds easy, but it is not. 

I could keep writing but I wont make this any longer.....

I always wonder why I come back to LJ, and I have to say that it is the best form of self expression that I have available to me. I have to admit that I do read the journal entries that other people post and most of my entries are private in contrast, but it feels like there is a connection between me and all my ""LJ friends"" because I know what is going on in their lives. I know their hopes and fears. I know their favorite color, birthday, and mothers maiden name from random 150 question long tests that we have all taken and posted on our LJ's. However, it has gotten to the point where I have not talked to these people in so long that I cannot place a name with a LJ name. So I read these entries without knowing who is writing them and I love to guess who is writing them. 

Of course, I do know some. Jamie, Jinelle, Kelly, ect... But others I have no idea. 

Anywho, today I turned to LJ because of something random. I was on facebook and someone status was ""I just dont know what to do"". It wasn't someone I talked to a whole lot, actually I mainly interacted with him in a competitive manner in tennis. we didnt go to the same high school, and we dont go to the same college. Anyways, the reason this is important is because I decided to send him a message. I told him ""Whatever you choose to do, go for it with your whole heart and dont look back. The past is in the past and there is nothing you can do about it so dont dwell on your mistakes. Learn your lessons and keep moving forward."" After sending this I got a reply like 2 weeks later where he was profusely thanking me and he said I really helped him make some EXTREMELY important decisions in his life. It took me a few minutes to remember that I had sent him something and then a few more to realize that I just changed someone's life. I didn't do anything big or important, I just reached out a hand to a random someone who was looking for help.

The point is: I helped someone and I felt really good about it."

I pushed that out of my mind as I pressed forward, all I wanted to do was get my frozen feet out of the snow. Being the graceful person I am, I made it into view of my family through the window, and slipped on ice, falling flat on my face. My lip split open and the coppery taste of blood filled my mouth. I was so humiliated. I was lying in the snow with no shoes on and crying. Worst Christmas Eve ever."

"event","So I realized why a lot of guys don't like me. I have put several posts up about how guys are abnormally overprotective about their girlfriends around me, and I didn't understand what was wrong with hugs and friendship with members of the opposite sex. Well, now I know the problem. One of my friends has indulged in me the secret of the subdued anger towards me. Apparently alot of guys think I act gay, just so that I can get closer to their girlfriends and take them off-guard. I personally would like to know how waging a quite open anti gay conservative republican war on gay marriage qualifies me to be ""acting gay"" and ""playing a part"". These people seriously think I act the way I do because I WANT people to think I am gay. there is something seriously messed up with that logic. Seriously messed up.

on another note, My friend that is mad at me still hasn't talked with me. I haven't gotten a whole lot of sleep since they got upset...maybe 12 hours in 6 days? Dont think 2 hours a night either, I slept for 10 hours yesterday because I hadn't slept in five and I basically passed out. And yeah, I was going to writee more of an update on my life, but instead I will be lenient and give out a gold star for reading this short one, no silvers or bronze, just gold for getting this far."

Absolutely anything.

that means alot. Like a whole lot.

Now, if you can picture this person imagine they are upset.

How do you feel?

well you are pretty upset, and you want to make it better.

But you can't

So now not only do you feel bad cause this person is upset but you also feel like you are failing to help them.

"event","So the main idea is that God, our creator who we are eternally indebted to, wants us to live life for a mysterious purpose, resist sin, and eventually die and be judged. <br /><i><br />Did I see a point in there? I think so but it is rather vague<br /></i><br />well maybe not the meaning of life then, maybe we should start with the joy of life it is simpler<br /><br /><i>So....what is the Joy in life?<br /><br /></i>well, it could be a lot of different things..<br /><i><br />So basically it is another mystery<br /><br /></i>No, I think that the joy in life is Love<br /><br /><i>Love? what kind of ""love"" intimate relationship style? friendships? sex? family love? loving your pets? explain.<br /><br /></i>Love in general, all things that involve love, as long as it is acceptable by the Lord.<br /><br /><i>So basically gay love, bestiality, sex out of wedlock, divorced and widowed remarriages.<br /><br /></i>well, maybe not to that extreme...<br /><br /><i>Why would there be different types of love that are and are not allowed?<br /><br /></i>well maybe it isn't ""love"" but Lust that we are dealing with here.<br /><br /><i>So, you are saying that everyone who has gotten divorced isn't allowed to remarry or else it is a marriage of lust?<br /><br /></i>Well, no, but the bible infers that a marriage is for life and that cheating is a sin and after death the wedlock remains.<br /><br /><i>Ok, so we will change subject, are all gays lusters and sinners?<br /><br /></i>It is possible and I think probable based on the text of the bible, but that doesn't mean it is fair or logical.<br /><br /><i>But I thought God was loving kind caring and just, isn't everything he does logical?<br /><br /></i>well, in theory, yes, but it is logical to him and we cannot comprehend his purpose for us<br /><br /><i>So basically what we get back to is why does God allow us to be tempted in the first place?<br /><br /></i>He wants us to have free choice, so that we can choose to be good people or not good people.<br /><br /><i>If he truly loved us and was truly forgiving then why would he care if we screwed up and led a life of sin?<br /><br /></i>The point he wants to get across is that all of us are sinners but we must strive to find and emulate Jesus<br /><br /><i>So, we are trying to achieve perfection when it isn't possible and if we fail, which we will, we are then judged by how close we got?<br /><br /></i>I guess so, it is difficult to say what the cut off line is for the people going to heaven and the people who are not.<br /><br /><i>You mean the people going to hell<br /><br /></i>well, yes.<br /><br /><i>Why is that difficult to say? isn't that the whole point? be good or you are going to hell?<br /><br /></i>Well, the idea is strive to go to heaven, not to fear hell and try to get into heaven.<br /><br /><i>Ok, fine, back to the original topic, the joy of life, how is love the same thing as joy?<br /><br /></i>well, they are definitely tied together, you only feel joy when you are with someone or something you love.<br /><br /><i>So, going off the idea that it isn't lust but unsanctioned love, it is possible to feel joyous about something God doesn't like?<br /><br /></i>well, I suppose that, if unsanctioned love exists, is valid<br /><i><br />So basically, for some people, Life is going to be completely void of all joy , if they follow god, since they have unsanctioned love<br /><br /></i>Here I can say No, God brings Joy with him, and they will have Joy from being filled with the spirit<br /><br /><i>Is the spirit enough to keep a person eternally joyous?<br /><br /></i>Hypothetically speaking, yes<br /><br /><i>But in practice?<br /><br /></i>well, most people also feel the need for the Joys of the flesh, which is allowable in wedlock.<br /><br /><i>So, basically I was right, Gays, widows, and other ""unsanctioned lovers"" cannot follow christ and be joyous.<br /><br /></i>well I suppose they cannot enjoy all of the joys that their sanctioned counterparts enjoy.<br /><br /><i>I thought God was a just God?<br /><br /></i>..........<br /><br /><i>So, now I will go back further to the purpose of life<br /><br /></i>What about it?<br /><br /><i>Is there even a purpose to life? and if so is it universal? and, if yes again, then why do some people die at younger ages?<br /><br /></i>Yes there is a purpose, we are to strive to know and be like Jesus, yes it is universal, but it effects us in different ways.<br /><br /><i>meaning?<br /><br /></i>Meaning that sometimes your purpose is to die in a specific way to motivate others into fulfilling their purpose.<br /><br /><i>So basically they lived just to die.<br /><br /></i>In a manner of speaking, yes, just like Jesus.<br /><br /><i>So how are they judged then? on whether or not they died when they were supposed to? and can they even avoid this fate?<br /><br /></i>Well, I think that they are judged on everything besides their purpose, did they evangelize? did they find Christ? did they attempt to resist sin<br /><br /><i>So we have predetermined lives?<br /><br /></i>Well, we have a predetermined purpose, but everything up to fulfilling that purpose is our own choices.<br /><br /><i>Is it possible to avoid our ""destiny""<br /><br /></i>If it is possible then it just shifts the burden onto someone else<br /><br /><i>Wait, so some people have multiple purposes?<br /><br /></i>well yes<br /><br /><i>Are they added as after they are born?<br /><br /></i>yes....<br /><br /><i>so basically if you try to be faithful and follow God then he burdens you with more tasks to do before you can get in?<br /><br /></i>I suppose so, but they are not burdens, it is a joy to follow God.<br /><br /><i>So you say, but wouldn't it just be easier to live life how you want and ask forgiveness as you are dying just in case?<br /><br /></i>well hypothetically yes, since God is forgiving, asking for forgiveness is key, but somehow I doubt he would be lenient towards sinners.<br /><br /><i>So basically, you either live a life of servitude, doing whatever god asks and begging for forgiveness every time you mess up.<br /><br /></i>I suppose it could be looked at like that<br /><br /><i>Or you live a life how you want to live it and you might get screwed over in the end.<br /><br /></i>if by ""in the end "" you mean eternity. You know Eternity is a long time to be wrong.<br /><br /><i>True, but, going back , if you were to die young doesn't that mean you are judged more harshly since you haven't had time to learn?<br /><br /></i>well, again, yes, hypothetically but..<br /><br /><i>So God allows some people to make a lot of mistakes and learns, and kills off others just to make a point and happens to doom them to hell<br /><br /></i>well, I am sure that it isn't the way it seems.<br /><br /><i>Well, it seems to me that life doesn't have a purpose and, if when you die it is over, then hopefully God will take us quick because then we will have to suffer less, resist less, feel pain less, and altogether have less of everything unpleasant. If God loves us then why does he allow pain? sorrow? loss? as lessons? ok, fine. But why do we fear death then? shouldn't we relish it? look forward to it? or do we all know that we are sinners and that the majority of us are not going to heaven and that the majority of us are following a faith that is WRONG. I am not saying christianity is wrong, but I am saying if it is right there are a WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE who are going to HELL! doesn't that seem a bit odd coming from a kind, caring, just God? So I guess the point of life is to decide whether or not this is all worth it. You are sent to earth just to have your friends, family aquaintances, morals, social stigmas, and lifestyle change and shape who you are. this leads to you making decisions that may doom you to hell. So basically we need to avoid all sin, and try and live in a white box, but even that is sinning through sloth!. So, Life, as we know it, is the attempt to achieve the unattainable perfection found in Jesus Christ, and, on judgement day, our attempts will be weighed against our imperfections, flaws, regrets, and slip ups, and hopefully, HOPEFULLY mind you ,we have no guarentee, God, and Jesus, will allow us into heaven<br /><br />To my readers, I am sorry but my pessimistic side has conquered me tonight. I am fairly down and searching for meaning in the world/life and at the same time trying to understand my own imperfections with more clarity and how to resist and whether to resist the temptations that goad me. You all get and deserve my gold star to the readers that actually finish my posts. And to those who are irritated by my long posts, I am sorry for my ignorance on how to make a cutout of the lengthy material. I thank you all for caring enough to read. I love you all and I hope that God works to make your lives as wonderful and peaceful as possible. God Bless!<br /></i>"

But, it was all worth it because I got my wallet back and it made me really happy, and I can now get food again. it is funny how simple life can become when all you really care about is how you are going to get your next meal. It was kind of eye opening and it helped me realize that a lot of what I think is important really isn't."

Then, while at chem, I realize that I didn't do the prelab for chemistry, which sucked but wasn't bad, so On my way back to my dorm I realize that my wallet is not on my personage, but I had only stepped out of class for 3 minutes or so, so&nbsp; I ran back and it wasn't there. Soooo angry. So now my wallet with all my money and access to food is gone. then I get back to my dorm go to my room and realize that I turned off my computer without saving my lab report, so I have to do a 5 pg lab report, plus a prelab in an hour and a half. NOT FUN! so I arrive at my lab like 5 minutes late, with the completed lab and prelab, and, of course, i am starving cause i havent eaten all day. then I proceed to do the 4 hour lab. UGH!"

"event","So for the past couple days I've started practicing computery drawing.  For the most part I prefer physical mediums, but I have this thing (I am a Virgo after all ~ my perfectionism is pretty much the only Virgo-esque trait I possess so I might as well embrace it) about figuring out things that seem hard.  It's kind of like how that one time I spend an entire summer sewing purses/stuffed-animals for all of my friends, and that other time when I spent way too much of my spare time learning php.  Idk I just like assigning myself projects.

Anyways, ultimately I plan on making a giant Brady-bunch grid drawing of pop stars.  It's kind of ONTD-inspired, an illustration of how these random-ass musicians and performers manage to bring a variety of people together... because you have to admit there is something kind of warm and fuzzy about stan wars.  Without the fights about Rihanna copping MIA's style and Ke$ha bitching about Britney lip-synching and pro-Gaga and anti-Gaga argument, think of how sad and lonely and bored all the stans (and innocent bystanders) would be.

What follows immediately are the first 5 drawings I've done, Gaga, Ke$ha, Britney, Taylor, & Rihanna.

<img src=""http://paperpetual.com/miscimages/bradybunch/rihanna.jpg"" width=""400px"" height=""480px"" />

I also did a Bey drawing but it is too bad to even post so I am keeping that to myself for now.  And considering I'm not too embarrassed to post the Britney drawing, just try to imagine how terrible Bey came out.

Ke$ha is still my favorite... hers is more like a caricature I guess, somehow I guess I'm sort of getting a smidgeon more realistic as I go along.  Whatever, that's practice/experimentation for you.  And frankly, it's nice to be doing something that isn't ever going to be critiqued. 

Of course, there will be more to come ~~~"

"event","<span class=""firstletter"">I</span>'ve worked on a couple murals over the years, usually school related projects involving a number of people and artists. This mural was different, if only because it was all up to me. And boy did that make a difference.

I went into it thinking it would take me about a week if I worked steadily. Ha. In retrospect, that thought is hilarious. To be fair, I hadn't exactly measured the space, and I didn't have a concrete plan of what I was going to paint (albeit something beach themed). The first thing I did after getting to Palm Beach was measure, and as it turns out 30ft x 10ft x 6ft with 10 doors is actually ginormous when it comes to painting. 900 square feet of regular house painting, especially if you have 10 doors worth of trim to attend to, takes forever. Then add in carefully measuring and taping off faux window panes, actually painting the murals, and then finishing everything with faux trim? FOREVER.

But I've finally finished, so here goes:

"event","<span class='firstletter'>I</span>'m down in Florida (Singer Island, West Palm Beach) to paint a mural!  It's a pretty big project, consisting of transforming an entire dismal service hallway into a cheerful beach scene.  It's a big hallway, complete with 10 doors to various things (closets, apartments, utilities, elevator, stairs, etc).

The rough plan is to paint a series of faux windows on each wall, as well as a series of faux window panes on each door; I think this will be the best way to transform the room without trying to hide the doors.  I plan on incorporating birds into the scenery, so I did a little painting prep before I flew down:

I'll probably end up adding a few more small birds in the background in some places, but for the most part these are all the birds!  I painted them on stretched Rives BFK and then carefully tore them out; I'll eventually sand down the edges once I adhere them to the primed (and semi-painted) mural.

I've never used collage in a mural before, but i think this will work out nicely."

and in less than a month i'll be back in the strange oasis that is mercyhurst and erie.  i can't even begin to imagine what that will be like... but i'll find out soon enough i suppose.

i feel like i have so much i need to finish here.
i feel like i have so much to catch up on at home!

all-in-all, i'm thoroughly glad that i did this, went off by myself for awhile, traveled the world (or europe at least), learned how to be self-sufficient.  the other day i was so proud of myself, because i easily navigated bus stations to train stations to bus stations again.  i feel like i couldn't have done that once-upon-a-time.  i guess maybe that's silly, but that's OK.

I'm not religious in the slightest, but even still a wish like that makes me feel... warm.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to believe in anything, but i know i'll always wish i could.  And I'll always be envious of those who can. 

My mom would always say, ""If wishes were nickels then beggers could fly.""  It really doesn't make any sense.  Sometimes I wish i were a musician instead of an artist.  Sometimes I just feel like so much more can be transferred audibly... a tune, vocals, beat, lyrics, meaning, feeling.  There isn't that unspoken voodoo that seems to surround art.  Art gets this rap of being higher-than-thou and pretentious, while music can reach any audience, grown up or child, poor or rich.

Maybe that's why it's been getting harder and harder for me to make certain kinds of art... but now I'm sounding pretentious.   

Break has been unproductive and now I'm feeling bad about it.  I'm trying to make a pact with myself that I'll start it off better tomorrow, but then I remember the New Years Eve festivities (shopping with mom, other potentials) and SVU marathon and I realize that I won't start tomorrow.  And when you tell yourself ""day after tomorrow!"" you secretly know you're being a slacker jerk and nothing will ever come of it.

I haven't seen anybody outside of family yet, since I've been home.  Weird."

i showed my parents and aubrey the talking dogs and cats videos, and the first thing my dad did afterwards was to get a piece of cheese and attempt to get charlie to bark something remarkable.  charlie wouldn't even bark.  he just sat and layed down, looking eager all the while.  poor guy, he didn't even get the cheese.  then all evening my dad just kept half-wrestling with him, saying ""daddy, i love my daddy,"" trying to pursuade him to speak.  oh, to be home.

"event","<span class='firstletter'>y</span>esterday, i went (with my mommy) to see amos lee in towson, baltimore.

i had big expectations.  i mean, i think i could listen to him forever.  but... even still, i was blown away.  

a guy named mutlu opened.  i'd never heard of him before, but as soon as he came on stage in jeans and a baggy sweatshirt and started playing just acoustic guitar, i knew i liked him.  his voice?  beautiful.  and he sang a song inspired by justin timberlake and jay-z that related lovin' to board games.  ""I'll go down your chutes and up your ladders!""  how could i not be impressed?!  he seemed familiar... but maybe that was just the philadelphia in him.  he reminded me of a quincy i once knew.

<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/sporkychan/mutlujou.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

<lj-cut text=""Amos Lee"">
then, finally, amos lee and his band took the stage.  their energy!  personality!  amos lee's voice!  like i said before, i could just marry his voice.  but his face is pretty-pretty as well.  and he used to teach second grade and you can -totally- tell (at one point he ""shhh'ed"" the crowd, and i could just imagine we were all little 9-year-olds sitting on our carpet squares).

his lead guitarist played every instrument.  he would switch from song to song, from guitar to keyboard to trumpet to mandolin!

<a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v305/sporkychan/amosjou.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

it was just... really refreshing.  i mean, at art school especially, one is always exposed to music with great backing ideas, eloquent lyrics, cool, far-out experimentation.  but sometimes i just need someone to get up and sing who has a voice that cannot be compared to.  i just need to close my eyes and let a smooth melody wash over me.  sometimes i just need some jazz-folk.  i can't help it.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""seeing regina spektor live and for free was basically super cool."">
seeing regina spektor live was basically super-cool.  it's sometimes just really reassuring to see that someone with such amazing talents is actually a normal person.  she got up on her little stage, giggled, talked about getting off the 'no coffee' wagon, clapped along to her own songs, etc.  she only played about 4 songs (it was a free shin-dig at soundgarden, a baltimore record store), but it was still retty amazing.    

ah!  her voice is just... breath-taking.

it was weird getting her autograph... i've never approached anyone thusly before, so i felt rather funny.  but she looked at my drawing and grinned, saying, ""ah, beautiful!"" as she signed.
</lj-cut>

october has turned out to be a month of live shows.

<lj-cut text=""The Hold Steady"">
monday i tagged along with aimee wang to see the hold steady at the ottobar.  that was basically amazing also, even though i haven't listened to much of their stuff.  a band called 'sean na na' opened for them, and i must say that they were pretty great.  and fun looking.  there was this keyboarder who had this perpetual sad look on his face.  he would tuck his long-long-long bangs behind his ears and then go back to playing, sprawled over his keyboard.  he only smiled once the entire time they were on.

aimee and i loved him.

hold steady was awesome.  they sounded great, and the way they interacted with the crowd was pretty cool. and the front man moves his hands energetically as he sings.

i'll see amos lee on the 20th with my mom.

october!  you've been good to me."

"event","Today I returned from my second excursion post-mica: New Hampshire/Vermont/Massachusetts/Connecticut/kind-ofRhodeIsland!

So it's a mouth-full, but we really were only gone friday-sunday.

The fields were right outside Dartmouth college, which is right on the border between Vermont and New Hampshire; me, my mom, my father, and Ramona stayed in New Hampshire, while Aubrey and his team stayed in Vermont, so during the extent of the matches we got an okay look at both states.

once we reached the rugby fields we watched the boys troop in to register (my father video taped it, etc., so I guess it was considered exciting).  they looked all studly in their little polo shirts with those badge things sewed on.  I saw tyler and i smiled and waved, and he grinned at me that tyler berrier grin, cocked his head, and asked, ""why are you here, christiane?""
i paused, looking back at him, slightly confused.  ""well, i'm here to support aubrey!"" (i rubbed his belly... aubrey's, that-is)
tyler: ""aubrey moore, christiane moore... i never put the two together!  Wow!""

it's funny... i'd forgotten how much i missed tyler... and andrew steffen, and ryan dill (because the dill boys have always been the nicest there is), and even detwan with his non-stop cocky-jokesterness.  regular high-school boys are fun.  
and i miss curt.

we left them to check into our ""country inn"" and get dinner.  we had thai, although it wasn't as good as the thai at home (of which hopefully i will be able to convince erin to eat with me on tuesday).  we looked around hanover and dartmouth, and finally went back to ""The country inn.""

It was interesting, I guess.  We were stationed in the room entitled ""Moses Eaton,"" but no one explained why it had such an odd name.  We assumed it was because Moses had stayed there after parting the seas, and then sometime aftwards had been eaten.
They just had bad spelling when they wrote it on the door.  Yep.

So fast-forward to the games:  The first was at 9 am on Saturday, so we left at 8am so we wouldn't be late.  We ended up getting there extra-early which equalled a wait.  Which wouldn't have been bad had it not been raining.

So... that turned out to be the norm of the next two days.  Rain!  I guess we should have prepared ourselves for it, what with the weather new england has been having, but it still came as an ugly surprise never-the-less.  It was freezing and muddy and puddly.  Aubrey's team lost their two games on saturday, and me and Ramona (my mom ended up wandering off with one of our umbrellas) sat on the bleachers freezing as it poured.  I was in my bare feet because all i had brought were moccasins, so i
squished about, and tried to keep my feet warm under my skirt, and eventually we left.  i was happy i wasn't the one actually playing rugby, although i must admit i half-wished there were sports at school.  i can't help it; maybe there's a little bit of my dad's sportiness in me, afterall.

That night my parents conned me and Ramona into babysitting (while on vacation! i know!) for sean's two little girls, so we did,
watching them for about four hours (and by watching them i mean watching movies with the elder while the younger was asleep).  i got a couple phone calls (to a phone that is the loudest in the world) and i had to reprimand the rugby team for sliding down the banisters, since sean and carrie weren't there to do it.  it was strange and awkward, but i got aubrey to lay down the law... ie, look out to see if anyone slid down any more banisters.  Finally my mom came to get us, and then we were told the story of how my father and sean spent their evening at the bar next door: singing karaoke!.

Apparently they had gone back and forth singing songs (while nobody else there, in the crowded bar, was singing), and ventually my dad picked up the nickname ""elvis"" (we didn't hear the end of that over the rest of the weekend), and as a finale, their last song had been a heartfelt duet between my dad and the coach of ""I've Got You, Babe.""

how can people be afraid of my dad???  he sang 'i got you, babe' with sean robinson in a crowded bar in vermont.  he wasn't even drunk.  that is not scary!

The next day they played their last game at 9am again, and while this time it wasn't raining, it was still muddy like nobody's business!  At one point we were trying to figure out who the black kid rolling in on the scrum was, when we realized he was really just ryan covered head to toe in mud.  It was really quite funny watching them play, and after their victory (ranked 15th naturally!) my brother (of course) lead the team in throwing themselves on the ground to slide through the mud.
it was good that they won that last game.  it kept them happy.

(note to self: national league?  travelling all over the world?  tutoring?  what?!)

So then we sent Aubrey on his way back to Pennsylvania, and went to Boston!  I have some pictures and maybe i'll put them up shortly. There's not really so much to tell about that side of the trip.  What can you say about boston?  It was fun and
we wandered for a few hours... window shopping and picture-taking and vegetable/fruit-buying.  Avocados, 5 for $1.00.  MMM!

We moved on to Marshland, Mass, driving along the beach and wading in the ocean a little.  There was a rainbow, the kind that goes the whole way across, and it was one of the most beautiful things i've seen in a long time!  We reminded ourselves of Virginia next weekend and tore ourselves away, heading down to Connecticut (through scary Rhode Island!) where we spent the night in a rather shady motel near Mystic.

my grandfather is 82 today.

i feel like i've been home longer and shorter than two weeks all at the same time.

taking aubs to school at 7am tomorrow, and then work.  living arts festival tuesday (hopefull) with thai food accompaniment.

(i wish i were in love!)"

"event","my brother's rugby team has won states and now (now being next friday) they are advancing to nationals in new hampshire!  my family is going along to support him... leaving thursday.  my mom is worried about finances, but i think we'll be o.k.

they have come out with a play-doh scented perfume!  it is called eau de play-dough.

sunday night we got back from new jersey/new york!  i had gone on a little mother's day weekend trippy with my momma and our exchange student ramona, and we were exploring the city a little (and i included new jersey in the description because we were spending the nights with my grandmother's highschool classmate's home in new jersey).  so, we got in friday night, slept, woke up early saturday and wandered, taking some time off to see chicago (which was funny and sing-y and slutty, which are always things i love to see!), eating, looking through the moma (we just missed the munch show which was disappointing, but i saw some things that were nice), and just walking around. 

we left after not so long, letting ramona go off with her sister to spend the night.

me and my mom went out for italian with edie back in new jersey, which was okay.  i was sleepy and exhausted but i managed not to go to sleep, even when edie took forever to eat.  old people eat slowly. we finally left and i stumbled up to bed, finally.  i slept well that night.

we woke up not-so-early, talked to the daughter and son-in-law relatives of edie (they were from PROVIDENCE!), and finally we got off to go see gardens!  it was mother's day and my mother loves gardens, and it was really good because gardens are really good.  and we went to the cloisters (this weird pseudo-medieval castle that was built in the 1900s via the
met to display medieval art), which was basically christiane art heaven because she got to oggle over an entire castle filled with
religious artwork.  not to mention UNICORN TAPESTRIES. 

(i should take this time to proclaim my love for unicorns.  and janet believed they still existed!  that's what makes me love her so much, that right there.)

i drove home... it was the least i could do for my mom, and driving's not so bad, especially when paired with good music.  it was a little hectic driving in new york city, trying to pick up ramona.  we had told her we'd meet her at the met, and so i not only had to drive through east/west side (including through central park), i had to left my mom out at the met, stall for awhile, dodging taxis, while keeping my place on 5th avenue.  it was a success, though, although stressful.  

the drive home was relaxing; we finally got home around 6, after which we headed to grandma's for mother's day supper.  sometimes that hurts, but it was ok.  my grandmother was delighted, which is good... we need to keep her happy.  she has a tough enough time dealing with my grandfather, and their half-niece-in-law just died, which is strange.  she was young, but it didn't matter.  cancer is tough.
it's strange to think about, though... not her death, but the time when i will be ancient are crickity and i'm just watching as my family and friends begin to die.  i hope i am strong enough by then, and i hope i am not the last to go.

today i had work, and i ate a donut.  i watched rent and thought of janet serenading me and me straddling sways and franz laying his legs over mine.  

i watched grey's anatomy with sways kind-of and it was INTENSE.  and heartbreaking.  i'm glad real life is not as terrifying as television, but at the same time, maybe some people's lives are like that.  and maybe i'm not really living enough.

this past week has been strange.  it seemed like it flew by so quickly; i constantly caught myself, inquiring silently how i would do everything i want to do this summer.  but only a week has gone past.  i have not wasted so much time.  why do i feel like i have?

i need to retrieve my comforter out of my trunk.  last night was so very cold, and i don't want a repeat.

i miss warm bodies pressed against me; i miss sleep-snuggles."

i am tired; my feet hurt.

i am making something pretty, and it makes me feel good because making something pretty always makes me feel good.

tonight the packing will commence!

and then... then i will sleep.  and tomorrow i will get more job applications so i can save up spending money for next year and for a hatchback and for a plane ticket and for some other stuff but i don't know about that stuff yet.  and i need to buy wood chips for sakura and maybe some blank cds.

all after work, that is.

"event","today was ashlee's birthday.

i worked for most of it.  it was the first day back with rolling sandwiches and helping customers and wishing the music played louder.  i played the mix sways gave me and kelsey's mix one after another, and things seemed to pass more quickly.  i cleaned and made mistakes, but things were ok.  the people there were ok.  

the girl i worked with is new; she knew me but i don't really remember her... i wish i could remember everyone.  i wish my memory was better.

afterwards i went with ashlee to babysit and then we got coffee.
at the crimson frog there was a gathering, and we sat down for a minute to watch the poets.
ashlee writes better than they did; kelsey writes more beautifully in her journal entries alone.  maybe i'm just biased to diction penned by those i love, but there was just an emotion those poets lacked, a connection to their words.
they tried to make their tongues spit eloquently, and then the syllables lost their meaning.
and then there was the balding man who spoke in the point of view of a young girl being abused by her family.  i'm not sure i need to go into further detail about him.  i think that is self-explanitory.

we left after not-so-long.  we went home, and we laughed with aubrey and then chatted with my mom and then smoked some cigarettes (and by smoked some cigarettes i mean she smoked and i smiled and sat beside her.  i like sitting beside her while she smokes.)

and then i took her home and i read some of her poetry and we talked about jara and politics and people.

i cannot imagine a time without ashlee.  
i cannot imagine a time when we couldn't laugh together so relaxed.
i think our friendship will always be the same; i leave for weeks, for months, and then:
i come back and things are the same, and not the same in that way where i wish it were different, where i wish she had changed or i had grown.
we are a good team, i think.

i have songs stuck in my head, songs that make me remember dark houses with only one light left on.

everything is beautiful."

"event","so this will be my first non-friend's-only journal.  because i guess this means i have nothing to hide or something?  or just that i'm not embarrased.  or... right, something.  i guess it's for me and for those who are far away but still interested.  i like them.

i think i'll try to write regularly.  or at least more-so than usual.

it'll be in pastel hues; i think that will make things easier."

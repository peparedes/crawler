"event","Very few people really know me even less understand me. But someone I was once really close to would tell me to ""practice my friend making skills"" every time I went to work a few years back.  And it kinda helped.  I am shy and it's hard for me to put myself out there and have people tell me I'm not worth their time (and it has happened to me, which makes it even harder to do it sometimes) but this whole week and me being so nervous with starting at a new place and hoping beyond hope that I'll be as happy here as I was in Flagstaff, has that little piece of humorous encouragement replaying over and over in my head as I try to meet new people and my new coworkers and try and find a place I belong. I do like my job, I just hope beyond hope that I make friends here too.  So, I continue to ""practice my friend making skills"" and try to come out of my shell a little and make at least a good impression as a worker, and hopefully make friends eventually."

"event","Well some interesting stuff has developed lately...and I'm not quite sure how I feel about any of it, or what I'm going to do exactly.  Basically, heat is in my future...maybe 2 months, maybe 8 I don't know but it is going to be interesting for sure to see what happens. 
I've been trying to reconnect with some people from my past lately.  We haven't kept in the best contact, but we've always been there for each other and I kinda need that right now.  Contact with someone.

My parents are coming up for the 12 (exaggeration) weekend in a row, it's actually only been like 6, but this is the last one because the trailer is closed, but they're coming up for Homecoming with some other parents of students that we know and we're going to party hardy (lol) we're going to tailgate and have a lot of fun I know.  I'm kinda excited to see everyone and have fun like it should be. 

I know I'm going to be in the minority in this, but I seriously think that tequila sunrise is a bad idea.  Not necessarily the fact that the bars are going to open so early, but the fact that people aren't just going to get up early to drink.  From most people I've heard that are excited to partake this year the plan is to start drinking Friday night, drink all night, and go to the bars without sleeping at all at 6am, then passing out for a little while and getting up in time to tailgate before the game.  To me that sounds stupid and dangerous and not really that fun.

I'm not partaking this year because for one my parents will be coming up early Saturday and for two I have a 9am meeting at the RL--ohhh fun!  And I think it's stupid, I'd rather sleep at 6am than drink.  But I do plan on having fun at the tailgate and most likely later that night when the parents have gone back to Munds Park, or we've come home from Munds whatever happens. 

So, I'm kinda rambling at this point and I really should do something a little more productive, we'll see what happens..."

All I can ever hope for me or anyone else I know is that they are able to have such a life with another person.  I am and forever will be inspired by the relationship of my parents."

"event","It's weird that I'm actually updating because if I've been online the past 4 months it's been briefly and pretty much to just check my email, so to actually have access to a computer with time to spare, is foreign to me at the moment. 
So, lets do a quick like update...
This summer was a good summer, a lot of stuff happened, most of which I don't feel like getting into currently, that has helped me to define me and figure out my future plans.  But I had fun, went a little wild, made some money, spent a lot of freaking money, drank a lot, worked a lot...and saw some of the people I care the most about.  
School's started and I'm enjoying the semester, light class, extra work, and some fun in the midst of things.  I've been hit on like crazy for some reason by some interesting people.  And if nothing else it's helped boost my confidence.  
Some people are upset at me for standing up for myself and being honest about how I feel.  I can handle that.  I'm tired of hiding who I am and my feelings all to make others feel okay and me feel like crap.  Those aren't real friends if I have to watch everything I do in order to not make a scene.  
I do admit that I've made some mistakes recently...in confrontation, only in regards to one person, in not talking to people, that numbers far greater.  But I honestly feel that because of my confrontation with one, everyone is upset with me, and I don't feel like I have to explain anything to anyone because it was only between 2 me and the other.  

Anyways...I don't even want to think about that
I'm currently in Phoenix, because on Tuesday my parents celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary!  That's a long time for sure by today's standards, and they don't know it but in about 6 hours just about everyone they know is going to be arriving for a surprise party.  This has been so much work and planning and secret keeping.  I'm so ready for it to happen already!!  It's been so nerve-racking and I've spent countless hours on the phone calling people and planning and arranging and making my brother do stuff for me.  <b>I can't wait!</b>

Well, the 'rent's should be leaving soon and so I believe I'll jump into the shower so that ray and I can start shopping real quick :)  <b>I'm soo excited!!</b>

Maybe I'll get around to being online more often, but no promises :)
I hope you all are well, and I hope to talk to some of you soon!"

Most everything is packed and stuff, it's just the little things and last minute things.  Basically it's all getting thrown into one big box at this point because that and bags is all I really have left.  Then tomorrow and Sunday and Monday I get to clean, well clean until I'm done cleaning, and officially move out and stuff, yeah :)

Blah blah blah...my knee is wrecked again, hopefully me keeping the brace on it pretty much all day will help it to not hurt so much, either that or I'm going to have fun wrapping it until it does feel better.

"event","Last night was so fun...the past week or so has been though, fun and crazy and busy, with not enough sleep, and too much caffeine :)

He said we'd talk later, I hope we do, but it at least has me feeling better.  I'm kinda impressed, or I will be if we actually talk.  That'd mean he's trying not to run away from confrontation anymore.  We'll see...But it makes me feel better either way. 

But last night even after the party was intense but fun.  And we'll leave it at that.  

I'm still and probably will forever remain the eternal good girl who hasn't done anything.  I think it's funny when people try to peer pressure me into things.  Dude!  If I haven't succumbed to peer pressure in the last 21 years, why would I start now?  I've made decisions in my life, things that I believe, and I refuse to be a hypocrite to myself...not because of what anyone else thinks but because I have to live with the decisions I make.  Once again peer pressure doesn't work, and if I believe something I'm not going to go against that.  So, I'll forever be the good girl who's done nothing and seen a lot.  Whatever...

I guess I'm done rambling, I need to get ready to move furniture into storage for Angela and Patrick...if anyone wants to help, come on over ;)"

"event","So, this morning, I went to the new apartment with Wendy, looked at it, decided to take it, filled out applications and figured out what I was doing for the next 13 months.  They were running a special or something like that and signing for 13 months the deposit is cut in half and first month rent is free! How sweet is that?!
Then I went to the Newman Center and finished the banner for Pentecost, made some flyers, cleaned up the blue dell's desktop, did some other stuff...I don't remember right now.  I ordered shoes for my new job :)
Then Jordan arrived and we chatted, I finished up some stuff, then we went and saw her cousin's husband's sister in the track meet at NAU it was some big finals thing, montana, eastern washington, portland...some other schools were competing and stuff, it was kinda cool, plus there was a really cute little boy in the group next to us who kept running around and jumping and trying to be a long jumper, it was so adorable!
Then we went to dinner (yummy!) and Kate McCarthy and her date Brian came and joined us for a little bit and we talked and caught up and had a great time.
Then we went to the bars for a little bit, but we didn't really know anyone there and they weren't playing good music, so we ended up at Colin's Pub, played a game of pool and got hit on by this old guy who didn't speak English.  I've come to realize that the only guys who ever hit on me are either considerably older or considerably younger than me and don't speak English.  So, if I'm ever going to find someone I better enroll in a Spanish class. Whatever.  
Then we left and went to Walmart and Jack in the Box.
Then made a graduation gift for a friend and now I'm exhausted and tomorrow is another long day (or today I guess)

Jordan graduates at 10, there's a reception BBQ thing afterwards, then I'm going to try to get down to Prescott before Dan leaves and see him and Jes for her graduation.

Sunday Pentecost service is at 11am in THE DOME ;P I have to be there at 9:30 to get stuff ready and then I get to help clean up afterwards, and there's a potluck at Pius afterwards and then I told Michael I'd work at the Newman Center on Sunday too.  

So basically it's a long and fully and hopefully fun weekend :)  Then Monday starts my new job!!

Yeah, well, it's 2:30am and I'm so tired and I have to be up for graduation soon, so goodnight all I hope you're doing good!!"

"event","Seriously...I've had like the greatest week, not only have the past few weeks been relatively stress free with me getting my papers done and knowing final's would be pretty easy, making me happier than I have been in a long time.  On Monday, I talked to Wendy and we decided to live together, taking the living situation for the summer and next year totally off of the to do list, plus it's Wendy, so that's going to be fun anyways! Then I finished finals today, and I was offically hired at Red Lobster today too...I go in tomorrow to fill all the paperwork out and stuff.  So, it's exciting and everything is coming together, and I'm still in a fabulous mood which is so good because I've missed that. As I'm sure those around me have too. 
So, tomorrow, I fill out paper work for my new job :) work at Michael's, do truck, get utterly exhausted, then go and hang out with my friends and have fun!!  Sounds like an almost perfect day (it'd be perfect without the getting exhausted from truck part, but ohh well).  

Life is good, my parents may come up this weekend, if not, I'm going home Wednesday because Ray graduates on Thursday!! Insane isn't it!  

Smiles all around for everyone!  Nothing could make me happier at this point, or bring me down I believe and if I believe it, it is true (or something like that ;P)

I'm bored...catch you on the flip side 

(ohh yeah!! another fun thing, dan totally fixed my computer and it's fast now, not slow and dumb, it's great!! He's the bestest!)

Night!!"

<P>All in all it was a good weekend for me.&nbsp; I relaxed, worked, saw my family, had fun, went to Church...nothing out of the ordinary, but good none the less.&nbsp; (I was in a really good mood at Church, I kinda scared a few people haha, they're not used to seeing me happy or something like that)</P>
<P>I'm really excited about this Bread for the World letter writing campaign.&nbsp; I hope people participate and we get a lot of letters so that we can hopefully convince congress to keep their promises and help to end hunger in the United States and then the world.&nbsp; Social Justice stuff really gets me happy and hopeful.&nbsp; A few people seemed really interested, and for those of you who may be interested but don't come to the Newman Center, we still need your help, just ask and I'll tell you all about it, in fact I may just post something tomorrow anyways.&nbsp; But help, it's worth it and so simple...a letter, and I have sample letters so it doesn't take much thought or time. If you're not going to stand up and try to make the world a better place, who are you expecting to? (I guess I'll jump off my soapbox now)</P>
<P>Anyway...I'm thinking of doing dinner around 6:30 on Friday.&nbsp; I hope this works for most of you, and I think it will.&nbsp; But let me know if it does or doesn't and we'll try to find a better time for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>But yeah, bed time :)&nbsp; Have a good night everyone, and a good reading week!&nbsp; This is the last week before finals, I'm ready to be done for sure!</P>

My family was in town today :)  Ray came up early with a friend and he bought me lunch, and then I had dinner with them and my parents..yeah!  Tomorrow I get to drive down to Munds Park for lunch and my dad's going to make me food...I love it when the parents/family comes to visit :)

We're writing letters for Bread for the World...I'm excited for that, I hope it goes well, and I hope people write letters...if you're curious, ask me and I'll tell you more and you can write a letter for me too :)

That's it for now I guess, I'm in the middle of laundry and cleaning.  
Today's Gabriela's 22 birthday...I've been invited to join her and her friends at 10 at Margarita Cantina...I may or may not show up, I'm not sure how I'll feel, that's still 2 hours away, we'll see. 

Last night Traci met me at the Newman Center and we watched Blade 1 & 2, she didn't enjoy them as much as I do, but that's to be expected I guess.  I really am strange in my movie liking if you think about it, really.

There's some not so happy stuff on my mind, but I choose now to not think or dwell or even mention them, too much is going right currently, that it's not worth it.  It doesn't have to do with anyone other than me so yeah, I choose to leave that part out.  

Have a good night everybody!  If you're bored, call me I'll be cleaning at home :)
Love ya!"

I feel fine for the most part except for this freaking persistant cough.  And coughing makes my throat hurt and my head hurt...so I guess I don't feel fine...but yeah, anyways. 

And my neck is starting to peel, YUCK!

I miss my friends and my life...I've been doing school and trying to get better since my insane weekend ended, school's there, getting done, but I feel exactly the same health wise. If I don't continually drink something my voice starts to get raspy and leave.  I've had so much water and tea it's insane! I bought 20 packs of tea on Saturday night I believe, half of them are gone :) And I've drank enough water to fill a small pool. But because I sound and feel like crap, I've been given leave from the Newman Center to take care of myself and feel better. I know it's been helping to really relax at home and take care of myself because I'd probably be REALLY miserable if I hadn't but I wish I'd just get better already. 

That's my update because I haven't seen anyone :(  Maybe I'll venture out tonight or something.

Tomorrow: Lunch with Fr. Chauncey at the Union Eatery at noon
Work at Michael's @ 2pm...ohh exciting"

"event","So, today, was another day I guess.  

I'm starting to get sick I can feel it, I have a headache and my throats starting to get rough and stuff. But other than that it was a good day. 

I had class, came home to shower and eat, ended up eating and falling asleep for like 5 hours, woke up, cleaned up a little, went to the Newman Center for EXALT, which was really good actually.  There were a lot of people there and I knew most of them which was awesome.  The music was great and Fr. Billy gave a great teaching on the 7 gifts of the Holy Spirit. I always kinda knew what they were, but it makes so much more sense now. He used a mountain as a visual and it kept reminding me of the book Hinds Feet on High Places which was cool, because that's like one of my favorite books!  But it was just all so much more clear, which was awesome! I also got to see my confirmanii and other teens I haven't seen in a while and my peers too, I love knowing people :)

After EXALT I hurried my butt over to Wilson because I was late, I was supposed to be there at 8:30, EXALT wasn't even over until 8:45...ohh well, I made it in time to eat and socialize with my friends.  We had a great time, we always do though, so yeah, it was great.  After pizza we went to Barnes and Noble for dessert (with 2 s's :P) because Beale was working and couldn't join us for pizza, so we got stuff 1/2 off, sweet (!!) and laughed our butts off and continued our good time. We found this book about ""REAL NINJAS"" and we were reading from that.  And Aub's and I decided that if one of the requirements in the book was that you had a penis, we'd be ninja's according to the rest of the requirements, except for the ultimate test, keep those frozen baby carrots away from us!! :)  We also got kicked out of Barnes and Noble because we were there past close...oops, ohh well.  I don't think they would've said anything if there weren't five of us making a lot of noise, but we were and it was time to go.  

So, now I'm home again, about to start reading probably, listening to my ceiling leak as it hits the bowl I put under it because the pitcher wasn't wide enough because there's 2 leaks now, I really need to get down to the office and report it because it's getting annoying and I can't get to the bathroom without getting dripped on...blah!

I've been updating a lot lately, some of it is relevent to my life, on a personal like level (well mostly my day and fun stuff that happened, which I've been missing), other is stuff relating to the pope mostly.  I'm really excited about this new pope, I'ma little leary of some stuff I've heard, but at the same time, we have to give him a chance to actually be pope before anyone passes judgement.  He was obviously the man that's supposed to be Pope otherwise he wouldn't be...100+ men of the cloth thought he was being called to lead us.  We have to trust that God had a hand in that decision, and I believe He did, and I intend to trust that He knows what He's doing, and that it's right for the world :)  Now I'm done with that.  I'm excited to see what happens, this has got to be an insane time for him (B4squared) and I hope he has the energy to keep up especially these first few weeks (he is 78 for goodness sake).  Just say a little prayer for the pope.

Ohh yeah, and say a little prayer for Jason and Sarah Kidd too...I didn't actually hear if the test went the way they want it to, but hopefully it does because they want it and they deserve it, and it would be so exciting I think! (If you're curious ask me, but I'm not going to post it all over the internet, because it's not my news and I don't have all the information).

Anyways, I'm off to either read or shower, I haven't quite decided, both will happen tonight it's just the order that's in question at the moment.  Call me if you want, I'll be up, not only did I take a nap (unintentionally) I had chai tea (which has caffine) so I'll be up for a while.  

I hope you're all well, and I'll talk to you soon, if I haven't already :)"

"event","We are called to be, ""true adults in the faith.  Being an adult means having a faith which does not follow the waves of today's fashions or the latest novelties. A faith which is deeply rooted in friendship with Christ is adult and mature""
-Pope Benedict XVI

Another informative website about the new pope
http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/19/ratzinger.profile/index.html


Last night while at dinner with Jason, Sarah, Katie, Henry & Colleen, Katie was talking to a friend, Matt Scott, who congratulated her on our new pope, but had one disappointment, his new name...he complained that Benedict XVI was a lame name...so intead he would call him B-16...no he would call Benedict XVI - B four squared...lol. So watch, the next t-shirt or flyer Jason makes with Benedict XVI on it will say B4squared..lol.

After dinner I went to Charly's and hung out with Gabriela and her friends and listend to a bunch of people play open mic...Charly's is pretty chill Tuesday nights...a pretty artsy crowd thought I guess.  Gabriela didn't play until midnight, so we were all exhausted by then, but we kept ourselves entertained I guess. Gabriela and her friend Nate picked each others noses.  Gabriela's other friend Shannon, lifted the pant leg of a guy walking by to check and see if he was really wearing black socks with tennis shoes.  They all drank, we listened to good music, and some weird music...what did they call it, not music, it was impressionistic art or something like that, it was weird let me tell you that. Then Gabriela played and it was great and we left shortly there after, Meat Wallet was playing as we were leaving (that's Gabriela's roommate and other friends) but it was late and we were tired.  

So, all in all, yesterday was a great day :)

What does today hold?  I'm not sure, but we might get together for pizza after EXALT.  Let me know if that's changed at all by the way...

Ohh yeah, if anyone orders pizza today, make sure it's from Pappa John's and mention Best Buddies and they get some percentage (20%)of all the pizza order or something like that.  I suck at remembering...so that might be what needs to be done, I know it's Pappa Johns and I know it's Best Buddies...that's all I guess :)

Anyways, have a great day y'all and I hope to see/talk to you all sometime soon."

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Tonight was really great actually, especially seeing how I went to the Newman Center.&nbsp; That place is a looming omen of doom to me most of the time and it was when I got there today, but I got a free dinner, and the speakers were amazing, they really rejuvinated my soul I guess.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>My goal in life is to be a Social Worker, to be involved in social justice and serve others and the community.&nbsp; My goal at the Newman Center is the same thing. However, being the intern with the stresses and responsibilities and frustrations, I haven't had ANY opportunity to really go after that.&nbsp; And in school it's always learning and writing and learning, not doing...I'm just burnt out in my life it seems, as my previous entry obviously conveyed. And to see people living the way I want to when I'm done here, just gives me so much hope that there is an end to my current frustrations and even though I have no time right now in four weeks, I am free to start doing real service and real soul searching and real spiritual diving for myself.&nbsp; It gives me the needed strength to make it through the next four weeks so that I can do what I'm longing to do.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I told everyone basically that I'm not going to be an officer for the Newman Club next year, but I am willing to take on service...I'm willing to make sure that the Newman Center offers opportunities to help our community as much as possible.&nbsp; This is what I want to do, this is part of what I'm supposed to do, and by only answering to me and not Colleen and Michael I'll have more motivation and more freedom to work when and how I want.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I'm finally seeing the good things about the future...well about the end of the semester at least.&nbsp; That's not right...I'm finally able to find joy in just the knowledge that in 4 weeks I'm done, where as last night and the past few days I've just been frustrated and stressed and unable to see anything past my frustrations and stesses. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I really like the JP kid from the Newman Center, he's so sweet and he may run for an office, I hope he does...we need new and faithful people at the Newman Center that aren't just there because they lack the social skills to have friends elsewhere. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I've had a few conversations with friends where they've told me that the end of this semester has left them too questioning who they really are.&nbsp; If it's that they've put so many masks on they can't find who they are underneath or they feel out of place in their major, or location, or job, or something.&nbsp; And I totally understand, not just sympathize or empathize, but I've been through it, I'm still going through it.&nbsp; And half the time I don't know what to say or if I even have any words of comfort to give because I'm not comfortable period. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I've gotten rid of a lot of my masks I know I have, but I still hide so much from everyone.&nbsp; And it's only when something bothers me incecently that anyone even notices that there's something off with me, and even if they notice, they have no clue what it's about. Sometimes when I name that mask, so to speak, and I figure out what it is that caused me to put it on or what causes me to keep it or what it does for my life, it's not easy to toss it.&nbsp; I don't like what's underneath, it's vulnerable, it's something I want to hide obviously otherwise why would I have put the mask on in the first place.&nbsp; But then I remind myself that unless I know who I really am I'm never going to be really happy, I'm never going to be able to truly give myself to anyone in service or love.&nbsp; Often I don't even recognize what I find underneath, and often I just shove it back inside, but I'm trying.&nbsp; I really do think that this summer is going to be a huge discovery for me.&nbsp; I'm going to discover myself and Flagstaff and life I guess...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>I do know that I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff, and I do know that I'm supposed to be a Social Worker and I do know I'm supposed to do something at the Newman Center before I leave Flag...so that stuff for me is figured out for me now I guess...it's just the other stuff. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Anyways, we have officer elections and a BBQ at the Newman Center on Thursday, I'll be there and I'll get a free dinner again which I don't mind.&nbsp; I kinda really want to get people's thoughts and opinions though.&nbsp; I want to know what they want from the Newman Center, what activities, what level of deepness in spirituality (what activities relating to that)...what will bring people in and give them what they're seeking?&nbsp; I really want to do a lot of service projects, I also want to really get back to my faith.&nbsp; I feel so out of it.&nbsp; Like a weekly rosary or chaplet of divine mercy or bible study or faith sharing, or a combination of it all...If you have any thoughts let me know PLEASE, I'll beg if you want.&nbsp; <STRONG>Even if you're not Catholic, what in your faith life&nbsp;works?</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Well, this ended up being a lot longer than intended, if you made it through this congrats and I appologize for my rants and long-windedness ;P&nbsp; But I do believe I'm off to bed or something...we'll see what happens.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Goodnight everyone, good luck with the rest of your week (and semester) I hope you find time to relax and not stress, basically take a break...take a break for me if not for you :)&nbsp; Anyway, y'all take care now ya hear, and call me if you need anything...I don't mind I promise!</FONT></P>

"event","<P>So, I worked at the Newman Center tonight for three hours and when I came out I had a flyer on my car...which says: </P>
<P><STRONG>ARE YOU PERFECT YET?<BR></STRONG><STRONG>PERFECT IN CHRIST?<BR></STRONG><STRONG>WHY CONTINUE TO DISOBEY JESUS?</STRONG></P>
<P>Then a bunch of bible passages which I don't want to type out...but if you want to look them up they are</P>
<P>Matt 5:48<BR>1Peter 1:15-16<BR>Acts 2:38<BR>Romans 6:3-4<BR>Gal 2:20<BR>Gal 3:27<BR>Gal 5:24-25</P>
<P>Then it says: </P>
<P>Those who disobey God, go to hell. <BR>Why lose eternity in paradise for a few moments of sin?<BR>Call and we'll talk. 480-984-4496<BR>If I'm not in, leave a message.&nbsp; </P>
<P>If this is something that someone really feels called to do, good for them...but I guess I'm just wondering, why they put these on the cars at the Newman Center. There couldn't've been more than 4 cars in the parking lot which were owned by me, the two that live there, and either the director or Brandon.&nbsp; So, they're either anti-Catholic or just plain dumb...do I want to talk to this person?&nbsp; A little, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.&nbsp; But if you'd like feel free :)</P>
<P><BR>In other news, lol, Brandon gave me a mini massage, so my back feels a litle better, but it does still hurt. Especially if I try to use my right side at all...kinda sucks seeing how I'm a righty...I guess that's what I get for falling down the stairs. </P>
<P>If anyone would like to give me a massage, a real hard one (you'll see me grimace, but in a good way) I'd so appreciate it!&nbsp; Just let me know and I'll come to you :)</P>
<P>I've been updating a lot lately, I guess I've had a lot to say, sorry if I bore you...lol...</P>

"event","So, last night I walked for probably a good 4 hours...I'm feeling good today.  However next time I'll definitely be wearing my knee brace.  I don't know haven't you ever just felt like getting out and walking?  I do, quite frequenlty, I usually don't just because like everyone last night got worried, it's not always that safe, but since I hurt my back I could either lie down flat or stand and I had way too much energy to be still.  I wasn't worried about my safety just so you all know, however everyone else was...I guess I appreciate it. But sometimes it makes me feel like nobody trusts me to take care of myself.  But I definitely got answers last night.  Nothing surprising, but it was about time for me, that I actually heart the answers.  It was one of those things.  I knew what God had told me, but I wanted it to not be true.  But it was, He's always right.  

On a different note: 
I've been ruminating the past few days on what Fr. Chauncey said on Sunday. Doubt is a choice, it's a choice to not believe in anything beyond yourself or your experiences.  Doubt is telling God that He either doesn't exist or that He has to prove Himself to us, individually.  Faith it taking others accounts of events and finding the truth in it...knowing and believing there's something beyond us and our experiences.  
However, God does show Himself to us, in little, sometime easy to over look ways every day.  It's up to us to pay attention and figure out the messages that He sends us. 

So, the right side of my back still hurts, including my arm.  It's kinda hard to move.  But it'll be okay I'm sure.  It doesn't hurt as bad as it did yesterday thats for sure.  But I think I need to stretch it out and just really relax.  If I still can't move well, I may just resign myself to asking someone for a massage. We'll see though...

Well that's it for now I guess...I hope you all have a good day, talk to you later :)"

"event","So, other than my blurb on how bad I hurt...I havent' really updated.  

Last week was well...interesting to say the least.  I did a lot of soul searching and self-esteem finding and well, God finding.  I definitely found some answers, some hurt, some were healing...but I definitely feel more back to normal.  

I worked a lot, that kinda sucked, but good because that means I get money.

Saturday I had dinner at my apartment, we had burrito's.  Aubs, Beale, AJ, Erin, Seth, Dan, Steph, Brandon, and myself ate good.  Then about half of us plus some who didn't do dinner, all went and saw Sin City.  Good movie, but graphic...be forwarned, and know that it's GRAPHIC! I had to cover my eyes a few times and it almost made me throw up...but it was a good movie.

After the movie I took AJ home and we had a really really good long talk.  I love that kid, he's so fabulous!  I love all my friends in fact and Saturday was a good night and I'm glad we were able to do it.

But I still hurt, and have yet to make my way to medicine...I guess I better...why am I such the klutz all the time, always falling, running into things, hurting myself...physicallly and emotionally, and letting others down at the same time and hurting them...I'm sorry...

I'm sorry..."

On top of that I did some really stupid stuff to very possibly ruin another good friendship.  I wish I weren't so dumb sometimes, but I am, and I suck, and I'm really sorry!

I spent 2 hours with Aubs tonight, and we chatted and looked through pointless magazines and drank chai tea :) but we chatted about basically nothing.  It was great.  It's one of those things, we could be sleeping, or watching tv...it's just better knowing that she's there, close by, just in case, just for comfort, just for idle, pointless, relaxation and calm time.  
I love my Aubrei!!  And I know I feel better just for spending time in her glorious presence :P

Tomorrow: Work, dinner with friends, then SIN CITY!! (the movie, not Vegas, not meaning we're going to do much that could be questionable...hehehe!)  I can't wait until after work :)"

I was supposed to work from 4-9ish...but they let me go at 7 because we were slow and I asked, so I got to catch the Seder Meal...mmm...free food...GOOD food!! And I got to see my Aubrei for a little longer than I thought that I would be able to which was great, because I love talking to my Aubrei!  And then we went to the bars, we hit Colin's pub for a while, then we went to San Felipe's for a while and called it a pretty early night for most people that went out.  Then Mark and I watched Boondock Saints it was great!  I love that movie!  So, it was a great day!!  I danced with Aubs at SF and I ran into Stiner again which was so fun, he kinda gropped both me and Aubs..but he was so super drunk, I think I may call him and do lunch some time or something, or we'll catch one of his parties...something like that.  

Hmm...it's officially spring break now I guess.  I worked today and I work tomorrow.  We're all supposed to get together tomorrow night, but I'm supposed to take James to the airport too...so I may have to miss the festivities of tomorrow night unless we start semi-early.  

Hopefully it's a relaxing break.  I don't work as much as I would've hoped, but hopefully, cameron and shawn still come up, and hopefully I'll get to see Jon Goble when I finally get down to phx.  And hopefully I'll get an Aubrei size massage at some point too :)

Random fact...colin firth plays darcy in brigette jone's diary...he also plays darcy in pride and prejudice...fabulous!!

I'm hungry!!  
I love Law & Order!!
I remembered before I ate that I couldn't eat meat today...I'm proud, I usually forget.  

Hmm...I think that's it for now...I hope you have a great weekend and a fabulously restful spring break! :)"

"event","this has been an amazing week and I can't remember the last time I was this happy...that makes me even happier :)

I just wanted to recap a few fun things that have gone on this week...
Aubrei turned 21 on Friday, that was amazingly fun, yet....interesting, I don't want to keep bringing it up, but I did have a great time. 
Sunday I ended up going to Lifeteen mass and then staying for the life night...I haven't been there in so long, it was great to see the teens and be a part of it yet not have any pressure or responsibility. It was great, even if I did get yelled at twice on Sunday for not being able to help someone, well two people.  ohh well
Then on Monday it was a SNOW DAY!  So, the five of us got together (the 5 being me, aubs, beale, mark, and aj) we ate chinese food and watched 1776 the musical, the boys played that pool game thomas introduced to the newman center and it was a great time, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  One of the best parts for me though, I was fought over, literally fought over, I think I may have gotten caught in the crossfire once or twice too.  Mark and Aubs are fabulous!  After the fighting they divided me up, Aubs got 55% and Mark got 45%, so while I feel special because I was fought over for the first time, I feel strangly abused :)
Then today, I went and got breakfast at burto's or however you spell it and I totally got hit on by the cook guy. This is the second time that I can remember especially recently that I've been hit on by someone from Mexico, last time it was a 19 year old in LA this time it was the cook, who looked older than 19 at least.  Maybe I should just learn Spanish since that's the language of those who hit on me ;) haha!

Then on Thursday we're all hanging out again and going to colin's pub for st. patty's! It's going to be so much fun being Irish for a night!!

So, life is good...the end :)"

How vague and random is this?

On a seperate note...Aubrei's power hour is tomorrow night...we're going to look hot, Aubrei will be the hottest of course and we're going to have a blast!!  I can't wait!

I've decided to go to Pius for mass tonight to see the teens after they get back from retreat...it's at 5 for those of you who don't know...call me if you want to come with, I hope you do :)"

"event","I feel like for a month I've seen nothing but clouds and rain or snow...the sun does not exist in my life right now it seems.  Even when I was in LA it was cloudy and rainy...could this be a metaphore for my life...that it is gray and dull and virtually no excitement except for the occational thunderstorm...perhaps.  Or that despite what goes on, it's just a cover, a mask of what is real, what is true.  Have I been masking myself again, pretending my life is something it isn't?  Even though I know there is something better and real, alive behind what I make it, I can't see it...so do I live it?  Is my life a joke...is everyone else laughing at me the same way I'm laughing at me...am I oblivious am I a joke, the joke?  Even now as I sit at the window and stare out towards the sky a piece of the clouds have broken to let in a sliver of light, it's a reminder of the truth...it shows the beauty of what is real...it sparkles it is pure, but it doesn't last...it will soon be gone and leave me in the gray, boring life that I lead, with little reminder of the life I want, but I will pretend that is the life I lead."

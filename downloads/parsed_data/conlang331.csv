"event","I finally figured out how to switch back and forth between images -- so I can be Saruman in one post and Eragon in another!

The trick is to give them keywords (which I hadn't bothered to.) Then, in Deepest Sender, hit Post Options, look at the bottom and you're given options for which picture to use. Snazzy!"

It was created by EowynOfRohan on the Timeless boards (http://s8.invisionfree.com/elvenkist), she'll have a website with her images (nearing 100 avatars/sigs/wallpapers) soon!! (Once she gets hosting. . .) Anyway, here's my nifty sig:

"event","I'm looking for suggestions for a new design for ANM (my website, currently offline, see post below.)

What I'm trying to do is a sort of techno-type design -- a bit spiffier and fancier than what I've got. I don't want to do a premade-template thingy, but I will take suggestions of what it should look like. I was trying just a simple box theme but that wasn't really. . .well. . .what I wanted. I'm sort of bored with the conventional  sidebar/navbar design, although I definitely like my current design, I think the web needs some stuff that's a bit more interesting and innovative. Especially just box designs or table designs -- sorta boring.

My older and fancier designs were bad on readability and on dialup users. . .so I decided to go simple -- which I still want anyway -- but maybe a tiny bit less simple!!"

"event","I have a question. If I upload two images, how do I use one instead of the other as my image next to the entry, or does it always have to be the default one? Because I have a couple uploaded and I wanted to switch between them, but for some reason I know Deepest Sender just gives me the default -- any way to change this?"

"event","Hey there! You'll notice I have a default user picture thingy up. It's funny that on pretty much every LotR/Tolkien forum my username is Gandalf-related, and yet my usual sig and avatar are both Saruman. . .

Anyway, I got the avatar (and my Saruman sig and my Samwise sig) from EdgeOfNight on the Centauri NetX forums -- eventually she'll have a website up with all her images (she's almost at 100 different sigs/avatars/wallpapers!!) But, of course, accumulating the posts to get hosting takes time and CNX is STILL switching servers. (Come on guys, get a move on!)"

Having done all my computer work for the day, chores, flute, etc. I think I'll go read some before bed. Not sure what I'll read. . .I want to re-read the Belgariad and Belgarath the Sorcerer/Polgara the Sorceress (two of the best books ever) and definitely some more Neil Gaman -- but all of that stuff is at the library so I'll have to wait.

Anyway, post more later!"

"event","FireFox has been giving me some trouble. . . :( It shut down and when it started up I had to create a new user, which, of course, meant I lost ALL of my extensions and themes. However, going through <a href=""http://extensionsmirror.nl"">http://extensionsmirror.nl</a> meant that I found tons of new and cool ones -- including a Spell checker. . . that unfortunately doesn't work for Deepest Sender.

FireFox 1.0 Final is out for those who don't know -- so head over to <a href=""http://getfirefox.com"">getfirefox.com</a> and snag a copy! It is indeed the best browser ever!"

"event","Guten Tag!

I justed finished lesson 6a in my German textbook. (The lessons go lesson 6, lesson 6a, then lesson 6b.). I've actually finished more than that, since this is lesson 6 of Unit 2, and I've alread done Review Unit and Unit 1. It's quite a neat distance learning course -- for more information go to <a href=""http://germanonline.okstate.edu"">germanonline</a>.

I'm working on my current conlang, Kurash, although it's not going QUITE as well as it was a little bit ago. So I need to open up TeXnicCenter and get some work done!

Since it's Saturday I've got some time on my hands for that and other stuff. Maybe figuring out a new design for ANM. . .or something like that. BUT I've got to do some work cleaning my room, and chores and stuff so don't expect too much!"

ANMBlog has a new home, because my current host (<a href=""http://centaurinetx.com"">Centauri NetX</a>) does not allow blogs.

I will be customizing the layout later, so for now you'll be stuck with this (not extremely beautiful) design.

I am posting this using<a href=""http://deepestsender.mozdev.org""> Deepest Sender</a>, an extension for the browser <a href=""http://getfirefox.com""> FireFox</a>. 

I'll post more later, for now, farewell!"

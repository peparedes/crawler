This Sunday (7/22) I will be flying to Costa Rica.
I am being sent by my work to train a class of new agents.
So in the end I get a paid vacation to Central America, and a nice feather in my cap for work.
Good times.
I should have access to my email, as well as chat while there, so feel free to stay in contact, for those few of you who do anyway:)"

So we orders us some foods, gets our drinks, and commences to waiting.
Then we waits some more.
And then just for something different, we wait.
At this point, I am starting to wonder if the simians behind the counter have forgotten how to make a simple sandwich, and I look down at our receipt to see if there is anything that would confuse such simpletons.
Then it suddenly became clear.
We had been given ticket #404
Then, then my friends, it all made sense."

"event","So I find myelf realsing the following things...

I own a house, 
Yet I do not have a home...

Two lovely ladies beside me, 
And somehow I am all alone...

I have reached the point in my life where I truly know who I am, 
However, I do not have the time to simply be me...

Each day I do so much, 
Yet each night I sit alone, with little to show for it, and much left to do...

Somedays I do wonder why I bother, 
but overall I realise it is simply because people need me too.

One day I hope to be able to live for me, 
but until then I guess I will keep doing all that I do, so that others can somehow do what they need too.

I need a drink......"

"event","Well, Candice, Gwynn, and I just finished watching the new movie adaptation of RENT.
It was good.
Actually it was fucking good.
If you have not seen it, do so.
If you have seen it, but have friends who have not, drag them out to see it.
It made Gwynn cry.
It made Candice cry.
Heck, it even made my cynical ass cry.
I was not expecting that, but there it is.

And more than that, it reminded me just how lucky I am to have the women I do, and just how much I love them.
In fact during one seen, ( a wake none the less) I had a vision of the future I would like to see.
I saw myself standing behind the ladies, my hands on their shoulders while they held hands.
The three of us standing in front of all the people that matter, and declaring our commitment to each other, in that typical sappy ceremonial way.
In the meantime one of the songs from this movie (which I will drop in below the cut) plays in the background.
The three of us crying at what it means, likely with most of the people there having no idea why we are so torn up, but fuck them, it is for us anyway.

So, just to say it again, I am amazingly lucky, and I love my women more than I could ever even express to them.

I'll Cover You Lyrics

(Angel)
Live in my house
I'll be your shelter
Just pay me back
With one thousand kisses
Be my lover - I'll cover you

(Collins)
Open your door
I'll be your tenant
Don't got much baggage
To lay at your feet
But sweet kisses I've got to spare
I'll be there - I'll cover you

(Both)
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love,
On life - be my life
Just slip me on
I'll be your tenant
Wherever - whatever - I'll be your coat

(Angel)
You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle

(Collins)
No you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat

(Both)
I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are, my love,
On life - all my life
I've longed to discover
Something as true as this is

(Collins) (Angel)
So with a thousand sweet kisses 
If you're cold
I'll cover you 
And you're lonely
With a thousand sweet kisses
I'll cover you 
You've got one nickel only
With a thousand sweet kisses
I'll cover you
When you're worn out and tired 
With a thousand sweet kisses
I'll cover you
When your heart has expired

(Both)
Oh lover I'll cover you
Oh lover I'll cover you"

First up, this has to be one of the better relief fund gathering efforts that I have seen, and I fully support this site.
Everyone please check out <a href=http://www.boobs4bourbonst.com>Boobs for Bourbon Street</a>

"event","Any of you who truly know me should know by now that I am a crusader for truth, rationality, and critical thought.
It is for this reason that I am appalled by people I know, who I would otherwise consider to be at least rational, and usually intelligent believe in certain things, just because they are told they exist, without putting any honest thought into it.

For some I believe this is caused by how they were raised. Especially if they were raised with any particular religious bent, as the core of most religions is blind faith, and you are taught to not actually think things through on your own.

In an effort to help bring people out of their own self imposed dark age, I will begin providing some material that I hope elicits some thought, and possibly even some debate or discussion.

To start this off I would like to bring up the subject of Astrology.
It seems that there are not only millions of people who believe in this prehistoric notion, which originated before we even knew what caused rain, and somehow continues to this day.

Rather than duplicating the work of many others, I would encourage anyone who is truly willing to think about what it is they believe in to have a read over the following article, found <a href=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html>HERE</a>

Now this is not the absolute end of this debate, but it is a good simple place to start thinking about this, with links to much more in depth research.

If anyone would like to discuss or debate upon this subject, please feel free to post a reply, I do not discriminate based on contrary opinion, afterall, this is being done to foster real thought on the subject."

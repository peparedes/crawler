"event","For all the kiddies out there in white amerikkka tryin to keep it real with tha brothas and tha sistas heres a little bit of hood gospel to influence your mind.  Now pay attention and listen real closely to how I break this slang shit down.
If you 730, that mean you crazy
Hit me on the hit means page me
With new clothes on, I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
And if you got double-crossed, you got f**ked
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
If you got killed, you got left
If you got the dragon, you got bad breath
Max mean to relax
The food you eat is your grub
A sweat box is a small club, your ticker is your heart
heated is mad
your food box is your belly
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine, she's a dime
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard long stare is a grill
Smilin' is cheesin', bleedin' is leakin'

So there it is, that should be enough hood talk to get you by, eh.  Anywho fantastic night, THANK YOU for asking me here."

"event","So, have you ever tried to pick up the pieces of a broken life.  It's impossible.  Trying to hang on to the only thing you want when at times it feels like you're a couple of magnets.  Sometimes you completely stick together, and then there are times when one of them is facing the wrong direction and no matter how hard you try you just can't keep them together.  Death must be easy, because life is hard, it will leave you physically, mentally and emotionally scarred.  HEY THAT RHYMES!!! For the past few months this is the first time in my life that i actually truly know where my heart is.  And it feels good.  But you see there's this magnet that is facing the wrong way and it's not realizing that there is a purpose to all things.  Magnets have one purpose (besides hang stuff on the fridge) their purpose is to STICK TOGETHER, that's just what they do, no one wants to know why.  Like when we were kids and you first discovered that magnets were so fun and you would just pull them apart and put them back together, but no matter what when you were done you would always stick them together.  No one wants to see them apart because there not cool then.  You can't have one without the other, and they wouldn't want to be alone either, because they know that they're pointless without the other one.  When there's one by itself, you know where it goes.... On the fridge, and thats when the life of a magnet is over.  Because then it is surrounded by everything that is fake, that the magnet doesn't belong to, pictures and letters and bills.  It's only there to make everything else look good. sometimes it tries to blend in, you'll see one that has a funny joke on it or in the shape of an animal, but it's all a disguise, no one is seeing it for what it is, a powerful force that desires to be reunited with its counter-part.  When on the fridge it thinks its enjoying life, but never being truly happy.  But sometimes it will try to break away and you'll find it on the floor, trying to get back to reality.  Never truly whole again until joined by its partner.  

That is my theory on LOVE and RELATIONSHIPS, we are a couple of magnets, somehow we will be stuck together again, no matter what something will happen to make it so, whether today tomorrow or the next or in the days, weeks, months to come, while you're on the fridge and i'll either trying to find my way to the fridge to be with you or wait on the floor on the dusty side of the fridge waiting for you to break away."

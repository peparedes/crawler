"event","Somehow I don't feel like we have gotten enough ready for the baby yet.  We have the crib and the carseat/stroller, a few clothes and that is it.  

With the holidays coming up I feel like we aren't going to have time to do much and I'm freaking out thinking that things aren't going to get done.  I'm getting so antsy wanting to get things and set up the nursery but Ash just seems so laid back about the whole thing.  

I don't have access to a car during the day during the week so I can't even go on my own to go buy stuff.  I just want things to be right.  He says well even if you have the baby early, he can go and get the stuff we need because we have it on the registry.  But I just don't want to have to do it that way.  There are things that aren't there that are still needed.  

Anyway, I just needed to vent my frustration some.  I'm just getting that nesting instinct really bad!! :) Knowing me, we will probably have to be induced 2 weeks late or something silly like that and I will have worried for nothing.  

I'm also thinking I need to get my butt in gear and start packing my bag for the hospital.  Yikes.

"event","Well, this morning at about 6am, I heard yelling and screaming outside my window.  I couldn't figure out what was going on, couldn't see anyone, but it sounded like someone was in trouble. I thought at first maybe a domestic dispute, heh, of course my mind goes to that.  I also though oh good there is a car coming through so they will maybe see her. Oh, yes they saw her, but kept on driving!

It turns out a lady had sliped and fell on the ice and we think she broke her ankle.  I don't know how long she had been out there, but she was very cold.  I kept her company while Ash went down to their house and got her husband who brought thier car around to pick her up.  I really hope they went to the er to get her checked, but I'm not sure because she was talking about waiting till a walk in opened.  

What shocks me, and I suppose it shouldn't is that while I was getting clothes on to go out to see what was going on, is that a car drove right by this woman on the ground who was crying and yelling for help.  She said a bunch of other people drove by too.  I just couldn't believe it.  She kept saying to Ash when they were lifting her into the car, that ""Oh, I have to give you something""  We were like no way!  I didn't help out to get something in return, I couldn't sit by and leave someone in the cold in pain.  That is crazy."

"event","I found this on a website that I frequent.  Coming from a family that was fraught with abuse, I can't support a company that allows for the exploitation of children. 

<table><tr><td><h4>It has recently been discovered that Amazon.com has been selling videos that are marketed as ""documentaries"" and clearly geared towards pedophiles or ""boy lovers."" A mother was searching for gymnastics videos for her young son when she came upon this startling discovery. You can read her story on her blog at: http://blamemama.blogs.com/child_porn_on_amazon/2005/11/index.html

Titles include: Gym Boys, Little Warriors go to Summer Camp and others. They can be found by searching Amazon.com, or click here: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000DEYST/qid=1133299206/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl27/102-9929129-0139350?v=glance&s=video&n=507846 (you may have to cut and paste the link if it is ""broken"" because it wraps to a second line).

These titles are labeled as ""documentaries"", but review the user comments and you will see things such as: ""You will love these boys, both pre-teen and adolescents practice for gymnastics. Gym Boys has good character development and it left me feeling as if I know these boys personally. All areas of gymnastics are covered, with interviews of the featured boys. The film has lots of replayability if you love boys.""

If these are ""documentaries,"" why does the filmmaker ship them in plain white wrappers? No one should be ashamed to receive a documentary shipped to them - unless it's not really a documentary at all.

These films are exploiting children, and by allowing them to remain for sale on their web site, Amazon.com is contributing to a very serious problem. According to Crime-Research.org: ""80% of those child pornography purchasers are active child molesters. Child pornographers usually range in age within 10-65... 70% of convicted sex offenders use the Internet."" Amazon.com is only enabling these criminals to fulfill their perverted needs and hurting children and families in the process.

Amazon.com has been confronted about the issue and has stated that ""....our goal is to provide customers with the broadest selection possible so they can find, discover, and buy any item they might be seeking. That selection includes some items which many people may find objectionable.... Amazon.com believes it is censorship not to sell certain titles because we believe their message is objectionable.... we will continue to make controversial works available ..... except where they are prohibited by law.""

How can we make Amazon.com understand that this is NOT an issue of ""providing broad selection"" whether they are or are not technically legal. It's an issue of one of the largest Internet retailers allowing this to go on and perpetuate a very serious problem. It is distasteful and only shows that it's about money - not moral obligations.

What can you do? Contact Amazon.com (see the end of this email with complete contact info). Contact your local media.

"event","I learned I'm borderline gestational diabetes.  Blood sugar number was 7.6 and GD cut off is 7.8.  My doc says she doesn't like to see anything over 6.9, and over that she considers you to have ""carbohydrate intolerance of pregnancy"".   

I'm measuring 3 weeks ahead, and so she is concerned about uber big baby ect.  I have to watch what I eat in terms of simple sugars ect.  It isn't as horrible as I thought at first.  Trying to keep my chin up. 

I am totally dreading the idea of testing blood sugar, but if I do, I have a monitor picked out hehe.  There is one now that you can test on your arm which means no pricked fingers...just pricked arms.  Much less painful, I've tried it!

Luckily I kinda guessed that this was going to happen since I have a very strong family history of type 2 diabetes and also GD.  I've since cut out all sugary pop.  I found out that our Grocery store carries Diet Rite, which is made with Splenda.  Splenda has been ok'd for use in pregnancy so that is great!  I still get my sweet but without the 15 teaspoons or so of sugar that is in regular pop.  

In a way this is a blessing.  It is making me take a long hard look at my relationships with food and how I have always used it as a symbol of comfort and love for myself.  It is also making me realize that it isn't the end of the world if I have to go for a walk after having a chocolate bar.  :)

In other news, Heh.  I have been super busy trying to get things done.  I'm knitting a shawl for myself, making xmas ornaments to give as xmas gifts.  Trying to get in 30 minutes of exercies a day.  Oh, and post whoring of course! We have to go shopping this weekend to get some more baby stuff, and I'm trying to get the list together.  Baby is going to be here in 10 weeks!  Holy Sh!t.  :)  We got the crib last week and I have it set up."

Pure Nerd
65 % Nerd, 26% Geek, 30% Dork
For The Record:

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.
You scored better than half in Nerd, earning you the title of: Pure Nerd.

The times, they are a-changing. It used to be that being exceptionally smart led to being unpopular, which would ultimately lead to picking up all of the traits and tendences associated with the ""dork."" No-longer. Being smart isn't as socially crippling as it once was, and even more so as you get older: eventually being a Pure Nerd will likely be replaced with the following label: Purely Successful."

"event","She wasn't sure what to make of all of them.  All of the people she saw.  They raced around, collecting memories of the fun they were having with everyone they could get their hands on.  Someone was being lied to every second of every day.  Someone, somewhere was receiving a fake smile and a phony laugh, and they were pretending to believe it and dishing them out themselves.  They were pretending their way through days, and soon it would be weeks and months and when the year was up, she wondered, how would anyone know the difference between the lies and the truth?"

"event","She walked into the room, and she knew immediately that she was too late.  Nothing was as it had been.  The furniture had been moved.  The pictures were of people she didn't recognize.  She listened to stories that she was hearing for the first time, because they were not memories that she was a part of being retold but a recap of days that she had not been around for.  She stood in the middle of this unfamiliarity, and she didn't feel sad, or forgotten, or regretful.  She felt incredibly fake, because here she stood, in this room, trying to pretend like nothing had changed when in fact, everything had.  She felt like she needed a break."

"event","whispers of shortcomings
they come louder and faster with each breathless movement
Logic, why do you allude me?
four years old, I want what I shouldn't
I beg for simplicity
bring me placid waters
oh Bengals, comfort me 
take me to sleep
take me to dreams that speak the truth
all I want is to want to wake up."

"event","......There was a humming noise at the back of her mind, so she sat down on the couch, claiming exhaustion from the demanding day, and drank a glass of wine, feeling simultaneously thirty-five and four years old.  She jumped up to spin the volume on the record player higher and had a dance with herself to a song she found pleasant, mumbling the words as she went.  She felt quite improved.  Thoughts of the past few days crept into the darkest recessions of her mind, and promised to stay there for at least a few hours.  She bargained and pleaded and got herself out of the house, hoping to see him, but she found him distant and aloof and trying to forget his demons as hard as she had.  Her thoughts came screaming back, like a semi truck colliding with her brain.  She wanted to cry, but she was in a room full of strangers, so she held back in the self-restraining manner she had cultivated over the years of many stranger-filled rooms......"

"event","I didn't know what to make of this mess of a girl before me.  Seconds ago I had known her only as a girl.  Seconds ago, she was smiling, and everything was so much easier to deal with.  Happy people make life so much nicer for everyone else - no one wants a mess to clean up, a problem to deal with.  When everyone smiles, and at least acts happy, life can go on as planned.  When people break down, that's when the trouble starts. That's when questions like ""Are you okay?"" arise, questions that are terribly difficult to answer, questions that the no one really wants a truthful answer to.   This girl in front of me, I didn't want a truthful answer from her.  I wanted her to look up and say, ""Of course, I'm fine.""  I wanted her to smile convincingly enough to rid myself of any leftover guilt I might feel later about not trying to help.  This was the sort of girl who you didn't have to worry about saying ""no"" to a question like that.  This girl always mustered up a smile and some sort of believable explanation.  Instead, in a rare second of eye contact, I saw all the tears she'd cried in her lifetime.  I saw every single time she'd lied to a person like me and said she was okay.  I saw a million people who had looked back at her and believed the facade they saw.  I saw the one, two, three, or four people she'd tried to explain to.  I saw them turn away, just like I did."

or at least I thought I was.
I'm ready for revision,
and I'm sorry because that wasn't supposed to rhyme.



these weather patterns remind me all too well of the same weather patterns last year and the memories that go right along with them.

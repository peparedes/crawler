I went to work & when i was there i always look @ the classified ads for dogs. Usually because im lookin' for a rottweiler for brandon or a beagle for me. And i found a couple that had 7 puppy beagle :D for only 150$. She lived out in farmington hills so me & brandon drove out there. <b>picked out a boy puppy that we liked very much :D we gave her a 50$ down payment so she would hold the dog until i got my check thursday :D:D ahhh im so excited.</b>n me & brandon left & we went to Taco Bell. Number 5 baby :P and we discussed dog names. I first brought up the name hunter. I liked that because beagles are a form of hunting dogs, But then brandon brought up the movie, ""The fox & the hound"". So we decided copper :D:D Im bouncing of the walls right now, i cant wait. My parents dont care, they're gonna help me take it to the vet & what not, but im paying for everything, Shots, food, collar, leash, bowls, toys ect. Because its MY dog. Dur dur. lol. Its only staying at brandons until it get potty trained half way decent :) but then its here 24/7 w/ me :) yawp yawp. So now im home since brandon went to telegraph & i have work @ 8 in the morning.

I woke up, went to work AGAIN. Brandon came & picked me up from work, we met up w/ his mom & she gave us the dye for my hair. She used to be a professional so i trust her w/ my hair :) I wanted my hair back brown w/ blondish streaks so she gave us all the shit to mix & what not. Then i went home showered, tanned, got ready, went to the store to buy kiani a card for her birthday. We went to Kianis for her suprise party. It was tight :D Sandbox heroes were there & alot of others. I was so happy to see kiani, and to let her know i cared bout her :P thats why i went. Me & brandon chilled there a little bit. and then we had to leave to go back to his house to do my hair. We did it & it came out perfect :D i couldnt be happier. But i still needed the streaks, i was gettin them sunday. I went home, i had work for the 3rd day in a row. :(

I wake up & get a call from brandon, (he's @ work) he says we're gonna paint his room today :) i was happy, just cause its something to do :oP Then a little later while im chillin' in the living room, my mom & dad walk in. They look @ me and grin. Lol i was aware they were up to something, so i asked them what? And they said <b>Are you & brandon having sex?</b> In shock, i kinda just sat there lol. Then i burst out laughing & gettin' all red. Then my mom goes, ""Omg you guys are fucking?!"" lol and i said ""no mom, were having sex"". lmao. They were bound to know sometime, so i guess that was the time. they werent mad, they understand, Me & Brandon have been going out for 7 months now & they were expecting it sooner or later. Lol. Oh well, they just want us to be Safe or w/e. I called brandon and told him my parent know. He was kinda glad we got that off our chests. And now we can have more freedom & i wont be as tied down :) so its all & all a good thing :P Later on that day brandon picked me up & we went to his house to paint his room, i mostly layed down & watched him paint :P then we were just joking around and play fightin, when brandon took my ear and blew in it REALLY HARD, i heard a pop & i got all teary eyed. My ear hurt so bad. I didnt know what happened to it, well i dont remember what else really happened, so im guessing, i went home & went to bed.

So i got medicine for that.Then i came home tanned, showered & what not. Brandon picked me up & we went to his house, chilled, went to the mall, washed his car, got food, watched Cops :D lol & whatever else. He took me home around 9:30ish since he went to go chill w/ kimble for a little bit. Then around 11ish i called him because this boy named ""Lee Peterson"" Kept calling my house and calling my dad a ""nigger"" & ""Motherfucker"" and my dad is a big dude, and i wouldnt fuck w/ him.

I woke up early, and went to work. During my break @ work brandon called me & said we were gonna head out to Fowllerville for the day since it was his cousins birthday :) He picked me up from work & took me home so i could shower & what not. Then around 4ish he picked me back up & we headed out there, which is about a 1 hour drive. When we got there we chilled w/ his 16 year old cousin Alan. They live on a farm :D. <b>((Im an animal lover))</b> They have about 10 cows, 4 baby cows, Chickens, 4 dogs, 3 cats, goats, pigs, ect. Lol. so we chilled out there went for a walk in the woods to Alans little bridge thingy that he made that runs over a creek. It was tight :) Then we went back to the house and i played w/ the baby cows lol. One of the big cows doesnt like Alans little dog ben so the cow tried to step on the dog, so alan kicked the cow. lmfao. Me & Brandon seemed very amused by the cows lol. They're so stupid. Im in love w/ his chocolate lab Lucky, But not after she humps my leg. lol, yeah shes a girl but she still humps me since she smells my dog. haha. We ate dinner & cake there, and we let alan drive brandons car around since its in the country, they were speeding around. Then brandon made me and alan get out of the car because he wanted to see how fast his car could go in the ""half mile"" He ran about a 12, which was pretty tight. A little bit after that me & brandon headed home since we had to go to cedar point in the morning :) Me & Brandon got in a intresting converstation on the way home bout haunted shit. So he drove me to the haunted insane assylum on 7 mile & haggerty? It was private property so we only looked @ it from the car. Then he took me to the haunted cementary in Wayne, it was f'n creepy lol. Then he took my to Elouise, the other haunted insane assylum right on Michigan Ave. We drove right up to the back buliding it was all beat up & old. I was scared so brandon thought it was funny to pull right up to the windows and make the car stall. :oP hes gay. lol but after that he took me home & i went to bed. Then around 2 in the morning i was woke up by my mom & melissa yellin on the phone to my dad. Since my dad was at the bar,drunk, and he ran into my REAL dad. And he almost got in a fight w/ him and chased him to his house & what not lol. Oh well, thats what you get for not calling your kids in 2 years :) Then i went back to bed.

I woke up @ about 7, called brandon he came over then we left for cedar point. We drove w/ Melissa((my sister)) & her boyfriend Brian. We got there @ about 10:30. Rode everything BUT the dragster since it was a 4 hour wait the whole day. But in the middle of the day it starting raining, it only rained for about 20 minutes, and everything was shut down for a while so we got inline for millenium, me & brandon got a cute picture on there :) Then we ate, i had some fries and brandon ate a hot dog, a pretzel, and then the rest of my hot dog. lmfao, then after that my aunt bought us icecream & he ate all of that, lmfao. What a pig :oP As soon as dragster got all dried off me & brandon were thinking about gettin in line, but then we looked up & you see the dragster go but not make it up the hill & it fell back down, and when it did that something happened and someone got hurt and the ambulence came & we said Fuck that :D lol. Later that night we rode the rides, ecspecially Magnum. :) its so pretty @ night :) the parked closed @ 10 so we left around 9:30, and we slept together the whole ride home :*:D It was a amazing weekend.



I love you brandon, thanks for the wonderful weekend bubbi :* (Kick the cow) ;) haha."

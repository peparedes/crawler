Holding Out For A Hero

Where have all the good men gone
and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss
and I turn
and I dream of what I need.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night.
He's gotta be strong
and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light.
He's gotta be sure
and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life!
larger than life.
Somewhere after midnight
in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
there's someone reaching back for me.
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night.
He's gotta be strong
and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light.
He's gotta be sure
and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night.
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone
somewhere
watching me.
Through the wind
and the chill
and the rain
And the storm
and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night.
He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight.
I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light.
He's gotta be sure
and it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life.
I need a hero. I'm hoXding out for a hero 'til the end of the night."

""Sarah"" 
My name is Sarah 
I am but three, 
My eyes are swollen 
I cannot see, 
I must be stupid 
I must be bad, 
What else could have made 
My daddy so mad? 
I wish I were better 
I wish I weren't ugly, 
Then maybe my mommy 
Would still want to hug me. 
I can't speak at all 
I can't do a wrong 
Or else I'm locked up 
All the day long. 
When I awake 
I'm all alone 
The house is dark 
My folks aren't home 
When my mommy does come 
I'll try and be nice, 
So maybe I'll get just 
One whipping tonight. 
Don't make a sound! 
I just heard a car 
My daddy is back 
From Charlie's Bar. 
I hear him curse 
My name he calls 
I press myself 
Against the wall 
As I try and hide 
From his evil eyes 
I'm so afraid now 
I'm starting to cry 
He finds me weeping 
He shouts ugly words, 
He says its my fault 
That he suffers at work. 
He slaps me and hits me 
And yells at me more, 
I finally get free 
And I run for the door. 
He's already locked it 
And I start to bawl, 
He takes me and throws me 
Against the hard wall. 
I fall to the floor 
With my bones nearly broken, 
And my daddy continues 
With more bad words spoken. 
""I'm sorry!"", I scream 
But its now much too late 
His face has been twisted 
Into unimaginable hate 
The hurt and the pain 
Again and again 
Oh please God, have mercy! 
Oh please let it end! 
And he finally stops 
And heads for the door, 
While I lay there motionless 
Sprawled on the floor 
My name is Sarah 
And I am but three, 
Tonight my daddy 
Murdered me.

Gayle Jones Staples

 its hella erking when someone asks me whats going on with my personal life, and, i have no clue. like, all i really know what to talk about is whats going on with them, not me. not like i dont have a personal life.... i just dont know what to say...what to do... how to get it out in words.....i find myself clenching my fists... wanting to do somthing... hit somthing anything...i feel out of control.... like the next bad day could make me snap in two.....
and its not like i dont have anyone to talk to, i just dont know HOW i can talk to them.... like i cant talk.... yet i can.... yet ... i CANT.aaaaaaaaaaaahg its sooo confusing... i can help.... yet not help myself... everytime max or someon says they can do stuff for me like introduce me to .... to peoples(lol) i dont realy say anything...  because i just DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY..........yes? i dont care? yaaay? no ima doit my own way?

one more kiss could be the best thing 
one more lie could be the worst
and all these thoughts are never resting 
and you're not something i deserve

in my head there's only you now
this world falls on me
in this world, there's real and make believe
this seems real to me

you love me, but you dont know who i am
i'm torn between this life i lead
and where i stand
you love me, but you don't know who i am
so let me go
let me go

i dream we head to what i hope for
and i turn my back on loving you
how could this love be a good thing
when i know what i'm going through

in my head there's only you now
this world falls on me
in this world, there's real and make believe
this seems real to me

you love me, but you dont know who i am
i'm torn between this life i lead
and where i stand
you love me, but you dont know who i am
so let me go, just let me go

no matter how hard i try
i cant escape these things inside
i know, i know
but all the pieces fall apart
you will be the only one who knows
who knows

you love me, but you dont know who i am
i'm torn between this life i lead
and where i stand, 
you love me, but you don't know who i am
so let me go
just let me go...

stupid human. hey... why is it all i do is post lyrics? i should stop that. childness. i dont know this is all just stupid. mbm is in a confusing situation right now. im just glad i cleared up my name. see if i ever get in a issue problem like that again.
so things are ok as of now. home alone again. feels good to know that....no creepy sayings/thoughts/words thank goodness.
i like singing. 

stupid human. all you care about is yourself. look around you. theres things out there that could bite you in the butt and you wouldnt know what to do about it. becarefull where you tread, beacuase you could tread on death, and then noting would make sense to you, becuase you didnt have time to figure out that stuff becuase you wasted all that time worring about stuff you shouldnt have, and there you go. sayounara nice to know ya sorry and goodbye, old age does get the better of us."

no.




And its been a while, since I could hold my head up high 
And its been a while, since I first saw you 
And its been a while, since I could stand on my own two feet again 
And its been a while, since I could call you 

And everything I can remember 
Is fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered 
I stretched myself beyond my means 

And its been a while, since I couldn't say that I wasn't addicted
And Its been a while, since I couldn't say I loved myself as well 
And its been a while, since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And its been a while, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you 

And everything I can remember 
is fucked up as it all may seem
the consequences that are renedered 
gonna fuck things up again, again 

Why must I feel this way 
Just make it this go away 
Just one more peaceful day 

And its been a while, since I could look at myself straight 
And its been a while, since I said I'm sorry 
And its been a while, since I've seen the way the candles light your face 
And its been a while, but I can still remember just the way the you taste 

And everything I can remember 
Is fucked up as it all may seem....to me I know
I cannot blame this on my father 
He did the best he could for me 

And its been a while, since I could hold my head up high 
And its been a while, since I said I'm sorry"

"event","30 THINGS GUYS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GIRLS: 

1.Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do.

2. DON'T CHEAT ON THEM. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud.

3. Beware of every single male relative and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your butt at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the darn hat.

4. Never miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful.

5. Don't refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous.

6. If they slap you hard, you deserved it.

7. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms.

10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales.

11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy..

11.5 Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time!

12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship. (Muahahahahahahahahaa--Sweatshirt definatly!!!)

13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely.

14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to beat the Crap outta him.

15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer.

16. Never, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh, you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back.

17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went.

18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents, and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals.

19. Don't flirt with their moms...that's just freaky :P.

20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like crap, so be understanding.

21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it.

22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better darn well introduce her as your girlfriend.

23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you.

24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked.

25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle.

26. Memorize their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life.

27. Don't marinade in the cologne, but smell good.

28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice.

29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out.

30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a second.

Yep Yep.  It wasnt 30 acause i didnt like some of them.  So ha."

"event","Yesterday was depressing. Except the first part.  When i woke up in the morning i was happy.  And then i got to talk to Jared off and on and then Michael came to visit me n' bri and sam from Kansas.  he brought some weird friend of his named Jeff.  he was ok, but he kept laughin at me for no reason, cept that i reminded him of some stupid girl he knew/knows.  Yeah whatever.  his problem.  Then i get home and talk to Jared.  For a long time.  Then i make the mistake of asking him what would happen if i liked him.  And he knows.  And he doesnt like me.  He's in love with Sarah Ames.  So yeah.  Adding to that was all the stress of this week, Ethan leaving...and stuff.  So i just broke down and started crying so hard.  It was sad :(.  And it didnt really help.  But then i said something to Michelle and figured out i wasnt just depressed about Jared, and asked me what was wrong.  And then she called me and we talked to for a while.  It was good :)  She made me feel better.  But now i want to call Michael and tell him crying doesnt always help, like i think he said it did.  Well it doesnt Michael.  I'm sorry.  But Ethans not mad at me anymore, which is a good thing.

Richie just called.  he's fun to talk to. We were talking and he swore, there was silence and he realized it, and he was like...oh im sorry!! you didnt hear that!! lol.  It was kinda funny.  I need to work with him on that though.  And i need to call Ambria so we can finish her personal progress by the time she is 14.  That would be good :).  Or even before, even better!  It gets me off the computer and i need that.

TOO LONG.  So uh, The End.

It must totally suck to be depressed all the time to feel alone, and not loved and have to rely on a guy to know you are loved.  Thats where church kicks in for me, if i feel alone or whatever, i get to church on sunday, and i know I'M not alone, i dont need a guy to get on with life, i just need My Father in Heaven.  And i'll make it thru my tests and trials without feeling alone and half dead.  I'm greatful i dont have to be low enuf to cut my self out of depression or frusteration.

"event","Hello.  It is 9:18 a.m.  It looks like its going to rain.  How sad.

Germany:
I remember there were big feilds and we could walk to the market thing from our apartment.  Our apartment if i remember rite was greyish on the inside.  There was a girl in the apartment in front of us. I cant remember her name rite now.  She was german and we played together sometimes.  It was hard for me to play with her because she didnt really speak english and i only spoke a little bit of german.  I remember one time we were playing with momma's old walkey talkies and she kept trying to stay with me when i wanted to talk to her over the walkey talkies and so we were running around outside and inside.  It was fun.  And i was invited to a party of hers but i didnt stay very long cause i didnt know what we were doing and what was being said and yea...I was in her room one time too and she made me a picture i still have somewhere.  It was of a horse in a field with birds and floweres i think. :)  It was very nice.

I loved the food in Germany.  We would always eat brotchen which is just like a hard roll...and i'd put butter on it and some salami and really good cheese and some other things you cant get in the U.S.  I really like these things Americans would call something like little hot dogs.  They were REALLY good.  I loved them.  And i remember whenever we would eat out...at the nice little bar/resteraunt in the booths and the reseranunt that is really decorted and red.  I would eat snitzel.  Which is like i guess...umm..fried pork chops with a gravy mushroom sauce on it.  THAT was my all time favorite food!

There was this field where we had to take Calli, our black chow chow, and it was HUGE there was this really nice field and we had to take her there because there was no grass or anything by our apartments.

Note to self:  Horse lessons, school, kindergarten, kimmy clark, donvovan, ms. skelton, market, uncle gert goulach, uncle gert's house, deven first word, urgen....

Love Me."

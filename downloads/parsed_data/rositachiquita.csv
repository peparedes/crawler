"event","Sometimes it seems like my life is an assortment of fucked up puzzle pieces that don't fit together no matter how hard I try.  But I'm starting to get them together.  When you try the hardest to force them together, it gets hella frustrating.  But then it just happens.  It seems like all the hard work was in vain.  But in reality, it wasn't.  Sometimes the puzzle falls together like a snap.  Other times it takes a while.  And in that while, you learn things about yourself and the portrait that God is painting that beautifies the painting.  It seems like big sploches of nothing.  But when I look back at my life on my death bed I'll see who I've become.  What I've accomplished.  And how it all fit together.  But it still won't be complete.  When will it ever be complete?  Life truly begins at death.  I'll be amazed at the final product.  It will be perfect, cause God has made me perfect."

"event","Why can't I be someone that I'm not?  

Just for a couple days.  

I want a fling.  with a hot boy.  

But even more than that, I want a fling with someone I know already, but I know that wouldn't be very good for me.  There are a few boys that I know that are the most amazing kids ever!  But if I ever had a fling with them, it would screw up our relationship.  I already did stupid stuff with someone and it screwed up our friendship, but we got over it after a while.....and it's starting again.  

I HATE MYSELF!  Why do I let things go like that!  I can make it stop.  But the thing is.....I don't want it to.  I want a guy that can love me, or at least like me and give me the time of day, even if it's just because he likes my butt or my boobs.  

Can't I get a guy to just go out with me so that I'll know what it's like.  Maybe I'm not too against doing stuff just to see what you're missing out on.  But that means that I'll be going against everything I've stood for.  

But the one thing that I will be able to say is that I took the hard, tough road.  I didn't go the easy way.  Nothing in this life that is GOOD is easy.  It's always hard, with a HUGE payoff later.  

Delayed gratification.  That's what I'm looking for.  Because delayed gratification is so much more fulfilling.  Waiting for the right one to go out with is delayed gratification.  

And an even more bigger payoff is the one in the next life.  To look into my Father's eyes and have him say ""well done"".  OH MAN!  That's all I'm doing now: looking foward to that moment and knowing that I will be able to worship Jesus forever and never stop.  

You know, He's not some egotistical jerk.  He's the only Friend that I have that will NEVER EVER EVER leave me and wil NEVER EVER EVER change!  That's what I long for: friends that don't change.  But then, I know that i change and so my friends will change.

Maybe the reason that God doesn't want me to go to college yet, is that I have to wait for the perfect time to find HIM.  The one who I'm supposed to live happily ever after with.  And I don't want to find him for another 3 or 4 years AT LEAST!  

but I want someone to put on my arm.  Even if he's not ""the one"".  I wish certain people were older....and I wish certain people didn't move away....and I wish certain people would have kept loving me....and I wish that certain people would ask me out!"

"event","I hate super religious spiritual people.  I'm fine with being a christian, I love Jesus, in fact, I've never been more in love with Him.  But when people get into legalism, it sucks.  I've been going that route more and more since I've been around certain people.  And I'm sick and tired of it.  I want to be more like Jesus.  Telling people to eat his flesh and drink His blood.  I'm sure people were shocked at that.  If he was living in our time, would we be hypocrites and despise Him just as much as the pharisees did?  Probably a lot of us would.  Jesus, make me more like You, and less like Your people, cause they're doing a crappy job at being like You.

THE END

"event","Nikki's too scared to talk....I don't blame her.  I try to get things through, but no one listens.  I try to speak through Nikki, but sometimes she is so timid to say something that really matters, because someone might come against her, or she might say it in the wrong way and it will drive someone away from her.

But now I will talk....maybe no one will listen, but both Nikki and I will feel much better when this is all out, and maybe, just maybe, Nikki will have the courage to post this on her live journal, and maybe even say it out loud...

Nikki: Someday, rosita, someday...

Rosita:
How many people out there go partying and feel fully satisfied when they are done?  How many people fill that hole inside of them with ""shit"" and don't actually fill it up?  How many people feel empty inside when they should be full considering how hard they try to fill themselves?  I can testify to the fact that I am full!  That hole inside of me is satisfied.  It is not a hole anymore.  It is full!  Full of life, joy, happiness!  Full of the One who loved me before I ever even thought of selflessly loving someone else!  Full of the One who loves me even after I scorn Him, mock Him, deny Him, murder Him.  Full of the One who tries His hardest to get me to realize that I don't have to do all those things to make me feel happy.  Full of the One who cares about me enough to set standards and boundaries in my life, so I won't be hurt.  It kills me to see people filling this hole with things that make it seem eternally empty.  Why?  WHY????!!!!!  I have the answer!  Right here, in the palm of my hand, I have the answer!  Spare me your disbelief, keep your complicated excuses.  I can show my heart, my soul, my living spirit.  And why is it living?  Because I have the One inside of me that not only breathed physical life into me, but spiritual life as well.  I see so many people that are dying inside.  Their spirits are dying.  They long to commune with the Holy One, but they are continually being smashed by sin and the enemy who wants to see us all in distruction.  He is right there...turn and see His face...He does not look down at you in anger or contempt.  He looks directly into your face with eyes of compassion and sadness.  He has the key to open that hole and fill it with amazing beautifulness!  All you gotta do is show Him the key hole.  And He will do the rest.  Why search, when it's right there? Why be in more pain when healing is just around the corner, you just seem to turn the wrong way everytime you get close to it.  Don't go the easy way to get that easy high.  Why do anything easy way?  They say ""no pain, no gain"".  I want gain!  I don't want the easy way out, because in the end, it is NOT the easy way.  Give me the challenge, stretch me so I can grow!  Stretching is so hard, but once I look back on the times that I have been stretched, I am so much better than who I was.  Small, insignificant, shy, almost nothing.  Why go through the wilderness of finding anything to fill that hole, when you could go straight to the ""promise land"".  Once you get there, it's amazing!  All the enemy wants to do is to keep you from getting there, and he is successful way too many times when all someone had to do was climb the mountain and see the view.  He has turned them away to follow the easy, painless route.  Let me climb the mountain!  Give me the strength to make it up there!  Let me see the glory that You have for me!  I want it all!  Show me what I need to do to get there.  Give me the strength to help carry people up that mountain along with me.  I don't want ANYONE to miss out!"

"event","well, I move tomorrow to seattle.  I'm gonna move before school starts because I want to get a job this summer.  I'll probably try to work at the Wooland Park Zoo, or maybe Point Defiance.  I'm thinking about living in tacoma and taking the train to UW every day, cause it's cheap to live in tacoma!  I was looking at the prices and it's amazing!  I'm just gonna live with myself, cause I don't want to have issues with stupid roomates...So if anyone wants to party with me this summer, just call me and ask for ROSITA!!  that's such a party name! haha...hello, rosita!  hee hee!  I hope I meet some cool seattlite that I can hook up with...yeah, that's the real reason I'm coming to Seattle, haha just playing...kind of ;-)"

"event","So found the tatoo that I want....It's hard to explain.  My friend has a bumper sticker that has a cross in the middle of a bunch of cool squiggly lines, but it looks cooler than it sounds! LoL...Plus I'm going to get a nose piercing very soon.  It's gonna be a ring thing.....yeah....hard to explain....

So I have found the most amazing music that no one ever told me about til now!  Hardcore screamy emo bands.  Amazing....Nikki hates them.....I loooove them...every once in a while I take over her body and force her to listen to it.  It's so deep, and good, and amazing....I dunno why Nikki doesn't like it!  Emery, Norma Jean, and The Great Dissapointment is all I've heard so far....so I need to get more cds of all of the cool bands in seattle.  Btw, I'm moving to seattle to go to college. I'm leaving behind my days of the carefree zoo life!  I'm gonna get a degree in zoology, than maybe work at the woodland park zoo, or point defiance.  I'll miss San Diego, but I know I'll meet awesome people in Seattle, and the fact that all those cool bands originated there is amazing!"

"event","Hey y'all!!!  No, I am not southern, I just like saying that, hahaha (blonde laugh).  So I don't really have a name, I am just Blonde Genius #2....I guess you could call me Sikki.  I am the other half of the Blonde Genius #1, who is also called Narah.  

We do crazy things.....the first time I surfaced was to write a letter to our ""good"" friends about how their band needed some work....not our best moment.  I also surface to star in the Blonde Genius talk show.  Ingenius it is!  We've had many good times, but the best one was the first one....I don't think we can ever live up to that one.  But oh well, it was fun while it lasted.

Hopefully I can come back......I am becoming more and more scarce.....Nikki is getting waaaay too responsible and mature for the Blonde Genius duo.  Poop on her!!!!  She needs to get a life

Nikki: Hey now, that's getting too far, SHUT UP!!
Sikki: fine, fine, fine.......Nikki is cool (hahaha)"

I don't even know how it came aboot.  I was watching monty python, hahaha, no that did NOT make me horny.  I was just thinking about this really hott guy...we're really good friends.  And we always talk about how we both want to make out with each other but we won't because he has a pseudo girlfriend, and they're really awesome together.  I wouldn't mind kissing him.  But I'm gonna be careful because if we are ever in a room together alone, who knows what will happen!!

"event","This is my offical introduction.  I am almost 20 years old, I live in Sand Deigo California, which is where I have many of my adventures.  San Diego is not where I have lived forever.  I have lived many places, seen many things and my personality has evolved in many different ways.

Nikki created me in, I believe it was the year 2000 or so.  My original name was Rosita Chiquita Benita Sanchez.  I was created to help fight off the evils of the slime world.  I greatly miss those days!  We had some good times, me and Josh.  We fought bravely, and eventually beat the evil Justin and Molby (now both are not evil, but I think the war cost Justin his sanity).  After the war ended, I faded away and Nikki tried out some other alter egos, among them Grace, The Blond Genius #2, and many others.  My favorite is Grace.  She is much more conservative than I am.  She is an Irish Lady living back in the 1800s.  She might make visits here from time to time, as well as the the others.  Anyway, enough about the others, more about me!

I resurfaced briefly for a guest role in Nikki and Sarah's first video.  My name evolved into something like Rosita Chiquita Benita Sanchez Letterman Johnson, although I think I'm forgetting some names.  That visit was not one of my favorites, but with counselling (haha) I've gotten over it since then.

Now I am only Rosita Chiquita. My personality has yet to surface completely; the only thing I can tell you is that I am CRAZY!  There are some things about me other than my personality that i can talk about.

I am in love with the ocean.  Every chance I get I am at the beach getting a nice golden tan while surfing my heart out.  There I meet many yummy boys, of which one I have my eye on, but nothing has come out of it yet, and there will probably be nothing to come out of it, or any relationship...I like flirt.  Nothing is holding me down!  Flirt is my middle name!

I love to write music, and of course I am in a band.  All of my fellow lovers of music in this band are the coolest people ever.  Nikki is sooo jealous.  They are pretty much like the people in her band only....cooler.  And of course one of them is that surfer boy that I have my eye on.  mmmm yummy!  that is what I'm talking about!  And he is sooo what I'm into! But who knows what'll happen.  Maybe we'll end up together, maybe not.  But for now, I'm flying free, free as a bird!

As far as looks go, I look pretty much like Nikki, except tanner and a little thinner, but I like to keep some fat on myself.

I have fun now and then, ya know, going to raves, surfing on the beach, playing music on the beach, sleeping on the beach, going to beach parties (the best ever!), going to the drive-in theater and sitting on top of my car just after the sun goes down and while it is still warm, hanging with the ""guys"" of which they say I am one of them (which I'm not sure if I like or not), I love to travel down to mexico, and sometimes me and my buds will drive all the way down to Brazil, where I am from.  Oh, I didn't mention that did I?  Yes, I'm from Brazil.  Great country.  I miss it sometimes, especially the awesome amazon!  I used to live right in the tropics.  Amazingly beautiful!  Last time I visited there I was astounded at how bad my portuguese and spanish was.  I'm too into the whole American culture now!  Plus I'm trying to learn French and all those languages floating in my head might just make it explode!

I work at the San Diego Zoo.  It is sooo much fun!  I swim with the dolphins.  They shouldn't call it work!  IT is tons of fun.  I'll probably do this for the rest of my life, maybe until my music career hits off.  Wow, I actually get payed for doing 2 things that I actually enjoy doing!  

I live with my good friend, and surprisingly the rent is low.  We always have awesome parties and we really don't know half the people that come to them, but it's always cool to meet new people.  Especially the ones in Cali!  Some of them are a little...shall we say back alley?  Yes, I think that is a good term.

Well, I think that is the ending.  I'm not as crazy as some alter-egos out there, but for Nikki, I am!  She needs to lighten up a bit, and my job is to do that for her!"

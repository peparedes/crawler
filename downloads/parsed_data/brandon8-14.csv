"event","Don is starting a new job Jan. 26.  So glad!  He'll finally be putting that degree to work.  This is basically his dream job, back in the IT field.  He has an opportunity for a raise in september of this year.  How many raises did he get in 2.5 years at his current job?  None, actually everyone got pay CUTS!!!  This comapny he'll get rrrrraises and prrrrromotions and be much happier in general."

"event","Well, girls, it's official...  I'll never be having anymore babies!!  Don got his V done today and I am SO happy about it.  Funny thing is, the doc said that the vas deferens (the little tubes that carry the little guys) were very small and had a lot of calcium buildup in then.  He said in most men that have that problem they are never able to have children!  I mean we never even really ""tried"" to have kids.  Brandon was a pleasant surprise and Kiersten we ""tried"" for one whole month!!  I suppose we are just lucky then huh?

No more worries about getting pregnant.  No more babies.  I can now focus my time on raising my kids and then go back to school and not have to worry about being pregnant.  So happy, so so happy.  Don thinks this will make our sex life non existent... I disagree wholeheartedly, I think this will make our sex life awesome.  But then again I need a sex drive, taking antidepressents AND breastfeeding make it really hard on me :(  Plus, where I was stitched up is still extremely sore, I mean extremely sore.  Oh well, that will go away in time I am sure :)

For some being so brave today I am making him homemade shrimp alfredo with parmesan breadsticks for supper.  He ought to know I love him :)"

"event","Tonight we went to the mall.  The mall near us just put in a new play area for kids with cute little toys.  Brandon enjoys playing there and I enjoyed walking around with my daughter shopping for my hubby.  I got Don 3 shirts ($20, $35, and $30) on sale for $28 for all three!  Hell yeah, I'm a good shopper baby!  

For some reason I just don't care about Christmas this year.  It's just ugh... I don't know.  I care, but... my house is already a total disaster area, I certainly don't want a tree up.  I mean, my house is sooooo piggy.  The dishes are mostly done except for tonight's supper dishes, the floor is clean and mopped, bathroom all clean, etc.  However, there are toys EVERYWHERE!!  I can get the dirty clothes washed and dried but folding and putting away, forget it.  There are 3 baskets of clean clothes in my living room and more clothes sitting next to the baskets desperately needing to be folded and I just don't want to do it.  Diaper laundry, oh yeah right... it's also in a basket over by my diaper shelves just sitting there oh so sweetly.  I can't see my desk because it is full of clutter and I don't think my bed has been made since before Kiersten was born!  I have no motivation to put up the tree, to wrap gifts, etc.  I guess I just need to buck up and just go this stuff...  Plus we need a stocking for Kiersten and I'm too damn cheap to buy one... I'm a horrible mother, ha.

On a better note, Kiersten is getting much much better.  She hasn't cried ALL day for quite some time now.  Now if only I could get her to let me put her down sometimes!  She'll be asleep, I'll put her down and she'll fidget, I'll try patting her back to get her to stay asleep, but usually no luck.  But, so long as she's not screaming like she's on fire, I'll make do.

She is 3 months old now.  We're still doing fantastic with breastfeeding and starting solids is not anywhere on the horizon.  My family keeps at me about getting her started on something, but I don't think she needs it, nor is she ready."

"event","Ya know, I realized tonight that no one really knows me online.  I don't really show who I really am.  If I did, I am sure many people would think I am atheist when I am most definitely not, I just don't believe in a Christian God.  I believe in all Gods, how can one religion be the ""right"" one?  My beliefs come from my life, not any one book or teaching.  People would also probably see me as a little overcompulsive, neurotic, and loud.  I overanalyze every situation I'm in.  My house is cluttered, but not dirty.  I am selfconscious and paranoid that people are always judging me.  I'm not good at making friends.  I wish we could really see one another on the internet better.  Anyway...........

I had a great break today...

We went to dinner at a new smokeless (YAY) sports bar with Sam and Rachel.  They are so much fun, I always laugh with them.  The in-laws came up to watch the kiddos and we went out for the day.  Don and I went and got groceries, then went to dinner.  We talked about everything, we laughed.  I had a terrific night.

I also started a new antidepressent.  I really feel this one is helping me more than the other.  I actually feel happy now, giddy almost at times.  I'm not so sad all the time and I actually enjoy touching my husband now (I don't mean sex, I mean just hugging and being lovey in general).  Things are a bit better than they have been... Hope it stays that way.

P.S.  Someone tell Mother Nature that she needs to clear up her dandruff, I'm sick and tired of it.  We already have like 6+ inches of the stupid stuff!"

My latest project.  I love love LOVE this wool.  It is handpainted in my hometown and it's utterly delicious.  There is a wonderful yarn store in my hometown that just opened up and it has yarn in every color of the rainbow, wool, cotton, silk, cashmere... you name it this store has it!  It's wonderful.

Don is looking for a new job.  He had one interview and has a second interview sometime, I don't know when... He's not sure if he wants to go with this company though, they are shirt and tie and Don isn't a real shirt and tie kind of guy.  If either of us would move away from our families Don would make a whole hell of a lot more money.  His skill level in computers is worth a lot, but we don't want to move.  So, we'll settle for a fraction of what he is worth to stay near our families.  Jobs are good here in the QCA but low paying compared to what he could get in Chicago...  No way in hell am I moving to Chicago though, no way.  

Kiersten has decided the past few days that when she is fussy she wants me to put her down.  Odd...  She likes to lay on her belly and I've NEVER put her on her back, Brandon was the same way.

Brandon is calling everyone stupid...  Gah, I think he got that from my nephew.

I need to bake some Christmas cookies, but have no motivation.

I've been working on the leg to my wool soaker for over a week now, but I just can't get myself to finish it.  Don't know why...

---------

Last night I played some Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenal.  I am almost to the end...  I want to upgrade all my weapons and get lots of moola!  I want Ratchet Deadlocked.  Man, I love those games!!!  They are my favorite games to date.  However, Don and I are really looking forward to the new Gauntlet.  Don asked for it for Christmas from his parents.  The first one was really fun!  We beat both Baldur's Gate games, they were really easy.  We've been working on Champions of Norrath for quite some time but have little time when BOTH of us can sit and play together.  Don beat it alone, but we're not very far as a team...

I bought Blade: Trinity last night at Blockbuster.  It was a whole $5 and since I'm in love with Ryan Reynolds I had to get it.  He's cut in that movie, oh he's looking good... hahaha   yes I'm such a nerd!  Plus, Don loves that movie too so..."

"event","I long so bad for a friend around here.  I have a few, but none I can go crazy with.  None I can really let my hair down with and just go nuts.  Last night we went to Don's company Christmas party and I realized that I don't know anyone besides on the computer.  Don and I really don't fit with anyone he works with.  They are either much older than us with kids or younger and not in a serious relationship and no kids.  Let me tell ya, people who don't have children just don't want to hang out with people who do, at least in my experience.

I long to go out with my girlfriends, throw our arms in the air and dance the night away.  How come the only people I could see myself doing this with are online?  

I think it's because I have a complex.  I'm terrified of people.  I mean I'm genuinely terrified of speaking to people for fear that they will think I'm dumb, ugly, that I smell, that they'll see a zit.  I know, how stupid right....

I'm afraid to be myself around people.  I used to be outgoing and lively, but these days I'm so shy and kept to myself.  I'm afraid of people.  There was this girl I used to call and talk to, but I haven't called her in a really long time.  I figured she just didn't like me, so I quit calling her.  She probably liked me calling her, but my paranoia won't let me get close to people.  She probably wonders why I never called anymore.  The last time I spoke with her was when her last son was born and now he's over a year.  I miss hearing from her, I worry about her a lot, but never say anything.  Maybe if she reads this she'll know I'm speaking of her, or maybe she won't.  She seems like such a fun person, the kind of person I USED to be, the kind of person I could go out with and just forget about all my problems.  I mean I'm just such a paranoid idiot when it comes to making friends.  I always think they are just being my friend to be nice because they pity me... 

I need to get over my paranoid delusions."

"event","I have been on DH about painting the new baby's room for months, he's been procrastinating like crazy.  Well, this week he asked a guy from work and his fiance and little girl to come over on Saturday.  I made DH take a vacation day from work yesterday so he could finish painting the room and I could finish it up with the decoration (what little I have).  I asked him if he wanted to look like a slob to that guy and he rolled his eyes and said, well yes, I want my house to look like a pig sty.  HA!  So, it's all done, I just have to put the handles on our new dresser and get the valance hung.  

Our new dresser matches our crib EXACTLY!  It is like it was made for each other although it most definitely was not.  I have most, I think all now, of her clothes all washed and either hung up or folded ready for the dresser.  I have all her diapers washed and ready to use!  I'm so excited :)  when I get the room straightened up a bit (it's a still messy since I don't have everything put away), I'll take a photo and share :)

I really REALLY want to get wooden letters to spell out her name and put them on the wall with pretty pink ribbon.  (the walls are a very pale yellow and the valance and crib ruffle are bright pink with little yellow flowers).  I made her a winnie the pooh fleece blanket and pillow (of course the pillow is for much later).  If anyone has any links or ideas where I can get cute wooden letters for cheap please let me know!!!"

"event","<P>Honestly, I LOVE co-sleeping.&nbsp; I tried very hard to satisfy everyone else when my son was first born and have him sleep in a bassinet beside my bed.&nbsp; Nope, didn't work.&nbsp; I found myself not sleeping a win because I was up constantly checking on him.&nbsp; So, I put him in bed with me.&nbsp; I slept very well and even though I prefered to nurse sitting in a chair, it was still easier than going to the other room getting him, getting a bottle ready, etc. etc.</P>
<P>And for anyone interested in trying cloth diapering, definitely do!&nbsp; It's really no more work than disposables.&nbsp; I mean you have to go out and buy the disposables, but you just wash the cloth, no more steps really.&nbsp; No toilet swishing, especially for newborns.&nbsp; And the pail I have does NOT smell.&nbsp; However, the disposable pail I had stunk so bad I wanted to cut my nose off!!!</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""More about me...""> </P>
<P><BR>Ok, so Kat had a terrific point.&nbsp; Why don't I tell some things about ME and not just my mommying.&nbsp; Honestly, it's because it's hard to remember I'm a person too when I'm at home all day taking care of my child and have no real adult interaction besides that of a few emails here and there, oh and talking to my mom :).</P>
<P>I love music.&nbsp; I don't have the time for it now that I did, but I do love music.&nbsp; I've seen concerts from Pam Tillis to Slipknot and Marilyn Manson.&nbsp; My favorites would have to have been Ozzfest, INCUBUS, Rob Zombie, and Jonny Lang.&nbsp; Yes, Jonny Lang, far cry from the others eh? But that man can sing and play the guitar like no tomorrow.</P>
<P>I hate getting up early.&nbsp; I purposely put my son to bed later so I&nbsp;can sleep in later.</P>
<P>My favorite food is by far Mexican.&nbsp; I can eat tacos every day of the week and never get sick of them!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I don't like doing dishes, so I made my husband buy a dishwasher.&nbsp; I find it hard to fold clothes, they often stay clean in baskets for weeks before I find the energy to fold them.</P>
<P>I hate being pregnant.&nbsp; I like the outcome, but I'm so miserable as a pregnant lady.</P>
<P>I've been to Europe.&nbsp; Italy and Greece to be exact, and I'd go back in a heartbeat.&nbsp; But the Roman subway is not for everyone.&nbsp; If you can't handle the foul lingering stench of BO and piss, don't get on it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I love going on vacation.&nbsp; We went to Disney World for our honeymoon last year.&nbsp; It was awesome!</P>
<P>I'm allergic to cats.&nbsp; In fact, I really hate them.&nbsp; I think they smell and they're just plain disgusting animals.</P>
<P>Hospital personnel and insurance companies don't like me.&nbsp; I am a constant complainer when I am treated poorly, sent out wrong bills, and not given great service.&nbsp; I feel these people are there to serve ME and should treat me well and know what they are doing.&nbsp; If they treat me poorly and act incompetent, I let them know about it and refuse service from them.</P>
<P>I love cereal.&nbsp; I could eat cinnamon toast crunch (even though I really hate cinnamon and anything else with cinnamon makes me gag) or special K berries everyday and never get sick of it.&nbsp; oh wait, I do, haha.</P>
<P>My favorite colors are red and orange.&nbsp; I drive a Maroon Grand Am.</P>
<P>I met my husband online in the spring of 02.&nbsp; We met in person that summer.&nbsp; I got pregnant that fall (not on purpose).&nbsp; Brandon was born August 03.&nbsp; We got married in November of 03.&nbsp; We got married for the right reasons, not for our son.&nbsp; I'd never make that committment just for him, I had to do it for me.</P>

"event","Ok, ok, so I requested to join a community for breastfeeding.  I realized I don't have many actual posts in my journal, so I'm going to try and start posting more so I can join more communities.  Right now I particularly post to and comment in some pregnancy communities and cloth diapering communities.

I don't think I ever did a real intro of myself to anyone on lj.

I'm Kari, 23, mom to Brandon 22 months.  I nursed Brandon as an infant and had little to no support from family members.  When he got teeth, he started biting me and I had no clue how to stop it, so nursing quit.  I am currently preggo with #2 due in Sept. and I am hell bent on making it to one year or longer with this baby.  I would love to use my online journals as support and way to answer my questions in order for me to keep going when I have everyone around me saying to stop!

I co-sleep (not with my 22 month old anymore as he's too wriggly), but I will be co-sleeping with my newborn.

I cloth diaper.  Again, the only support I get is from my husband on CDing.  Everyone else claims he'd do just as well in sposies...  I know that's not true.  He had open bleeding sores on his behind in sposies, and his bumm is as healthy as can be now!!!

Ok, there is a small intro on me.  I can add more as needed :)"

<P>We got this super cute bed for Brandon!!&nbsp; I know he will be so very excited!&nbsp; He currently has a convertible toddler bed, but there is no rail to go with it and all of them I can find just don't fit the bed right...&nbsp; They fit UNDER the mattress and the way his crib is, nothing will work right... ugh.&nbsp; It's only $50 with free shipping, so not bad!&nbsp; Plus, we are having another lil gal in September and we haven't gotten her a crib.&nbsp; In fact we weren't planning on ever buying her a crib.&nbsp; We bought a co-sleeper so she can sleep right next to me.&nbsp; Our bed is a queen, so I don't feel comfortable with her right in our bed, with the co-sleeper she has her own little place, but she'll still be with me :)&nbsp; I guess now after she is done co-sleeping she can move into her crib in her own room...&nbsp; But the co-sleeper converts to a play-yard so she'll probably be in our room in the play yard until I'm ready to move her.&nbsp; When I nurse I prefer baby to be in the same room as me...</P>

"event","Ok, so here is my DIAPERING stash...  No one on Xanga is interested in this, besides Erin perhaps, so I'll just post it here...  Most of this is for Brandon, but obviously the smaller sizes are for Kiersten when she gets here :)

24 premium prefolds
24 infant premium prefolds
2 lg fuzzi bunz
3 WAHM LG pocket dipes
15 3 layer cotton fleece inserts/doublers
12 trifold hemp doublers
1 small HH Halloween print for new baby YAY!!
1 small pink fancy pants pocket dipe
2 Infant sized little lambs dipes (one tye dye and one strawberry shortcake)
2 XL Bumkins covers (red fat farm and yellow bug) (not bad, but not for newborns in my opinion)
1 LG Bummis SWW froggie print (this thing sucks... it leaks all over)
1 LG Proraps Classic (my favorite!  Cut generously enough to hold a trifold prefold or a pinned prefold.  Absolutely NO leaks with this cover, wonderful!!!)
1 WAHM Bob the builder cover with yellow PUL (Actually my favorite at home during the day cover.  So very very trim)
1 LG WAHM aqua PUL cover (Still in the mail!!)
4 pink NB Proraps (these are the tiniest things ever!!  It's hard to believe anyone will fit in them)
1 MD AIO by My Precious Baby by April (SO FREAKING CUTE!!!)
36 or so fleece liners made by me (just cut from anti-pill finding nemo fleece)
36 flannel wipes made by me out of old receiving blankets
1 LG fleece cover made by me (circus animals quite pilly, but one of my favorites for at home use... so breathable)
1 LG fleece AIO made by me (same circus animals print)

1 13 gallon trash bin as a diaper pail lined with a plain garbage bag
TTO
wipe solution made by me using filtered water, a few drops of TTO, and baby shampoo
a few stick ups I stick on the inside of the diaper pail
Lots and lots of baking soda
2 pairs diaper pins

I PLAN ON GETTING

12 small fuzzi bunz (Don insists on these as he can't use a snappi or pins.  If I want him to change her diapers, then I'll need the easy ones for when he is home, thus I'm only getting 12.)  I am more than capable of using a snappi or pins during the day.  I actually prefer prefolds and covers, but I don't want to be changing every single diaper, so a few fuzzis it is.  With Brandon he doesn't have runny poops, so I can just fold the prefold in thirds in his covers, so Don has no problem changing him, but with a newborn folding in thirds will just NOT do!!
6 Proraps Classic SM covers

After she grows out of that, I will be getting 12 more FB MD and then 6 MD Proraps Classics. Lastly I will get 12 LG fuzzis and 6 more large Proraps covers...  I might change my mind on the large stuff as I have a whole stash of large, but hey... as we all know it's hard to not keep diaper buying, lmao!!!"

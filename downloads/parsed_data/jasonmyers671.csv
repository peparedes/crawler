You will find yourself swimming against the tide, getting nowhere and simply exhausting yourself. Why not go with the tide, flow along with it and get into harmony with what is going on? As you learn to do it, you will find yourself in harmony with everything and everyone around you. You will no longer stick out like a sore thumb, but will blend in perfectly with your surroundings and environment. You will find you are in harmony with yourself, and that harmony within will be reflected without. Life will flow smoothly and all will fall into place perfectly. You will behold seeming miracle upon miracle come about all the time."

2. Meditate as an active listener, not just always the asker.

3. Now summon the angels. (They usually speak in your own thought voice.)

4. Experience the outpouring of creative energy releasing within you like a warm incubator light.

5. Sigh in thanksgiving as you empty your crystal chalice temple of stale thoughts and negative patterns.

6. Be receptive to listening. Let go of those blocks like notions, assumptions, myths and criticism that drown out creativity, risks and unscientific notions. 

7. Bless this declaration and instill positive affirmation rather than those usual notes of self-criticism. 

8. Ask for openness. One that does not criticize yourself. If that dreadful voice arises (and it does), let go of it. 

9. Picture yourself as a vital, enthusiastic, healthy, peaceful and creative sparkle. 

10. Embrace and encounter the unlimited power within yourself. 

11. Recognize that you are a sacred creative being, inspired by angels, full of exciting ideas and boundless creative energy. 

12. Act on your hunches."

"event","i havent eaten for almost two days, the third day i ate the last wheats of oatmeal in the container.  the same night my artery was hurting, i thought i was going to have a heart attack.  oh man oh man did i hurt although i wasnt afraid of what to expect.  because im optomistic that im going to be all right.
i woke up that morning feeling with my heart feeling fine, how ever my stomach was grumbling.  so i went over to the neighbors and picked star apples, pickled em and ate em.  for lunch i was super effin hungry so i went over to the mayors office during lunch and an old friend of mine named carl was there.
we were both starved i told him aww man theres nothing to eat here.  then he replied hafa lai jell what you mean theres nothing to eat here.  i took out a plate of noodles from the refrigerator and warmed it up.  while he was cooking it he kept saying that its bad, it doesnt smell good, lets throw it away.  next thing you know he took bread and ate it with the noodles.  so i figured hey man if i get food poisoning at least i wont be a lone.  so i ate with him it was okay but it did taste sort of funny.  afterwards we drank coffee and smoked cigarettes.  my stomach felt real funny as worse as it did before i ate.  i began to burp, after a few burps out came the noodles, coffee and star apples.  i was like son of a biatch why the freak did i have to eat lunch with a guy who the village people thought should get nominated to be in fear factor for eating the grossest things around and savor it.  crazy because after i threw up a hungry dog came a long and ate what i barfed out.  i smiled then my stomach grumbled again hmmm so i gave up to fill up my tummy.  went home showered drank water, came here and wrote about it.  i dont want to be hungry in now or in the future, is this a wake up call...bleh..!"

"event","last night i had a dream i was in a forest leading the rebellion to safety.  so i took them to a cave which lead to an underground base which was guarded by a psycho rabbit.  i used to my psychic powers to calm down the rabbit and brought the people to a peaceful place.  i then had a mission from i dont know who to go and assassinate the leader of the darkside.  so i went up the elevator and there was a silver jaguar, so i hopped in and went for a ride in the forest.  next thing you know i was getting shot at by big ass red and white robots that looked like optimus prime.  i shot back and dodge there bullets and missles but it wasnt enough to take them out.  so kept driving and driving around trees, making u turns, trying to find exits but they were a bit too small for the car.  so i came to a slope that had a thin trail to go down through so i rammed the jaguar in to one of the robots leg.  i ran then pressed the alarm button to have it self destruct.  it then blew up demolishing a few robots, leaving one.  so i threw it a rock and ran in to the small trail it was a big big slide so i slid down the trail woosh.  i was under a spot light so looked left to right and didnt know where to go so i went straight i had to climb a barbed wire fence, my feet couldnt fit through the holes in the fence so i just went under it.  little did i know it i was at the enemies security booth so 2 guards and a boony dog stopped me.  they were all like [freeze mofo freeze hands where i could see em] so i listened to them got on my knees next thing you know i hear a whistle like sound coming from the right and its a missle from the robot i threw a rock too.  so i jumped and did a cart wheel and rolled benneath the fence.  the 2 security guards turned to ash and the boony dog became hairless.  i found my self with no escape route so i travelled on and found another trail to slide down so i slid down there and got sticker birds all over me and at the bottom of the slope there was a pink yellow and red house that looked like a mushroom.  i went in and there were a bunch of smurfs eating dinner.  they fed me berries and oatmeal then i thanked them and went on my way before the robot destroyer could find me.  it just so happens that magic smurf was on his way visiting the family and he asked me why do i look troubled i told him im on a journey to destroy the darkside.  he replied to me oh goody this may come in handy for you.  so bam he pulls out a pair of chop sticks and shows me how to use em.  you twirl them both around each other in a spiral motion then put em up to the sky to get energy from the spirits, then you face em foward and zap your targets.  off i went down another slope finding my self at another house, this time it was a hoe house how do i know because it said so.  so i barged in and saw a hoe with no teeth and three eyes it looked like she was going to bitch slap me so i did a back flip out the door, put one chopstick to the sky and zapped the hoe, suddenly she had to buck front teeth, one eye, and two mouse ears i giggle and left.  there was another slope i went down on which lead me to the dark forest.  i made my way through and fell down a hole which lead me to the darksides empire.  ring...ring...ring...someone called for the wrong number and woke up"

"event","friday...  i woke up and my uncle joe checked me out to cut grass so i ended up bushcutting for half the day.  strange the day before ive been thinking of joseph, the father to Jesus.  it was around 6 pm that friday, i was on my way to a wedding.  on the way there i sneezed and i heard someone say bless you so i was all like thank you.  my neighbor and i made conversation about finding her dog, its a white fluffy house puppy.  it escapes from the fence and the kids and i catch him and put him back in.  we were through talking so i made my way to the wedding and another neighbor stopped me and asked if i could bring her back some food from the wedding and i did.  soo there i was at the wedding eating and drinking keeping to my self, i left there around 9 pm.  my friend belle checked me out and we went to a karaoke bar.  we met up with about 5 other people which left me with out a seat at there table.  i was drinking heiniken and had no place to sit so i sat with a veteran named joe.  he was drinking the same beer i was 'heiniken' he bought about 6 beers while we were talking.  he spoke a lot of sense for a drunk old man.  the song dancing queen played and he said 'dancing queen?' dont we have a dancing king.
he said if you dance you have to be free, when you hear the beat of that drum you move ""hu-wa"" ""hu-wa"".  he was saying that most of the night i had an idea why but didnt speak of it or ask.   for some reason we had some kind of connection its like i was able to read his mind and he was able to tell what i am capable of and that im special.  he asked to tell him the time so i looked at his watch and it was 11:11 pm.  i could see the war in his eyes and the pain hes seen that people have been through.  weird how i kept seeing signs in the karaoke screen which related to what he was speaking to me of.  when he spoke about being free or love there was a lady in white dancing in a field of dandylions.  when he spoke of war there was graffiti on the wall that said the edge of hell.  when he left i wrote notes on a napkin about the wisdom he shared with me.  through out the whole night he said hu-wa, take care of my self, youre a king, youre a good guy, he pays his child support and that i am blessed.  before he left he shook my hand then patted my shoulder and placed his hand at the top of my head for quite a few seconds.  well hmm not sure if you see the big picture and if you do please let me know.."

"event","october 17th around 9 O'clock i wrote a letter to a friend of mine.  im sitting on the sidewalk writing this letter.  in front of my is grass where we venture, behind the grass is a river that we cross or wade through, passed the river is a baseball field where we play; win or lose.  beyond the field theres a jungle which we go through darkness and mystery, after that the hills which we climb to get to the high ground, from there lies the sky which is infinite.
behind me was the moon, the moon which at the time was an eclipse.  it was beautiful there were various bright colors radiating from the moon.  causing the clouds that pass by to light up like a rainbow cloud.  well i thought about
the journey from the grass all the way to the sky and i realized that we must
conquer every obstacle in life to get where we'd like to be and be who we'd like to be.  all of a sudden i thought music.  [i think we're alone now the beating of my heart is the only sound.  everythings gonna be all right.  in the morning when i rise you bring tears of joy to my eyes.  are you strong enough to be my man.]  i thought of music and i pondered the positive lyrics
of songs that came from people who opened up there heart & mind through words
and how they feel.  then i figured hey these people make a lot of sense and theyve executed there music with much thought & feeling.  so really if you pay attention to the beautiful things in life you could use those feelings you are struck by to succeed in life.  i want to be who i really am, i want to be strong enough to be a lovely womans man, i want my self and all around me to be all right, if i cry id like to cry from joy, i want peace; peace really
exists in the world depending on our perspective in life.  Day one"

"event","hello, today i saw the sunrise, the sun set and the moon shine. i bought water then found my self at a bbq.  it was night, i drank and ate; enjoyed the gifts and blessings of my neighbors, which i am thankful for.  eating is what we all look foward to doing together or a lone.  i heard family stories about underwear size 52, saw two geckos hunt there food, they are and we watched.
theres dogs life stories and the way the way the live.  heard farts and burps smile and laughter.  a kid who is 12 was drenched in laughter from my uncles remarks.  all of a sudden i thought, cosmic power; a self reminder that i have it.  ive felt it before, somewhere in side me; i know i have it.  the gift of knowing, life and the rest.  nations are conquered, theres disease and famine.
our neighbors are evil, we trust so few.  persistant over population and not only man kind.  our earth is decaying, nature is slaying.  does war and destruction keep death at bay.  children and nature suffer prior to us.  i do
as much as i could, to delay demise and dismay.  i end suffice my thoughts this
is enough.  hey!  the moon is shining brightly on us, theres a start that lights, its effin bright.  our supper is over, part we must.  i brought two beers, took it to go.   travelled to the beach, got sand on my feet.  to my left are guys drinking and eating. i drank a beer, down it goes; i look to the sky and im like whoa.  its a block of stars, i must go; travel space in this dimension of time.  i finish my beer, cant wait no longer; come on my dear.  zoom we sky rocket in my mind you know, off to the stars; well wadda you know.
my heart is pumping, blood pressure is rising.  thuh thump thuh thump my blood woes, thuh thump thuh thump is all i hear; thanks to the beer.  thuh thump thuh thump as if im walking, a sound of steps; through the dome in the sky.  from star to star i connect i go.  its a sign so pleasing from pictures of gleeming.  i see nine starts stand out, they look like three vertical bars.
they twist and turn at thoughts my insight, kaboom they go; explosion it looks
seperated from its first form.  rumble and jumble a quake in the dome now pieces of star dust float a must where they go youd never know.  but if i think id solve genocide on a brink.  the thumping stops, tired of walking; so rest i must.  i hop on at once sweet sweet comfort i fall a sleep.  so comfy i cant help but test the fluff of clouds that mist by.  each cloud i slept in diffrent positions, several soothing to the spirit in me.  i am at peace from the moist and cold, this clouds so fluffy im drained my eyes get puffy.  a dream delightful come on and try it.  *Snap* im up what the f..uck!"

i am devastated, fell to the ground or smacked back down.  my entire family my father, mother, brother, sister and everyone else in the tree never seem to understand me at all; nope not notta one bit.  all the neglection theyve inflicted on me had a very negative effect to how i was with society.  id follow others idiot actions, id be beligerant or think racialy wrong, id pick on people and for no reason why.  although through out all that negativity deep deep down in side i was an innocent person, i just didnt have the guidance to lead my own path.  so like wise i was treated like apples by others.  i was always looked down on; despite of my age size charecter or color, id always be appley.  weather it be physical, mental, verbal even spiritual all i got were apples apples apples.  now i ask my self where is my place in life, what is it that i do wrong, or havent done to belong some where.  the only place where i was ever at peace was in the depths of my mind where my life revolved in.  even in that peaceful place of mine, i was condemned to the depths of no where.  i was a humble person although i cannot live at peace, ive never felt an ounce of real love that remains in me.  where is my answer, where is my solution?  why oh why am i consistantly in a state of darkness from which the light does not enter and darkness that i dont seek.
so i ask my self what have i done thats always been right, i reply to my self you are humble, you are brilliant in darkness and light; follow your heart and it will lead the way.  where itll take you; no one knows, what you will find is your life, your heart, your soul your self.  through out all the apples ive been through ive always been truely good at heart, no im older, smarter, stronger, wiser.  no apples exist in my life what so ever, i am who i am and 
mystical is what i am.  no one around me belives me, i belive in my self, the spirit of the world belives in me, the angels and all of heaven granted me the gift of feeling and what i feel for all that surround me, shine on me, smile at me, hate me, hurt me, try to break me, even all that i do not know i love
i care for i cry for i fight for.  i am more than human, am now in the proccess
of deify and once i get there i will be the true me and live in everlasting love of life..."

"event","hello my name is jason i have no job no car no present goals.  i stay in a blue an white apartment that consist of four units.  around eleven pm i walked out of my unit to help my mother bring in groceries.  i stay on the second floor on my way back in there was a dead frog laying there so swept it down with my foot i then put away the groceries munched on pika golai with rice in little japanese style bowl.  when i was through eating i drank and went out to smoke i then looked for the dead frog but i couldnt see it or find it so i sought a place to smoke so i sat on the side walk and smoked while i smoked a guy walked his dog and i had an excellent view of it taking care of business they left so i sat there a while in a trans like state i then rose made my way back in and my neighbor waved at me so i waved back.  as i walked in i suddenly
got startled from stepping on the frog right when i stepped on it made a whistle like squeak so i screamed loud in a low pitch tone, suddenly my neighbors chihuahuas barked furiously.  i then swayly moved to the wall leaned on it my neighbor and her son stood at the door and looked at me my mother then came out then my other neighbor came out then all at the same time they asked what happened whats wrong i said the frog and they all chuckled.  they all went back in i then asked my self is there something i ponder and would like to understand about what just happend so i replied to self there is.  so here i am writing about it with the thought of salvation on my mind.  where ever i am what ever i do it feels like the entire universe is enveloped with my life and i vision pass the universe pass my life and everything in it including yours.  all of what ive experienced, experience and will experience is a key to doors that lead to windows of mystery, mystery so deep its a blessing just to know as a miraculous whole.  i then thought of the frog which was the key to the door that lead me thinking whered the grog come from did a kid throw it up did it hop up and die did it fall from the roof did a cat bring it up.  suddenly i snap in to thinking what do i belive what do you belive what we belive is of utter importance to know what we belive in life dwells the truth the defines out entity.  now im through door in the house at the window and i come to think what do i speak of what i spoke of and i tell my self the frog wasnt just a frog like us and all living things its a life and life is always of great meaning to our existance in the world.  so i come to belive that through anything and everything life is a mystery that you must
seek your self and discover.  the answers lye deep with in the soul of our being.  through out the time of our being the clock ticks and i wonder in time we live we're a live but are we always our selves i reply not we are something
greater and now my thoughts cease and walk through time in the real world."

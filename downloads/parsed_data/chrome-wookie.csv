"event","Today I went to Wendys.  I got a meal #4, biggie size.  It was really good until I ate the onions.  Somehow, the onions tasted like anthrax and made me cough up blood.  I don't like onions and onions dont like me.  

I woke up this morning and turned on my computer.  I was very bored, so I went to go *buy* the game ""Silent Hill 2"" and ""NFS: Hot Pursuit 2"".  NFS finished first so I played it first.  It was fun.  I have a few extra pairs of pants for when I play Silent Hill 2."

"event","Life is throwing too much at me too fast. I just can't do everything anymore. I'm very unbalanced, and I'm pushing myself too hard.

I'm also facing issues of Faith. I don't know what I believe anymore. I know that you can have God without Religion, and Faith without God, but what do you have if you have no Faith? You have nothing. Even Atheism is a kind of Faith. But I don't even have that. My ""beliefs"" on life being energy are ringing, at least to my ears, as the bull shit they are. I just don't know what to believe.

I just have to get over it, I guess. What doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.




What happens if all of this does kill me?"

So, I saw Hot Cross with Melt Banana on thursday. It was fucking awesome. I love Hot Cross. Friday was fun, even though she, again, didn't collect papers. *sigh*

Saturday was many things. We had band practice, and I felt tension the entire time, and I know why. And what Adrian said to me is really pissing me off, although not so bad since I talked to David. Thanks man.

After practice, I took Megan out to see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's an excellent movie. I highly recommend it.

Good things are happening between Megan and I, even if I have no idea as to what they are. But I don't think that matters, so much, because I really like her, and I'm just going to go off of that. Yes. That is what I shall do.

Adrian can go fuck himself if he doesn't like that.

So, I did a lot of thinking tonight. Wondering about the waste that is the last two and a half years of my life. I spent all that time hardening my heart, locking away all my feelings...

I don't know. I just know that if I fuck this up.....nevermind. I'm not going to think about it."

I like Silverstein. I don't know why, they aren't lyrical geniuses or anything, but I like them a lot.

I've been listening to a lot of depressing music lately, but it isn't because I'm depressed. I'm actually quite happy with my life at the moment. Well, parts of it. My car is still trying to fuck me over, and pretty much succeeding, and I still need a new job, but you'll have that. I still manage to be happy, because I have a reason to be happy. I'm feeling things that I never thought I'd feel again. I look back on the last two and a half years.....but you know, I probably needed that. I wouldn't be me without all that depression, cutting, etc. Forged in the fires of Pain, as it were. I definatly found someone worth waiting for, though. Worth that and so much more.

So, those of you that know me, you're probably wondering were all the sentimentalness is coming from. Well, believe it or not, I have a romantic side. I thought I had killed it, but I guess not. Thats life, I guess."

Interesting is the correct word.

Blood pouring out of nose.
Headache, loss of some vision in left eye, twitchy hot/cold ness
More headache, random dizziness, twitchy leg

I did go to a concert tonight, and it was okay. But it helped some with stress.

I am perched on the very edge of breaking. Tonight the insides of my arms were itching like they do when I feel the need to cut. It was a close thing, but I managed to not do it. Thank you, Megan. I don't know how well I would have handled that mess had you not been online.

That entails the good news of the day.

Thats good news because it means I was right. I think I'm going to attempt to patch up that relationship, but I doubt if I will be successful. I don't know how that makes me feel. Somewhere between crying and screaming.

I had a horrible day today, mostly. I had a horrible headache, took two Excedrin, and then it got worse. I was able to push it away for my math exam, mostly by burning out everything in my head. Its this neat thing I read in this fiction series I'm reading, and I didn't think it would work, but it did. Which was cool.

My car has decided to fuck me again. I hate it. Something related to the cooling system isn't working right, so I don't know if its going to explode or not. I hate it so fucking much.

The Arcade Fire is a wonderful band. They're trying to make me feel better. I don't know if its working.

Maybe I'll just pull out the wonderful solution of slicing up my arms tonight. *sigh*

Friday night was cool, there was talking and bonding and wondering about the color of my eyes.

Saturday was cool, we started multi-track recording, which is such a pain in the ass, but it was fun to hang out with Nathan, Zack, Adrian, and Justin. Mary was there, too, but I don't know how I feel about that. Megan stopped by, too, but that was to give Adrian some book of stuff she had written, and she told him to let no other touch it, so I didn't touch it. Hell, I didn't even think about touching it. I saw the look in her eyes. *shrug* the way I see it, if she wants me to know, she'll tell me.

Speaking of Mary, I have to email her and see what the fuck is going on with her being all buddy-buddy lately. Its just weird.

Sunday, we played DnD, and I created Fayde the Splatterer. He is a veritable killing machine. My new favorite character.

Monday I got to service a high pressure pump, and because of that, I got to go to my math class all greasy. It was awesome.

Today was......well, kinda boring.

Descartes was a fucking genius, though. So was Hobbes."

Which will be remedied next weekend, as we got multi-track recording up and operational. Which is fucking badass.

anyway, update. So I just got home from an awesome show at Bernie's. For those of you that don't know, Bernie's is a bar/rock club in downtown Columbus, and they have live music pretty much every night. Well, tonight, Adrian, Nathan, and I went and saw The Navies and A Day in Black and White. Good stuff. The Navies fucking owned. They played at like a million miles per hour. Good stuff. www.level-plane.com if you're curious.

Thats it for now. I need to shower then go to bed, because I have to work tomorrow."

So I got called off of work today, and I got to spend the day cleaning my room. Really, that means watching Aqua Teen, but whatever. Aside of that, things are going alright. More or less. I need a new fucking job, though. My current one won't pay the bills. Not if I move out, anyway, which is the current plan for this summer. We'll see what happens.

Okay, boring crappy update, but I really don't feel like delving into emotional bullshit, because, lets face it, that shit just passes, anyway. Nothing worthwhile there.

Although I just thought of something. I need to change my shower schedule back to mornings. Which is kind of irritating, although I probably don't, really. We'll see."

He and I spent 10 hours yesterday working on the studio. I didn't say a word. Granted, there was a lot of nerdy euphoria, and uncapped sharpies, but still. Whatever.

I also learned something interesting, but I prefer to keep it private. If you don't like that, fuck you.

If you don't like what I just said, fuck you again.

Yes, I'm in that kind of mood right now. If you don't like it, go fuck yourself with a foot long razor blade.

I don't know why I'm in this horrible fucking mood, I had a fairly good day, I even made good progress in the sidequests in FFX. I just fucking am.

Whatever. It doesn't fucking matter, anyway. Fuck it.

"event","So, the Battle of the Bands was awesome. We didn't mess up or anything. I guess the crowd really liked us, too. We got second place, even. Seeing as it was really a compition for second place, Awkward Silence being the best band there hands down, we pretty much won. ^.^ We're really happy about that. I heard something interesting too. I guess people couldn't figure out what I was on stage for, and then when In a Pendulm's Swing just tore into the heavy bit, and I started screaming, they really liked it. Which is awesome. I'm just happy we did so well. It was so much fun. There were some other really badass bands, there, too. And some really shitty ones. Fucking Shattered Existance. I really don't like them. They got third place, and I guess they were pissed. Nathan went to go congradulate them on getting third, and he heard them saying ""Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!"" so he walked away. *shrug* The suck. I haven't watched the video of our show yet, but I will tomorrow.

For those of you that didn't make it to this show, we're play again on April 9th, call me if you want to come, and we're going to host the Second Annual Not-Quite- Woodstock at Nathan's place after MHS graduation, so you can come to that. ^.^

Well, I'm tired and sore, so I'm going to hit the shower, and then go to bed. I have to work tomorrow."

I'm in love with music. Not just like I like it a lot. I am literally in love with it. I'm in love with listening to it, with the emotion of it, with making it.

"event","I love some of my professors so much right now that I want to write odes in their names. My hilarious art history professor (he talks like a good New Yorker article and occasionally mocks himself for his own pretentiousness) just sort of flippantly extended the deadline of our research paper on the last day of class, when I had been planning to ask him for an extension anyway. And now my Russian Modernists prof sent us an email giving an extra day for the take-home final, which made me laugh, because I had already had every intention of turning it in a day late. But now he will never know. It's like they're responding to my every whim without me having to say a word. I wish this happened more often.

I have five days left of college academics, and I want to pause my 564 hour marathon of bad essay writing to reflect on what I have accomplished this semester. And by this, I mean that I want to create a gigantic tally of all the work I have done, so that I can impress myself and others with the sheer bulk of it. I'm including the things that I'll be working on this week, because if I don't finish them, I won't graduate, so their completion is pretty assured.

__________________________________________________

For my classes in the past few months, I have:

- written 100 pages of essays (20 of them in German or French)

- translated 43 pages of French

- read 37 books (not including research)
__________________________________________________

This is sick and wrong, and I firmly believe that it has actually left me mentally impaired in some way. I think it will take me a very long time to become human again after May 28. My ability to think creatively has been squeezed with such pressure into a little corner of my mind that it is now like a little lead pellet in danger of falling out my ear while I sleep at night. I realized about five minutes ago, while reading through a couple of sophomore year essays, that I do not actually write better than I did then. In fact, though my papers had improved slightly by last spring, they immediately began getting progressively worse after that, and the T. S. Eliot essay I finished this weekend is so stilted and tediously worded that I sound like I am not a native English speaker. See, even the sentences I just wrote in here are terrible. Look at the placement of those commas: they just snip right through the thoughts like a series of coughs in the middle of a boring lecture.

So, basically, I do not even have the mental energy to be excited about graduation, but I am distantly aware that I will be excited in the future, and I look forward to the time when that is possible. I want to write well again, and I want to do <i>real</i> writing, instead of page upon page of pretending to care about things I am only mildly interested in. I want to read widely and have time to actually think about what I'm reading. I want to stop gauging my self-worth by my successes within the Vassar bubble. I want to have a life again, a real life. I want to go back to Boston. I want to have an income, and be able to buy things besides food. I have only bought one new cd this year, and my mom lost it; last year I believe I bought two. Most of my cds have remained in cardboard boxes on the floor this year anyway, because one of the racks wouldn't fit in the car this fall, and I haven't been able to afford to buy a new one. Half of my clothes are falling apart, and my only ""nice"" shoes are so scuffed that if I ever get a job interview, I will look like a bum. I am a bum. I probably appear to most people at Vassar like I dress very nicely most of the time, but the main reason I've been wearing skirts almost every day is because I only own two pairs of pants, one of which has inexplicably shrunk in the wash (though never in the dryer, they slowly became shorter and shorter, and I certainly haven't had a growth spurt). I don't like being a bum. It's not so much all the things themselves I miss, but the freedom to keep my life from going to hell. So right now, as I go back to apathetically droning on about something or other on my computer screen, I want to keep that freedom dangled in front of me like a Jolly Rancher on a fishing pole, so that maybe I will have the motivation to finish this stupid week."

"event","According to today's <i>Times</i>, a guy bought his wife the entire library of Penguin classics, over a thousand books. I want a husband like that.

There is maybe some irony in the way I've been singing ""Life is wonderful"" all through a night during which I spent a lot of time not writing a paper and getting only an hour and fifteen minutes of sleep. But it's beautiful this morning, and I'm oddly content, though I still have three pages to write.

I decided, during my night of educational unproductivity, that I want a website. I also decided that the reason I don't like my livejournal identity is because I started this soon after graduating from high school, and something in me feels obligated to stay true to the way I talked and wrote back in high school. So I end up with this curiously regressive way of writing in here, in which I try to pretend everything is the same as it was three years ago. I maybe need to move on from the emerald elf. And thus, website. Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea how to make one. So this is probably not going to exist any time in the near future. Christmas break project, maybe? If it's posh enough, I could post some stories on it and put it on my resume, and join the 21st century of more technology-savvy job-seekers. Or I could just stop thinking about all of this and write my damn english paper already.

Or not. I rapidly alternate these days between counting down the seconds til graduation, when I will be able to escape the stiflingness of this campus and have a life again and read all the non-school books I want and lose my heightened Vassar self-consciousness, and then feeling that there is a particular quiet kind of happiness here that I will miss. Not a bold, secure, social happiness, but beauty and intelligence and interestingness and this one shared identity which drives me crazy sometimes, but which it is also comforting to be a part of. 

I am...going to write more essay. I need to become enthused about what I'm writing, because I feel like not finishing it through sheer lack of motivation. That would be bad."

"event","I'm doing well. So well, in fact, that I would like to disassociate myself entirely from the stupid girl who was writing in my livejournal last year. I feel like I ought to go through and privitize all of the entries I dislike, so I don't go around making bad impressions on all the wandering strangers of the internet, but really I'm far too lazy for that. So can we pretend they don't exist? Thank you kindly.

I'm treating this as my first year at Vassar, because last year, I was neurotic beyond belief. So I'm making grand efforts to talk to people and smile at their faces rather than at my feet, and nobody (except maybe my thesis advisor, in a metaphorical sort of way) has smacked me yet for such impudence. Huzzah.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way.

I'm translating Madame D'Aulnoy's ""La Chatte Blanche"" for my thesis. Somehow, when I first looked at it, I thought it was 30 pages long, but since then it has managed to grow to 37 pages, which is rather dispiriting. It's like an everlasting gobstopper. I really like translating and am even daring to believe that I'm sort of good at it, but I'm supposed to be giving the first draft to my french teacher next weekend to read over October break, and I am approximately halfway through. At a rate of about an hour and twenty minutes per page, slower for any particularly tricky sections, this means that I am going to be eating, sleeping, and breathing little Blanchette and her dearly devoted prince for the next week. 

What's worse, though, is that since my thesis advisor can't actually help me with the translation, she seems to regard it as some minor incidental thing at the end of my to-do list. I told her last week that I had made plans with my french prof. for him to go through it, and she was like ""oh, well, now that you've got that all squared away, I'd like you to write a couple of pages on the introduction for Wednesday..."" I was like, ""squared away??!! I have 20 pages of translating to do in a week and a half!"" We make a bad pair. She doesn't think I've done any work unless I explicitly talk about all of it, and I, shockingly, am not very talkative. This translation, for her, is some fuzzy, insubstantial thing floating out of the realm of her vision, and I almost want to bring in my stack of papers, with its mess of crossed-out lines and corrections, and read it out loud to her, stopping to discuss every section I had problems with. At the end of this seven hour storytime, maybe she'd finally get it. After every meeting with her, my face is sore from smiling insincerely for forty-five minutes.

Various other things from my life right now:

- I hurt my knee running a few weeks ago, and when it was starting to get better, I immediately went on five mile runs three days in a row. This sensible action not only hurt my knee worse, but also screwed up my hip. Go me. Now I'm trying to lift weights on a regular basis, as my leg muscles have begun annoyingly disappearing. Weights are not as fun as running, and I'm sore.

- I read <i>Tithe</i>, by Holly Black, this weekend, and it was so fabulous that I'm still in a good mood.

- I got the new Fiona Apple cd today! And haven't listened to it yet! What's up with that?

- I'm going to bed earlier tonight than any Sunday thus far this year. Right now. Ironically, I'm looking forward to this (comparitively) huge sleep session so much that I don't want to go to bed. Does that even make sense? I'm so excited by the prospect of sleep that I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep.

Good night."

They give the impression that it's worse at Vassar than it is at other places, which is untrue; it's much better here. They make it appear like it's a problem with our school, when it's really just an issue they have with the population at large; since they are currently living at Vassar, this just happens to be where they direct their complaints and annoyance. But the prospie doesn't know this. When deciding between colleges, you're wary of any evidence of negativity. So grr. Drop the agendas, everyone.

I have had 1 1/2 hours of sleep in the past 41 hour period. That's two back-to-back all-nighters with a short nap in between. For some reason, I'm still sane and functioning pretty well, which is actually baffling me. Be done, you little wretch of an essay!

Galway is so tiny and isolated. Nobody goes there. And it's strange to think of life continuing in the city without me, although I know that's stupid.

"event","I just want to make a note of this day for myself. I've been kind of...turned upside down this year, repressedly bitter at all people who seemed so much more well-adjusted than me, feeling like all the talents I had counted on til this point had suddenly vanished and left me stranded, confused about my real priorities and feeling like I've spent so long ""selling myself"" on applications that I didn't really know what I meant anymore....

And I'm not miraculously cured of all this, but I am at peace right now. Vassar does have extremely odd dynamics, and I still feel it tugging me around disorientingly, but I'm not letting it totally control me.

I never want to go through the adjustment period of a ""freshman year"" ever again. Because that's totally what this was, and I can't understand myself: the way I seek out change in my life and then react so horribly to it. I treat every difference of environment as a full-blown identity crisis, like I can't make small, slow adjustments, but instead must dig in my fingernails and peel off another layer of skin.

"event","So I was thinking at work yesterday that <i>War and Peace</i> is going to be the first book of my summer reading. It will take a big satisfying <i>thwack</i> at the remaining strings of school stress by stating, in very emphatic capital letters, ""I HAVE ENOUGH FREE TIME TO READ 1,500 PAGES. TAKE THAT, VASSAR."" I will also, then, be able to cross it off the list of things I want to accomplish in my life. There aren't very many books that make it to the level of ""accomplishments."" Proust's <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> is really the only other one I can think of, but that's kind of like the Swiss Alps next to a bunch of anthills. Especially because my maniacal goal is to read all seven volumes in french. Oh, one day.

But I'm getting off-topic. The thought of this first elusive book of freedom, along with various other plans, has begun sustaining me in my black hole of homework madness (I mentioned ""finishing the English paper"" very incidentally before...well, it's quite real, and it's roaring). Then this morning, I found an article about the popular books on summer reading lists (Harry Potter, Da Vinci Code, of course, etc.) and the last paragraph said (this is going to seem totally anticlimactic now):

<i>""There are some people who will never read light in the summer, you can count on it,"" said Carol Schneider, a Random House vice president. ""They will read their 'War and Peace' even at the beach, so you have to accommodate everyone.</i>

I couldn't remember all 200 works we'd looked at, and I certainly couldn't remember the names of all the artists, and I hadn't even finished all the reading, and I was already sure that I'd failed my paper because <i>it had no thesis statement</i>. So I was panicking, and thinking, hopefully a C? Will I get a D in this class? Should I even bother going to the exam? But of course, no. I did not suffer at all for lack of studying, only for lack of ability to write quickly, and lack of brain power due to my near all-nighter. And I got a B on the paper, despite its glaring lateness. And, you know, I'll probably get a B on that exam. And, really, life is okay.

I did not like the class, I don't care about the subject, and after this essay I will never need to think about it again. So why do I take this to heart so much? When the insensitivity of her response was unjustified, and when the entire thing is irrelevant to my life? How can I view myself as an independent person when my feelings are completely dependent on any chance comment that somebody makes to me? It doesn't matter who the person is; I will take it overly seriously whether or not I respect his/her beliefs in general. I am hurt indiscriminately.

A guy in my german class, who worked with me on this last skit, is Japanese. I brought in a pair of my shoes to use as props for our skit, and they had something written on them in Japanese, so he told me what it said. The gist was (oy! my memory...): ""we're sitting in the tea room and you're sneering at me, but I can't stop smiling and bursting into laughter."" Generally, when clothes have asian characters on them, it's something inane and hippieish, like ""love"" or ""peace."" I thought this was really awesome, and I made him repeat it twice, but I still can't remember exactly what he said. It makes me smile to know that my shoes have this queer little vignette written on them."

"event","I'm going to miss my german class! It was like a little family, and we all suffered through the daily nine o'clocks together.

In the face of this tragedy, and to combat essay stress, I'm going to list some happy things from the past few days:

1. French is done. We have an exam on the 17th, but it requires no studying, so it doesn't count. No more long, tedious classes. FINI.

2. When I went to cash my paycheck Friday, it was sunny and warm so I took a walk around Poughkeepsie. Behind the ugly Main Street, I discovered some pretty hills with a couple of large, old-looking churches. A couple of little girls were sitting on the sidewalk in front of their house (same style as the three-story pastel-colored ones in my Boston neighborhood) selling a pile of flowers that they'd picked off the bushes next to them. I bought three rhododendrons for a quarter, and they yelled <i>thank you</i> after me over and over. I felt a little silly carrying the flowers around as I walked beside a busy highway, but I had this silly grin on my face anyway.

3. I found Jon Wynes (remember? cross country?) on facebook and friended him. Hee.

4. I'VE BEEN RUNNING for two weeks, and I'm okay so far. I can't even express how big this is to me, so I won't try. Just hope, please, that my back doesn't try to cripple me again.

5. The guy I've sat next to in german all year, who I've kind of been kicking myself for not getting to know better, is not only taking german again next year, which practically no one else in the class is, but he is doing the summer program in Germany and will be in the same class as me. I'm very happy about this, because he's a nice guy (with an enviable skill for memorizing vocab), and I get the chance to be slightly more outgoing than I've been this year.

6. My art history paper is done and turned in. Late, but no longer a worry.

7. Free pizza at our german theaterabend today, so I didn't have to buy dinner! Which is very fortunate, since I have no points left!

8. German barbeque tomorrow, so free dinner again! Thank you, vassar german department. Without you, I would starve.

C'est la fin du list. Aber vielleicht mehr morgan. The end of this semester is much less stressful than the end of the last one. This is partially because I realize now that I was making too big a deal of everything, but also because I just have less work. All I have left is two (maybe three?) papers, one exam to study for, and reading <i>King Lear</i> for tomorrow, which I can skimp on if I run out of time, because I remember it pretty well."

In other news, I looked myself up on Google and found old Crim and Volkslaufe results and also <a href=""http://www.dexterannarborrun.com/results/97_5k_oa.htm"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, which is funny for two reasons: 1) I have no memory of running in that, and 2) a Uhazie came in soon after me - I wonder if she's related to Tracy? There's also <a href=""http://www.runmichigan.com/results/97/firstofamerica5k97.html"" target=""_blank"">this</a>, which I also have no memory of running. Did I have some sneaky twin rushing around and doing races for me in '97? Weird. This is truly a momentous discovery, and I'm happy that I use my time in such productive ways. Also, with my new and extensive German knowledge, I now know that Volkslaufe means ""people's run."" Which is not terribly surprising or enlightening, but there you have it.

Stay tuned for more exciting and inspirational end-of-semester updates."

"event","It's funny: liberal arts colleges are usually considered liberal (and, politically, they usually are) but the idea of a liberal arts education is actually very conservative. Vassar's classes are academically traditionalist, particularly the English department; the whole system is intended to familiarize students with The Cannon, all the giant thinkers of past and recent present. It emphasizes education in the art gallery style: you respectfully stand in a group, peer at masterpieces through glass, and then critically discuss them.

I've been thinking about this because I keep musing on the differences between Emerson and Vassar classes, their relative merits and guiding principles. One thing I've learned from experiencing two entirely different academic environments is that ""getting an education"" is not such a solid idea. I'm not starting on some nostalgic, regretful tirade here: Vassar is still a much better school than Emerson. But while I've certainly gotten a lot of <i>knowledge</i> out of my classes here, Emerson gave me a way of looking at the world creatively instead of critically. Vassar can overacademicalize (that'll make it in the dictionary one day, I swear) things, taking the angle of ""how to dissect the text"" more than ""how to be inspired by the text."" I'm afraid I often lose sight of why I'm learning things here. Professors will make me care about them within a Vassar context, but I have a harder time internalizing it. That's partially just the sheer amount of reading I have here - I end up mechanically chugging through it (or intending to), without the time to sit and ponder it afterward. 

What I'm trying to say is: I often feel like I get creatively squashed by Vassar's weighty academic brick. I become too serious. I forget sometimes that the reason I study literature and art is simply because I like interesting stories and pretty things. It baffles me how people can get pretentious about subjects that are essentially the study of make-believe and imagination. I sort of miss going to an artsy school. But I like that it's more intelligent here. I just want it to be summer so I can get started on the painting that I made a little thumbnail sketch of today while I was supposed to be working on my art history paper. I want to be back in the city, because it reminds me that the world is a big, interesting place, and that's why I want to write about it. My mind is confined to a space the size of my dorm room right now, and I can't think beyond the messy and demanding pile of notebooks in the corner."

"event","The Rochester Hills Public Library got rid of two of my favorite books ever! Why???? One is a Jenny Nimmo book, which they still have the sequel to - and for some reason they thought it made sense to buy four of her new books and get rid of one of her older ones. If her books are good enough to continue buying, wouldn't they want to keep all of them? And the other one is an Alexander Key which is out of print, like all but one of his other books. It's impossible to find, and they threw it out. Or, you know, sold it to some ungrateful person who is not me. Damn them. YA authors get no respect and it drives me nuts."

"event","Slight amendment: medieval lit. might be interesting next fall, because the topic is the Gawain poet (King Arthur stories), and the prof. is supposed to be good. Some person on ratemyprofessor said he was his/her inspiration for becoming a teacher. Which sounds promising. I might possibly take two English classes next spring, modernism or something else I like as a seminar, which would free me up to take my pre-1900 requirement at the 200-level, so I could take 18th century novels or something.

None of this makes me hate the English department any less. But I'm trying to make things not suck so much."

"event","Vassar, you make me hate being an English major. You are in danger of making me hate literature altogether. You suck the life out of the one thing that is most important to me by forcing me to read dozens of boring texts and not allowing me to read any <i>novels</i> or <i>stories</i> or pretty <i>poems</i>. I did not become an English major to read sermons or essays or sonnets. It is now settled: I cannot take a single interesting English class the entire time I'm here. In fact, I have to take a bunch of 300-level classes that I find more painfully tedious than any other subject besides, probably, statistics. I don't want to take Milton next spring, but IT'S THE ONLY PRE-1900 SEMINAR YOU'RE OFFERING! WHY?! WHY DON'T YOU HAVE SHAKESPEARE AT THE 300 LEVEL??? I DON'T WANT TO READ MILTON <i>EVER</i>, LET ALONE FOR AN ENTIRE SEMESTER!

And I can't take Nabokov, because it overlaps with German, when I was so excited about it...And I can't take philosophy, because my stupid English seminar is hogging the space in my fall schedule. But I'm going to ask if I can audit it. Even though I promised myself that I would cut back on that next year so I don't overextend myself while writing my thesis. But of course I will anyway.

What really sucks is that I already took two 300-level classes before I came here, but Vassar is snobbish about transfer credits and they only count them as 200-level. So they don't count toward the major requirements.

Some people took all the shower curtains out of the bathrooms (in every dorm) this morning. I'm glad I brought that large blue towel back from home, because my other towels would have been too small to cover the door, and I would have been dirty and miserable. As is, I am amused. But I was very <i>un</i>amused at 8:15 this morning. Happy April Fool's Day, tout le monde."

I have resolved to read at least a half hour of a good book every day to keep school from driving me insane. I hate Renaissance Lit. I mostly despise my french class. I am slightly intimidated by my philosophy class, even though it's amazing. The other two are fun. Altogether, my classes are far too much work, and I am counting the days til summer."

My second list looks so much shorter. But it's NOT. Oh, all the pages...Somehow I feel less stressed out than I did before, though, just because there are less total things to worry about.

Neither the English nor the philosophy has a specific turn-in time. I'm able to drop them off as long as I can get into the buildings. So...I see this going on until Saturday morning.

"event","God, the snow is beautiful. There wasn't much on the ground when I went in the retreat to talk to someone about an English class thing, then I walked out an hour and a half later and the whole world had marshmallowed in whiteness. They're the wonderful huge, wet flakes, and they coated my hair and clumped on my eyelashes within a minute. I stumbled through the drifts back to my room, then ran out again with my camera to take pictures and grinned stupidly at everyone I passed. I took about 30 pictures. Some will turn out badly because my camera doesn't like the glare of lights at night, some will turn out badly because snow flakes got on the camera and made little translucent circles on the pictures, and some will turn out badly because I'm not very good at keeping my hands still. But hopefully a few will turn out!"

"event","I got my new earmuffs! They are warm and beautiful and I never want to take them off. I also got my <i>Chronicles of Narnia</i> boxed set! However, the person who sent me the books packed them in this bag/envelope thing for some impractical reason, and the corners and edges of the box are all crushed. What's up with that? The whole point in getting the books all together in a boxed set is because it looks pretty, and mine doesn't look so pretty anymore. It was from a B&N used seller, and I don't think they let me give feedback.

I napped for about four hours today, and my head still feels like it's filled with cotton balls. I have a freaking lot of homework tonight, and all I want to do is fall back asleep with my earmuffs on."

"event","I thought this poem beautifully articulated what I was saying a couple of days ago. It's called ""Goodbye"":

Goodbye, goodbye, to one place or another,
to every mouth, to every sorrow,
to the insolent moon, to weeks
which wound in the days and disappeared,
goodbye to this voice and that one stained
with amaranth, and goodbye
to the usual bed and plate,
to the twilit setting of all goodbyes,
to the chair that is part of the same twilight,
to the way made by my shoes.

I spread myself, no question;
I turned over whole lives,
changed skins, lamps, and hates,
it was something I had to do,
not by law or whim,
more of a chain reaction;
each new journey enchained me;
I took pleasure in place, in all places.

And, newly arrived, I promptly said goodbye
with still newborn tenderness
as if the bread were to open and suddenly
flee from the world of the table.
So I left behind all languages,
repeated goodbyes like an old door,
changed cinemas, reasons, and tombs,
left everywhere for somewhere else;
I went on being, and being always
half undone with joy,
a bridegroom among sadnesses,
never knowing how or when,
ready to return, never returning.

It's well known that he who returns never left,
so I traced and retraced my life,
changing clothes and planets,
growing used to the company,
to the great whirl of exile,
to the great solitude of bells tolling."

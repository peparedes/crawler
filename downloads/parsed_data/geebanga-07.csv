"event","okay..i am back
and im tired as a fuk
but i had a hell good time and im going to tell you all about it
okay..
our accommodation=shit..we stayed at melbourne uni..there were two beds, well actually one bed and a trundle peice of shit..aaaand i got that fuker, but slept like an angel...and apparently went crazy and shouted!...hahaha...there was a mirror, a basin and a fridge. THAT WAS IT
okay, first game vs fiji...they.were.crap..and didnt shave under their arms..we beat them by over 100pts..good first game..to get the nerves away.
second and third game were on the same day..vs the two hardest teams in our pool..A.C.T (canberra) and NSW
NSW- fair good game..they were big...reeeaaaal big, BUT, we were better..and got the win..that was a relief, but we had to get focused for our next game which we knew would be tough
ACT- we had a shit house start, which made it really hard to get back in the game..but we worked our assed off and got back infront.  we actually got infront by about 15 at one stage..then we let the fukers back in didnt we...FUK. anyway..they scores were really tight and eventually were level.  there was 4 seconds left and it was there ball.  they kicked it to their best player and she fukin did a step through from the fouline and scored on the BUZZER..and we lose..on the buzzer..by two..cunt
on wednesday all the states and shit had to go to Sovereign Hill (some tourist attraction)..it.was.crap..what a waste of the day. the only good thing about that day was going to the lolly shop and playing hacky sac..(hacky sac was our only form of entertainment all week)
thursday vs CHINA-what.a.game.
seriously..im gonna write this in capitals so you dont go passed it coz it was a fukin good game
WE PLAYED LIKE A PIECE OF SHIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER..WELL NOT THAT BAD BUT FUK CHINA'S SHOOTING FROM THE 3 PT LINE WAS FUKIN UNBELEIVABLE..IM NOT EVEN JOKING. IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD..FUK
WE WERE DOWN BY 30 IN THE FIRST QUARTER..YES 30..WELL 29 BUT 30 SOUNDS MORE DRAMATIC...AT HALF TIME WE WERE DOWN BY 25 POITNS.  WE ALL KNEW THAT IF WE LOST THIS GAME BY MORE THAT 12 POINTS WE WOULD HAVE TO CROSS OVER AGAINST VICTORIA..AND THAT WAS NOT GOOD
SO FUK ME STUPID IF YOU WERE EVER TO WATCH A GAME OF BASKETBALL THIS SECOND HALF WOULDVE BEEN THE ONE.  WE FUKIN WORKED OUR MOTHER FUKIN ASSES OFF AND PLAYED SOME DAMN FUKIN GOOD DEFENCE AND KEPT GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER.  FINALLY WE WERE DOWN BY ABOUT 10 WITH SAY 3 MINUTES TO GO..BUT WE WERE LIKE, 'HEY, WE CAN ACTUALLY WIN THIS..FUK LOSING BY LESS THAN 12..LETS FUKIN WIN'
AND GOOD LORD WE DID
WE SET A FULL COURT TRAP AND GOT HEAPS OF STEALS...THEN WE WERE DOWN BY ONE..ONE FUKIN POINT..WE CAME DOWN AND DID OUR OFFENCE..WE PLAYED ALOMOST OUR FULL 24 SECONDS BUT COULNDT SCORE..THE BALL WENT OUT OF COURT TOUCHED LAST BY CHINA, SO IT WAS OUR BALL.  BUT THE BUZZER WENT OFF.  WE ALL COMPLAINED COZ THERE WAS STILL ONE SECOND LEFT.  SO OUR COACH CALLED A TIME OUTT.. IT WAS OUR BASELINE BALL WITH ONE MOTHER FUKIN SECOND TO GO.  
THE PLAY WAS TO PASS IT TO OUR TWO BIGS WHO WERE SEALING INSIDE THE KEY.  I WAS PASSING IT IN AND THE OTHER TWO GIRLS WERE LOOKING FOR A SHOT OUTSIDE.  
THE UMPIRE GAVE ME THE BALL AND IT WAS ON BIATCHE.  I COULDNT GET THE BALL IN TO OUR BIGS SO THE OTHER GUARD KATE CAME AROUND AND SHE WAS OPEN..I GAVE HER THE FUKIN BALL AND SHE SHOT IT STRAIGHT AWAY..AND IT.FUKIN.WENT.IT
FUUUKKKK YEEEEAAHHHH
WE WENT NUTS..LIKE FUKIN CRAZY..WHO WOULDVE THOUGHT THAT A TEAM 29 POINTS DOWN COULD WIN
HAHAH WELL FUK U ALL COZ WE DID!!!
aahhh..well now thats out of my system..then next games
quarter final vs tasmania..fair easy game and beat them by about 30
semi final to play in the gold medal match vs Victoria...fuking good team. and we played crap..i played crap...seriously..crap..they set a full court trap and i was the one who had to fukin dribble through it aaaaand lets just say i didnt do to good a job of that
it was a crap game and we lost by 20 or so points..shit
so it was for a bronze medal
these games are shit because if you lose you dont get shit..but if you win..you get a medal...in the gold medal match..you are guaranteed a medal so we were disappointed we didnt win.
anyway my hands are hurting so to put it short..we beat QLD by three points it was close at the end but we were the better team and got the bronze baby!
so thats it my friends..my week in a nutshell
oi and ele i am going to do that ssp thing..i think we deserve it to the ssp program for all the shit they've done for us..so hopefully ill see you there.
okay niggas
peace out

but i was fuked as a fuker..i havent been sick in ages...so i was due
serioulsy..i think i have chronic fatigue..why am i so damn tired all the time?
anyway...
friday night-we played sturt..it was such a good effort..we had six players, and our best player, who scores like 25pts a game for us wasnt playin either. so a tough game ahead. anyway..we were heaps tight for 3 and a half quarters...
serioulsy..i was getting fukin raped..and not gettin shit called by the refs..even my coach was going nuts...
so in about the 2 quarter..i fukin whacked my head...AGAIN..fuk
it hurt...it really hurt..and i was pissed off..so i was even more upset...so then..i got pissed off and angry coz i was playin shit..and gettin nothin from the refs...
but you see it sucks...if i play shit....im not gonna go around yelling, screaming ooo look at me im playing shit isnt that great!
no..im gonna be pissed off..im allowed to be right? i dont get pissed off too often..not to this extent anyway
so what sux is that if i drop my head...so does the whole fukin team...and its not fair..i fukin hate pressure..and im not strong enough to carry the whole fukin team...(i dont mean that literally..fukers)
and i dont want to sound cocky...coz i swear...i fukin hate that shit...and if i ever am...shoot me in the head..twice...with a cannon
okay, so now thats out the way..
so its not fair..if im having a shit game..the team needs to lift...and thats what usually happens..when somebody plays shit, the team steps up a level..not lately anyway...
its like just because i went to state, they have to do eveyrthing i do....HELLOOOOO..I GOT FUKIN 10 SECONDS A GAME!!!
im just the same as you fukers...and fuk...this new chick im my team wont even talk to me...wtf?!?! she apparently thinks im fukin scary! NOOOOOOO

"event","aaaaaalrite..so i know you have all been waiting for me to update
so there you go
im off

hahaha not really
aaaalrite..ill start from my game last sunday...
Game Vs Mavs -this means playing against kayla..which means bit of a toughie..alrite, so we started ok...pretty slow actually..kayla kicked our asses at the start...but then we adapted..you know..got her figured out..
so theres like 2 minutes to go..we're down by 2..kayls has 3 fouls...there point guard (who by the way is fukin fast and fukin good)has three fouls also..
so me, being the smartest fuker around..decide that im going to get this guard on her forth foul...and when im determined to do something on that court...i tell u what, its gonna happen...so this guard..she dribbling down the floor..(i knew she would cross it over and not go onside) so i prepared myself for a crossover right..she dribbling...im defending...knowing that im going to get it off of her...
so she crosses over, just like i expected..so i fukin got across..pulled her up good..she pushed me back right..so then she crossed over again..and i was like, fuker...im gonna get u again...so i sprinted my fukin ass off and got in front of her again right... this is right on the sideline..so she's fuked anyway..and i turned her and pulled her up..it shouldve been a charge coz she fukin pushed me..but i diditn even care...so i was waiting for it right...that cross over...and she did it..golden opportunity..i fukin stuck out my hand and i stole that fuker of a ball..we're still on the sideline right..so i tried to keep in in..and i did..but the dumb fuker fouled me...
Alice Gee = 1
Other point guard =0
so she's got her forth foul and she cant fukin foul no more...my coach..she yelled out to me
""Great Defence Alice Gee, Great Defence""
i know most of you wont give a fuk about what i just rote..but fukin hell..the feelin when i got her that foul, when i was working my ass off..when my coach yelled at me..it was fukin awesome..fukin awesome..and my coach dont ever say my last name..so i knew..i knew that i fukin deserved that fuker to get her foul
so that, was why that fukin game was so damn good..
im sorry to waste your time if you got no idea..
but fuk man...that shit right there..thats why i play basketball..and that, is why i fukin love it so much..just to get that feeling..evemn once a game..that feeling..its fukin amazing
peace out

"event","you know, i cried last night...but the thing is, i dont cry..and it was the first time in a very long time that i did...and man..it hurts. people cry about such different things, and what one person is upset about, another wouldnt be. and thats why its so hard for people to understand what others go through.
of course, im over it, and of course, it was nothing compared to what some of you girls go through, and of course...it was a bout basketball.
so theres this weekend, the classics, in melbourne. and the whole team gets to go and have a fukin awesome time. seriously tho, think of it like this...
your with some of your best friends, in another state, like on a holiday, having a fukin awesome time mucking around with them. AND, your doing the one thing you love doing..for me, its basketball...for you it might be a weekend away with your best friends drinking alcohol, or reading, or fishing, or listening to music..or whatever it is that makes you feel good. and imagine that its been one of the crappest years of your life, and this one weekend was one of ONLY things you were looking forward to, and then..its taken away from you. gone..and theres nothing you can do about it..at all.
well i'll tell you something, if you dont understand...i can tell you right now that it fukin sucks..and it hurts..like a bitch."

"event","So I guess I will join all of you and begin using the livejournal once again.  

This new year has begun with the joyous continuation of last year where I have been exceedingly happy and slowly adjusting to my life back in Gulfport/New Orleans. My goals for this new year are all about having fun, reconnecting with friends and getting back in touch with my artistic self.  

My home life is amazing thanks to my boyfriend and I'm having a good time at work and my library card is being put to good use.  (Which reminds me, I have things to return tomorrow!!)

I wish that it was not quite so cold in the early morning and I could comfortably go on my walk, but I've been enjoying sleeping in and rolling around on the floor in the morning doing the merest semblance of yoga.  All that will sort itself out and I'm thinking of going to the Hip Hop dance class at Crescent Lotus on Saturdays.  I may look ridiculous doing the moves, but I think it will be a great deal of fun and it will get me out of the French Quarter on the weekend.

In exactly 2 weeks I will be 30 years old and while I was planning to have a huge party, I'm rethinking this plan.  January is a tough time to have a picnic and so maybe some small gatherings with people throughout the weekend will be the right speed.  That and a massage.  And dying all the gray out of my hair.

My birthday wish is that I get a smidgen more patience, some lovely musk perfume and I get to see some of my dearest friends. Cheers!"

I spent a great deal of time last night sifting through the over 15,000 songs on my external hard drive to create playlists for the cocktail hour and dancing portions of my brother's wedding.  I've come up with 3 1/2 hours worth of fun cocktail music and 8 hours of dancing music.  This is overkill for both...

I fell asleep before the fondue.  Not surprising since my internal clock is set for two hours later and I was up until 3am the night before.  I had a wonderful time at my soon to be sister-in-law's bachelorette party.  She's a very special person to me and I was thrilled that she invited me to celebrate with her and her closest friends. We started out the evening at home- quickly eating dinner and then changing into dresses and fancy shoes.  We then went to Martuni's which is a karaoke bar but with live piano.  Think: gay men singing show tunes.  It was fun meeting the other women at the party and I was paid a lovely complement on my shoes (as seen in the photo).

"event","I still have my last week of classes and then exam week ahead of me, but my trip to India has really taken a large part of my focus.  It has a great deal to do with the facts that I just finished the final formatting of our pre-trip book and I have to write a 10 page research paper about Management in India.  
	Besides all of the work, I'm really excited about the trip.  We were given copies of our itinerary today and it makes everything all the more real.  It is time to start taking the acidophilus, eating yogurt and upping my vitamin C.  Getting super healthy before going will surely be some help (not to mention all of the immunities I received through my time in New Orleans and Thailand.)
	While there are many things to take care of with the end of the semester and my approaching move (not to mention having to get the plans started for the fall in Italy) I'm feeling relaxed about it all. Now if only I could make it to yoga more often..."

This is due to a combination of studying and being stir crazy.  The later is due to my empty house as Xn is in New Orleans for Mardi Gras.  I do have to say I like having a few hours here and there in the house alone, but I miss his presence desperately.  A week from tomorrow we'll be meeting in Tampa for a nice vacation before returning to Dallas, having my first week of classes for Mod B and then leaving on Thursday evening to go to NOLA for a camping trip with friends.

Lots of motion and many things on my plate.  I have a wealth of things that I want to do and even when I have all of the time, it all seems to disappear into other activities.

Anyhow, it is off to bed so I can get up and go work at my internship.  We are having some nice older ladies coming in Tuesday and Wednesday to address the Gala invitations."

"event","I'm feeling domestic these days.  I bought a vacuum cleaner and scrubbed the bathroom.  After my shower I'll be doing a load of hand washing before bed.  Whee!!  

I made it to the monday yoga class finally.  One of my favorite teachers leads it and she let me know that the woman who teaches the 7:30am Monday and Wednesday class is considered one of the best teachers in the area.  If I managed to get myself up and ready and out of the house by 7:20am, I'd be amazed.

My trip to Denver was lovely and as always it was wonderful to spend time with my family, especially my siblings.  I'm looking forward to seeing them often this summer.  Also as I took my luggage out of the van at the airport, I asked my dad to forward me some info about new Customs regulations so I can keep up with the news.  I think he picked up on my ""don't you dare sell the business because unless some random outside opportunity presents itself I'm planning on moving back to NOLA to keep the business in the family"" subtext.

The downside of the trip was the deadly combination of Alcohol and Altitude.  Being born and raised below sea level in the flatlands buffered me from this evil that lurks in the mountains.  I must though stress that every glass of sublime whiskey served to me by the Master of Whiskey (he is in fact a Master of Whiskey in the same way a sommelier is to wine).  The aftereffects though were pretty terrible and we really had to do our best to pull ourselves together for the big family brunch the next morning."

Here is a list of things I've been doing (and how Texas is changing me):

-Yesterday I went to meet up with my girlfriends at a sportsbar to watch the game.

-I also went to yoga in the morning and took myself to the movies.  I saw Filth and Wisdom due to my love of Eugene ""Bitches and Ho's""* Hutz and I was curious about Madonna's directing skills.

-I've spent a lot of time at home, doing work, reading, cleaning, watching TV shows on my laptop.

-Xn was in town a couple of weeks ago and I am counting down until Thursday when I fly to NOLA for Halloween and get to see him, my family, my friends and my city.  I haven't been home since I came to Dallas in August.

-The entire 2010 MBA class went to a ropes course last weekend which was a lot of fun and I was very sore the next day.

-The other night the temperature in my house was 58 degrees which means it was a 2 cashmere sweater night.

Okay.  Now it is time for me to finish getting ready so I can go over to school to meet with people and do more homework.

*when I met Eugene Hutz outside of the Bulgarian dance club on the LES where he dj's we chatted and then he burst out yelling ""bitches and ho's"" over and over again.  It was one of the most memorable NY adventures Sam and I had.

The only reason I'm posting right now  is that I can't stand to look at my accounting or finance books anymore.

Once this week is done and these test are over, my boyfriend is arriving in town to spend a long weekend with me before I start my next set of classes on Monday.  No time off, but from what we've heard, next quarter is much easier.  Just the fact that we'll have one less class is joyous.

I realize that my apartment still feels empty.  I need a few more things to flesh it out and I must finish the framing that is left to do or else I just have a stack of art in a box and bare walls.  I'm hoping that Xn's presence here will help me motivate to do all of that.

I have such an urge to paint or draw, but such little focus.  My concentration is just shot and I have so many things on my to do lists that I can't quite get to any of it.

ah well.  I'm sure next week will feel totally different.

My other class- Intro to Arts Management is a joy.

I have my bike which is great.  It isn't as fancy/stylish as the one I was first intending to get but it is nice.  I don't have the fenders for it yet so I've not been riding to school as it has rained almost every day.  It is supposed to clear up this weekend.

"event","I'm back from Dallas and I am really tired.  I landed at the New Orleans airport at 10:30pm and went straight to work.  The best part about that was the unexpected surprise of Xn waiting for me outside of the Ritz employee entrance to see me for just a second before I rushed inside.

I found an apartment (thank you craigslist) that if nothing goes haywire with my background check, I'll be sending in my first month's rent very soon.  It is in a transitional neighborhood meaning that they are tearing down old apartment buildings and structures to put up luxury condos.  I will be living in a house built in 1939 with the original wood floors (which have just been sanded and re-varnished and the walls repainted.)  

I went to see the space when I arrived on Tuesday.  My initial though was that I like it but it seemed small.  After spending 4 hours with the real estate agent looking at a ton of properties, I went back Thursday afternoon with my mother and it looked a lot bigger.  It is somewhere around 750 square feet.  After standing in an apartment that was 491 square feet, I realized what a good sized space it is.  Also the location can't be beat.  I can ride a bike to school (and once I get to the west side of 75, there is a bike/running trail that ends a block or two away from campus.)

While in Dallas I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton and was pleasantly surprised when I saw they had upgraded me to the club level.  I spent two nights getting the service that I usually provide.  Mom and I luxuriated in the room, ate an amazing meal in the restaurant, and I had a good time talking to my Dallas counterparts.

On Wednesday evening there was a happy hour meet and greet for the students in my class.  I met quite a few of my classmates including the girl in my dual degree program who has a background in computer engineering and the girl who is probably the second tallest female in our class after me.  I had a few glasses of wine and talked until my throat was sore.  This was the thing that made me the most excited about starting school.

After the final look at the apartment and lunch with a family friend, Mom and I had quite a few hours to kill before going to the airport.  We went to the Dallas Museum of Art which was open late and had live music.  We looked at a few exhibits and then had a picnic along with many other folks on the front lawn with the food I had bought on my first day in town.  My mother and I drive each other crazy at times, but we have such great adventures.  I feel like I know my way around Dallas pretty well, not to say that I won't get lost, but my internal map is rapidly developing.  

Now after tonight, I have 5 nights at work, 1 night off and then I fly to Honduras.  Always moving.  And thanks to all of you for the luck you sent.  I feel very lucky."

"event","(post begun on Saturday night)
It has been a difficult week.  With the move, with the packing and unpacking, and also that I have been working everynight (tonight is the seventh in a row, and I don't have off until monday).

Today I managed to do everything I planned.  I did yoga before bed, I slept until I woke up at 4:30pm (even with the really loud sewerage truck outside. i told it that it would not conquer me and I would sleep through its noise).  Then I took a bath, Xn and I had dinner and went to the movies.

We saw The Fall.  A film done by Tarsem Singh who made The Cell (remember the really pretty film with Jennifer Lopez).  The Fall was lush, beautiful, and told a good story.  I see a lot of similarities between Singh's and Peter Greenaway's visual styles.

After the movie, we went back to my former apartment (which still has stuff I need to move out) and made dinner.

We've both been so busy and stressed that it seems as if we've had no time together.

Also this week my dear friend Caroline came in town for her birthday and we had a fabulous meal at Dick and Jenny's.  I highly recommend it.

(begin Sunday night transmission)
Today I took a walk with mom.  It is strange not seeing her nearly every day as I did when I lived across the hall.  I got home, did some stretching and went to be where I apparently slept through the loud truck today and didn't even know it was there until Xn asked me if it woke me up.  

We did some grocery shopping and went to the park.  Now usually we go to the park during the weekdays and so on this Sunday in summer, the park was full of people.  Not just enjoying the scenery but having parties, playing their radios loudly and there were a line of cars just cruisin' through.  We stayed maybe 15 minutes and then finished our grocery run.  

Back at home it was nap time.  I woke up first so I made dinner and we had a great evening of a good meal and then trading massages. (this is the kind of life I love.  I had it when I lived in NY with Samantha but usually those nights ended with watching a movie.  This night ended with me going to work.)

Now I'm at work for the 8th night in a row, but I have the next 2 nights off and I'm very excited.  I'm so excited I'm going to make a to do list and then study accounting."

  Well Xn and I finally saw our new home and it was not quite what we had expected but I think it will work out fine.  Our room is small, smaller than either of our current spaces, but with the french doors and the balcony, it will feel a lot larger...until winter.

  The balcony and the back patio are really the best spots.  The landings aren't too bad either.  The bathrooms are terribly small but in the end, it is a comfortable space and I'm looking forward to spending the summer there with Xn, Trevor and Kryss.

<b>school news:</b>
  I finally received my Financial Accounting & Business Math and Statistics study guides.  I have to pass online tests for each of these subjects before July 31st.  I still have to take Accounting and Statistics in school, but as I haven't taken a quantitative math class since high school I see the importance of these exams.

<b>relationship news:</b>
  I am so in love that I am constantly amazed by it.  I hit a point this evening where the thought of moving to Dallas just killed me.  And though we  both know that it is the best decision as far as my education, I don't want to move away from him.  Don't panic.  I'm still going to SMU to get my MBA.

<b>social news:</b>
  I am sorry that I have abandoned my social life.  I should be off from work this Friday and Saturday nights.  I plan on going out and seeing my friends.  I will be having a going away party in July.  Once I talk to the housemates and check with them, it may turn into a Housewarming/Bon Voyage party at the new house.  I'll keep you posted.

Today was pretty easygoing.  Afternoon at the coffee shop with Xn, working.  Evening sleeping as Xn worked some more.  In transit from Zotz to Xn's apartment, we got into a bit of a tiff.  In fact, as the frustration peaked, I actually pointed at him and spoke in a very loud and definitive voice. (I didn't yell, really).  Then things were over and all resolved. He took me in his arms as I was still upset and promised me that everything was allright.  And it is.  And then he laughed at me for pointing at him.

I wonder what I'll bring to Xn's place and what will be left in August when I go to Dallas.  That will become apparent in time.

Anyone want to come help me sort through my closets?"

we went to Baton Rouge for the weekend, firstly to transport the Troll to his Louisiana State Massage Therapist Licensing Oral Exam....or something like that.  It was a quick 20 minutes of here are some questions, write us a check.  

From there we went over to our Neil and Sheri's house and proceeded to lounge around and talk and laugh for two days.  The girls went to yoga on Saturday morning while the boys slept in and we all went to a birthday party that night.  I socialized, read the intro to a cookbook, proceeded to get drunk and ended up falling asleep on the couch which was really satisfying. 

At one point Neil said something to me about my husband.  I guess we all see the direction Xn and my relationship is going.  

My other favorite comment from the weekend was in a discussion about names, the Troll said he was going to name his children after french baked goods: baguette, croissant, napoleon, eclair....  

This upcoming week has much on the agenda, like packing and moving, but I realized that I really want to see the space we're moving into as Xn and I have not stepped foot inside our new home yet.

my manager at work contacted some of her associates at 2 hotels in Dallas and so there is a very good chance that I'll have a part time job for grad school.

Dallas- June 23-25

Exciting news.  I was asked today to be in the wedding party for my best friend Kevin.  There was a brief question as to whether I should wear a tux or a dress, but his fiancee said a dress.  So I'm on the hunt for a matte amethyst colored dress.  I'm so flattered."

(the perils of working from 11pm-7am)

So Maxwell, happy birthday to you.  You are still 8 years older than me and that won't change no matter how many birthdays you have.

I had a lovely time in Shreveport with my friend Caroline and her mother Ginger.  Ginger is going to help me find an apartment in Dallas as she loves Dallas and knows all the best and safest neighborhoods.  Once I get my financial aid info in, I'll have a clue as to how much I can spend on an apartment and I'll let her go and search out some places.

I was told this weekend that Dallas is the place of the $30,000 millionaire.  People will have fancy cars, label clothes, and swank apartments in the best parts of town but not be able to afford any of it.  I think that is dumb and will do my best to avoid these people.  I hate being in debt and I'll be in a a lot of it soon, but for my education (or my house) it is worth it.  For consumer goods and a flashy reputation- who cares.

My reunion with the boyfriend after my days away was lovely.  He spent the entire afternoon and evening with me and so tomorrow he will be chained to his computer working.  I will spend tomorrow cleaning my room, sorting through my refrigerator and maybe seeing some friends.  Or maybe I'll just sleep forever.

Oh and lastly, I spoke with my manager at work about my schedule in July because it seems that my part of the hotel is only closing for August.  She said not to worry.  My co-worker Amy will be moving into my position and I can work whenever i need to (and during the day if I want...) phew!

Milton, who sweeps and mops my part of the hotel, has been asking me a couple of words in English every night.  Tonight it was <i>radio</i> and he wanted to know what ""come back"" meant.  The fact that <i>radio</i> and radio are spelled the same but pronounced differently is a strange thing to wrap your mind around.

Today I was really tired so I napped most of the afternoon and I watched the film Fur (which I own on DVD) with the director commentary.  I think that they based their imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus on the really badly written biography I read in New York last year.  I have enjoyed watching films with the commentary because after you've seen something a couple of times, having the creative vision explained in real time gives depth.  Sometimes.  I have seen really boring director commentary where all they talked about was lighting angles and showed how they used the same set piece 40 different times.  What I also like is having actor commentary because film is such a strange medium in contrast to theater and there are so many takes and the actors never really see the work until it is all put together by the director and editor that sometimes they are seeing the work for almost the first time as they are commenting on it.

My life is both quiet and busy right now.  I'm still working overnight at the Ritz-Carlton.  I'm spending as much time with my boyfriend as I can and I'm trying not to get too anxious and worked up about the fact that I'm moving to Texas in 3 months.  (I have to find a place to live in Dallas and I kinda want a roommate as it will be cheaper but I hate apartment hunting.  Also I need to find out what my financial aid package is so I know about how much per month I have to spend on my living expenses.  Though I will probably try to find a job while I'm in school (and maybe a job at the Ritz-Carlton in Dallas) I do not want to take on too much.  My classes are compressed into quarters instead of semesters so it is a lot of information in a short period of time and I have to keep my grades high to maintain my fellowships.

The last few days have been wonderful.  I was off from work on Sunday and Monday nights, so on Sunday we began the birthday celebrations.  Out to see the Bingo Show at One Eyed Jacks and then wandering around the quarter after that.  We got back home and fell right to sleep and Monday was spent very quietly at home.  We did a few errands, but I was very tired so the boy cooked dinner, I took a nap and the rest of the evening was spent laying around, reading, talking, etc.  Though at 12:05am (As I am an impatient sort) I gave him his birthday gifts- kitchen knives.  He was very pleased with them and i hope it means that he will continue to cook for me.  (He did ask me to cook dinner one night this week as he will be very busy finishing up a work project and I have some ideas forming in my head...)

Today we woke at 2ish and went to the airport to pick up the boyfriend's drinking problem who flew in from LA, and then out to Oki Nago for a ""Buffecution"".  We and 11 of our friends came out and ate large amounts of chinese and japanese food and then went to Molly's to have some beverages before I had to run and go to work. 

I expect the boy to be in my apartment when I get off from work this morning.  If he's not, it probably means he's still celebrating and I'll meet him out, have a shot before bed and take him home.

There are ton of things that I have to do and knowing where I'm going to school gives me a bit more focus.  None of the looming overhead, now it is just the practical bits that are a lot easier for me to handle.

One of the primary changes that will be happening is the transition into a long distance relationship.  Dallas is not that far and considering the last time I had a long distance relationship, I was out of the country for 9 months, this is not so bad.  I don't have classes on Fridays.  I have long vacations.  It will be fine.  Now I just have to figure out how to get the boy to Italy while I'm in school there for Fall Semester 2009.

In preparation for business school, I have been given a list of books to read and I'll be receiving some CD's and books to learn/familiarize myself with statistics and accounting.  Luckily this can wait until after I take the Customs Brokers Exam.

So if anyone has good contacts in Dallas, knows of good places to eat/go out/etc., can find me a killer apartment, just let me know."

I was wearing a black dress, knee socks and heels.  I did not look like I belonged there.

Enough with the vagaries, here it goes:

I knew that I was accepted to Tulane's MBA program and given a scholarship that covered 25% of my tuition and fees.

SMU took forever to send me an acceptance and a financial aid offer (after made me show up in Dallas in person to interview with two people I had met with back in November) but tonight I got the full info that I was not only accepted into their dual degree (MA/MBA) program but I was also awarded $58,000 in scholarships. (some of the money came from the business school and some from the art school as the MA is in Arts Management.)  This means that SMU has given me aproximately a 56% scholarship.

So, at the moment, SMU will not only cost less but I'll get 2 degrees and spend a semester in Milan.

I'm going to go to Tulane and see if they'll up their offer as I would love to stay in New Orleans and not move again (and again and again).

At this point the name of the game is less debt.

I returned the phone calls I had missed, settled in with my book and spent some lovely time with Xn when he came over to fetch his jacket.  My room is now mostly clean (dishes are done) and I had cocktails with mom, soup at Bennichin for Whitney's birthday, and right after I finished my latte at Pravda, my phone rang and my manager asked if I could come in a bit early as she was alone (my co-worker called in sick).  So off to work and those overtime hours will pad my paycheck nicely.

It is a difficult task to turn a department store into a hotel not to mention three hotels in one.  So I walk people to the correct elevators, send them down and around and so far it has been painless.

I do plan on going out into the streets tomorrow.  I haven't worked on my costume at all so we shall see what arises from the trunk.  I figured that I'll do my outing early and crash out in the afternoon before I return to the Ritz.

at the moment, my life is beautiful.  I am blissfully happy in my relationship and though I go to Dallas this Thursday for my application interviews, I have a feeling that I'll be staying in New Orleans, going to Tulane and buying a little double to fix up.  I feel ready to put down some roots and not keep moving.  I love this city and i can see a future here with ease.  Dallas would be a stopover on my way to something else, which has its merits, and though it is still an option it is a less and less appealing one.

I got a phone call from a friend in Atlanta today saying he may be coming down to NOLA for an audition.  It is a busy week for me as I'll be in Texas and Mississippi but if he comes we'll have a good time running around together.  He's a fun one.

This afternoon I went over to my friend Rose's house.  Her house is one of those places that I adore but I don't have that aesthetic to create a space like it.  So I take bits and pieces and try to integrate them but as a whole the house is a place that I feel comfortable and welcome.

We'll have different schedules but I'll see her when she's going to work and I'm leaving, or something. One of the fun things about Jenny is that she's a trainer for the ultimate fitness type workout- 30 minutes once a week- and she's going to do a couple sessions with me so I can start. 

I did find out that I have a uniform, which makes things easier and I won't have to go suit shopping.  The uniform is a jacket and skirt in seersucker (brown stripes, not blue).  It's not pants so that's a relief, but its more white than I've worn in years.  At the end of the day, the best part is that I never have to wash it as the hotel takes care of all of its laundry in house.

Dominique and Finney stopped by last night to return the DVD they borrowed and with fruit for us to snack on.  Dom also brought this necklace she had for years, she found it at her grandmother's house when she was a teenager. It has strange symbols on it which she wanted me to see if I can figure out their meanings, but when she handed it to me, it was so heavy with energy that I couldn't touch it for very long.

Once that is in I have about a month to wait for the responses from both Tulane and SMU.  Both schools weigh evenly at the moment and so much of my decision will come down to admittance and money.

I am still working at Trashy Diva, but my hours and location may be changing soon as I should be finding out at the beginning of the week if the Ritz Carlton is hiring me.  If so I'll be going through their Orientation process within days of the turning of the year.  The job at the Ritz is an overnight concierge for their club rooms.  These are the 75 VIP rooms that have their own concierge and butler.  Swanky and it should also give me the chance, during my non-busy hours, to study for the Customs Brokers exam.  

Having just ended one relationship, I'm flirting with another though the hours of the Ritz job will really make dating difficult.

One of those days I'll be going to Gulfport to poke through my house to see if there is anything I want to bring back to NOLA (and bring stuff to Mississippi that I don't need in NOLA).  Saturday is the Halloween dance party at Todd & Whitney's house and if you want to come to a fun house party just let me know and I'll send the details.  

I've been doing a great job at getting to bed before 2am and making it to the gym.  Except on Thursdays where I tend to be out until dawn and miss the gym both on Friday and Saturday.

I really want to go to tomorrow's show at One Eyed Jacks.  it is some vaudeville troupe.  If I am good I'll go to work, go to yoga, go home, get ready and get to the show.  If not I may just go to bed."

"event","My bike (or should I clarify- my father's bike) was stolen tonight as I sat at PRAVDA drinking coffee and working on the magazine and my grad school application.  I had it locked with 2 locks but neither was a U lock as I hadn't gotten around to getting one yet.  I used to have one but Ksea left with it...

Anyhow, I'm bummed and telling my father was no picnic.  I was left a crappy bike in exchange but that doesn't satisfy much.  I'll file a police report in the morning but there is really nothing much to be done.  I have both locks that were snipped with a bolt cutter.  The whole thing is really upsetting and it makes me so sad.  

I have been paranoid about riding that bike the whole time I've had it and why I didn't just take it into the bar/coffee shop with me tonight, I'm not sure but it just puts one more stress on my head as if my debt to the credit card companies didn't do enough of that."

"event","So I had my interview at Trashy Diva today.  Candice realized that we had met before and so besides being friends with most of her staff, she and I hit it off and I should begin training this week.  It is perfect for me and I'll be busy for my first couple of weeks on the job as people are going on vacation.  I'll also be able to use the structure to get my studying and my essays done.

I got caught in the torrential downpour this afternoon while on my bike.  If we had left the cafe 10 minutes earlier we would have missed the storm, but instead my socks are soaked and my hair is kinda funky looking...."

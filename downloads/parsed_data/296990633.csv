"event","Today is our 5 year anniversary!  We went out to eat with our 2 year old to Do Do's Chicken! (Columbian food)  No, not romantic, but good food and great company.  We'll be celebrating next week by going dancing at the Victor Manuel concert.  This is the first time we've gone out dancing in over 2 years!!  Hope we can last past 10pm!  Hubby and I actually met at a club....sigh....we have known each other now for almost 10 years!  We dated about 4 years before we got engaged.  I wasn't too sure he was the one, so I had to test the waters a few times!!!  Just kidding baby!  I think we got married at the perfect time.  I was 24, he was 26, we both finished college, had decent jobs, we had dated, partied, and done all we wanted to do in our lives and we were ready to settle down.  There are still times where I catch myself staring at him and think how much I am still in love with him...as if I were 20 again and still dating him.  I think I may wear out the word ""I love you"" because I say it so often to him, he may think its just an automatic reaction, but I really do truly love him with all my heart...I would be lost without him...he really does 'complete me'!  I guess maybe I'll start saying ""as you wish"" just to change it up a bit.  You know you're still as much in love with someone as the day you met them when you can look at them....smile....and sigh....and it gives you a feeling of warmth inside just to know they're still in your life.

My husband is a wonderful father and friend.  He always is able to help me sort through my problems and gives me good advice as both a friend and a husband.  I couldn't imagine my world without him or my two little ones.  To see all their little expressions and idiosyncrasies that remind me so much of us...I'm awestruck...and that's what makes them so perfect in my eyes....and that's what is so sublime, is that we made them....we created them out of our love into perfect beautiful little babies!  And staring into their familiar eyes, and looking at their tiny faces as if we were staring back at our own, only strengthens the love I feel for this man....everyday!  I thank God for such an amazing husband, and for blessing us with such beautiful children.

I adore you sweetheart.  Happy Anniversary...and here's to 50 more years!"

"event","Hubby and I saw the Matrix on a 2 1/2 hr. lunch break.  I personally was sad to see it end.  The special effects were incredible in this one.  And you can imagine, I was even more excited when I saw the Aliens undertones in the scene of the battle with the machines and the Zion/man powered machines.  That was pretty fucking cool.  We saw it in the IMAX, so the experience was equally tantalizing to the senses.  Of course, the romantic in me liked all the ""I'll kick everyone's ass for my man"" scenes.  Hubby and I always engage in a deep analytical conversation when we watch a good flick.  He didn't think too highly of it, but I was very impressed.  Again, I was sad to see it end, but I loved it all the same.  When it ended, at first, I was like - so that's it...its over.  But that's the beauty of what the brothers tried to get across.  Its over, but its not over.  They opened our minds to the endless possibilities of ""what if's"" and made us think twice about dejavu, wwrewolves, ghosts and vampires.  I think it ended the way a great movie of its caliber should...the heroes die for a cause...to save humanity.  And isn't it so true that no matter what life threatening events happen in our real lives, once its over, life just goes on.  Much props to the brothers, I think their movies will always be remembered for the ground breaking ideas and pushing us to embrace yet another theory of the future ""machine age"" and taking special effects to the next level.  I'll be watching this movie over and over and over again for years to come!

Ever since the first Matrix movie, Trinity has been my idol.  She's my idol because she's not another leather T&A bitch.  She's got class AND she can kick some ass!  And she's willing to go to the ends of the earth...or rather the Matrix...for her man Neo.  Whom I personally like also.  Therefore, in tribute to the movie and to my girl Trinity, I adopt the bad ass herself as my picture for my journal.  Enjoy!"

"event","The pains of childbirth is one thing, but nothing beats the pain of your heart breaking when you hear the heart felt cries of your babies when they are sick.  Over the last few weeks, I've gone through my two year old being constipated, both kids with runny noses, loss of appetite and my 5 month old getting a bad cold and a cough we can't seem to shake...and not to mention on top of all that, the inevitable monthly check ups and high pitched screams from ""well visit"" shots for the baby.  I thank God that my baby hadn't been sick like my 2 year old with stomach viruses, flu or other tear jerking ailments.  But this last week has been very difficult for me and hubby.  The baby caught a cold last weekend.  He started with the usual runny nose, loss of appetite and fussiness.  We thought it was weather related and treated it like a cold.  Then I started getting sick.  Gabi and I had just had our flu shots, so I was certain we wouldn't get the flu, but knew a cold was inevitable.  Then, the baby's symptoms got a little worse.  He started with the low grade fevers, not sleeping at night because he couldn't breathe and not eating.  He was constantly fighting me to clean his nose and take medicine, and it was tearing at my heart to hear him not able to breathe and sleep, and then it happened.  Gabi started with the runny nose, sneezing and whinny cries.  Then, I started getting sick.  I started with the runny nose, sneezing, sore throat.  I took medicine and assured myself I just needed to rest.  Then, started the chills, sweats, achy neck, back and sore ribs, throbbing headache and congestion.  I felt like I had MAC written on my forehead from the head on collision with it.  I asked hubby to stay home Monday to help with the kiddos so I could rest.  Everyone went to the doctor that day and it turned out the kids were fine, just a cold, but mommy had the flu.  Can you fucking believe it?!  What the fuck is a flu shot good for if not from preventing you from getting the fucking flu?!  Well, the doc said it was either a different strand that I contracted or the shot just didn't have enough time to take effect.  So, after 3 days of staying home from work, I'm finally starting to feel better.  And I'm so glad baby #3 (hubby) didn't get the flu, otherwise, I would have had to stay home from work another week!  But we're all getting better now.  

LESSON LEARNED: get the fucking flu shot 3 weeks before flu season hits and stay away from anything that is not your offspring under 3 feet tall, all fucking winter."

"event","Since this is my first time, I thought I might do a little intro/bio on me and my interests.  Some of you may already know all this about me, others may have never known she was like that!

I'm almost thirty-something so I would say I'm a pretty well rounded gal.  I am an eighties child, and here are my interest in music...this may be something I may regret admitting, but here it goes: Def Lepard, Guns-n-Roses...wasn't into the heavy stuff I was pretty much main stream. Prince (my hubby's fav.), Lisa Lisa, DeBarge (yeah, but they were catchy tunes!), Journey, Chicago, Police....and much more.

The other tunes I like to listen to are Jazzy, Blues, Big Band Music like early Harry Connick, Jr., Sade, Seal and Candy Dulfer.  Attributed mostly to my High School Jazz band days...I played the jazzy saxamaphone.  Yeah, I was a band fag...but I was the cutest one!!  Competition was wasn't too fierce.

The other side of me is my heritage.  I love Salsa and Merengue music, and love dancing to it even more.  Hubby and I met at a club so the old tunes of Tito Puentes, Tito Nieves, early Marc Anthony and La India, and Grupo Niche bring back warm fuzzy feelings of when we first met! :)

As for movies, I'm an action/horror flick kind of gal with a splash of hopeless romantic.  My favorite action flicks of all time are Predator and Aliens.  I have the Alien legacy and must admit they are all my favorites.  Although the third one had its down moments, I was still much impressed with the upside down CG effects and man suit in this one.  As for horror flicks, I loved all the late 70's early 80's movies like Amityville Horror, Exorcist, The Beast Within, Rosemary's Baby, When a Stranger Calls and American Warewolf in London.  There aren't many movies that can take the title of good horror flicks these days.  As for the romantic in me, my favs are When Harry Met Sally, Legend, Ghost and Princess Bride.  My fav comedy of all time hands down is Harlem Nights with a well deserving second of So I Married an Axe Murderer.  You have got to see them if you haven't already!

Well, I guess that's all I have for that...now, on to my life..."

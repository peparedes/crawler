Only surprise this year is that the new Dismantled album <b>didn't</b> make the top ten.  Possibly because it's crappy in the same way as the last few Combichrist albums.  Yeah, being an offensive douchebag isn't a replacement for talent, Gary.  Stick a pin in that ego.  Erica on the other hand is a one-woman hit-machine.  Also discovered 4 albums each from AiV & UHH.  Hard to pick the top ones, but still, pretty good stuff.

On the fifth anniversary of God's 9/11 vengeance,
Upon this evil nation for it's sodomite sin!

A opiate utopia, gets hotter by the hour...
You answer to a new name that changes all the time,
I'll call you anything you want, if I can say it's mine.
The story's never-ending, our footprints have been erased
But here you are, I kiss your feelings, see your mouth or is it really...
An invisible light, to keep me alive!
Something really gets dimension, can't you feel it bend your sense of time?</i>

<b>SITD: Rot</b>
<i>No pictures of delight, the king was blind with fear
He tried to find the strength he needs, to calm the doubts of his belief
As darkness fall, the waves roll by...
He's not afraid to die.

All you destroy, all you create, is gone...</i>

<b>Metric: Fantasies</b>
<i>All the gold, and the guns, and the girls, in the world, couldn't get you off...

Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend

<b>Zero Tolerance: Just Another Nightmare Scenario</b>
<i>I exist, within your shadows...
And there's a face he shows only to himself.

Without focus on anything that may have happened to <b>me</b> this year, let's just have a last look at what I've been listening to as it happened instead.  And yes, I'm aware some of these came out before 2008.  I'm very insulated, it takes time for culture to trickle through the filters.

<b>Dismanted: When I'm Dead</b>
<i>Under the flood, I hope you're happy now
When I'm dead, when I'm dead, I hope the planet wipes
every trace of my existence on this wretched ground
But now it's coming down

And I look back, where we started, 
I've so come so far, to lose it all
And no escaping...
Time's up, I'm finally free at last.
Sinking slowly, into the depths, 

Oh what an ending to a wasted life.</i>

<i>Let's escape, underground
Wait forever

I want to crawl on hands and knees, 
I want to crawl, I want to crawl, 
I want to dig a hole in the ground,
I want to crawl inside with you

<b>The Offspring: Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace</b>
<i>How does it feel, when you have it all?
How can you live with nothing at all? 
And the rain comes, and the world is on my head,
crave the sun, but I can't get out of bed.

How does it feel...
And no wonder hearts and minds have been won
and I wonder how it's all come undone

want it you got it you're sorry
want it you bought it you're sliding..
who do you see?  'cause you look a lot like me.</i>

They're in rough order, but keep in mind that it's only my opinion.  Also, I have yet to find a few albums, so i guess they'll have to stack against next year's offerings...

<b>Tegan and Sara: The Con</b>
<i>Maybe I would have been
Something you'd be good at

But now we'll never know</i>

<img src=""http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/zeroswitch/rasp.jpg""/>
<b>Rasputina: Oh Perilous World</b>
<i>A fine piece of ribbon, a cruel separation
A vague intimation of a higher-born station
Your mother was neither a saint nor a whore
Here's a taunting reminder that you were born poor </i>

<b>The Birthday Massacre: Walking with Strangers</b>
<i>If I try to get away,
How long until I'm free?

Will you remember me?</i>

<b>Client: Heartland</b>
<i> Did I forget to mention, I just raised the stakes
Do you know who I am, the girl you love to hate
I don't need to hide, and I don't need to care
Look outside your window, I'm out there</i>

<img src=""http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/zeroswitch/new_maps_of_hell.jpg""/>
<b>Bad Religion: New Maps of Hell</b>
<i>Pilgrim, those are dry and bitter tears and lonely
Eyes that look way beyond your years
Pilgrim, when you left them all behind
The loneliness destroyed your able mind
You were too far gone to carry on, now your life has stalled
As you march ahead yet go no place at all

Pious eyes, ignoring passers by, headlong to their grave
Don't despair this world of toil and care, this pilgrim lost his way</i>

<img src=""http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/zeroswitch/aslan.jpg""/>
<b>Aslan Osiris: When Our Moon Falls</b>
<i>It's like, they don't care about you anymore.
They're not interested in what you're doing with your life, they just don't care.
They're ready to forget that they ever knew you. </i>

<b>Grendel: Harsh Generation</b>

<b>Nine Inch Nails: Year Zero</b>

somehow, in the next 48 hours, i must trim & color the rooster-hawk (that would be hair), finish cleaning the apartment, go to dad's and do my taxes, tape/watch House & Lost, work 12 hours, pick up supplies like vodka, paper towels, incense, maybe some food for the guests.  also practice mariokart, soul calibre, metroid, pikmin, x-men... maybe some sleep.  

admittedly, the list doesn't sound impossible, but limiting myself to foot & bus travel certainly slows things down.  hrrm.

not much else to report.  3 day & 4 night weekend is proving excessively long.  on the plus side, i started a remix of Survivalism that sounds 0% like the original (possibly because i don't own a mac, and therefore can't actually make use of the remix kit as intended).  whatever, the end result is more my ""style"" anyways.  once q-ball mashes with it, bam!

"event","jenni did this, and i'll fill it out, mostly for her and q-ball, but really i don't care much for ""horror"" anymore.  (listen to a few dozen hours of testimony from people tortured in abu ghraib & guantanamo for months/years without trial, and then watch '24' or 'Saw' and see how entertaining they f*cking are).  anyways.

<lj-cut text=""horror quiz...""> 

The greatest horror movie ever is 28 Days Later.  (Se7en & Silence of the Lambs & Alien3 too, but they're suspense/sci-fi, so...)

Saw is my least favorite ""horror"" movie.  (actually, it's one of my least favorite THINGS, ever.  send the creators to darfur or afghanistan and see how much <b>they</b> ""appreciate life"".  idiots.)

'It' frightened me when I was a kid and still continues to do so now.  (as an aside, Ghostbusters frightened me as a kid, but doesn't anymore.  Phew.)

I have NO idea why The Ring is considered to be a ""horror classic"".  (but then, i refuse to see it, so...)

Cillian Murphy should have gotten an Oscar nom for his (or her) work in 28 Days Later (only performances in horror movies allowed here).   

The bridge scene in Ghostbusters <b>did </b> traumatize me for life!  (fyi, the bridge scene is when Ray & Winston are talking about the end of the world, and the dead rising from the grave.  ""it is impossible to describe the terror i felt."")

Cube had the greatest opening to a horror movie.

The goriest movie I have ever seen is Dead Alive.  (Evil Dead 2 comes close though.)

I was saddened when *SPOILERS*
.
.
.
.
.
The old wheelchair guy got killed off in The Relic.

Event Horizon is actually a good movie, despite what the majority says.

The ending to Se7en was absolutely shocking!

The last horror movie I saw was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes, and I watched it because I was at q-ball's.  (that's actually enough of an explanation).

Good Acting over Special Effects any day!  (choose between the two horror movie icons: Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers).  (no.)

I would least like to run into a gang in a dark alley way.

If Ghostbusters ever gets remade, I'll sigh and not be surprised.

No one can convince me that Saw is a good horror movie.

The Sixth Sense is well shot, well written, decently acted, not bad.

The Exorcist is kinda slow, but still neat.

Halloween is probably crap.

Nothing beats Alien in terms of of genuine scares.  

Overall, 2007 has been an exploitive year for horror movies."

I have so much junk at home, but only feel like cleaning it when I'm at the office.

I had the strangest dream.  Combined many recurring dream-themes: going home, home being sold, hiding smut, being younger, invisibility, voyeurism, psychically manipulating my environment, the 'secret world of girls', levitation, university, rage, discovery of relics, etc.  Not sure what all that was trying to tell me, maybe it was the pizza.

Noticing a lot of army recruitment commercials that have little to do with killing people or invading other countries, and more to do with ""cool"" machines and ""extreme"" activities.  Yes.  Well, if you're going to lie by omission, I guess TV commercial breaks are the place to be. 

Anyhow, since I feel better now, and thought about it for a week, here's a conclusion I came to but didn't post right away:

I recall scene from the Simpsons where Nelson the bully is making Milhouse the dweeb hit himself with his own fist, and saying, ""Why are you hitting yourself?  Stop hitting yourself!""

Now, if Milhouse wasn't a dweeb, he probably wouldn't be picked on by Nelson...  Alright, sure. But does that make Nelson's behaviour any better?

Or to put it another way... if I wasn't depressed and bleak, it'd probably be easier for me to meet, make, and keep friends.  Fair enough.  But, does that absolve the people who jumped ship when things got rough?

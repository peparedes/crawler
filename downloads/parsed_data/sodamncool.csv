"event","Quick update, Tan wonder is officially gone as of last friday.

So anyway, I was at work this weekend, listening to the jibber-jabber of the blubbering masses that meander the aisles of my delightful store, when I heard some black lady call for her kid.  Funny thing, it sounded like she was shouting <i>Bacardi! Yo Bacardi! Git yo' boofy ass back heah afoh I smack you!</i>  Then it hit me: <i> I am going to name <b> ALL</b> of my kids after alcohol! Purely brilliant!</i>  Of course, we'll start off the female offspring of mine as Bacardi, 'Rona, and Kahlua, and with the guys named Jack, Jim, and Bud.  Ah hell, throw in a dog named Jose Cuervo and there you have it.  Admit it, ANY dog named after an alcoholic beverage, be it tequila or not, (MAYBE with the exception of wine coolers) makes for one badass mo'fuggin dog.  I don't know, simply a thought i had.

I have begun a quest for a picture, and this picture will make for one of my funniest desktops and even some of my best animations ever, if i can only get soem decent pics of what i want. <i>DERRR!!!</i>

I found one!  hahaha! You'll see it where my face is supposed to be. that is so damn funny."

A Musical tribute I'd like to see at the Oscars: 

A clip montage from Rain Man, The Other Sister, Radio, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, I Am Sam, and Of Mice and Men set to the Black Eyed Peas song ""Lets Get Retarded""
-------------------------------------

simply had to share that with you.  i was tickled, and i hope you were too.  havent updated much, im too inconsistent to keep a damn journal lol.  i have manymanymany more stories to share wit j00 all, just keep looking and eventually they will come.  thank you to the 3 or 4 people that read my journal for giving a damn about someone SO DAMN COOL.  hehehe

looking forward to english tomorrow, My partner and I are setting the bar for informative foolishness.  it will be most tasty.  i almost feel bad for the groups following us hehehe. It's horrible.  we indirectly trash most TV icons, and most races as well, as well as most intellectual levels.  tasty.  we have too many references to count in it, and i KNOW that most groups will be going home that night revising and revising and revising their presentations to <i>try</i> to even be <i>half</i> as hilarious as my group's presentation.

until next time,

"event","I just stubbed my toe JUST now, it hurts than the one time this fat kid stepped on my infected toe.  long story.  

ANYWAY

The <i>LEGEND OF THE TAN WONDER</i> remains just that: a legend.  The tan piece of shit is no more.  It is being towed as of this week.  

Now, what would be a proper death to a legacy if there wasn't a birth to a new one?  That's right kids, i gots me some new wheels!  I be rollin out in my '90 Ford Taurus.  One piece of trouble though.  I have not yet a good nickname for it.  So far, I have thought of Clint Taurus (say it <i>REAL</i> fast, do it.)  if any of j00 can think of anything better, you know who to scream at.

So anyway, i think i am going to write a screenplay or something about one of my recurring nightmares.  yes, i am considering bringing Tales From My Head (wOOoooOoOOoOooO) part 1 to at least some sort of kickass novel. or movie.  or something that'll make me stinking rich.  

My current project is dropping my cd player from the tan wonder into the taurus (its ice blue and shiny - the car, not the cd player.)  there are 2 ways to go about this.  i can do this the right way, which is shell out 10$ of my hard earned (yeah right) cash to get a wiring kit and ensure myself success, or go the roundabout nigger route where i not only risk blowing a few fuses, the battery, or the cd player itself, but i may also get teh shockies.  right now the latter appeals to me, but we shall see.

anyway, i have some history ghomework and some video game playin'.  im out.

fear the beast.  shitass."

"event","wow, 2 songs lol.  anyway, today was simply priceless.  fucking priceless.

starts off @ rob's house, where i stayed the night.  was looking forward to a day of FUN WITH GUNS!, and i got it.  hoo boy did i get it.  i was happy.  we started the day shooting icicles off rob's roof, then we moved our antics outward, off to *gasp* THE BAZAAR!!! *ungasp*  we check out tazers first, saw one that looked like a cell phone!  awesome!

we look 5 inches below it, and we saw the biggest tazer on earth, one that could be used to rape elephants.  our jaws dropped and our eyes glistened as we (me, josh, eric) DROOLED over this fine piece of equipment.  We moved on.  We meandered around the bazaar until we got to the entire point of the trip: AMERICAN HEROES.  Among other things at this little hut-o-american-quality-destruction, we stared at US Marine Corps ""Semper Fidelis"" flags, and various *controversial* flags from throughout history.  We marveled at the cane-swords and I bought my new weapon of choice, the blowgun.  (i have to buy some darts for it =) ) and a 10.00$ pack of painballs.  hoo boy i was happy.  i also bought a laser sight for my air pistol (tested and approved by several US Marine Corps officials).

needless to say we laughed our asses off because our paintballs bounced off of everything (including SEVERAL RTA stops.)

So anyway, some shit happened at work and i was busy as hell.  this kid that i call Hot Wheels was pissing me off, and i scared his fat ass half to death with my blowgun (bwahahaha).

Thats about all i feel like typing right now.  Next  time i shall share The Legacy Of Hot Wheels to you all.  It will be most amusing.  Tune in tomorrow, folks.

Until then,

Gatka and I had a jolly good time OWNING several inanimate objects (I KICKED YOUR ASS YOU DIET COKE CAN BWAHAHAHAHA).  Gatka showing me his taliban move was amusing as well.  We also had a laughy laugh at the *soulless* democratic candidates for the upcoming election.  Although he can scream better than most girls i know, sadly, Howard Dean is a loser.  and a tool.  anyway, i had fun, i hope you did too.

"event","Now, I know that many of you are avid fans of reading what keeps me up at night, and I thought I would bring you a *crowd gasps* >>NEW<< miniseries for my journal

From the people that brought you <i>Tales From My Head (WoooOOoOoOOoOooo)</i> comes:

OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO MY CAR?!? (Due to graphic language, viewer discretion is advised.  With that said, fuck you :P)

I think it's a catchy title.  leave a comment at what you think.  but now, its the first chapter of ""OMGWTF Happened to my car?!?""  (for the full effect, get your hands on that adam sandler song and listen to it through the rest of the journal.)

So, as a number of you may or may not have heard, i got into an accident a few thursdays ago on account of icy roads and my car is a piece of shit.  I figured all damage was purely cosmetic since i was still able to drive it.  Hoo boy was I mistaken.  I had Brian Ruttledge (i cant spell his last name for shit) look at my car yesterday, he drove it to VF and almost died in it.  He pulls into VF parking lot, and the alternator belts break and fall off, and the lights stop working.  He pulls my car into the garage, and almost breaks shit, not because my brakes are shit, but because my carburetor and transmition are shit as well.  So I get home, to find out that my car is no longer road worthy (who would have GUESSED???)  so I am in a predicament where i either spend a few hundred (that may turn into SEVERAL if i want it to pass e-check :P) or i simply buy a new car.  I have 2 cars lined up, a '93 Ford Probe (Dezelan's car) or a '96 Mitsu Galant (my sis's b/f).  Both cars are fucking NICE.  BUT, they arent available to me RIGHT NOW, which kinda pisses me off.  Im gonna have to wait a while for the probe and maybe even longer for the galant.  so im not exactly sure which Im gonna buy.  

<i>WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE TAN WONDER???  HAS CROWE'S CAR SEEN ITS LAST DAYS ON THE ROAD???  WILL YOU SEE CROWE ROLLING OUT IN AN ACTUALLY COOL CAR?!?!?</i>

all this and more in the next episode!

until then...

"event","Yay, I passed my Cisco 3 Final with a 71.3%.  I BARELY passed.  jesus.  After that, i went home for lunch, went and mesed around during my math midterm and went home.  sat down.  fell asleep.

woke up @ 5:30 'cause of another goddamn nightmare.  goddammit goddammit goddammit.  Usually I don't mind nightmares (y'know.  Its like watching a horror movie, or watching an Olsen twins movie/tv show (just as scary, maybe even scarier), but now they interrupt my sleep.  That pisses me off.

I dreamt I was at a stop sign with Martin in the passenger seat, waiting for busy traffic to clear so i can move my fucking car.  All of a sudden i feel a sharp pain at my left.  I look, and <i>I GET T-BONED BY SOME DUDE I SEE AT MARCS ALL THE TIME.</i>  <b>He just so happens to look just like Osama Bin Laden.</b>  So we cut to a scene with me limping around at the Police station and I'm bitching the fucker out, saying that if i could feel my arms I would bash his face in.  (mind you, i have only seen this guy, i have never actually spoken to this guy in real life).  All of a sudden he gets forceful....  im talking creepy forceful.  not forceful like your girlfriend pinning you down and youre sarcastically like ""oh no... stop.... uhhh yeah.... thats what they say.... stop...."".  He advances toward me, all saying ""You had better shut up BILL!!!  <i>I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU!!!</i>""

then i woke up.

lets review the fucked up dreams as of late

<ul>
<li>getting beaten by a self-resurrecting menace (who is NOT named dennis)</li>
<li>my dick hanging out at courtney's house</li>
<li>my hair jumping off of my head</li>
<li>getting hit by creepy terrorist guy's car</li>

"event","Ahhhhh.  It feels <b>great</b> to be able to sit down and just listen to some music.  It's been a busy, tiring, and headache-inducing 2 days.  After the last day of the semester yesterday, I had THE biggest headache imaginable.  I get on the bus, and O'boyle and some pregnant teens on my bus get into an argument because Tom simply can't keep his mouth shut.  Headache grows.  I let one of the pregnant's off before me, doing the gentlemanly thing, when she just simply walks too damn slow (she's VERY early in the pregnancy, and VERY capable of moving faster than a goddamn ant.)  and hovers in front of the doors, i cant get by.  Headache grows.  I get back to school, and Courtney wants me to drop Megan off, no problem for me.  My massive headache got me incredibly irritable, and it made it look like i was pissed at megan, which i wasnt.  I felt bad for Megan, because they both thought i was pissed at her.  Oh well, can't change that now.  work was meh as usual yesterday.

I woke up <i>5</i> minutes before i had to be at work for new register training (wasnt supposed to, but the managers made me anyway)  so i was at work from 9-12 because of that.  i got home, ate 2 bowls of mac and cheese, talked to courtney and went to work at <b>2</b>.  so i worked 2-9:50, totalling for about 11 hours of work today.  thats double my normal shift.  I got home and took a shower, and I am talking to Courtney right now.  That was the past 2 days for me.

i had another fucked up dream.  not fucked up as in <i>OH MY GOD IS MY FACE STILL IN ONE PIECE?</i> fucked up but it was wierd.  I dreamt my girlfriend lived next door to me, which was awesome.  But i dreamt i almost backed my car off of a cliff, which magically appeared across the street from me.  so i dreamt that it was today about 8 in the morning, and i was with courtney in her room, and we were doing (CENSORED, small children may be reading this.)  and just hanging out.  so it turns out i am in my boxers.  i go to get a pop, and courtney's dad walks by, points at me, and says ""put it away.""  i look down, and it turns that my ""third leg""  was hangin' out (literally).  so i tucked it back in my boxers and went along my business.  (i just realized that i probably should not be sharing this, but oh well its already here)  so i dreamt that i looked at my watch and saw it was 1:00.  i simply didnt go to my training session.  then i woke up and went to work.  I'll share a better dream next time,  I just need to remember the better ones.

"event","Meh, easyjournal was givin me crap about messages, so I am trying this one, we wil see what happens (bwa hah aha hahahahaha)...... (ha.)

today was a usual day, except for the fact that since my car has been bashed in, i drive it less frequently.  That said, I now once again utilize the privileges i once abused (and abused them i did, like a redheaded stepchild on welfare)  so since i didnt drive, my dad felt it less-than-convenient for me to come over all-of-a-sudden.  Eventually he grew a pair and picked me up.  the usual happens, talk with the fam, get abused at a local department store, the usual outburst of ""SUCK ME!"" in the department store, trading and laughing at mishaps and funny stories/situations/conversations we had.  I was killing myself laughing at the stories my stepmom was telling about her sex life.  May sound a little wierd trading stories about our sex lives, but we get a jolly good kick out of it.  

so anyway, my dad calls me in ""sick"" so my stepbrother can drive me to school about 10:30, seems like my dad is forming a trend out of it.

So anyway, I have some seriously fucked up dreams.  seriously.  fucked.  notdown.  

one dream i had a month or so ago was about this monster/demon/corpse thing my grandfather had in his basement.  i came across a body bag in his basement and he explained it to me.  he had said it comes to life once every [interval of time, could have been a week or a month, i dont remember]  and every time it resurrects, he has to kill it.  also, every time it resurrects, it gets stronger.  so quite a while passes by and i forget all about it.  my grandfather comes up to me, and explains he no longer is strong enough to kill the damn thing anymore, and leaves it for me to inherit (thanks gramps.)  so anyway, apparantly in this dream i live in an abandoned newspaper factory/warehouse, and my friend and i carry the bodybag into the basement and put it behind some boxes.  a while passes, and i awaken in teh middle of the night to horrid blood curdling screams, sounds of metal scraping against metal, etc etc.  i knew right away the fucking thing came to life.  i slowly creep down teh stairs armed with a 9mm and an ice pick/railroad spike thing.  I take a look, and it looks like a combination of the creeper (from jeepers creepers) and Nemesis from the Resident Evil series.  obviously i shat myself.  It advances toward me (and by advances, i mean OH MY GOD KILL IT NOW!!! speed) and i unload my clip from the 9mm into it, to no avail.  apparantly my grandfather never attempted to shoot it, or just neglected to tell me it was immune to bullets.  i proceeded to bludgeon the thing to death with the pointy object in my hand.  shivering, i pile it back into the bag and tuck it away again.  this sort of thing happens for quite some time until it finally gets the upper hand on me.  it knocks my ""killing tool"" out of my hand, knocks me down, and proceeds to step on my head, over and over and over.  Blind with excrutiating pain, I do what everyone else would do when they live in <i> a fucking gigantic empty warehouse,</i> call for help.  the words that i blurt out as my melon gets 0wned are ""ADAM!! HELP!!""  apparantly i had called for the assistance of someone i have only met through an AOL Instant Messenger screen.  Sure enough, the kid comes out of <i>butt-fucking nowhere</i> and picks up my killing tool and splits the fucker's head open.  (***EDIT: my good AIM friend Adam has provided an interpretive picture describing the situation.  Original pic copyright of Capcom corp. : http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/0903/ctfan1/kronosre3.jpg ***)  Relieved, i consult him about my dilemma.  he suggests that we chop it up limb from limb, figuring that it can't resurrect if it wasnt whole.  so we chopped it up, put the various entrails into sandwich bags, tossed the bags into the body bag, threw it behind the boxes as per usual, and adam leaves.  Ultra relieved that I got that monkey off my back, i take a well-earned nap against one of the upstairs wall.  I wake up some hours later to the sound of water dripping and heavy breathing, accompanied by the occasional throaty-growl or grunt.  Dazed, all i see in front of me is a pair of feet.  I, in my sleep-induced inebriated state, look up.  <i>the fuckin thing was alive!</i>  It cranks back his arm, now bearing a sizably large rusty axe, begins to swing, and then i wake up.  tell me how fucked up that is.  still creeps me out to this day.

I'm sure I will share more <i>Tales from My Head</i> (woooooOoooOoOOoooo) in future installments.  that one was just too long for me to stand to add another one in.

with that, i bid you all adieu.

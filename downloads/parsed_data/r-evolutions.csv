"event","We're selling the house in Oakville. It looks like I'll be moving into an apartment with my dad in Toronto and my mum will be living in Burlington. I saw this coming. Home life wasn't exactly stable. I'm surprisingly fine with the whole situation. Well, I am upset and such but it's not as if I didn't have any emotional baggage before. I'm actually looking forward to the move, I fucking hate Oakville. I'm tired of plazas and SUVs and soccer moms and shopping malls. I'm going back to the city and I'm estatic. I'll find myself a job and prove that I can be self-reliant and since it looks like we'll be living downtown (or somewhere very close to downtown) my social life will be a thousand times better. I don't know, I feel as if I'm finally going back to where I belong. I know this is going to make my parents happy. My dad will be making more money since he'll be in the city and my mum will be closer to her work. I'll still be going to Sheridan but I don't mind the commute. 

We were originally going to put the house on the market in March but it looks like it may be sooner. We're all kind of anxious to leave. I wouldn't mind having the closing date sometime in November. Moving away would be an excellent 18th birthday present."

Holy hell I love my kitty. I'm convinced he's the sweetest thing in the entire world. I was sitting with him just now and every time the pipes in the house made a noise, he jumped a little and ran over to where I was sitting and ran beneath my legs. I had to lift him up, he was all scared. He also likes to sit in front of my monitor and try and bat at the mouse as it moves across the screen. It's cute, but he likes to walk all over my keyboard too -__-

I'm going shopping tomorrow! Like, omigod, there's a sale. Actually, I'm going with Nathan and we'll probably end up walking around town or something. We're planning something big for next week. Fear and Loathing in Oakville. 

I totally got my G1 bitches. About fucking time."

"event","I'm having a weird day today. I fell alseep watching Invader Zim last night at like 7 and I slept until 8:45 this morning. I'm still exhausted and I don't know why. Maybe I'm not feeling too well, I'm kind of down and out of it. I watched a lot of Invader Zim and I hung out with Ryan a bit. Nothing really interesting happened today. I got my hair cut and I bought Fahrenheit 451.  

Friday night was neat, Mike came over and we had pizza and watched Hellraiser. He slept over and stayed until Saturday afternoon. It was awesome, I love him so much. 

All of a sudden I have this craving for all these material things that I never really wanted before. That's weird for me but I feel like going shopping and getting stuff I don't really need. That's not true. I need new pants so I'm going to get those, and my dad said he'd buy me a pair of shoes because he's proud of me. That's pretty sweet. 

I won some award at school, I have to go to this special luncheon and collect it, I don't know what it's all about. Some ""Championship Award"" deal. 

Um, I'm not the same person I was a year ago. I'm trying to figure out when I changed, why I changed and whether or not it's a good thing. I don't think it is. Sam said something about me being a better person before, or more of a person, or something like that. I don't know. I'm half a person now, I don't feel whole right now. I haven't felt whole since last summer."

Someone dropped the role and Melissa was desperately trying to find someone to fill it and I volunteered. She's rather happy with me now I think, she wanted me to audition in the first place but I was stubborn and refused. 

I quit my job but I did it nicely, I'm still on call whenever they need me but I won't be going in every weekend anymore. That's a load off my mind.

I'm going to Sheridan, I've got some money in the bank, I can fuck around with my hair again and my documentary is being submitted to the Halton Film Festival.

I have the most wonderful boyfriend in the world and I don't think I could ask for anything from him. <3 <3 <3 I'm going to Mike's tomorrow and sleeping over, it should be totally kickass.

I also think I'm the only person in the class who doesn't hate our current reading material. 

I can't wait until Saturday. The last couple of weeks have been stressful in regards to school and work and the only thing that has gotten me through the last three weeks is the thought that I'll be seeing Mike on the weekend.

Things are starting to look up. I've got my doctor's appointment rescheduled to Thursday and I'm seeing Mike this weekend :D. He's waaaay too awesome to even comprehend, I'm so lucky. :D

I got into an arguement with Sam today which was unfortunate. I said a few things I shouldn't have but I think it was only because of all the pent up emotion that has been building up over the last few days.

I saw Dustin today at lunch, it was rad! I had to leave and study for my religions test but it was good to see him nonetheless, he said he may be back tomorrow. It was weird, Ryan and Dustin and Andrew and I were hanging out and it was like a flashback to a few months ago. Right down to Andrew stealing my food, grrr.

"event","Well, I'm alive. I went to the plaza today with Sam and we went to Tim Hortons for cookies. We ended up just grabbing some freshly baked ones that looked like chocolate chip. Turns out they weren't. I devoured a whole peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie before I realized, ""Oh shit.""
Called my dad, waited and waited in pain and he showed up with my antihistemine. It didn't do anything. I was getting a little panicky. When I got home I realized that I had to go to the hospital, so we left. I could barely breath by the time I got there. I had thrown up, my throat was swollen and my chest was so tight I wasn't sure I'd make it. I did, thankfully. I got treated right away and had all sorts of needley things stuck into me and whatnot. I stayed there for five hours and just got home now. What a night. I had absolutely no idea I was anywhere remotely that allergic to peanuts. Usually it's a bit of uncomfortable swelling which goes away quickly but this was intense. I'm glad I went to the hospital, I don't know what would have happened if I didn't.

There's my adventure. It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for my stupidity and Sam's insistence on getting cookies (I kid, I kid).

One of the drugs they gave me made me reeeeeeally sleepy, so I'm going to bed soon."

"event","Ryan's an asshole and I jsut wish he told me that our friendship was worth nothing to him so I would stop trying to make it work. I should have gotten the hint when he started avoiding me.
I'm so fucking naive and so fucking needy, no wonder everyone is so sick of me.
It's my fault for being such a shitty person to be around I guess, but I didn't expect this kind of shit from Ryan. God this hurts. This hurts a whole fucking lot and I don't know if I can trust him anymore.

I don't need this right now, not with so many other things going wrong.

Edit: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Now Andy is pissed off at me, I fucking fail at life"

think of flirting and whatnot and I'm completely oblivious if it's

<lj-cut text=""Alright, vacation rundown""> 
<font size=""2"">I bought: <br>
-a pair of camo pants, British patten<br>
-a mousepad in the shape of a human head with all sorts of mechanical parts inside<br>
-a book on digital art, a book by Philip K. Dick (The Man in High Castle, I finished it last night) and an Instant German book<br>
-lots of chocolates<br>
-a skirt from Dorthy Perkins<br>
<br>
In the same day I saw two films, Me, Myself and the Universe (Ich und
Das Universum) and Grandpa's Still in the Tuff Shed AND I went to two
different art galleries and a cafe. It was all very cultured. <br>
I went drinking with my cousins, I explored Edinburgh by myself and I also saw a bit of this Danish film called the Idiots.<br>
I like British television, advertisements and news broadcasts, I like British men and I like British chocolate.<br>
<br>
I hate Heathrow airport and I hate children on airplanes. <br>

Um.. I leave for Scotland today, I'm excited. I have to finish packing
and I have a 101 and one things to do before I go. For one, I have to
talk to Conrad before I leave. I think I'm getting an internet crush.
At least I've talked to him on the phone. I don't think I can stress
how hot his accent is. I found myself a cute German and the only
problem is that he's in fucking Germany.<br>

Yesterday I had a nice talk with Ryan. By talk, I mean I broke down in fucking tears and didn't stop crying for a good half hour while he wished he was someplace else. I miss having Ryan to talk to. 
Don't bother asking me why I was crying, I couldn't tell you.

"event","I went into Toronto yesterday and got coffee and lunch with Daniel. It
was nice, I don't see him as often as I should. We had the most
emotional conversation while out for coffee, it was brutal. We were
just discussing life and where we were going and who we left behind and
who drifted away, etc etc. It was very upsetting actually but I'm glad
we had that talk, it was comforting in its own way.
I really do depress everyone around me. <br>
<br>
I'm reading Microserfs by Douglas Coupland, I like it.<br>
<br>
I leave for Scotland this Friday. I'm so incredibly excited, Scotland
has been my favourite place since I was a little girl. I was dreading
going because of missing work and school but I got everything sorted
out so there's no problem and now I'm home free. Two weeks of temperate
(rainy) Scottish weather, sheep, family, drinking with my cousins and
lots and lots of British cigarettes. Unfortunately, I'm going to
miss <lj user=""ekim_chipter"" />'s
birthday which is a downer. What I'm worried about is getting stopped
at the airport, it always happens. It's usually because of the boots,
or the metal or something, it's a pain.<br>
<br>
I have a paper to write, it has to be four pages long. It was due on
Friday. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, that's why I'm
keen on going to Scotland because I like running away from all my
problems. I don't know, I need to get this checked out. I can't focus,
I'm not motivated, I have no ambition and no attention span. I'm always
tired, irritable and my emotions are so unstable it's pathetic. <br>
<br>
I want to leave so badly. <br>

"event","So Andy just left. We went into Toronto yesterday, I bought bondage cuffs and a cute new sweater. We went into Northbound Leather. I hadn't been before and I was pretty impressed, they have some lovely stuff in that store. We ended up going home kind of early and skipping dinner to watch a movie. Today, we went to the surplus store and watched Saving Private Ryan. It was nice. I think Andy and I have lost our spark though, we spend a lot of time arguing. It makes me sad that I can't even keep one fucking guy in my life. I'm losing him just like I lost Ryan and every other guy friend. 

What else makes me sad is how everyone around me is either in a relationship, fooling around with someone or has some sort of love life. I'm rarely outside of a relationship and when I am, it makes me really upset. I don't know, I guess I define my worth based on whoever I'm dating. If I'm not dating anyone, I'm worthless. I suppose I ought to get some self esteem but I don't know anywhere that sells it. 
God, I've really hit a new low. I'm depressed because every girl I'm friends with has a guy that likes her. Just because I don't this automatically makes me less of a person. The way I see it, it means I'm unattractive or my personality is shit. Probably both, but that's not the point. 

On a brighter note, I love this band/artist/project. Hindu Pez = awesome. I haven't been this enthusiastic over music since I came across Klangstabil.

Oh, and the last thing I want is someone saying ""oohh, I like you Alex, you should feel better, blah blah blah"". I'm not in the mood for sympathy, I just needed somewhere to rant."

There was one fucking movie I wanted to see with Andy and it's not playing at the Royal anymore. It ran for  less than a week :( 
Now we have nothing to do Saturday night. I really wanted to see that movie too, I think I'm going to go and cry."

"event","I love how outraged I should be, but I don't care at this point. I'm actually starting to be happy. I have a job, my marks are good, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to get into college. 
I realize that I essentially have no life. I don't go out into Toronto often, I don't drink, I don't ever party, etc etc. I realized that I like my life this way. Yes, I complain about it, but if I really wanted to change, I would have done so by now.
I know that a lot of people must think I'm pathetic, but I'd rather be home alone or with one other person I really love than with a bunch of idiots I don't even like getting smashed off my ass. 
Yes, I hate Oakville. Yes, I hate high school. Yes, sometimes I feel like I'm so completely walled in and trapped that I'll go insane. But I also know that all this will pass and I'll move on to bigger and better things. I'll go off to college, study something I actually enjoy, meet new people, move out, travel and do everything I want to do.
I think I want to travel more than anything. I'd love to sell off everything and spend forever moving from country to country. It's Spalding wanderlust apparently, my dad says it always kicks in about this age."

"event","""All the cool kids are doing it. And by cool, of course I mean
non-conformist, non-mainstream cool. Like, uncool cool. Anti-cool.""<br>
It's true. Sex with ugly people makes me hip. 
Oh god, who am I kidding. I'm not even scoring with the ugmos. :(<br>
<br>
I went to Humber College for an assessment today, I am SO PROUD. I
actually left the house and went somewhere I had never gone before
without having some sort of anxiety attack. I wrote an essay, filled
out a questionaire and did a grammar test. Then I wandered around
campus. I applied to the Media Foundation program and I really want to
get in. It covers everything -- webdesign, digital imagining,
photography, journalism, film surveying, internet surveying (and
research!) and design techniques. Sounds delicious<br>
<br>
I'm looking for new experiences this week.<br>
<br>
My fucking jacket zipper broke.<br>
<br>
I didn't bother going to school today.<br>
<br>
I worked out after I popped into work and saw Sam."

"event","Last night was pretty nice. I had a weird stay-at-home day because I was sick, so I didn't do much of anything except write and clean. I ended up reading a whole shitload of stuff last night and talking to Valerie and going through some old photographs. It was quite possibly the best nostaglic lapse I've had in a long time. I forgot how awesome the combined powers of Val and Alex are.

I also stumbled across pictures from last winter with Sam and I (and Ryan!) and some of our silly photoshoots. We look so unbelievably young. And I look so god damned GOTHY. I forgot how long my hair used to be. It was sexy.

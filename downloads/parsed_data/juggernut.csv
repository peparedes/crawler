"event","So MIAD is now over for me. Four years of the most physically and mentally excruciating work that I have ever endeared. Probably for nothing. $80,000 in debt for something that I may never use for professional reasons.

But I did it for me and I am glad. 

I've been rather mopey lately.
Is it terribly hard to be friends with a girl that has a fiance? 
I don't get how far the friendships I have made here in Milwaukee have drifted from me. They were so strong in those first years. Have I really changed much? It's hard. I have a man that I will marry, a new car, a house of my own, two dogs and the intent to start a family and go places. I have dreams and plans that have a very good chance of happening. 

I feel that just because of these things, perhaps that makes me undesirable as a friend to my peers. They rarely have boyfriends. They party all of the time. They move to a new apartment every month, take the bus everywhere, go everywhere - whenever they want. Nothing to tie them down, they have no plans. 

I'm still an open book. I would like to go to parties, but am never asked. I would like to hang out in bars but am unable to do so often because of my fucking asthma. I am 21 - I want to drink, I want to dance. I want to hang out and have fun - but is it because I seem too busy to responsible that nobody asks? 

So I had my own party. Invited everyone. Hyped it up. Flyers, invitations, word of mouth&nbsp; - everything I could think of. All my friends said they would come. So I got a keg, cleaned my house and ::jazzed:: it up. I had a table full of booze, a tub full of ice and wine. I even had bendy straws and little umbrellas. I strung up fancy outdoor lights in the back yard and paper lanterns in the basement. I filled huge bowls with popcorn and chips. 

Nobody I invited came. Not one fucking person showed up. Not even my best friend, who even called me when she was ""on her way""&nbsp; (several times, I may add) with some other friends. 
Alan waited with me until finally his best friend, Jon showed up with two other guys. 
We had fun. Drank and played card games. And Scrabble.

What a party. 
I guess I just can't compete. I tell myself - it was the last day of school, there were probably 50 other parties going on. I live on the South Side - and everyone else is on the East Side. I bet it's just more convenient to party someplace you can stumble home from. 

But why wasn't I told of these awesome parties...

Double burn: my family came to my graduation, which was fine. I would have been pissed if they hadn't. After the ceremony was over, my wants were not even of concern. I would have liked to stay and stand in a crowded room with those I just graduated with. Even if none of them were my friends, it would have been nice to bullshit with them anyway. Drink some wine, eat some cakes. Perhaps I would have even been invited to an after party. But my mom wanted to go shopping for a hat for Michelle's Civil War Day, Mikala was bitchy as always, my dad was hungry and had a desperate craving for Margaritas and my aunt was just bored. 

I got to stay for 15 lousy minutes. My parents hadn't even bothered to ask if I wanted my picture taken with anyone else. They didn't even take their picture with me. I barely ran into Kat on our way out the door. She said she would call me if she went to a party, but she sounded as if she were obligated to. 
I played hostess to my family for the rest of the night. I served food from the grill and mixed drinks as we sat around our new patio furniture and fire bowl. It was fun, but I am upset by the fact that I was unable to spend that night with friends.

We'll see who still keeps in contact. See who drifts away forever. I can honestly not wait to go home to Gleason. Where my true friends always are. I haven't been able to see them in so long. i hope to be able to visit regularly during the summer. Now that I have my own car and hardly any obligations. 

Until Fall - when I will be starting a different school - of this, I am afraid. MIAD was more like an intense High School - everything was in one building and everyone knew everyone else. Now I must join the ranks of hundreds of thousands and march on the huge campus of a university. I am afraid of huge class sizes, where my teacher will never learn my name or even pick my face out among a hundred other students. I am just worried about there being to man people period. 

I am worried about my health. I had a doctor's appointment on Friday before my family came. I am awaiting the results of several blood tests. As if I didn't have enough health problems:
Chronic migraines
Asthma
Allergies for everything airborne
flexible flat feet
crooked skull
crooked spine
twisted toes
acid reflux
horrible eye sight
brain damage
memory loss


... I might now be anemic, which is the last thing I need. One more respiratory problem that could potentially kill me. 

I'm going to paint my window awnings sky blue and my porch rocker sunshine yellow today. I might even take the dogs to the park - after I talk to Lloyd in financial aid at school..."

"event","When the hell did I become so fucking domesticated?

As years pass it is only natural that you should change and mature and whatnot... but not until the other day had I realize just how crazy different I feel that i have become in the past few years.

I live in a house with a man. We have two dogs and a cute little back yard. I serve dinner and wash dishes by hand. I put pink flamingos in the yard and picked out new window treatments for the living room. I own a mid-sized sedan and desperately want new wall coverings in the kitchen. I'm giddy to be in the beginning stages of planning not only a wedding but a family. Fill me with babies, sir.

what the fuckkk????

Flashback to maybe four years ago... my biggest desire was to have a rockin' sack of dank on a regular basis. Anything beyond that really didn't matter as long as I was smoking it with a group of chill people.&nbsp; Styling my hair consisted of three steps: 1. wash it&nbsp; 2. put it up in a towel&nbsp; 3. shake it out... what it did after that was what it was. 

I wore nothing but jeans (most had holes because I had had them for so long - god knows what brand they were) and a cool t-shirt or hoodie... an occasional vintage sweater and some canvas shoes or flip flops. Pretty much describes what my entire wardrobe was. 

I just pulled open my pant drawer... 60% American Eagle 30% Gap 10% too expensive.
My closet is filled with nice sweaters and t-shirts that I hang up so they do not get wrinkled. 
I have a separate closet in the guest bedroom for dresses and the ""fancy"" outfits.
i love to wear skirts in the summertime.
Sometimes I wear pink.
When I have time, I put products into my hair and straighten it.

Seriously - stoner to suburban house bitch.

Who would have thought?

But I love it. 

My fiance has a great job as a multi-media specialist for the jockey underwear company. I get free panties and socks :)
We will be having a private beach wedding in California. We will send our families to Disneyland while we honeymoon in a random tropical paradise. All inclusive. 
We will buy a nice home near Summit Ave., just outside of Whitefish Bay. Awesome and safe neighborhood... just as big of homes for not as much money. Green yard and our children will go to the best schools. Alan looks forward to buying himself a one man helicopter. I look forward to being able to take a wonderful family vacation at least once every year. 
We'll be able to retire when we want and have plenty of money to relax from then until we die.

Alan bought weed for the first time a week or so ago. I'm proud of my little guy. The friend that came over to sell it to him brought his girlfriend along. We all got stoned and that was when I realized that I had become a domestic. I baked an awesome meatloaf. Served dinosaur shaped cookies that I had made earlier and filled our stoned asses bowls full of popcorn and mini marshmallows. 
Then we played scrabble.

I myself have not boughten weed in nearly three years. I rarely ever smoke it either. Just on the rare occurrence that a friend should ask if I would like to partake. Since I stopped buying, smoking and even selling regularly, friends that were dear slowly fazed themselves out. When you live in city apartments, everyone seems to move every year - and stoners loose too many cell phones. To get in touch at this point could prove to be nearly impossible. 

I feel like a fancy ass. As I look around our home now... pretty much everything that is hung on our walls... all originals. Awesome photos from trips abroad and family get togethers. Original paintings and drawings. 
Last week Alan and I got dressed up and went to an Art Gallery benefit. I bought a print. I got myself a gold star and proceeded to keep my pinky finger in the air for the remainder of the night. 

In a few short weeks I will be a college graduate. I will have a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Sculpture.
Next week I will have to prance around in pretty dresses for several nights and schmooze with Milwaukee's elite.
In three days my thesis is due.
Today I sit, watching strange movie in my underwear with Alan.
Yesterday the Merrill Courier came out and my mother bought nearly 20 copies. I have a 2-page spread.

Got back from California today around 2:00 and made class by 3:30pm. 
Lotsa lotsa fun was had in Cali.

Got there and Thanksgiving went really well. I only ended up having to make the green bean casserole, sweet potato bake, and the pie. I made Alan make the stuffing and his mother bought the turkey and a ham from some store. I baked the pie the day before I left and took it on the plane along with a small tub of artichoke dip... was actually surprised that they let me on with them... they were questioning the solidity of them during my scan. 
And everyone was trying to steal my fucking pie.

Went to New Port Beach and Laguna Beach... went to some arts festival in Laguna... artsy craftsy kinda shit tho...
Got to go to the best art warehouse ever and found my dream book... one on Annette Messager. I had actually been looking to buy one online... but the cheapest I could find it for was $50 used... but I got a brand new one for $30 at this store. I also got super cute little things for Christmas presents and the new Art Now book that even our school library doesn't have. 

Got to see Alan's Brother, Steven's new condo.... HOLY SHIT.... super nice and the grounds has the hottest swim pool area... which Alan and I had all to ourselves one of the days I was there.

Went to Dana's Point on Sunday to be with Alan and his family. 
and Monday was Disneyland! Probably my favorite visit to Disneyland yet... I have been there about six times within the last two years... but this one was the best because, since it was a Monday after a holiday, all of the little kiddies were in school - so there were barely any lines. Except for the Finding Nemo ride because it is still new... and all of the kids that were there were five years old or younger... so they were soaking that ride up.

tomorrow I get to pick up my puppy! eee!"

"event","wow, so it has been a while since I have used this... it has been a while since I even thought of this site.

but life has been good. hell, it has been very good lately.

Alan and I have been engaged for almost two years now... I think that was one of the last things that I posted about.
New car was bought over the summer... her name is Butsechs and we recently hit a milestone - 2,000 miles!
We moved into an adorable little two bedroom house on the South Side of Milwaukee a few months ago.
Alan got a job at a movie editing job downtown called Back Lot Imaging. He's currently doing some editing for a movie called Get Real - it's remake of an old TV show that is staring Steve Carell. Which is amazing - he has been trying to pull some strings so that his name will get into the credits of the film... but it's unlikely. It is still super cool that he gets to do so much work on it though because Steve Carell is HUGE right now. 
Over the summer I had a huge commission with Williams Development and the Riverwalk committee in Downtown Milwaukee creating a permanent sculpture for the ASQ building downtown. You can see it by entering through the Borders book store on Wisconsin Ave. and exiting through the back door by the music department - there is a little corridor that connects Borders to the Courtyard Mariot Hotel and my sculpture is installed in that corridor. Super sweet.
Since then, I have gotten a bunch of smaller private commissions based on the one in the ASQ building, so I haven't been doing too shabby in the finance department lately.
I also got a pretty awesome commission for a company called Artists Working in Education (A.W.E.) where we toured Milwaukee's inner city parks, doing art with all of the kids that were there. My favorite park was Washington Park near Wauwautosa - we were there for two weeks. The Urban Ecology Center put a new location up there during the time that we were there, so we got to make a mural with the kids on their doors and made some wall hangings and stools for them too. During our first week a brother and sister, Naanaa and Kwasi (pronounced Koy-see) came to do art and they like us so much that they followed us around to every park we were at for the rest of the summer. 
Miss them heaps.
Naanaa was the most amazing 3 year old that I have ever met. She told me that I reminded her of Ghana - where her mother is originally from and visits frequently with the children.
My brother and his girlfriend, Jessica got married on 4/20 of last year... go figure and are now expecting their first little bumpkin! And guess who gets to be the Godparents? Could you imagine anyone better suited? Hell yea, cannot wait... definitely going to buy him or her THE loudest most annoying most awesome toys ever.
My cousin, Jason had a baby - a little girl named Breleigh Diane a few months ago - and his sister, my cousin, Melissa is having a little girl any day now! Avaleigh Deanna!

I am working at Koppa's Full Belli Deli on the East Side in the Deli. Super fun place to work - except washing dishes sucks ass.
I am now in my Senior year at MIAD - am graduating in May of '08 - THANK GOD. Definitely ready for that. 
I am flying to California tomorrow morning to be with Alan and his family for Thanksgiving and to apply for teaching jobs right away so that I have a job for next fall. Stupid thing though, when Alan's mum found out that we were coming there for Thanksgiving, she put us in charge of cooking the meal. I have never cooked for Thanksgiving before. I was always in charge of keeping all the rugrats out of the kitchen. But I decided that I wouldn't mind - but she had to come up with the turkey because I don't even get into LA until 2:00pm Thanksgiving Day. Shall be interesting.
We go to Disneyland on Monday - totally wouldn't be a trip to Cali without a visit to Disneyland. This will be my sixth time there in the past two years... so... yeah... I love the place. AND THE FINDING NEMO RIDE IS FINALLY OPEN!!! Cannot express how excited I am for that. 
And! And! The day after we get back - Wednesday, the 28th - we get to pick up our new puppy! We're adopting this super cute little black lab mix from a special needs rescue in Tennessee. She's 9 weeks old and the love of my life. Her and her brother were given up because their mother was a puppy herself - only about 8 months old... and the owners didn't really care for any of them. The puppies got a really bad intestinal infection, which is pretty normal... but since they weren't vaccinated, they got super sick and almost died. But along came the lady I am getting her from who owns this awesome little pet rescue form her home - she got her all of the vet attention that she needed and made her and her brother all better. 
We get to have her here at the house for a few days all by herself before my mom comes down to bring Bailey back. I really think Bailey will like having a little sister. 

...and that's basically it as of late. Pretty exciting shit, I guess."

Alan came on the 4th, and will be here until the 22nd - then he'll start working at his new job for Blizzard's World of War Craft... that sounds like a cool job... and he has an interview to be on the apprentice with donald trump! 



gotta say, I'm proud of my baby... 



and he helped me shovel the drive way the other day (because my dad made me a deal that he would pay for me to rent a car while alan and I are here in gleason (since he took me off his insurrance for their vehicles)if we shoveled the drive way) ...so alan's first time shoveling snow. 



it snowed a butt load everywhere... I wouldn't be suprised if it snowed a foot. 



Got into Gleason on Friday. Saturday Mum, Alan, my sisters, Kala's friend Ally and I all went up to our permanent camp site to go sledding and for a cook out. Sunday Mum took us shopping... ran into Stephanie Gervais at the mall, which was insane in it's own ways. 



Monday I got my chest rays taken to see about any kind of diagnosis... for anything would be nice. 



(oh yeah... I've had this horribly phlemy cough since August... and they told me back in Dcember that it was cold induced asthma and gave me an albuterol inhaler... then I had to go into do further breathing excercises at the marquette student health clinic... and then they put me on this steroid inhaler... and neither inhalers really do anything... it works nice because apparently I've had asthma for a good ten years now... so it helps with helping me catch my breath and such because I along I had just thougt that I am out of shape because... hell... what do I do to keep in shape? ... but my cough hasn't been helped yet.&nbsp;
And my parents are paranoid that I have blastomicosis, because it is really common in the area... and I can't say that I'm not worried about it either... i mean, my father had it in his foot, and we had to put my dog down because of it sooooo... yeah)

fun fun pulminary function test, yeah woosiness!

tuesday my mother took alan and I into town and we rented a car... fuck, yeah... it's a sweet one too! 2005 Dodge Stratus. So Alan and I went to Wausau to go thrift shopping and to stop at my uncle's shoe shop to get my pink suede shoes fixed for Ireland this summer. Came back to Merrill and went to St. Vinnie's for their $5 bag sale.... sweeet! ran into Amanda MAthis AAAAAnd John Gravelle, which was nice. Then we went and waited in the High School Parking lot for school to get over and attempted to kidnap cousin Jim. Went to Jim's and shot the shit for a while with the intent to use him and Brandon for an assignment that I have.... which failed, because Brandon ended up having to go to&nbsp;work and Jim ended up falling asleep after awhile...

so Alan and I bought a shit load of cheese burgers anyway... which are still sitting in the back of the car... (I'll keep you briefed on this)

Today Alan and I went to help out my sister Mikala's teacher at Midway Elementary. We got to sit down in the library and do division flash cards individually with the kids... which was nice, because most of the kids were either in girl scouts with me, were babysat by me or I was their teacher for sunday school back in the day... so it was nice to see how they've been and see how big they've gotten.

Now we sit in the Library... I just ran into my Aunt Laurie too... it's so odd to be contantly running into people that i know, now that I have become so use to not knowing many people I run into in Milwaukee.



tonight I think we have a double date with Vanessa and Brock?

and tomorrow is busy busy.... Alan and I get to chaparone for some award pool party for the autistic kids in Merrill... then we have to go to some girl scout thing, the rapter people are coming with some of their awesome hawks and shit from antigo... and I have some more tests and shit in wausau....

I have a hole in my tit, I didn't get to keep my tumor, buuuuuuuuuuuut... I got a picture... so you can bet to see it on my myspace or as the picture of the month on my website (thesquirmingcoil.tripod.com).

"event","talked to the surgeon today and I will be getting my tumor out on thursday... meh... just a local anesthetic... I want to be knocked out completely, damn it! Cause I know once I see any blood spilling from my boob I'm just going to get seriously sick.


Biopsies on my cervix this past friday... mmm... painful...
Chiropractor later that evening... home again home again jiggity jig...

Bon fire for me on saturday night. Jeff, Jessica, her parents and brother, Caleb and Brandon all came down. Went to Rhinelander with Nessa earlier in the day to pick her bike up from camp. Went to an Antique Store and bought this adorable knitted baby cardigan with matching booties and a bonnet (yeah, way too soon for this shit, but it's one of those things that I'll never find again that I would die to put on my baby when the day comes. Plus it was cheap and my mother has been on me since I was like 12 to start up a hope chest... so... there's my start.) Good Will. Home. Food, and lots of it. 
Picked up Sarah at her home and went to Jeri's where we met Nessa and sat drinking peach schnapps with Steve watching random shows until Jeri, Jessie and Tina got back from a wedding.

smoke out

christ... haven't been that high in too long... made me sleepy... call from my baby, listened to Martha Stewart screaming in her basement, truck stop, french toast, Back to Jeri's, sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.

Then last night wasn't very eventful... salisbury steaks and tater tots for dinner, then Dad and I ran to the Gas Station to rent The Pacifier... which was actually really good for a family movie.

and now to go wait for my mother down stairs to pick me up from the library... fun..."

"event","Home was wonderful.

Having Alan back was even more so, even as short of a visit as it was.

...but hopefully I wont have to wait much longer before he's here again and  I don't have to worry about when the next time I see him will be...

mmm, my love

While home i had some doctor's visits. A breast exam to check out my lump and an ultra sound to find out that it is a tumor. There's a 95% chance of it not being cancerous as of now... but there's also a 75% chance that it could get larger or become cancerous if it's not already. 

so... i could just keep a close eye on it  so that it doesn't get bigger... or I could just get it removed completely right away.

so i chose the later

I'm going home agian on the 19th to get another colopcopy (the same procedure I had durnig spring break), then on the 22nd I see a sergeon to discuss possibly having my tumor removed on the 26th... which would leave me two days to rest before my classes begin on the 29th.

so that's what I've been dealing with lately.

but for good news... i went to the school with Angelo this morning before work to check out the used books in R45... got all my fucking books for this semester, bitches! All of them for $71.42!!! 

awesome... 

so I leave, uniform in pack, for the bus stop... bus comes super fucking early and passes me... so I start walking to work with my back pack full of super heavy books. Get to the Pabst Theater to find my side of the side walk is closed and have to cross over, look to see if bus is coming, cross street and make way down the block to get back to the other side of the street before the next 15 passes me... 15 fucking passes me... 4 minutes before I was suppose to work... the next one didn't even come until I got all the way down to Vanburen! My back hurt like shit, which caused me to get one hell of a migraine, turn up to work half an hour late and... i forgot my shoes... so... yeah... got angelo to drop them off a few hours later... live saver boy that he is... mmm...

ok... that just turned into bad news, sorry....

New apartment is awesome... nice and open, I really love it.

Got my paycheck today! mmmm... paycheck...

Sarah came over the other night and we exchanged birthday presents... we were going to go to her place.... but during the two hours that we got lost driving around trying to find our way there I got oddly ill and had to come back and she went home... not sure if she made it, but I hope she did... The whole night was just weird because I don't normally just get sick for no reason, and I ended up being sickish for most of the next day... weird cold sweats and pukey/yawny feelings in my jaw and super super sleep.... really odd."

i just

suck

yeah

I guess

meh

I've been soooo bored and lazy lately.

I work most days, but when I'm not there I just come home, and that's where I stay until I have to take bailey out to the bathroom... then I just come back in and either come online or watch t.v. or sleep... or... whatever.... bleh, haven't gotten too much accomplished this summer considering the copius amount of time I've had on my hands.

I did update my website tho... put a big dent in that on what I intend to do. updated the friend pages, photo page and que pasa page... all of which was well over due.

I'm the process of fixing my lovely pink suede shoes, which have had holes in their soles for a few months now... so to my left they sit on a chair drying.
I finally painted these two little wooden wall things, which have been sitting on my art desk to be painted since I moved in... so those are done and hung up in the bathroom.

uh... that's about all I've accomplished this summer.

I'm still trying to find a second job, but that's been a real bitch.
Have a number to call about being a home cleaner for random rich people.. so basically a maid for evenings and weekends. Which wouldn't be too bad of a job, cause I have experience with that.

Went to see O.A.R. at summerfest with Kat last saturday... which was just awesome, to say the least. When we got there, it was packed... but we managed to get on like... the eighth bench back... and in the center... which is a fucking awesome place to be considering how hard it is to even get on those damn benches. And for about half the show we were even completely  facing the stage rather than having to stand sideways... yeah! bet you didn't get a better spot.

I was supose to have this weekend off... but other people wanted to switch... so i have today, monday and tuesday off instead.
Next weekend is Dave Matthews and O.A.R.... which will be loads of fun.

Damn, I'm poor... I have... get this... ONE dollar right now. That's all I have that i can spend until monday. So... yeah... don't really have the means to buy food... so I've been living off of what food i have... a case of ramen, packages of spaghetti noodles, butter, freezie pops, nerds, kool-aid, Mrs. Grass chicken noodle soup and the german chocolate that nessa got me from germany... that's seriously all I've had to eat here at my home all week. Thank God for Subway employee meals. But come monday... hell I don't even care I'm buying an ass load of groceries with my paycheck... I'm talking steak and pototoes... shit... I just remembered I have one potatoe left in the crisper.... mmm...

In other news... Angelo, Kat and i will be moving into the new apartment in like... four weeks? And rent should be a little less next month since we're moving in almost half way through the month... and.. Alan's applying for the MKE magazine... I've been crossing my fingers that he gets hired... cause then he'd be coming back! and then possibly even living with me again.. we'll see, but hopefully.

and

I might be selling my lap top... cause I really just want to get a brand brand new one... and a powerbook at that... even tho mine's only like a year and a half old... any takers? ibook G3 for $1,000, including the apple care program, which is like $250 in it's self and the air port card... yeah... want it? huh? huh?

and... I've come to realize that the people I work with... are a little... hmm... different? maybe in a good way... we're all so different...

My head manager, Jay (aka Mr. Crab) was the ONLY employee at my subway for two years... and is the sole reason for our subways success... odd.

One of my assistant managers is a pot dealer.

Tim Knoll, one of the newer kids, headlined for a BMX show threee times a day at summerfest... and now he may be going pro? Something about taking two weeks off to do a tour for an ass load of money... crazy.

This new chick, that actually worked here previously for a year, but quit and got her job back last week... is a fetich/porn model.

Jessica, who's worked here for maybe a month or two now... I just found out that she's friends with Aandru! found this out because she was telling some story or another from high school and said that everyone called her Jox... and I'm thinking... Jox... Jox... where have i heard that name before... and then recalled a drunken phone call that aandru made to me last fall at 2AM when I had a class at 8AM about some cool chicks named Myra and Jox... so questions were asked and as it turns out... she was the same Jox chick.... small world.

Anitra is icky. she's fat, has a crazy eye that wonders when she stared at you and the grossest teeth ever. Got married right out of high school and moved up here with her husband who doesn't let her do anything. He serioudly freaks out if she's not home right after work and doesn't go to bed when he does. anyway... I guess she use to be a model too? ::shudders::: ew... and what pisses me off it that she doesn't even need this job... all the money she earns from subway is jus ther shoe money... stupid bitch... yeah... we're all trying to get her fired because we hate her so much.

bleh

maybe i'll go down town now... give angelo a call to see if i can bring my towels to wash over at the dorms and then hang out for a bit..."

me

2-9

but got out an hour early anyway.
walked home.
took dog out
got cute
walked to summerfest grounds
""cutesied"" my way up to the front of the line by sweet talking to boys
(took 10 min. to get through it! take that! other wise it would have taken more than an hour!)
met kat and her sister to see Moby
ran into Jacob, Michelle and lady friend
accidently spilled some girl's beer for which she yelled,""$4 beer, thanks a lot!"" and threw what few drops remained in the cup on to me.


attempted to find the skate boarding thing because i was suppose to go see Tim, this guy I work with because he was opening for THE TONY HAWK with his BMX goodness. but no such skate boarding thing could be found and we just ended up walking in circles trying to find it and couldn't find it one the map... so we said fuck it and walked to got watch moby.
got to the stage and slowly, but surely made our way all the way up to the 8th row-ish, yet couldn't see anything still. after an hour we decided to leave because none of us knew any of the songs he was singing and the whole time I kept on thinking,""god, I know it's been like two or three years since I've really listened to his stuff, but you'd think he'd at least play one of his old songs cause I don't know any of this shit and it just plain sucks..."" so we started walking out when all of a sudden the band started to play a famliar song and kat and amy start screaming because, christ, it wasn't moby at all, but howie day that we had been watching for the last hour.

pissed we got out of there and ran into the moby show on our way out. stayed for the last two songs, which SO out did the whole hour that we had stayed at the fucking howie day show. When we first walked up they had just started singing ""Break on Through"" by the Doors... so that was smashing as all hell.

Ma and the sisters left this morning after they dropped me off at work. 
I had really missed them before my trip
and enjoyed the time with them
but now I'm just happy to have a five hour drive in between us.

cause

shit

they treat me like shit.

Michelle and Mikala are such bitches. While Michelle was gone at camp I surprised her by completely rearranging her room and decorating it. She was so excited when she first saw it. But how did she treat me the rest of the weekend? like shit.

""Michelle, could you throw that away?""
""No!""
""Michelle, please, it's your garbage""
""Why?! What are you going to do to me if I don't?!""
""What do you mean what do I have to do to you? Why should I have to threaten  you to do something?""

Painted Sponge Bob on Mikala's wall and ""sponge-bob-i-fied"" her room, cleaned it and arranged it nice. How does she treat me? like shit.

they all messed up my apartment.
found gum in my rug
dirt in my tub
noodles mashed and dried into my carpet
broke Kat's popsicle mold thing in half
and Michelle ate the last purple pop ice

buuuuut

I did get a whole big box of the long pop ices
a 4 pack of toilet paper
a box of Finding Nemo marshmallow cereal
and a fun trip to the zoo with aunt peggy abd cousins, deedra and megan complete with train ride, sea lion show, string ray encounter and ice cream
also ran into geoff and co.
nice

"event","Somewhere toward the begining of this week my sister, Mikala and I obtained 6 itty bitty baby bunnies, all of which could fit in my two hands... (awe...) Because our family had a rummage sale, so my mom sold my sisters' play house, but when she slid it out from behind the jungle gym, yeah... whoops... there was a nest of bunnies under there and she killed two of the original nine bunnies... but we didn't even know until the day after when my dad found them mowing lawn... the seventh one went flying through the lawn mower as I was told last night.

So we had six baby bunnies... i think this was tuesday. 
and

today 


we have none

why?

cause they're all fucking dead.

how?

I dunno. They just kept dying one by one and now they're all gone. no more baby bunnies.

But I was talking with Angelo last night... and I guess he use to raise bunnies... and I guess they died because baby bunnies are extremely sensitive to heat and such... so if there is a sudden change in temperature they'll just get sick and die.

yeah... weird.
so that's why all my bunnies are dead.

This morning I had a lovely PAP.
After staying up until 1am last night rearranging my sister, Michelle's room as a surprise for when she comes home from camp today.

Tonight, hopefully I'll get to go out and play with Sarah and Vanessa!
...and now I think Jerio's coming home from Minneapolis this weekend? 

I hope so...

cause otherwise I don't know when the next time I see her will be.

I want to hang out with Brooke... but perhaps it's still too early to call her? 

bah

screw other people's sleep
they don't need it

Tomorrow is my family reunion for my daddy's side... which should be fun... as always. Sitting around, eating fancy food and seeing who can talk about them selves and their achievements the most. weee!

Christ, did anyone know that gnats bite?
They land on you for two seconds and painlessly suck your blood so that you get all these lovely chicken spot looking things all over... I look like a leper.

Last night was horrendous. I worked at subway and SURPRISE! they had me training a girl.

A GIRL WITH SEVERE ADD!!!

I haven't worked there in six months and they had me training a girl who can't even pay attention for five fucking minutes and has to go out for a cigarette every hour. 

WTF???

urgh

so I didn't get out of there until nine... when we closed at eight.

and i guess I'm getting payed under the table... but $0.50 extra an hour! woo hoo!

And this weekend I get to go ""camping"" with the family. No longer is it camping cause, fuck, it's not. We have a huge ass camper parked in a camping resort all year round about 20 feet from a heated, in-ground pool. The camper has a full kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom (with tub and shower), air conditioning/heating and full pluming. 
...when all we had when I was little was a crappy ass pop-up tent that collapsed if you touched the sides too much.

but at least there's no bugs around there."

Hung out with Sarah all day Friday. And her and Vanessa came over at night. Which was really nice.

Family Reunion was on Saturday... kinda boring... went to the mall, which was right down the street, to visit Brooke, but she didn't come in until 5:30... so I was naughty and bought the Corona purse that I had seen on Friday when Sarah and I had gone to the mall... cause I really liked it... and it was the last thing I needed to be super girly... so I got it and went and bought some sexy smelling shit from Victoria Secret's semi-anual sale... mmm.
Batteries went dead in my digital camera sometime during the reunion.
Bocce ball, horse shoes, fishing, food, done.
Great Grandma Annie's.

Tired

No going to Vanessa's camp that night.
Little sleep.

Yesterday my second cousin, Cole had his birthday party out at Jack Lake. So I went with my mother and sisters... it was decent. Good food. Got to see some cousins I hadn't seen or talken to in quite a while. nice. Got some cute pictures of the little cousins.

Home again home again jiggity jig

She picked me up.
Met Chucky and County Market.
Went to Wausau.
Walmart... where (!!!!) they have Darth Vader helmets with voice changers and breathing patterns and movie quotes and shit for $24.99!!!!! Fuck yeah! That would go perfect with the Star Wars lazer tag set Kat and I got! They also had some pretty sweet Batman masks for $2.99... and!!!! and!!! They had Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC shirts in the mens section! Jesus fucking christ! And they only went down to a Medium. Why the fuck don't they have one's in girl's sizes? I'm kinda pissed... cause they're really fucking awesome and I want one that fits me cause they're only $11.00!!!

haven't really even had much time to relax since I've gotten here.

Saturday we didn't get home until five or six, and already people were there for my mom's birthday party. So the rest of the night was spent at home mingling with the relatives and sitting around the bon fire. 

Sunday we woke up bright and early to take Michelle to the Lion's Camp. Waited in some long ass lines and got her all situated in her dorm for the week.

Monday Mother, Mikala and I went shopping in Wausau. Took Bailey with, dropped her off at Petco. to get her hairs snipped. SHopped. Picked up my bald dog. went to a park and waited while mom went grocery shopping. Got home. Sarah picked me up. Went to Travis's to hang out with him and schmunk... both of whom I haven't seen in nearly three years... so that was nice. Got trashed play a card game called mushroom. Crashed in Travis's bed with him and Sarah. Left at 5:00am. Went back to bed.

Tuesday I woke up around nine and Mom, Jeff, Jessies, Mikala, cousin Cole and I went to Jack Lake for a picnic and some swimming. Left with Jeff and Jess for some ice cream after a while. Went to work at subway from 3-8:30pm. Sarah picked me up around 9 and we met Jeff, Jess and Brandon at Brandon's house and watched Spun. Went home at 12:30.

Yesterday I went to the Weston Water Park for Vacation Bible School as a chaparone. Got tan as all hell. Serously. I'm dark. Some Kid pooped in the pool so we left. fun fun."

so i built it up
put some pictures on it
alan's only friend is his ex girl friend
so i looked at her pictures
and

blech

I'm grossed out.
i can't even imagine alan putting his hands on... it
but she's such a whore
and all alans really said is good stuff about her
she looks like a classic pin-up girl that gained about 100 pounds.
and kool-aid dyed red hair
and this huge, gross mole on her face
and creepy eye brows

so i'm going to try to figure out how to send video clips to alan through e-mail

cause i need a second job
so i can afford to visit my baby as much as i want.
and build up a good savings
i've never really been good at that...

but now i'm going to start seriously trying.

Hung out with birdie last night, which was a lot of fun.

"event","party of sorts tonight.
for
a. my birthday
and
b. alan's going away

there will be:
*a pinata
*water balloons
*pin the tail on the donkey
*a pool (small, but a pool all the same)
*goody bags
*party hats
*cake
*ice cream
*alcohol afterward if that's your kinda thing

I don't expect too many people to show up
I didn't even start planning this all out until friday
and that's when I sent out the invetations, and there were only 8
and a few call invites
but i don't think the mail man carried them fast enough
I didn't really invite all that many
cause it wouldn't have been too likely from anyone back home to come all the way here
and even if they did they'd most likely have to stay the night here with the expectations of hanging out the entire duration of the next day
which happens to be alan's last day here
so i'd rather they didn't
tho it would have been nice
I'd like to spend copious amounts of time with my baby alone for his last day

::tear::

...and I think my rent was due on the first?
I was thinking I didn't have to pay for june until july.
because i got may for free
and the landlord didn't say anything
so
i dunno
I called her this morning, but no answer
so I left a message
and i hope I don't have to pay extra for everyday late
if it's late at all

bah!

My birthday was lovely
Alan and I went to the MKE Zoo
because Six Flags didn't work out
but it was pretty fun
we saw a sea lion show!
and got a post card made of us in a photo booth
which i'lll probably copy and send to everyone
cause I haven't sent anyone any card lately
and that makes me feel like a bad friend
especially since i didn't come home this summer
After the zoo we went to go to the River Splash, but they were packing everything up when we got there
so, since we were down town we stopped at Brew City BBQ for dinner
and geeeezzzzzzuuuussss
it was delicious

Had to watch Dolche for Leah again this weekend
well
just sunday and monday
and he was pretty good
didn't piss in the apartment at all at least
which is awesome behavior when it comes to him

I currenty applying at agencies to become a full time babysitter or a nanny for the summer
cause that would pay a hell of a lot more than subway
and nobody's called me back for any of the resteraunts I've applied to
cause if they've called Jay for a reference, I'm thinking he didn't give them a good one
cause he's an ass and doesn't think I need to be working anywhere other than subway

that's it for now
roxanne just called and, yes
rent was due
so
i gotta go do that"

"event","People in milwaukee just plain suck tonight.

Alan and I went to go see Kimya Dawson play.
But we didn't get to.
But I got to meet her again!
And I got my picture taken with her.
which was pretty freakin' awesome in itself, but I really wanted to see her play.
I did see three other band preform though.

THe first guy was a little out of my interests, he was just some guy that sat in front of his laptop playing his iTunes or something in a Pikachu costume.

The second guy.. whoa... AWEsome. Everyone sat around him like it was story time and he was just singing out to us strumming his guitar. I recorded a song... so hopefully I can get it downloaded or something... but yeah he was pretty awesome.

The third band wailed. So much so that the cops came and we all had to leave because the place was a fire hazard, since there was only one exit and 40 people crowded into a cramped, sweaty basement just wouldn't do. So the show was moved to the fifth ward to Kat, Michelle, Meghan and Holly's building. 
Alan and I got on the 15 to head down there but some black guy got on and was hassling the bus driver for ripping him off and they got into a huge argument and we stopped a block away from where we got on to wait for the cops to drag him off the bus since the guy wouldn't get off himself.
So... Alan and I got off and walked back home.

But, eh... I got two of Kimya's CDs and one of her hand drawn Tshirts... which will do...
but live music from her would have been great."

"event","...so I'm dog sitting for the girl who lives in the apartment below me for the weekend because one of her sitters backed out.

so I have two cocker spaniel doggies for until tomorrow morning... since last night.

and omfg... this dog didn't sleep AT ALL last night.

I got maybe four hours of sleep?
out of the ten hours that i was laying bed?
because it kept on jumping on me and licking my face.


and it pissed on my carpet!

not once

not twice

six fucking times

and twice on the couch

and one of the times I fucking had him on the leash, ready to go out and he just decided, ""oh man, I can't wait"" and pissed while I was putting my shoes on!

(side note) Wonder Shozen on MTV2 is fantastic.

five gold stars

little girl to muppet: ""shut up hippy! you stink! go take a shower!""

(back on track) ...but the puppy is sooo cute. He's just a widdle pwuppy... about a year old... maawweeee... but I don't think it's even fully house trained, and that's why it's pissing all over the fucking place. And it didn't know any commands AT ALL. Not even down.
So i've been doing my best to teach him at least that while he's here... which... eh... half way there, listens to it sometimes. Got him to learn sit though! and got him to stay a few times. which is good.

meh... don't have off until friday... bah! but I only have to work three hours tomorrow and four hours on monday. Which is AWESOME, cause I'm beat. and TADAH, it's that super happy mega fun time of the month! weee for bloody crotches and menstrual cramps! hooray!
and my cold is back, mmm... and I was beginning to miss the taste of flegm...


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I got a new kite!

weee!

cause I had to throw all of my other three away because they were un-reparable :(
...i miss my bert and ernie kite :(....

but!

THIS kite is a big ass toucan!
and it has realistic wing flapping motion!
and a super value  200 foot of twine AND a twine winder!
it flies like a real bird!
with a 55"" wing span!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I can't wait to fly it!!!"

"event","my head manager is like mr. crabs
seriously
he even told me, ""You're wasting me money.""
...because I put fucking four pickles on a sandwich instead of three
""Rebecca, I've been watching you and you have been  putting more than the the recommended amount of vegitables on the costomer sandwiches and that means that you're using a lot of unnecisary veggies. And i'm not saying that you always do this, but if you have you're wasting me money and are lying to the customers because if we lie to our customers by not making their sandwich by the subway guidlines. If one subway makes their sandwiches with more stuff than we do, then we're losing business because the customers would much rather have more stuff for their money, and if they want to do that, good for them, but it'll catch up to them because all those viggies cost money, and they'd be losing it. If the costomers want more of something on their sandwhich they'll ask for it...blah blah blah...""

It's one extra fucking pickle, give me a break.

and the day manager keeps on trying to get me to buy a sack from him too... and he keeps on saying that he's going to smoke me up... but that hasn't happened yet... so... i dunno... but it'd be nice.
haven't even touched weed in over two months.
and it kinda sucks cause almost every day I can smell the guys in the apartment next to me smoking up... and... damn... I'd like to meed them.

Angelo is moving in with Kat and I into the three bedroom across the hall in August! wee!
so that's going to be awesome.
cause then we all get our own rooms.
and we actually have a diningroom, a living room and a kitchen instead of a kitchen,diningroom,livingroom thing.
but i'm going to miss this cozy little apartment. I've gotten really settled in here wit alan. and I really wish he could stay.... ::sigh::
but he's not leaving until after my birthday now, he's got a ticket for the 8th of June... but that's already in like two weeks.

and I cut his hair yesterday!!!
and I did a pretty good job, i'll admit. Perfectly even. and it's adorable, all of his cute little curls... awe...

...and the spice girls are reuniting? fuck that. I hope they don't come out with any new songs..."

"event","so last night i started at the subway on brady street. and i ended up going in way too early. because i thought the guy told me i had to work at six... but it was six thirty. and appartently you can only wear black pants there and i was wearing khaki... and there was no way i could get to the dorms and back in half an hour. so i called my wonderful boyfriend and asked him to grab my black pair of dress pants that were hanging in my closet and to dig around in my underwear drawer and bring a thong too, because there aren't any pockets in the back of my dress pants. 

so he comes with not my dress pair, but my work pair, which was ok. but the poor boy couldn't even tell the difference between thongs and panties. so he brought me two different pairs of panties and niether of them were thongs. 

...and i guess it's my fault, being the girl... and i don't wear thongs very often at all... so... yeah.

it was adorable, though."

eeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh..... geez... I don't know what's wrong with me lately, i've been so tired. And I'll take naps all the time and still be just as tired, if not more. Usually I'll lay down for a nap during lunch and drag myself back to class then to work. On thursdays when I don't have to work, I'll lay down after dinner and end up sleeping until alan gets back from school around midnight... mmm.... i'm a growing girl.... meh.

I really need new contacts. Sometimes I can't even read a sign ten feet in front of me, it's sad. I was suppose to go get them checked with my tax return money, but just haven't gotten around to it yet. Maybe once summer is here and I have more time i'll look into it. There's a place right on my road only like two blocks down.

god i'm lazy.

but today I am with reason. I had one hell of a busy weekend. I had gallery night on friday and the brewer game on saturday and yesterday I went to that kalahari resort all day which was awesome! around noon we all went in the parking lot and alan and greg got us all a 30 pack of busch lite, so we sat out and tail gated for like an hour, got tipsy and went back in for some more fun. Got to chill out with my baby all day, couldn't ask for a better day. truly one for those classic college moments that will stick in my mind forever. Beautiful day too, got a little tan to my face even. sweet.

oh! and i don't remember if i mentioned it or not... but kat and I signed the lease to our apartment on friday too! and we get the keys on thursday! So i'm going to see if I can get huber to bring his truck down here on friday to get my mattress and a few other large things over there, invite a couple of others and have a little house warming party before we get everything in there. Have a few pizza fries and get trashed. 

Alan's mom bought him a bottle of vodka and me a bottle of peach schnaaps... so that'll be put to use. 
Alan's mom was pretty cool. On gallery night I only had a green apple jolly rancher left in my pocket so I went to alan and said,""I'll trade you a green apple for a grape or a watermelon."" alan-""I've only got two cherries"" alan's mom-""I've got a watermelon""

awesome

ehhh.... i should get going on this history paper... it's due on thursday...

yeah

really need to update this more often...
another busy busy weekend

thursday i got me a new mattress for my futon from great lakes futon down the street.$180 for the mattress and cover... which is a pretty sweet deal... at normal prices it would have been a little over $300... so... whoo... good deal.

friday Kat and I went to go see this apartment over on Lafyatt...which.... yeah... this is the one... $550 a month for a one bedroom and only three or four blocks from brady.... awesome. not too far from school.... only a 15-20 minute bus ride...which is bearable for this price. and if we can get aaron and marshal to agreee to it... we want to move into this three bedroom one for $1125 a month in the same building... cause it's gorgeous! exposed brick! ugghhh::drools:::

so

yeah

worked

went to go see Sin City with alan on friday... geeeez.... huge line.... the theater was PACKED with comic nerds and punks... the movie was cool tho, i really like it... even if elijiah wood plays a harry potter/carlie brown looking cannibal. and while alan waited in line for our tickets i got to go to this freakin' awesome used book and music store! got me records of grateful dead - working man's dead and Jimi Hendrix's Mr. Pitiful record... which i really can't wait to hear because it has Itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini on it... and i really can't see jimi singing that... but... i dunno... maybe it'll be cool jammed... we'll see.

grecian delight


saturday

went to where Buena Cena use to be for lunch... the didn't change shit... the only thing that was different was that they had flipped the signs around. 
went to the haggerty to see 89 seconds for my history paper
flew kites in veterans park instead of going to the mam for a different history paper... but ... eh... i can go thursday...
bed

yesterday

thought i had to work at 11... nope... had to work at 10... so i called right away.... daylights savings time... already and hour and a half late.... hurried my ass up and stayed almost two  hours later... ate... got a present for michelle at borders... the witches... hope she like it... awesome book.
came home and started writing my paper and stuff. decided to give pops a call to see when he's going to come down here to see the apartment we saw on friday... which as it turns out he's not going to after all... so.. yeah... could have told the lady right then and there,""we'll take it"" but no.... anyway... hung up and right when i set the phone down on my desk it rang, expected it to me my dad saying that he forgot to say something bo no.... on the other end is an oddly familiar voice... i knew it was him the exact moment he said hey... but... never, in a million years thought it would be him... but yeah... sir matthew rethaber tis the one who called. and i'm still boggled as to why. it was a pleasant convo... and i'm suppose to call him back to see about hanging out sometime this week... which yeah... would be cool... but i have no idea when or what to do. gah
here i've been waiting for the one day when i look absolutely hideous to walk into him on the street sometime... like when i was walking home with kat from the hospital that one day with piss-stained hospital pants, puke-crusted hair that was still half-molded into the pony tail i had taken it out of, still piss-ass drunk, missing one contact and squinting like an ogar, and with a slight limp from being so freakin drunk... yeah... i just remember standing there waiting for the bus thinking,"" god... if i' were to run into someone on the street today would be the day...""

eh

enough about that i guess....

my  contact prints turned out lovely... i'll post them on my website.... you shall all enjoy i garontee.... lovely lovely
oh! and there's pics from my trip on it.... and .... whoa.... huge pupils.... 

and

i had a better break than you during class this morning

yeah

no debating"

busy week

busy busy busy

worked monday wednesday friday saturday

uh....... late classes thursday
jim came over with some crazy chocolates, which was cool
he babysat kat and i until 1:30
after taking him down and showing him out and came back up here to the fifth floor aaron said he saw alan walking around in front of the building
so i went to go find him 
and there he was when i went to walk off the elevator
and i could tell he was really worried
and i know he hates me doing this kinda stuff... but really... when was the last time i did this? and how often do i do it?
hardly ever
but he was upset non-the-less
so i felt horrible
he wouldn't even look at me
and we just went to bed
and he conked out 
and didn't even kiss me
so i rolled over and cried while i stared at his wall which was melting
and i felt everything was melting
everything
so never again my friend
not if it makes that boy upset
just not worth it to see my baby sad
but i will say... i did have a hell of a fun time before i knew just how upset he was
thought so clearly
the feeling was amazing
but never again
i can get the same affect, only much much better when i'm with him
enough said

friday i went to go see the animation show at the times theater to see alan totally geek out.
it was cute
sitting front center
awe
animation nerd
but it was pretty cool. they had a new animation from don hertzfeldt, the guy who does the animations that say,""my spoon is too big!"" and ""my anus is bleeding!""
yeah.... cool....

celebrated alan's friend, Jon's birthday on saturday night
hung out at his house 
where his girl friend made us dinner
and we had a lot of balls
of the chocolate and meaty sort
then we went and saw Constantine
which...yeah... catholic movie
wasn't bad wasn't good
all i have to say is.... what the fuck was that?
crazy crazy movie indeed

went to church yesterday morning for easter
then treated alan for breakfast again at dunkin' donuts on the walk home
mounted my prints
put feet on my chair
2:30 alan's cousin tammy picked us up and we went to get his great aunt silvia
who was most definitely crazy
and wouldn't shut up
but was adorable all the same
crazy old lady
the four of us went to alan's aunt sue's for dinner
met the grandma
met the uncle
and aunt sue and cousin tracy again
very good dinner
very good munchies
super very good dessert
i even won our game of scrabble
ha!

arguments broke out between the old ladies
and alan and i just sat in the living room trying to ignore them
and sipping white wine
and all was enjoyable
was just like easter with my family pretty much, just with a lot less people
and the fact that i had my most favoritest person in the world to share it with

::sigh::;

now time for a nap instead of working on my squid for space forms..."

"event","whoa, so, apartment stuff is going swell, actually, very swell and getting better? i'd say.

k

found one

calling them tomorrow to get a tour either tuesday or friday. $825 a month - one bedroom, one bathroom, only have to pay for gas and electric, $400 deposit, $150 amenity fee, $20 application and $300 for Bailey.... and that's all split two ways except for the dog fee.. awesome. only one problem really arose... and that's if kat gets her job a kohler this summer... which she wont find out for a couple of weeks... but if she does get it, that means, yeah, lots of money for her to pay her part of the rent but, ooo... that means she wont be living in the apartment over summer and i'd have to take on all the fees by myself for the summer. buuuut (weee!) alan said he'd take kat's spot for the summer if he stays in milwaukee... which would be flippin' awesome... me... bailey... alan... living together... like heaven and four walls yeah! but i told him to think about it cause i don't want to rush him into anything... even tho it would be pretty flippin' sweet.

so 

yeah

i'm pretty damn excited. me being little miss city girl. can't you just see me walking down the street with my cute little city dog dangling from a leash in one hand and a beach bag tight on the opposite shoulder, my cute little skirt swishing in the wind then stopping at the corner where i meet up with my hot city boyfriend and give him a peck on the cheek as we walk to the park to read books and play frisbee... ::sigh::fantasizes::

but yeah i shouldn't get my hopes that high up
but yeah
pretty flippin' sweet

went to go see the ring 2 last night and no nothing is resolved, not for me anyway. 

is she freakin' dead yet?!

the movie definitely had it's wtf moments... but it was good over all... scared me it did...

alan took me out to dinner at Mr. Pizza's which was a pretty nice place and their thin crust tasted a LOT like sam's pizza... which is a good thing. 
since alan treated for dinner i treated for dunkin' donuts for breakfast on the way home after church this morning... palm sunday... nice service... yeah...

went and visited him after work and brought him a big bag of cookies to eat while he works. So now i wait for ten to roll around when my baby'll come home and we'll get to hang out.

mmmmm"

"event","so last night was fun

went out with alan, his aunt and his cousin.
first we went to john hawk's pub for some guinness and appetizers.
wore some funny green lephrechan hats.
walked to applebees and alan's aunt bought us some yummy yummy dinner.
and... wouldn't you know it... second night in a row.. i got carded and ended up drinking soda.

blah

but all was delightful and it was nice to meet some of alan's family.

got me a new rain coat today and two cute little summer-y tank tops... mmm... yeah... one's even a little too sexy for me maybe... but it really like it cause it's really really cute so... i'm a gunna be sexy this summer maybe if i happen to grow enough balls to wear it...

uh... appartment... shit... uh... meh... so... uh... curly kat and i took a walk this afternoon instead to look for appartments... and found two... just two... so far... but that's just on the two streets that we looked... and this one seems good... because we actually got through to them... and i'm excited about it even though i haven't seen any of the actual appartments there yet... but it's right on top of the Blatz brewery and it has a freakin' pool i guess. so.... whoo! we have an appointment with them tomorrow to come see some ""luxury appartments"" that are suited for us (1-2 rooms. $1,200 a mo. max...) yeah... awesome. Not too far away either. Broadway and Highland... cool... other place we found would be awesome but i know they're going to be expensive cause it's right in the 3rd ward... actually it's just across the street above the ale house... so... mmmhmm...

that's about it...

i just got back from MIAD Idol... which was fun. some eric kid that's in one of my classes won... and with good reason... orgasmic boy with a guitar... mmm... and there were quite a few of those... and paula abdule and tina turner were there.... kinda....

yeah

awesome

and just that fact that these two guys went up and sang a phish song and played guitar rocks my socks... and derek and martin sang the gourd's version of gin and juice! smashing smashing

good day

good day"

go figure...

damn it... that's what i always get...

last night i scrubbed the entire back area at work. my boss even yelled at me for it i had done such a good job. he said it probably hasn't been that clean since they moved in seven years ago... which is kinda gross... but it was fine the way it was... there were just a few nasty corners I had problems with ever since i started there... so now they're fixed. wee. got my paycheck too... $178.00, mutha fuckas!

guess we're going to the mosaic tomorrow night... which will be fun because we haven't been there since before winter break... and going to see Robots at mayfair on saturday.... fun fun!

bah... not much else going on..."

"event","gah... by myself at last i guess... been back in good old milwaukee since friday. parents stayed at the hilton, so i stayed overnight there with them friday night... and got the piss annoyed out of me the next morning when everyone woke up at freakin' 6:00am and i had to lay there for nearly three hours for my turn in the bathroom... then waited forever once again for my sisters to be told a million times what to get done and mikala being the little bitch that she is... bah!

but i got to escaped from them for a good three hours to be in the st. patrick's day parade with alan and his hurling club. i got to walk with alan's old uniform and one of his hurling sticks and froze my ass doing so. but we got to stop and eat at this awesome german restaurant for lunch, which was really good. had a cold walk back and dawdled to go back to the hilton... finally went there and took the family to the grand avenue mall and then to borders. after taking forever on deciding what to do for dinner we all walked to the dorms to pick up alan for a night of swimming and a dinner and all i heard all the way there was,""you don't walk this at night alone do you?!""

gah!

dinner at applebee's and swimming at the hilton... well... not really swimming... more like chilling in the germ infested hot tub and posing with alan for some pictures for my mother.... i just think she wanted a pic of alan's hot bod.. mmmm.... walked home in the cold with a warm hand to hold the whole way and slept a sweet sleep to be rudely disturbed by the family once again, a call to go to breakfast... which turned into lunch because it took so long for them to drive around and decide on a place to go... and we just ended up back at McDonalds.

mmmm.... gah... the rest of this year is going to suck... i'll probably just be stuck in a constant whimsical dream of spring break the whole time... only two months left... and i get all teary eyed thinking of it cause once classes are over alan will be off to california, miles and miles away in UCLA.... and i'll still be here... dreaming away..."

"event","gah.... you people write too damn much... but... still... once i'm back in milwaukee i might attempt to read what i haven't yet...

nothing too exciting to talk about

left milwaukee at 11:45 on friday and went to manitowac with kat's family. stayed for an hour or so until sarah and brandon came and picked us up. had chinese at night. watched some freakin' awesome movies one where a man turns into a gorilla, breaks into the zoo and hits other animals with rocks. then he throws a rock at a goat and eats it. grandtastic. then it was The Maddams Family... a porno with uncle pester, cousin tit, cousin tuesday, thingy, crotch, hortisha and whatever they had the dad's name be... that was grandtastic as well... then i had them watch the good son... then off to bed, taco bell in the morning and mother picked alan and i up around 1:30. mall, red lobster, then home we went.

sunday we all went to church for girl scout sunday and then to wausau to visit aunt carol. but mum let me take the van and we went to see a lovely miss vanessa brown and the three of us got picture stickies from the mall. went grocery shopping and stayed home until this afternoon. 

i don't really know what to do with him ever... because there isn't too much to do... but i guess he's enjoying himself, so that's good... and he actually enjoys my family and such so no complaints. just having a grand 'ole time hanging out doing jack shit in the north woods...

hope everyone else is enjoying their vacations too..."

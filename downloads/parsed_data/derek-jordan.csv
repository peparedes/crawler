"event","Short day in school, Not much happened. 

EMT was long, but going and looking at all the stuff in the dispatch room was dece. I also enjoyed listening Alex make fun of Austin for his black nail-polish. But seriously EMT's shouldn't wear stockings on their arms and wear black nail-polish.

I have nothing else to say.

Side note: If the time and date is messed up on all these, its because my computers clock is messed up and I'm too lazy to fix it."

"event","School was boring today. Nothing happened. I did however enjoy laughing at Doocey because his call got canceled.

I tried to get the snowmobile started today so I could buzz around the conservation land for a while. Alas, it needs a new battery.

Between the truck and the snowmobile, it seems that the evil engine Gods have it in for me. They are up in their little lair laughing at me.

Last night I had my truck towed by AAA to my neighbors shop on Ayer road. The man with the truck was a moron, and took it to the wrong location. So I was listening to my scanner and I heard my license plate number. I called dispatch and it seems that the people who own the property where my truck was taken, called the police. Yay! gotta love AAA (btw that rhymes, I'm wicked 1337)"

"event","Well this is my second try at a live journal. My last sad attempt lasted all of around 6 posts, hopefully I will keep up with this one, but don't count on it.

Today was dece crappy, and by dece crappy I mean is sucked balls. I had to do that stupid essay thing for the troll (aka mrs.lanza), and I had to do my presentation for Mr. Foster. To say that my presentation left much to be desired, would be the understatement of the century. (ie: I did a 20 min assignment in 10, I didn't look up, and made an all around fool of myself. YAY!) But other then that I think it went well.

Other things on my shit list:

my truck is broken
I have to walk to the Fire Station every day
my parents are Nazis
my truck is broken (yes I know I already said this)"

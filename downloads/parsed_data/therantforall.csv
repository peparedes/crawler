"event","oh yeah.  i had a lucid dream the other day.  i haven't had one in years.  it started off with me eating a big mushroom.  then someone started yelling at me that they were going to kill me.  at that moment i realized that i was dreaming and could wake myself up.  when i awoke, i told myself to go back to sleep because i had told myself that i was dreaming in my dream.  i soon fell into the same dream where it had left off.  the guy was still yelling at me, but i knew that he had no real power.  i pointed at him and his head exploded.  then i hit the streets.  with my super dream state powers i summonsed a whole group of circus freaks to march behind me.  i parted cars with my will as they approached.  and then could defy the laws of gravity.  i had the ability to not only fly, but to fly through solid objects.  when i awoke, i had the biggest grin and the rest of the day was great."

i find myself at a resort type place.  there are multi level swimming pools scattering the area.  there are many people that i know there and i feel the need to avoid them all.  so i try to keep myself hidden.  people see me and start to approach, but i vanish before they can get to me.  next to one of the pools sits a group of people very dear to me around an old oak table.  everyone at the table i have much respect for.  a few are old loves that i still love.  everyone is talking about what they will do next.  ""where do we go from here.""  then i feel an uncontrollable urge to do a cannonball dive into the pool and soak everyone.  when i hit the water, however, there is no splash and though i am under water, i do not get wet.  my loved ones express that they are irritated by me trying to get them wet as i exit the pool completely dry."

The next thing i know none of us are wearing shirts.  & i'm running around his house totally topless..bra-less.  **fyi i don't remember that last part**  Paulee & Ron show up a little later.  Paulee talks some mad shyt & i'm attacking him..but he whooped my ass.  *i have my shirt on at this point*  I ended up biting Scotts hand...for why?  I do not know.  He mentioned me leaving teeth marks & having to explain to this chik he was trying to bone where & how he got them.  Hehe!  Anyways I ended up passed out on the floor next to retarded Jacob.  Which I have finally givin up on.  I think he just wants to bone me...& thats sooooo NOT going to happen.  

Anyways..off to the next night..Tnert & I go over to Garys to play some poker.  Its..Tnert, Jacob, Gary, Heather, & Blake.  ***Fast forward to many many beers later once again**  Blake asked if anyone had a long sleeved shirt.  I offered mine!  *which is totally tite on me so there is no way it would fit him comfortably*
Anyways we go out to my car & he see's it & turns my genorosity down.  Well me being drunk...I wasn't having it!  I grabbed him by the side of his pants & wouldn't let him go back to the others til he put my shirt on.  He starts draggin me down the street at 1am.  I think we got lost..or at least I was & I wouldn't let go because I thought he was going to run & leave me.  So he bitches about wanting to sit down.  So we sit on the sidewalk for a few minutes & were cuttin up & he kisses me.  !!!!  This dude is 18.  I'm 22..there is no need for that!  So I just start laughingg..which I hope didn't hurt his feelings haha!  In the end..he wore my shirt that he could barely get on.  =D  
Whew crazy weekends.

"event","OK, this is the first entry in my experimental Public Rant. I thought of this because i have never actually seen a place where it is a free thought expression zone. All i ask for is respect. I want you to realize that everyone has something to say, and now they have a place to say it. You can be anonymous, you can be named. Leave yout e-mail/IM name, or don't. The point is that it doesn't matter. Just respect. Leave the password the same, and PLEASE don't change it. This is a gift to people all across the world. It is an expression of my love and trust for beings everywhere. I am leaving the layout as the default so whoever finds this first can mold it to their liking without any sort of influence. So without further ado.....

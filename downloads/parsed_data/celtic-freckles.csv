"event","Well, I finally got a few minutes out of my bust schedule to get on line. I found out on Oct. 17th that I am having a little boy. His name is Liam Davis. It's all very exciting. We have given up on the hose hunt, as we have found a great apartment close to both of our jobs and in our price range. Life is looking a little better every day! Work is actually going great, I am finally getting the respect that I damn well deserve around there. Of course it doesn't hurt that my boss tells me on a daily basis how jealous she is of my car. Lol, how often does that happen? I can't really blame her though. I am quite proud of that sporty little power machine. Also started doing Avon, doing very well with that. I'm actually thinking of going into leadership and having Avon be my full time job after Liam is born. I would be able to set my own hours, and they offer insurance. Don't see how I could go wrong with that one. Anyway, I have some things I need to do, as usual. Maybe I'll update this thing in another 6 months. Maybe not."

"event","Well, here I am today facing another decision in my already hectic life... My boss just cornered me again this morning to ask me (again) if I would take the position of supervisor. I turned her down before when she asked me, but I am seriously considering it this time. I don't know that I really need the added stress, but I could probably use the extra money. Added cash is always a good thing when you're buying a house.I'm sure I'd make an enemy with the current supervisor seeing as how I would be taking her job, but we weren't exactly buddies to begin with. With that and Mike's recent promotion, we should be doing pretty well. I must say that even with all of the little problems and stresses of daily life, my life is pretty damn good right now. When did that happen. Oddly enough, it does take some getting used. You go from being completely miserable for years to being deliriously happy... then you're not really sure what to do with yourself. It's hard for me to believe that all of my dreams, that were crushed for the past few years, are now coming true. I owe much of that to Mike. I know that we used to have major problems, but we were both young and under tremendous pressure inside and outside of our relationship. Things are so much better than they used to be, and I am so grateful to have him back in my life. I truly believe he is my soul mate. He has become the same warm, caring, wonderful man that I fell in love with 7 years ago. Then there's the baby... I was worried about how it would affect him, but it has brought out the very best in him. I have never seen him so excited about anything before. Everything just seems to be happening so quickly these days, but I don't regret a thing.... Except, maybe, waiting so long to come back home."

     I've told everyone that I speak to on a regular basis, so I guess it's time to share the news with the rest of the world. It seems as though in a matter of less than 7 months, Mike and I are going to be responsible for the well-being of some poor, innocent child. That's right, I found out a month ago that I am in fact pregnant. Now we're buying a house together. Talk about your whirlwind kind of year. 
     Let's have a recap, shall we?

*January
   -End an unhealthy, miserable, and long-dead relationship of 3 years
   -Move back to Florida
*February
   -Begin dating high school sweetheart/first love
   -Become engaged to said sweetheart/love
*March
   -Move in together
   -Get myself out of debt
*April
   -Get married
*May
   -Go to a kick-ass Velvet Revolver concert, where I fight my way to the front and get
    about 8 feet away from the guitar-god, Slash
   -Buy an amazing, fully-loaded 2002 Monte Carlo that my boss is jealous of
   -Get pregnant
*June
   -Find myself crabbier than usual and frequently nauseated
*July
   -Find out I am pregnant
   -Go on honeymoon and meet the Jersey in-laws
   -Turn 22
*August
   -Approved for a mortgage and so the house-hunt begins

I think that pretty much brings us up to date. I definitely know that this will be a year that I will never forget."

"event","Well, I just got in from my first night back on night shift. I love it thus far, I don't have to deal with all the drama of 3-11. I did not see my co-workers for most of the night, and it was absolute bliss. I'm coming to the conclusion that I don't too much care for the human species in general these days. I hope that it is just a phase and it will pass quickly. There are very few people that I even associate with these days, not sure if it is because I'm too busy or I just don't want to put forth the effort it takes. I suppose that's all part of being a newlywed. It seems that the only person I truely long to be around these days is Mike. That is a nice feeling. It is a far cry from the screwed up romance I had with Dee. I'm not sure what it was, maybe it was the age difference between she and I. Perhaps it was something else entirely. It just seems that all we did was bring out the worst in each other. The deep burning hatred that I held for her shortly after the split is fading slowly into apathy. Does that mean that I am healing? Or does it mean that Iwas not truely ready to move on until this point. I know that I rushed into marriage with my husband, but truely I am glad that I did. He makes me truely happy, without feeling a dependance on him that I once felt. I feel that Dee and my relationship was for the best, because it made me realize how truely in love I am with Mike, and how much I have missed him. We have both grown up a great deal in the past 4 years, and I am so glad that the powers that be have brought us back together again. Ok, Ok, I know, enough with the mushy stuff. Man, I really must be tired. I need sleep....."

"event","Well, I know that I should be getting to bed soon, but I haven't been able to get sleepy. Tonight is my first night back on night shift, and I have a feeling that it will be a real bitch. Ionno, I hope that changing shifts helps the fact that I hate my job, but I have a feeling that very little will change. Oh well, if I can just hang in there until after the honeymoon and Mike gets his wisdom teeth out, it will be pounding the pavement time for me again. For all the BS I have to put up with, I may as well have a nursing home gig, and be well-compensated for all my trouble! Hopefully I will be able to start school next year and no longer have to be the pee-on in a few years. Have you ever noticed that the harder you work at a job, the more that's expected of you? Perhaps I should just start being lazy like the rest of my co-workers and then the bosses might get off my back. No, my luck that would just make things worse at this point. I HAVE TO GET OUT OF NURSING!"

"event","Just a short start.... have to get ready for work in a few. I'm tired, I'm sick, and I hate my job. I suppose everyone does on some level. Not sure why I started a journal, I guess because most of my friends have one, I was beginning to feel left out. Anyway, I'll actually put some effort into this at a later date, now I have to get ready to go to the ""employees' house of torture""."

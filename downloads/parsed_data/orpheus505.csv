"event","so, being that my best friend is the entertainment director for the new alternative nightclub, Evolution. I had the great honor and privilage of being the personal body guard for the Fabulous, CeCe Penniston. For those of you that don't know who she is, she a dance music diva from the 90's and before with her hit ""finally"". Anyways, Cece was so nice and super funny. That bitch had me rolling with laughter in the hotel VIP lounge and then again atEvolution where she performed for their pride party. As soon as I can figure out how to post the pic of me and her on Lj, you will all get to see it. Unfortunatly it was also probably the last night I'll ever do security again. Everything that could have happened, happened. Oh well I'll just stick to karaoke."

"event","I figured that since I had'nt written a post in awhile that I would take this oppourtunity to tell everyone that does'nt already know that me and <lj user=""edecho56""> are now separated and I am very unhappy that I had to do such a thing. It killed me to do so. My reasoning behind it is self improvment and in order to do so, I need to not worry that someone I love is going to have to face a very ugly side of me when they say something wrong or do something I don't like.


I love <lj user=""edecho56""> very much but right now I need to be alone with myself. I hope that friends will not judge my decision wrongly like so many have done before, and that I will still continue to be welcome. You have all been great to me and her and hopefully will continue to do so.


                  Thanx"

"event","I'm not sure I ever took the time to explain how much I hate people who take the time to involve themselves into my life. I do my best to stay the fuck out of other peoples business. I also don't appreciate people who would rather use the internet to spread slander about me rather than confronting me and saying it to my face. If you have a problem with me, please take the time to contact me and let me know. Don't be like certain people (who at this time will remain nameless) who would rather hurt the ones I love than say what they have to say directly to me. Let this be a warning to all who decide that they want involve themselves in my business, STAY THE FUCK OUT OF IT unless it concerns you directly!!! I love all my friends very much, and it is unfair for those who are loyal to have to listen to me say this.  I also understand that I am a new addition to this group and that I am not very well liked by select members. Like I said though, if there is a problem with me confront me and no one else."

My condolences to all of those who worked either retail or restaurants during the holiday season.

Anyways today I hurt my back before work and now I can't go to the wedding that I had been planning on all week. I  hope that those whose wedding it is will understand the circumstances as I am in extreme pain and not very happy right now . 
I also left early from work because it hurt."

"event","So today I gave my chef a chance to keep me as an employee. I told him I wanted $.50 more an hour an I would step up and take on more responsiblity.
Lets just say that I ended the conversation by giving my 2 weeks notice a bit early  and him telling me that I have to do what I have to do.

I'm actually glad he did'nt take my offer, I am fucking sick of that place as it is, altough I will miss all of my friends there, it was the best choice I could make for myself."

Similar personality descriptions are a plus. They both drink, so there is no incompatibility there. They are also both gamers. Both are brainy, and that is a good thing. Edris may complain that Gabriel is too sloppy. Their astrological signs are in harmony, though, which is a plus. They share a favorite season, and that is good. Their common love of animals is another good thing. And their views on children are similar. The fact that both Gabriel and Edris are somewhat dominant reduces compatibility, as opposites in this area attract. Overall, Gabriel and Edris are highly compatible. They are capable of having a beautiful relationship together. &#9829;<br><br><a href=""http://www.datingdiversions.com/dating_compatibility.html"">Dating Compatibility Test</a> on <a href=""http://www.datingdiversions.com/"">Dating Diversions</a></div></div>"

But I had a great time last night. I went to Sonny's (which is closing down next week0 and played an open mic. It was great. A feww friends stopped by to aid in the process of getting me wasted off my ass."

"event","To day at work, I told my sous chef Darren, that I was going to make a special ravioli filling to be considered for the new menu. He had known about this idea since Friday when I mentioned it to him. He said to go ahead. So today I Offered to Darren the use of the pasta I had made the day before. Every time I make him fresh pasta for his specials, He sells out. He said no to the pasta.
  Later in the day as I'm about to make my ravioli, Darren comes up to me and asks me if I could roll the pasta out for him. I assumed he was going to use it on a special.
What I did'nt know was that the special he was using it for was a ravioli to also be considered for the new menu, and he wanted it to set in the freezer by 6pm.

He had also mentioned that he was going to have the owner, who was managing that night, try this ravioli of his and hopefully swaying the owner to back him up when it was presented to the chef. 
Talk about fucking stabbing somebody in the back! I like Darren most of the time. Sometimes he takes out his fustration on me which I don't always deserve. I try and make his day a little easier by performing extra tasks for his benefit, like making fresh pasta for him, so hopefully I have at least one person who I know has my back.


 I hate the way it feels there. Its not like other kitchens I've worked in where it was like a family unit. yeah it still had its drama, but at least we still took care of each other, not stab each other in the back and talk shit about them when they are not around.


Fuck it! Its time to find a new job!!!!"

It was a friends birthday and we got  a little wild, I put a bra on my head, and threw my shirt on stage. I also sang quite a bit, from the Doors to what was  refferred to as ""The best version  of Symphony of Destruction he's ever heard"" by the DJ.

Ohand by the way my shitty sciatica has stopped hurting. Yay!"

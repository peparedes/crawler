I got back from ComCon yesterday, t'was fun.  met many interesting, people, some awesome people, some not so awesome, but mostly awesome.  Notable people include Jear, Pete, Robin, Amanda, Mike, Shannon, Shawn, Tsuki, Jim, Jim, SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHHH...............


Wow, they saved that from draft from a year and a half ago.  I can't remember for the life of me what I was really gonna post about, prolly something about gillie dying and how cool otakon is or something. meh old news.

all I really wanted to say was I was under the impression that because I have the most basic of packages from livejournal, I opted to have no advertisements on my page.  yet when I got here, BAM, friggin art institute ads and ads for drugs and all kinds of stupid crap.  what gives livejournal?

thats all.









oh and just to make a record of it, school is over and I've graduated, now I have to pay back student loans and health insurance and thats kills my paycheck, I quit RadioShack last June, and have been working at Best Buy in Cranberry for over a year now, my car's transmission died in March so I have to save up to buy a new car, I don't eat much and I run a lot so naturally I haven't lost a pound, Gillie's still dead, Otakon is awesome, and there's an 85% chance that I'm gonna be next years Chief of Staff.  fun times."

"event","My parents told me about Mr. Common Sense early in my life and told me I would do well to call on him when making decisions. It seems he was always around in my early years but less and less as time passed by. Today I read his obituary. Please join me in a moment of silence in remembrance. For Common Sense has served us all so well for so many generations.

Obituary
Common Sense

Today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, Common Sense, who has been with us for many years. No one knows for sure how old he was since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain, why the early bird gets the worm, why life isn't always fair, and how, on occasion, maybe it was my fault.

Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spend more than you earn) and reliable parenting strategies (adults, not children are in charge). His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a six-year-old boy charged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student, only worsened his condition.

Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job they themselves failed to do in disciplining their unruly children. It declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer aspirin, sun lotion or a sticky plaster to a student; but could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion.

Common Sense lost the will to live as the Ten Commandments became contraband; churches became businesses; and criminals received better treatment than their victims. Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar can sue you for assault.

Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little in her lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement.

Common Sense was preceded in death by his parents, Truth and Trust; his wife, Discretion; his daughter, Responsibility; and his son, Reason. He is survived by three stepbrothers; I Know my Rights, Someone Else is to Blame, and I'm a Victim.

Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone.

"event","short update.

my job looks like its gonna get a whole lot better.  Kirk's gone.  well, he isn't my lead anymore, and thats a win in my book.  Justin's taking over his job and things are getting better already.    More hours, a competent leader, not having to listen to Kirk ever again. I'm happy as a pig in shit.  things are definitely tarting to look up at that job, which is good.  after 2 weeks of getting less than 10 hours each, I thought the countdown to my 2 weeks notice had begun.  The sentence I used to end this paragraph sucked so I'm just gonna end itwith this one.

other stuff, I still have Will's Berserk box set.  I thought I'd just burn them and get them right back to him since anime tends to burn without any trouble usually, but these ones wouldn't burn at all with the dvd burning software I always use and the other 3 dvd burning programs I have don't compress them, so I'd have to buy dual layer dvds to be able to copy them.  though it'd be worth it, its not a wise investment at the moment what with me needing to save money up as much as I can.  so I'm watching them all.  Will, if you're reading this, I'll have em back to you by the 14th, since I leave for Canada after that.

If possible, I also want to waylay my going to Canada from the 15th to the 22nd, since rumor has it that's when my grandfather and probably my cousin chris go up if they do go up.  Then come home at the end of that week.  that way, We take someone else's vehicle up, I still get to do my security job, nearly double my bank account in three days, spend plenty of time with my family and the people up there, and be back home without missing too much.

not too much else to update on.  I need to get in contact with some of my friends that I haven't talked to in a while.


Happy 4th.  Enjoy it with the people you enjoy being with.


PS, Resident Evil 4 for the Wii is Awesome."

"event","&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; School's out, which is kind of a double edged sword.  on one hand, I'm finally finished with papers, projects, assignments, and unnecessary coding projects for three months.  on the other hand, I almost never see any of the people I've been so used to seeing every day.  I'd go out and do stuff with them but usually we would just go to the mall in between classes or hang out afterwards because we all just happened to be there.  now, it seems to get together, we need a definitive plan or agenda to hang out.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, everyone seems to be indisposed, as Dave lives two states away, Kevin had a bad reaction to bronchitis medicine and developed hives that are starting to look like boils, Nick doesn't have internet anymore since he moved so I have no idea what he's up to, Heather doesn't use her internet to communicate with people so I have no idea what she's up to plus she lives really far away and I tend to lose a quarter tank of gas every time she's involved though I don't mind, Seam tends to be missing in action half the time, and Tyler has been trying to get us all together but, like me, to no avail.  Plus, with the exception of Heather, we all work and tend to have conflicting work schedules.  Which segues into the next part.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting May 6, Mr. Sears and Mr. Roebuck have decided it would be a good idea for my team, the In Store Support(ISS) i.e. marketing, to be split up into two teams now titled ""Pricing Associates"" dividing us up into being specifically Softlines(clothes, shoes, kids, and bed stuff) and Hardlines(electronics, major appliances, tools/paint, lawn/garden, household appliances, and perfume cologne and jewelry) with me being in hardlines.  basically, the only change I've noticed so far is that now I'm not allowed to help out the people in softlines, and that the hardlines lead is an idiot.  His name is Kirk(dubbed captain kirk), and from what I've heard is he's an 18 year old twat that dropped out of high school and has no idea what he's doing.  He's said a total of 4 things to me in the 2 and a half weeks he's been there and every time I see him he's never doing anything, just sitting in the back office reading a paper or the ad.  he never gives us any instructions on what to do, and had to be told by the softlines lead(Justin, who's actually competent) that he needs to leave a list of things to do for the day when he isn't there.  I have no clue how he even got that job.  hopefully he won't be there much longer.  I guess I'll try and make the most of it.  honestly, I should tell the manager that he's an idiot and take the job myself.  Lord knows I could do it and I need the money.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that was supposed to be a short update.  oh well, guess I kinda ranted there.  in other news, both Nick and Kevin work at Sears now and in the electronics department no less.  Our schedules are bound to overlap sometime, already did once with Nick.  so that'll be nice I hope.  
oh yeah, I forgot the initial thought that led to this update.  I've noticed that I've begun to slack off at work.  not intentionally, I just notice that since the team got split up and with kirk being a stupid twat, I've had less work to do and I've begun dragging my feet a bit when getting it done.  Maybe it's because back when we worked together I felt I had this obligation to the rest of the team to do my best, or I did my best because I was part of a team.  Now, I feel nothing for this job.  By all means I don't hate it, or even dislike it.  I just feel like I've lost part of this job that made me look forward to going to work everyday.  I dunno.  comments and concerns welcomed.

Peace Out.



oh yeah, I recently gained a web domain and need to put stuff on it.  if you got any good ideas let me know. I don't want it to just be some broken link.  later."

"event","So you're really gone huh?  I remember the first time we met.  We were 6 or 7 in Pack 414 of cub scouts.  I was the fat kid, so of course I was socially castigated by everyone there, but you didn't.  you came up to me and befriended me there.  wait, sorry, I'm thinking of an episode of Full House, you were an ass, just like the rest of them.  But I suppose at some point you eased up  and became my friend.  Thanks for that.

In high school, we spent the majority of the time hurtling insults at each other though we knew neither of us meant them.  I'll miss talking about the good old days hanging out in the school library first period. and fourth period. or whenever we just needed to go somewhere.  I remember one week we watched all the old high school plays and wished we had the jackets they wore in Starmites.  good times.

The Renaissance festival where we made friends with all the actors working there.  Then Serugei invited us to watch the joust in the King's private box with his royal highness himself.  that was one of the best days of my life.

You introduced me to the world of airsoft guns, and introduced me to the ""Risk"" guys, Tristan, Will, Ben, and the others, resulting in me spending more than I ever thought possible on a ""hobby"".

I guess those days are over now.  The end of an era.  No more being regulars at Talerico's for wings every Tuesday and Thursday.  No more laughing with triumph when I stick a 14.5 mm armor piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot round into your torso in Halo.  No more bantering about how I'm fat and you're the most hideous chud I've ever met, yet you always have a pair of girls fighting over you.  You've always been around to help give me advice in your own personal idiom, usually giving the most obvious answer that no one else thought of then call me fat for not figuring it out.  Always been there to shoot the guy coming up from behind on my right when I'm pinned down by opposing fire.  You've always been around, even when I didn't want you to be.  I'll miss you buddy.  You're my best friend, and I love you.

PC Hardware:  <B>87%</B>.  not bad considering I messed up on like, 7 questions on a test because I mixed up something with UDMA.  Its a good class and the teacher is great.  I'm learning a lot, not just for my career, but also for when I finally get enough money to build my own computer.
Visual Basic: <B>8x%</B>.  not sure on this one, but it'll be at least B since I'm pretty awesome in that class.  I took VB about 4 years ago in 10th grade with Dave, Yuriy, and Joel, and it was awesome.  I'm trying to do that in this one to, make some friends in it to make the programming go by easier, and I think I'm pulling it off pretty well.  Chris is in my class, and I made friends with a few other people in the class, like Andrew, Will, and Sean.  That class is just fun to go to.
CCNA Networking:  <B>91.55%</B>.  ok, this grade is awesome and you should be impressed.  Networking is by far my hardest class and its the one I'm doing the best in.  Networking is a twisted web of terms, cables, wires, and specifics that have been very taxing on me this year, but if I'm pulling an A out of it then I guess its worth it.
Intro to I.T. AKA Your Friend, the Word Processor: <B>82.8%</B>.  By far my easiest class, yet the one I'm doing the worst in.  Reasons for this include the dumbest 50 dollar program that doesn't work that wastes 3 gigs on my computer.  There was a test earlier in the year on explaining how to use it.  I couldn't do it since the program just loopbacks to the front page every time I click on something.  I asked the teacher numerous times and he just says to call their tech support.  anyone that knows me knows I <I>hate</I> tech support.  I hate the people that just sit around answering phones and try to fix your computer with the information they got in their two week training course prior to working there.  that or its some guy in India getting paid 10 bucks a week telling me to see if my computer is plugged in.  fuck that.  anywho, if I did in fact aced that test(which I totally would have), I'd be getting an 87%.

So those are my current grades for the 2006 fall semester.  Let's hope I can keep it up.

Jade Falcon1337: I really do miss it.  Not just the friends, but things like us BSing in homeroom, Mr. Hess's insatiable distaste for students and teaching, Mr. Tkatch telling us how to cheat on our taxes, adding new students like Harry Potter and Snake Plissken into the school, complete with a homeroom and a class schedule (Plissken played flute lol), my ""Breakfast Club"" group of sorts in the library first period, cutting a study hall and getting in-school suspension for it.  I want those times back.  and if not, times like those again.  College was a whole bunch of new experiences, some good, some bad, some very bad, and some so great I'll never forget them, but it wasn't like my times at Ambridge.  As much as I say how I hated that place and how dilapidated it is, I love that school.

"event","So summer's almost over and I have $300 dollars (worked a security job for a weekend) and a lifetime of memories to show for it.  I didn't mind going up to Canada all summer....  scratch that.  I minded the hell out of it.  Especially last year.  I hated the thought of not being able to spend my last high school summer with my friends, not be able to reminisce with them about memories that I would have been a part of, and not to have been able to tell that special someone just how much she meant to me and to spend my last summer with her, even if she didn't return my feelings.  It was my last chance.

But that was last summer, and it wasn't like I went to a prison camp or anything.  I made a lot of new friends up there and made a lot of good memories.  and was reunited with them again this summer, and managed to make a few more friends along the way.  It wasn't so hard this time since I had started a new beginning at the end of last summer.  

I went to Slippery Rock University and majored in computer science.  Boy was that dumb.  The program was sketchy, and I was only able to take one computer class per semester for the next 4 years. If you knew me in high school, you'd know that I like my computer classes.  I took every one available in the school.  But I guess it doesn't matter now.  I did something stupid that I won't say here, but it involves my next post when I make it(Edit: or the one after that since I wrote something I want to post in here before I managed to write the other one.).  because of that event, I'm not allowed back for a little while.  But, no matter.  

It was probably the best thing that could have happened to me.  I'm now no longer going back to SRU.  I'm now going to CCBC and unlike Slippery Rock, I am taking 4 computer classes.  I'll be sort of returning to my old life, seeing my old friends, starting over, though it won't be where I left off.  I didn't realize it until a while ago, but I've apparently grown up a lot this year.  Smarter, wiser, more confident, and I know I'm not the only one.  Everyone else I haven't seen for a year has grown up too, and I wonder how much everyone's changed, hopefully not too much or for the worse.

I biggest worry is that even though I want to see them all again, I left them.  they all still had each other, why should they be interested in being in my life again, after I abandoned the best thing I ever had in pursuit of higher education?








Because I'm awesome.  That's why.

Peace out."

I couldn't believe they had sent me a microprcessor, much less the same model I am currently using.  I told nick and his response was: ""pics or it doesn't exist.""  So thank him for making me take the pictures.  this was unbelievable.  Most of you reading this are probably thinking ""So what?  it's just a part of a computer.  calm down.""  and you're right.  But it was just so un-freaking-believable!!

so that's my story.  that was on Tuesday.  Today I went to my two sisters singing/keyboard recital.  It was 4 hours long.  that was a little too long.  I saw Stuebes, and he was rocksome.  I saw Emily's sister Bethany there but not Emily, which is too bad because I was hoping to see her.  after that I went to my cousin Gary's graduation party.  Briefly.  won't go into that.  That was the extent of my day, all in all, a pretty good day.



Edit:  Oh, yeah, I forgot.  starting today I'm gonna let you all know what my desktop background is.  no real reason.  just something to do.  I usually change then every week or so, though this one has been up for almost a month, since I like itand I haven't found anything else better as of yet.  It's a screenshot from episode 9 of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/NGEEp9ShinjiandAsuka.png"">Screenshot.</a>

If for some reason you want the picture in desktop size, in my AIM name, Jade Falcon1337, right click my name and go to get file.  it should be available in there. along with some other stuff.  My resolution is 1280 by 1024."

"event","Wing night was awesome.  Nick wasn't depressed at all which was good and today he went to CCBC and applied for college, took a placement test, and is all but registered for college.  Woot! that's a good thing.  Anna messaged me which was cool since I haven't talked to her since Sunday, April 30 at 12:28:33(gotta love log managers) but alas, she messaged me like, 3 seconds before I left for wings and I was already running late.  so Anna, next time you're on, message me!  absolutely nothing else happened to me today, unless you count me putting a bunch of stuff on discs because I ran out of room on my hard drive again.  80GB is just not enough.  I'm working on it though.  Also working on building my new computer.  It's gonna be awesome.  It's gonna be unbelievable with the <a target=""_blank"" href=""

Someone said that this processor has a little bit of Jesus inside.  That one costs $357 but I'm awesome and know someone who might be able to get me one for $200. Which will kick ass.  a lot.  Because that'll leave me enough money to buy some kickass 2GB of RAM. Prolly some Corsair memory, because they are gods and will get my DVD drive to shoot freakin rainbows out of it.  I'll probably let you what the stuff is that I get as it comes in.

"event","It's like 4 something in the morning and I just watched the live action Sailor Moon.  OH.  MY. GOD.  I don't know what to say about it.  it was so awesomely bad yet I downloaded another episode of it.  There's just something about teenage Japanese girls fightg monsters in skirts that makes it so great to watch.  Which brings me to my next topic.  I LOVE ASIAN GIRLS.  they are the embodiment of perfection.  They're cute, smart, funny (either by being witty or ditzy) and they are still so great looking 30 years later.  Asian guys don't deserve them.  plus they cheat at video games, using math or some shit.  

Anywho, this here is an honest attempt to start blogging again, since I have nothing better to do with my life now that school's over.  I leave for good ole Mattawa, Ontario around the middle of June.  As a change from last year, insted of going up for the entirety of the summer until band camp, we are going up for three weeks, then heading home for 10 days, then back up there again for three more weeks which brings us to the start of Carolyn's band camp.  

I don't really have anything to do since no employer will hire someone for two weeks, so if anyone is up for doing anything, we gotta do it before the 12th of June, and I miss you people so let me know.  seriously.  I've been bored off my ass since I got back from college and need social interaction.  I'm beginning to develop Asperger's Syndrome here.  I am having a wing night tomorrow err- today with Nick but he's acting really depressed lately so I dunno how much fun that'll be, but it's better than sitting around inside all day.  

I've been watching a lot of anime and playing a lot of video games since school ended, as well as watching That 70s Show season's one and two.  I enjoy That 70s Show, and that's coming from someone who usually doesn't like to watch sitcoms.  It's funny, clever, realistic, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is an all around great show... so far.  if I remember correctly, most shows start going downhill if they haven't already (Joan of Arcadia) at season 6.  Luckily, I'm nowhere near that yet.

New Super Mario Bros PWNs.  I love that game.  I played it constantly the week before it came out.  what's that?  Yes, you read it correctly.  The week BEFORE it came out.  If you don't know, though you should, I got a Nintendo DS back in I think November along with Super Mario 64 DS and My first import game Jump Superstars.  After school started up again in January, I discovered that it was possible to hack the firmware of the DS and along with a device called the Supercard, you could download NDS and GBA ROMs onto an SD card and play them on your DS as if you actually owned the game itself.  but it didn't stop there.  you can also play music files, view jpegs, and watch movies on it as well!  In your sleek and beautiful face PSP.  there are also groups of independent programmers that design homebrew code for the DS and letting you run their programs on the DS.  Naturally I took advantage of this immediately and hacked the DS and boguth the Supercard from China (since it's illegal in America).  What was I talking about?  oh yeah, getting NSMB early.  there's this site I go to, DGEmu.com and it allows me to download various ROMs.  Well, somehow they got The New Super Mario Bros earlyand I grabbed that immedialy and played that thing all day.  It's just reat, classic mario with some 3D thrown in there and new levels.  i love it.  I also got Kingdom Hearts II for the PS2 the day it came out and played that for around 50 hours so far.  I'm trying to level up my character so I can fight Sephiroth now.  currently at level 67, totally getting my ass kicked every time.  It's a great sequel to the first with new worlds and a few of the old ones.  Although they took out a lot of the elements that made it an RPG and more of an adveture game like Legend of Zelda.  It's still a great game and I highly recommend it though if you haven't played the first one, then play that one first.  Chain of Memories is unneccessary but helps explain things better.  I've also played some other games but they are just retro games that I haven't picked up in years.  Last thing in this, if any of you have an old Nintendo PowerGlove and don't mind selling it to me dirt cheap, let me know.

As for anime, I currently have around 50 some series, and have watched around 40 of them.  College has been good to me.  the ones I have watched in the past week or three are: Midori no Hibi, Mai Otome, Gunslinger Girl, Mahou Sensei Negima, FLCL (again), Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG, I My Me!  Strawberry Eggs, Angelic Layer, Gravitation, and Noir.  wow.  Writing them all out now makes me think I watch too much anime.  oh well.  they are all great series and you should go see them.

I'm currently looking for the Trigun Maximum Manga online.  legal or otherwise.  preferrably otherwise.  If you're bored or feel like helping me out, look into that.  the manga go much, much, MUCH more indepth than the anime ever did.

so it's now 5 something and I should prolly head off.  I'm not gonna ask you to leave feedback because it would probably only disappoint me, but if you feel like it please do.




Peace out."

I'm at work.  I'm bored.  and I'm getting paid seven bucks an hour to do this.  It's almost 11:30, and I have College Writing I homework to do on sports... a subject I <I>hate</I> writing about.  I guess it's better than what we've been having to do.  I've had to write three papers on minorities and how unfair they are treated and how insular America is and how white people are the devil.  I'm sick of this woman.  I'm seriously considering writing a really nasty letter telling her how much I can't stand her and all of her racism and discrimination.  In fact, instead of giving it to her, I should give it to the Dean.  i'm sure he'd love to know that he is employing a woman who is trying to convert all of her students into the Black Panthers.  Seriously, this woman has no business teaching at a university.  This no place to push America hating ideals on people.  If you wanna do that, then go to Iraq... or Iran, North Korea, India, France, Saudi Arabia, Lebannon, China, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Germany, and what's left of Palestine."

"event","I just had a realization.
I take a few history classes.  In them, I learn about history, hence the title of the class.  I learn about all these different kingdoms and empires and hear about these kings and pharaohs and emperors and what they did.  Then it hit me.  These men were like gods to these people.  people worshiped them.  They were the most important person in the world to millions.  And now, what did they leave behind?  All they had to show for everything they have done to and for this world has been reduced to nothing.  All that's left of there legacy is a professor mentioning their name and some students writing down one or two lines about the most important thing they did for a test and then they are gone for our memories as quickly as they came in.  And these were  the kings, the leaders.  Billions of people are not even mentioned throughout history.  Is this what I am going to be reduced to?  After I'm gone will anyone even remember me?  ""If you don't remember something, it never happened. If you aren't remembered, you never existed.""

In the end, all that matters is what you've done.



What have I done that is worthy of remembrance?  

What will I do before the end..."

Dear Mr. Bush:

Any idea where all our helicopters are? It's Day 5 of Hurricane Katrina and thousands remain stranded in New Orleans and need to be airlifted. Where on earth could you have misplaced all our military choppers? Do you need help finding them? I once lost my car in a Sears parking lot. Man, was that a drag.

Also, any idea where all our national guard soldiers are? We could really use them right now for the type of thing they signed up to do like helping with national disasters. How come they weren't there to begin with?

Last Thursday I was in south Florida and sat outside while the eye of Hurricane Katrina passed over my head. It was only a Category 1 then but it was pretty nasty. Eleven people died and, as of today, there were still homes without power. That night the weatherman said this storm was on its way to New Orleans. That was Thursday! Did anybody tell you? I know you didn't want to interrupt your vacation and I know how you don't like to get bad news. Plus, you had fundraisers to go to and mothers of dead soldiers to ignore and smear. You sure showed her!

I especially like how, the day after the hurricane, instead of flying to Louisiana, you flew to San Diego to party with your business peeps. Don't let people criticize you for this -- after all, the hurricane was over and what the heck could you do, put your finger in the dike?

And don't listen to those who, in the coming days, will reveal how you specifically reduced the Army Corps of Engineers' budget for New Orleans this summer for the third year in a row. You just tell them that even if you hadn't cut the money to fix those levees, there weren't going to be any Army engineers to fix them anyway because you had a much more important construction job for them -- BUILDING DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ!

On Day 3, when you finally left your vacation home, I have to say I was moved by how you had your Air Force One pilot descend from the clouds as you flew over New Orleans so you could catch a quick look of the disaster. Hey, I know you couldn't stop and grab a bullhorn and stand on some rubble and act like a commander in chief. Been there done that.

There will be those who will try to politicize this tragedy and try to use it against you. Just have your people keep pointing that out. Respond to nothing. Even those pesky scientists who predicted this would happen because the water in the Gulf of Mexico is getting hotter and hotter making a storm like this inevitable. Ignore them and all their global warming Chicken Littles. There is nothing unusual about a hurricane that was so wide it would be like having one F-4 tornado that stretched from New York to Cleveland.

No, Mr. Bush, you just stay the course. It's not your fault that 30 percent of New Orleans lives in poverty or that tens of thousands had no transportation to get out of town. C'mon, they're black! I mean, it's not like this happened to Kennebunkport. Can you imagine leaving white people on their roofs for five days? Don't make me laugh! Race has nothing -- NOTHING -- to do with this!

You hang in there, Mr. Bush. Just try to find a few of our Army helicopters and send them there. Pretend the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are near Tikrit.

Yours,

P.S. That annoying mother, Cindy Sheehan, is no longer at your ranch. She and dozens of other relatives of the Iraqi War dead are now driving across the country, stopping in many cities along the way. Maybe you can catch up with them before they get to DC on September 21st."

There are thousands dead and dying out there and a lot of bad shit is happening to those people.  I've experienced a small taste of what these people are going through, but my experiences are incomparable to this.  Do what you can.  If you're in the area, help these people in whatever way you can.  If you're not in the area, <a href=""http://www.americares.org/default.aspx"" class=""instantlink"" target=""_blank"">donate</a> <a href=""http://www.directrelief.org/"" class=""instantlink"" target=""_blank"">money</a> to a <A HREF=""http://www.unicef.org"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none"">reputable</a>
 <a href=""http://www.redcross.org/"" class=""instantlink"" target=""_blank"">organization</a> or even better, <a href=""http://www.bungiestore.com/productcart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=322"" class=""instantlink"" target=""_blank"">buy this shirt</a>. If you're a college student who can't afford much, please donate five or ten dollars, because honestly, every little bit helps.If you're a reporter sitting behind a desk brimming with happiness because of this because it'll help your ratings, go donate all the money you have, then kill yourself(Thanks <A HREF=""http://www.illwillpress.com"" STYLE=""text-decoration: none"">Foamy</a> for this group of bastards).  If you're George W. Bush, get off your fucking ass, stop flying over New Orleans to look out the window at the disaster, take some fucking authority, help some fucking people, then fucking kill yourself and give this country a fucking competent president for the first time in five years.
To all of the people who have done something, thank you.  I'm gonna buy you a pizza.  To those of you that haven't, please do.  you'll feel a lot better about yourself.  Really.  

That's all for now.  I'm gonna go help people.

Here's a list of reputable organizations that I've posed links to.

"event","For those of you who have been living under a rock, have no interest in my life, have Alzheimer's disease, or are just stupid, I somehow got into college.  I go to Slippery Rock University and I major in computer science.  I moved in a few days ago.

I couldn't sleep the entire night before.  one, because I wasn't tired, and two, because I had just realized that I was leaving.  for good.  All my friends, my family, my dog.  I miss my dog.  I'm leaving everything I have built up for eighteen years.  Oh well, we all gotta grow up sometime.

I arrived at Slippery Rock at 9:17 AM on Friday, August 26, 2005.  It was hectic.  We pull up to my residence hall, named Bard(DnD reference maybe?), and a bunch of people in bright yellowish green t-shirts come up to our car and start grabbing everything they can out of there.  If you know me, you know I'm a little self conscious about people touching my stuff, especially strangers.  in a shirt so bright you can see it a half a mile away, day or night.  After that,  it gets even better.  They make me leave all of my stuff, just lying there in the yard, totaling well over $1000 in value, and go wait in line for a half an hour to sign in.  Getting paranoid at this point, I sign in,  my dad has gotten back from parking the car, and my cousin Chris arrived to help me carry stuff up.

Miraculously, nothing of mine got stolen.  We head up to the room, and we find out that my sister Mindy's room is bigger.  and she's living alone.  and she gets a comfy chair.  We bring all of my stuff in, rearrange some stuff, and make the play habitable.  The roommate's not here... yet.  I hooked up my computer and immediately wept(really, I wept) at the speed of a fiber optic T3 connection.  Especially when no one else had their's hooked up yet because people are stupid and think that the internet just magically appears in front of them on their computers without ethernet cables.  Idiots.

My dad goes off in search of a screwdriver because the room isn't designed very well, and Chris and I goof off and make impersonations and stupid stuff like that while I unpacked my stuff.  My dad came back after a long ass time.  If you don't want to read about my dad's journey to find a screwdriver, go to the next paragraph which is a good bit and has my roommate in it.  First, he went to the CA(community adviser) of my floor, and was told to go to the front desk person.  So he goes down there, stands in line for a while, and then that person says that she has no idea what he's talking about, and that she doesn't have one.  So my dad leaves and decides to go to Dodds, the residence hall Mindy is staying in to get her screwdriver.  He goes in and gets locked in the stairwell.  Why he was using the stairs to go up to the seventh floor is beyond me.  He should of just bummed a ride on the elevator.  Anyway, someone finally lets him out, and he goes to Mindy's room and wait a little while for her to show up in the hall.  If you didn't know, Mindy's a CA, so she's busy on moving day, but she gets to stay free and gets her own room.  I've already started filling out the appropriate application forms.  anyway, getting back on track,  My dad asks Mindy for a screwdriver, so Mindy goes to look for it.  Then she realizes that she let the CA of another floor borrow it.  So they go down and get it, my dad leaves, Mindy says goodbye, and my dad returns to the room.

Now my roommate shows up.  His name is Jamie, he's a political science major, a republican, from York, and drove quite a way to get here.  I'll do a full analysis of him later.  He arrives with his mom, his step-dad, and his aunt.  It's at that time my dad and my cousin decide to leave me.  Idiots.  They should no better than to leave me in a small room with four strangers, one of which I'm going to be living with for a year. Oh well.  As soon as my family leaves, they begin to undo everything we had done and rearranged.  I was powerless to stop then since I was outnumbered and didn't feel up to a fight the first day.  After a while(or longer), his family left.  We got acquainted a bit, then went to the mandatory floor meeting.  Our CAs told us the basic rules:  (really what they said, I didn't make it up in an attempt at humor)
If you're gonna drink, don't let us know.  Otherwise we don't care.
If you're gonna smoke, do it outside.  It's a great way to meet people. though we don't encourage you to start smoking to meet people.  there are other ways.
Don't smoke pot, but since you're gonna, there's actually an official hill to smoke pot behind, Ganga Hill.
Guests.  Female guests can stay in the dorms until 2:00AM. After that, if you can get her to go to the car, go for it.  Again, not really strict, If your roommate doesn't mind, neither do we.

They're nice guys.  A little rough around the edges, but still good people.

I had dinner with my roommate.  The cafeteria is like Ambridge cafeteria in heaven.  Damn good stuff all over the place, and it's unlimited.

Then came the part that made me want to quit school and enter the workforce.  They had a pep assembly.  A goddamn pep assembly in college.  If I wanted to be forced to meaningless assemblies that do nothing but idolize and celebrate barbaric displays of outdated masculinity(football, if you didn't know), I would've stayed in high school.  After an hour and a half of bullshit, It got a little better, then bad again.
They had a casino night at the Union.  It was actually kinda cool.  A lot of cards, roulette, slots, and a variety of mixed drinks(non-alcoholic of course...dammit).  The really bad part about it was that it was way too crowded.  You couldn't play anywhere because it was so full.  I left early because I hadn't slept since 10:00 AM Thursday morning.  I was going to go to bed, but got a little caught up talking to Brittnie and listening to techno trance music.  Then I went to bed.

It was a pretty good first day, but I didn't meet very many people, but other than that, it was good.
I gotta go get some sleep now.  
later.

Wednesday, August 10, 2005
First, we left Canada four days early for reasons I still don't understand.  I guess it had something to do with getting ready to re-enter reality.  Anyway, after a long and stressful 12 hour, 573 mile ride back home, I return to find myself shocked.
I walk inside and immediately start to go downstairs.  Well, actually, I brought in my stuff that I had brought into the car with me(Game Boy, MP3 Player, a book or three) and put them in the living room.  THEN, I immediately go downstairs.  I then discovered that my room is infected with mold.  My air conditioner was left in and with all the heat and humidity this summer, plus the fact that my room is in the basement, my bed frame and headboard(which are made of wood for those of you who haven't seen it) as well as the baseboards were riddled with mold and it looked like it was starting to spread to the bottom of the drywall.  I am currently sleeping in the living room.  Again.  Last September I had to live in the living room because the hurricanes flooded my room and all of my worldly possessions were destroyed, in case you didn't know.
On top of that, my fish tank's filter was filthy, like it hadn't been changed in a month(my parents cam home a month ago after they went to New York impulsively when they won David Letterman tickets), the water level was down to about half a tank, and two of my fish were dead. A goldfish and a black tetra.  We've tried calling my neighbors that were taking care of everything, but they're the type of asshole people that don't answer their phone so they can hear who it is on their answering machine.  If you're one of those people that do that, hit yourself very hard with a hammer, mallet, or sharp object until you are unconscious.  I'm using the honor system here so don't disappoint me.  Anyway, They never answer their phone and that pisses me off.

Thursday, August 11, 2005
The next morning I go out to see my pride and joy, one of the most strenuous and time consuming projects I have ever undergone: The Pond.  I walk outside and suddenly a grimacer look stretches across my sullen face.  The water was all but gone, the filter was knocked on its side,the fish were miraculously alive(though I never knew the exact number of fish in my pond), and almost all of my water plants that were in there are all shriveled up and dead.  Anything that was floating on top(like water lilies, not dead leaves) or that was a big plant looked as if someone threw some kind of plant killer on them.  Basically, 97% of my plants are dead.  The only one that survived were the young seedlings on the bottom that were recently starting to bud... in summer.  It's usually spring that they do that but I wasn't think ing of that at the moment.  All I had on my mind at that moment was that I had to save my pond.
Under a considerable amount of stress, I thought I did a fairly decent job at it, although it looks nothing like it used to.  Kind of reminds to of the people trying to rebuild after the tidal wave in the Indian Ocean.

Friday, August 12, 2005
Woke up at 8:00 in the morning and went shopping for clothes for college.  I actually spent a lot of money this day  I'm usually very frugal in life, but that day I went and spent about a hundred dollars.
After shopping we went to my grandparents and took my grandma to the hospital and stayed there until about 10:30 PM.  She's dying...

Saturday, August 13, 2005
Not too much happened today except that I finally continued and finished scrubbing down every inch of my room and furniture with bleach to get rid of all of the mold.  Its a lot more work than it sounds.  I had to take apart my entire bed which is about four eight foot pieces, six drawers, two four foot pieces, and a massive headboard.  That day sucked.

Sunday, August 14, 2005
Today was freaking awesome.  But I'll tell you about that later.  I'm really tired right now.  it's 3:42AM.  Good Night."

"event","Hi.  Me again.
First off, yes.  I know I spelled three wrong in the subject.  It's intentional.  But since no one noticed it anyway, I just wasted my time.  It seems many Americans think that all Canadians are tree-huggers.  That is a load of bull.  Since I've been here I've only seen maybe 78% of them hugging trees.(This is a poor attempt at a joke the sounded good in my head but sounds really stupid when written down.)  Also, look how cute the penguin is when its jubilant.  Penguins are cool.

Now, what I've been up to for a while.  My cousins Chris and Cathy came up here as well as my grandparents.  We held a small birthday party for Cathy because she turned sixteen.  
Today was another trip to town, with me, Mindy, and Chris.  Not much else to say.  Or not much else I'm going to say.  Other things have happened that you just don't need to worry about.
This was kind of a waste of a log, but at least you all now know I'm not lying in some ditch at two in the morning on the side of the road drunk like I was certainly not doing about tuesday last week. er... I gotta go."

"event","Hi again.  First off, still hot.  still sucks.
Now that that's out of the way, let's get everybody up to date on what has happened.
First, I broke someone's nose.  Well, made it bleed anyway.  I was skipping clams in the lake and accidentally let go too soon on one of them and it flew out of my hand and hit Jessica, a 16 year old girl whose nose I just pelted a clam at.  I apologized profusely, and she knows it was just a mistake.  She's probably pretty annoyed by now at how many times I've apologized.
Anywho, that happened on the 12th.  Yesterday, we all had a large clay war.  Basically, it was a big war with gray mud that hardens quickly.  And it stinks like nothing you could possibly imagine.  Well, maybe you can.  probably.  Anyway, it was guys against girls.  We came. We saw. We stunk.  Barret (another person there) was covered in it head to toe.  But we still won.  And we still stunk. 
Today, I went into town and wrote an entry in my LiveJournal account.  One, because I want all my friends to know what I've been doing, and two, it's air conditioned here.

Well, that's what's been happening recently.  We aren't allowed to have campfires anymore until this heat wave subsides, because forest fires are a real threat around here.  My cousins Chris (21) and Cathy (15 turning 16 this month)are coming up this weekend, so that'll be a fun change of pace.  The weekend after is Voyager Days here in Mattawa.  It's like Nationality days is Ambridge but cooler because it's in Canada.  and there's Indians.

That's about all for now.  I'd like to know what you're all doing, so comment and tell me about it if you feel like it."

"event","Hello!
I doubt anyone is even reading any of this, but this is the first time I've gotten onto a computer for a long time.

I'll give you the short version because I don't have much time.
It's alright here in Canada, although the closest town is a 40 minute drive away.  I've met a lot of new people that are a lot cooler than you.  I've spent most of my time fishing, boating, swimming, drinking, hiking, climbing, looting, pillaging, and sacrificing the blood of the innocents.  The place I'm at now is a small library with computers even worse than the ones at school.  The town it's in is Mattawa, population 2,500.  It's actually a really nice place.  It's small, but homey, the people are all very friendly and welcoming.
The temperature is 40 C, which is roughly 110 F.  It's hot. It sucks.

gotta go.  I'll write more when I get the chance.  bye..."

"event","For those of you who live under a rock, the movie Napoleon Dynamite was a movie that you either loved or hated.  I, personally, thought the movie was alright, but I feel that I is WAY overquoted.  So, for those of you that Hated Napoleon Dynamite, I came up with this remake that is guaranteed to win every single Academy Award... except for that screenplay adapted from a book one.  Not that one.

Now, I present you with:

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/NapoleonDynamiteReloadedLogo.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/Napoleon.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
This is Napoleon Dynamite. He dies at the beginning of the film... Because he is a loser.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/Rambo.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Rambo saw that Napoleon was a loser and needed to die. So he took an M-60 and fired until Napoleon exploded.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/TheGodfather.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Rambo had been ordered by the Godfather to destroy Napoleon. He was so pleased by Rambo's work he ordered Rambo on a secret mission.
<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/DeathStar.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Rambo was to infiltrate the Death Star and destroy its evil owner.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/Sauron.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

It was the dreaded Dark Lord Sauron That was behind the Death Star. GASP!
And the inside of the Death Star apparently looks like a German airport.  And yes, even Sauron has to wear a name tag.

Rambo knew he needed help. So he called his old friend, Snake from Escape from New York and LA.

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/SnakePlissken.gif"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


Rambo and Snake made their way secretly through the vast death star, searching for Sauron. They made their way into a command room where they thought to find Sauron, but it was a trap! Sauron knew they were coming and sent his lieutenants Go Go Yubari and Steve Urkel to bring them down!

<img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/GoGoYubari.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com""><img src=""http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y8/Jadefalcon1337/Napoleon%20Dynamite%20Reloaded/SteveUrkel.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

Snake went after Urkel and Rambo went after the hot Japanese Schoolgirl wielding the mace. I think Rambo got the better of that deal.  Anyway, Urkel pulled his pants up even farther and started acting really annoying, putting Snake at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, Rambo was dodging blows from the Mace while spraying wildly with his M-60. Urkel was pressing in on Snake when he decided that since he had escaped future New York and LA, he could take Urkel (who lived in future Chicago). He smashed Urkel in the face, and then pulled his pants down to his knees, bringing him into the current fashion style. Then he switched his eye patch to his other eye and threw Urkel into the power generator.

Rambo was still having problems with the school girl, but nothing he couldn't handle. Since Rambo is fricking invincible, he started taking the mace blows on his size of Indiana chest.

Go Go realized she was going to lose, so she started crying and then Rambo caught her off guard and blew her up.  How he did that nobody knows.  He is also a magician. see look!  He is now a Cartoon Leopard!!  MAGIC!

Rambo and Snake then made their way into Sauron's command chamber. Sauron only laughed and told them it would be the end of their precious rebel alliance and the ring would soon be his. Snake and Rambo were like, ""WTF?"" before Rambo blasted Sauron with his M-60 and Snake did something else that was violent. The dust cleared and Sauron was gone. Snake and Rambo turned to leave, but they heard a cackling laugh coming from behind them. They wheeled to see not Sauron before them, but the Wicked Witch of the West!

The Wicked Witch laughed evilly and explained that it was all a plan to get those damned Ruby Red Slippers from Dorothy and that Rambo and Snake were the only ones keeping her from that goal. Both Rambo and Snake thought Judy Garland was a nice actress (and that her 40's collaborations with Mickey Rooney ruined her career) and refused to get out of her way. Rambo, now being a magician, turned the Wicked Witch into Mr. Burns.  Angered, the witch sent forth her flying monkeys. ""Fly forth, my pretties!"" she cackled.

Rambo and Snake easily dispatched of the monkeys and confronted the witch once more. She laughed and told them they couldn't possibly win. Rambo fired his M-60 into the drinking fountain, causing it to explode. The water shot outward, covering the witch in water. ""I'm meltingggg!!!!"" she screamed.

With the Witch Destroyed, her evil Death Star started to collapse. Snake and Rambo knew they couldn't escape on foot in time, so Snake called up Ernest Borgnine from Escape from New York to drive them out.

Ernest forgot his cab, so they had to take a bus out of the Death Star. The problem was, there was a bomb on the bus, so they couldn't go under 50 m.p.h.

The bus made it out just in time. The Death Star exploded just as the bus hit the New Jersey turnpike. Snake and Rambo were safe. But they knew that while the Agents were still out there trying to reset the Matrix, they had to be alert.

Snake and Rambo (and Ernest Borgnine) rode off into the sunset, always ready to save the world...

"event","Episode III is coming. Some people are excited. I, myself, am not. I'd LIKE to be. The trailer looks promising. But then again, Episodes one and two looked promising, too, and I'm sure we can all name at LEAST one thing that made them terribly disappointing.

Which brings me to my point. What one element, in your opinion, broke the previous movies? (And hopefully, we won't have to include the one element that makes Revenge of the Sith unbearable. These are those elements for me. Of course, other people may disagree with how I interpreted.

Episode 1 is hard. It was (in my opinion, at least) horrible on virtually all levels. Still, if I had to pick one element out of all of them, it would be midichlorians. When they took the Force and turned it into something mechanical and scientific, something that could be rated and measured, they negated the element that separated Star Wars from other science fiction sagas.

Episode II was a vast improvement over the Phantom Menace, this I will grant you. It's also far easier to pick a single element that damaged the movies. Specifically, Anakin's lack of character development. It's as if they've forgotten that Anakin is the focus of this segment of the story. Sure, they give him plenty to do, and plenty of screen time, but he's still just cardboard. The only reason he's around is to make the final descent into Vader, and they're not bothering to make him in any way engaging before the fact.

Episode III. Reserved. Hopefully not to be used."

"event","Okay.  Normally I don't update very often because I don't have anything to write about, nothing has pissed me off so badly to be deemed ""Blog-worthy"".   But, today, I finally got pissed off enough to update.  And the living embodiment of my all of my wrath is that of a little Vietnam kid named Khoi.

Now, since the new year, it seems that my friends have taken a liking to my new mp3 player. Now, it seems that we have worked out a cycle between us: On the way to school I listen to it.  First period Dave and I jam to ""Video Killed the Radio Star"".  Second period Anna gets uses it along with half of the chorus class.  Third and fourth period I hang on to it.  Fifth period, Khoi takes it and drains my battery some more.  Sixth through eighth, I actually have classes.  And ninth period, I listen to it due to the scale tests.  Then, I have it on the way home.  With this much use, I usually have to replace the battery every 1 1/2 days.

Not today though...

Today, I gave it to Anna today for second, third, and fourth period.  This I had no problem with this because I see Anna in the transition of fourth and fifth period, so I trusted her with it.  Then came fifth period.  Khoi came up the walkway into the cafeteria like clockwork, and said he was going up to the library.  He still wanted my mp3 player, and wouldn't leave me alone until I did, so I finally succumbed to his wishes just to shut him up.  Then, he actually wanted me to go up to the library afterwards to get it from him, when he should come to me.  Since I was not going anywhere near the third floor, I said I would get it between seventh and eighth period, since he is in the library seventh, and I see him in the hall then.  So, off he went to the library.  

At the end of seventh period, I hurried upstairs to get it back.  Much to my surprise, well, not really, I had a feeling that Khoi was going to screw this up, anyway, I see no sign of Khoi or my mp3 player.  I see Dave in the hall, and since he is a library aid, I asked him if Khoi was in there.  He said he didn't see Khoi in there.  A little bit pissed off, I go to Larrick's class to be brutally raped by a conjugation test.

Ninth period rolls around, and I am thinking the worst, so I totally skip band and go searching for him, hoping he didn't lose it or give it to someone else.  After searching all the open doors in the school, I went down to the first floor and stayed with Anna, Grace, and Nicole.  Then, Mrs. Merryman helped me find him by checking the office for me.  He was in 233.  So, I dashed up there, interrupted Mr. Schweitzer's class, got kicked out of Mr. Schweitzer's class, went back down to Anna, Grace and Nicole, hung out with them until 2:22, went back up to 233, got Khoi out of class, expecting to get my mp3 player that I gave him over three hours ago, and he tells me he gave it to someone else...  HOW STUPID CAN SOMEONE BE TO GIVE SOMETHING AWAY THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO THEM?!!!!  GOD DAMMIT!!!  

Apparently he and Nick Mixter were playing with it in eighth period, and  Nick walked past the gym teachers with it on as loud as he possibly could, even though they have the authority to take it away from him.  Anyway, after Khoi gave it to Nick Mixter, Nick gave it to someone else!!!  God, I need to get new friends.  MORONS!  Well, at least the person Nick gave it to isn't an absolute moron, so I will be getting it back tomorrow.  But I'm still really pissed off.  Haven't been this pissed off over someone messing with my stuff since John lost my $110 calculator.  But I never got that one back."

Fucked Up
A level of status. Typically used in reference to being physically, mentally, morally/ asthetically, performance-wise, or even theoretically damaged in some way. It, in and of itself has many gradient levels, such as 'slightly fucked up', or 'extremely fucked up', but all versions have to do with describing the level of damage. A wonderfully universal root word, to be sure.

1. (physical): ""Ow! Man, I just fucked up my thumb by slamming it with my hammer!""
2. (mentally): ""That chick is SO fucked up, she ate a full ounce of magic mushrooms!""
3. (morally/ aesthetically): ""See that landscaping feature? Now THAT is fucked up! Anyone with half a brain wouldn't do that!""
4. (performance-wise): ""This horse's lap time is so fucked up, I could wak around the track faster than him!""
5. (theoretically): ""Naw, man...that would be so fucked up if you did that!""

um...  I dunno. Maybe

157) Have you ever been f*ed up? no
158) What color are your underwear right now? I'm goin commando today.
159) What theme does your room have? a roomish kind of theme where, ooh, get this, it's a room.
160) What size shoe do you wear? 13
161) What jewelry are you wearing now? a yellow Livestrong bracelet and a Celtic necklace
162) What is your screen name on AIM? Jade Falcon1337
163) Would you pick a wedgie in public? I think it's more embarrassing if you don't pick your wedgie.
164) How are you feeling right now? BLAH

165) When was the last time you were at a party? It would have been dave's Halloween party, BUT DAVE APPARENTLY DOESN'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME TO BOTHER TO INVITE ME TO HIS PARTIES, EVEN THOUGH EVERY PARTY I HAVE HAD, HE WAS AT THE TOP OF MY FRICKIN' LIST!!!!!  But, besides that, I went to this awesome LAN party.

"event","Okay, so this one time, I worked at Dollar Tree in Cranberry.  I hope to work there again.  But anyways, this one time, I went to work and only worked for like, 20 minutes.  I clocked in, then after a while I clocked out.  That was the only time I worked that whole week.  So when I got my paycheck, it only had 37 cents on it.  I immediately took it to the bank and asked them to cash it for me.   That was a fun day."

"event","Well, now that people are actually looking at my site, I suppose I should entertain them but updating now.  Gee, thanks a lot Anna.  Anyway since my life is fairly boring and uneventful, you too shall be bored by reading about it.  But I'll try to liven it up a bit if I can.  Aren't I a saint?  Anyway, this entry is over.  Stop reading.  Really."

"event","Now, this wasn't just any normal paper. Well, it was, but I actually gave a damn about this one for some reason. Normally, I just write some bullshit that I either just made up or looked it up on the internet the night before. I chose for my two authors J.R.R. Tolkien and J.K. Rowling. I had researched their lives and works thoroughly for this paper, and even read two biographies to do the best I could on this paper. I completed the four page paper adhering to her bullshit directions. Double spacing, MLA format, hell, even making sure the number 1 was not on the first page. Other than some of my private works, it was one of the best papers I had ever written. I didn't realize that I had to type the graphic organizer. Typing a picture. What genious came up with that. Brilliant. Anyway, I had turned it in half a month ago, very proud of myself for a job well done. Then today, I hear Nick say that the old bat finally gave them back today. Afterwards, I am sure I will do very well because I actually applied myself and tried. When 8th period came along, she passed our compositions back to us. She had given me a 59%. Why, you ask? Was it because the paper was terrible? no. Did I do it on some American authors instead of some English authors? no. What caused me to go from a B+ in that class to a 64% (my parents just loved getting that progress report)? One single, solitary, lone apostrophe. I used the word ""didn't"" in my paper. If I hadn't, I would have gotten a 97% on it (I bolded my title on the cover page, oh the shame). Bullshit of the bullshit.
Therefore, you understand my rant. I was just told I am a failure at writing and the entire English language in general. The only good thing about this was that the graphic organizer and the cover page were graded separately. I lost ten points total on those due to the errors I mentioned earlier.

Life sucks. Larrick sucks. I suck."

"event","Does anyone know why people write LiveJournals? Perhaps we're obsessed with the gossip in our immediate social group, or perhaps there is a natural inclination to the insight of other people's lives. Nevertheless, I'm utilizing idiosyncratically arranged lines of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numbers, and about eight punctuation marks, to perform telepathy. Sort of. There's something in my mind, something I thought at a given point or time, and then I put it here. After I put it here, you put it in your mind, giving you the same thoughts I had. So we essentially just experienced a telepathic exchange of thought, right?

Ok, so maybe a LiveJournal isn't so glorious as telepathy.

Maybe you want to know what I'm really doing, and it's not just messing with your head, telepathically or otherwise. Like children fear the dark, I fear something that cannot be touched. I fear being forgotten. Old photo albums are meaningless if you don't remember who's in them. A hollow face in a picture frame says nothing. To remember someone, there has to be meaning behind it. Much like all these idiosyncratically arranged lines of twenty-six phonetic symbols, ten numbers, and about eight punctuation marks are useless if you can't remember what it means.

So someday when I'm gone, I want you to read this, and remember the words I wrote were me."

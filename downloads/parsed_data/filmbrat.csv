"event","<p>I'm opening meta letters today!<br /><br /><br />Dear Filmbrat,</p><p><em>Veronica Mars</em> may have been cancelled. <em>Studio 60</em> is about to sunset as well. And&nbsp;the delicious coupling of Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver on <em>The Riches</em> may have already&nbsp;short-changed you with&nbsp;their 12-episode&nbsp;season. It may seem like all is <em>Lost</em> (which won't return until February 2008! HA! Oh I opened that wound again). But have no fear&nbsp;- there is plenty of good tv on cable this summer. You won't be regaled to watching <em>The Bachelor who bitch-slapped the Nanny during an Extreme Makeover Wife Swap.</em> In case you missed the obnoxious in-show animated ads taking up a third of your TV screen, I'd suggest that you tune into <em>Rescue Me, </em>Tuesdays&nbsp;on FX. Those guys are HOT. And not in that annoying Paris Hilton way. God will someone shoot that girl already. Oh hey...wait...I smell a <em>pilot series</em>...a story about a hitman...ridding the earth of celebrity trash. It would be the reverse of <em>The Bodyguard</em>. And&nbsp;bonus - Whitney Houston has turned to the dark side, so we could shoot at her. Oh the delicious irony! Quick, find my errand boy! And a double-soy extra-hot Latte! I've got an itch for a pitch! Excuse me...what was I saying?<br /><br />Have a Sunny Day,<br />That Marketing Guy from FX<br /><br /><br />Dear Filmbrat,<br /><br />Bellyflab here. You've held me at bay for awhile, but you have not eradicated me yet. I will not go down without a fight. Excuse me, I mean&nbsp;a GODDAMN fight. Feel the terror. You want to win this? Really?&nbsp;Well then. Bring. it.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Dear Filmbrat,<br /><br />Your nemesis Martha is now roaming the streets, and word is out that&nbsp;you use toothpicks in your chicken cordon bleu. You're a wife now and you still haven't learned the divine code of&nbsp;wifely&nbsp;duties?&nbsp;Toothpicks? Have you no shame?&nbsp;&nbsp;I've got three words: Watch. Your. Back.</p>"

"event","<p>A year ago yesterday, <lj user=""defcon_1""> and I got hitched. And while the&nbsp;pinnacle of the occasion was, and always will be, the&nbsp;teary-eyed promises that marked the official&nbsp;debut of this new&nbsp;Fisher Family, it was also a pretty rocking party. And for that, we thank all of our nearest and dearest friends and family out there that celebrated with us.&nbsp;<br /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=""center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/filmbrat/pic/00004hpr/""><img height=""213"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/filmbrat/pic/00004hpr/s320x240"" /></a></p><p><br /><br />For those who might wonder - yes, we ate the year-old cake. And&nbsp; it wasn't bad. In fact the cake part was probably more tasty and fluffy than it deserved to be after a year in the freezer. The frosting? Not so much. It was more a sugary solid mass than it was buttercream frosting. Just <em>wrong</em>, somehow. . </p>"

"event","<font size=""2""><p>My brother has now been here two hours, a full hour and a half past his original estimate. If you wonder why, we can start with this photo.</p><p><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/filmbrat/pic/000011fh/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/filmbrat/pic/000011fh/s320x240"" /></a></p><p><br /><br />This is our kitchen. Our kitchen is a&nbsp;force to be reckoned with, since she&nbsp;doesn't like change.&nbsp;<br /><br />Doesn't look that way upon first glance, does it? With natural wood cabinets and teal countertops it looks downright quaint, enchanting even, doesn't it? How bitchy can teal be? But when you attempt to do something for the good of the kitchen by means of upgrade, be prepared for trouble, as it much prefers its worn-out old accoutrements. God help the handyman who tries to upgrade her worn-out parts, as she will resort to the ultimate resistance, eventually wearing you out until you cry for mercy. We've learned this the hard way. </p><p>First several months back was the dishwasher, which was a 3-hour standoff between the kitchen and the handymen - our kind dishwasher-installing experienced friend (who was the first to say ""oh, that's an easy job. No more than an hour"") and </p><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/""><b>defcon_1</b></a></div>. Eventually, they managed to wrestle the damn thing out, but getting the new one in?&nbsp;They had to literally&nbsp;coerce the cabinets with a crowbar to budge a final 1/8 of an inch to get it in. And then that's when our friend discovered that after all of that, the kitchen plumbing threw one final curveball in the twisted copper pipe - which threatened to burst as soon as the water was turned back on. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>My brother, who has taken apart cars and put them back together for well over 2/3 or his life, offered to replace our leaking faucet, after learning that I have resorted to taping the head with duct tape to bypass the irritation of getting wet every time I turned it on. He assured me that it's a cake-walk, ""a half-hour, tops."" He boasts having done two alone in the last month. He could almost do them in his sleep. And now, he's been at it for going on...well, two-and-a-half hours and counting. The old one refused to come out, and the new one is refusing to go in...by - yup, you guessed it - 1/8 of a goddamn inch.</p><p>She's a stubborn be-yatch, that kitchen is.</p></font>"

"event","If you heard strains of the Mary Tyler Moore song a few weeks back, that was most definitely the music in my mind, as I skipped (read: <em>ran as fast as my legs could carry</em>) away from the job that was my nemesis and on to better (read: <em>helluva LOT better</em>) things. I've moved on to a place that&nbsp;gets the importance of practicing communication.&nbsp; Before you think how little it takes to impress me --get this: the folks at the old french place certainly&nbsp;don't know the word for <em>communication</em>. And if asked to define it--instead of looking it up in a dictionary, they would&nbsp;spend hours trying to figure out&nbsp;who was to blame for&nbsp;not knowing what the word was, and then bitching about that person, complaining how overworked they are that to even think about how the other person wasn't doing their job was losing the company money. Rinse and repeat.&nbsp;And you have a mere glimpse of what my day to day was like. <br /><br />So&nbsp;today--for the first time in a long, long time--I actually enjoy going to work. Even with 30+ minutes added to my drive? I still look forward to it. You see, in addition to the communication-concept, I have the privilege of working with 120 people who are as neurotically detailed as I am. As to the barometer of neurotic organization that I refer to&nbsp;in this case? Well, if you become giddy upon receiving a training binder <em>with tabs,</em> that is equal to the giddiness of person that created them <em>-</em> that's a pretty large neurotic circle.&nbsp; And if you don't get the fascination with tabs, then well, you can't appreciate my happy place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news, we became homeowners last week. After signing our names umpteenth million times on umpteenth million documents (including one that I think asked us to sign away our firstborn child, or perhaps brand ourselves? Meh, it's all a blur), we took over the bungalow that was my mom's house. So the fun with mortgages and house repairs begins. Whee!<br /><br />"

"event","I decided that I have worked hard enough for 2006 (Shows! A wedding! A spectacularly crappy job!) and that I should spend the last hour of the year at work, doing...well, not work. <br /><br />That was a mouthful. And a lot of usage of the word ""work."" Anyways...here's my random ramblings for the end of the year.<br /><br />Getting <a href=""http://filmbrat.livejournal.com/151971.html#cutid1"">married</a> to <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/""><b>defcon_1</b></a></div>&nbsp;was certainly the highlight of the year (and my life).&nbsp; Lovely day (even if&nbsp;was insanely cold for June)&nbsp;and&nbsp;even lovelier memories. And we have the DVD now to prove it.<br /><br />Just a sidenote on the temperment factor on name change? Annoying.&nbsp;Policy varies with the company. Anywhere from so-easy-just-bat-your-eyelashes&nbsp;to submit-every-form-of-bloody-documentation-including-DNA.&nbsp;<br /><br />I found the perfect <a href=""http://www.blurb.com"">scrapbooking solution</a>&nbsp;for the photo fanatics that are lazy (me) and don't have the patience for being creative with paper and glue (yep, me again). We created our parents' albums with it, and they turned out phenomenal.<br /><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/""><b>defcon_1</b></a></div>&nbsp;and I have officially become <a href=""http://www.tivo.com"">Tivo</a> fanatics. We now have a box for the bedroom, as well as a shiny new dual-tuner for the living room (thanks to mom taking the Christmas gift hint!). What's worse (or great, depending on your view)...I am considering networking the boxes so that we can watch shows in the bedroom that record in the living room and vice versa. Now, would that make me a nerd or a geek?<br /><br />Speaking of TV...Best new TV shows that are a must-record in our house:&nbsp;<em>Studio 60</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Most improved dialogue: <em>Heroes</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although...show with the most annoying use of ominous voice-over: <em>Heroes </em>again!&nbsp;<br /><br />Best new warm and fuzzy and utterly addicting show: <em>Ugly Betty</em> (and this was the reason&nbsp;for the second&nbsp;tivo box,).&nbsp;<br /><br />Best returning favorite TV show: <em>Veronica Mars</em> (although it threatens to repeat the <em>Buffy</em> curse with everyone attending the samn damn college). Then there's our sitcoms: <em>The Office</em>, <em>Earl</em>, <br /><br />Show that is showing its age? <em>Gilmore Girls</em>. Although, the departure of the show's creator hasn't affected the show as badly as I thought. It just feels done, though.&nbsp; <em>Scrubs </em>is&nbsp;nearing its&nbsp;life in season 5, given that they now have introduced the lets-distract-factor of the baby,&nbsp;and then there's the&nbsp;new freaky hairdo of John C McGinley. <br /><br />I'm on the fence about how I feel about Season 3 of <em>Lost.</em> <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://defcon-1.livejournal.com/""><b>defcon_1</b></a></div>&nbsp;and I have debated at length about the shift in focus from the sci-fi mystery to the pyschological torture (me: too freaking&nbsp;sloooow! Fish: ""Just right!"").<br /><br />And that's my hour.&nbsp;<br /><br />Happy New Year!<br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","Life has gotten the best of my attention, as work is kicking into busy season again, directing a show which opens next week, and catching up on the zillions of thank yous we still need to write for the wedding. Indeed, this girl? She is a busy one. Lately, at least. So, there's been a lack of love on the LJ front. Not that I haven't seen most of you in real life at least once in the last few weeks (except you, H-Bar, you anonymous lurker, all the way out in Arizona).

So on to the highlights and general musings:

Going to New York. This time for fun! The price tag of one such trip, given the number of shows we hope to pack in our little weekend, has me a wee bit leery, but <lj user=""defcon_1""> has often reminded me ""It's our birthdays!"" We threw around the idea of taking the el cheapo Chinatown Bus (yes I know, the joke is wasted with the spanish reference), but yesterday was a <a href=""http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO27333/"">dealbreaker</a> on that front. So, we're driving, right?

Call me crazy, but I like Justin Timberlake's new sound. More than a little. Don't judge me. It's good stuff to jog to on an MP3 player.

Saw <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</I>...and it really was...unmemorable. Very pretty, but the substance of the book was hacked to pieces.  I didn't like Marshall's <i>Chicago</i> either. He has good visual style, but can't direct plot to save his life. There's no flow or continuity in his actors' emotions. Meh.

I got sucked into Fantasy Football. I actually had performance anxiety going into the draft (will I pick the right people? Will I be mocked). Don't care how well I do now, as long as I can figure it out. 

And I'm here to say that I'm very much excited about planning the next annual Halloween bash. Y'all just disregard Fish's recent remark about the party being a pain in the butt for planning. It was the pain he was in. We love it. It's work, sure, but it's well-worth it."

Proof-positive that <lj user=""defcon_1""> has influenced me in ways I never imagined (aside from my appreciation of the punning art): I have spent the last two hours parusing sports sites to learn more about football. And I'm taking notes. With a designated notebook. Out of fear of being inadequately prepared for my first ever fantasy-football draft.  Guys, I only learned was ""1st and 10"" meant about 5 years ago.

I need to cut my hair. I need to force myself out of the laziness of the daily ponytail. 

I saw <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i> again. And it is still hilarious on the second time around."

"event","So to recap on my post-liquids-gel-and-other-similar-consistencies-ban flight to the heart of NYC.

* Airport was nuts - NUTS - at 5am on Friday. And that is a very bad thing when coffee is not allowed to get you mentally through the long check in and lock-down security lines.

* You can purchase drinks in the ""Sterile area"" past security (but finish them before boarding), although I never thought I'd use ""sterile"" and ""airport food"" together. Ever.

* I apparently have a freakish talent: downing an Large, steaming HOT Dunkin Donuts coffee in six minutes flat. To which my co-worker declared, aghast, horrified ""That is just not right."" To which I replied ""I don't waste my coffee. I'm hard core.""

* After watching some poor guy board with his own coffee, and get escorted off the plane, I had serious heart palpitations over my cream cheese that somehow made it past the boarding zone. I seriously debated the following: Do I risk being escorted off by the National Guard for the familiar tastiness of having cream cheese on my D&D bagel? Or forgo it in the interest of National Security. The answer? Eating a bagel dry? That's just not right."

I don't know if I'm more upset about having to check my bag due to the necessity of beauty products needed to keep my hair shiny and clean. Or the fact that I can't bring coffee on the plane, when I have a 6am flight.

"event","Monday come up entirely too quickly. I want a raincheck on my weekend, because I don't think I had enough time to enjoy it. Although I vaguely recall playing balderdash on Saturday, and not entirely sucking at it. 

I think I was inspired yesterday to go into business to start a party planning service. Because <lj user=""gingerirish""> were just talking about the lack of event planners in everyday life. And because I was at a bridal shower yesterday that didn't even get to the main event of present-opening until well into hour THREE. There was nothing of note to remotely entertain us up until that point, even. So with my first blocking rehearsal looming, and now seeing what remained of my Sunday melt away at a country club doing. absolutely. nothing. I was about ready to claw my eyes out.

Not to toot my own horn (because in fact I had nothing to do with this, except by showing up), but I think back to my bridal shower, with the ongoing trivia contest of wierd bizarre facts about us (Dave doesn't like corn on the cob...and yes in fact I always said I wanted to end up with a tall hairless man...), the craziness of the guitar-singing announcer and the Wierd Al duet with <lj user=""defcon_1""> that brought the house down  - and man, that set the bar high for what these damn present-grubbing events (no offense, hey I had one too) are. I really think that every guest deserves to be entertained like that at these things. And at the expense of the guest of honor, who reaps all the benefit of the gifts (so they should in fact be forced to be part of the entertainment). When I ran my friend's bridal shower too, I at least had bingo going on during the present opening, which seemed to <a href=""http://filmbrat.livejournal.com/141760.html"">work out well for laughs</a>. 
Why would anyone <i>not</i> want a more entertaining alternative?"

It is. Freaking. Hot.

I decided that would be a good time to do a little word-association, or free-balling, or however you call it. Or, you know, channel Paris Hilton. Who, by the way, is not hot. Anymore. Ha. Take that, flouncy-dead-eye-dog-carrying-pixie-girl.

The show <a href=""http://www.nbc.com/NBC_First_Look/Heroes/"">Heroes</a> looks hot. And freaky.

A little over two weeks ago in a northern suburbs of massachusetts, on an unsually cold and rainy saturday in June, you may have heard cries of joy penetrating the dreariness, marking the moment that <lj user=""defcon_1""> and I said I do in front of a boatload of our friends and family. 

It was a beautiful day. And I feel blessed to be married to the love of my life, and one of my best friends. 

I'll leave you with this - a visual tour of our most excellent honeymoon.

<lj-cut text=""The Fishers Cruisin' in Europe."">

Ah Venice. Touring the Grand Canal.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day103B.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

We ate authentic Italian cuisine. Spaghetti and meatballs, you ask? Hey, you have to do it once in Italy!
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day107-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

And of course, we did the ultimate honeymooner thing to do in Venice: a Gondola ride at night on the canal.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day111.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

We toured San Marco Square up close and personal (in the background is Doge's Palace, as taken from the rooftop of the Basilica).
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day211-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Speaking of the Basilica, check out <lj user=""Defcon_1"">'s skirt. Apparently you can wear any matter of tee shirt and hat in the Church, but if your knees are uncovered, you're smiting God. So for merely 1 Euro, you too can sport salvation in the form of an orange cloth.

And on the cruise, we toured more ancient sites, such as the Parthenon in Athens.
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day509-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

Apparently cats are everywhere, but since I was a photo-nerdy tourist, I thought it was most awesome to see a greek kitty hanging around the columns of the Parthenon, so I took a picture for posperity. 
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Day513.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>

And hey, during our day in Turkey, I photographed this. A Turkish Bath! With a Waterslide! How nifty, and simultaneously gross!
<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v224/filmbrat/Honeymoon/Honeymoon116-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>
Actually, it's a family-friendly turkish waterpark. Sorry to disappoint.

David (and I to a lesser degree) took every moment we could to be tourist fame whores on the cruise ship. This is David sporting a pose prior prior to his dive in the belly-flop competition.

And I, being silly with our nightly towel animal. For no one, except my husband.

See this? Parachuting of the back of a boat of the Aegean Sea? We did this together. By far one of my favorite things that David talked me into doing.

"event","Why does Fredericks of Hollywood not make a cleavage-enhancing bra for A cups? It is simply outside my realm of logic. And why must I be on the cusp of an A/B, which makes it doubly difficult to find a suitable bra? And why am I sharing this with you all?

I suck at playing pool. I think Texas Hold 'em is really my calling.

This is the last weekend for the show. I am slightly melancholy, but all good things must come to an end. Here's to hoping we go out with a bang. A bang which doesn't involve crotch-splitting-pants incidents (Ahem. <lj user=""actor_woof"">). 

<lj user=""defcon_1""> will do anything to make me laugh, which I sincerely appreciate. Even if it involves slight public humiliation. And a lime.

I bet the last sentence just conjured up a variety of dirty images for you all."

"event","I just found out that the opening of tonight's show is close to selling out. Holy. Shit.

That is most awesome and slightly terrifying all in one. I heard the phone ring quite a bit while I was up at the theater last night, but it didn't really sink in. Until now. Perhaps one cannot have epiphanies while mopping linoleum. But while sitting in front of the computer alone with a cup of coffee the morning of the opening? Hell yes.  

I forewarned the cast so that they may have ample time to attend to pre-show jitters. 

As for me, I took the day off. And in between some light errand running, I have an itinerary of distractions to attend to:
1. Catch up on some delicious fametracker.com articles, such as this <a href=""http://www.fametracker.com/blue_moons/misc_star_chamber_2006.shtml"">Oscars editorial piece</a>.
2. Read some <a href=""http://www.weddingchannel.com/"">Bridal Porn</a>. Then, take a shower.
3. Watch some stuff on the Tivo backlog.
4. Debate cleaning house...
5. ...then decide that is what Saturday is for...
6. ...be consumed by slight guilt that the house? She is awfully messy....
7. ...put a few extraneous boxes away and marvel at progress. Then, decide to leave the rest for Saturday."

"event","I like watching football.  My interest in the NFL games has really evolved over the last 5 years, once the barrier was removed.  That of course being my gain in knowledge when someone finally told me what the hell ""1st & 10"" or ""2nd & 5"" is.  Before that, watching games was like I had been dropped in the middle of Japan without a map or <i>Japanese for Dummies</i>.  It was truly *that* bizarre for me.  

Sure, I attended every single game for four years in high school, but that was merely for my marching band obligation.  I could care less what was going on the field. I tooted my saxophone when commanded***, and that was that.  I had much better things to do than to actually pay attention to the sport - what with making a mockery of the cheerleaders, discussing who the xylophone player was dating now, planning out we'd wear to the next party, or what that bey-atch in English class was up to now - my cup of entertainment already runneth over.

Slowly but surely, I've gotten fairly good at understanding the basic game mechanics. And I get better every day. When I'm watching the games with <lj user=""defcon_1"">, I can usually ask ""who's that"" or ""How the hell does a 2-pt conversion work?"" without feeling embarrassed, and he'll patiently explain.  He's like the Yoda to my sucky Jedi student. 

Last week, however, I was dropped in an abyss again, when I was invited to watch the Pats game at a friend's house, without my translator being present.  And these guys are hardcore football fans. They drop names, strategy, and stats rapid-fire back and forth.  And then there's me, sitting between them on a couch, munching on chips, hoping that my constant nibbling prevents them from asking me my opinion on blah-blah-blah and so-and-so, thus unveiling my deep secret....of being a fraud.

But here's what I learned: you can go far with the word ""f*ck.""  I developed some key phrases to navigate the landmine that is Watching Sports with Men.  Ladies, take heed: just repeat one of these, and they'll never know you're not one of Them...

<b>""What the f*ck?""</b>
Good for all things bad for your team.  If for some reason, you shout this prematurely, you can cover quickly by a myriad of other things - like an ugly bird outside, or a splinter, or a hair on your chip....

<b>""Give me a f*cking break!""</b>
To be used when you see the little yellow ""flag"" symbol come up...and let one of them lead, otherwise you might be shouting on an overturn in your team's favor. 
Also suitable right as they go into commercial, in my opinion.  Folks will respect your aggressive desire to refill a soda, or pee.

<b>""Holy f*ck!""</b>
Good for triumphant moments, like touchdowns. 

<b>""Did you f*cking see that?""</b>
Especially good when you know something happened on the field, but you can't identify which team is yours - this covers your bases.

<b>Advanced frauders: the every-other syllable ""f*ck""</b>
If your co-spectators leave you to recap what occurs while they're in the other room, don't panic.  When they come back in, immediately start hopping up and down, and excitedly repeat ""The f*cking guy with the f*cking f*ck totally went...f*ck! I can't believe it! I mean, f*ck!"" By that point, hopefully there will be an instant replay of whatever it is they think you're trying to convey, and thus your cover remains.  Problem solved.

This week was my 3 year anniversary with the Boy. And the boy brought home a beautiful bouquet of roses. 

Not to come out empty-handed (and what on earth do you ever get a guy for an anniversary, anyways?), I was struck with an idea...After I recovered, I realized that he eats my non-beef cooking without complaints.  And for a guy whose meal of choice in the bachelor years have consisted of buffalo wings and hamburgers, I thought he deserved some appreciation for tolerating my all-turkey-all-the-time substitution on every potentially savory dish. So, I concocted what I've now deemed the ""forget-beef-not"" bouquet: a taco kit, a can of full-fat refried beans, a king size Kit Kat, and the new Stewie Griffin DVD. I thought about including a package of raw meat to really seal the deal, but just...ew? 

And yes, if you're wondering, I wrapped it all. Even the refried beans."

"event","So, it's nuts.  Yeah...And it's been awhile. 

The wedding - as in the Not My Wedding event:

Two days before the wedding, I called my friend, the bride.
Me: ""Oh my god. I can't do this.""
Bride: ""What?""
Me: ""This reading you gave me for the ceremony? Are you serious? <i>And Adam
said....This one shall be called...woman.</i> Wo-man? Wooooman?  Now that scene from <i>So I Married an Axe Murderer</I> is stuck in my head. I'm going to laugh. I'm going to be run right out of the church. By your mother. With a pitchfork.""
Bride:"" Hee.""
Me: ""She'll kill me.""
Bride: ""Hee.""

Aside from one drama moment (not worth recapping), the wedding was truly lovely. 

This being my first time actually participating in a wedding, I have to say the whole walking-down-the-aisle moment was a bit of a strange sensation...which was probably a result of wearing heels, not to mention the 75 bobby pins that were jabbed into my skull causing localized numbness...Although I guess part of it was the overwhelming realization that occurred as I took one last glance at my friend, the bride, before she sashayed down the aisle: life caught up quickly and suddenly in those few seconds.  Although it's been close to 20 years since I first met her, it seemed like it flew by. How did that happen? Where did the time go? Shit...

So, between that and a little bit of stagefright - I started to come apart as I walked down. But I took comfort in seeing the lovely, smiling face of the boy, which helped tremendously.

I've concluded that wedding formal pictures are insane. Tilt your head two degrees to the left, shift your flowers down at a forty-five degree angle. Now, smile naturally. The hell?

I restrained myself until the last hour of the reception to actually get drunk (some of the other bridesmaids were already lit before pictures were done). Some might say it was the call of MOH duty, but really I knew that my lack of talent on all things <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/filmbrat/135574.html"">crafty</a> could very well end in a disaster if I was armed with safety pins and a task to fix a bustle while two sheets to the wind. Imagine the carnage, I ask you.

However, once 11pm hit, I was two-fisting the bottles of white zinfidel left on the tables.  Yeah, I'm hard core.  And, cheap. But goddamn it was good.

This week: Back on Weight Watchers. Hard Core."

The salesgirl offers to measure me. I respond cheerily, saying that I think I'm either a B or C, but would like to have a confirmation. While I've been on the cusp, I've already mentally prepared myself myself with the affirmation that B cup is still very much flattering and nothing to sniff about. 

The girl quickly does her thing and says ""Well, you're a B...or an A depending on the bra...""

What?

WHAT?

And that's how I ended up, for the first time in my adult life, with a padded bra.
************************************************************************
Wedding season will be coming to a close this weekend with wedding #3, the infamous Not My Wedding event.  Hoo Boy. After the festivities pass and the bride hightails it for Aruba, I think we'll breathe a collective sigh of relief.  It's funny how an event that is meant to be celebrate a happy occasion can turn vicious and emotionally draining.  It's also funny how one person loses sight of what's important, and can single-handedly destroy said event.

The bride is my MOH and since it's a given that my planning won't nearly reach the same level of intensity (since my mom isn't crazy like a fox), she feels some remorse. I promised her that if she'd like to even the stakes, I could call her up at 2am screaming ""It's lilac and not lavender, my life is over!"" You know, just for kicks. 

Not that it's all been bad. Wedding #2, just last week, was lovely and fun. Equal parts sweet and meaningful. Nothing was over-inflated with importance or over-produced.  More like ""Hey, we're married. Isn't this cool?"" 

And yeah, it truly was."

"event","Bah. I'm a bad, bad LJ-er. I'm sporadically catching up on folks journals in the dark of the night. Though it's frustrating to read things so post-facto that it's almost irrelevant to comment on it. Sorry, folks. But know that I'm reading and keeping tabs on you. : )

Hopefully the socially busy portion of my existence is coming into the final stretch (no, I don't count my own wedding as socially busy, because really? It's not). I organized a fairly successful gathering for my friend's bachelorette this past weekend. And while painting pottery and drag queens don't appear to be a good match in theory - it *so* is.  So damn the naysayers that scrunched their nose and said ""You're doing what?"" 

What can I say? I love me some irony.  

It was so freakin' hot this weekend, which was annoying since neither my car nor my house has adequate a/c. After some calamity with relocating my bedroom a/c to the living room, and dropping $100 to fix the car a/c - I felt that I earned the title of adequate host by preventing mass homicide, of the heat rage variety. Although 6 girls getting ready in one bathroom is not recommended for anyone with a heart condition. 

We adorned ourselves with feather boas (my prize ebay bargain of the year thus far). I customized the generic bachelorette veil with sequins because - hello? Drag queens call for the flashy. 

The show was a blast.  Silly, and downright dirty.  After watching a 6' 3"" man in leather boots and a one piece tiger jumper assault my friends boobs - I can say that I've seen it all now. No, really. 

The bride was giddy all night (partially due to the amount of attention her twin girls got from the queens). And the rest of the girls got drunk and danced non-stop.  So it was one big drunken, love-fest, with photos being snapped every few minutes. Since I was the designated driver, I granted myself one supreme margarita early in the evening.  And then chased it with a serving of fries (oh, damn that sodium craving!).

And while I tend to be thoroughly entertained by precocious little beings and all their little nuances, four hours in the hot sun painting Spiderman and butterflies will test the will of any woman.  

As for the job? It's entertaining, because I'm thoroughly engrossed in learning. And industry wise it's slow in the summer, which has allowed me to set up shop with automating some reports, in the ultimate hope that I can sometimes be, you know, lazy. I'm still trying to get a gage on folks, and I fear that my shy-ness might earn me the title as the <i>unsocial</i> one, if it hasn't already. But a new job/pace/environment is fairly overwhelming, so I'm trying to cut myself some slack.

I'm relieved to be moving on.  This is not a job you're meant to stay for the long haul, in all it's redundancy and simplicity. Over time, you could get sucked into the ""Union of the Toothpaste Cap Screw-on Workers and Nothing Else"" mentality.  The repetitive and passive nature of the work breeds laziness. Honestly, it's not even a <i>real job</i>, by real job standards - not when you're only really working 50% of the time. At best.

I have been questioning my own ability to adjust back into the fast-paced work life, after 3 years out of it. What if I've forgotten how to do it? What if I get through, say, 2 hours of constant work and want to take a nap? Then I remember that as little opportunity as there is to do so, I have taken initiative, or found solutions to some problem. Probably as much as one can do here. And there are folks here that don't even grasp the concept of picking up the phone or coming in on time. They make the same mistakes over and over, and never - ever - think about how to, you know, NOT make that mistake <i>for the thirtieth time</i>.

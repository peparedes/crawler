Hit the wall
Scream out loud
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place where
They will leave you alone

'Cause the weak will seek the weaker
Until they've broken them
Could you get it back again
Would it be the same

Fulfillment to their lack of strength
At your expense
Left you with no defense
They tore it down

And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same

Locked inside the only place
Where you feel sheltered
Where you feel safe
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence
Did they see the consequence
When they pushed you around
The arrogant build kingdoms
Made of the different ones
Breaking them 'til they've become
Just another crown

And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same

Refuse to feel, anything at all
Refuse to slip, refuse to fall
Can't be weak, can't stand still
You watch your back, 'cause no one will

You don't know why
They had to go this far
Traded your worth for these scars
For your only company
<b>Don't believe the lies that they told to you
Not one word was true
You're alright, you're alright,
You're alright</b>

And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same

As you, I've felt the same"

I used to be dead set on being an artist, then dead set on going overseas on mission work (possibly whilst being an artist). Now I'm not sure. Somewhere in the busyness of life, work, church et al I forgot how to work anything out."

"event","Hi! I am still alive and kicking... though you wouldn't have guessed that yesturday morning. I was totally exhausted, ill, tired, or something. Rolled out of bed about 2 hours later than I normally do, not leaving enough time to even do my hair to get to college/work on time. Got in the car, chug chug chug pfffffftttt. Dead battery. So texted college and got back into bed. I got the RAC man to jump start my car, drove to a garage to get a new battery, went to work and promtly got sent home and slept all day. (I got given a car in case you were wondering, a nissan micra N reg, and I've been very blessed with people giving me gifts of money to get it up and running).

I know I've not updated for ages, I don't have internet access outside of work or a mates bedroom now, neither of which I much like for writing personal letters or stuff like LJ. So for anyone who thinks I've vanished I am still around, somewhere!

I'm really enjoying my new course, I'm doing an internship with the college that I've been with for the last two years, and I've been sent to work with the Church that is attatched to the college. So haven't really had to go far. I'm working for the senior pastor of the church doing various things, doing some general admin,  leading prayer groups, leading a morning worship time with the students (I was a tad petrified when I found out about that one, but God came through for me), working in some community projects we do; go twice a week to a drop in center for the mentally ill which is held in a lady's home and based around having a meal together, once a month doing a ""tea dance"" for about 80 local elderly people, about to start going into a couple of elderly care homes to sing hymns and chat with the residents, go out to a cafe that we have open in the town center on friday nights for the under 18's - giving away free food and giving them a safe place to hang out... been driving various Pastors various places when they've been doing meetings or when I've been involved in doing meetings with them. Last week drove 750 miles in 3 days... no wonder I've been tired this week! I've just had a review of my timetable with the pastor who is looking after us, and got a few things sorted out, so shouldn't be getting so tired now! I'm absolutly loving it, getting such a varied taste of what goes on in a church and what is involved to make it all happen. Really looking forward to next term too when there will be more unfolding.

How are you all? Oh, I'm a lot better today in case you wondered. Just needed to sleep a bit more!"

"event","I've been trying for days to post here an update, but I keep on getting pulled away for other things. I'm back home with my parents now for the summer, and I signed up with a job agency for temp work, and it's quite unpredictable. Sometimes I get a weeks notice, sometimes only half an hour. I've been working for them since Friday and already I've been an usher at the local Magistrates Court, head chef to the homeless, silver service waitress to a load of teenagers, and waitress again today and Saturday. Good fun, but I don't always know what it is I'm meant to be doing (what I was taught is silver service in a previous job apparently is not actually accurate, and resulted in my number one ""ground swallow me up"" moment - Bobbie fumbling desperately attempting to serve broad beans and carrots with that silly one handed spoon and fork manoeuvre with huge hot silver platter in the other hand, which ended up with probably as many carrots on the floor as were on the plates, but fortunately none on the pretty dresses of said teenagers, which could have been interesting). In other news a couple weeks ago I was having trouble with rather painful boobs, which lead to the discovery that I had somehow jumped from 34aa to 36b without realising. Not sure how that happened but I think is hilariously funny. I really do amuse myself sometimes. I'm feeling a bit loopy right now but I've got to go locate a car so I can drive to work, so will update proper later."

"event","Why does gmail not generally work in IE? Is very annoying when all the college computers have is IE. pffft.

My time at college is swiftly drawing to an end. Only two more weeks of lectures to go, then four weeks placement, followed by two weeks preparing for the Church's annual camp (which has up to 7,000 people come), then a week of camp! 

It's been the best two years of my life, though not without trials and painful times (just come out of one of those actually, I still don't know what happened really, but I felt like I was verging on a mental breakdown, not fun, but in all that Jesus surrounded me with the right people and revealed His love and gentleness to me. Now I have such peace and renewed love for Him, and such a fresh understanding of just how prescious people are, and how importand just being with them and listening to them is, even if I don't have the awnsers. I'm freshly amazed at how Jesus used to walk on earth - he would mourn with the mourning and hurt with the hurting. But he never left them there, to those that looked to him he always lifted up - he healed people, he raised people from the dead, he gave encouragement, love, acceptance and forgiveness to those who had none - all with the power that only God could supply. How wonderful He was and is. how prescious to be able to be like him on this earth.

Anyway, back to college. I'm so excited to be leaving. It's been the best two years of my life, but I can't wait to get out of the lecture room and go and do the stuff we have been learning about. The placement I'm going to is to a family fellowship type church (modern church, very focused on love and community) in Bridgend. For those that don't know Bridgend is a place in the South of Wales, just at the end of the valleys, that was recently in the news for having had 17 teenage/young adult suicides in one year. When I heard about it and we prayed for it inn college my heart went out to them and something in me cried out ""Lord send me there!"" Now I find myself in the place where the Lord is sending me and I couldn't be happier. I'm so happy and privalidged to be going there, though I've no idea what I can do to help, but to demonstrate Christ in a place where many are still grieving and reeling in shock. How does one help there? Only God knows, and I'm sure he will show us the way."

"event","Easter holidays are here wohoo! Three weeks off from college, two weeks off from work, and ten days of skiing, yey! I can't describe how much I've been needing a holiday, this last term has been really busy - absolutely awesome, but due to working on a Saturday I think I've only had one day off since the start of January! Really exhausted myself for a couple weeks, by pushing myself too hard working on an essay on top of all the other stuff I was doing. I made myself quite ill which is never a good idea, especially as I then had to spend a lot of time sleeping in the afternoons to recover when I didn't really have the time to do that. But go the essay done, and got a lot out of it which was really good. And next term I will reasses what I'm doing so that I'm not doing too much. The problem comes when I see needs that need to be met or tings that need doing, I will often jump into doing it without thinking about whether it's right for me to do it or if it's right for someone else to do it. I just don't like to leave things and risk it not getting done! Which is a great, but not if I end up doing everything and exhaust myself. 

I've started helping out with a ministry that my church is doing, working with people from the local community with mental health problems, young single mums, and other people who are struggling. It's really incredible what is happing there, many are coming and being helped greatly, and getting completely better, by the love and acceptance and hope that they are finding through it. It's the kind of thing that I want to be doing when I finish my training here - helping people (especially ladies) come into the fullness of life that can be found in Jesus. I'm getting more and more of an idea of what it is that I'm going to be doing. The college where I'm at are going to organise a new thing next year for the few of us that want to stay on for a third year which is going to be a lot more practical experience and will really help me to get where I want to go :)

I'm loving this song:

http://www.myspace.com/davidcrowderband
The day is brighter here with You
The night is lighter than its hue
Would lead me to believe
Which leads me to believe

(chorus)
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
And I am Yours
What does that make me?

My eyes are small but they have seen
the beauty of enormous things
Which leads me to believe
there's light enough to see that

(chorus)
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
And I am Yours

From glory to glory
You are glorious You are glorious
From glory to glory
You are glorious. You are glorious
Which leads me to believe
why I can believe that


You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
And I am Yours
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
You make everything glorious
And I am Yours

From glory to glory From glory to glory
You are glorious. You are glorious.
You are glorious. You are glorious."

"event","2007 was a great year, most deafinatly the best year of my life so far. But this year will be even better. So much has happened in the space of a year. I've changed so much. It hasn't always been easy, there have been some really hard, and even painful times, but they all turned out served a purpose or were part of moving on and dealing with stuff (always good, not always pleasant). I've really experienced the truth of the verse 'in all things God works for the best of those who love him.

For anyone who doesn't know, I've been studying at a Christian School of Ministry in a place called Horsham. I'm not too sure how best to describe what we do there, it is a time of equipping and training for life, to be effective both within a Church context and outside of Church. Its a time of encountering God and growing in relationship with him, developing faith, learning to love God and others, and embrace and move into his call and purposes. 

For some time I had huge issues with God being a him. Because of issues being scared of men I held God at arms length. I loved him deeply but couldn't fully express that or, more importantly, let him love me. But in his gentleness and kindness he waited for me to be ready, whilst he worked on my heart by his love. It sounds kind of odd to describe it, it's such a personal thing. One thing I've really learnt is that God knows me and understands me fully, he is actually the only one who can fully understand. And such a marvel it is to know that he fully understands! I don't even have to try to explain to him what I'm going through, but simply come to my loving heavenly Father and ask for help. And when my heart is right with him he never fails to give it. 

I was already quite free when I started the course. I was free from the depression, SI, ED, and 95% from the behaviours. But I've gone through a lot of stuff on the men issue. I didn't realise just how badly the sexual abuse, ""date rape"", and abusive relationships had affected me. God's been so good and so patient with me, helping me through and setting me free from all the pain and trauma. Teaching me a new way to cope - going to him and letting him carry me. It was really painful for a while, I felt like I was being ripped apart, dealing with phobias and fears and flashbacks and guilt and forgiving and so on. But every step of the way, every minute of the pain he has been there. reassuring me that he will never leave me or forsake me. I've been really fortunate to have had a couple really understanding lady Pastors  who I could go to, but I've only seen them maybe ten times at most. Most of the healing and liberating has come directly from God - in meeting him in times of worship and prayer, in allowing him to put his finger on stuff and sort it out. And the awesome thing is that with God it doesn't take a load of going back over the past. It can be just one word, one scripture, one picture or dream, and some wrong thing is broken and life and peace come in. ""You shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free"".

I'm still a work in progress. There have been so many other things that God has dealt with in me. Living in a small residential community, sharing rooms, with a dynamic of Christian love can raise some challenges! You really meet yourself and realise what you are like, and you really meet other people and learn how to love them where they are at and not where you think they should be. It's awesome. I've made such good friends. I've never really had friends like this before. I always used to be so scared of people, the only people I would talk to were on-line. Now I can pretty much talk to anyone, whether I know them or not. It's so liberating. 

I'm whole. I'm free. I'm literally a new person. I know where home is, where I belong. I'm accepted and loved. My deep desire now is to help other people find that.

"event","It's been such a long time since I wrote here I don't really know what to say. I'm still in Horsham (about 25 south of London) doing my School of Ministry thing. I'm very likely going to stay on here and do the second year. I really don't have any desire to go back to Aberystwyth at this point, I know it's not currently the right thing for me to do.

I'm having a great time here, got a lot of new friends, learning, growing, and being challenged a lot. I've changed so much in just one year I'm truely amazed. God is just so powerful. A year ago I was shy, quiet, depressed, still trapped by eating problems and wieght worries. Now I'm free, bold, joyful, and couldn't care less about wieght etc. To be honest I don't know how to express it. 

Just wanted to pass by and say hello, I am still alive and deffinatly kicking (though I bounce more, people keep calling me tigger)."

"event","I just realised I've not updated since I've arrived at the School of Ministry. I'm having a great time, it's such a blessing to be here. Everyone is so loving and great, I'm making so many friends and learning so much. God is really pushing me and changing me. Gone is the scared depressed anorexic girl who hid in her room feeling lonely and staring blankly at a computer screen. now I'm happy, healthy, set free, sociable, not scared, and confident! I'm so busy, there is so much to do here. We get up at 5.30am (a time of day I previously was unaware of), busy all day most days (lectures in morning, work parties/cleaning/kitchen duties/prayer/etc in afternoon), then often I'm busy in the evenings. I'm on the worship team! Not entirerly sure how that happened, but it's pretty exciting, The music here is something else, so much better than a lot of Christian worship. Will have to get some of it up on myspace or something when I get time and figure out how (can listen to some of the youth's songs <a href=""http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=69061346"">here</a>. 

I've been catapulted into the graphics department, and am now doing a lot of photography for the Church. I should probably explain at this point that this Church completely blows away all stereotypes, it's very different, they do very high quality events and have a very high quality in the graphics and media departments, so it's a bit scary! I've never done event photography before, so I'm very much learning as I go along. Had a bit of a disaster on Saturday when I was photographing a big Childrens event, I only had 200 speed for very dark conditions, then my camera died quite drastically. This week covering a fashion event that is raising money for a charity that works with victims of abuse. I feel so very privileged to be part of this church, it's so much closer to what Church ought to be like. 

I'm getting baptised on the 19th at 6pm, anyone who knows me is more than welcome to attend (its in Horsham, just south of Gatwick)."

"event","I'm off to bible college tommorrow afternoon. I'm really excited, I know it's going to be great fun. I also know it will be a challenge at times, but I know I will come out stronger because of it. I'm mostly packed, it's quite a challenge to reduce what I want to take down to fit in one large suitcase (consider what I had in Aber completly packed out two car loads). I'll probably be sharing a room, and the space is very limited. The art materials I'm taking is the sum total of a very full smallish pencil case, a sketchbook and my camera. Feels wierd but also very liberating. Too often I've felt I've had to paint when I've not known what to do or I've just wanted to doodle, will be good to take time out from that pressure. I'm taking my bike and my map so I can get out and explore, I know nothing of that part of the world.

Eeee! I'm so excited I want to bounce about! If anyone wants to know more about where I'm going take a look at thier website <a href=""http://www.kingdomfaith.com/"">www.kingdomfaith.com</a>. You can watch thier services streamed live on sundays, though the sound quality isn't that amazing the services are. If you watch you might even catch a glimpse of my new hair cut :P (sorry can't currently upload a photo of it, will just have to leave you with the tease that it was a quite drastic change)."

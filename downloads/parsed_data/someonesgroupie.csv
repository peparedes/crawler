Found out Hollywood Vid guy is named Brian...people I am friends with know him..Ricky and Ben..hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm wonder if we're meant to be?!?! hehehehahahahehee I have cavities :(

It's kinda hot in here...got some Hubby Chubby today..was sure good. I hate it when people start their sentences like fragments, like I've been doin. Or they don't say doing, they say doin. I just did that too. Sorry all, not that anyone actually reads my ramblings. The URL that links to this on my msn profile is incorrect but I didn't feel like change it sooo..I didn't.

Jake Kirby is hot..is that weird? I don't think I'd date him but he is interesting..never online though. I think I bother him at times but I don't care. He can put up with it.

I loooove Brian...woohooooo :)

ok i had camp on mon and tues and it was exhaussssttiinnngggg..it was really hot too. i liked it alot though..private camp is awesome-o. i was sooo tired the first day and i just wanted to do stunting the whole time, but we only gotta do it for like an hour each day. i was like god dammit. i loooove flying and backspotting..baseing is fun too just not my favorite thing. i just love being a part of a whole stunt. well anyways..we had to do this one cheer like a bagillion times and get graded on it as a team from our instructor and we got to incorporate a stunt into the cheer....it was SO FUN. stunting is definatley the best part. i was a backspot, lisa and allison were bases and kara flew, who is a very good flyer. it's kind of scary being the spotter cuz when she falls back down in the pop cradle it looks like her head is gonna smash right into you. it never does..but it's still like ahh! on the last day me, allison, sophie and marissa kind of got in crazy moods so it was fun. fun is the only adjective i can think to use today.....tooooo hot to think. 

i get camp clothes...they're sooo cute! i get an nca cheerleader sweatshirt, little blue shorts and teeshirt...i can't wait to get it :) thankyou mommy!! i cannot WAIT to go to california in july...wooooohooo!!!

there is a really hot guy at hollywood video...i also found out he is a musicisian....woohoo...thank the lord...must find out more about him..well that's about all

"event","Well, I had my morning frappachino, but I'm feeling quite full..:( The guy at the front was so friendly I decided to get a fente instead of a grande. Pooo....Why are guys so much funnier and cooler than bitchy Starbucks girls? That's not all true though. Leanne at the Centralia one (yes, we all know each other by name) is really nice. But the ones in Oly are just buttheads..

Well, sounds like Kayla and Soph had an interesting night last night...Sophie told me about it on the phone and I'm gonna have to call Kayla later and check on her! They were all at Kayla's (everyone just hangs out and eats at her place, it's just the way it is)...so Sophie, Isaac, David, AJ (I've never talked to him before but he's supposedly nice, and a neat freak which is weird and unimaginable) and Alica were there and something saddening?/scary happened..I'm not gonna get into details..but I think everyone is a-okay right now. 

I'm seeing Shrek 2 today....pretty exciting.

Well, I can't believe I've actually updated my journaly thing everyday! I've just had the chance to come on each day, and it's nice to just ramble on when there's nothing else to do online..especially when there is no MSN on this computer! arghhh!!

CAMP IS TOMORROW!! Good, bad? I don't know........I don't feel like going but that's just cuz I'm in a lazy mooooood right now. I believe we'll be mainly working on stunting, which is AWESOME!!! I love stunting. I'm gonna try out for flying, which is probably the ""scariest"" part of a stunt, but whatever. I'm a really good backspot and kinda sucky at basing, but I'll work on that (on my technique and all that junk) and I'll be good. I want to be a great all-around cheerleader/stunter, which means you can do each part of a stunt really well. That's my goal. But I think I'd be good for flying because I'm not afraid of being up there, high, and I trust the people below me, holding me up. There's so much stuff you have to do though. It actually looks easier than what it really is..there's alot you have to concentrate on, for every part of a stunt. You have to be right with the timing and the counts...it's not too hard for me though. 

But yeah, I'm very exciting because we have 13 girls on the squad so instead of just one stunting group (4 people), we have THREE...so it'll be awesome at pep assemblies and games..like a competitive squad! Woohoo...the group that I am in is with Lisa, Allison and Marissa because we're all tall so kind of around the same weight area too. I love my little group..Lisa is a good flyer even though she didn't get to do it last season (she's a returner) and Marissa did well when we first put her up there...Allison was ok..lol. I just like all of them as friends and cheer mates though. They're all really fun and really nice..

Falalalala!!!

My sweet puppy is lying at my feet...awwww :) :) 

Well, I'm gonna go turn on the TV or radio or something...although the sound of the washing machine filling up is kind of comforting....I like this office...it's a nice atmosphere..it's business-y. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

God dammit there is a really fucking annoying song on the radio right now. You know when that happens and you are just like HOLY SHIT IS THERE ANYTHING WORSE THAN THIS? Why must these fuckers produce such shit, harming our ears. Fuckers. Well, I bought the new US Weekly today. J.Lo is on it, you know, the Elizabeth-Taylor-wannabe, media-hogging, marriage-rushing slut.

getannoyed.com is a funny website. Go to it. Well, I will probably be posting a few times this morning and later today ehehehe..I love late night. Everything is funnier, more exciting, more fun..better. And then you see the sun come up and you are like Yay! I get to see my people and get my frappachino and live the day..then you fall asleep. But there are feelings of greatness (and weirdness) you experience in the wee hours. Ever notice when you it is like 3 am and you are typing and what you're saying isn't making any sense at all? It's funny to read the next day.

Chris still hasn't written back. It's been only one day, lol, but still! I want him to respond! And I want to buy a CD of his reeeeeeeeeally bad..AAAAAAAAAAAAH. Anxiety. Frusteration. GOD IS THIS RADIO STATION PLAYING NOTHING BUT CRAP TONIGHT???!!1!

You know, when I do get tired, there is nothing better than the sweeet feeling of laying my exhausted head down on an inviting, soft, feathery pillow. 

Well, Sophie went to hang out with Kayla today..I wonder if she spent the night or not. They live in walking distance of each other so she just walked right over that earlier today. I was supposed to be with them but at the last moment I decided to come up to Oly to see my grandparents. I wanted to see a movie with my little old granny. :) Tomorrow, I'll be seeing Shrek 2 with my grandpops. ;) It should be fun. Mmmmmmmmm buttery salty popcorn. 

Um I don't know why people think that people who have little blog-y things or online journalish things are ""weird"" or classifeid under the ""poem-writing people"". What is up with that, I'll never know. Actually, I only know one person who thinks that. But why? Why does she think that?

I changed my layout! I love customization. Now my emoticon is a dancing green star and my layout is completely boring..black and white! Pretty exciting, huh? I'm watching Cheers right now. It used to be a better show a year ago. I don't know why it changed for me. The Wonder Years is a classic..that'll always be a favorite. I like Olympia..I always have. It's bigger and cleaner and, I think, friendlier than ye old Centerville. There are some quite annoying people in Centralia (eg; Brandon Jones..thank god he graduated). I dislike hicks. Not because of the unstylish Carharts they wear or the fact that they some how have developed a Texan accent even though they are from Washington..but because most of them hunt. I hope anyone that is cruel to animals in any way should be shot. It's not a superficial thing, like about what they wear. Honestly!!! I don't have anything against those little skaters and things..the ones who wear alot of black. Actually, I do. Only with the girl ones, though. I don't know..some of them bother me. Not just the girls...some of the people who act like that are such posers. I just laugh when I see them. But others seem to be truly like that. 

Till later, lovelies"

"event","I love dances. I can't wait till the begginning of the year one. I actually dance unlike those lame losers who just sit or stand around and chat..if you aren't going to dance and have fun and get sweaty, why spend money to be there? Go talk and hang out in the Safeway parkling lot like everyone else. I decided to type with perfect capitals, lowercases and punctuation today. I get in those moods sometimes..I don't know why. Well, today was the last day of school. I was kind of sad, just sitting there, and I cried in Mr. Gilmore's. I gave him like two hugs. I wanted everyone to stay in there! I'll miss my 5th period L&C class...Well, outside of the school there was a little band playing...someone said Jake Kirby was DJing out there so I was like ""cool! I semi know him!"" but once we got out there, he was gone. Luke Dietz, a sophmore (or he's a junior now I guess) was out there, and we realized how hot he is. He was playing guitar and he seemed funny so Sophie and I were like..yay! So like 20 minutes later we came back outside and I was like LUKKKKKEEEEEEE, you have to sign my yearbook..you don't really know me, but you are kind of hot. He responded with ""I'm glad you think I'm hot"" in my little annual...so yeah. Hopefully we will get to know him well next year. Well, we got to hang out with Jayse today, which was fun. It's weird how we suddenly kind of befriended Jake, Jayse and this little guy named Uliyses, who boxes, all in like a week. People are so friendly. LOL....have you ever seen that Brady Bunch episode where Peter's voice is changing? It's kind of weird. Well, after school got out and we left, got some Mcdonald's, I felt kind of relieved and happy that school is out. I'll still gonna see a lot of people and now I don't have to get up early. THANK THE LORD. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I wish Ricky was here...he gives reeeeeeeallly good massages. He saw me cry in 5th period and gave me a hug....I love my friends. I need to ask Jake Kirby to burn some songs for me...lol...Bittersweet Symphony...Dare You To Move and...oh, shit...that other song that I can't remember. SHIT!!!  Ugh, I'm sure I will remember later..like 3 weeks from now. I hate it when that happens. I'm talking to Kayla on MSN right now.....falalala..I love the song Thunder Rolls....it's country (ew), but Chris sang it at the Cancer Walk and he looked over at us alot during that song..gooooood memories....goooooooood, gooooood memories...Oh my god, yesterday at the gym, this guy opened the door for me and he was really hot, so anyways, I was like 'thankyou', you know, and he said ""(exaggerated cheesy tone) hey no sweat""...I was like woooooooahhhhh ooooookay. Oh, I got in a fight with Justin today. He'a one of my very good friends, but he acts like a bitch sometimes. It's dumb. But it's ok...cuz I got to see Miah Lewis today and he looked hot, actually. But about the fight, Justin said really sweet things in my yearbook and he was all like 'you've made such a difference in my life, thankyou for being such a good friend' and such...I was like awwwwww, so I wanted to thank him and give him a hug, so I came back later and he was like 'no' when I asked to talk to him. He was in the presence of sweet, sweet Miah Lewis and Miah was looking at me like 'I don't know what's wrong with Justin, I don't know why he won't talk to you' so I was just like FINE GOD DAMMIT and I walked off. Then later he's all buddy-buddy and I was like hey, that ain't coooo and we talked about it and he told me why he didn't wanna talk to me at that moment, but I don't feel like typing anymore. Kayla is anticipating my return to our convo box. Two more pop-ups: I love that White Stripes song..something nation?...the guys' voice reminds me of Luke. I also wanna see alot of new movies..including The Stepford Wives, which I'll probably be seeing tomorrow...Um, what else is there? I do not know. It's weird I'm a sophmore today. Ok, my lovelies, I love you all."

"event","<span style=""color: rgb(102, 255, 153);"">WELL..i recently sort of befriended this boy named jake kirby. i
thought he was in a band with the hottest guy in the world, but i found
out the person i am thinking of is a completely different person than
the guy that he has his little band with. it was a really weird
situation, and i am very upset about it. now i am on a quest to find
chris from oregon, or something like that. shitskies...well, back to my
point, jake kirby is a beeyatch. it is so annoying when people don't
respond on msn and when they do they are bitches about it. it's like if
you are 'busy', first of all SAY SO annnnd, if you are going to be too
busy to talk to someone, get the fuuck of the account, so people don't
message you. anyways...i decided to make my little journaly thing
because jake kirby had one and it was interesting to read....well....i am very sad today......:( :(..</span><span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"">.tomorrow
is the last day of school and i am feeling very contemplate-y..it's
sad....gilly signed my yearbook today and gave me TWO hugs...i nearly
teared....next year i will be in his room all the time..i like the
atmosphere in there. well next monday is cheer camp and i actually
don't really wanna go....once i get to it though i'll probably be
really excited and wanna be there. i am at sophie's house right
now........she is half asleep on the couch....we're listening to some
weird bandish music :S :S it's kind of jazzy which is nice but this
music is a little bit too french cartoon-ish...well, i wonder if we
will still be going to see lo-fi at the matrix this weekend......i
dunno if i want to......i wonder what i will do this
weekend....well....tomorrow is THE FINAL DAY..........it's
crazy.....jordan just signed online...eew..i should block him and
delete...why don't i?? i really don't know.....i'm just gonna continue
yibber yabbering because no one important is online....nothing to
do.....why isn't justin sexsmith online??!??! he's always
on..hmm.......well, i should look up oregon local bands or something.
i'm really pissed that chris-aaron or whatever the hell guy is from
oregon and does not live on seminary hill like i believed. hummer hum
hum humm.....see, my sound effects are normal...jake kirby's are odd.
he says 'heeeeehoo' what is that? i don't
know...........falalalalalala...oh, our french final was today...yeah,
that was ok......i wonder what will happen tomorrow...hopefully
excitingness and happiness and such..</span><br>"

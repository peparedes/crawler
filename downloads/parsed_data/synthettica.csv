"event","Ok So The California adventure. We started on January 13th by playing a double show at the Mainstage in waukesha WI. Had a blast. Finally got things settled and hit the road around 11 am the 14th. What to say but long ass drive. It was funny because we were asked i 2 gas staions in Illinois if we were in a band and had to sign stuff. Then we got to drive through the wildfires in Oklahoma. Very cool to see. In Amarillo Texas the trailer axle cracked and after a 16 hour stop we were on our way again. Then we ran out of Gas in the Mojave, coincidentally in the ""Devils Playground"". A nice park ranger brought us gas and a few hours later we were in Ontario California at the Switch offices. Everyone at Switch is great . Very helpful and supportive. We stayed at Chris' house. He is our artist releations guy at Switch. HAD A BLAST WITH HIM. Then it wa off tothe NAMM show. All I can say is wow. We had a great time. Met a lot of new people and saw some old friends like Ryan and Amir from Orgy. It was great to see them again. Then we played a couple of shows while there with Deadstar Assembly. Love those guys and had a blast. Cant wait to hook up again. All in all it was a great though exhausting trip. But w were sad to leavso soon. And after 44 hours of driving we were home. 

Now we are in the process of writing and recording a new cd to hopefully release by summer. We are talking with a few labels to release on. As the fate of Prototype and Spinerazor is unsure at the moment. New merch is on the way including new shirts and such with new designs. We will be going out for some more shows with Powerman 5000 in May as well as other tours tba. If you wanna see pics from the trip visit the tour section of our message board www.cynergy67.net/board  So I guess thats it for now. i wil try to update on our progress."

"event","So tomorrow night we play at Big E's beach Club in Edgerton which is about 20 miutes south of Madison WI.
We will be joined by Revelation Theory, Copper, Alston, White Knuckle Trip, Flat Atom, Snooky, Leviathans Choir, and 13 pills. A solid lineup and hosted by WJJO. Lets not forget the women baring themselves all night for Girls Gone Wild. I look farward to the big crowd because you know plenty of lonely drunk men will be there to look at tits. So be it. If it sells more cd's for me. This is our last show for awhile while we take care of some things both stage wise and member wise. I will be in my studio working on new songs for our upcoming cd. And while on break we will begin filming our video to be on the dvd. As long as all goes as planned we will be back up and ready to tour again by April. And Hopefully the cd and dvd will be released together by fall. So if your not busy tomorrow come see us. And if you live near Madison WI be sure to listen to 94.1 WJJO from 9pm to 10pm as I did a call in interview yesterday which will air then. We will also be on Concordia Univesities airwaves tonight from 6-7:30 so if you get it tune in. And dont forget we will be handing out a ton of Amp energy stuff tomorrow night as well."

"event","So we have a show tomorrow in Edgerton Wi. Will be fun. Have an interesting show coming up at the same venue on Feb. 19th with Girls Gone Wild. Originally it was Powerman 5000 but due to a quitting guitarist they backed out so the GGW Rockin Across America tour took its spot. 11 bands and GGW. Im sure it will be fun. 

I am now an endorser for Hiptrix glowing drumsticks \m/. I will be using them in the live show starting in spring when we kick off the new show. Since i am singer and vocals I will only be doing limited percussive stuff live but will enjot it nonetheless. Working on revamping the band again and getting set to record the next full length.
Hopefully followed by a tour with such bands as Cell Dweller and The Birthday Massacre since we all plan to tour and are on the same roster. Lookin forward to a good year. Time to get Cynergy back to where it was before we got stuck with half ass drummers and bassists.

Also keep an ear out for DTX7."

Of course this is nothing new. Its hard to find anyone who can actually play our stuff and do it right. But with the tour coming up i do worry about having one in time. I will not take the easy way out and start putting the drums on a dat or computer. Thats just not playing music to me. I know we are rare or weird in the fact that we play electronic music but have all real members actully playing it. I like it that way. I just couldnt hit play on a comp or something like that. Thats to easy. Im sure we will find someone but it just pisses me off that it always happens right before we are supposed to do something big.
In other news the new ep is done and it sounds killer. I cant wait to get it reproduced to sell. The new songs will debut on WJJO in Madison Wi this sunday 9-10pm."

Amp Energy will supply drink and promo stuff.
New Cynergy 67 ep
Possibly some new Cynergy merch but that depends on when it gets here. As long as its on time for tour then great. 

More shows added to the tour. I will post them once all are in. Its going to be a long fun trip. I didnt realize how many Cynergy fans there were. This is a good thing. Now just have to have my new clothes finished from Cyberoptix and get my new prohibition stuff. Build my new synth stand (more like command station)
finish the backdrops for the tour and finsh some of the props. Some other cool things in store along the tour. Cant wait.

A few new sponsors coming as well I hope. Not saying until confirmed but I am glad about who they are.
Now f i could just get that damned Korg endorsement since most of my synths are in fact Korgs. 3 of 5 are. I dont care what anyone says Korg is great. Any synth is if your creative."

"event","This has been a great week so far. We played to a packed room at The Rave in Milwaukee last friday when we opened for Orgy. Was a very fun show. Due to problems beyond our control we pulled out of saturdays show. No big deal. Then Wednesday we played with Orgy again in Appleton. That show was a blast. Crowd was smaller than Milwaukee but fun none the less. Godhead wants to tour with us so we will be working on a possible Godhead, Cynergy 67, Crossbreed tour for later this year. Adrian of Powerman 5000 approached us about possibly doing some dates with them this year. And we may go out with Orgy if they do a second leg of the tour. Sounds like a busy year. We are putting the new cd on hold for now so we can hit the road for awhile. We will record the new disc probably later this year or early next. After the show we went with Orgy to the strip club. That was all kinds of fun. Ryan Shuck was stuffing dollars in my shirt. Hes a funny drunk. A good time had by all. Cant wait to do it again.
Later today (friday) we head to Prairie Du Chien to play what is sure to be a full house. I have the grand suite for my wife, myself and our friend. I love big hotel rooms, especially with Hot tub and fireplace. A rare treat for me. Then to Mainstage in Waukesha on Saturday with AM_Psyche. Hope it goes well as I havent talked to or seen them for awhile. Then Sunday at Pulse 26 in Juneau for an all day techno event. A full weekend for us. Should be a blast."

"event","So things are good in the Cynergy camp for the most part. Possibilities of an US army base tour. Possibly Wave Gotik Treffen in Germany. And a hell of a lot of shows coming up. My life has been strange. I dont know what to think of it. New people new adventures. I do need to get my brain together and focus more on what Im doing with everything. I have the band, and now a new project which is basically a performance group where the musicians act as well. Should be much fun. And 5 releases coming out on my label in the next few months. Just need to keep focused. And all will be well. Problems at home have me worried. A grandmother who nearly died this week from a heart attack. Thank god she is well now. A wife who will be going in for surgery again. It hurts to see her in pain. I feel so useless that I cant make it better. But i know it will all get better. Just keep swimming."

"event","So here I am at 4:53 am still awake. Im trying to write lyrics to our newest song. Usually I have the lyrics first and know what I want, but this song came together rather quickly and spur of the moment. Its a great song musically. very techno synths/beats with heavy guitars and bass. It defines techno/metal. Here is my question to you all. I have a certain style of writing. I dig  deep in me to get the words. Usually about former girlfriends or the changes in me. But I am somewhat of a happy person nowadays. I can still find the bad place to get the words but my question is, Does it always have to be negative? Just because we play heavier stuff or industrial does it have to be depressing or hurting? Can there be words about how much you love someone or want someone? I dunno. Let me know what you think. Im tired and i guess im reading to much into things."

"event","Had a fun week.  The tour was a blast. Got to chill at Mike and Alec's joint. Alec and Heather put uv blue rexlace extensions in for me. They looked sweet. Amp energy is considering sponsering us. Maximum Ink Magazine had some nice things to say. The WJJO rockin the Midwest 2003 release party was a success. Huge crowd. Working on A tour for February now. New drummer in the band. Thank god thats over. I am actually happy Praxxis is gone. His issues were to great. Things are rolling along swimmingly.
Got 3 weeks off until we hit the road again. Then break for christmas and back out again. The compilations for my label are going well. Should have the first release in January and the second in March."

"event","So tomorrow is the show in Shawano. Our drummer has departed early because he cannot handle the everyday action of breathing. His imbalance of the mind is sad. But anyway his playing had decreased in quality over the past few shows anyway. We will still be playing tomorrow and we will still kick ass. <lj user=""binary_cyborg""> will be out to see us with some people so rock on. Im lookin forward to it."

"event","The show last night was great. All the bands were good and as usual the crowd was a lot of fun. With the exception of a fight breaking out and someone getting stabbed and all the police it turned out great."

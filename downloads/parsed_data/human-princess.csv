"event","Dear Shinou-Heika,

I want to apologize for biting you on the hand.  Conrad says that apologizing sometimes doesn't mean that I'll be forgiven, but he and Yozak say that it's important for me to take responsibility for my actions.

I'm very very sorry for biting you.  You were holding me up by my arm and it really hurt, so I wanted down.  I read that I made you bleed--I'm sorry for that too.  If I thought it would be okay, I'd go back to the Temple and bandage it up for you, but I don't think you want to see me ever again.

I know Yozak well enough to know that he won't ever apologize for what he said to you.  He says that it's important to stand by what you believe.  I don't want to apologize for him--it's his place to apologize, not mine, but I wanted to explain why he reacted the way he did.

Yozak is my uncle, because he just married my Papa Wolf's brother Conrad.  Yozak doesn't have any family--he doesn't know who his papa was, and his mama died when they were in a work camp in human territory when he was little.  Now that he has a family, he's really protective of all of us.  He loves us.

Have you ever loved someone, Shinou-Heika?  Conrad says there are many different kinds of love:  romantic love, that makes your heart do funny things, or friendship that means you'd do anything for the other person.  Yozak's sort of love towards us (except for Conrad, that is) is family love.  It's sort of like friendship, because you'll do anything to make sure your family is safe.

Yuuri says that everything can be talked out, but Wolf says that you have to fight.  I don't know which one is right--maybe they both are.  I do think that if we try to understand each other, we can all live in peace, like Yuuri thinks.  We might as well try that first before attacking one another.

I hope your hand is okay, sir.

Sincerely,
Greta Shibuya-von Bielefelt"

The seamstress taught me how to make a sweater for my stuffed toys, but the one I made sorta lopsided--the back's got too much fabric and the front doesn't have enough.

Anyway, it's little.  D'you think we could put Peony in it?!"

Yuuri, everybody!  Gwen made cookies with me--mine don't look <i>anything</i> like his, but they're yummy!  Do you want some?  <small>Gwen ate <i>five</i> of them, so they have to be really really good!</small>"

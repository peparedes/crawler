"event","Today i felt like i wanted to curl up and die.  Katie was busy this morning while i was at a Marine Corps function, but i managed through that.  After seeing her at her house later in the afternoon, she told me she was going out with her grandparents for the evening to go shopping.  She surprised me while i was at home and called to say hi.  I did the worst thing in the world.  I called her a bitch.  If i could ask the lord for one thing in the world right now, it would be to rewind time so i could act differently towards her.  Wow...  11 months of dating, 7 years as friends, and i dont remember ever feeling this badly for something i said to her.  She's the girl of my dreams, and someone i could honestly see myself with in the future.  Having a family, big house, and just being close like we are now.  I think i hurt so badly when i find out things go the other way than planned, but i need that confidense and self esteem boost when i tell myself things will be better.  I love her with all my heart, and i hope that she can find somewhere in her the compassion to forgive me.  I love her.  My attitude will change towards her after this, and it'll change for the better"

"event","Being a guy, i'm not used to writing in a journal.  It seems more feminine to do this, but today, things are really bothering me.  Katie, who i've been going out with for 10 m onths, decides to explode at me, and tells me to leave saying we were done.  Upset that she keeps her feelings in all the time, and wishing she'd tell me more often what things she doesn't like, it feels like someone ripped my heart out.  Katie was the biggest part of my life, and now its gone.  i have no motivation to go to the YMCA, or to try and do anything.  I drive her and her brother to school everyday...  Will that change?  Will we  be going to dances, or out to dinner on weekends, or will we snuggle anymore when we just want to relax and rest.  Everyday was a new day, where things could change for the best, or change for the worst, and i took advantage of every moment i could.  She tells me that i take too much time away from her friends and other things she enjoys in life.  Why did she tell me anything like this before.  Maybe she mentioned it once or twice, but you cant just let something this big go if it doesn't change.  I love her to death, and that'll never change.  I'm in love with her, and i want her to be happy.  But, i want her to be with me.  I'd do anything for her, and she knows that.  But shes always too afraid to ask for something, or just assumes that i'll catch on.  It doesn't work that way for me...  Communication!!!  Right now, i feel like i shouldn't be alive.  Right now, i want to drive 100mph into a wall.  Right now, all i want is to hold katie in my arms and cry to her, telling her how much she means to me, and praying that things will get better.  With God on my side, i believe...  And that should be enough to give me faith in us..."

"event","Katie and i have been away from each other for 14 days now.  300 hours longer than we've ever been away from each other before.  it's been slightly more bearable since i've been visiting my brother in milwaukee and helping him work, but it still sucks.  everytime i have a chance to stop and think about things, katie's right there on my mind.  i carry a rock in my pocket that she gave me, and i've had it ever since.  i've also had a lot of time to think about my decision with the marines, and what i want to do about my enlistment.  katie's been a big part of my life, and she's always supported me in any decision that i've had, even if her first opinion is against it.  i think that i need to sit down with katie and have a serious talk about what we're to expect after high school, and if we're going to stay together by marriage, or just call each other when we get the chance and go our separate ways.  if it were my choice, we'd get married, and live with each other on base till i 1) retire or 2) finish my tour and get a new job.  but, there is this obstacle of katie going to school after high school, and that will also get in the way.  She'd have to go back to Canada in order to attend school, and to keep her citizenship.  but if we got married, she'd be a US citizen, be able to attend school here in the states near where i'm stationed, have financial aid from me, and benefit from some of the military family benefits.  many options...but we'll have to talk to each other and find out what seems to be the best for now.  Semper Fi"

"event","I'm home from Wyoming now, and i was very excited to get here.  The only problem is that my favorite girl isn't here.  I had a lot of time to think about things in my life while i was gone, and most of the revolved around Katie.  i love her with all of my heart, and i need her.  I graduate the 3rd of June 2005, and leave monday, june 6, 2005 for boot camp.  I dont know if that's what i truly want to do anymore.  On the way home from my vacation, my dad thanked me for coming and pointed out that this was probably our last vacation for a long time since i'm enlisted into the Marines, and expected to be in San Diego three days after graduation.  That means no more family holiday's, thanksgiving, christmas, and i cant just go to a funeral of a family member or friend.  I wont be able to just jump up and go to birthday parties, or always be there for friends.  And most of all, unless Katie and i are married when i come back from boot camp, i doubt she'll be with me after i graduate high school.  I love her with all my heart, and she deserves everything i give her, and more.  I just hope that this upcoming 10 months places the answers i need in my lap, and allows me to make a good decision about my future.  I'm tired, and i need to sleep, so i'll leave it at this.  Semper Fi"

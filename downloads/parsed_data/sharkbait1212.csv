"event","you know, ive been thinking about this a lot.  i dont think people my age are really meant for marriage.  i dont know of one marriage or engagement that has worked out with people my age.  a few engagements have broken, including my own.  and marriages have plumbeted into a horrible abbys of broken dreams and hopes.  and why do these relationships end?  a whole bunch of reasons.  entering a engagement before both are ready, wanting to get married, people changing, blind love, being too young, not mature enough, and of course the typical- bitchy mean controlling mothers (yes, it has happened to other people, too).

so what do we do in response to all of this?  become bitter, commitaphobes who are too afraid to ever trust again or let someone love them.  and throughout all of this, im not cynical.  honestly not.  someday i want to get married.  yes, i do.  but trust me- not for a frickin long time.  this past engagement cost my dad so much money.  and the ass wasnt mature enough to pay my dad back any of the money.  so, i also want to make sure that things are financially ready.  even tho i can tell you, i sure dont want a big wedding.  no way.  

relationships of any kind take work.  and when one of the people just dont want to work it out (or are completely controlled and brain washed), then its almost for the best that the relationship burns and crashes instead of lasting a long time, years and years, and then things would get worse.

oiy.  honestly, im not cynical.  just worried about everyone who is or has gone thru this horrid stuff."

"event","have you ever just sat on your bed/chair/couch looking at the room around you with no noise or distractions of any kind?  just you and your eyes viewing and observing all that is around your physical body?  it is weird that in the absense of distractions and with concentration to the point of almost none, the realizations we can discover.  just the chance to have a purely mental view of life.  without the sound, we can almost hear our thoughts.  and without any moving visual stimulation, we can almost see our mind.  and a time such as this allows oneself the opportunity to think to the deepest level.  to think about the simplicity of an act to the complexity of a life.  to delve into the past.  to expand ideas of the future.  you can take one thought and compound it into a million.  and once the thoughts have either multiplied into infinity or condensed into a single one, can then realizations or even questions be made.  an understanding about a path you should take and then questions on how and why.  the concentration to plead about the choices of the past and the future.  to decide what next steps should be placed to walk according to the inner mind.  

it is a chance to think about what we want for ourselves either now or later.  and wants can be possibly transformed into acts.  but first, we must figure out the how.  and many times it is the looming question of how that prevents us from surpassing the fears and doubts we may have.  the inner self teasing, taunting, attacking the heart and sometimes even visa versa.  

now, as i sit there staring about my room, i think of how to change these circling thoughts that are drounding my mind.  conclusions arise but pass as quickly as they came.  and conclusions merge into hopes.  and not just hopes but viewpoints.  and only then, only then when my mind connects with my thoughts, can i fully start to discover, realize, and think."

i went to the dr yesterday, and she gave me some good ideas but also took blood work just in case.  for the past week ive been very extremely dizzy, really fatigued, bad migraines, sensitivity to temperatures- more than normal, and really sensitive to touch.  and no, im not pregnant.  (thank god.)  these are really broad symptoms and could mean a lot of things, but she's thinking its due to allergies and getting over from being sick sometime.  she found fluid behind my eardrums, so thats why she thinks that.  she did take blood work just in case there is something else.  its been so bad that i havent wanted to drive anywhere because of the dizzy spells being so intense and frequent.  ugh!

tonight at work we got to dress up!  i dressed up as a black cat.  the little kids were getting such a kick out of it.  i pretended to be a kitty cat for some of the kiddletts.  i love kids' smiles!  on wednesday we also get to dress up (since it is halloween), so i am thinking of going as little red riding hood that i was last year.  it has a cape!  a red cape!"

im watching the producers on hbo right now.  it is so funny.  i love this musical.  mel brooks is a genius.  i saw it in new york city on broadway, and now it is on hbo.  well, it has been for a bit.  great musical.  if you havent seen it yet, you MUST watch it.
<br>
so, work has been going well.  since i have worked a few days and i am always on my feet, my back hurts.  today i start camera training.  i am doing pretty everything there.  its great.  ive done lobby stuff, sales stuff, and so much other stuff.  camera training should be fun today.  and ive made friends, too.  its a nice job.
<br>
i take my GRE tomorrow.  oh gosh- im so nervous.  im growing up!  i hate standardized tests.  all they determine is if you can take tests.  they suck.

so yesterday was a totally rockin awesome funness day filled with pumpkins!  dad and i went to schnepf farms in queek creek for the pumpkin festival.  dad and i went mini golfing in the cute little course they had set up, went on a hay ride, fed deer, got completely lost in a 10 acre maze, ate some yummy food, and picked 2 nice pumpkins.  it was so much fun.  i got completely covered in dirt, deer spit, and coffee i spilt on myself earlier in the day.  it was so much fun!

"event","yes that is correct folks.  allergies do suck.  when dad and i were dusting my apt, my allergies started declaring hell upon my entire body.  i think there must have been some pollen that was with dust that got kicked up into the air when we dusted.  i had those stargazer lillies awhile ago, and i discovered that i was allergic (badly) to them.  so the pollen left over was probably on the stuff we dusted.  so, now my body itches, eyes are swollen and itchy, and my throat is annoyed.  it was really bad before, and so i took a clartin and took a long long shower, and that helped.  but, dad and i just went over to clark's, and he had a fire going outside.  and obviously fires have smoke which of course went into my eyes hence causing allergies to suck again.
<br>
the reason for the dusting... dad bought me a new tv!  24 inches of correctly colored people.  ah, correctly colored people you ask?  well, my other one was turning people green.  to be more exact, over a third of my tv screen had a green tint.  it was old.  well, actually it was leif's, so who knows how good of care he kept it.  so, we had to dust the old tv and the place the new tv is going, so that is how the dust happened.  but, i love my new tv!  its so big!  the other one was 14 inches.  this is 24 inches!  its huge!  and now from my desk i can read things on the screen (like tivo and such).  
<br>
so, the tv is the big and exciting news of the day.  other than that, my life is a roller coaster of events, emotions, and such.  
<br>
and the best news of all... THE DBACKS ARE DIVISION CHAMPS AND ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS!!!"

"event","so suprisingly i havent felt like writing anything.  which probably isnt the best in the grand scheme of things, but tough phooey.  a lot has been going on in the world of katie, just to say the least.  i saw one of my best friends last week.  bri came from san diego for a conference in goodyear, and then he stayed with me for 2 days.  last weekend i went up to flag to visit friends.  i only saw cody and sam, but it was worth it.  i forgot how much i missed my cody until i was with him.  (insert tear here- wait did i spell tear right?  oh well.) overall, it was a nice weekend, but it was also bumming at the same time.  i realized that i dont fit in flag anymore.  and i dont feel i fit in here in phx.  dad says that not fitting in flag is due to not being in college right now, and i sure hope he is right.  but anywho...  it wasnt as hard as i thought it would be also on the leif front.  i thought it would be terribly hard to go back up to flag again bc of all the wasted memories.  suprisingly, tho, it wasnt.  then again, i have no respect for him anymore, so i guess that could be a big reason.  oh, and another thing awesome- a friend who i havent talked to in about 4 years gave me a call the other day!  we've been friends for like 7 or 8 ish years, and we just lost touch.  how cool is talking to him again!  yay for myspace.
<br>
ok, what else...  photography is going well.  i couldnt go to class last night which was a big bummer.  but, there was a darn good reason (of which i dont feel like going into).  so, now i have to finish my project wednesday before class.  thats not that big of a deal tho.  oh, and its finally starting to cool down here in phx, so tennis class wont be as bad heat wise, and maybe dad and i can actually start practicing!

<br>

thing two...
i told you all that the time when i was supposed to get married in december is going to be hard for me.  even though ive moved on and am over him, still.  it will hurt.  i dont want it to, but marriage and pledging your entire life to someone is big.  and having that taken away is hard.  and the date of the wedding is going to be really hard.  most of you cant understand, but atleast symphathize.  so, i really need my friends around me during that time.  and i need to do something big and fun to keep my mind off of this.  and this idea was something many people suggested to me including my psychologist i am seeing for this stupid relationship crap.  so, i thought vegas.  if we all share a room or two, it will be cheap.  and its close so we dont need a plane.  and it isnt hard to budget your money.  dad is helping with my rent, but other than that, i am living off of only $400 a month.  yet i can budget and afford this.  some of you, yes i understand.  but most of you i am getting the whole money thing and then you go buy something frackin elaborate for a lot of money.  or you say that you arent sure if you can come bc you might do something else then.  i feel that friendship is a two way street.  i give so much, but after hearing all of this, it hurts.  honestly it does.  i feel so isolated from everyone and so lonely.  and when no one will agree to spending time with me during a time that is really hard for me, it makes me doubt or wonder about friendship.  there are only two times in the whole year i ask for friendship.  and yet, i am really suprised by the lack of support i am getting.  

<br>

i thought id tell everyone how i am feeling.  and this does not apply to everyone.  the people who live down here in phx are good.  basically this is for flag people.  do what you want with this letter."

my first day of work went, well, good.&nbsp; it was boring, so saying it was good is kind of a misconception.&nbsp; yesterday was just all about filling out paper work, listening to the gm talk about rules, and watching these boring videos.&nbsp; there were about 20 some people there, and so i met two people.&nbsp; nice girls.&nbsp; im excited about this job.&nbsp; ill get to meet a lot of people.&nbsp; tomorrow i have to go pick up my apron, tie, and money pouch thing.&nbsp; then i start training on tuesday.&nbsp; busy busy.

other than that, its the same ol same ol.&nbsp; unpacking, grading, taking care of the animals (who are just so cute), spending time with dad, writing, reading, and stuff like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

god bless!"

"event","and i know that sounds bad since i myself am i woman, but i cant help but to be frustrated with women at this point.&nbsp; with all this leif crap, and now with stuff with the apartment complex, that i think i need to go somewhere totally away from people all together.&nbsp; because people are just really pissing me off right now.&nbsp; and im not able to stay silent anymore and let crap run over me.&nbsp; im pissed.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","ok, so i just got rid of the last entry.&nbsp; too many people who i did not know were writing crap, and i just didnt want to deal with hearing any more of it.&nbsp; and that david h kid wrote back who only wrote to say mean things to cody during his break up, and he does not know me or anyone involved, so once he started writing interfereing in what he does not know what is going on, i just changed the entry to being private.&nbsp; ugh.

but, anywho...&nbsp; my electricity bill is a whopping $112!&nbsp; oh my gosh!&nbsp; thats so much money.&nbsp; yikes!&nbsp; its the air conditioning, i think.&nbsp; well, that would be the most reasonable thing.&nbsp; i have to keep it not sweltering hot in here because of the animals, though.&nbsp; and yes, for my own well being.&nbsp; katie gets cranky when she is too hot.&nbsp; i dont even want to see my qwest bill.&nbsp; i will have two months i will be paying for this bill.&nbsp; and each month is like $110 itself.&nbsp; even if i had ""enough"" money, it would never seem like enough.&nbsp; it just seems that finances are one thing to easily stress me out.&nbsp; at times that is.&nbsp; and right now things are looking up since i just got a job.

which about the job!&nbsp; i start my first day of orientation tomorrow.&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; ill get to meet people.&nbsp; and have a place to go during the days other than school, errands, and other stuff like that.&nbsp; but going to work again will be nice.&nbsp; it was nice to get to go with dad to his night classes.&nbsp; ooh and my night classes start soon!&nbsp; itll be nice to take classes about things that ive always wanted to take but never have had the chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

other than that, same ol same ol.&nbsp; my allergies are annoying during the monsoon season.&nbsp; but, i went running last night.&nbsp; ran until i could barely walk.&nbsp; it felt nice.&nbsp; i havent been able to run in so long, so it was great.&nbsp; yeah, it wasnt very long, but it was the longest that ive ran in a long time.&nbsp; im sore today.

god bless."

"event","<p dir=""ltr"" style=""MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"">ok, so another update on a happier subject. i finally got a job! yay! i am going to be a server at olive garden. it's not a job in education, but still, it's a job. it'll give me money that i need and a chance to meet people which is another thing i desperately need. its weird living down in phoenix and knowing primarily older adults. i know just a handful of people my age, and everyone is busy. it also gets pretty lonely when the only person i spend my days with is my dad. i love my dad, but i need to be with more than one person every day. it'll be nice having a place to go every day, get to see people, and get to do more than unpack and read. im excited for my job, though. i've worked at two restraunts before for a short time, so i am slightly familiar with things. this is my first time that i will have ever served. talk about money, baby! oh yeah! but, anywho... this is the olive garden over at happy valley and i-17 and is brand new. it hasnt opened yet, even. i am going to be one of the first staff members! it is so beautiful inside. and huge! ive never seen an olive garden that beautiful before. so, things are looking up. finally. this has been the worst month and a half of my life.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />last night sucked.&nbsp; i turned on my dishwasher for the first time, and after about 3 minutes, water came jetting out of the dishwasher and the sink completely filling my tile floor, getting all over the top of the counters, and soaking the carpet.&nbsp; it took me a good 30 minutes to mop up all the water in a small area on the tile!&nbsp; i called the maintence guy with this emergency, and since things were almost dry for the time being, he said to not turn on any of the water in the kitchen, and he'll come over tomorrow (which was today).&nbsp; it turns out that there was a leak in the piping under my sink, and so he just had to replace it.&nbsp; it was an adventure, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />i completely broke down last night after all of this happened.&nbsp; last night, that was.&nbsp; this past month and a half has been horrible, and it just seemed like things just kept getting worse.&nbsp; im strong, but a person can only take so much!&nbsp; after talking to dad, i felt better, but it was a hard night.&nbsp; today showed me that things are starting to look up.&nbsp; i have a job, so that is a good thing.&nbsp; nothing will ever stop me, no matter how bad, but it can get tough on me.&nbsp; i am super strong, though.&nbsp; i can handle it.&nbsp; all of it.&nbsp; </p>"

"event","i just got an annoynmous comment on my last entry.&nbsp; i deleted it because it was lame, and i know who it's from.&nbsp; she is doing everything possible to make leif hate me, have me hate him, make me believe he has moved on, and believe that we are not right to be together.&nbsp; ha!&nbsp; its very obvious it is her because it was annoymous.&nbsp; being threatened with harrasment charges and threatened to be sued for libel is lame.&nbsp; very lame.&nbsp; if he doesnt want to talk to me and has moved on, he will tell me himself over the phone.&nbsp; we are still engaged from the last time we talked.&nbsp; he said the only reason he left was because he wasnt sure about himself and his decisions and he wasnt confident in himself.&nbsp; he didnt leave because of us.&nbsp; and even though this certain person wants me to give up and admit defeat and believe he doesnt love me, that wont work.&nbsp; im way stronger than she thinks i am, and everything she is saying are excuses, lame threats, and lies.&nbsp; and i have proof of one of her lies, too.&nbsp; ooh, another thing she didnt know about me.&nbsp; i save things.&nbsp; ha!&nbsp; and she doesnt understand that once leif finds out that she has threatened to sue me he is going to be pissed!&nbsp; it is obvious that she is trying to scare me and does not want me in leif's life.&nbsp; well tough luck- i know different.&nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","it was awesome! totally awesome! it was so weird to see the characters on the big screen. they were huge! probably the best part of the movie was ""spider pig"". (seen the previews and you'll understand.) and before hand was probably the most fun ive ever had waiting for a movie. they let us in the theater at 11pm. two guys brought three beach balls, so we were hitting them around like in a stadium. and there were so many of us that it was great. and this one guy started a round and the wave. it was so much fun! all of you have to see the movie! <br /><br /><br />on another note, i want and need at this point to talk to leif. there is just so much going on in my head and heart that i think i am going to go crazy at this point. and one thing people dont understand, well one person in particular, is that i am a strong woman who is not to be messed with. i was watching ""monster in law,"" and it reminded me so much of the situation going on. <em>""i want him to be happy"" always seems to be the reason mother in laws give for destroying their son's relationships. they are happy! why cant parents just let their kids go on with their lives and not interfere? why cant they understand that interfering in the kid's lives is making things worse in many</em> <em>ways? it may seem as though you are ""helping,"" but the best way to help is support them, not tell them what to do, and let them make decisions for themselves.</em> my mom controlled me most of my life, and she thought she was doing what was ""right"" for me. when i had a breakup with a guy, she didnt let me talk to him after and pounded it into my mind that i shouldnt. but, thru time i realized that it was important to talk after and clear the air. and there were relationships that i wanted to work thru the problems and get back together, but she would not let me. she would monitor my phone calls. and back then i wasnt into email. and she thought it was all for my own ""good"" since i would complain and bitch at times. it actually hurt way worse and made things way worse because of the fact she wouldnt let me do what i knew i needed to do.&nbsp; and the thing is, thats what is going on here.&nbsp; (in my opinion.)&nbsp; <em>i just wish that he would stand up for himself and me and us.&nbsp; he is a very smart, confident, wonderful man&nbsp;who does know what he should do without anyone telling him to do.&nbsp; and he needs to understand that he can make&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;for himself, and the decision to marry me was the right thing.&nbsp; and im not telling him what to do here.&nbsp; i just want him to know that he did make the right decision and doesnt have to doubt that.&nbsp; he made the decision a long time ago, and even though things may be hard right now on figuring out the future, he knows in his heart that we are meant to be together.&nbsp; the heart always knows what it wants.<br /><br /><br /></em>and on another note, i had another job interview today at olive garden.&nbsp; i have a second interview tomorrow.&nbsp; i think i did really well and have a good shot at the job.&nbsp; im frustrated that ive applied for over 60 edu jobs and have only gotten 3 calls back.&nbsp; 2 of which were not right.&nbsp; ugh!"

"event","in my opinion...  i might be taking a pause to write in here for a small bit.  it just all depends.  currently, in my opinion, i am possibly facing charges of libel because of things i have written in my livejournal for a certain person who, in my opinion, hates me.  anything i have written in here has been all opinion, and whenever i may have said something mean, it was just me getting out of my frustration of the past happenings.  in my opinion... everything has been my opinion.  and being charged for libel because of opinions can not, in my opinion, happen.  you know what, screw it.  im not letting someone who, in my opinion, hates me to stop me from doing one thing i love that is giving me solice throughout this time.  ha."

"event","Lately I've discovered that I like fine arts so much better than design. The reason I could never figure out which area of design I want to go into is because I truly am not crazy about any of them. I miss painting, its the only thing in the arts that I've ever really truly enjoyed more than any of the others. I used to do lots of photography too, but I find that I really don't miss it that much, and perhaps never cared for it that much. I love abstract painting, coming up with random designs/ideas/shapes/colours that usually have nothing to do with anything, that only I can understand. I miss just going crazy with paint and coming up with fun things from random accidents. I've always known this, and yet I went into design knowing that I would probably have more of a chance of getting a job with it and hoping that I could learn to like it just as much. And I do like it, but I don't think that I will ever like it quite as much as painting. 

What's really worrying to me is that every summer when I get a bit more free time than I do during the school year, I try to get back into painting, and I discover that I suck now! None of the stuff I do is half as good as any of the stuff I did in high school, it is so upsetting knowing you used to be good at something and you aren't as good anymore. And I know that it is just because I'm out of practice and that if I were to do it more often I would get better, but with WHAT TIME? I definitely don't have time when I'm juggling design practicums. And even when I have time, sometimes I find that I don't want to work on it just because I get discouraged at how much I suck now compared to how I used to be...*SIGH* I really want to get back into it though, as nice as design is it is, making a pretty ad for a bar of soap or something stupid like that is just not the same as coming up with something that is truly original and truly your own creation."

"event","How on earth did PCs ever become the preferred platform? HOWWWW? I don't understand!!!

I have spent exactly 6.5 hours today trying to figure out how to insert a flash movie into a power point presentation that was created on PC (for work). Its working fine on my mac, its just this stupid retarded platform that's giving me hell. I've lost count of the number of times I've crashed. My mac has not crashed as many times in the past month as my brother's PC has in the past 2 hours. PCs can't play SWF files apparently, unless they're in a web browser. After checking around on the internet for numerous hours, I have concluded that there is no such thing as flash player for PC, only a flash plug-in for a web browser.  Power Point doesn't accept QuickTime movie files (thank you again, microsoft!), and trying to convert them into windows movie (AVI) files causes them to look like shit. Merely selecting the ""import movie"" option (a logical step, I would think!) to import a movie on PC power point does not work! It works on a mac, but on a PC, one must do a whole other shitload of complicated things to make one's movie play (things that you would never EVER EVER EVER even think of doing and would never even know about if it wasn't for technogeeks who post random tutorials on the internet. That's one good thing about PCs, they must give techno-geeks and trouble shooters a lot of business! My power point is now finally working - except for one small detail...in order to get the movie to go back to the beginning after the presentation has been played, I have to close and re-open the file! ARGHHHHH 

I doubt all my technical rambling makes sense to anyone...however the point is: there's a reason these computers are cheaper - THEY SUCK! GET A MAC!

"event","So I'm leaving the country in a few weeks for the rest of the summer, and instead of getting to enjoy my last little while here, relaxing and preparing for my trip, I will be running around like a madwoman finishing off random design projects. I have been designing a frikkin LOGO for Scadding and this other prof for SEVEN weeks, no joke. It looks pretty good, but not seven weeks worth good...I feel like I've been going around in circles, and sure it is for kind of a signinficant thing (its a logo for an international conference on space exploration), but still, they're being WAYY too picky with stupid little design nerd details that no normal person would ever notice. Added to that, Scadding was away for half the time, so in his absence Sandra and Angela took over and gave me critiques that conflicted with his critiques! In the next two weeks or so (before July 16th...though I could stretch it until the 21st if I REALLY had to...) I have to make the logo into a splash page for the organization's website...sounds like a very simple task but I know that they're just gonna over analyze and over critique this one as well and make me do 2000000 versions and go CRAZYYYYYYY.

Today was really funny because I was supposed to (FINALLY) get paid for my work...well I did get paid...boy did I ever get paid! We had agreed to a rate of 12$/hour at 200 hours, which was the total amount of time they estimated I would spend on the project. Since it is too annoying to keep track of my hours and pay me a weekly basis as I do most of this work at random times at home, I guess they just decided to pay all of it to me at once (12$ x 200 = 2,400$...not too shabby considering I've only worked like 95 hours so far and may not even work 200). Well anyways, I opened the cheque and instead of it being a cheque for 2400$, it was for 3500$!!!! I just stared at it in disbelief...whoa...York is S-T-U-P-I-D!! How do you pay someone 1100$ BY ACCIDENT? I wanted to cash it sooo bad...and everyone told me I just should...but alas, it is a LOT of money that I didn't earn so the goody-goody in me is telling me to be honest about it it and tell them to fix it. I know I know, York is a bastard that overprices everything and steals our money all the time and I need the money more than they do...but still, stealing is stealing, even when it is from York. So that's my decision about that...I know I'll probably get laughed at for it...but what can I do ;). 

Added to this stupid project that is going nowhere I have more work stress from another design job. <a href=""http://www.imprintcanada.com"">Imprint Canada</a> , a company I've been working for on and off for the past year needs me to pull a website AND a 16-page brochure about one of their upcoming trade shows out of my ass before I leave for Europe as well. Actually, I haven't told my boss I'm going to Europe so he probably thinks we have more time...hmmm maybe it would be a good idea to break the news sometime soon!!! Thankfully design standards at this company are so low that all they ever do is oooh and ahhhh at just about EVERYTHING i do no matter how bad it is, so it shouldn't take too long for me to come up with something that they are happy with. But still..I hate doing shitty work. 

Did I mention I have a third job? I also lifeguard once in a while. THANKFULLY all my shifts this summer are replacements, which basically means that people call me at random hours and beg and plead for me to work for them and I can always say no if i don't feel like it. :P"

"event","I turn 21 on Sunday, which depresses me more than anything else because I neither look, act or feel 21. Another year has gone by and I am older and hopefully more experienced and wiser...though I question how true that last statement is. I look back on the past year and don't even know what has happened in it or how it has gone by. I do know that the main event that sticks out in my mind from the past year is ending a 2-year relationship and being really depressed and frustrated for months after that, almost as if my whole world had just collapsed and I had to start rebuilding from scratch. I realize I'm being a tad dramatic here but at times I felt so lost I literally did not know what to do with myself...my life just began feeling so empty. Its a loss I've recovered from, but all my (what's the word I'm looking for...) right, DISASTROUS, attempts at dating ever since then have left me wondering if I will ever feel the same connection that I once felt with anyone else ever again. As happy as I am for people around me in relationships, sometimes they also depress me because a lot of relationships seem to be based on trivial things like looks, status and having a good time once in a while, and I begin to wonder if it is really that hard to find something meaningful where you don't care about stupid things like how cute the person is, how rich they are, who their friends are, how good they are in bed etc. etc. etc. It seems that a lot of people will judge one another based on superficial criteria alone and it really depresses and almost sickens me. I've noticed that the kinds of people I'm drawn to, be it guys or girls, are never the ones that are conventionally good-looking/popular/successful or whatever, but the ones that seem like they're truly wonderful, interesting people that have got a heart of gold. My first reaction to  model-look-alikes is usually ""so what?""... and really what is so good about them? the fact that they were born with certain genes that cause them to look the way they do? the fact that they have a lot of money and spare time (that could be much better spent!) to make sure their hair is always perfect? why do any of those things deserve my attention? I dunno...I lost my train of thought....and I'm tired, I guess I'm just really aching for something real right now. Hmmm... I really don't know how to wrap this up...I was considering making this a private entry (and still might) but I guess I'm also curious about people's responses."

"event","The number 1 place I get hit on is the TTC. I get asked out more on the TTC than I do in bars, clubs, parties, classes and basically all other places you can think of combined. I have lost count of all the guys that have ever hit on me on the TTC. I even went out with a guy that I met on the TTC, for 2 years. But today was the mother of all strange TTC experiences, because I got hit on ...by the BUS DRIVER! OH man, I was laughing so hard...First, he MAJORLY checked me out when I got on the 60F bus at Finch (checked out to the point where i was starting to feel uncomfortable). Then, throughout the entire bus ride to York (a bus ride that lasts 20-30mins) I swear to god he was checking me out in his rearview mirror and grinning at every stop. No I am not imagining things, it was a fairly empty bus, I was one of the few people sitting near the front, and it was pretty apparent where his eyes were travelling to...I must admit I kinda looked back several times, I was a bit curious... Then, as if i needed further confirmation, when the bus stopped at York and I got off, I saw him still staring at me walk across the street from the bus with the same creepy, goofy, weird grin on his face..and then a minute or so later, I actually saw him get off the bus and start to follow me me across the common. I heard him yell something like ""Hey...nice day isn't it?.."" but at this point i was starting to get pretty creeped out/uncomfortable and almost panicky (he was a friggin bus driver!!) so I was just ignoring him and trying to run across to the TEL building as fast as I possibly could and using the most roundabout route that I could think of so that he couldn't just follow me and pretend to be going the same way. (though the 4 inch heels I was wearing did not help my running).

Actually, I don't know what's funnier and/or sadder about my story - the fact that I got hit on by the bus driver, or the fact that I was actually considering hitting back for a while! (Sure he was probably in his 30s, and a bus driver...but as far as bus drivers go he was kind of cute...). Oh man, I think the fact that I am even CONSIDERING TTC bus drivers should be an indication to me that i BADLY need to get laid. LOL. 

That was on the bus ride TO York today. On the bus ride FROM York, I got asked out YET AGAIN by some grad student. (I declined, mostly due to the fact that he had lots of GRAY HAIR, which is an indication to me that he is way too old for me. I refuse to date anyone over 25, MAYBE 26. I'm sorry but these pervs should go find someone their own age). And he was nice enough, but..meh, just didn't feel right. But that leads me to another interesting phenomenon...why is it that, on days when I get hit on, I never seem to get hit on by just one strange creepy old guy, but a whole SUCCCESSION of strange creepy old guys? Is there some vibe that I give off on particular days? I've been trying to find patterns in the ways i dress/act on days when I get hit on a lot, but I can't figure it out. If I do give off some vibe to strange creepy old guys, what the hell is it, and how can I get rid of it? (Or better yet, how can I direct it at hot guys my age, not creepy old guys??)"

"event","So my boss at Imprint Canada, where I am employed as a freelance/inhouse graphic designer has not been giving me ANY work as of late (I haven't determined if he's unofficially firing me or if there is legitimately NOTHING for me to do there). Anyways, this, coupled with the fact that I NEED MONEY for my upcoming Europe trip has forced me to revert back to begging for hours at my old horrible job as a swimming instructor/lifeguard, and I am remembering why I hated it so much. Its really not the snotty kids, or the snottier parents, or the hectic pace, or the or even the cold water (though I do HATE the cold) that truly make this job unbearable. I could deal with all that. It is the ridiculous, absurd work politics and the fact that I am forced to work alongside people whose presence of a brain I am seriously doubting.

Today: I got called to come in on an emergency replacement. The manager that was on duty actually lets the assistant instructors sit in the office and jerk off while they're getting paid (and getting paid quite well, might I add), while I'm out in the pool teaching (and working twice as hard as I should be to cover up for the fact that I have no assistant instructors helping me!). No, I'm giving him too much credit: not only does he LET them sit in the office and jerk off, he actually sits in the office and jerks off WITH them.    

Ok, whatever. I can live for a few hours without help, I figure. Until, I get stuck with a group of 5 pre-schoolers that were so hyperactive that I physically could not move fast enough to keep them all in one place. I wave at the manager and assistant instructors jerking around in the staff office to come help me. I do this for a good 5 minutes, and they don't even look up. Finally, I get the other assistant on duty (who was somehow miraculously actually in the pool at the time) to go fetch the one that's jerking around and tell her to come help me. 

So when...lets use a code name here like...oh i don't know..stupid bitch? That's a good one. So stupid bitch finally makes her way out of the office, walking as slowly as is humanly possible (actually I didn't even know it was humanly possible to walk that slowly). Takes another five minutes getting into the water (but not before tying her hair in a crazy intricate knot on the top of her head to ensure that not a single drop of chlorinated water touches it). Throughout the duration of the lesson (30 minutes) I have crazy pre-schoolers running around everywhere (and I mean EVERYWHERE), and she makes a point of doing everything I ask her (and these were difficult, draining arduous tasks, such as fetching pool noodles) slower than is humanly possible and with as much attitude as she could possibly muster up. At one point I snap at her for being slow, (because she was talking to another instructor while my entire class of pre-schoolers was waiting for her to return with a bunch of pool rings we needed to use), and she actually leaves my class to go gossip about me to someone for 5 minutes. At one point I get the crazy pre-schoolers to go down the water slide, and a kid almost drowns because she was daydreaming instead of making sure that they go down the slide one at a time (such a difficult thing to do, i know!)     

I guess I deserved all the attitude she was giving me, I mean just because someone is paying her, that doesn't mean that she should actually have to do anything to earn that money! Come on, she is entitled to a salary merely because she is gracing us with her presence at work! Stupid spoiled princess. Actually, I think that not only should she not get paid, she should be paying me to put up with her incompetence. What is it that she is getting paid, like 9.50$ per hour or something? I think of all the poor people I know that work crappy 7-8$/hour jobs at retail and fast food places, that actually DO work hard, and here this bitch is getting paid so well for doing practically nothing, and she has the nerve to STILL complain and give me attitude! Fuck, she should could herself lucky that she even has a job, because there are many people that desperately need jobs and would love to have an opportunity to work and make money.  

But ALL OF THIS does not piss me off as much as the fact that, chances are, at my workplace, she will not only get to keep her job but she will also be promoted. This is due to the fact that my boss (who, by the way, is so incredibly obese that she would probably earn more money at a travelling freak show than she does managing swimming pools) does not recognize hard work (such as mine!) AT ALL, and only responds to one thing: ass-kissing. She will make some people's (mine!) lives miserable, while bending the rules for others SO much that it is not even funny. And the kinds of people for whom the rules get bent for are usually those who act like the above-mentioned stupid bitch. 

Well anyways. Wow, that actually took a lot of effort to write. Don't I have more constructive things to do with my time? Ah well. Hope you all enjoyed my rant."

"event","Something I was made aware of this past year, that has really started to impact the way I view producing art/design. I've often wondered why - although art is the one thing I love so much and could never live without, and all of my other interests somehow relate to it, i often don't like to actually do it all all that much. I like to look at art books, read design magazines, go to galleries and the like, but when it comes to actually producing my own work I start to hate it. The reason for this random post is that I was just doing some random sketches, partly as a cure for my boredom on a crappy rainy Sunday, and partly because I want to produce a (very small) canvas at some point this summer that I can lug over to Vienna to give to my grandma when I visit her. 

Anyway, the point is, what I've come to realize about art-making, whether it be drawing/painting/designing/photography/whatever, is that the reason I hate doing it sometimes is because I always feel that everything I do has to be good, and that if I produce something that is crap that it is somehow a direct reflection of me an my capabilities. I'm sure everyone who's ever done anything art-related has had this problem, but it is ironic that the desire to produce good work actually hurts your work, because you end up spending more time worrying about whether it is good or not than you do thinking about the piece itself. 

Another thing I've noticed while interning is that when you are actually working in the design industry everything is so collaborative anyways, and clients/art-directors/colleagues all get so much say in your work that the very idea of a piece of work that is ""your own"" becomes completely irrelevant. And everything is always so open to change at any time that it doesn't matter if you've been working on a concept/idea for 1000+ hours and are completely in love with it, if your superiors/colleagues/clients want something different then, guess what, chances are you're gonna be doing something different. So it really makes you question the logic whole idea of work that is ""your own"" and ""personal"" because in the industry you are a hired service that produces artwork that makes consumers/clients happy, not for yourself."

Ughhh...I'm just getting frustrated at Wishart. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, I don't know if I'm doing something right, basically because I get NO direction on anything whatsoever! They expect me to come in and know what the fuck I am doing, as if i've been working there for months, not 5 days! And when I screw up on something I got no fucking direction on (like today) I get yelled at! Its really annoying because I was hoping to a. learn something and b. make a good impression on these people in hopes of making connections/getting a job/getting referred someday, but its so hard to do either when I get treated like I'm a. dumb or b. invisible. I keep trying to stay positive, and it hasn't been all bad, and I do understand that they're too busy to help me all the time, but I still feel like I should be getting a LITTLE bit more direction! I mean, I do come in every day, ready to work for them, for free, you'd think they'd want to take advantage of it? *sigh* i don't know. I don't know if there is anything more I can do to better the situation."

York is a scary and deserted place to be on a Saturday night.

I need to be doing homework right now (but then again when don't I?)

I just realized I have spent 3 years in school, and what do I have to show for it? A portfolio full of crap, with maybe 1-2 pieces that are actually not crap, but not amazing. I am going to be graduating next year, but not before I produce more crap to put in my portfolio. I have nothing that I am absolutely in love with, that people would look at and say ""wow, that is an amazing piece."" Even my best design piece never gets an amazing reaction from everyone, and most people that look at my work respond with ""oh, cool"" I still don't know which area of design I want to go into, truth be told, I'm not crazy in love with ANY of them. I can't do anything multimedia related worth shit (I seem to be missing the part of my brain that allows me to do multimedia projects and design websites that actually don't suck, and taking time-based this semester has just confirmed that fact). As for print - I can't do advertising coz I can't be witty, I only like packaging if its really high-end stuff and not cheesy food packages, i don't mind editorial but I'm not in love with it, I can't illustrate worth shit, I'm not crazy about photography - wtf exactly CAN I do?? Oh, and I HATE corporate information design with a passion as well, so that's out. And I have actually taken all these courses so I'm not just bullshitting when I say I don't like stuff. I've always been a design/art person so its not like there's anything else I want to do with my life, but I have just never been able to figure out where I fit into this vast design-art spectrum. I mean some people can say ""I'm an illustrator"" or ""I do motion work"" but I have no fucking clue - I just do everything and none of it well. And I only have a year to figure it out. AHHHHH.... And design also stresses me out and pisses me off so much that I have no time for other areas of my life, and then I begin to resent it and resent myself for not having a life, and start putting less effort into it, and then my pieces end up sucking even more, and then I get even more mad at myself for the levels of crap that I produce..*SIGH* Its so hard not to beat yourself up sometimes..."

1) didn't offer to pay for a $1.50 cup of coffee (not that the guy should always pay, but it was only a 2nd date)
2) actually had the nerve to ask if I was going to cover HIS coffee!!!!!!
3) talked about bullshit
4) talked about more bullshit
5) flat out insulted my ""interesting"" accessories (yeah i have weird jewellery, that's me) - apparently I'm ""trying too hard.""
6) flat out half-jokingly insulted my hair (its too big apparently) and made a comment about - did i ever consider blow-drying it to make it straight?
7) made a comment about how his buddy called Valentine's day a ""day to buy your girlfriend chocolate so that she'll get fat and you'll have an excuse to dump her"" 
8) made repeated comments about how guys these days are too metro and wussy and how men should be more masculine and not talk about their feelings (but what he doesn't know is that I was in love with a wussy metro guy for 2 years - hahaha sorry Rob but its kinda true :p) (edit: guys who say things like that are usually tiny as hell also)
9) volunteered absolutely no personal information AT ALL - seriously, how the hell am i supposed to get to know this guy when all he does is recount south park episodes?
10) was too wussy to hold my hand properly - i got this crappy one-finger-hold thing (and yet he talked about how guys are too wussy!!!)
11) gave me the crappiest goodnight kiss known to man (yeah yeah, i didn't feel like rejecting his attempts to kiss me a 2nd time) - not that there was much of a kiss!! After staring at me for a good 10 seconds he finally worked up the courage to give me this tiny peck that lasted for approximately a nanosecond!! ughh! That's how you kiss a cousin! (and kissing my cousin, or even my cat, would probably have been more enjoyable than that!!)
12) Oh, as he was leaving he said ""try not to miss me too much when I'm in Vermont next week"" (uh ya, i'll try!!!)
13) Oh I almost forgot, some of his crappy jokes consisted of saying things like ""haha I'm turning you on aren't I"" or (as we were playing air hockey) ""try not to stare at me too much""

Maybe because I have really never met anyone so hilarious in my life...he genuinely does make me laugh a lot. Ah well, as long as his funny jokes outweigh his lame jokes. 

Anyways, we're meeting for coffee tomorrow at Empress at 8. (Familiar territory for me, as my group of friends has pretty much lived at that second cup since high school. Its like our ""central perk."" Oh...all the things that have happened in that second cup *lol*). Ah well, if he tries to attack me or something I'll just run to Flo's house, its only 5 minutes away :) hahaha.

And we're not meeting at school this time..*gaahhh*. So that means I actually have to tell my parents about him. I can't just say ""I'm going to school....for...a project...."" Which is annoying coz my parents don't seem too comfortable with me dating. Even though I had a boyfriend for 2 years. Funny how that works. 

Anyways, why am i not working on my portfolio right now? Instead,  I am getting worked up over a 2nd date with a guy I never really liked that much on our first date (but decided to give another chance, because i'm just such a great and wonderful person, lol). But if i'm still not feelin it after tomorrow, that's it. No more chances. As much as I hate being single, crappy guys only get crappier with time. This i promise."

"event","I guess a Harper win should bother me....but strangely I'm not too frazzled. I guess I figure, we elected the liberals 2 years ago, and its not like anything really changed with a minority government, so its not like the conservatives will be able to do anything with a minority government (and so many NDP seats! YESS!) There is a monkey-man on a farm in Texas right now that I'm sure is jumping for joy...But for the rest of us, the government will probably just remain powerless figureheads that scream and yell at each other all day in the house of commons but never actually pass any legislation.

But what does bother me is that there is not a SINGLE conservative riding in either Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver! All the conservative ridings are up in hicksville somewhere - so basically the hicks are running our country. And plus, how does the population of those three cities compare to that of the rest of Canada? I'm not sure on this, but I have a feeling that a lot more people are represented by those three urban areas than by all the little farms in saskatchewan and alberta somewhere. I'm not trying to put down country folk, I just think that both urban and rural populations should be represented.  

Also, I'm really big on international politics and I think leaders should be elected for what they're going to do on an international scale as well as locally (eg. African aid and the environment comes to mind). Canada has so much that we should be able to be more active in helping the rest of the world. But I don't think that a lot of people in Canada see it that way, and especially not the people who voted conservative. I find a lot of voters in Canada tend to be ignorant of the rest of the world and only vote for whoever is going to cut taxes for THEM and give THEM more money and such.

Anywways, if anyone reads this then sorry if I offended anyone with my political views. You can argue with me if you'd like. But that's that, and now I'm off to do (you guessed it) design homework! (3 practicums was a bad idea!!)"

Can't they be a LITTLE more creative? and plus, don't they think that we've already done this enough times by the time we get to 3rd year??

Also, why the insistence on having everything nicely typeset/printed in colour/on gorgeous expensive paper/bound in a fancy way/with fancy covers? I feel like i spend more time ""designing"" my projects than actually working on the content. Even some stupid 5% assignment (such as the whole ""pick a package and analyze it"" thing that i am working on right now for packaging), you know there's gonna be some overachiever in the class that went to loomis and bought a 20$ worth of paper and made some crazy 3D cover/package that's gonna make you feel like shit in comparison. Well, I shouldn't talk, I can be a complete overachiever myself, but only when it comes to concepts/ideas/actual real work, not fancy paper covers and binding. 

And now everyone's starting to expect us to do written documents/proposal in InDesign/(Quark for me, as I don't have InDesign STILL!!!) (if anyone wants to give me a pirated copy.....). Why can't I just use Word like normal people!? Oh right, I'm not normal people, I'm a ""designer.'

Also, why did EVERY single one of my practicums this week (3) result in a ""lets get EVERYONE to present their shit to the whole class"" deal...which inevitably lead to me sitting through 3 hours of presentation in each class x3 = 9 hours of presentations that I wasted my life on this week. And 6 of those were today...
Added to the 1 hour that Wojtek wasted discussing how to organize folders and how to use arrows to make a movie play in Final Cut Pro (arrows! who woulda guessed! genius! I could have never figured out that one myself!)...seriously, has anyone ever taught this man how to stop talking?

Seriously, a city of a million bazillion people + HORRIBLE urban planning (well, more like the lack of urban planning...) + snowstorms is NOT condusive to...welll..sanity! I left the house at 7 this morning for my 2 Sheridan classes.  I made it to York (which is only 10km away from my house) at 8:15 just in time to RUN LIKE HELL to catch the next fun part of my trip...the GO bus from York to Sheridan. Ah, the joys of a joint program. You get to get stuck in traffic commuting on 2 different routes! And the fact that it takes me 1h 15 to travel 10km on our retarded TTC system is beyond sad! 1h 15! I can run 10k in less than an hour! (and I actually have proof to back it up! LOL). So I catch the GO and make it to Sheridan at 9:30 Half an hour late for my class. After a commute that lasted 2.5 hours!!!! The option to drive was there as well, but I am not suicidal enough to want to drive in this insane weather. Anyways...enough on that....
So i go to class, listen to useless bullshit, blah blah blah pretty standard, get work back, get a crappy mark on a project i put minimal effort into (no surprise..but who could blame me when I had another zillion projects to do at the time). Anyways....what was even more fun was the journey home!
So I get on the GO at around 5:10 (after RUNNING LIKE HELL to catch it AGAIN because it was on time for once....I love how the GO is only on time when I'm NOT on time for it!)...and guess when I get to York by? 7:30!!!!! 2.5 hours from Sheridan to York! From square one to York the bus was literally moving at walking speed....if there were people crazy enough to be walking outside in this weather I'm sure they would have been much faster than that bus! 
So once I get to York, at 7:30 no less, I decide, hey, I have about a half-hour's worth of work to do in the labs...might as well do it now to save me from another hellish commute to York tomorrow. But of course, half an hour was not half an hour (is it ever?) at around 9 pm my work still isn't done, and i finally decide, hey, maybe i should go home once in a while. Looks like I'll be going to York tomorrow! 
So here I am outside AGAIN at 9pm, pretty much being blown over by the wind, there is a HUGE lineup for the 60 (big surprise), the bus is crowded as hell, people pushing me, trampling my portfolio case full of projects that only took 100 hours to make, waiting for the cummer at finch...waiting...waiting (edit, once I was waiting for the Cummer bus and this sweet old lady next to me turns to me and says ""Hey, why do they call it the Cummer bus anyways? It never comes...."" LOL!!! you don't get much cornier....). Anyways, it finally comes, crowded again, people pushing me and trampling my design projects again, but somehow I make it home...
oh and the funniest part of the story is...as I'm wallking down my street, about 3 houses away from home, my mom pulls up in her car (she was coming back from her Thursday Yoga class) and says ""hey, get in the car, I'll drive you home"" *sigh* I'm touched to think my parents care so much.....   
Oh and what time did I finally get home you ask? 10:15.
Anyways, that's the rant.

Leave it up to mandi to figure out how to pull that one off.....Anyways, I have a fun day of homework ahead of me for a change...(somehow this isn't fitting in with my whole ""do work less"" resolution) ok ok., I promise myself that I will at LEAST stop doing homework in time to watch the new Simpsons and Family Guy in the evening (I've even been missing TV shows because of homework!). Oh my god its soo annoying...why am i such a perfectionist, i should just make up a pile of shit at the last minute and hand it in, school is TOTALLY destroying and taking over my life (and has been pretty much since 1st year! Though somehow it is more pronounced this year...maybe coz Rob's not around to force me to stop working once in a while...well, gotta force myself. Anyways....ummm think that's it.

 Oh, and noone is done exams until the 20th, and my bro's not done til the 22nd! Sucks! (I'm done on the 13th...a fine arts major really pays off when it comes to exams - you can't have exams in drawing/designing lol). *sigh..what am i going to do..Its weird you'd think i'd miss my brother less and less, the more he was away, but i miss him more. And his exams end so late he's only gonna be home for like 2 weeks before he has to go back. My parents might be going up to Ottawa next weekend, but hell i can't go coz I have like 4 things due next week. Maybe I could get them to postpone it? Oh well, i guess we'll see. 

Ok i'm actually done now ...homework time. (again)"

"event","-Art of China midterm on monday (sooooo boring!! how is Chinese socialist realism, communism, Tiananmen square and any of that crap relevant to..well...anything??) ughhh well i guess at least i'm ""learning something new and different in art history."" Oh who am i kidding this class is boring as hell. Maybe once we get into doing the older historical stuff it'll be better.
-Image and Influence midterm on Wednesday (also boring as hell! I mean I like design history and all, and I like how the prof talks about architecture, interiors, and crafts instead of just boring old graphics stuff that i'm used to learning about....but having to memorize every single art nouveau artist/craftsman including the city they worked in and names of different friggin lamps and chairs just in case they show up on a friggin slide is another story!)
-have to finish drawing out all the characters and numbers for a friggin FONT for type (most boring, long and tedious thing i've ever done)
-have to pretty much RESTART project 2 for comm, because of the psychotic ""doug-like"" (hahaha) teacher who makes you keep changing everything.
-Speaking of Comm, we're doing 3 projects for it at once. Ughh she's CRAZY...this class is crazy.
-Plus I have an Image and Influence essay due in 2-3 weeks or so...so I should probably get some books from the library and at least figure out what the hell i wanna write about. 
Oh well. I'm going to the movies with mishi tomorrow. I shouldn't be considering my workload, but I need some social time. That'll probably be the only fun I have all weekend. I'd like to go out more, but probably won't have time. Oh almost forgot, Tony wants me to get cracking on the TICS website at work too! Lovely, how is it that during the summer they have nothing for me to do, and now they're busy as hell! But I have to do a semi-decent job and act like i can handle it at least somewhat, because I really wanna keep working for him as i definitely do NOT want to go back to teaching swimming! 
Anyways, this was just a venting of my frustrations before I go back to reading about avant-garde art in China, so anyways, its time for that."

I am so sick of this shit. I can't eat, I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep, I drink coffee like there's no tomorrow, I look like a fucking skeleton (lost 5 pounds last week alone, haven't weighed this little since i was 12), I have a 8:30 class tomorrow and I promised myself I would get some sleep (I was actually in bed at 10:45), but I am still not asleep (big surprise). I've tried everything, I've tried friends, family, hobbies, work, even tried hurting him to make myself feel better (hmmm shoulda known that one wouldn't work) but everything just brings me back to this crappy state. He probably hates me for the million and one insults I sent him and is probably dating that one-night-stand chick, or someone else, or who knows, but for being the dumper I am sure taking this pretty hard right now. I don't know what I fucking want, i don't know if I wanna talk to him, not talk to him, be friends, pretend he doesn't exist, hate him, miss him, think about all the girls he's slept with since we broke up....I don't know if i should call him, not call him, i dunno if he'll tell me to fuck off if i did, basically i just want to do whatever the hell will get me out of this crappy state. I don't wanna feel like this, I am not asking for much...all I want is the ability to ingest non-caffeinated substances into my body and the ability to sleep back again. *sigh* All I have around me are growing piles and piles and piles and piles of assignments around my computer that i keep procrastinating with (highly unusual for me), and hours and hours and hours and hours of depressing alone time at home during which i sit around and try to do do the fucking assignments. I should spend more time with friends, and I am trying to, but I can't exactly be going out all the time if my work's not done b/c then i'll feel even more guilty and stressed out later on. Home is depressing and I miss by brother. Maybe its time for another day-trip to Ottawa."

Why? I have to get up early, drive my mom to work, and go in for like half an hour, all because of a fuckin TYPO that was on the invite to the Toronto show that we didn't spot last week. It needs to be printed by the time they get back from Calgary next week, so i basically have to go in for the purpouse of fixing the TYPO and re-ftiping it to the printer.

In other news I had a fairly decent day...I saw Lindsay after 2.5 years of not being in touch! It was so cool to see her again, I hope we get together again.
Also had a fairly long talk with Stef and her friend Sarah, and decided during the course of it that, hey, maybe getting a rebound guy is not such a bad idea after all. I mean, I've always had a thing against rebounds, (they're kinda icky, why use someone like that?), but i mean, if the guy actually knows he's a rebound and i don't do anything much in the way of physical stuff with him (because that would be gross and wrong, not to mention extremely hypocritical), then what's wrong with casual dating? I mean, I deserve some fun in my life after this fiasco. As long as it is casual DATING and not casual FUCKING *ahem*. Yeah, not as bad an idea as i thought. Mission: get Rebound Guy. HAHAHA"

"event","So i deleted my past 2 entries, for those of u that read them. Figured there was no point in pissing and whining about people with no morals and self control who hurt each other needlessly if I was acting like one by bitching publically. Which is not to say I'm not pissed. But I have better things to do than be pissed...

Like....my stamps project for comm!! I have spent about a hundred billion fucking hours on this project, I seriously can't take it anymore. this had better be a grade A portfolio piece that gets me ANY job I want! And at this point i'm not even sure it is going to be. ARGHHH all this time....design is so fucking hard and draining sometimes, i think i should have just like, been a teacher or something. All for three fucking tiny stamps!! I had to hand paint each of them TWICE because the first time I did them they didn't work out, and not to mention all the colour correction and photoshopping I am still working on. Oh dear.

I also just discovered that you can press (control +click) in photoshop as a shortcut to change brush widths! (i'm sure all you design kids knew that...but..) At least I have my lovely mac to work on stuff. Seriously, I was just thinking about it today, I never had that huge of a preference for macs (though i did get one), but after having to do intense work on our shitty PCs in the office I love macs SOOO much more!! Its sooo time-consuming to switch from applications/documents on a pc, the screen sucks, the colours suck, time consuming to open documents AND i don't know my keyboard shortcuts! Not to mention the FREEZING! With Macs individual applications crash, but the whole system never fucks you over and makes you wait for it to reset itself. 
Haha I also thought of this ad on the apple website that said ""Lose Ctrl. Gain Command"" Funny play on words...

man i'm such a nerd. Clearly I am procrastinating here by writing about bullshit. But what does one write in a blog anyways? I guess that's the reason i hardly ever update...its so impossible to think of something that won't piss people off, coz normally i only write when i'm pissed off at someone. 

Oh well. Comm time. Then work tomorrow. Wish me luck. (Sheridan is cancelled because of some Jewish holiday! In principle i disagree with closing the school for just one of the major religions....why not close it for muslim days and orthodox christmas and all other holidays as well then?

"event","well, yeah we broke up. I don't know if i shoud write about it up here since its gonna be pretty hard to come up with something that Rob isn't going to read and take the wrong way soo... yeah. that's it. 
Being single does surely suck...expect to see lots more of me on MSN and on this thing - i actually went on msn last night for the first time in months. I never understood why people use that thing, but when you don't have a guy to call every night i guess talking to random acquaintances on the internet is the next best thing. I wonder how long it'll be before my next relationship, this is such a crappy state.
I keep looking back and trying to see SOME way that we could have made things work, but so far i can't, i just can't find anything that would have made it worthwhile. 
Oh well, i guess this gives me a chance to spend time with friends, and actually forces me to talk to people at school and make new friends - i hate talking to new people sometimes, but now its either that or have no social life, since the ""boyfriend"" part of my social life is gone.
I just wish i knew if there was something i could have done to make it work, or at least if it wasn't going to work, i should have realized it after a few months, not after 2 years. It would have been less painful that way. I guess I kept hoping things would get better, that he would change, but they never did. I guess i matured a lot as a person over the past 2 years and really realized who i am and what i want out of life, and once i realized that it really hit me how different we really were. During the first year or even more we were just happy and carefree and excited about being in a relationship for the first time, but after that all the problems started and we really started to analyze our differences and all that - maybe the constant analyzing didn't help, but you can't keep having fun forever. Plus, it wasn't like i purpousedly looked for things that were wrong with him - i always tried to stay positive but so many things happened that bothered me, and if something really truly bothers me emotionally its not like i can help that fact.
Oh well. I'm happy with the way i'm handling this so far. I can look at stuff that reminds me of him and feel ok most of the time (its not like its a bad memory or anything). Or i'll feel a little sad but i won't burst into tears or anything. Or whenever i catch myself feeling sad and that i want him back, i'll just remind myself of all the reasons that it wouldn't work and i'll feel better. I would probably feel a lot worse if i thought there was a chance that it could work and i gave up on it, but i don't really think there is so i basically feel as though i dont have a choice. 
Well, part of getting back to reality is being able to force myself to stay on top of school work - hasn't been too bad so far, since schoolwork takes my mind off it...so anyways, speaking of that, its time to work on Comm2. 
I said i wasn't gonna talk about it...oh well, I don't think there's anything in there that can be interpreted the wrong way."

Summer was cool, but now school is here, and for some reason so are the relationship problems. This might be it, i really don't know. I don't want it to be..but i have to do what's right for me. *sigh* i wish this was easier...its not like there's any obvious reason we should break up, i mean he loves me and treats me well and all that and we definintely make each other very happy but i always feel like i'm not as into it as i should be, there's too many little things about him that bug me, i try to change him too much etc etc.  I know i deserve the best and i know i could probably do a lot better but I could also probably do A LOT worse. And honestly, i don't really see it progressing into something really serious. I mean, i don't exclude the possiblity, never say never, right? but its not like i'm counting on it or anything. Is it bad to stay in a relationship that probably won't go anywhere? its probably just wasted time and makes it harder to break up later on....but then again its a lot of fun and its not like i'm in any big rush to get married, and you never know 100% that it won't go somewhere.  Oh i don't know. i keep having to edit myself too because i dont' know who reads this crap. Message me if you wanna give advice...but don't get mad if i don't follow it :)"

I've had an insane few days that's not going to get better anytime soon. School is inhumane, i swear. It seems like every single inch of my time is taken up by homework. 
The last day of classes is december 3rd. Until then, I have to hand in:

1) A brochure for communication design (which i've barely started on...only have rough sketches and the copy) (worth 30%)

2) An event mark/logo thing for type (i think i'm about 80% done...I'll see if Richard approves of what i've got or if he wants me to change it on Friday) (worth 30%)

3) The design of the cover and front pages (eg table of contents etc.) for a book for type (again, barely started, and what i have SUCKS ASS!) (dont kno whow much this one is worth...i think between 15-25%)

4) Oh, this one's great: An exhibition design for 3D, BUILT TO SCALE containing information about a chosen profession. The point of the project is to figure out how to organize information in a 3D environment for viewers, i guess. Or to make me cry..either purpouse works. Again, i have an idea and a prototype model, but have i started building the damn thing? no. (worth 25%)

5) If that wasn't enough 3D work: I have to hand in a 3D design journal containing all the process work/sketches i have done for projects this semester...i guess to tell him about my ""personal learning experience"" in 3D design. What bullshit. Oh, and it has to be presented in a creative 3D format...woohoo more model building (*blarghhh.....)  (only 10%, thank god.)

6) Some sort of research assignment/discussion paper for Research in Design. I have no idea what it is considering how she hasn't assigned it yet, but its on the schedule. She's gonna assign it tomorrow. Again, worth 30%.

*Sigh* I'm too fucking tired...no-one in my program has been sleeping much lately. We're all in the same boat. Oh well. At least i'm getting some really good design work done this semester. Seriously, i'm on a roll when it comes to the quality of my work. Was really happy with my type brochure I handed in last friday, and the magazine layouts i handed in yesterday for comm. Annette was blown away :), if i say so myself! I just gotta keep going for a few more weeks...just keep it up..i'm almost done..!!!

I gotta go to work sometime today and bitch about my shift to sue. I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna get pneumonia or something like that, and i don't think its fair that i have to risk my health by being in that freezing pool for 3 hours. I asked one of the DA's to teach one of my classes for me on monday because i think i was about to get hypothermia. seriously. i could barely talk anymore, that's how cold i was. They did it for me, but i had to deal with attitude from my PM and a certain other instructor who had no business saying anything to me about it. They were all like ""whatever, its just cold, you just have to deal with it, if you don't like it get another job blah blah blah, we've all had shifts like that (yeah right, in my 3 years of working i have NEVER had a shift like that!!) What losers, they can all go fuck themselves.

Yes folks, in 45 minutes, starting at 4:15 and going to 8:30 I will be chasing horrible horrible mean snotty kids (and big groups of them at that) around a freezing cold pool that I am expected to be in for 3 hours straight (I still don't know if i can get worker's comp for pneumonia)....and trying to teach them how to swim. Of course nobody learns anything because there's like 10 kids in each class and 5 classes going on in the pool at a time, so everyone gets approximately one square metre of pool space to themselves. Added to that, the groups are huge and I have to make them swim one at a time so that I can watch them to make sure nobody drowns, so the average class consists of each kid doing about 8 half-laps (from the shallow end wall to the drop-off) and then the parents harrass me because i'm failing their children and why can't bobby move on to level 3?? and so forth...GRRRRRR....i dread this day with a passion...fully...HATE IT. 

Added to that i work with idiots that like to scream and act all ditzy in the staff office when i'm tired and have a headache at the end of my shift...at least i get a good volunteer that helps me a lot with my classes because the DA's on that shift are entirely useless (but then again aren't most DA's entirely useless? its pretty much in their job description). I'm never EVER working at cummer again. I SWEAR TO GOD. The classes are too big, the staff are losers, and sue treats me like crap and gives me horrible classes even though i've doing a really good job for her for the 4th year now. I have to get my York Mills shift back!! I gave it up because it was on the weekend, but now that i work on mondays all my homework just gets shoved to the weekend ....so i have no free time no matter how i look at it!!  And now that I drive, getting to york mills is no problems so the fact that Cummer is really close to my house doesn't mean anything anymore...

(now that i know when the exam is!!) msn-ed with mishi and esther for a bit...apparently we're going out on friday..(thank GOD i can finally see mishi! she's been like a ghost since school started!! lol that girl works even harder than i do)

hmm..maybe i'll go see how kerry's doing...go kerry!!! that man is so much better than bush, or martin for that matter...hell, he should come be our prime minister!!
later

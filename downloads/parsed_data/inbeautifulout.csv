"event","I am so HAPPY. Giddy, even. Why, you might ask? I feel empowered- I have actually accomplished things!&nbsp;I have actually DONE things for once, instead of sitting around and being depressed about not having the courage to DO them! I found this little card from last semester with information about a writing minor on it, and I actually read it, and it interested me, so&nbsp;I emailed my advisor (and CA 101 teacher) to see what she thought about it. She thought it sounded like a great idea, and asked to meet about it. So,&nbsp;I met with her today, and we talked about options...I may be taking summer classes to stay on track and not have to add on to what will already end up being 7 more years of school. Then, after talking about that, she suggested that&nbsp;I declare my major asap- right after our meeting, actually. Well, normally, I would've just put it off until another day, but I decided to go to the Seibert center and get them to sign off on it. In the process of that, I actually got to meet my new advisor and we had a talk about what exactly I was &quot;getting myself into&quot; with athletic training as a major. It's a huge time commitment and our hands-on experience starts pretty much asap, provided that after an application and interview we actually make it into the program. The time commitment involves working with teams- the ones here at school as well as high school ones, AND&nbsp;clinical stuff. If I make it into the program, there is a great possibility that I can start that kind of stuff this semester so that I can be assigned to a team next semester!!! HANDS-ON&nbsp;WORK&nbsp;AS&nbsp;AN&nbsp;UNDERGRAD! I didn't think I was going to get to do anything even remotely involved until I was in grad school! I think this is going to be a great community and a great opportunity to use my passion for fitnes and athletics! 

So, God willing, I will be an athletic training major with a writing minor that will go on to get her doctorate in physical therapy. The future is becoming a little less obscure, and I am EXCITED!&nbsp;God is SO good!!! I'm also trying to take some steps to get a Students for Life (pro-life) group here on campus, with a little help from a friend of mine in a similar organization from Bama!

It has been a BEAUTIFUL&nbsp;day!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","<br />I cried myself to sleep last night again. I have 18 more days before I&nbsp;have to go back to school, but just the thought of going back depresses me to no end. I've gotten used to being here. I've gotten used to being part of the family again, getting to see my old friends, being able to see Finley pretty much anytime he and I are both free. People accept me here- they <em>know </em>me here, and they're not a bunch of stuck-up trust fund babies who don't give me a second glance because sometimes I wear my pajamas to class and I have pink in my hair. I know that there has to be a reason that I am at that school. Private colleges like that don't just give away scholarship money, let alone a scholarship entailing tuition, room, board, books, and meal plans. I was meant to be there, I just don't know <em>why.&nbsp;</em>I haven't found anything that&nbsp;I'm passionate about there&nbsp;or&nbsp;a group of people I'm just&nbsp;<em>dying&nbsp;</em>to be friends with at school. Few things interest me, and that's another part of&nbsp;what's been keeping me up at night: something inside of me is dead [figuratively, of course]. I'm missing something-- something to <em>live</em> for, something to <em>work</em> for, something to <em>believe </em>in. I'm missing a cause. I'm missing out on my way to make a difference in the world. I'm not even sure how to go about finding it; I guess I always thought it would just hit me and I'd know by the passion I felt in my heart that this was what I was supposed to be doing. I'm not talking about my career or my major, because I'm pretty sure I know what both of those will be. I'm talking about something outside of that. <br /><br />I'm also missing God. I haven't renounced my belief or my religion or anything like that, but my spiritual life keeps getting more dry by the day. I have to force myself to do my daily Bible reading, and half the time, I can't even pay attention to the words. It feels like&nbsp;I have ADD or something. My prayers are short-lived and random. I trail off halfway in the middle of them--again, like I have freakin' ADD or something--or if it's at night, I just fall asleep. I know it can't help that although Finley is technically a practicing Catholic, he's not exactly in touch with God either. I don't get the impression that it's a big deal to him, and though my continued spiritual nonchalance is NOT his fault, his attitude is not helping. I don't do well balancing a boyfriend and a spiritual life unless I don't like my boyfriend very much, and I like Finley quite a bit. I need a lot of care--more care than the people in my life can give, and it's unfair to rely on people like Finley to fill in a gaping hole like that because it's not his job. It's God's, and I've strayed so far that I don't know how to come back. I <em>want </em>to be able to rely on God, I <em>want</em>&nbsp;to trust Him without a second thought, I <em>want </em>to want to pray and talk to Him. Something inside of me is inexplicably stubborn and tries to convince me that I can do it later. But what if there's no later?&nbsp;This also bothers me. Just because I'm young doesn't mean this isn't important. I'm not invincible, and the last thing I want is eternal damnation because I decided that since I was just a teenager, I could afford to push bettering my spiritual life off until I got older. Because what if I don't get older? I do not want to die anytime soon. I feel like I haven't done anything remarkable with my life and I really do think there's a plan for it and I'm meant to do something. I don't want to die, and God willing, I will live to a ripe old age and have a lot of cats. But it's no reason to ignore my spiritual life right now, and I know that. That's why it bothers me. I used to be so good about it and I felt so close to God. I don't know what happened or how it got to this point. I just want to get back. <br /><br />So, to anyone who's reading this, if there's even anyone reading it, your prayers would be much appreciated. Thanks."

"event","<br />Sorry to whine, but I'm tired. I'm tired of him being inconsiderate and I'm tired of me being predictable. The latter is the real kicker though--why is it that regardless of the fact that I can specifically predict what I'm going to do before I do it, I STILL&nbsp;do it? I can't even be just a LITTLE&nbsp;inconsiderate, can't even act for an hour like I don't care. I wish I could. Is that a bad thing? I just want some reassurance that I'm not making myself look like a fool, that I'm not in this by myself. Being sarcastic and tough can be fun and it does have its moments...but do I have to do that all the time? And if I'm going to be irritated, could I just stay irritated for a while instead of forgetting the minute he DOES text or call or suggest we hang out? I <em>know</em> I'm not a pushover; I <em>know</em> I'm not this easily manipulated. I'm a big girl with a life of her own. I do not need a guy, let alone this one. So why must I have my phone with me at all times, check it obsessively, get irritated when he ignores me for half a day, and then let myself think we have plans this weekend when apparently we most certainly do not? Yeah. I need some kind of boy/phone rehab. I'm crossing my fingers that I can go to Louisianna, and then I'm going to just leave my phone in my suitcase for long periods of time and pretend like it &quot;died.&quot; Or maybe not even try to explain.<br /><br />Dammit. I'm finished being a sap. I don't care what I have to do, but I'm not doing this shit anymore. Care less, go out with friends more. First step is getting the hell away from my phone."

"event","Oh, Finley.

This car thing is getting to be a real nuisance, and I'm sorry if I sound whiny for saying that, but it's the truth. You see, the thing is, every time we hang out, I have to go through the following:

1) Run the plan by my mom, which consists of:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Explaining in detail what we're doing [i.e. going to the movies at 7:10, then going to eat an hour &amp; 1/2 later, then coming back here]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Answering the typical rapid-fire questions, like: &quot;Is Finley coming here or are you meeting him somewhere?&quot; &quot;How is he getting home?&quot; &quot;Is his car EVER going to get fixed?&quot; &quot;Are you SURE&nbsp;it's broken?&quot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Defending you and your car situation for the 1236187236781236th time, which puts me on edge and gets her irritated.
2) Figure out how to get where we're going and what time I need to leave/be ready to leave so that I can meet you or be ready when you get here, and how long it'll take to pick up anyone else that I&nbsp;have to pick up.
3) Drive&nbsp;to said destination, which can be anywhere from 10-30 minutes away.
4) Figure out what time we need to leave so that I can not only make sure everyone else is on time for their curfews, but that I am also on time for mine...which rarely happens, and that stresses me out even MORE&nbsp;and my mom ends up calling me 12837123 times wondering where I am.
5) Drive 10-30 minutes BACK, plus however long it takes to drop everyone off, panic about being late for curfew, and drive myself home.
6) Go inside, only to have to defend you and your car situation&nbsp;to my mom YET&nbsp;AGAIN and answer more questions like, &quot;why won't Finley's parents fix his car? You'd think they'd get tired of driving all the way out here and back all the time&quot; and &quot;Why can't he get someone else to take him places?&quot; 

Fun stuff, right? A tank of gas lasts me anywhere from half a week to a week now&nbsp;if I'm lucky. I have no job to pay for my gas, and I'm technically not supposed to be using the debit card intended for use while I'm at school during my stay here at home. I haven't been picked up for a date in a looooooong time [ever, if you are only counting the time we've been dating], and I'm tired of worrying about making my own curfew while everyone else gets to just waltz into their houses without a second thought after being dropped off. I'm sorry, but I can't fully believe that you will seriously NEVER&nbsp;get your car back just because your parents &quot;won't help [you] fix it.&quot; I mean, really? There's gotta be more to that than you're telling me, and I'm pretty sure there is because if it was simply broken, you would've replied &quot;yes&quot; to my text of &quot;Is your car still jacked up?&quot; instead of saying &quot;We should talk about that later...it's complicated.&quot; If I'm going to have to go to bat for you against my parents every single time we go out, I'd like to be able to make sure that I'm defending someone who's telling me the truth--the WHOLE&nbsp;truth, not just a little watered down version of it. I trust you, and I'd like to keep it that way so that when I am put in a situation like the weekly ones with my mom that question the situation, I can solidly say,&nbsp;&quot;no, it really is broken. This is what's going on...&quot; and explain it in a way that doesn't seem so goshdarned SKETCH. There are just so many holes in this situation! I don't mean to pick at everything, but solid relationships are built on trust and HONESTY, and I'm just trying to make sure ours is getting a rock solid foundation, ya know?

So humor me. I don't care how stupid or embarassing the explanation is. I need a little more than what you're giving me. Please?"

"event","<br />Trust is such an important concept, and one that I have no problem wrapping my head around in some situations and such a problem with in others. For example, how I trust that other drivers are going to do what they're supposed to in traffic--something I really shouldn't do, because too often they don't--yet I have a problem trusting that my boyfriend, someone I care about deeply, does not, for example, drink behind my back and does not consequently get his friends to cover for him. I've never actually experienced any of the typical situations like cheating that would cause trust issues, so I don't actually understand why I worry so much. As far as I know, he's a fantastic guy and he really likes me. There is just this stupid little voice in the back of my head that is constantly questioning practically <em>everything. </em>The car situation, the drinking, the ex-girlfriend [cupcake mohawk girl that he failed to introduce me to when we were both standing RIGHT&nbsp;THERE], the constantly ringing phone, the reason he takes forever to reply to my texts or just never does... most of this is all stuff I can think of a perfectly reasonable explanation for, but I can also think of the flip side of it, too, if that makes sense. Mainly it seems to be a question of whether he's just plain oblivious that this stuff is sketch/irritating or he's actually much sneakier than one would think. And then also, I'm aware that he likes me, but he's a funny one when it comes to that. Again, trust--he's got a funny way of showing he cares, so I kind of just have to trust that it's there, even when it's not obvious. Difficult, especially in these early months. <br /><br />I'm trying to just assume the best and hope that God's got a plan for it all, but it's hard and I think the devil is having a field day playing with my head. :/"

It makes me laugh to think that I met you as a result of one of Katherine's whims and it turned out so well. The first time I met you, I'll admit, I was expecting things to be&nbsp;a little awkward, but surprisingly...it just wasn't. I liked the way you laughed so easily and the way you made me laugh. Not to mention, I'll admit that I thought you were pretty darn cute. The week that followed, I had my little bout with insomnia, but it was mainly just because I was so ridiculously happy I could hardly sleep.&nbsp;Cliche, I know, but it's true. <br /><br />Then, seeing you again when&nbsp;I came back home...haha, I was convinced that if you liked me before, you weren't going to after the bowling incident. That was so incredibly embarassing- I bowled a grand total of what, like 25? Not to mention that my pants were too loose and I was worried they were going to fall down. AND&nbsp;I forgot socks, oh man. But it was fun. It was fun just sitting there on the couch with you watching House and being late for curfew because we&nbsp;&quot;had to make sure that the baby lived.&quot; And of course, being asked out while already being late for my curfew and my really lame response of &quot;okay.&quot; I'm just glad you didn't hear that; I think &quot;yes&quot; might've been a better answer, but you know. ;] The mix CD&nbsp;was such a sweet surprise.. and the fact that we had just seen Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist was ridiculous. The music was amazing and I was about beside myself when I realized that you put the Wedding Singer song on there...haha, Katherine didn't get it, but it didn't matter because I knew. <br /><br />I guess it's the little things that get me, like the fact that you actually watched Bridget Jones' Diary and Say Anything, the mix CD, the way you can make me laugh even on a really bad day, the way you actually laugh at the dumb things I say, all the good morning texts I've woken up to, getting to spend Halloween with you and watching that really not-scary movie, and just being able to lay there next to you and exchange sarcastic comments, among other things. You are so <em>fun</em> to be around, it's ridiculous. And we like the same kind of music! <br /><br />Suffice to say, I like you a lot and I'm a very lucky girl. :]<br /><br />&lt;3,<br />Me.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

It's not just my family-- I miss my friends, I miss my room, I miss the Greenway trail, I miss feeling like I <em>belong</em>&nbsp;somewhere. I like my school, I like my classes; I just don't like feeling like I&nbsp;don't fit in. The thought of transferring actually flitted through my mind during this past bout of tears, but I can't. I mean, I could, but I prayed for guidance on my school choice and scholarship and I got a full ride to a choice private school--a school that I never thought I'd be able to afford. I'm supposed to be here, but I don't know why. I want to give up so badly, but I can't. <br /><br />I can't shake the feeling that I am just plain <em>lame</em>&nbsp;when I'm here. I have friends at home, so I'm not an unlikeable person, but here, it seems like everyone went ahead and grouped up already and I missed the boat. Between sororities, fraternities, sports, and honors programs, everybody seems to be snatched up already. I have friends at home, but I can't live for going home in between visits. That's not a life. I have a boyfriend now, but that's just a new development and it's not like other people who can lean solely on their significant other. He's got a life of his own, as it should be, and I&nbsp;need to get one of mine. <br /><br />But where? Soccer would be my preferred community, but intramurals are still several months away and I was okay in high school, but I wouldn't make a college team. I've never been much of a political/ social activist, so those groups don't really appeal to me. Sororities are both literally and figuratively out of the question. There's a service sorority here that's having its &quot;rush&quot; this Thursday and I was thinking about checking that out. It would just be really helpful to have just <em>one person</em> that is here at school and is solid and not already involved in something&nbsp;else. <br /><br />I need to find something that piques my interest. In the past, that's been mainly stuff with either athletics or sports. I don't know. I'm feeling very sad today, and I'm not getting any work done. I need to go running today, too, and I'm not feeling that either. The trail here kind of freaks me out because part of it is like way back in the woods and stuff.<br /><br />UGH. :("

I'm tired of eating by myself, although I prefer it to sitting down at tables full of unfamiliar faces where my presence either stifles the conversation altogether or is completely ignored. I'm tired of having rush be such a big deal here, or at least in this stupid hall. Whatever happened to &quot;70% of people here AREN'T&nbsp;GREEK&quot;? Tell me that. I'm tired of my face looking like it exploded; I'm tired of my acne meds making my face swell up like a chipmunk and making my face itch.

No one knows me, no one seems to want to know me, so why try to impress them? I seem to only attract creepers, whereas the nice guys <em>I'm</em> attracted to hardly notice that I'm alive. I'd say I want to go home, but it's not like I have a thriving social life there either. I didn't leave behind much in that area. It all kind of disintegrated over the summer and everyone has gone their separate ways.

God is so good.

Did you ever go to Disneyworld?
Just wondering.

"event","Dear&nbsp; you,<br /><br />It isn't until I notice that I've forgotten to think about that you that I think about you. You grow less and less&nbsp;the ambiguous symbol you were in my life; you are more of a thought and less of a real person. I have asked and have been asking for God to break any and all ties between us that are not of His will, and so far, I'm getting closer to closure instead of being pulled back to you. I'm taking it that there will be no ""trilogy"" for us, and for the first time, I think I'm okay with knowing that. For the longest time, you were a device, a ""button"" if you will, for Satan to push because he knew it worked. You were the bruise on my heart, the never-healing wound, the one thing I would have given anything to have. I threw situations around in my mind; I dwelt on what I could have and should have done; I looked at your facebook for signs of a change; and&nbsp;I essentially tormented myself mentally because you were the one ""safe"" entity I knew- or so I thought. You were only safe because the misery you&nbsp;induce is all too familiar and it saves me from taking a chance with someone else and risking the possibility of&nbsp;unknown misery. Knowing the misery never meant I was able to master it, but there was still a comfort in it- <em>maybe there's a reason I'm still miserable</em>, I thought, <em>maybe it's not over for good</em>. One day I had a revelation though: why would this particular misery be of God? What good was it doing Him? It was much more beneficial for Satan: first of all, it kept me miserable and defeated; secondly, it took my focus off God and put it on someone else; and thirdly, it kept me looking back at something subpar, which would cause me to miss the beautiful things God had in store for me in the future. You were Satan's biggest grenade, and I refuse to let him use it anymore.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would be lying if I said that occasionally, something that involves you makes me a little sad. For instance, yesterday when I was looking for pictures to put in my shadowbox and I ran across a picture of us from prom back in the day that I thought I had put in your scrapbook way back when. It is a daily fight, but God is taking the strain off of me. I just have to stop the thoughts as soon as they come in and ""take each thought captive"" to Christ. That was my biggest problem: I knew thinking of you made me sad, but it was an emotional binge- I didn't know how to say no and I didn't want to. It's hard to retrain that kind of mindset, but I'm working on it. I'm finally starting to come into my own- don't read that as I am always happy and never fall down, because that still happens often- and clean out my life a little. I'm happy to say that I think you will finally be one thing I will <em>not</em> be taking with me to college.&nbsp;<br /><br />As for now, I don't talk to people about what you've been doing- I prefer that I don't hear about it, and by the grace of God, Lydia decided not to tell me anything about ""Tortuga"" (thanks, Pookie :] ). I never visit facebook's homepage and I most certaintly don't seek out your facebook. I don't intend to visit Tortuga anytime soon. Maybe you did tell Sam that it bothers you that we don't talk, but I can't talk to you. I don't want to, and I can't because I have no interest in the kind of life you're living or the things you do. I'm not your tool anymore. Even if you clean up your life, I don't think we'll be talking. Much in the same way that alcholics cannot drink <em>at all</em> in order not to trigger their addiction, I can't have any communication with you at all. I have faith that I will keep improving and no-communication-whatsoever will not be necessary, but I would like to keep it that way regardless of what season of life I happen to be in. I won't be eating out&nbsp;of the trash can anymore.<br /><br />I do hope that you turn your life around, though, for your own sake. You were a good person, and you still are deep down. There's a happy medium between who you were and the change you felt you needed to make. I'm praying that you find it and that you find God.<br /><br />God bless,<br />Me.<br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<p align=""center"">Waking up with a headache is not the way I really wanted to start this day. I hope I didn't exceed the recommended dose of ibuprofen and am now suffering the consequences. I had terrible cramps yesterday though, so I took advil more frequently than normal. Any and all emotional responses are a little off because of PMS, or as Hannah is now opting to call it, CMS. I figured as much because everything's been amplified. <br /><br />You know, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little dissapointed. I've got less than three weeks before I go back to school and the only people I've really seen all summer are going back to school on Wednesday. It's difficult to leave here for something uncertain when I'm not even sure what I'll be coming back to, if anything. But I do have hope that I'll meet people at school- if nothing else, my shoes alone spark a conversation or at least some interesting remarks.&nbsp;Until then, I'm still in limbo; not really fully here, and not really fully there either. I'm hovering somewhere in the middle until I get a push in the other direction.&nbsp; <br /><br />I've got 18 days, and I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing: prepare. This summer feels like it was all about prep- cleaning out the crap so there's room for the good. There's still some work to do.&nbsp;<br /><br />----------------------------------&gt;&gt;Edit&lt;&lt;---------------------------<br /><br />Today's accomplishments:<br />1) Running three straight miles at the gym for the first time in a month or so [generally I run my 2 in about 15 minutes, take a quick water break, and run the other one].<br />2) Having a great strength training workout based on stuff I learned at Bodyworks.<br />3) Getting the yard mowed today, even if it was during the hottest part of the day.<br />4) Cleaning out under my bed- getting rid of a LOT&nbsp; of useless junk [I found a check from '05 from the lady I STILL babysit for.. you never know what you will run across].<br />5) Singlehandedly pulling my whole bed out from the wall [and I mean OUT from the wall, as in the back posts were level with where the front posts were originally] and then vacuuming the floor as well as the floorboards under the bed.<br />6) I guess I can put singlehandedly putting the bed BACK against the wall as a separate accomplishment.<br />7) Remaining as even-keel as one in the throes of PMS can try to be.<br />8) Remembering that I have to be in bed by 9:30 for Mass tomorrow morning.<br /></p>"

"event","I'll admit, it's a little lonely without facebook. Why lonely? I don't know. I guess checking into other people's lives, even if that's not what you realize you're doing, has a sense of comfort to it. Besides, I've been checking my facebook while I eat my breakfast for a least a year now, and old habits are hard to break. I know it's healthy for me in the same sense that wearing sunscreen is, but it's still difficult. Not to mention I opened up my Bible to 1 Maccabees this morning to a story about Judas Maccabeus (sp?) slaying all these people, which I had a really hard time ciphering out. The most&nbsp;I could glean from the passage, along with the intro to the book, was that basically, God chose the Israelites and one of the Israelite heros was a guy named Judas, and the Israelites were supposed to repay God's favor by obeying his laws and worshipping him as their only god so that they could keep owning the opposing nations that threatened them. It wasn't quite as fun to read as Paul's letters or Psalms, but it's God's word, so I'm going to read it.<br /><br />I finished my first Christian book about dating, <em>What's a Girl to Do?</em>, yesterday, and started the other one today. Ironically enough, it's called <em>Marriable</em>, and if you know me, you know that I'm about as far away from marriage as you can get. Knowing this, maybe you're wondering why I bought the book. It's actually a book about Christian dating (NOT marriage, believe it or not)- the tagline is ""taking the desparate out of dating."" Goodness knows I've had my desperate moments (can anyone say <em>sophomore year?!</em> Yeah.) Anyways, the couple who wrote this met online, so I'm a little skeptical, but I'm going to read more into it. I'm also slogging through my book for school, <em>Field Notes from a Catastrophe</em>, or some other scintillating title like that. I'm aiming for 25 pages a day, and at this rate, I have about 5 more days (including today) of reading about global warming (exciting, am I right?).&nbsp;I'm really hoping that I don't have to write a paper or give a speech on what it's talking about or my feelings in regards to it, because most of it's going right over my head, no matter how many times I reread a given passage. The reviews in the front of the book call it ""easy to understand"" and ""well-written,"" but I beg to differ. Nonetheless, it has to get done, and I don't want to wait until the last minute.<br /><br />I went to my cycling class today- my first trip to the gym in over a week, due to the family vacation we went on, and oh, how I've missed my gym. I actually (you have to promise not to laugh... nevermind, I'd laugh, too- go ahead) got teary-eyed thinking about how I have to leave my gym when I leave for school. Sure, I'll come back and use it over Christmas break and next summer, but I want to keep taking my classes over the school year! I'm finally getting in some kind of tangible shape! I've been able to completely push my limits by taking multiple classes a day, i.e. Bodyworks and Cycling, or by doing a class on a day that I'm supposed to run, i.e. Aquacise and a 3-mile run afterwards. I've spaced out my weights so that I am now able to do leg weights (machines)&nbsp;every other day with arm weights (machines) and Shape's ""Bikini Body Workout."" I haven't worked this hard in months, if not years,&nbsp;if not&nbsp;maybe <em>ever</em>. No joke. And I feel awesome. I have a routine- a reason to wake up and not bum around the house until 2, or whenever I deem that I ""feel like"" working out. I just don't want to lose it. I've checked around to see if there are any gyms near the school- there's two- but the classes are way different. And if they don't have cycling... ACK. I've really grown to love that class. I even like Aquacise, despite the fact that I'm the only person under the age of 40 there.<br /><br />It's nice to be home, though, and it'll be nice to get back into the gym routine.&nbsp;<br /><br />My shirt and bracelet for To Write Love On Her Arms (an organization I just found out about- it's great) should be coming in sometime in the next 2-8 days. I'm excited first of all for getting the shirt and bracelet and second of all for the sheer joy of recieving a package! This week may prove to be a little crazy- I keep thinking it's Monday and that I need to be in the bed by 9:30 to get up for Mass, but it's not. I still need to call my neighbor back in regards to babysitting this week (hopefully it won't interfere with gym time.. yikes). I've got an appointment with my counselor tomorrow, I <em>do </em>have to be asleep by 9:30 tomorrow night, and I need to call my hairstylist and reschedule my hair appointment. I think I'm finally willing to lighten up my hair a little- do NOT read that as going back to ""blonde""- a) because it's getting a bit boring, and b) because my eyebrows have lightened up and my hair is now too dark. I'm keeping the pink streak, though. I've thought about changing it to blue or purple, but she already has the pink at her office and I don't want to make her have to run out and get something new.<br /><br />We'll just have to see, I suppose.<br />"

Instead of getting on facebook in the mornings when I eat my breakfast, I'm going to read the Bible, read my other book, and update my journal.

Come on, it's me you're talking to
There's something going on inside of you

You always hide behind yourself
You walk a lonely road with no one's help
I hate to break the news
You're headed for a fall

(CHORUS)
And if I have to jump
Then I'll jump 
And I won't look down
You can cry, You can fight, 
We can scream and shout
I'll push and pull 
Until your walls come down
And you understand I'm gonna be around
I'm sticking with you

Even if you try and shut me out
I'm staying here 
'Cause that's what love's about
I might let you down,
But I won't let you go

So lean into me, I want to know
Everything about the fear you hold inside
'Cause you and I are better then just one, so

"event","First of all, thank you for the uplifting comments and good advice. It was much needed and came at a good time.&nbsp;:]<br /><br /><br />Recently, I've come to a couple of realizations, the first of which is:<br />1) I am NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, <em>NEVERRRRRRR</em> going down to Bama. EVER. Not to visit, not to go to games, nada. I will stay as far away from that mess of a school and all the drunkards I know that go/are going there as I can.<br /><br />Secondly:<br />2) I have no desire to talk to half of my ""friends,"" save my guy friends (minus Wolfie), Lydia, Laura, Katherine, and the other underclassmen. The others... the others make me sick, to put it plainly. The kind of life [lives] they're living are not for me. I don't drink, and I don't like spending the large majority of my time with people who put getting drunk high up on their priority lists. I also do NOT belong to the ""we've been going out for 129837198273123 months"" club, nor do I wish to belong to it at this point in my life. I'm not 30. I'm just starting school- starting the rest of my life, for gosh sakes! Having arguments about whether I want a one story or a two-story house, or where I want to LIVE after <em>graduate school</em> just seems pointless to me. I guess I'm just on a whole other page.. hell, maybe even in a whole other book.<br /><br />But you know what? THAT'S OKAY! I no longer have to put up with crap daily and in person! It can only irritate me via facebook, and to have it NOT irritate me, I'd have to chuck at least 20 people of my facebook. Oddly, I'm actually considering that, or at least kicking Scott off of it because I'm sick of seeing his face everywhere.&nbsp;Maybe they'll regret what they're doing one day (not because of me chucking them off facebook, ha, but because of their life choices), but I will be long gone by the time that happens, if it ever does.<br />"

He'll be 5-7 hours away, depending on where I am. It could be worse, I know, but right now I feel like my heart is being ripped out. I don't even&nbsp;care if that sounds&nbsp;cliche because it's accurate. Mom tried to talk to me, but it ended in a stupid lecture over why ""Sex and the City"" is an inappropriate movie for me, unless I want to fill my head etc. with crap.&nbsp;I'm sure you can guess how well that went.

I treated myself to a yummy mandarin chicken salad from Bruegger's, along with a special treat of Hazelnut coffee (I even went all out and got a medium size, ha). I thought today merited a consolation meal. Sadly, I hardly felt like eating it, and halfway through my salad, I lost my taste for it. I haven't even finished my coffee, which should tell you how upset I am. On the bright side, I had another session with Lisa this morning and it went well. Those sessions have become part of my saving grace, and I'm thankful I have them. I have&nbsp;a feeling I'll spend most of my next session in tears. How many times can I write about being sad?&nbsp;

My head feels a bit clogged. I have a pile of tissues beside my bed- probably the reason for the clogged-ness. I'm going to go running later at the gym, mow the yard, and then hopefully go running with dad. I may just wind up like Forrest Gump, minus the running-across-the-nation thing. I'll just run more. I'm going to have to find some kind of a game plan.&nbsp;

"event","Have done something to not let my trip to T-town end so miserably. Almost every day, that situation plays itself back in my head, and every day, I find at least 5 things I could have done differently. That was a perfect opportunity for a beautiful surprise, and I got the surprise, just not the beauty of what it could have been. Why I ruined that for myself, I'll never know.&nbsp;

Have swallowed my pride and flung myself at Scott when he came back into town (as in, hug him as soon as he came in the door). Two days is just not enough time to sit back and pretend to be collected.&nbsp;

Have TALKED. Why did I have to be so serious all the time? He was my boyfriend, not my shrink.&nbsp;

Not have avoided Patrick the week after Penny's quince. My PR side should've tried to clean up that mess and reconcile, but I just wouldn't do it.

And that's only the beginning. Not a day goes by that I'm not plagued with things that I should have done. I know it's not healthy, but half of my spirit seems to live in the past, wishing she could have been a better person. Naturally, my obsession with my terrible past behavior SHOULD make me want to be a better person now, right? So I&nbsp;SHOULD be acting like a better person now, right? Except that I'm not. I live my life like a hermit when I'm not in school, consistently snap at my family (and they are all so sweet to me even though I know I don't deserve it), complain about the SMALLEST amount of work, put in half the effort I should when working out, am extremely nonchalant about my boyfriend to the point of being rude, and I cry so much I can't even stand myself.

I swing from absolute misery to being resolved to change to being utterly complacent and back, so on and so forth. If there was a way for me to step outside of my mind for a few hours and not be subjected to my own overly-complicated THINKING, I would do it. I mean, really, if another PERSON was driving me crazy, I could just hide from them. I can't hide from myself (so cliche, I know) so I seem destined to be driven insane by my own thoughts. I've taken to having some more out-loud conversations with God in my car again, and that's relieving some of the tensions of my thoughts, but it's still not as natural as it used to be. It's helping me get a few things out that I haven't been wanting to realize- one of which being that I do miss Scott. Yes, it's sad; yes, he's a jerk; yes, that was six months ago. I know all of that. It makes no sense to me, either. But it's this little pocket of hurt that just won't go away, and I don't know how to make it leave.

It's going to hurt seeing him if he comes to graduation (and doesn't talk to me or look in my direction, which he won't) , but it's going to hurt worse if he's not there. If he doesn't show up... that means that he really and truly doesn't care. At all. And that would be worse than having to be in the same room as him.

"event","You know this whole thing about having a crush on someone you've known for 13 years? I thought it was nice-- it's not. I swear, I think he's avoiding me. And now I keep picturing myself being that annoying, loony type of person that tries too hard (writes too much in facebook comments..), stares too obviously, and shows up in all the wrong places. The kind of person that a friend would put up with in an attempt to be nice, while really panicking because they want to tell you that you're nothing more than a friend. ACK. Things were going so well, too! Or at least I thought they were.. goes to show what I know. I used to feel like I had an ace in the hole, that things like this were a type of challenge I could master once I found the right strategy. Now I'm just timid. I hang back. I don't think I have what it takes. One little move that seems like it's serving to push me away and bam.. I'm gone. I've learned all too well not to hang around when it's pretty obvious that I'm not wanted. I'm not going to risk being in that kind of a situation again.

I'm stuck in the middle at the wrong time and in the wrong place.

At this point in life, most people are either happily single or have been dating for-freakin-ever. I'm single, but I would like to have a chance at a relationship. God knows I don't deserve it, but I want to have that chance. I just feel like I've run out of time. ""You have college next year! You'll meet all kinds of people!"" Okay, maybe I will, but do you understand how much LONELINESS that will involve from now until then? And how easy is it for everyone to say that, considering they're all taken or married. Yeah, how would you feel? Honestly? You know it would suck.&nbsp;

I was actually really looking forward to prom, too. I thought it would be special. Now, not so much. I feel like a toy with a defect.&nbsp;
There's no miracle cure. I'm shy, perpetually tired, acne-prone.. I have terrible roots that are now showing through and I don't even look decent when I put makeup on anymore. I don't even feel good in my clothes anymore. Even my favorite outfits. They look okay, but I don't feel good. I don't feel like anyone deserves to have to be burdened with me as their girlfriend. I've got too much emotional (and physical) baggage and I feel like I've aged 20 years since high school started. I can hardly muster it in myself to be crazy anymore. I just want to sleep all the time. At this point in my life, I honestly need(ed) someone who was accustomed enough to me that I could just fall asleep on them and they would help me chill out. But those kinds of things take time, and time is something I have very little of.&nbsp;

Happy couples make me want to cry. I just want to be one of them. I often find myself staring at them, which looks weird, but they're so cute that I can't help but observe. I want to be cute. I just keep telling myself that one of these days, one of these days.. I will radiate some nice perfume, like Body by Victoria; I will not have to rummage through layers of unnecessary junk in my purse to find a pen; I will have beautiful hair; I will be able to wear tighter clothes and be proud of my body; my face will clear up; I will become less socially awkward; I will spend less of my time worrying about time management and working out and pick up the ability&nbsp;to be spontaneous.. mainly, I keep telling myself things will be okay once I get to a point. And I never reach that point. It's the perpetual bone dangling in front of me on a stick. I don't think I'll ever reach it. The answer would be to get comfortable where I am, but I can't.

I feel second-rate, so I act second-rate. My self-esteem is nonexistent right now. I can't take a hit to save my life, and I cry over everything.

I wish things would work out with Cornflake. Or maybe just look promising again.."

"event","&nbsp;I've been searching for something to keep my sights on, but haven't had much luck in finding it. I really am a goal-oriented person, and right now, other than not eating crappy food and getting all my work done, I have no goals. People keep telling me that it's fine, we're graduating in four months and I'll find someone/something in college, but honestly.. that's a good four to six months away. Not to be impatient, but a little something to work for right now would be appreciated. I understand what they're saying, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a while away, and the people who're telling me this <em>have</em> their someones and somethings. I feel like such a wet blanket. I'm worried because I cry too much lately, and the crying is getting more sporadic-- usually I can confine it to when I get home, but I can't seem to. I can't explain it, either; half the time when ""it"" occurs (I have no real idea what it is- depression, hopelessness, misery, whatever you can call it), it feels like something is trying to wring me from the inside out. Anguish. It feels like raw anguish. And why? I couldn't tell you. It usually only takes one bad thing to set off the entire snowball, and then it seems as though the snowball preys on everything and anything I've been seriously upset over-- Scott, Danni, school, everything. The trigger event is like being kicked onto the ground, and everything that follows are the continual&nbsp;blows which render me too much in pain to get back up. It's made me weak; my defenses against whatever&nbsp;it is are terrible, and I just try to ride it out until the episode's over. I hate it because I never know when it's going to hit. Sometimes I can sense it and I try to prevent it, but it will inevitably show its nasty face. And it sounds so lame to tell people, and I hate it because I always get, ""well what do you want me to DO about it?"" The answer is that I don't want anyone to DO anything about it-- just understand that it's there, that it's real, that it's a going battle.&nbsp;<br /><br />The real question is for myself: what am I going to do about it? Meds aren't an option. From past experience, I'm not really sure a shrink would help. So what then? I'm trying to find a focal point (one that's NOT four to six months away, mind you), but as of right now, I'm about as much in limbo as Alice falling into the rabbit hole."

"event","&nbsp;Considering that I've fallen asleep just about anywhere I've sat down at, I'll try to keep this short.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to make of myself lately. I feel strongly about things, but can see myself doing something entirely different in my head should I be given the choice. My feelings are still sorting themselves out; they're still spinning around and waiting to land on one side or the other. For example: I spend Christmas break fantasizing over how nice it would be to have a boyfriend and how sure I am that a relationship with Patrick is something that I really want, only to get into the relationship and realize that either A) I can't have a relationship with <em>him</em>, or B) I just can't have a relationship right now. It might actually be a little of both. Either way, actually being in a relationship (even if it was just for a few days) made me feel like I was stuck in a small, dark space and I couldn't breathe. The feeling wasn't actually his fault; apparently, I have post-breakup commitment phobia or something. So after ""ending things"" yesterday, I felt ready to swear off all relationships and officially declare myself undate-able for a while, until I start finding myself having these strange moments of actually wanting to be in a relationship! I mean, what is going on with me?!&nbsp;<br /><br />I keep trying to figure out what kind of guy I'm looking for, but the honest truth is that meeting people that I know nothing about scares the heck out of me. What if they don't like me? I have little to no social skills and tend to be incredibly shy when meeting new people. My first impression may leave much to be desired. I'm not really involved in much outside of school (unless you count going to the gym, but I'm all gross and sweaty so I'm pretty sure I won't meet anyone that way), so the only way I really meet new people is through friends who kindly try to ""set me up,"" for lack of a better phrase. It's an enjoyable rush, the whole meeting-new-people thing, but set-ups are potentially really awkward (i.e. me and Matt at Starbucks... yikes). I guess that a little bit of awkwardness and being uncomfortable isn't really a significant price to pay in order to meet someone and at least if things don't work out, I won't have to see whoever it is at school.<br /><br />That's another thing-- I realized I really can't date anyone at school. I hate people being in my business and feeling like my personal life is under scrutiny at all times. I also would prefer to have a boyfriend be someone that I can look forward to talking to when I go <em>home</em>, not someone that I don't communicate with after&nbsp;I leave school for the day. Mainly, I just want to have fun and go on dates; I like to get dressed and go out. I don't consider myself high maintenance or expensive; dates can be fun without the guy having to spend a lot of money. It'd just be nice to meet an intriguing person that I could have some chemistry with, go on some dates, and see where that goes. Scott got me sold on the whole casually-date-first-then-really-date mindset, and I do think it's the best bet.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's usually bad form to go searching for something, but maybe it's coincidence this time? I just need to chill a little bit. My first concern is God, and if I focus on Him, things will fall into place. He will bless me with peace and patience until I find the person that's right for me."

I was supposed to wake up at 7:15.</li><li>I get to Mass about 5 minutes late and get stuck in between people I don't know, somewhere in the back.</li><li>I start to notice it's really, really hot in the church. And I start feeling sick. </li><li>THEN, I realize I haven't had any food or any caffiene and I think...&nbsp;well, sh!t, that's no good.&nbsp;</li><li>I end up having to leave Mass twice because I'm afraid of throwing up on the people around me.</li><li>Instead of having sympathy for me, my family proceeds to make fun of me when I get home.</li><li>And Patrick was not actually at Mass. Go freaking figure.</li></ul><p>That's after last night, which was pretty freaking dissapointing. I just don't see why someone as responsible as Patrick would tell me that he wants to hang out and that he'd call me the next day to make plans and then call the next day... at 4:45. After an hour and a half of talking and being indecisive about what to do, I tell him that I should probably go get a shower since I was at the gym before he called and he's like, ""oh. Well.. I don't think I'm going to be able to do anything tonight. I think mom needs me to help pull things back together around here. I'm sorry."" And I'm like, ""oh, no, that's fine. I'll talk to you later."" So I hang up the phone and spend the next.. I don't know, half hour crying my eyes out instead of taking a shower. Then I take a shower and keep crying for the next hour. For some reason, I just started remembering all the good memories Scott and I had and how we'd hang out and have so much fun before we even dated. Like playing basketball in the pouring rain, and swinging at the park at 11 at night, and going to see the midnight showing of Harry Potter... I know he's not who he was, I'm not who I was, and things got shot to hell after we started dating, but I don't think I can date someone who doesn't want to hang out with me, someone who doesn't take me out places. I like to have things to look forward to; I like to get dressed up and feel cute. I don't need someone to spend ungodly amounts of money on me, but I'd like to just.. I don't know, have movie night, go get coffee, walk around Providence... just hang out. I can't date someone like Thomas again.&nbsp;<br /><br />You know, as convinced as I am that I want to be in this relationship, I'm not sure I'm ready for all the shit it's going to entail.<br /><br />I can't deal with those missed phone calls.<br />I don't want to be dependent on a phone call.<br />I can't lose sleep again.<br />I don't want to get off the phone and cry again.<br />I don't want to NOT go out on the weekends.<br />I don't want to have a ""just at school relationship"" and never see the person on the weekends.<br />I want someone to be affectionate with me. Not crazy and PDA-obsessed, but affectionate.<br />I don't want to have to worry about other girls.<br /><br />I'm kind of just out here in limbo, doing what I do.. if I'm attached to someone else, that brings a whole truckload of crap and worries that I'm not sure I'm ready to take back again. I've been floating free and to have to come back down.. to have to take back into consideration the million possibilities and to have to go back into analyzation mode. I'm afraid of routine, I'm afraid of unhappy endings, I'm afraid of hurting, and I'm afraid of hurting someone else. I'm afraid of losing touch with God, I'm afraid of losing everything I've established since Scott and I broke up.. I'm just plain afraid and I'm upset. I'm as close to depressed as I've been since the black and white dance. I don't feel like doing anything. I actually feel pretty sick and congested.. I just want to sleep. And of course, this weekend would be the weekend we have all kinds of family running in and out of the house so everything that I do is completely public and open for criticism and comments. I hate it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know I'm being perfectly unpleasant and probably irrational, but I don't care. I'm going to wallow in it for a while.<br /><br />You know, really.. I just want to be somebody's baby. Lame, yeah. I know. I just want someone to be proud of me; I want someone to want to spend time with me; I want someone to be cute with me. I want and I want and I want, but I'm not sure it's in the cards. Ugh.<em><br /></em><br /><br /><br /></p>"

"event","I had the <em>weirdest </em>dream last night and thought I'd share.<br /><br />Apparently, in my dream, I had this pre-scheduled trip to Tuscaloosa planned out and Scott was going to come take me there even though we're not together anymore. So he shows up at my house... and he looks even more ridiculous than before: He has a GRILL, his fingernails are painted and have been airbrushed, he has a puffy yellow silk hat (like those newsboys hats, except this one looked like a yellow silk souffle), he's wearing a HUGE t-shirt and really baggy pants, and he's dusted his nose with some reddish-looking powder. I mean that in addition to his haircut and earring(s). Somewhere during the dream, JR ended up coming over and a bunch of other people kept walking in and out of my house just to visit him... and then he decided he wanted to cut his hair&nbsp;again...&nbsp;in my <em>kitchen</em> (that apparently I had just swept, because I was irate about it) and so he's in there, cutting his hair, and JR's laughing, and I think I tried to punch him or something. The whole time he's here, I'm cleaning like mad for some reason. Then at one point, he was sitting in my recliner while I was cleaning up the living room and he says something like, ""hey you- pick those magazines up!"" And I'm like, ""Excuse me? Who exactly do you think you are?!"" And he's like, ""What the hell are you talking about?"" So then I kind of break down and ask him what the heck is wrong with him and why is he so different. And then, he says to me.... ""Maybe you should ask Jay-z about it""<br /><br />Somehow that translates to he's trying to fit in with the ""hip-hop culture,"" except that looking at him, I keep getting an image of those Grateful Dead bears (I think that's what they are anyways). So I wind up sitting there with him, and he won't let me let go of his hands (not in a nice, loving way, but in a weird, controlling way because he's being a donkeybutt) and we're kind of getting along. That is, until I realize I can't go to Tuscaloosa because I don't know anyone there and I don't want to spend anymore time with Scott. I'm sad at the prospect of having to cancel my trip, but I have no reason to go anymore. I run into the next room and am practically sobbing as I'm trying to tell my dad and my grandma that I can't go-- Scott's changed; he's got painted fingernails, etc etc. And they agree, but a small part of me wishes I was still going, even though I know I'm going to be treated badly by him and his friends there.<br /><br />The dream ends and I don't know whether I told him that I wasn't going or not. Weird or what?"

BAH!

You don't let me down. I'm telling myself every freaking five minutes to <em>be patient- good things come with time</em>, but I want to see you.. like, now!

At least I would get to see you.<br /><br />&nbsp;It's really quite enjoyable being this crazy. The only real downside is that I talk too fast and I can't think of anything good to say sometimes.

A manicure? Jeez. But, this scholarship letter and the end of 2nd quarter art with pyscho woman is enough to merit a small celebration. I'm incredibly worn out, but I prefer this feeling to the crazy, out-of-control one I had earlier. Thank God for running four miles. Sometimes there's just no other positive solution.&nbsp;

Crazy, tragic, sometimes almost magic, awful, beautiful life. That about sums it up."

"event","&nbsp;Dear anyone,

Today is day 5 1/2 that I haven't been on myspace. Wait, before you laugh-- this is seriously a big deal! I can't seem to shut my myspace down because of some complications with the email address, so I've always had it around. My fingers would always type in the myspace url as soon as I sat down to a computer. Well, then Scott changed his profile picture and it didn't really go over too well (with me), and I decided that giving him myspace as an indirect way to bother me was stupid. So I gave it up. It'd be one thing if I just shut down my site. But I didn't shut it down; I just don't go to it anymore. It sounds silly typing it out, but it's another hefty change and I'm proud of myself for it.

Thanks for listening,
Me.

Dear boy,

I sure hope you're at Mass this morning. It's 6:33 AM and if you aren't at 7AM Mass, I have to say that I will be very dissapointed. On the plus side, I've got an idea for your present and I actually have part of it. I'm hoping to have it done by the end of the week, if work and exams go together okay. :]

Happiness,
Me."

"event","&nbsp;You know, there's a lot to be said for sharing a chair with someone, getting hit with pillows a million times, and getting sandwiched in an attempt that was supposed to stop me from getting in the door. I haven't laughed as hard as I have tonight since I was in the 7th grade. I love it. :] :] :]"

"event","Sitting here eating my oatmeal, I've got a million different things running through my mind.
I could douse my sorrows in Dimetapp. I could make myself throw up. I could go find some scissors.
I need some kind of physical relief, even if it's relief in pain. I'm trying my best to fade into nothingness, as if I could do it just by thinking.
I don't want to not be here. But, I don't want to be here at the same time.&nbsp;
I'm wondering how the world is still moving, how my sister can be sitting in the other room checking myspace like things are okay.
How is everyone going on with normal life? I feel like I've been stuck in a bad dream, and maybe tomorrow, I'll just wake up.
But I know I won't. Deep down, I know that this is for real and I've got to do something.
Good, bad, whatever. My body's already pleading with me. Why does it deserve to be damaged? It didn't do me any harm.
Should I diet? Should I work out more? Should I sleep forever? Should I find the scissors?&nbsp;
What is there for me to do that's going to make me feel like it's worth getting up in the morning?
I love my family, I love my friends. I just don't want to be goaded into picking myself up off the floor this time.
I don't want to. I do not want to. I want to lay here in the floor and let the thoughts run over me.
I don't want to have to dig deep and find my inner strength and pick up just because ""everybody else does.""
I want to lay down and have the world stop moving for a little while. I feel so much that it just washes over me in waves.
It's not an acute pain. It's a dull, throbbing ache that beats with every thought. They wash over me, and I just sit here.

Why couldn't you have taken yourself off the face of the Earth?
I hate you now if I didn't before. I'm weak again. I'm writhing in pain on the floor and you're standing there laughing.
What have I got to fight you with? You killed me already with the rush of things that could have been. That would have been.
No earring. No pompous swagger. Just holding my hand, dancing with me, wrapping me up in your arms. Was I not worth it?
I wasn't worth it. I wasn't interesting enough. I was too far away, too young, too willing to try to make things work.
The least you could've done was never come back so I could've kept telling myself I got off easy. You weren't supposed to be there.

You're my poison, and I can't stab myself to let you bleed out. You just keep coming back."

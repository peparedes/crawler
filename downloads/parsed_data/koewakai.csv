"event","Yeah so I'm in Oregon right now for Debate Nationals, which is awesome.

My partner Christine had to cancel at the last minute because of something for the National Guard, which sucks. So I didn't have a partner but Marcus (my coach) said I should come and watch anyway.
Well anyway, we get here and Marcus talks to Conrad Hack (what a name lol), who helps run the tournaments, and he said there's a spare debater without a partner here from Azuza College. They're a pretty good debating college. So now I have a hybrid partner which is cool. 

There are IRISH DEBATERS here!!!!!!! You all know how I am about people with accents... especially if they're Scottish or Irish. But yeah, they're from Dublin.. two boys and a girl. I haven't met them yet but we get to later today. There's three hours difference so it's only like 2:20 here. I'm soooooo excited to meet the Irish hotties!! *whacks head on desk*... Adam is amazing... :-P lol. But c'mon! They're irish!!! What happens in Oregon stays in Oregon. lol j/k. 

Oregon is beautiful by the way. I really like it. 

We went to Portland yesyerday and went into one of the biggest book stores in America. It was cool I didn't have enough time to go into all of the rooms. But anyway, Jess will appreciate this: I bought a figurine of a LESBIAN LIBRARIAN NAMED NANCY!!! It's the exact one Coach Tighe has. It says ""Complete with ultimate Shushing Action"" on the box. It comes with her own trading card. I haven't decided if I should keep it, or give it to Coach Tighe since his old one was falling apart. I was so psyched to see Nancy in the store lol. 

Well ok I'm bored now so I am going to stop writing. Just thought you people should know that I'm enjoying Oregon."

"event","Hm so here's the update:
 The boy is wonderful, absolutely amazing. The schedule SUCKS. The debating, AWESOME. The job, tedious. 

I guess it all balances out. I have no time to think though. I'm constantly going to class and doing homework and debate practice and going to my job in my ""free time"". Seriously, you know it's bad when you look forward to your job for some ""resting"" time. 

Debate update: San Diego next Friday!! Whoo hoo! California here I come! Feb 3-6. Leave Friday morning and get back Monday night. I can't wait. We're staying in a hotel right next to Sea World. :-)
 -Central Michigan is scheduled for Feb 23-26. Hopefully Eliza can come and see us, I told her about it. 
 - Notre Dame in Indiana is scheduled for one of the weeks in between (Feb 10-13) but I don't know if I want to go yet. I guess it's supposed to be a beatiful school but I don't know if I should be missing that much school, especially since I have 4 classes on Fridays (and one of them is a homework-checked recitation class). I'm still deciding. 


But anyway, other than that I'm counting the days till Spring Break. It's only the second week of school and I already can't wait for a break. This is bad..."

"event","Weeks been pretty much uneventful... monday went to my cousin's house in CT. Tuesday spent a couple hours with Dane and we went to Adams. Wednesday Dane and I went to Kyle's at night and played Clue and watched Family Guy and Futurama. Thursday Dane scared me by knocking on my door at 11pm; played Risk, talked, and drew till 3:30 am. Today, going to see HP 4 again with Dane(he's never seen it). Don't know if Kyle's coming or anything. Then probably back to Dane's so he can make his wonderful pancakes. Possible date this weekend(not sure if it will be a date or just hanging out though), but he has to call and tell me what's up first. 

Well that's it for my exciting life though"

"event","I thought those of us who have had the opportunity to be in a singing ensemble would enjoy this... I know I did.  GO ALTOS!!! :-D

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO THE SATB CHOIR In any chorus, there are four voice parts: soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Sometimes these are divided into first and second within each part, prompting endless jokes about first and second basses. There are also various other parts such as baritone, countertenor, contralto, mezzo soprano, etc., but these are mostly used by people who are either soloists, or belong to some excessively hotshot classical a cappella group (this applies especially to countertenors), or are trying to make excuses for not really fitting into any of the regular voice parts, so we will ignore them for now. 

Each voice part sings in a different range, and each one has a very different personality. You may ask, ""Why should singing different notes make people act differently?"", and indeed this is a mysterious question and has not been adequately studied, especially since scientists who study musicians tend to be musicians themselves and have all the peculiar complexes that go with being tenors, french horn players, timpanists, or whatever. However, this is beside the point; the fact remains that the four voice parts can be easily distinguished, and I will now explain how. 

THE SOPRANOS are the ones who sing the highest, and because of this they think they rule the world. They have longer hair, fancier jewelry, and swishier skirts than anyone else, and they consider themselves insulted if they are not allowed to go at least to a high F in every movement of any given piece. When they reach the high notes, they hold them for at least half again as long as the composer and/or conductor requires, and then complain that their throats are killing them and that the composer and conductor are sadists. Sopranos have varied attitudes toward the other sections of the chorus, though they consider all of them inferior. Altos are to sopranos rather like second violins to first violins - nice to harmonize with, but not really necessary. All sopranos have a secret feeling that the altos could drop out and the piece would sound essentially the same, and they don't understand why anybody would sing in that range in the first place - it's so boring. Tenors, on the other hand, can be very nice to have around; besides their flirtation possibilities (it is a well-known fact that sopranos never flirt with basses), sopranos like to sing duets with tenors because all the tenors are doing is working very hard to sing in a low-to-medium soprano range, while the sopranos are up there in the stratosphere showing off. To sopranos, basses are the scum of the earth - they sing too damn loud, are useless to tune to because they're down in that low, low range - and there has to be something wrong with anyone who sings in the F clef, anyway. 

THE ALTOS are the salt of the earth - in their opinion, at least. Altos are unassuming people, who would wear jeans to concerts if they were allowed to. Altos are in a unique position in the chorus in that they are unable to complain about having to sing either very high or very low, and they know that all the other sections think their parts are pitifully easy. But the altos know otherwise. They know that while the sopranos are screeching away on a high A, they are being forced to sing elaborate passages full of sharps and flats and tricks of rhythm, and nobody is noticing because the sopranos are singing too loud (and the basses usually are too). Altos get a deep, secret pleasure out of conspiring together to tune the sopranos flat. Altos have an innate distrust of tenors, because the tenors sing in almost the same range and think they sound better. They like the basses, and enjoy singing duets with them - the basses just sound like a rumble anyway, and it's the only time the altos can really be heard. Altos' other complaint is that there are always too many of them and so they never get to sing really loud. 

THE TENORS are spoiled. That's all there is to it. For one thing, there are never enough of them, and choir directors would rather sell their souls than let a halfway decent tenor quit, while they're always ready to unload a few altos at half price. And then, for some reason, the few tenors there are are always really good - it's one of those annoying facts of life.. So it's no wonder that tenors always get swollen heads - after all, who else can make sopranos swoon? The one thing that can make tenors insecure is the accusation (usually by the basses) that anyone singing that high couldn't possibly be a real man.. In their usual perverse fashion, the tenors never acknowledge this, but just complain louder about the composer being a sadist and making them sing so damn high. Tenors have a love-hate relationship with the conductor, too, because the conductor is always telling them to sing louder because there are so few of them. No conductor in recorded history has ever asked for less tenor in a forte passage. Tenors feel threatened in some way by all the other sections - the sopranos because they can hit those incredibly high notes; the altos because they have no trouble singing the notes the tenors kill themselves for; and the basses because, although they can't sing anything above an E, they sing it loud enough to drown the tenors out. Of course, the tenors would rather die than admit any of this. It is a little-known fact that tenors move their eyebrows more than anyone else while singing. 

THE BASSES sing the lowest of anybody. This basically explains everything. They are stolid, dependable people, and have more facial hair than anybody else. The basses feel perpetually unappreciated, but they have a deep conviction that they are actually the most important part (a view endorsed by musicologists, but certainly not by sopranos or tenors), despite the fact that they have the most boring part of anybody and often sing the same note (or in endless fifths) for an entire page. They compensate for this by singing as loudly as they can get away with - most basses are tuba players at heart. Basses are the only section that can regularly complain about how low their part is, and they make horrible faces when trying to hit very low notes. Basses are charitable people, but their charity does not extend so far as tenors, whom they consider effete poseurs. Basses hate tuning the tenors more than almost anything else. Basses like altos - except when they have duets and the altos get the good part. As for the sopranos, they are simply in an alternate universe which the basses don't understand at all. They can't imagine why anybody would ever want to sing that high and sound that bad when they make mistakes. When a bass makes a mistake, the other three parts will cover him, and he can continue on his merry way, knowing that sometime, somehow, he will end up at the root of the chord."

"event","Yeah so last night I went to see the midnight showing of Harry Potter 4. I felt special being one of those people who get to see midnight showings of movis when they first come out. 
We went to New Jersey to see it, seeing as all the philly movie theatres were sold out.
There were little kids there. TONS of them. For a midnight showing. It made me wonder if they were going to school today. 

The movie was pretty good. Probably the best one yet. The cast members all got hott. That was a suprise. The guy who played Cedric was GORGEOUS. And the Weasley twins weren't bad either. I was kinda confused on some parts (like where the heck was the cool dude Lupin??) and why at the end it was like ""OMG Voldemort's back. We're all gonna die!!! But first, lets go home for the summer."" But I guess I was told that it's pretty much like that in the book as well. Psh. lol

Well anyway that's my update. The movie was good. Hopefully you'll all enjoy it, as I'm sure you're all going to see it this weekend Im guessing."

"event","So I have another debate tournament tomorrow and Saturday at UPENN(University of Pennsylvania). I'm excited.. it starts at about 4:30 and is on the other side of Philly and will run till about 10pm. I was asked by the team captain (Christine Moyle) if I would be her partner. She's awesome. Justin (my partner for the last tournament) is also going and is paired with someone... who I don't know. Then there is a team of people we don't really know, but have been showing up for meetings. They seem cool too. So it's the six of us going. And I think it should be a blast. Christine is a senior and we've been debating with each other a lot at meetings so I thought it was cool that she asked if I could be her partner. 

Now apparently Christine says there's a debate party after at about 11pm. We're not sure if we're going, but I think it would be fun. Justin mentioned maybe going to it at today's meeting. But get this: It's themed. The theme? Underwear.
Yes, that's right... the debate geeks are having an underwear party, and I think it's hilarious. We didn't tell Justin this. Christine and I talked about making him go in his underwear lol. However, we will not be in ours lol. Maybe pjs, but thats about it lol. I'm sooo taking pictures. We're talking about the Ivy-leaguers in their undies... probably the future leaders of our country lol. Should be interesting.
If we don't go we talked about just doing something afterward instead. Don't know what, but I think it will be a lot of fun :-P

I'll keep ya'll updated.

I HEART DEBATE!!!"

But I aced my calc quiz and I haven't even been to class lately, which is cool. </P>
<P>I'm excited about going to Colorado. I can't believe it's next week. </P>
<P>I might be going to Six Flags New Jersey this saturday, but I don't know. I know Brian is skipping work to go. The word is that all the tickets are sold out... but I only need a space on the bus cuz I already have a pass and can get in free, so we'll see. </P>
<P>Brian plans on being a pirate for Halloween. He bought fake pirate swords for the costume and we were running around 1300 (his dorm building) with them fighting with them today. He's going to put the pic of him being a pirate as his facebook pic after halloween(which I'm going to take).</P>
<P>Today I did a photoshoot of him in his BDU's. Gotta love a man in uniform. ;-)</P>
<P>here's the pics:</P>

"event","<P>Ok so I am on Temple's debate team. You have choices to be either a basic team member and learn basic skills, or you can be a competitive team member, which obviously involves more work. Of course, I wanted to be as competitive as possible, so I informed the coach. </P>
<P>We do parliamentary debate here, which is two-person team debating on each side (like we did at Monson), except it's extemporaneous. Meaning the topic you are going to debate about is decided about 20 minutes before you debate it, as well as what side you're going to be on. There's no ""carded"" evidence, everything is in your head. </P>
<P>So yeah, yesterday I was approached with the opportunity to go to an upcoming tournament and I told the coach I was interested. </P>
<P>Guess what??<BR>I'M GOING TO COLORADO. :-D<BR>The last weekend in October. I get to leave thursday and miss class on friday. The tournament is at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.<BR>I'll be back for Halloween on Monday. Sweet!!</P>
<P>So today I met my partner. I was approached because he's been on the team before, is a competitive debater, and didn't have a partner for the tournament. His name is Justin Murphy and he's a sophmore and a political science and economics major(double majoring). He's pretty cute actually.. :-P. He's a libertarian (like me), and he LOVES to read... how cute lol. But yeah he's really easy to talk to and we and the coach spent today talking about topics and getting to know each other. I'm VERY psyched. It should be an awesome experience.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This is Justin:</P>

<P>He's the blondie in the front. He's cute in that dork kind of way, which I love.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But yeah... I am very excited :-D</P>"

"event","Went to the comic book shop in downtown philly with Jared and Brian. I got a batman t-shirt. 
Ate dinner with Jared, Jay, and Brian. It was lounge night apparently. AKA they had a live band, lots of decorations, and ""mocktails"" (nonalcoholic drinks) all in the cafeteria. I got a strawberry daquiri. Yum. 
Went to 1300 and chilled in people's dorms until the campus movie started at 10:30pm. Went with Brian, Jay, Jared, Lisa, and Brendan. This weeks movie was Mr and Mrs Smith. It was good(for the 2nd time around), but none of the ppl I was there with had seen it. The theatre was packed. It's a real one screen theatre. New, and just like at eastfield, except cleaner cuz they just built it this year. 
The cost? Tickets are $2.00. You can get your ticket, a box of candy (the ones they sell for like $3 at regular movie theatres), and a large soda (which is pretty large) all for $3.50. Yes, thats right. Ticket included. That's everything for only 50 cents more than a box of CANDY costs at theatres. 

Then I walked back to my dorm, avoiding all the drunks who went out for Thirsty Thursdays. I think I saw one getting arrested...
Anyway, it was a good day.


Oh. Jake Berezin, as we just found out, is Jared's cousin. The kid who is friends with Liv at westfield is cousins with my friend Jared at Temple. Weird lol."

Then he told me they're at a place near city hall. I told him I haven't even been off campus since school started. He was shocked and invited me to go to the movies with some people tonight. Sweet.

He then asked for my # to contact me. When I started with 413... he jumped.
""Where are you from!?!""
""Um western mass""
""No. WHERE.""
""Around springfield.""
""Omg I'm from Longmeadow!!"" (Ha. We slaughtered their debate team)
""I'm from Monson!""
He was excited.

"event","Hm yeah so yesterday asian Chris finally contacted me and said people were meeting up for dinner. 
I met up with Chris, Brian, and two guys I didn't know (Jim and Drew) and we ate. Brian then went back to his dorm, and Chris,Jim, Drew, and I chilled listening to music in Drew's dorm before the game. At 8:45 we headed over to 1300 to Chris's dorm room. Brian came down from his dorm room on the 3rd floor to watch with us.

I watched my first non-pats football game. Supposedly I'm going to be an Eagles fan by the end of football season, according to Brian. I think everyone's nuts. Drew, however, is from the Boston so I wasn't alone when I was defending the championship of New England sports. 

There was random dancing, yelling, and laughter throughout the night. It was quite amusing and I found myself cheering for the eagles just because of the excitment in the room... and also because they were behind lol. I usually cheer for the losing team when it's not the Pats playing. 

So we didn't finish the game and shut it off when there was 2 minutes on the clock. Apparently the guys had lost all hope of winning lol. So then the kids in 1300 went to bed and Jim, Drew, and I stayed outside for an hour just talking. I got back after 1am and talked with Tasha. I was hyper and so was she cuz she's from Georgia and the Falcons had won, so she was uber happy. 

I didn't go to bed until 3 am, even though I had an 8:40 class this morning and had to get up at 7:30. Needless to say I'm tired right now lol. I think I'll go to bed or something."

Actually most people here have never heard of it. It makes me sad, and I think they are all deprived. Those who HAVE heard of it think that the idea of putting fluff and peanut butter together on a sandwich is DISGUSTING. Whats wrong with these people? No one's had a Fluffernutter? They think it's gross?? How can they live?<BR>I thought Fluff was necessary for life!</P>
<P>So after lunch we walked around campus talking for about a 1/2 hour, before he had to go to class at 1:20. <BR>We came unto the subject of Risk. He's played it,but thinks there's more luck to it than strategy (leave it to a History major to think so lol). Then he started talking about Risk 2210 A.D.</P>
<P>Risk 2210 A.D.?? Wha?? </P>
<P>Yeah, that's what I thought. </P>
<P>It takes place in the future, complete with a game board for the world... and the moon. You can use naval and lunar/air vessals as well. That's right. Planes. You can attack inland countries that you aren't touching. </P>
<P>It sounds like a pretty decked out version of Risk and if we can find it, we DEFINITELY need to play it.<BR></P>

Tasha was out till 3am and when she came in there was this guy John with her. Dorm building 1300(where he lives.. Brian too I might add) is across campus and no one wanted him to walk alone there that late but yet no one wanted to walk him there...lol. So he came into our dorm building and we put him up for the night. 

We decide that we're not tired and should watch a movie. So we decide to invite Rob (a kid who lives in the same hall as us and is pretty nice actually.. from Alambama. He's in my Spanish class I think lol). So Rob joins us. 

I got my bed, Tasha and John (who apparently has a g/f but doesn't act like it lol) got her bed, and poor Rob took a bunch of pillows and took the floor (it looked very uncomfy, but he assured that he was fine lol). 

So Rob was the first to fall asleep and we're all there watching him turn on what looks like the most uncomfortable sleeping quarters ever, when I said:
""He looks so uncomfortable. Does anyone know why he's even sleeping here? He lives three doors down where he has his OWN bed...""

Well Tasha and John then wondered the same thing lol. 


So we all ended up falling asleep and the boys left around 10 am. Weird night lol."

He asked if I wanted to go to dinner. So he walked to my dorm so we could walk to dinner, and we chatted all the way. He just got a cell phone, so I can now call him! Yay!

We walked around campus for hours talking, seeing as it was a nice night.I just got back, and instead of letting me walk alone, he walked me to the dorm. Apparently he has a rule for me about never walking alone at night, and also to never go into dark allies or talk to suspicious strangers on city stoops lol. I told him I had already walked alone back to my dorm before at night and he's like ""oh, breaking the rules of Brian, eh? It won't happen again!"" hehe.

Made good freinds with my roommate Tasha, and my suitemates Nancy and Tincey. And their friends My and Pennell. Theyre all cool. We watch romance movies all day and chat and go for walks. I'm very happy with the girls I'm rooming with and we're all becoming friends, which is cool. I haven't even seen the orientation crew, however.

I'm leaving today
Living it, leaving it to change

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tounge tied and twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags
Finally on the move

I'm leaving today
I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change

As I'm driving, I'm captured by the view
So much beauty, the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising, and my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collective as a child that lies within

See I'm leaving today
I'm living it, oh I'm leaving it to change
See I'm leaving today
Oh yes, I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change
But somehow I'll miss it
I think I'll really miss it, one day

I turn up the radio
And I'm feeling like Ive never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
I bring, finally free

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze...

I'm leaving today
Oh yes, I'm living it, leaving it to change
See I'm leaving today
I'm living it
Leaving to change
I'm leaving today
Living it, leaving to change

But somehow I'll miss it, 
I think I'll really miss it... 
One day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I'll miss seeing your faces. Good Luck Everyone."

<P>this was his away message: </P>
<P>""You know what I just did? </P>
<P>I went outside, and looked up at the sky, and I saw a ton of stars. They were really pretty. </P>
<P>Then I realized that this would be the last time in a long time that I would be able to see a clear sky of stars. </P>
<P>I knelt down and said a prayer, asking God to watch over things while I'm away and watch over me after I leave. </P>

My last week here. It's surreal, since I won't be coming back as much as all of you.When I say goodbye, it will REALLY mean goodbye. ""Bye, see you this Christmas"". Yesterday I went college shopping, and it started to get me excited. I want to leave, but I know once I do I'm not coming back. 

Mixed feelings, and somehow, I still don't care yet.


I leave Thursday afternoon. Wednesday I babysit from 8:30am-3:30pm. 

I want to go to six flags one last time. I want to go mini golfing. And bowling. I NEED to see Fantastic 4. And 40-year-old Virgin. 
I probably won't get to do any. :-/

I'm also planning a sleepover for maybe Tuesday night? All girls are invited. I just hope no one minds leaving before 8:30 in the morning... that's the only problem. But everyone's invited. Let me know if it's good for everyone. 


So much I want to do, and no time to do it in. Blah."

"event","He called!!!! Last night, while I was out, he called my cell. I was out with Dane so I couldn't talk long, but I was so happy. And he sounded like he was in a good mood as well. 
Why did it take him to call so long you ask? He was at his grandmothers in central Pennsylvania the past week and just got home Sunday night. :-)
He was all excited I called. He said I've been the only one to call him so far out the people he gave his number to. 
So since I didn't get to talk long I asked if he was gonna be home at all today so I could call. So I get to call him today at 7 and talk to him.

Yay!!!!

Well that made my night. And day after the night.. pretty much all day today. lol. I'm like counting down the hours lol.

"event","Well I just wrote a long entry about orientation and then it got deleted. So if u want to know about it, ask me. It was awesome. The first two days were slow, but tuesday and wednesday were a total blast. I met a group of people who don't drink, smoke, and don't do drugs. These kids also love to dance (especially the guys!!) and the guys love to sing. We all started randomly singing. It was great. They reminded me of everyone back home. They were weird and random and tons of fun. 

My fav person I met was Brian. This guy is amazing. His nickname is Spiderman cuz he can pricatically climb anything and can balance himself on one hand. He's so amusing to watch and I spent a lot of time talking to him. Tuesday night I went to his dorm room and he was gonna go to bed, but instead we ended up talking for over an hour, until about 1:30 in the morning. He loves to sing, he's smart, going for a history major, likes to eat peanut butter out of the jar, loves taking pictures, doesn't mind dancing, loves cartoons and comic books (we spent a great deal of time talking about batman and x-man and stuff) and is very open and honest. He's a waiter and has a summer job of being a camp counselor for kids. The next day I spent a lot of time with him as well. He had extra hours before his class scheduling appointment and we just started walking around. I still needed to get my ID taken and he had already done his in the morning. So we're just walking, not knowing where we're going and then we come to this building. He starts to go up the stairs and I was like ""what are you doing?"". He replies with, ""Well you said you needed your ID done, this is where you get it. I figured I could wait while you get it done.."". I dunno, I just thought that was nice. He waited while I got my ID done and it was all his decision. :-)
Then we walked around campus for over an hour talking. He then says ""Oh yeah, I need to fold my linens and give them back to the dorm and then pack"", and I said ""Oh right, so do I"". So he says to me ""Well we'll go to your room first and I'll help you"". ANOTHER nice thing. He started folding my sheet and everything and I was like ""you don't have to do that.."" and he just smiled and said ""yeah.. I know.."". So after we went to his room to do the same thing. I was telling him about how I had been trying to make friends with a lot of people but they would all shun me or would talk to me nicely, but only out of courtesy. His response was ""Who would do that?? You're such a nice and interesting person"". *Sigh* lol
Anyway when I had to leave he gave me a big hug and we exchanged #'s. I'm telling you, this guy was awesome. 

There was also an awesome guy named Jim who serenaded me with Phantom songs and other broadway songs. He has an amazing voice. Brian is really good too. They all started singing together. 

These people were amazing. *Sigh*

I took pics. You can see the campus (and Brian) on this site:

"event","Yeah so during the day today I did basicly nothing lol. At 3:40 I had an optomitrist appointment where they shined nice bright lights in my eyes and then I came home and talked to Gerrin for a bit. After that Shawn called. I have been trying to reach him for the past 4 days. So he finally called and I asked him what was up for next Wednesday (Reel Big Fish concert!!). He said he had no idea. Then he asked,""what are you doing right now?"" I told him ""Nothing"". So he says ""Well I'm just driving around, I'll stop in then"". So he did, and we went online, called Gerrin, and tried to figure out what we should do.
Appartently, ordering them in advance has service charges, and will be expensive. So... we're gonna wing it and order them at the door. Go early and pay $19, instead of like $23 a ticket. 

So after that dilemma was settled, Shawn and I talked for a bit. Then as he was about to leave, it started POURING. He stepped out into the rain and spun around, and made a comment like ""I love the rain!"". He then saw my eyes light up. We ran around and just stood out in it for a bit and then he says ""You got a basketball?"". So the game was on! We shot hoops and then I beat him in a game of HORSE. We then went splashing in puddles. It was a ton of fun!

He thanked me for cheering him up (he's been feeling down lately), gave me big hug, and went home. 

I LOVE THE RAIN!!"

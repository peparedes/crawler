"event","You know how people always tell you to be yourself and you'll go far? Well, maybe you do, maybe you don't, either way i think you'll understand. Anyways, how am i supposed to be myself if I don't know who that is. I think i try too hard to make everyone like me that i just get lost...I must have taken a wrong turn the other day.

I wish i just didn't care, really i do. I tell myself I don't care, i tell others i don't care but I know i do. I hate sharing feelings with people. Hell, i hate sharing things on this journal cuz other people will probably read it and take it the wrong way. Just like what everyone did with the ""angry"" poem i read last friday. I just wish people would quit assuming things.

On a completely different note, today we went on a field trip to naper settlement. I have to admit, they were pretty good actors that worked there but i kinda zoned out after the first couple of words they said. Oh well, what can ya do? I think i shall be going now...goodbye my friends

"event","So here i am, on the computer once again. Today was quite boring. I stayed home from school cuz i wasn't feeling well and i slept most of the day and i watched some tv. Now I'm trying to finish my ""i have a dream"" paper. It's about suicide and how it results in so many deaths yet we are all so unaware. I guess i kind of have writers block, though, because i don't know what to write... Grrrr. I'm listening to switchfoot-we were meant to live. It's a kickass song and theres meaning behind it too. In one part of the song, it says &quot;...maybe were living with our eyes half open..."" That made me think of how i spend so much time worrying about the bad things in life that i barely have time to even recognize the good. I really do take life for granted. I hate it when people say they hate life because if you weren't alive, you wouldn't be experiencing anything at all and to me, that would suck. Today my sisters boyfriend came over unexpecetely. And of course, i was sitting here looking like a slob cuz i was still in my pajamas since i didn't go anywhere today and my hair was all over the place and i had on an ugly green robe from like the 80s. So i ran downstairs while hiding behind my robe :-\. Oh well, its not like he cares. I've been streesed over this whole high school thing lately. I don't feel ready to go. I don't want to grow up because once you're grown up, you have nothing else to look froward to. High school is going to be too big of a responsibilty for me cuz i can barely handle junior high right now. If junior high is supposed to be a preparation for highschool, why do i feel so ill-equipped? Relationships with friends haven't been going too well lately, either. Everyone just seems to be moving on without me. Maybe I'm just stuck in the past...? Who knows. I don't think i'll ever really grow up. Well this is really random, but did u know that within the next 17 minutes another person will take their own life? It's pretty sad. Theres always an alternative, besides death. Sometimes i wonder if it's hard to die. Like i think that if i ever was shot or hurt i would be able to get over it and be fine. Is it hard to pass over to the other side? Wow, that doesn't make too much sense. Im just saying the first thing that comes to mind right now. Hmm, well I think im gonna go try and finish my paper, see ya

"event","It's funny how when they need you, you're standing right there behind them waiting for them to fall so you can catch em'. But when you need them, they leave you there to fall. It's really not fair. I mean, they call themselves your friends and they make all these promises but its all lies. Its like they're living in the moment, not caring whats gonna happen in the future. And these people are just so concerned about their own lives they barely have time to even conisder yours. They take you for granted not knowing that someday, you might not be there for them anymore..."

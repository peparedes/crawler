"event","Yet another explanation for why I have not been on here for so long... Facebook!!! I really needed to return to a site with more anonymynity than that so here I am back again.  I am living with my parents again and tonight my husband has decided that he needs time away from me and left to go to his buddy's house.  We lost Smelly earlier this year to diabetes.  Lucky pooch just had surgery on his knee and ACL.  I am unemployed yet again but think that was a blessing in disguise because part of the reason that we are with my parents again is that my mom's cancer has become re-active.  I never would have been able to help her out and keep up with my family and my job.  Oh, and Jerry filed for disability several years ago so now we have that income to supplement things.  
You ever have one of those days where you feel completely lost... like nobody cares if you are here or if you fade into the background.  I have been taken advantage of and walked all over most of my life and to be honest with myself finally I am so tired of it.  Tired of being someone for everyone else but myself.  There is so much more to me than the people in my everyday life know.  It's frustrating.  I need to be loved and appreciated for that - NOT for what i can do for you or what i can get for you or what i can be for you.  It really pisses me off that my own family finds me inadequate, lazy, and overweight.  I expected that marriage would be that kind of equal support system where you never hear that kind of stuff... where your partner holds you up when you are down and out - not kicks you in the ass crack.  I know i am not a perfect person... i will be the FIRST one to tell you that. BUT i do expect the one who says they love me to NEVER tell me that i'm not... i believe that love is unconditional and part of that is always reminding those you love that they are beautiful and wonderful and important and valuable - no matter how menial their job may be, no matter if they have a job or not, no matter what your personal agenda is for the day.  but i'm babbling here.
thanks for listening to today's rant.  if life keeps going in this direction, i am sure there will be more to come. =)"

"event","OK, so I have been neglecting my LiveJournal because I got sucked into MySpace.  Brief update:  now my docs think that the bipolar diagnosis was incorrect and that I am just battling a very medication-resistant depression.  Had my medication changed too much to count and still no better.  I lost my job last July and have only had brief stints at jobs since then, so that pretty much sucks.  Same for my husband, too, since he was let go last February.  Our house is being foreclosed upon in August.  Pretty much the only good thing in life is our daughter.  
I have been making jewelry like a fiend, though.  A friend of mine has taken some and will be posting it on his website soon so hopefully I can make a few bucks.  
Looking forward to this year's Ren Faire at Sterling Forest in NY.  I cannot wait.
Hope everyone has been doing well on here and sorry for my long absence, I will be more attentive in the future!
Love lots, Me."

"event","i didn't realize that it has been over a month since i have last posted here.  so much has happened.  i had to stop taking my medication for BP because since i lost my job i can't afford it.  my daughter started school and so did my sister (she's up in boston and i miss her crazy and hilariousness mucho).  my husband finally got a job, he starts next thursday (he has been out of work since february).  i'm still jobless and waiting for the disability insurer to make a decision on my claim. 
like most people with BP, i have periods of depression mixed with periods of high euphoria/energy.  when i am depressed, i don't want to do crap and when i'm energetic i can't decide what to do first SO i largely end up doing nothing
i went to the NY Ren Faire last week.  OMG that was soooo much fun!  I was able to refill some of my oils and incense as well as find some new fragrances that suited my recent moods.  i also found a really cool anklet that tinkles nicely when i walk and it was only ten bucks i was so stoked to find it.  i wanted to get a reading there from a psychic, but i was with my husband;s entire immediate family who are very straight-edge.   never thought they would even approve of foing to a ren faire, but hey, they seemed to have a good time.  ran into some old friends and that was cool but think hubby may have gotten a bit jealous b/c they were both guys.  that was kind of silly of him.
i am thinking about adding to my ever-growing list of projects trying my hand at making wings.  it sounds like fun and i could use some fun in my life right now."

"event","getting tons and tons of ideas for crafting, but not enough cash flow to follow thru on them.  it's a bit depressing.  scrapbooking an album for my see-sta who will be going away and leaving us for college soon, and i must say that it is coming along fab-u-lously!  i am so proud of myself.  also went back to jewelrymaking with more of a purpose than before, but my attention span is not doing so well.  i can only manage about an hour or so at a time.  something to talk to my therapist about i guess.  also have been doing some poetry...

sometimes i write inspired
caught using my vision...
but then - gotta think different
thrown away those future dreams
change the distortion
learn my life is being lived
a friend made me see
she suceeds in bringing me back

its a bit choppy, but that seems to be the way that everything is coming out lately.  my battle with bipolar has finally lost me my job.  this was a big blow to me here.  i was basically given no choice in this, it was either leave or be asked to leave, so i went with grace.  argh.  i hate it when 'the man' wins.  
looking forward to the sterling ren faire in NY this year.  thinking about making a new costume and some wings."

"event","my ebay green leaf jewelry set sold today, that was awesome.  i'm making a scrapbook for my sister, who is big into 'gangsta' rap, it's covered with rhinestone ""bling"".  when i'm finished I'll post a photo.  i just finished some party invites for my mother in law, they came out pretty good, i was impressed b/c i thought they were going to come out like crap!  also updated my resume and sent that out to a new place, so that should be cool.

been thinking a lot about an ex lately.  occupying dreams and such, very strange. so get this, i found his phone number today and called it.  heart thumping like mad, felt all queasy and such.  ended up that it was not even his phone anymore.  but on the otherhand, i should try to contact him b/c i think his mom is dying.  this could be why he has been in my mind so much.  but just the way i have felt when thinking about him makes me feel weird.

therapy is going well and so is life in general.  i've been forgetting to take meds, which has not had the adverse affects on me that i thought it would.  not sure if i should keep going or stop.  i feel like i'm on rants here like a madwoman.

need to go grab some more crafting supplies.  later"

(lucky faerie you!) i am saving for preservation of sanity!  ha ha.  not sure if that is even possible any more.

my sister (ahem) copped out on me this past weekend and missed a perfectly rocking time in massachusetts!  she needs to start boning up on her partying skills if she plans on making any headway in college this fall.  can't go there with zero tolerance b/c she will just end up hungover and pissy everyday!  from what i read in journal, nothing more exciting went on in her life this weekend, but we will catch her un on everything this weekend when i throw her grad party!  hee hee - get ready for a good time...

also, seems like falling out with everyone lately.  tried to have mom in law and sis in law over this afternoon and niether called to tell me yes or no at all.  harumph.  hubby and i had HUGE blowout today.  we both have violent tempers.  sometimes i think i should be VIOLENT butterfly.  getting lost in my creativity is my escape lately, but that seems to be portrayed as a negative.  i do not think that hubby feels that the creativity is condusive to any kind of progress, however it is quite the contrary.  since the accident last year, i hadn't had much desire or abaility to be creative at all and now that it is coming back to me, i see that as a big change and a big positive.  that certainly doesn't mean that all is coming back to me.  still lacking concentration, focus and memory ability, but i have been writing a lot of my ideas down and clipping inspirations from magazines and such.  

i'm tired but wish i could rant more.  find that once i get going, it is easier to keep going, but too tired right now."

ok, new meds seem to be working out okay.  happy about that, but mood swings are still pretty bad.  find myself yelling a lot.  i guess that's to be worked through.  looking for a new job because this one is going south fast.

anyhoo, update on my last entries' to-do list:

-sent out the baby onesie to my expectant friend;

"event","i have so many thoughts and ideas running through my head right now that it is hard for me to concentrate on just one.  here's a tip of my list:
- finish the crochet poncho that i am making for my daughter
- design some new jewelry to sell at upcoming fairs
- finish the pillow that i designed for my mother in law
- mail some returns out so i can get some cash back
- mail out gifts i have made - esp the one for my friend who is expecting in October! (hoping for a halloween baby!)
- organize my closet (finally) from winter to summer clothes
- need a hair cut
- give hubby hair cut

lots of other stuff still swirling that is not ready to come out yet.  that's the part that aggravates me the most - not being able to get it all out.  i can deal with a list of things on paper, just not in my head.  also, that title for today means that yeah, i've got stuff to keep me busy, it's lack of motivation and not being able to focus on one thing at a time.  newpshych said today that the newmeds should help with that, it's a wait and see.

also trying to decide if i should keep this job or move on to another.  i keep hearing ""follow your heart"" - well right now my heart is silent but my mind is a mile a minute.  does that mean that i should wait until i can hear my heart?  harumph, all is complex in my little corner of this universe."

"event","Feeling good the past few days b/c finally been able to sleep at least a solid 6 hours a night.  This is an accomplishment since I really have not been able to do this since reducing my S. pill to 25mg.  Now that the S. pill is out of the picture and has been replaced by the A. pill, things have been much clearer in my head.  I didn't think that it would have happened so fast.  I've had much more energy and the ideas have been flowing - a GREAT thing for me.  That means a bit of me is finally coming back.  However, the motiviation is still catching up :/ beggars cannot be choosers!  
So the Buffet concert rocked on Friday night!  THought I would be bummed because I had like NO sleep the night before (first night on A. pill) but I was actually alert and enjoying.  Best part was the audience singing ""Why Don't We Get Drunk And Screw"".  I have never seen that many hawaiian shirts in one place before.  It was a sea of chaos and revelry.  Totally cool.  Jimmy is such a good artist and he really makes an effort to get the audience to feel at home and comfortable.  Although the seats we had were behind the stage, I was happy to find that they were pretty good seats after all.  Got home at 2am though, that kind of sucked.  Also decided that we were not going to gamble as previously thought.  That was probably a good decision since we tend to not have the best of luck.
Saturday was a bit of a blur.  Had to run errands, go to mom in laws Pampered Chef party which went well.  Then celebrated Father's Day with my father in law.  Got home late, but nothing planned today so it was all good.  Today slept in and then made breakfast for hubby.  Went to see my dad before he went off to spend a week in Vermont at his new vacation home.  Had lunch with Mom.  It was nice.  Came home and mowed the lawn *harumph*.  
Overall it was a good weekend.  Got another nasty letter from work but that's ok, I may resign anyway.  I'm trying not to let them get to me.  My youngest younger sister graduates high school next Saturday before she is off to Boston University in the fall.  I'll miss her so much, she is the greatest!

Anyhoo, should go off to bed now since I have to go to work tomorrow. *yuk*

"event","I'm bipolar! A-HA!  Finally someone puts a big old finger on the problem - or is that a big ole dagger in my back, sometimes I can't tell the difference!  After all these months seeing that stupid crotchety old bag of a psychiatrist who played yo-yo with my medications and never heard a damn word I said, i have a one hour session with a new psych and - lo and behold - i leave with a diagnosis.  And not just a ""let's give it a name so you shut up"" diagnosis.  An honest-to-godness easy to understand explanation of why and what has been happening with me.  Why I would be struck to clean out my closet at 1am - iron everything in it and put it back arranged by type and color.  Or Why I just cannot stand to have a box of crayons not be in color order.  Or why sometimes i put things off if i know that i won't be able to finish them befor the end of the day (because i cannot stay up until 2am to finish it or my husband will kill me).  FINALLY something that has a goal attached to it.. "" you are taking this med because it's going to do this"" not ""let's see if this makes you feel any less anxious"" or ""let's see if this will make you less depressed"".  
New psych also made meds changes.  Finally going to be off the one that sedates me so bad that I hallucinate.  Also going to be off the one that steals my libido and gives me those bad headaches.  He says that I will feel more alert - like no more cobweb-brains - hallelujah! Downside being that it will affect my sleep patterns (negatively) for a while until they all work their magic.  I can deal with that for now as long as i can feel dust-free. O to feel like myself again - i wonder if i remember what that's like?
I checked out shyfayrie's webpages and was extremely impressed.  not only is she talented beyond belief, but you can feel her warmth and spirit through the images she creates (not only those drawn by her hand, but also the photos of herself).  Luna, when you read this you really need to check her stuff out.  I'm almost inspired to pop my own stuff on here. I'd dress my daughter up though to use as a model because she is way more beautiful than me!  And she just looks so darn cute in her faerie wings.  A word on that - hope we get to go to the ren faire this year, I missed it so much last year!  
Really hoping that the new meds clear out my jumbled mess of a brain.  I've had so much time on my hands to look at what others are doing with their talents and I feel like I am just wasting mine.  But that lack of motivation and confidence will do that to you...
need to retire for the evening, but tomorrow brings another day"

"event","K... never got back to the journal last night, headache was just killing me.  Much as it is right now, I've got to get a bunch of crap off my chest. Pls excuse any mispellings or grammar mistakes as my brain usually goes faster than my fingers.
What am I really worth here?  my husband thinks hes doing me good, but his vision of me just isn't me anymore.  i'm used to being on task - able to perform anything faster and more efficiently and with higher quality than anoyone else around me.  no offense intended, that's just me.  i dont care to compare anyone's abilities to mine, in fact, i hate competition.  my performance lately in any task - work or home - has been shoddy at best.  everything takes longer and never comes out right.  i've probably ruined our credit by letting the bills lag.  I let the homeowner's insurance lapse inadvertently and had to have it reinstated.  i'll probably lose my job because i'm literally MAKING them get fed up with me.  my headaches are so bad at times that i am exremely crabby to everyone.  i cave to everyone except my husband. at first sign of confrontation i fall into a jumbled mess of emotions and tears - no backbone left.
i've got tons of things to work on that would bring me pleasure, but lack the motivation to do any of them, if i even get as far as to begin, it takes too long to finish.  when i do finish i find fault in all i've done. this stitch is too loose, this flower is not set just right, this paragraph should be different, i can find a better way to organize that... etc etc and so on. then i've gone and shot down the little confidence that i had.
 i have no idea what career path to move towards and truthfully, right now what employer would want me?  i doubt that i would present well in an interview at all.  i don't even really care what anyone else thinks (except maybe my husband) of me anyway, it's just my own thoughts of myself that scare me.
i have no idea of even where to begin to get a better hold on myself. at one point while going through therapy i thought i was getting somewhere. then out of the blue here i am a mess again. no self-confidence, no sense of self-worth, no desire to do anything, no idea where to begin to change.  everything looms above or ahead of me. there is so much that i want or need to do - but to even start it, compartmentalize it - takes everything i have.  i've tried to take it one step at a time. am i afraid od failing, afraid of messing things up, afraid of not meeting my own standards, afraid of finding that i just can't do anything as well as i used to.
Whatever is happening to me is worrying me beyond belief. i think that i'm - now or have been - putting on a brave face and telling myself that i'll get through this but each time i think i see the light at the end - it moves farter away from me.  maybe it was never there to begin with, maybe i've been imagining it, maybe i've been wanting to get there so badly that i forced myself to think it's there.  have i been telling everyone what they want to hear or have i been lying to myself? i don't know what is real or make believe (in my subconcious?)
i wake up sometimes and think my dreams are/were real. i've always had vivid dreams but have always been able to distinguish the difference.  now i'm not so sure.  i get way more deja vu than ususal.  this scares me. beyond belief it scares me. so much that it bothers me throughout the day. so now what? - i can't manage my dreams, my own thoughts, on top of my weight, my job, my marriage, my family, my bills/money, my mood, my motiviation??? what ELSE???
Should i give up and commit myself? woudl it be better if i removed myself for a while from everyone so that i stop being such a burden - a wrench in the works?  what;s the point of waking up in the morning  - i can't sleep anyway - just to get up so I can again have nothing accomplished at the end of the day anyway? this is so frustrating. and writing this all down does a few things for me right now:  1) makes moe more angry with myself  2)makes me think of more reasons why i'm useless 3) wonder why i can never remember to bring any of this up in therapy or with my psychiatrist?  My pride doesn't even help me out anymore because i'm thinking - pride in what???, myself???, what's there to have pride in? - pretty much just the fact that I produced a wonderfully smart and beautiful spirited daughter and that I have found a husband who for the most part had put up will all my junk!
Everyone thinks it should be so easy by now to get through this - that enough time has gone by now - and why am i not better yet?  why are we paying for all this therapy and meds when you are ""supposedly"" still so f-ed up?!?  I DON'T KNOW!! I JUST AM, OK?!?  Everything about me stinks, i'm a 27 year old loser. Lazy, unsless, lacking intelligence, lacking the drive to ""staighten up"" for my family and finances, common sense lost, confidence shot, all i touch i turn to sh*t.  And the worst part is that I'm beginning to think that I'm going to end up destroying myself unintentionally with all this.

Now I know that there are people in this world that are WAY worse off than me.  Beleive me I have way more respect for them than anyone will ever know.  Anyone who can live each day as a blessing in the face of iminent crisis or even death is a Saint to me.  Just makes me feel like worse of a person.  I think if this was cancer (heaven forbid) i'd have an easier time of it because it is tangible.  Mental illness is an intangible thing, you can't prove it to those who cannot see it, you cannot explain it so that they ""get-it"".  Moderate mental illness is worse because the signs (to me anyway) are so minute, so slight, that often they are attributed to physical maladies that will ""go away"" in time otherwise they are ""faked"" or ""embellished"" into the person's favor.  Makes it harder for the affected person.  I give those people who can overcome all health problems and mental challenges all my UTMOST RESPECT and COMPASSION.  Those people are true heroes, true survivors - living each day sometimes as if it were their last and being thankful for each one.

"event","GOD! It's hot in here.  The rest of the house had A/C 'cept my office... figures.  Need to call back my BFF J.  Keep forgetting, not that it's anything new!  Seems like I forget everything lately.  BTW, my bathroom remodel is finally getting somewhere, tub was installed today, tile is picked out and pipes have been run for the sink.  Tomorrow should have wiring for the electrical and the fan installed.  By Thursday it will be ready for sheetrock!  Only how many months now?? 
Didn't go to work today, not because of the crazy thing, but because of the remodel.  Still trying to finish my budget, better get it done before hubby finds out.  OK, went ahead and called J.  On the phone now, not sure if I can multitask.  I may need to come back to the journal.
Ok, yeah, need to come back to the journal.

"event","Almost midnight and I am supposed to be doing my family budget.  As usual I got sidetracked checking e-mail, which always ends up in following a ton of junk e-mail links to pages I woudl not usually bother with.  My therapist said that keeping a journal would help me remember activities and get me accustomed again to a routine.  Since a paper journal could possibly be found by family members, an online journal was the best choice for me. Besides, it may help me with the hand-eye coordination that I have been lacking as of late.  Brief history of current condition (similar to my neuropshychology evaluation:
I've always had stressors in my life and managed to push them back far enough to not be troubled (much) by them.  I'm much more the giver of advice than the taker of my own.  I'd give anything to anyone just to see them happy.  Last year, there was a series of events that ended up suffocating me and my spirit.  My parents separated after 25 years of marriage and 4 kids, i lost my lease, I had to find and close on a home within 30 days, my job got increasingly ridiculous, my daughter came down with pneumonia followed immediately by mononucleosis, i moved twice, i was involved in a car accident in which i hit another car and then hit a house (no-one was injured, hallelujah), my job performance diminished, i can't remember the last time i slept through the night unassisted by medication or alcohol, i had an emotional/mental breakdown, went on disability from my job, and then my husband lost his.  Gee, is that all?  I think so.

Ok, so life is not all that bad, in fact, I know it could be worse.  We all made it through, and although I am struggling, there are so many people going through worse times than me.  Losing parents, children and loved ones in Iraq, parents of missing or victimized children, people with incurable disease... I have the deepest sense of respect for those people dealing with these and all tradgedies.  But in a sense, we all think that we are the center of our own universe, and unless all is right within our bubble, then the world does not seem all that rosy.   I don't care who you are or what you do, at one point in everyone's life we have been unhappy and fed up with it all.  We wish we had more money, more time to spend with our families, more ""things"", better sex, better educations, better jobs, no job at all, etc.  These are all things we take for granted, yet these are all things that someone other than us is having, and we want it.  That is what humans do... WANT.  It is the foundation of life.  If people did not WANT what they don't NEED, life would be so much easier.  We are all guilty of that.
Got on my soap box, sorry, I hate that.  Tangents are everywhere.
So what is with my subtitle, ""Flying in V Formation""?  Funny you should ask.  If you need to ask, then you don't need to get it.  You may not be on the same page as me, however, I don't fault you for it.
Back to what I am doing now... waiting for my husband to come in and ask me when we are going to bed and am I done with the budget yet?  No dear, I am not, nor will I be for several days.  This is taking a lot out of me.  besides the fact that i am feeling less intelligent than usual!
Signing off for now, before the H finds me online again!
V9B, A"

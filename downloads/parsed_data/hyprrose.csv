"event","i'm so bad at staying close to people who are far away
i think it's because i can't judge what's important and interesting in my life
there just never seems to be anything interesting to tell
and i'm not funny
so, it's hard
and i know in my head that i need to talk to people
so we'll stay close
and friends
and not drift like crazy
but
i always just feel like, the next time i see this person we'll talk it all out
it'll be good
i'll be happy
but i never see anybody so that reasoning is silly
and insane
but
it's what's in my head

people have been contacting me lately
it's nice to hear from them
but i want them here physically
i want a diary of their lives
i want to know what they do with their time
i want to know their friends and lovers and hobbies and obsessions

i want to make art
i want to create and discover and blow people's fucking minds
i want to be able to express things
because i suck at speech
and writing
so shouldn't there be something that i'm good at to express myself?
my ideas?
i want to MAKE, but i don't know what i want to make, or how, or why
i just want to make

i wish i was talented
or motivated
or dedicated
or any of those things

i should go bake or something
that's what natalie said to do when you're feeling in a create mood
but i don't think it works so well
cause i'm not TALENTED and i want things to be AWESOME
so everything i do comes out shitty when the things in my head are mind-blowing
at least
they would be
if they were made

sigh
i'm feeling unfulfilled at the moment
this is what happens when you are in constant contact with someone who pushes any negative thoughts in your head away
you forget you have any faults

"event","i am pretty sure that i've never lost control and cried in school before today.
i feel ridiculous that i'm sobbing over this. i feel terribly self-centered and childish when i sob over this.
but i don't cry over anything theatre does to me
nothing. not anything ms. g said to me, or did, or caused
i fucking bit my lip and took it and did whatever i could to do the best i could
and i just
i had all this hope
i had all this excitement and i'm just so disappointed
and that's all this year's been
it's been one soul-crushing event after another
i've worked so fucking hard all the time, and i DO everything, everything, and i still never reap any rewards 
i feel like i'm whining, which is why this is on livejournal and not xanga or facebook or myspace
cause no one really reads this
and i hate whining
but it hurts
it just really really hurts
and i'm sobbing and i don't understand
i know this isn't a life-altering event or anything
but it's just added on to all of the shit that's happened that ""isn't a life-altering event""
i am just so tired of being in the group that gets fucked over
there's just no more hope
and yet i'm not smart enough to consider dropping
i'm not
cause i just can't
people are depending on me being in the troupe
and i'm one of the few who can keep my fucking mouth shut when it needs to be and open when it doesn't
i think clearly and that is a rare trait
but there is just nothing left anymore
maybe next year will be better
but i'm so fucking terrified to put anymore hope into this fucking system 
i'm so tired
i'm just so tired of this
i don't want to be hurt over this bullshit
that's so lame
i'm not this lame
i really really am not
but i can't help it
it's just blow after blow, with just enough space in between to get all your hopes up so you drop from&nbsp; a much higher vantage point than before
i hate this
i hate this so much
i wish i could just quit
i wish i had that in me
but i can't
fuck
it hurts so much
and i'm so dissapointed
it's ridiculous
i can't get over this
i can't deal
i say that but i'm gonna go right back there and do my fucking best, like i always do, without a fucking mention that i just fucking sobbed my eyes out over this
i'm such a fucking pansy"

"event","This was a book I had to read for school. While I started Slaughterhouse Five first, I read Interpreter of Maladies first. This is because I am in love with Slaughterhouse Five's style of writing and feel it should be done in a big chunk, not separated by miles and weeks of TIPlove, because every year i'm a different person when i come home, and i want to read it all as this person. But anyway, IoM is a collection of short stories. There are nine. The first 8 are sad. They are really, really unbearably hopeless and depressing, and sometimes I don't think they're supposed to be. Sometimes I think I'm the only one getting that from them. But anyway, to me they are the terribly depressing. And then I read the ninth story today. And suddenly as the book ended I'm sobbing. It was a relatively happy ending, nothing too great, nothing to spectacularly wonderful, just a peaceful ending and suddenly i'm sobbing. I don't understand, Reading those last words made me shake and cry and I want to know why..."

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is medium.
In general, you prefer to have only one love interest.
But it's hard for you to stay devoted for too long!
There's too much eye candy to keep you from wandering.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is low.
You've probably either had only one relationship..
Or all of your relationships have been very similar.
You still have a lot to learn... and a lot to try!

Dominance:

Your dominance is low.
This doesn't mean you're a doormat, just balanced.
You know a relationship is not about getting your way.
And you love to give your sweetie a lot of freedom.

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is high.
Sure you believe in love, but you know it doesn't come easily.
You scoff at ""love at first site"" and ""soumates.""
You rather take the real thing, as unglamorous as it is.

Independence:

Your independence is high.
You don't need to be in love, and sometimes you don't even want love.
Having your own life is very important for you...
Even more important than having a relationship.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div>"

 you know what i mean? uh huh
above
in the clouds
high up
...no not that type
just
like im out of perspective 
or floating
whatever
sunsets
are beautiful
i miss the sunrises, whether its because i'm up too early or too late
they are so fleeting
beginings are always the quickest to leave
endings last for so long whether they gave us warning or not

You are both logical and creative. You are full of ideas.
You are so rational that you analyze everything. This drives people a little crazy!

Intelligence is important to you. You always like to be around smart people.
In fact, you're often a little short with people who don't impress you mentally.

You seem distant to some - but it's usually because you're deep in thought.
Those who understand you best are fellow Rationals.

In love, you tend to approach things with logic. You seek a compatible mate - who is also very intelligent.

At work, you tend to gravitate toward idea building careers - like programming, medicine, or academia.

With others, you are very honest and direct. People often can't take your criticism well.

As far as your looks go, you're coasting on what you were born with. You think fashion is silly.

On weekends, you spend most of your time thinking, experimenting with new ideas, or learning new things.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/threequestionpersonalitytest/"">The Three Question Personality Test</a></div>"

Yeah, it's not so definite anymore...

Ok, basically there are people who have been on those roads for 10 hours and they've gone 6-7 miles, and i'm completely serious

My mom does not want to get on those roads and then be stuck there. Cause really, that could cause a lot of deaths if the hurricane hits and they're are millions of people on these roads in a car. Also, everyone's basically out there with no air conditioning because everyone needs to save on gas as the gas stations have been running out and there are huge lines at the ones who aren't runnin out. So there are a bunch of people passing out from dehydration, and basically it's just a huge mess

Also the hurricane is now going more east, making us on the clean and not dirty side. Though really now, it's kind of stalling so we don't know where exactly its going to go. So maddie seems to be in much less danger right now, and hey, she probably is going to end up staying down here! That's not for sure, but i know i will be at least at home till one o clock today, so anyone who has eastern time and gets out at like 2, you guys might be able to talk to me even if i do end up evacuating! 

That's really all i have to say...

just remember i love all of yall, and if you can't get in touch with me, try cullen

Now i think Maria might be reading this, if so, hello Maria. I am posting here some bare information because i don't think you read my xanga. Cullen, you might already know this, but i am definitely evacuating to somewhere near Dallas, way out of the range of the bad bad storm. The storm is a Cat 5 at the moment, and has recently moved onto an even closer path to me and my city. We are going up to stay with my Aunt Carol. We will also hopefully visit my sister Caitlin, and maybe spend some time with my bestest friend Justin, who is evacuating to a hotel in Dallas. i will be here tomorrow morning, but after that i will be on the road for a long time as the roads are all way backed up with people trying to evacuate. So a 5 hr car trip will turn into something like 15. I will definitely not have internet during that, so don't expect to talk to me tomorrow. If by some miracle i have internet up there, i WILL get on. But i am not counting on that to be a true fact. I hope everyone knows that i love them like crazy."

But my dad is kinda crazy and realy really optimistic (which is why we don't have any wood to board up the windows...) so we might just get stuck here....

"event","I dunno if today was really a bad day.  It started out awesome.  Out on the ocean lost in fun and fantacy of what things would be like.  Only to get home and have to accept reality.  It sucked.  I didnt mind work so much other then the busyness and all of everything but like ick.  Hero told me some deep shit and i dont know how to respond.  I dont wanna fight, i just cry, i dont want to deal with it, i just want to move on.  He never wants to talk, why now.  cause were beyond that, damn deep relationships i tell you too much pain.    you always get hurt and its just not fun.  i really dont wanna loose him guys.  and to most of you your all what the fuck are you talking about?  but thats ok im just scared and frantic and i dunno nuts?  yes nuts.  im nuts.  there you go end of story"

"event","At times that boy makes me so depressed cause his words cut so deep but i know what hes capable of and i know its not real.  He knows it too.  He knows he just scared and he thinks he can break me down.  He's not, cause I know.  Im not weak.  Not anymore, thanks to him, he made me strong.  I also know him too well to fall for that shit.  
Hero told me about the dreams and the talking and yelling in his sleep.  I believe that.  Cause thats him.  I wake up the same way, minus the person next to me and slapping me and all....  I dont have that.  But I have the same feelings.  
I never thought it was possible to be able to feel someone else within yourself.  But I've known, for some time now, that is is.  And it's the best feeling at times, and the worst others.  When you can feel someones pain, thats the worst.  But when u can feel their happiness, their love, their longing, all for you, you feel like your going to explode and its the best feeling in the whole world.  We have that.  We can have that.  I still have that.  I always want that."

"event","This is my first day of doing this.  Marianne got me into it.  I thought it would be a good way to ya know, get my feelings out and then Justin could read them.  Or marianne if she cares and all, which personally i dont think she's that bored.  Its so much easier to type then write ya know even though i got new pens.  I got one that smells like apple.  It is really cool.
I just went to the kitchen and rick was standing there talking to himself, hes all i dont know i dont know what am i doing i dont know what im getting where is it?  it was funny but kinda weird.  I have to wear clothes but he can walk around without a shirt on.  I dont get it.  
Today I worked.  It was boring.  Lots of returns.  Sears isn't the funnest place to work, but then again theres hardware.  Marianne knows what that means."

"event","laura got me thinking about love and stuff and how much it really suck. and usually im a pretty happy person and im usually smiling all the time so after reading the thing i found myself not smiling as much and think more about how things could have been and all the what if's of the past.and this to be frank really sucks. it sucks major ass to think that the one you loved got away and will never come back. but  on the other hand im only 14 and life is too short to feel bad and lonely.  well ill be away from enopo again for 3 days with nina on the jersey shore and im starting to enjoy being away from home away from this house, my room my mom"

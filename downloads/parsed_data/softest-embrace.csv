You bring back the inner child in everyone you meet with your sincere and spontaneous ways.
Your childlike (but not childish) behavior also inspires others to care for you.
As a result, those who you befriend and date tend to be incredibly loyal to you.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatkindofseducerareyouquiz/"">What Kind of Seducer Are You?</a></div>

"event","[Meeko12] How old are you anyways? You make me sound like a kid.
[Meeko12] xD
(16:13) [Androoh] 24.
[Meeko12] Ah. o.o
(16:13) [Androoh] Old enough to know better. 
(16:13) [Androoh] I apologise for that.
[Meeko12] Hmm
(16:13) [Androoh] Making you feel like a child that is.
[Meeko12] Oh, it's okay.
[Meeko12] It would have not been if you said you were the same age as me. 
[Meeko12] xD
(16:14) [Androoh] You're... wait. I'm taking a guess here...
(16:14) [Androoh] 19
[Meeko12] 18
(16:14) [Androoh] Ahhh, so close.
[Meeko12] 19 in December.
[Meeko12] So really good guess.
[Meeko12] :P
[Meeko12] Lemme know if I'm bugging you...Sorry, I just find it a little comforting to talk to people in pm sometimes. Because...a lot of people seem a lot different in pm. ^^
(16:16) [Androoh] Yeah, you're bugging me. LEAVE NOW! BEFORE THE VOICES COME BACKKKKK...
[Meeko12] ;-;
(16:17) [Androoh] Nahh, you're not. You're cool, stay and chat by all means.
[Meeko12] Oic.
[Meeko12] ^^
(16:17) [Androoh] You seem like an entertaining person. You make the effort in the chat.
[Meeko12] I'm more entertaining in real life. I feel like a phony in chat because I can say whatever I want whenever I want. And...Nobody cares or anything. But I don't have the guts to say a lot of that in real life. ^^;;
(16:18) [Androoh] And why is that? 
[Meeko12] I dunno. 
(16:19) [Androoh] I'm intrigued to hear why, if you don't mind sharing.
[Meeko12] But I think it's funner when you slowly get to know somebody, as apposed to hearing everything they always want to say. It's a bit more challenging to have to say that when the person is sitting in front of you.
[Meeko12] And I feel like a phony because I can easily make people laugh by watching them make their own jokes. 
(16:20) [Androoh] Well, I guess from my perspective - I'm similar, but at the same time I stay true to my ideals. I stay quiet and reserved around people because perhaps I care what people say... only to a small extent. That's natural though... But at the same time, I don't say much because I have nothing to prove to anyone.
[Meeko12] I don't have anything to prove either...But for some reason I keep trying. ^^;;
(16:21) [Androoh] That only suggests you want their approval though Meeko.
(16:21) [Androoh] Or not so much that, but... Bear with me.
[Meeko12] Maybe I do. 
(16:22) [Androoh] You like people more than you think.
[Meeko12] There is something I want...But...I don't know what it is.
[Meeko12] But isn't there something everybody wants?
[Meeko12] I'm not selfish, but I just want to settle
(16:23) [Androoh] In what respect, settle how? *Beard stroking, Cigar puffing, Analyst mode*
[Meeko12] I don't know. But I feel like I've always been looking for something. Even when I feel like I'm not looking for it, I keep looking subconciously. And even though I look happy all the time, I'm not. I'm still searching and it's taking the life out of me. It's making me...hurt inside and stress all the time. 
(16:27) [Androoh] Ahhh... Very interesting. Hrmm, acceptance of yourself? Approval from others? Social, Spiritual, Sexual fulfient? The meaning of life... Something more abstract?
[Meeko12] Maybe one of those, maybe all of those. I don't know. ^^
[Meeko12] When I find it, I'll write a book.
(16:30) [Androoh] Welcome to the human condition. We've forgotten that we're animals at the core. I think we all spend too much time thinking there is something deeper behind the situation... Too bad we're all consumers with a lot of free time on our hands. But yeah, I think I'd write a book when I've managed to revert back to a more animalistic state... I feel removed from the people equation, yet cognizant of the fact that I am one and I'm wasting my time online. Or something... A random little thought here...
[Meeko12] Is it a waste? Maybe some people think that it's a waste of time. But just like this, talking to people who are more inteligent or have more experience in life...and hearing how they feel about my ideas and thoughts. I think that gives me a little bit more to live by when I do decide to leave the computer. It means so much to me..
(16:35) [Androoh] It is important to discuss things yes - assuming you do  infact use it as a stepping stone which you seem to be suggesting, however I think it's a waste over analysing certain things too much. I'm guilty of this and I can only think 'what if' about somethings a lot. My life so far has been pretty bland - not bad, but not what I'd like and the problem is that I over rationalise things and try to see the structure of everything too intensely instead of just...accepting things.
[Meeko12] I knew somebody like that. ^^ He was worse, actually. 
[Meeko12] It was so bad, I think he took the enjoyment out of actually living his life, and chose to analyze it instead.
(16:37) [Androoh] There you go then. =)
(16:37) [Androoh] Now you don't strike me as that type.
(16:38) [Androoh] You're capable at least of formulating human relationships. Rejoice at that fact and soon the emo-ness will wash away.
[Meeko12] But...I can't see you having that much of a problem. It's okay to question things here and there...Everybody does it once in a while. Some moreso than others. You don't seem like the person who would sit there and think about something before doing it. :P But...Maybe subconciously you do. I don't know.
[Meeko12] And you can't formulate a human relationship? I find that slightly hard to believe. ^^;;
[Meeko12] Maybe you're having trouble finding the right person...Maybe...You're thinking too much before actually doing something with the opposite sex...We all do.
(16:39) [Androoh] Ahh it's true. I can make friends with people, but nothing more personal that requires letting oneself open up... 
(16:39) [Androoh] Not that I'm angsting about it! I'm dealing with it.
[Meeko12] You're allowed to angst-If that is what you want to do. 
[Meeko12] ^^
(16:40) [Androoh] And nahhh. I don't believe that other people and finding the right person is necessarily the solution in these type of situations. =)
[Meeko12] Maybe not.
(16:40) [Androoh] Well you prove my point admirably.
[Meeko12] I'm surprised I have the capability to do such a thing.
(16:41) [Androoh] I think it would be a task to remove ones self from the human experience altogether.
[Meeko12] I can barely figure out what my point is.
(16:42) [Androoh] You just feel out of place and you don't know why.
(16:42) [Androoh] Right?
(16:42) [Androoh] I relate.
[Meeko12] I am out of place, but only because I put myself there on purpose.
[Meeko12] And I know that now, because I'm paying attention to my arrogence. 
(16:43) [Androoh] In what sense do you -know- you're out of place and why the self imposed alienation?
[Meeko12] ^^;;
[Meeko12] For example.
(16:43) [Androoh] That's not arrogant.
(16:43) [Androoh] In my view.
(16:43) [Androoh] But go on...
[Meeko12] I ignore my irl friends because I'm afraid to socialize and care for people. So I tell my parents if anybody calls or comes here, that I'm always busy.
[Meeko12] Or.
[Meeko12] If somebody has a party, I play sick.
[Meeko12] And I do it on purpose.
(16:44) [Androoh] You sound like a female version of myself.
[Meeko12] ^^;;
[Meeko12] It hurts so much...Sometimes.
[Meeko12] But sometimes I think, wow...Look at all the fun they had. Why don't I go next time? And the next time I'm like...I'm not ready yet...And I hold it off.
(16:47) [Androoh] For your sake, try to loosen up sooner rather than later. Be honest to yourself as well, what's holding you back from having fun? 
[Meeko12] My heart.
(16:48) [Androoh] Emotionally holding you back... Physically holding you back?
[Meeko12] It's telling me ""These people won't be here forever, so why love them and care for them now? They will leave you...Abandon you...Like she did""
(16:48) [Androoh] But that assumes you have to offer them one hundred percent of your being. You don't. You don't even have to love them. 
[Meeko12] But you don't understand...
[Meeko12] I do have to love them.
[Meeko12] Otherwise I wouldn't have been with them in the first place.
[Meeko12] Because I love everybody...
[Meeko12] Because I care even when I don't want to.
[Meeko12] Because I cry, all the time, about everything.
(16:52) [Androoh] Bloody hell. What the fuck Meeko? - you love everyone? Cut the crap lass. Not to be harsh, but the world is full of fucks - Don't just throw the term love around so loosely. You need to be more selective of who you like - if you loved everyone you're more likely to open up than stay back - I don't get it. It's almost as if you're protecting them from yourself. You've made yourself your own enemy!
(16:52) [Androoh] If that sounded harsh, it's because I'm being honest with you. Rather that than someone cutting corners and telling you what you'd like to hear.
[Meeko12] That's probably why it feels so good. ^^;;
[Meeko12] Because somebody finally told me the truth.
[Meeko12] But it's true.
[Meeko12] When I know somebody, i love them. 
(16:55) [Androoh] And if this all stems from someone who might have been harsh in the past, then draw strength from it. That doesn't mean hardening your heart like I do, but it means you're ready for doing it again and not feeling burned as much.
[Meeko12] I love them because...I see past the bad things about them and can only see the good in them. Even if that person had killed another person. I think to myself ""Wow, he must have had a rough life...that poor man..."" I dont think about...why he killed or if he'll do it again. I think about the times he might cry because he killed a person...Or how hard it was to force himself to do something like that. 
[Meeko12] It's not me. I can't...Even her...After she hurt me...
[Meeko12] I still love her.
[Meeko12] Even though she did that.
(17:01) [Androoh] What if the person had zero remorse when they killed the person and took sadistic pleasure in it? Ask yourself that... But if you're more likely to see the good in people, then how come you're acting as if you're the bad guy for it. Don't be a mug... Life is a balance of good and bad. If someone see's you as being overly trusting they -might- abuse it, but if they do - it's not your fault. I get the impression you hold off because like you say, they won't live up to your supposed good impression of them. People are chaotic you can't stand back to much to discern because it's impossible to tell - the best thing to do is to wade into social situations and think 'so fuck' at least I tried. 
(17:01) [Androoh] No one can act on a permanent basis, eh? Life is never a smooth ride.
(17:01) [Androoh] Act good on a permanent basis I mean to say.
(17:02) [Androoh] But hey, I'm just a stranger!
[Meeko12] You're the closest stranger I've ever met. ^^
(17:02) [Androoh] I might be totally off the mark. In which case, tell me to shut my stupid face if you want. I can take it! =)
[Meeko12] I couldn't say that if I tried. ^^;;;
(17:04) [Androoh] Try learning to see the good in yourself as much as you do in everyone else and you'll learn to see that if other people wrong you, they played a part too! 
(17:04) [Androoh] Anyway, I'm off to drain the snake as they say. Back in a bit.
[Meeko12] To be completely honest, you hit a lot of soft spots with me. It usually takes weeks and weeks to do that. Because I don't usually talk about it. But. It felt nice to just let somebody pick my mind. And just let everything go...
[Meeko12] I like talking with you, so, don't become a stranger. ^^
(17:05) [Androoh] You know where to find me.
(17:08) [Androoh] But remember to take peoples shit with a grain of salt. Being trusting of people isn't a weaknesses as long as you realise humans are fundamentally selfish. Learning to like people means you accept they're out for themselves. It's perhaps cynical to say that, but even romantic love is a selfish act. 
(17:09) [Androoh] When I say they're out for themselves, it means whilst they're equipped to get on with you. They don't owe you a good time.
(17:09) [Androoh] But I waffle on. And you know what your issues are better than anyone.
(17:09) [Androoh] You don't need to be lectured my dear. =)
[Meeko12] You know-
[Meeko12] I guess I am a little selfish then. ^^
[Meeko12] Because I do want romantic love. ^^ 
(17:11) [Androoh] Ohh yeah, I was having this conversation with a friend of mine the other day. On the subject of love... Romantic love is nice to experience, but it's all about what pleasure the other person -gives you-.
(17:11) [Androoh] I only speak about the initial stages.
[Meeko12] Yep.
(17:12) [Androoh] I am not totally cynical. I do believe there is such a thing as selfless acts of love.
(17:12) [Androoh] Where you do something for someone else and not just for your sake.
[Meeko12] I believe that too. 
[Meeko12] Just as when people cry over death.
(17:13) [Androoh] But only later on, when you realllyyyy knowwww the person.
[Meeko12] It's selfish. ^^;; 
[Meeko12] Because they are all thinking. ""I wanted that person here, I wish that person could stay""
(17:13) [Androoh] In a sense yes! =)
[Meeko12] They aren't thinking...
[Meeko12] ""I hope they go to a better place""
[Meeko12] Then again, what would I know..
[Meeko12] The only death I experienced that meant anything to me is when I was 1 years old.
[Meeko12] ^^;;
[Meeko12] It feels weird going to funerals and sitting there watching the people closest to you cry...when you cant start to imagine what type of person the one laying in the casket is.
(17:17) [Androoh] Ahh yeah I know exactly what you mean. I've been to three funerals [one of them was my uncle] and even though I had a connection with the person who died on some level. I didn't feel bad or even... particularly bad they died. I just shrugged. I hate to say it, but it's totally out of our hands. At the same time, you'd think my own admission I'd be stirred into living life to the extreme based on the fact I seem equipped to accept it happens more readily than the rest of my family.
(17:18) [Androoh] particularly sad* Not particularly bad.
[Meeko12] Yep.
(17:19) [Androoh] I think I need an epiphany like yourself from the sounds of things. A cosmic answer or piece of life's jigsaw puzzle.
(17:20) [Androoh] I wish I could just... be excited about the good stuff out there.
[Meeko12] Somebody really close to me died when I was 1 year old...But...I couldn't cry then because I didn't understand. And now I don't know why to cry because I can't remember them. I just know they were special and now they are gone. ^^;; And I wish I could have met that person casually now. So I could thank her. I mean, I'm not even christian...so it's not like I believe in heaven and that she's watching down on me. So I don't even know where to turn. 
[Meeko12] You seemed pretty excited about this conversation. Most people call me emo and play me off like a joke. But I liked talking about things that somebody could contemplate and think about like I did...And try to give answers. And try to understand..
(17:27) [Androoh] Yeah, that's probably better I think though it can leave one rather numb believing that once you're dead - that's it. You don't go anywhere, there isn't a magical disney castle with people in white smilling and waving etc. You're recycled and whatever spark... divine or whatever that made your body leap into action is now being re-used or even just used up entirely. It feels like with the bleaker view one's attachment to the person whose gone should be enhanced, but for me at least it doesn't... It kinda reinforces my view that we're just glossing over the fact we're as fragile as the cows/chickens we butcher everyday to eat on the dinner table. Life is fleeting... I'm not totally removed of any affection though for the persons gone though and I believe remembering the good bits is fundamental in dealing with the loss assuming it has made an effect... Well, in any case, passing on that  mode of thought to others who choose to dwell on their own selfish thoughts of what they've lost based on what the dead person gave them... *Deep breath*
(17:28) [Androoh] I love these type of conversations. Seriously... Whilst I think over analysing things can be bad in some respects, I'll never stop doing it. I'm a hypocrite in that respect! =)
[Meeko12] I'm pretty stupid like that too.
[Meeko12] Sometimes I could sit here and listen to people talk for hours.
[Meeko12] I like hearing your thoughts. It makes me second thought some of my own. Because a lot of them make sense.
[Meeko12] Almost to the point where I think...""what was I doing since the beginning?""
(17:30) [Androoh] Lol - that's the green light that we should be out there procreating mindlessly.
(17:31) [Androoh] As another jaded friend said to be in a rather cynical fashion - 'Everything is just a diversion from the desire to screw'. =)
[Meeko12] Lololololol
[Meeko12] I dont know if I should be laughing.
[Meeko12] But.
[Meeko12] That seemed so funny to me. :P"

As<br>long as you have great friends, a great<br>personality, and a great outlook on life,<br>you'll be fine. You've got people around you<br>who are willing to keep you up when you fall<br>down, which you have many times. You have great<br>talents as a writer, especially when you write<br>fantasy. You are the dreamer, the sarcastic<br>one, and the one with great come-backs. Keep on<br>dreaming, and you're sure to have an extreme,<br>life-it-to-the-fullest, Grade-A life!

Lol. 

Well. I just want to start off fresh. I should go back and delete my other journal. Not that it matters...I don't think there is anybody who will read this besides a select few. That's all I really want too, but it doesn't matter too much. 

I need to feel around for a good layout. I like this format, but I hope for a more picture like background. Maybe Saku can help me with that <3~ 

We'll see...

Anyways...

Testing, Testing...

1, 2, 3?

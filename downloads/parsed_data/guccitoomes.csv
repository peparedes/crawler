walks through the garden rows with her bare feet laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters
I walk on down the hill through grass grown tall and brown
and still it's hard somehow to let go of my pain
on past the busted back of that old and rusted cadillac
that sinks into this field collecting rain
will I always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged...
of these cutthroat busted sunsets, these cold and
damp white mornings I have grown weary
if through my cracked and dusty dime-store lips
I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me?
lay your blouse across the chair, let fall the flowers from your hair and kiss me with that country mouth so plain
outside the rain is tapping on the leaves
to me it sounds like they're applauding us the quiet love we make
will I always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged...
well I looked my demons in the eyes, laid bare my chest, said do your best to destroy me
you see, I been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kind of bore me
there's a lot of things that can kill a man
there's a lot ways to die, yes and some already dead that walk beside me
there's a lot of things I don't understand, why so many people lie,
it's the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me

will I always feel this way?
so empty, so estranged...

how can you be so fucking sure of yourself? i could've sworn, fucking SWORN what he was implying. i was fooling myself...like mad. and i had no idea. none. thank goodness this whole semester i've been becoming less and less attached instead of more. that doesn't change the fact that i feel like an ass.
fuck me. i'm a fucking idiot. and yes i will fucking beat myself up for this.
don't even have a heart to heart with someone past 1 in the morning i've learned. your emotions are on too high and you end up getting fucked.
your right...lets not let this hurt the friendship...
first before agree to that let me cross my fingers, walk under a latter, spill some salt, and break a mirror.
because lets face it, you're not getting the bad end of this, i am. i'm going to feel fucking awkward and fucking beat myself up for this.
""i think in this situation there's two ends""
your right, and on your end i just unintentionally gave you all the leverage.
brag assface, brag.

i feel like venting to a computer screen. but only a lil bit heh.
i'm glad theres a place to come home to, to regain your ground.
am i excited to go back to school? oh man...
i've been unable to come up with a definite answer to this. 
i think i have many fears. fears that i'm afraid to share or even acknowledge.
but hey, what the hell, who reads this shit anyway...
i think when i think of school, what burns in the back of my mind is the feeling of being trapped when i'm there. I noticed recently that i never go through periods of depression when i'm home, whereas at school, the stress of it academically as well as socially can bring some wear and tear. i suppose thats slightly besides the point, but the feeling of being trapped comes from...lets be honest...certain friends. some of the most emotionally dependent and deprived people i think i've ever met or gotten to know. it can be such a burden. i would never tell them this, i don't think they should know. <b>I think it would be selfish to tear someone down only to relieve a burden you may feel.</b> anyway, so thats one reason, when i think of school, i associate it with the difficulty of maintaining some friendships i guess. sometimes they can just feel so draining, and i don't feel that when i'm at home. at home there aren't any real ""draining"" friendships. 
i can barely keep my eyes open, but i'm gonna keep goin for a bit longer.
I think i'm just on a different level. Most people seem to see at sea-level, but I run at 1500 ft. above. does that mean they're more grounded? i dunno, i don't know what any of that means, i just thought it'd be neat to say.
i'm slightly worried about next semester and the new roomie. i don't know why, I just am. I've never had real roommate troubles before, we shall see. 
At school sometimes i just feel the need to cut myself off from everyone else. why is that?? why is it that i can't seem to find anyone i really relate to there? damn. 
I do think i love being there though. i'm pretty sure.

i can't stay awake, i'm going to reconsider all of this later."

hi.
why not, its not like i have a another physiology test to fail tomorrow. fuck shit happens.

tonight was cool, this past week overall has been rad. started kinda bumpy with the rents gone. just weird, not a fan of change.
however me n lisa have been hanging out alot recently which i'm stoked about. i forgot how cool she was. we were bestie's in hs then after graduation, well we know how that goes. but for sure twin towers forever, we kick ass. we take the world by storm. haha, maybe not, but we have fun. 
hanging out this past week has made me remember what i love about home, and why i miss it when i'm at school. I stepped back for a sec and compared the two which maybe i shouldn't do cuz that just develop's bias, but whatever. i think part of me wouldn't mind not going back to biola, but once i do i'm sure it'll be fine, it usually is. but seriously, as much as I love southern california, lol some people there are...holy cow.  I get caught up in it when i'm there, but when i come home I realize what real friends are and whats really important. I've never met so many people who are so concerned with their image/appearance. like their world revolves around it.(not to make such a broad generalization, but i think i've met enough of them its ok to say...) not that i don't care about it, but theres so much more to life.
ugh, i wouldn't trade my friends from home for anything or anyone. and you wouldn't understand if you weren't from here i think.

""...she's having her work out all time so she's starting to look better...""
shit like that throws me off. thats whats bringing this all on. 
its not their business, its none of their concern.
oh well, everyone thinks differently i suppose...it just makes me not want to hang out with those people.

on another note, i've never met so many gays in my life haha. but its cool, its been fun. ha, so these two gay guys asked lisa and I if we wanted to be their first ""girl experience""...we said no. however i suppose it was a nice complement? lol weeeeird. apparently lately the guys i've been attracted to are gay lol, damn.
my heart broke just a lil when i found out that clinton from what not to wear was gay. oh well haha...

i love my friends they're chill, home is chill, it always has been.

bike trip in...count it: 11days.

damn, i missed free slurpie day at 7-11 again. i forget every year. i remember the night before but always forget day of. i probably wouldn't have slurped(?) it, but i just wanna be able to say i got a free one on july 11th. next year...next year...

so my music right now consists of amy winehouse, KT tunstall, paolo nutini, brandi carlile, pharoahe monch, and Paul McCartney's ""dance tonight"". all of which are worth an ear or two. (this is not a subjective opinion either....= D )

this stupid mouse won't eat the fuckin cheese on the mouse trap. i'd be more upset i suppose if i didn't see ratatouille. so now theres the theory that it can cook gourmet meals, and if so its ok. i'm sorry i just wasted part of your life by reading this.

aight, i'm sleepy, since i'm not getting any studying done i'll be up early in the mornin. 'night.

surprise. i'm writing on livejournal. take into consideration the time, i'm already half numb/asleep. school kills, takes lives, its taking mine. well...tonight anyway, possible in the next couple weeks to come as well. as sucky as life in school/finals world is right now, God's working.

so hey...happy mother's day. probably one of the worst mothers days b/c i really did miss my mom. I sent her a box of goods that she got on saturday, and I called her, sent her an e-card, a telegraph, a candy gram, a stripper...etc. mmk, so maybe not all that but at least the first few. 

last night i decided i wanted to go to church, and my friend ty wanted to brave leaving at 8:15 on a sunday morning with me. that was neat. we have fun times together. but thats beside the point. i think i teared up at least five times during the service. Rock harbor is an amazing church. I applaud them for their successful attempts to keep their focus and mission despite being a large fast growing church in the middle of your stereotypical Orange County town.(which is really one of my fav areas haha) anyway, getting off track again...
I'm too tired to get into all the details of the service, but i just came to grips and realization with many things. but i'll just mention one of the majors. 
I've been battling the question of why it is really so important to go to church.and yes i grew up in the church so i know all the right answers if someone would bring the same dilemma to me heh. however its always different when its personal? notice that? those answers to the same questions for some reason don't apply. weird.
I told myself before I went to bed last night that i needed to go, i knew it'd be worth it for some reason. and it blew my mind. 
the songs at the end of the service brought out the fire in me that i had been keeping dimmed since probably sometime in hs. The songs they chose were a blessing, they said what i needed to hear. I had forgotten what it was like to be apart of a corporate worship where you can express your heart to God. Those lyrics somehow seem to fit with what you're experiencing, making it comforting to know that whoever wrote them went through similar trials and circumstances. 
Singing from the soul.singing from the soul. my soul sang this morning.
it sang so hard that words could hardly come out. i don't know how else to explain it. 
does this mean, all of a sudden i'm a whole new person? no. thats not what this is about. coming to terms with what you're going through. we're not called to be perfect, we're called to seek his face. earnestly. let our souls sing and not hinder them by our selfish ambitions.
i'm rambling, but this is for me not you.
i love my parents. i want to love them like they love me but i don't know how. i don't know how to love like that. Its a God thing, and they are far ""Godlier"" than I am. and i'm not saying that as a bad thing, i'm saying that there's room to grow. i'm saying that there's forgiveness and new beginnings. i'm saying that i love my parents, because they are a gift from God. we just never see it as that.


people are bothering me, but whats it matter, it doesn't. we are to love. 
(...
and when i say that, it is not the ""we are to love"" cliche thing that people say just to sound profound and artsy lol, fuck that. fuck trying to sound unique just so someone will have a view that you're different, special, artistic, shit. WE ARE NOT DEFINED BY THE WAY WE USE OUR ENGLISH GRAMMAR AND DICTION, OR THE STYLE OF CLOTHES WE WEAR, OR WHAT WE WANT TO ""PURSUE""!!!......fuck all of that. stop kidding yourself, you are defined by what you believe. who you are in christ and whether you honestly pursue his will. become who God wants you to be, and give that persona. because thats the only honest persona you can give.)
and even i can be hypocritical, because like the rest, i fall into the same trap.

tangent? yes, very much so. but thats how i feel about that topic lol. 

only two more weeks, and summer is here. i'm so stoked. SO stoked. but then i realize all the amazing people i've become friends with this year that are leaving. and i don't want the year to end. 

mark. you're one of the coolest kids i know.
and i don't think i'll ever see you again in two weeks.
but you already know somewhat how i feel about that.
i'm more honest when i'm drunk.
i didn't let you kiss me, i didn't wake up with any regrets.    (except that i'm more honest when drunk lol)
= )..........= (

to summarize this year...
""are you chill?""
""fuck. fuck school. i'm fucked""
waking up wishing i didn't do that.
new friends, new experiences. better friends, amazing experiences.
ps. you really don't know me. all you do is make assumptions, all i want to do is prove them wrong.

and today, I saw the love of christ that i've been missing out on for far too long.
crazy year, but its coming to a good end.
 
this is a long livejournal, but i'm overdue i suppose.
btw, my excuse is i've been studying anatomy like crazy and its now 4:15 in the morning. = )"

i'm going to write about life because i don't like sleeping when i haven't gotten in bed yet. but once i do, bam, there's no turning back haha.

i don't like being personal or detailed on here but shit happens.
i'm not a big on being super open i always leave out important facts, i'm much more of a listener than talker, but i always need someone to listen every once n awhile, and i end up talking for days. rambling. then forgetting everything i just said. and all of a sudden i feel like i'm writing an ""about me"" for myspace or some gay ass site like that lol. so i'll stop.
friends ARE what make me run smoothly. i'm thinking about all the amazing people that i have in my life, and whats there to do but simply thank GOd. i'm going to make a list, just watch me. (k, so i'm a little hyper right now...)

katie-thanks for letting me randomly load unload all my stupid guy issues on you tonight, one of those, i need to spill for a sec...or two. 

mark-you're amazing. and i say that in a very non-sexual way ha. your girlfriend is lucky to have someone like you. it was fun talking about the personal shit that we've experienced and our life goals. we think alike. hopefully we won't fit any mold someone has for us but God's, ireland will be one of the many places on your passport.

josiah-i loved talking to you tonight. you have no idea some of the shit i've done, and i'll probably tell you someday. thanks for staying close and loving like a brother should. i'm proud of everything you're achieving by being in the navy, i can't wait to see you and have another long late night talk like old times. you're one of the few that understands life at home.

kristen-thanks for calling, its little things like that, being willing to listen for a few and interested in how i'm doing that makes a big difference to me. i love how you're such a dreamer, and ur not afraid to try and reach them.

james-i don't know what tonight was about, but i'm always there for you, and i know ur always there for me. you've helped get me through rough times, God has a plan and purpose for you, believe that and don't forget. (even when its not always clear right away)

tyler-you're cool. don't be an ass, and don't be a stranger. we used to have some good times.

there's lots of amazing people in my life, these are just a few that touched me today. God is amazing, more amazing than I or anyone will ever be able to fathom. i need to keep reminding myself that. Mark and I decided, or recognized more like it, you'll never be happy if you don't do what you love. forget trying to reach acceptance, you'll only be happy if you accept yourself, everyone else's opinions will no longer matter. remember that nothing is about us though, we are to live for others, not for their approval per se, but to put others' needs before ours. this might sound contradictory, but if you know what i'm getting at then you understand. maybe you don't, but this is more for my own reminder and if you get something out of it then praise Jesus. literally. = ) God's amazing, we are not our own, i should get in bed, i want to go to church tomorrow = D (john, i swear ur comments drive me crazy lol...please stop being a smart ass)

no one could take me seriously if i revealed them, but thats ok. although many times thats what brings us down, i try and use it to make me stronger. thats what i need to do. i don't care how unrealistic i may seem.
i talked to my brother tonight. i probably talk to him once every 2-3 months. its funny in a not so funny way, because we used to be close. when we don't speak to someone we build up ideas of them in our mind, of what they're doing, how they're living, and their perspective of us. which we have both done. lame.
i want to be what no one expected. i hate the feeling that people look at you and think nothing. we only have one shot at life, and average and ordinary isn't something i will strive for. i don't want to get stuck. i want to be greater than you expected.

on tuesday i went to a bible study, and i was blown away. have you ever felt just so deeply impacted by God's word? if you haven't, or not recently, its something you miss out on. now that i'm not living in the church 24/7, those moments seem rare, but dang...when they come, its more than what you could ever ask for. feeling/being close to God. we forget how amazing it is, we take it for granted and don't savor it like we should. i know its something you can have everyday, but i don't. just another priority to work out. so many priorities...so many ""resolutions"".

i kept zoning today, everywhere we went. we would sit there and i would just zone out while the world around me kept going. sometimes i just want to be invisible, disappear or something. and i mean that in the least emoish way possible lol.

"event","i think i'm passing the tests. i could be wrong. but i know i'm not failing.
and with that I am happy.


""are you happy?""-my dad asked me that the other day. i've never been asked that before. ever.
""why? do i not look like a happy person?""-with a big smile on my face.
""that wasn't the question...""- in my mind i say fuck...i don't know the answer.
""i guess so, i'm not not happy...""-this scared me...i couldn't stop thinking about it.
*we continued on, changing the subject*

i'm confused. which is something I wouldn't normally admit to. i've never been asked, i've never thought about an answer until now. what does it mean to be happy? a society based on unsatisfaction. a constant need of fulfillment in all the wrong areas. none of it brings satisfaction...thus the need for being content in God. of course. however thats what we're supposed to say, think, do, whatever. but to think about it as it pertains to yourself seems to be a harder conclusion to put into play. i still don't know the answer, because i keep trying to figure out how to know for sure...
growing up being told all the right answers seems to leave you with an empty space between the problem and the solution. does that make sense? because we're taught (for example) drugs, sex, alcohol, its all bad, its all sin. the answer? it is JESUS. ...............ok. its always objective, never subjective. we know the answers but we don't know how to apply it to our own lives once WE, ourselves,  are faced in a difficult situation. because life is always easier said than done.

""talk is cheap...people can say whatever they want to say""-another quote by my dad the other day.
so fking true. even in my own life...too many of my words are cheap. hopefully these are not = /

tonight was another party...i wasn't too excited to go, but my friend wanted to. a few sips, put it aside, i'm done. its not me, its not who i want to be. i love meeting new people...but as i met people tonight, i didn't care. yes he's cute, but i don't want to get to know him. its hypocritical in a sense, but if they're wasted off their ass at a party, i don't care about who they are because i can see  what their priorities are. they are not mine. is that wrong? maybe...but i'm growing right now, i'm learning more and more about what's important. and parties are not. 
i used to be goodygoody cuz i had never done anything and didn't know any better or any different. now i'm turning more goodygoody again because i've experienced things, and learned that it's not what i want for myself and who i want to be.

I'm not at all out of the woods, i know that...and in reality there's probably no such thing...there will always be another chunk of woods to struggle through = )

i'm doing so much better. in multiple areas.
since the night i spent in the bathroom (heh) i have not been drunk or even near drunkeness(word?) since. i've had lots of opportunities, but everytime i've either not had any, or taken some sips and couldn't drink any more. ha, damn i sound like some kind of alcoholic...i assure you that was never the case. but i'm one that doesn't like to make the same mistake more than once. i fuck up once, i don't want to do it again. obviously i'm not perfect, but i strive to at least not be caught rolling downhill.
i also had a long talk with my mom a couple weeks ago...that was...interesting. but good. i love her, she's great. she's also def. a mom. 
I've been going to church more. go me. ha, sometimes i find it rediculous when people assume that you attendence to church determines your spiritual walk. please...
anyway...i'm doing more of what i love, making more art, working out when i can, cooking, cleaning (which isn't always the worst thing in the world...) taking advantage of  my break. i don't remember the last time i was really bored. b/c when you honestly think about it, there's no reason for boredom. I've come to that conclusion. we get bored often, yes, but its our own fault, its our own laziness.
annnd the boy dept. lol, eff it ha!. naw, i've gone on some dates...i don't like any of them rawr. lol. i'm rediculously picky. oh well.

after last night, i don't want to do it anymore. i'm tired of that game, that circle. part of me knows i'm prolly just saying this now after a bad experience, and i'll just go back to doing whatever, but in all honesty...i wanna change. i want to be better. i want to be a good example, i don't want a label. I'm giving myself a label, but when you think about it, i think everyone is labeled. if I don't drink smoke or anything, then you're a goodygoody. i used to get that alot and hated it, and now i'm giving myself the party lable or whatever and i'm not happy with that either.

Where did I find you, when did I decide to look? 
You are toxic, and my denial is the only Validation to my Addiction.
My world spins as my arms become Limp and Useless.
Nothing matters when you decide to INHALE.
Take a deep Breath, You're only creating more memories. Hear that song? It will be that Trigger, what will ignite Today?
Light a match, create a coal taht will decide your security, prove your INsecurity.
You used to be so good, you used to be so proud,
Now take a deep breath, and Float among the Clouds.
What a good child, what a sheltered naiive flame.
Lighting up an empty dark room. 
You led a path, but had not saved, just Listen.
Take another in your hand, Slip away, The world Spins, you go Limp. 

You worthless Flame."

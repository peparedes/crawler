"event","Today was awesome! Me and Natalie woke up today at about 7:00 in the morning. We just kinda layed in bed half asleep.So then we got up and got dressed then headed over to the church. When we got there we put our stuff on the bus. We went inside for a lil then we left for CANOBIE! On the way up Natalie , me, and Sammi sat in the back were there are three seats.So yeah... we all kinda slept for like 10 minutes..but Natalie thinks she slept for an hour lol ..but anyway We got there around noon and got our tickets. Then me,sammi,natalie,and jamie decided to go on the til-ta-whirl or whatever.It was very hard to fit 4 people. So after that we met up with Andrea, Ethan, Josh, and Justin and we went on the Cork Screw ..It was wicked fun!.So after that we walked around and went on some more rides then got icecream. After that we went on the Boston Tea Party and got soaked.But yeah  We checked in at the carasel at about 4:00 then we left to go on the Yankee Cananball.The first time me,sammi,natalie,and jamie were the next ones on the ride but it was thundering out and it was about to rain but we got on then it started to poor.but as we were on it I hear sammi saying ""My boobs"" ""My boobs"" lol.But after we got off it was pouring really hard and thundering out so everyone there shut down the rides and everyone went under a stand. But we decided to dance in the rain which was a lot of fun. So after that we went on the Yankee Cananball again with Beth and her cousin Katie and Ruthanne.We got off the ride and decided to go on the boston tea party. there was no line because it was wet out and kinda cold. So we went on it about 5-6 times in a row.At about 6:46 or so we headed to the carasel to leave.And on the way home we stopped at BK and slept..That was pretty much it.But yeah ...Ill write later"

"event","Hey! ..today was wicked fun.I woke up at about 12 and natalie came over. We dyed her hair! it was fun.Then we decided to mop my kitchen floor but it turned into a slip n slide.lol. We put soap and oil and water on the floor and put trash bags on as dresses and we would slide on our stomaches back and forth as we blasted music. It was wicked fun..so then we changed and watched a movie..Then my parents went out and so did my brother so we did another slip n slide.Then I went to my friend Josh's house for pizza and we hung out and played video games.Then later he decided to join us for our slip n slide contest. He slid on the floor right into the wall which was soo funny.But anyways today was an awesome day...untill I talked to ""someone"" ..lets just call him George. I really dont know whats going on with him i like him soo much but its really hard to tell if they like u back even when ur going out.But anyways besides that my day rocked..so ill write lata"

well id say that this last week and a bit since i last wrote has been a great one. whats the best thing that happened? oh yeh i was langers on thursday night, thats not the good bit, id been at my local, the sine, and then i decided to go and see a band at a cute venue called the lobby. anyway i swear that my drink got spiked or i might have just chukked a whitey, i dont know anyway i felt sick didnt say good bye to anyone and walked on home. (too my new big house, more about later). So friday i wasnt feeling that grand, had to work the lunch shift and then managed to walk into town back to the old house and pick up my last bibs and babs, because i have soo much stuffff....not. anyway got home shattered friday night about 8 ready for a glass of wine a pasta cook up and a big sleep. ofcourse there is no point in planning anything too much. anyway 8pm the phone rings, ding ding. Phoebe its katrina willy has a ticket to christie moore and he doesnt want to go do you want to go? i was like im a bit tired and willy is in the background saying it would be an absolute sin if i dont and it starts now hell be round to pick me up in five mins. So to cut a long story short i got a front row seat in the cork opera house to see christie moore and whats better he was being supported by his brother luka bloom, another amazing musician, and whats more i had been listening to loads of christie moore the last week thinking that it would be great to see him and whats more i actually thought he was dead. SO that was fekking amazing. i had a few tears in my eyes there and the crowd was singing along when requested ofcourse which was amazing and my fav was micheal hatten. 'let the fiddle playing and poitin cure your company up above'
wednesday i got a modern hair cut thing with this blondy bit at the front and on one side. they made me do it at the hairdressers, it was a training thing you know and they cut it a few weeks back and then they said weve got great plans for the colour and i was like no you dont im not trendy anymore and they said 430pm in two weeks its only twenty euro and fekkin three hours sitting there like a guinea pig anyway its alright, not too exotic. new house yeh. its got three double rooms and a garden and its nice, greg used to live there. the markets were a little quieter on satday, willy decided not to go to waterford so we had the top notch stall set up but there wasnt enough space so it was on the vertical kinda thing. but its an improvment. oh no the stall wasnt vertical it just wasnt facing the way the other stalls were facing but you could still walk down the side and so we were both there i was looking after molly most of the day and i think i want a baby now aswell karl, if you want we could, but weve have to have twins so we could have one each. molly stood up with no hands on sat was very cute. hope anyone who reads this is well. im off to the mutton lane pub now for a pint and then there is a good traditional session at the sine so i might go along for a wee while. x"

"event","perhaps if i didnt come to the internet place on fridays when there is really only one place i should be then i would feel more like babbling into this thing. coz its friday and im really not in typing mood. I do it for a reason, i know very well why i come to the internet place on fridays its because i know i must get up at 630am on saturdays for the markets and i think that by coming just once a week on fridays it will somehow be exciting enough to distract me from the pub which i try sooo hard to avoid on friday for obvious saturday morning reasons. but when you have the two best traditional music nights on both the friday and the sunday what am i to do when i have to work the sunday night and dilkes the one i kinda fancy is playing guitar at them but the music anyway is great and well i should probably just go home smoke a splif and go to sleep yeh i could or i couldnt, i dont even want to work on sunday night because its mollys birthday. molly molly. well today i bought a cd player. i have many questioning things surrounding my head about house and job. except for the organic market stall there is something not quite right about job and something not quite right about house. both are grand enough but i deserve to beable to be a little picky and i know i could do better in both departments. oh yeh but last night i had a business plan right i was thinking you know how you get these postcards of like the front of irish bars with like a slanted old man holding a guiness or something well with the smoking ban in pubs ive decided to make some poscards saying welcome to ireland with loads of people hanging out in the street in front of pubs smoking. millions, i reckon ill make millions, hehehehehe. got to go cobbas"

Ive been seeing a guy called dilkes almost every night since sunday when we decided we would go home and snozzle. hes lovely and has the best collection of tradtional music in tape form that ive ever seen. He plays at a pub called the sine on the tradtional nights. I finally got offered a good job in hamburg but oh, im in ireland. Proper photography work after the sucess of the photos of dara.

"event","Then he asked if he could stay and i was that tired i didnt give a fuck i just said ok but i really need to sleep. Before i friggin knew it he was naked beside me telling me to get naked and saying that he wants so badly to make love to me. I was fucking freaking, in a phoebe relaxed way, all i could think of way Katrina and Molly. And ofcourse i told him that and he said 'thats life man, things happen man, from the moment i saw you i just wanted this to happen, thats why i came around, blah di blah blah'. I ended up saying that he would have to leave if he didnt stop and go to sleep. Unfortunaly i couldnt relax and enjoy the good sex that it may well have been because of the girlfriend, who i get on brilliantly with. So i put it down to drugs and alcohol and we kept it quiet and, that was last sunday, fuckin last night there he was at the sine pub. It was great to see him like, remembering this guy saved carly and myself from sleeping on the street in kenmare, and we had a few drinks then i said i was off home and he was too so ... anyway i just relised that this is going on the internet and that not cool so i dont want to write anymore. Why me? is all i can say. thankgod i dont feel too much for him otherwise dangers could occur but im just going to have to be extremely firm. I think he just wants to shag and get it out of his system, thats what he said but thats just as bad. 

Carl your james taylor man is playing in killarney in a few weeks i think. 

Im soooo very excited about next sunday im going to go and see the man himself mr kris kristoffersen in Killarney. Im going with willy actually and some of his friends so this is where phoebe must be good. I think we will go on the saturday back on the monday. Kris Kristoffersen is about 124 years old so i hope he manages to pull off a few of his brilliant works of art.

The bar im working at is an oldies locals bar a little bit out of town, 20 minutes walk or so. Its not very busy at all but the people who drink in there are serious drinkers so it kinda feels busy. ive only done a couple of friday night shifts, i never work sats or suns ( just at the markets) and so i do like the lunch shift in the kitchen and on the floor. Its really easy just sandwiches and toasties and soup and a chefs special and taytos. Now i am exhausted from all the typing.

If you go into finnegans net net can you do me that little favour i asked to greg.

Now obviously the voice mail thing must have been a case of phoebe not locking the keypad of the mobile whilst walking as Annette guessed. Carl i told you i will keep you informed with my irish romances but im not actually going to call you up during them ok. That sounded really rude. 

I probably wont be writing again for a while after that but its good to get it down. I dont know anyone here well enough to talk to about that kinda thing. Everything will be fine aslong as i dont start to like willy, which i dont think i will as he remeinds me of my dad when i was little. 

you came around to me one night
you wanted to hold me oh so tight
all i could think of was your girls
all you wanted were my pearls

you took off all of your clothes
as i hid my face from your nose
you moved your hand up towards my breast
when all i wanted was rest

willy why do have to come round
im at a stage
not wanting to be
found

you have to imagine it with guitar and my great voice.

"event","OK well i think its time for me to stop writing silly bits of nonsense and explain a little about whats going on with me here in cork. I think last time i wrote was when Carly and myself were staying out of town on the farm doing the gardening for willy and katrina. Well we stayed there almost a week it was in the end and then we found a place in the city to live. Its an apartment kind of student house with 8 bedrooms a couple of bathrooms and a bit lounge and kitchen space. Its nothing spekky and not such a nice atmosphere as the hamburg flat there but it grand. Everyone gets their own room and its just 50 euro per week with no bills. So we moved in there and found a lot of boys. There were 5 irish boys and one polish lad and us two aussie girls. After a night on the putchine one guy moved out, he was a hairdresser from limerick who was a little odd, then after about another few days carly decided to head back to aus via london after many a year on the road. So now what am i left with. Mark, hes from cork, a little annoying, too friendly like. Colin, hes from Tipperary, really depressed and wont look you in the eye. Brendan and alan, they are both from waterford and they're grand. Greg, the polish guy, hes super duper. We got pissed together last night at a tradtional music session at the sine bar. I absolutely love this bar. Beautiful. Um who else do i live with, oh yeh Ian moved in last night, hes a dj. Hes probably the best looking so far id say but ive only spoken with him once. So its insane im the only girl, i think the landlord should try to get one more at least you know. Ah well. The house is only until the students go back to college which is at the end of august i think so then i look for something else. But the craziest thing that has happened to me, why does this shit always happen to me i want to know? Willy and Katrina who we stayed with are both brilliant. They sell organic fruit and veg at different markets around cork, kerry, waterford etc. I helped willy at the bantry markets a few weeks back and last saturday i went with katrina to the Midleton markets to help out because in two weeks im going to be having my own market stall for them in douglas which is just out of cork. I so much prefer selling organic fruit and veg then pulling pints. Which i am doing aswell. Im working at a bar called the Glenanaar bar mainly just mon-fri 11am until 330pm can not complain about those hours! I nearly fainted on saturday by the way it was scary as fuck. Anyway back to the story. Willy and Katrina have a little baby molly who is lovely. Willy is a little bit off with the fairies, a bit of a stoner, everything is always cool kinda guy. Oh yeh and hes 35. A musician, big sort of hair and bit orange glasses but not wanky at all, actually he reminds me of my dad especially in what he was wearing last night. Cords and a knitted jumper. So i do believe it was a drunken evening at our house, ive been quite well behaved lately and was actually sober in bed trying to sleep, but the fucking racket in the house was insane. Suddenly my door is being basically smashed down and carly, off her head, is saying willys here willys here. I stumbled down stairs at about 3am for about the 10th time, pjs the works, tired as fuck. and had a little chat to willy who had just popped around to see our flat at 3am? So he said show me your room so i did and we smoked a spliff and he played some old cork tunes on the guitar i played him carly and my song i wrote, that a beauty. im going to send this in because knowing my luck ill lose all of it in a minute"

"event","lads im grand. Karli and i are gardening away and walking miles a day trying to work out whats going on. We are living about 7kms out of cork on a lovely property and pretty much we do a couple of hours gardening a day and they give us yum yum vegetarian meals and a bed. The couples names are willi and katrina. They do Markets with an organic food store, they import most of the organic food but grow some things in there big garden. On friday i went to Bantry and worked with willi at the bantry markets, i was allowed to have as many 14 euro a kilo cherries as i wanted. We got stoned on the way so the day was pretty relaxed. Willi is a huge stoner and hes a muso aswell. Hes fucking brilliant, can even play all my fav kris kristoffersen songs, i think hes going to teach me one. Hes skinnier then you are karl. Today we are going to a pub called Sine (with accent) for a proper irish music session, but i cant drink because i have 50 euro to my name and might just need it to survive. Im happy though and there are bits and pieces of jobs on the go. They have a little 1 year ol baby called molli who we've been playing with aswell-st pauli to a farm is quite a change in lifestyle i must say. We might have a job at a pub called glenenaar and they will let us stay in a three bedroom flat for a live in kinda deal but i just went to look at two rooms (since ive picked up a travelling conpanion) in a student accom place and they were really nice so i dont know what to do yet, will all become clearer in the next few days. Anyway its been a pleasure speaking with you today ladies and gentlemen. Do you know that the last week has and still is the biggest crazyness that i have not even thought about boys at all. Hey did that guy call you yet annette? But when i sort out my shit....."

"event","i guess you could say that it all began long before i had been introduced to jaegermeister. in the early days the sun would shine through the ""shade cloth"". Every australian, well at least I, know that there is a much better word for a shade cloth but after a few afternoon jaegermeisters words escape me, actually to be quite honest words have always escaped me. im like a sive whose holes get larger and larger after every drink or even after every day. Metaphorically this could mean numbers of things but im thinking about my brain. Not too much sun would come in, the shade cloth had a much better idea of its reason to be put on the earth then i do. It was the day before xmas and i was setting up the xmas tree. Because it was hot and in Australia i didnt think id use christmas decorations, the reflextion would harm eyes. So i made the pheebee veebee xmass treeee. I master piece even if i do say so myself. the tree sat there peacefully, perhaps a little boozy in the corner of sunnys backpackers and the different cultures of people who were in one way excited to be away from the normal christmasssses but in another way excited to be spending a special time in a far away place. I liked this stage of my life, i had a lovely room in a lovely house and was on holidays from studing. The government was still paying me though. You can cheat them very well if you go on holiday, good old centrelink, weve always got on ok.

"event","OMG!!! i just got back from camp like an hour ago (Camp Molly Laumen). Yea...this was my fourth year. i had so much fun and i went w/ dana and its a sleep away and we left last sunday. we always go horse back riding and we stayed at the ranch. the ranch is so much nicer then the tents! but we went on the over night trail ride which is fun but a lot of work and we have to sleep in the little pop-up tnents which took us an hour to put up. Taz and Mr. Taz hasd to help. We were supposed to stay 2 nights but voted to stay ine cause we would have gotten to have an extra lesson on thurs. but unfortunately it thunderstormed and we didnt. we would have learned to jump and canter and i was so excited but instead we lunged w/ the horses which was awesome. my horse was Flow who was new this yr., a very soft tall quarter horse, the tallest in the barn. she got her name because of her smotth flowing trott, canter and gallop. she was 27 but i thought she was like 10. i loved her. my counselors were Junior~Sara, Quackers~Mallory, Prisci~Priscilla and Taz~Leighanne, who lives at the ranch w/ her husband and gets payed by the girl scout camp to watch the 11 horses. Riding was awesome and so were the 7 other girls in my unit. except there was one girl though who was extremely rude and lazy. yea...we have so many insiders~PETER! PETER! lol, get out of the street homies!, Dukey...

I had fun but imissed my friends here, but at least stacie went on vacation and she had fun down at six flags. well, not much else but i have girl scout day camp next week and its my b-day on monday!!! buh bye"

I had a lot of fun this weekend.

Friday- i went to red, whits and boom with dana, at her dad's office. yea it was on the garage roof of columbia gas whaich was a great view!! it was fun and we got a fried twinkie. it was surprisingly really good!!!

Saturday-  I took dana and stacie to see Spiderman 2. it was a great movie. Then I went home and went to church with dana, after that stacie, dana, and I walked to jordan's house for a cook-out. claire and alex were there too. it was fun. then stacie's mom picked us all up and took us to TWHS for the fireworks. then dana and stacie came back to my for a sleepover, we stayed up until like 2 in the morning it was fun.

Sunday- stacie, dana, and i went to the parade in worthington hills, it was kind of boring but whatever, then we went to dana's house to swim, jordan, claire and alex were there too. then at seven we all went to jordan's house and roasted marshmellows and played with sparklers and stuff.

Monday- I took dana, stacie, claire, and alex to the zoo. we got to see like all the baby animals. It's funny, most ppl our age go to the mall to hang out, but we go to the zoo, it was alot of fun though, we went on the train ride, which was really slow, and the merry-go-round. then after that we went to mardi gras for ice cream, then i had to get a mouth guard for field hockey cause that started today!

Yea...ummmm...stacie, i stole most of this from ur lj and changed a couple of things cause i'm, too lazy to write my own stuff."

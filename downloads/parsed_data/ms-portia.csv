"event","<br />I&nbsp;heard the funniest story ever.&nbsp; <br /><br />There once was a journalist in 1917, who wrote an article.&nbsp; He wrote the article about the history of the bathtub.&nbsp; Alongside the history of the bathtub, he wrote on the bathtub being installed into the whitehouse for President Milliard Fillmore, which made the invention more accepted.&nbsp; <br /><br />This article automatically became a research item, highly quoted by many people about the bathtub being installed in the whitehouse, its history, and so forth.&nbsp; It then made its way to medical literature and turned into reference material.&nbsp; Even now.&nbsp; People still say the 13th president had the first bathtub in the white house. <br /><br />Ah but the funny twist in this tale about this journalist is this story was a complete lie.&nbsp; A practical joke on his part.&nbsp; Ah but more than just a practical joke, it was a deliberate attempt to test the gullibility of people.&nbsp; His hoax lasted 8 years until Mencken came out and said that its all a lie.&nbsp; <br /><br />His quote:&nbsp; <strong>&quot;It is out of just such frauds, I believe, that most of the so-called knowledge of humanity flows. What begins as a guess&mdash;or, perhaps, not infrequently, as a downright and deliberate lie&mdash;ends as a fact and is embalmed in the history books,&quot; </strong>Henry L. Mencken.<br /><br />But to further this, the hoax still, even after Menckens confession of it being a hoax, lived on.&nbsp; In 1952, President Truman quoted the bathtub in the White house&nbsp;that Menchken wrote, illustrating the progress to public health&nbsp;was being made.<br /><br />This&nbsp;definetly shows how&nbsp;the press is the easiest venue to use as a source of&nbsp;manipulation to influence the populus, and well, we all know&nbsp;how reporting of 'weapons of mass destruction' was&nbsp;indeed a fallacy.&nbsp; The majority is gullible.&nbsp;"

"event","So I&nbsp;havent really blogged in here because I've been renewed with my obsession to my&nbsp; novel.&nbsp; And have been endlesslesly lost in my pursuit to completion.&nbsp; I will not post any excerpts, because I want to get it published.&nbsp; And I clench on to that novel like its another part of my body part.&nbsp; 

In other news.. my novel's grown bigger than me.&nbsp; It's taken on this direction that never in my wildest dreams I&nbsp;thought it would.&nbsp; Its crazy.&nbsp; Its orwelian.&nbsp; Its sci fi even.&nbsp; That.. was purely accidental.&nbsp; And more importantly, its love and philosophy.&nbsp; Politics.&nbsp; Its everything that I am and hope to be. 

I guess, I've been quite inspired from my environmental bio classes/astronomy.&nbsp; And the dark side of the future, where the world is truly headed.&nbsp; The biggest thing that was missing within my novel was the setting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I found it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know it now.&nbsp; It is the world that shall be.&nbsp; 

There is a big part of nature within my novel as well, because, as I've learned so much that we are more part of nature than&nbsp;some think we are.&nbsp; In fact, I recently learned from my science class that many components/elements found in rocks are the exact same as us.&nbsp; This is absolutely fascinating to me.&nbsp; But not surprising, since the source we all came from was the universe which consists of all these compounds, chemicals, and energy reactions.&nbsp; 

But what else is amazing, is that the earth is not an island for us, but merely a planet that is a participant in the universe.&nbsp; Thus we are not bigger than it, but much smaller.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear god, incredibly smaller.&nbsp; &nbsp;And despite the power hungry nature our species possesses, one day we will learn that we are tiny compared to nature, and will not withstand some of the things that will come to be.&nbsp;"

"event","<br /><strong>Aaron (2000ish)</strong><br /><br />So thus my life began on a traveling dream in the form of a train.&nbsp; The&nbsp;constant to and fro, following the route to my lover in the sun or the rain.&nbsp; It didn't take long before I&nbsp;could say the attachment was very strong, felt it in my heart, even if he was so wrong.&nbsp; And yet, he was always just so right.&nbsp; But this has been a repeating tragedy of my life.&nbsp; His beautiful&nbsp;green eyes, soft smile, tender touch.&nbsp; Soothing words that could put my whole soul at ease, but he was also very good at his ambitous tease.&nbsp; <br /><br />With Aaron I did share some tender moments the many nights I spent the night over.&nbsp; His apartment was very small and he held no job.&nbsp; I don't remember what was wrong but he claimed money somehow that there was no need for a job.&nbsp; However, his place was a one room apartment with a bathroom somewhere within the halls, it wasn't very pleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the memory of&nbsp;apartments unpleasantry, therein remains a&nbsp;moment that even now truly melts my heart.&nbsp; One night&nbsp;things turned pretty hot.&nbsp; Again, there's certain parts of life we all wish to forget and parts of this night I&nbsp;did just that, because when I let Aaron go it so broke my heart.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;could never forget, the moment when he lay on his belly allowing me to see the curve of his back.&nbsp; The tip of my finger traced up and down, feeling the heat as I&nbsp;relished each curve his tattoo&nbsp;was painted&nbsp;on.&nbsp; Had I&nbsp;been an artist I would have drawn each curve of his back, and even then, would feel the drawing to be insufficient in capturing such living art.&nbsp; I'd throw the paper out.&nbsp;<br /><br />Aaron always seemed to melt my heart.&nbsp; We were very much alike because we both were such mysteries people wished to tear apart.&nbsp; I tried to penetrate his shell with my eyes, but he was good at hiding what he was.&nbsp; It was the same the other way around.&nbsp; The only brief moment I&nbsp;truly saw&nbsp;a peak of his soul was when his head was down writing thoughts within his journal.&nbsp; And even so, his eyes were hidden so even then penetration was improbable.&nbsp; But in the moment where he&nbsp;let himself become lost in the world of his words, the beauty of his soul shone.&nbsp; I wanted to unravel his sweet mystery, with&nbsp;his permission&nbsp;or alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course it never quite happened.&nbsp; Well, not in the short time allowed.&nbsp; He had&nbsp;a habit I didnt quite approve of and&nbsp;eventually it was too hard to bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, before I&nbsp;move on to&nbsp;that&nbsp;part of the story, let me share another&nbsp;memory.<br /><br />It was the time I was with a friend, and we decided to go to some strange concert.&nbsp; There we met a few people who invited us to what I used to call bufu.&nbsp; Bufu, in the sense that it was a suburb in the middle of nowhere, called&nbsp;Plano.&nbsp; Aaron had called me that night, nearly begging to see me and to&nbsp;come get him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always flattered by his persistance and his soft words&nbsp;I gave in to his pleas.&nbsp; I always, gave in to his pleas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />An hour later he was in my car, on the way to Plano, with the random people we had&nbsp;encountered at a strange concert.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back on it now, I&nbsp;wonder why&nbsp;I had no rational sense.&nbsp; But here was Aaron sitting beside me, holding my hand,&nbsp;dancing with my eyes.&nbsp; In Plano, we walked through this suburb which was like a&nbsp;beautiful country side.&nbsp; No city fog, only clear stars outside.&nbsp; No noisy cars, only quiet sounds of the wind.&nbsp; No smoky smell, only smell of the&nbsp;coming rain.&nbsp; We walked slowly behind the crowd as he held my hand.&nbsp; No words exchanged,&nbsp;he was&nbsp;one of the few where there was no such thing as an awckward silence, but more like, a silence of understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think I&nbsp;may have forgotten the rest so&nbsp;I shall let this night go.&nbsp; Or maybe, I just don't want to remember more.<br /><br />But what I do remember is&nbsp;one of the mornings he bid me goodbye at the train station,&nbsp;our normal routine.&nbsp; Exchanging kisses and embraces, only this time he grabbed my scarf.&nbsp; He said he wanted to keep it, so he&nbsp;could keep me close by&nbsp;with&nbsp;my&nbsp;scent that&nbsp;the scarf bore.&nbsp; How could anyone argue with&nbsp;a gesture as that, so I&nbsp;let him have it and said&nbsp;my goodbye.&nbsp; It was then on that ride that I&nbsp;decided I couldnt bear with his drug habit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could never progress with someone like that, not even a bit.&nbsp; But if only I&nbsp;knew my&nbsp;future then,&nbsp;that pattern was not to be the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I&nbsp;would have&nbsp;stuck around just to get to know him a little bit more, make him a greater memory of <em>that </em>past&nbsp;.<br /><br />I say <em>that</em> past, because he did eventually come&nbsp;back in different parts of my life.&nbsp; But those are tales for another day.&nbsp; I'll let the memory of him rest for today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","A writing assignment I&nbsp;just had to complete for class, figured it would be worthy to post up here.&nbsp; <br /><p><br /><br />George Orwell wrote in &ldquo;Politics and the English Language,&rdquo; that there are certain words that are extremely abused in politics yet have no definite meaning.&nbsp;He highlighted words such as Fascism, socialism, freedom, justice, and of course, democracy.&nbsp;For Fascism, he wrote the word itself really has no meaning but it signifies something &lsquo;not desirable.&rsquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orwell then takes the reader to the word, &lsquo;democracy,&rsquo; in which he points out, has no agreed definition and is resisted from sides when there is an attempt to define.&nbsp;Attached to that, democracy has this air of praise to it.&nbsp; In a video I&nbsp;had to watch for this assignment, neither of the panelists could reconcile on a defintion of democracy, and one of them went so far as to say it was a waste of time to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;Orwell also said that words of this kind are often used in a dishonest way, in which people who use them have their own private meaning but allow others to think it means something different.&nbsp;Senator Ron Paul furthers Orwell&rsquo;s perception and has said that politicians and elites hide behind these words and obscure reality to condition people to associate certain words with positive or negative perceptions.&nbsp;For example, a common synonymous association that is made is democracy with freedom.&nbsp;But Democracy is not freedom.</p><p>&nbsp;Democracy simply means rule by people, rule by majority.&nbsp;A government like this is dangerous, and not compatible with freedom.&nbsp;It is evident that our founding fathers clearly saw this with the way they framed our <i>republican</i> constitution.&nbsp;In fact, the founding fathers had expressed contempt for democracy as a government.&nbsp;They preferred and implemented a republic, which is rule by law.&nbsp;In this context, democracy in the U.S. could be seen as a process, while a Republic is our actual form of government.</p><p>&nbsp;In the Federalist Papers, James Madison clearly expressed his caution of pure democracy as a form of government.&nbsp;He wrote that a pure democracy would not be a cure for the evils of faction and that &ldquo;<a name=""P13""></a>a common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual.&rdquo;&nbsp;He also added that democracies have not only been spectacles of turbulence and contention, but were incompatible with personal security and rights of property.&nbsp;So here, not only do we see his caution of democracy, but we see that even James Madison felt democracy was incompatible with freedom. &nbsp;John Adams too, argued that democracies grant revocable rights to citizens depending on the whims of the masses while a republic secures and protects pre-existing rights.&nbsp;Thus in a Republic the rule of law decides on what is right as opposed to a democracy where people decide on what they want.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Furthermore, even the great ancient Greek philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, who lived in the heart of Democracy, showed displeasure of it in their writings.&nbsp;Plato, in his &ldquo;Republic&rdquo; said that the many lack intelligence and knowledge for governing, but rather are motivated by money, bodily appetites and led by emotions.&nbsp;Along with that, the mass are easily manipulated thus they are unfit to govern.&nbsp;He even expressed in the dialogue &ldquo;Protagoras&rdquo; that in everyday life everyone both wise and foolish seek out advice of the expert or specialist, not the ignorant many.&nbsp;The ignorant many are not going to cure you of illness, but the medical specialist will.&nbsp;The same goes for politics.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It is precisely for these reasons that the founders made this country a Republic government, and not a democracy.&nbsp;<a name=""P14""></a>In fact, the word democracy does not even appear in our declaration of Independence, nor our constitution.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;Moreover, Senator Ron Paul wrote in one of his essays that freedom is the absence of government coercion.&nbsp;It is evident that our founding fathers shared the same sentiment since the government they created was the least coercive, with a limited and decentralized government.&nbsp;Their main responsibility was to provide national defense while the states protected individuals from crime and fraud.&nbsp;Paul wrote in his essay that in this way, the government was created to protect the rights, liberties, and property of citizens while government coercion was forbidden by the Bill of Rights and the doctrine of strictly enumerated powers.&nbsp;However, as time passed since our founding fathers, their envisioned republic has evolved into that which they may have not wanted.&nbsp;It has turned into a big government that penetrates a great amount of our lives while abusing the words democracy and freedom over, and over. &nbsp;The conundrum of this is that the bigger the government gets the smaller freedom becomes.</p><p>Another idea that you hear media and government throw around is this notion of exporting democracy.&nbsp;It is absurd.&nbsp;Alongside the absurdity rests the fact that United States technically is not a democracy, but a Republic.&nbsp;How can we claim to export that which we can&rsquo;t be sure we ourselves have?&nbsp;To export a final product you must be able to define it, to characterize it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In fact, it seems like the exportation of democracy has become an excuse.&nbsp;I do not believe there is credibility in the United States&rsquo; intentions to impose democracy in other countries, but rather, I see it as a veil to justify our foreign intervention.&nbsp;This can be seen in many instances where the U.S. has backed dictatorships instead of democratically elected governments, example being U.S. policy supporting an overthrow of democratically elected Hugo Chavez because of disagreement of his economic policies.&nbsp;The list is great of the many friendships the U.S. holds that contradicts the notion of spreading democracy.&nbsp;</p><p>To further extend on exporting Democracy is the situation familiar in Iraq.&nbsp;In order for Iraq to truly have a democratic election/experience, it must be done without U.S. interference and puppet candidates.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is here that I agree with Senator Ron Paul when he says that if the government insists on democracy in Iraq, then it ought to be prepared to accept whatever the democratically-elected government is no matter their attitudes toward the U.S.&nbsp;As Senator Ron Paul wrote in one of his essays, &ldquo;The real test is not whether Iraq adopts a democratic, pro-western government, but rather whether ordinary Iraqis can lead their personal, religious, social, and business lives without interference from government.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>"

I&nbsp;have disposed my old ways of meat consuming.&nbsp; I will not spend a single dollar on packaged meat that comes from industrial factories/slaughterhouses that are not from free ranged animals.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Ever again.&nbsp; <br /><div style=""text-align: center"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center""><a href=""http://www.themeatrix.com/"">http://www.themeatrix.com/</a><br /><br />Kinda funny, and kinda not.&nbsp; Its an animation, but the animation conveys something very real.<br />&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left"">I would youtube the video I saw in my environmental biology class.. but will not.&nbsp; It absolutely traumatized me.&nbsp; It made me cry and want to throw up every single piece of cheap manafactured&nbsp;meat I've ever eaten.&nbsp; It broke my heart.&nbsp; So meatrix will have to suffice.<br /><br />Those factories will never get a single dollar from me for their meat.&nbsp; This includes eggs and milk as well.&nbsp; Yes, I am going organic (free ranged) animal products.&nbsp; I&nbsp;also am aware that organic meat is highly expensive but thats just something I will have to deal with.&nbsp; Its healthier, and atleast I won't be eating it with a guilty conscience knowing what I know now of those hellish industrial slaughterhouses.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm also lowering my consumption of meat.. because I've learned that the amount of meat this country eats is abnormal.&nbsp; The consumption of this much animal protein is pretty bad for your health.&nbsp; So there you go.&nbsp; Another change I'm embracing in my life.<br /><br />It doesn't just stop with meat though.&nbsp; I am including fruits/vegetables as well.&nbsp; Organic to those as well.&nbsp; Pesticides/herbicides are not only bad for you, but they produce new pests that are resistent to these chemicals thus really makes me question the safety of them in general, to my body.&nbsp; But also, pesticides and all these horrible chemicals are just plain awful because.. what is going on is these industrial agriculture farms that are totally dependent on chemicals are killing their soil.. and thus are buying out small time farmers lands to expand.&nbsp; It's really sad.&nbsp; And illogical.&nbsp; Why not fix the solution and rid of the chemicals instead of finding more land to ruin till we have none left.&nbsp; Sure it's more work but this work is a skill we don't want to lose.&nbsp; <br /><br />Organic farmers see the importance of knowing how to preserve the soil, and renew it.. not destroy it.&nbsp; I mean, without soil and fertile land we have nothing to get our resource/food from.&nbsp; I dont know about anyone else but hell yes I&nbsp;want to preserve the things that are gonna keep me alive!&nbsp; So, my money is going to go towards the hardworking organic farmers!<br /><br />What's cool is I found this organic fruits/vegetables market in the city which has affordable prices and daily specials, just like your local jewel.&nbsp; Except with much better quality products.&nbsp; Screw whole foods.&nbsp; I'll go to this place.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&nbsp;just wish I&nbsp;had known this information in this detail and visual before.&nbsp; Because then, I could have changed my ways way before, when I&nbsp;had money and get used to living and eating this way.&nbsp;</div>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: smaller""><br /><span style=""font-size: larger"">Some insight of the day, this is what i had to write my paper on.. well.. part of the question.&nbsp; I intend on writing a book on foreign policy once I get my degrees and credentials:</span><br /></span><br />Mahmood Mamdani wrote in his book, &quot;Good Muslim, Bad Muslim,&quot; that the roots of terror can be seen from the practice of regional proxy wars by the two Great Powers of the Cold War Era: the Soviet Union and the United States.&nbsp; Within these proxy wars arose a military strategy called counterinsurgency which evolved into Low-Intensity Conflict which is the soft government term for terrorism.&nbsp; I will add, this military strategy was created by the military through their observation of counterinsurgency and guerilla warfare.&nbsp; It is this military strategy that was then applied to radical Islamists during their training by the CIA and ISI of Pakistan.&nbsp; <br /><div style=""text-align: center""><em><br />Official United States army Field Manual: </em><a href=""http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB63/doc4.pdf""><em>http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB63/doc4.pdf</em></a><em>.<br /></em></div><br />Returning to Mamdani's thesis, he highlights the evolution of these tactics in three specific stages:&nbsp; First experimentation with proxy wars and counterinsurgency began in South Africa; it was taken further in Central America, and fully applied to Afghanistan when the Soviet's invaded.&nbsp; Mamdani provides evidence, which can be found on many places since its public information now, that CIA chief William J. Casey orchestrated support&nbsp;for terrorism and proterrorist&nbsp;movements in these regions&nbsp;through third or fourth parties,&nbsp;&quot;harvesting and cultivating terrorists against&nbsp;Guerillas that seemed to be Pro-Soviet&quot; (Mamdani, 87).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />In south Africa the proxy war was applied to a anti-communist movement by the name of Renamo in Mozambique&nbsp;and Unita in Angola.&nbsp; This movement began right as&nbsp;the countries gained independence.&nbsp; Both movements were&nbsp;mostly covertly supported due to the high&nbsp;public cost&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the nature of these movements.&nbsp; Renamo was responsible for 95 percent of civilian abuse and&nbsp;murder of about 10,000 civilians.&nbsp; Unita was documented to have had strategies of starving civilians in government-held areas through direct attacks, kidnappings, and land mines set in peasant walking paths.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mamdani writes, the very point of terrorism: to target civilians, was born from this.&nbsp; Implemented as a military strategy.&nbsp; Because in guerilla warfare, the insurgents are un-distinguishable from civilians.&nbsp; Mamdani emphasizes that these insurgents became fish in water.&nbsp; Water being the civilians.&nbsp; The point of right-wing terrorists was to drain their water, these civilians they hid in, and isolate and eliminate the insurgents.&nbsp; This is when the military named this as Low Intensity Conflict.&nbsp; And the&nbsp;Renamo and Unita rebels that were being trained by the CIA thus began learning specific strategies of Low Intensity Confict.&nbsp; Different techniques of performing isolated Low Intensity Conflict&nbsp;attacks.&nbsp; As the official field manual&nbsp;shows.&nbsp; Low Intensity Conflict became formalized&nbsp;in 1985-1986. Furthermore, its application was documented to occur in the Third World.<br /><br />And the next area to be&nbsp;part of this tactic was Nicaragua in Central America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aid was given to&nbsp;groups called the Contras, who were against the socialist&nbsp;supporters there.&nbsp; President Ronald Reagan authorized $19.5 million to the CIA enabling them to create paramilitary commando squads out of which contra safes, training centers and base camps were set up along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.&nbsp;Aid to Nicaragua was given to a despised military resistance and was openly seen as a creation of the United States.&nbsp;Within a matter of months the Contra established brutality and cruelty, blowing up bridges, killing and torturing prisoners, and having a civilian death count of 3652, 4032 wounded, and 5232 kidnapped to make recruits out of hostages.&nbsp; Even after the socialist groups were defeated and stability was attempted to be brought in the area.. Arturo Cruz, on of the leaders of the Contras&nbsp;said the Contras could never lead the country as a democracy because they were a puppet of the US government, controlled by the United States.<br /><div><div id=""ftn3""><p><font size=""2"">But the area where this military strategy was really applied to it's fulles was Afghanistan.&nbsp; </font></p><p>A purpose of the Afghan war was to give Soviet Union its own Vietnam after they invaded Afghanistan.&nbsp;However, plans for Afghanistan had begun before the Soviet Union even invaded.&nbsp;Both the CIA and the Pakistan&rsquo;s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) shared the objective to provide weapons to the mujahideen and recruit radically anti-Communist Islamists to fight the Soviets. These radical recruits would train in ISI-run training camps in Pakistan where they were ideologically influenced with holy war and trained with guerilla tactics.&nbsp; Jihad is a very controversial word nowadays, but during this era the CIA&nbsp;took complete advantage of its ambiguity and turned it into something it is not.&nbsp; Historically wise, Jihad means simply struggle.&nbsp; And in the past,&nbsp;Muslims took up arms in defense as a struggle to protect a threat to their land or their religion.&nbsp; Jihad never meant waging a holy war.&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;<br /><br />Consequently, these radical recruits came from all over the world.&nbsp;In 1985, the Afghan war became an American Afghan war when Reagan authorized stepped up covert military aid to the mujahideen, thus CIA chief William Casey began steps to convince congress to provide American-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles and American advisers.&nbsp;Furthermore, Mamdani notes that the blueprint for the Afghan jihad was worked on by the CIA with aid of the ISI, with CIA acquiring weapons and guerilla warfare specialists while ISI transported weapons and supervised the training. In addition, the CIA with the Pakistani military intelligence provided covert military, training and direction to the Afghan rebels and the US sponsored the creation of an extremist religious ideology that distorted teachings of Islam.&nbsp;Thus Afghanistan became the ideological battleground, on which an international war was fought among the respective regional proxies in the name of an ideology that veiled the true intentions of expansionism and interests of these great powers.&nbsp;The lessons of counterinsurgency and Low Intensity Conflict of prior proxy wars was thus fully practiced on the battleground of Afghanistan.<br /><br /><br />Sources: <br />Mahmood Mamdani, <i>Good Muslim, Bad Muslim, (</i>New York, Three Leaves Press, 2004)<br />James M.

"event","So the class that I'm truly getting&nbsp;experience out of this semester is my Modern Middle&nbsp;Eastern class.&nbsp; Not only is it rich and interesting, but it is quite insightful.&nbsp; Because I'm so much more educated about&nbsp;the culture that&nbsp;is so prevalent in the news and yet, not many know of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And I will say my whole perception on Islam and the Muslim culture changed ever so much.&nbsp; In retrospect, my whole perception of the West towards the Muslim culture changed in certain&nbsp;degrees as well.&nbsp; Islam&nbsp;has a beautiful history which when I'm more awake&nbsp;will blog about.

One&nbsp;thing I will say.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biggest misconception people&nbsp; have about&nbsp;Islam is that its&nbsp;precivilized.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in reality, it is quite civilized.. and the only reason it hasn't had a chance&nbsp;to modernize is because foreign hands.. throughout history ... never let it develop truly into the Islam it could have.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even deeper, the foreign Imperial powers in certain moments of history&nbsp; actually intentionally made sure that development in the Arabic empires were halted... but I'll share those another time. 

However, Islam has a strong identity and had it not been tampered with by the penetration of the Imperial great powers ... I feel..&nbsp;could very well have modernized in a very beautiful&nbsp;Islamic&nbsp;fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, I&nbsp;need to sleep&nbsp;but I will blog more about what I&nbsp;have learned thus&nbsp;far of&nbsp;Islam later.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"

So there I&nbsp;was, at this thing called the rocks.&nbsp; Well, we always referred to it as the rocks but really the rocks were the harbor near lake Michigan.&nbsp; Our partying moved from harbor to harbor as we got kicked from one to the next.&nbsp; I cannot emphasize enough the amount of drugs that the beautiful rocks have ever seen.&nbsp; 

So there I was, my&nbsp;second time here.&nbsp; Party all night and then come here.&nbsp; That's how this worked, and so it went for a year.&nbsp; Maybe more, or less, who can tell when time was not here.&nbsp; I don't even remember who I&nbsp;went there with, maybe it was Megan maybe this is where I&nbsp;had met my Fozzie dear.&nbsp; What I do remember is sitting beside a crowd of people, still feeling the drugs of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence from all except from the dancing of the waves at&nbsp;4 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;All was dead around except for their sound.&nbsp; Not that much later till I&nbsp;saw the peek of&nbsp;a&nbsp;faded orange from the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Let me digress,&nbsp;and try not to glamorize.&nbsp; But in this moment my soul began to transform.&nbsp; I went from frightened and weak&nbsp;to someone who can speak.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was&nbsp;able to shake some hands and right away make friends rather than&nbsp;always be locked&nbsp;within my shell.&nbsp; I mean it when I&nbsp;say&nbsp;I don't hold too many regrets.&nbsp; And as much as this&nbsp;moment of my demise&nbsp;let so many&nbsp;opportunities slip by, I&nbsp;needed this to be who I&nbsp;am.&nbsp; I&nbsp;never&nbsp;lost the social butterfly&nbsp;I had learned to be then.&nbsp; And more, the lessons I impart from then will&nbsp;always be inside now.&nbsp; The truth is drugs made me submit to my fears and forget.&nbsp; And not just that, drugs opened doors to my soul that well.. will never close now.&nbsp; I will explain another time.&nbsp; Let me revisit the moment of that sunrise.&nbsp; 

A bunch of strangers sitting so close to each other all observing the most&nbsp;beautiful ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the minutes&nbsp;passed us by more colors began to fly - reds, oranges, yellows&nbsp;absorbing the dark sky.&nbsp; The cold reminding us just how much we are alive.&nbsp; In that moment, I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted to do nothing more but cry.&nbsp; The meaning of life right before my eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of life!&nbsp; Yes, right before my eyes.&nbsp; It's too bad it took me up until now to realize what I felt and didnt understand then.&nbsp; 

And then the sky turned bright and more&nbsp;kids had come along with&nbsp;them a ton of bads.&nbsp;&nbsp;A menu of&nbsp;things that&nbsp;included lots of&nbsp;things&nbsp;beginning with &nbsp;A,&nbsp;C, E, H&nbsp;and M.&nbsp; Over the years, the big K&nbsp;too had made its way.&nbsp; But those stories will&nbsp;have to come another time.

Im gonna start dating these by years)<br /><strong><br />1998 or 1999</strong><br /><br />So there I was, at my second Rave.&nbsp; All the few weeks I've been craving to be back.&nbsp; I missed the hugs and no fear, the welcoming eyes and the sense that I was free.&nbsp; Yes, at a Rave it was like a lovefest.&nbsp; Complete strangers would come up and give you a hug and tell you to dance like you have no cares.&nbsp; <br /><br />And boy, did I&nbsp;have cares at this time in my life.&nbsp; It was here that my past was catching up. &nbsp;Not only did I always feel so alone, but the memories of nightmares of my childhood were more than I can take and I was always falling apart.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; Just falling apart.&nbsp; Not even my faraway friend was able to hold the string that was holding me up.&nbsp; But now that I&nbsp;look back, both of us were falling apart.&nbsp; It's hard to remember, but it must have been during this time that even him and I&nbsp;had drifted apart.&nbsp; But let's not shift gears and keep telling the story of the beginning of my darkest days.&nbsp; My faraway friend is a whole other tale on its own.&nbsp; <br /><br />You see!&nbsp; Even in a story you do not wish to really tell do you find ways to digress and hesitate.&nbsp; So once Again!&nbsp; There I&nbsp;was.&nbsp; The pounding beats, flashing lights, and the real cool kids.&nbsp; Smiles and rainbows in their eyes.&nbsp; Dancing their lives away in this place called the rainbow roller ring.&nbsp; But as you will see, the innocence of a skating roller ring is the last thing to be found here.&nbsp; The rooms had nothing in them except a dj booth, hundreds of dancing people of all ages, and blue purple red and white flashing strobe lights. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />I&nbsp;had come with a girl I&nbsp;met at the first rave I went.&nbsp; Her name was Meagan but at the time she had a pet name.&nbsp; She was very tall and thin and ultra nice.&nbsp; I mean, when she picked me up she gave me a hug as if she was my very best friend.&nbsp; She introduced me to a countless number of kids.&nbsp; We wandered around for an hour or so, well, at a rave you wander around quite a bit.&nbsp; You wander around to find someone, to find the right beat, to find the right spot, or just to walk the drugs away while your brain is getting beat.&nbsp; But more of that as this tale will progress. &nbsp; <br /><br />After wandering and dancing I&nbsp;began to sweat as the heat seemed to go up more than a notch.&nbsp; So Meagan motioned for me to follow her out.&nbsp; The pounding beats faded into the background.&nbsp; The foreground was of blurred out chatter from the kids around.&nbsp; We took a place upon the ground and she asked if I was having fun.&nbsp; I&nbsp;said yes I&nbsp;love this place and thanked her once again for letting me come.&nbsp; She smiled and hugged me real tight and put a pill inside my hand, and smiled.&nbsp; Rainbows in her eyes.&nbsp; Now, I was not dumb.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can tell from how her eyes were dilated just what she was on.&nbsp; Oh yes.. those rainbows in her eyes.&nbsp; The same rainbows in the form of a pill in the palm of my hand now.&nbsp; She nudged a bottle of water to help me swallow it down.&nbsp; I hesitated, and breathed and said oh why the hell not.&nbsp; So, thus my journey down the magic wonderland had begun. &nbsp; <br /><br />It took about an hour to feel a god damn thing.&nbsp; Prior to that people kept nudging and asking, &quot;Is it kicking in?&quot;&nbsp; And as the hour passed oh boy did I fade out and the rainbows must have been in my own eyes because I was on such a thick cloud.&nbsp; The emptiness I&nbsp;felt was gone.&nbsp; The unhappiness I felt was replaced by an uncontrollably sense of exaggerated bliss.&nbsp; My past erased, my new friends sat right before my new found eyes.&nbsp; With smiles on their faces they hugged and rubbed me and said, &quot;Look its kicking in!&quot;&nbsp; They too faded in and out as the dark slowly went away and was replaced by this blinding light.&nbsp; And thus began the day my life began to truly fall apart. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />At some point in the night Meagan whispered into my ear and said, &quot;I could tell this is your first time.&nbsp; I'll be here by your side to care for you the whole night.&quot; And thus she did, I guess, the body grows a tolerance to this.&nbsp; At first the experience is almost impossible to control with your own will but in time you get a grip of it.&nbsp; But it's time I&nbsp;move on to another period of my life and not visit this one for awhile. &nbsp;<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;"

"event","<br /><strong>&nbsp;2002?&nbsp;</strong> (A guess - dont remember.)<br /><br />There was once a guy I&nbsp;really liked.&nbsp; The first guy I ever wanted just so much.&nbsp; The first guy I&nbsp;wasn't afraid to touch.&nbsp; Well, I&nbsp;don't mean touch in the physical sense oh dear god.&nbsp; I've always loved to touch. How can anyone not?&nbsp; In this story, I&nbsp;mean touch in an emotional sense.&nbsp; The first guy, I finally opened up to so much. <br /><br />But before I keep going on, a bit of background needs to be touched on.&nbsp; In life, there are people who fear nothing much, while there are those that fear everything they touch.&nbsp; I've broken so many hearts with my fear of getting close.&nbsp; Date a few weeks and then never call or see them again.&nbsp; I guess you can say I&nbsp;let them have a taste of what I was and could be and ran.&nbsp; But details will come later on.&nbsp; Let's get back while this guy is still fresh on my mind.<br /><br />One chilly winter's day, I&nbsp;was taking my routine subway route.&nbsp; Well, with no destination in the foreground.&nbsp; Sometimes I'd go on the subway to the city just to people watch.&nbsp; I'd sit there and stare at all the faces and their character air.&nbsp;&nbsp; And listen to their bizarre conversations.&nbsp; Or in some, their faces told more then words could ever tell.&nbsp; I'd sit with my journal and pen in hand and write all the details I've just witnessed and felt.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, on that one chilly winter's day on my way home, I felt someone's stare.&nbsp; He sat across from me, oh god a handsome thing indeed.&nbsp; I held his blue eyed gaze, letting it known that I&nbsp;caught his eyes.&nbsp; As if just caught in some evil crime his eyes quickly darted down to some book in his hand.&nbsp; So I played his little game and pretended to move on.&nbsp; Until, that blue-eyed gaze was upon me once more and I&nbsp;held it but this time with a warm smile.&nbsp; Nervously, he smiled back and went back to his book.&nbsp; I liked this game and so we played some more for a few more subway stops. &nbsp;A cute little dance with both our eyes.&nbsp; Ironically it looked like we both had the same final destinations.&nbsp; The game was fun but nervousness overtook us both as there we were standing inches apart, even closer our eyes could look.&nbsp; And it was greater than any distracting book.<br /><br />We both stepped onto the platform trying to act somewhat cool.&nbsp; And yet, the goofy grins on both our faces revealed we both felt so uncool.&nbsp; I&nbsp;picked up the pace and hugged myself as the chill bit through my uncovered face.&nbsp; Not a minute later did I feel a tapping on my back.&nbsp; His bright blue eyes and a grin greeted me back.&nbsp; I saw his soul, his eyes a map.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />His voice was even sweeter as he said his hello's and said he was so taken aback by the glow&nbsp; and blue of my eyes.&nbsp; And even more, by the smile on my face and it would do him honor just to get my name.&nbsp; And thus we exchanged our names and even phone numbers.&nbsp; We saw each other for a few beautiful months.&nbsp; I adored this guy so much.<br /><br />We used to take long walks during the middle of the night in the empty downtown streets with the wind flowing through our skin.&nbsp; It is here that I learned that the city does indeed sleep.&nbsp; No flashy lights like Time's Square in NY.&nbsp; Only the cold wind dancing near. &nbsp; When cold, he'd hold me so near.&nbsp; Gaze into my eyes.&nbsp; Kiss my lips and tell me how they are so sweet.&nbsp; He used to hold my hand and whisper things into my ears.&nbsp; We used to sit on cold cement, his head rested on my shoulder as we talked of life and zen.&nbsp; He told me of his times with the buddist monks and how they pointed the peace within his soul.&nbsp; And one day, in his house, he grabbed his guitar and played me a acoustic song.&nbsp; <br /><br />But like all beautiful dreams they simply never last.&nbsp; If I ever believed in Karma, this man was my Karma and rightfully just.&nbsp; For all the hearts I've broken from my fear because I chose to run without ever trying to get near.&nbsp; The man I finally wanted so much ran from me twice.&nbsp; Like me, he had a fear of commitment.&nbsp; But not just that, he said, I was the type you dont just let slip away.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ran into him a few years back. &nbsp; Ironically, at the same subway we chicagoans call the L.&nbsp; He said his apologies and gave me a long overdue hug and told me I scared him so much.&nbsp; Because I was so smart and so beautiful and the type of person you'd be crazy not to commit to.&nbsp; He got scared, just like I&nbsp;used to.&nbsp; And ran.&nbsp; Twice.&nbsp; Yes twice because the first time I&nbsp;had taken him back.&nbsp; <br /><br />We both had partners the day fate brought our paths together.&nbsp; But he said I never ceased to leave his mind despite the years.&nbsp; His words gave me closure, he asked if we could speak again I&nbsp;said yes.&nbsp; But never called him back.<br /><br />But my dear Ryan I will always remember him much.&nbsp; Such a sweet period, he gave me the time of my life.&nbsp; A taste of what I could become.&nbsp; And that's when the cold wall I've had around me for men had begun to chip and bend.&nbsp; I&nbsp;look back at this and realize it's like a scene from a good movie and yet.. this was no movie and I tell no lies.&nbsp; This is exactly how it happened, just another memory I&nbsp;hold in my heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;

"event","Hmm.. this sudden outburst to storytell events of my past.. is not.. me dwelling on anything.&nbsp; Rather, I've recently had a turn of events that made me realize just how much I've lived.&nbsp; How grateful I&nbsp;am for all those valuable lessons, how I&nbsp;have begun to understand the puzzle that I am. &nbsp;

How much writing is a very big part of who I am.&nbsp; And as an author, it's not just.. things I create that matter.&nbsp; It's my life that matters.&nbsp; Because my experiences as wild and crazy as they have been.. are the greatest inspirations of any story I&nbsp;can ever come to create.&nbsp; Some of my own life stories, are greater than anything I&nbsp;could ever create.&nbsp; They are real.&nbsp; They hold valuable lessons that not just I&nbsp;can apply. &nbsp;

No.&nbsp; This year, I&nbsp;dwell on nothing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think, for once I&nbsp;can say Im finally moving on.&nbsp; I'm just a writer, who needs to make it permanent.&nbsp; Paint exactly what I'm moving on from.

This year ... I am graduating.&nbsp; I'm a mother.&nbsp; And I'm going to the big U.&nbsp; And I have never been more driven.&nbsp; Especially, driven to write.&nbsp; As much as I say I&nbsp;should be farther in life... I've come to realize, just how far I&nbsp;have come. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

This year... I am so confident.&nbsp; I know I am beautiful.&nbsp; So smart.&nbsp; But what's more beautiful, is my journey.&nbsp; The start.&nbsp; How could I not want to write about that?&nbsp;"

I've said my bit on the War for oil.&nbsp; I've also said my bit, I&nbsp;think, about the inaccurate account of bombing of Hiroshima, and Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have not talked about the inaccuracies of the Cold war.. but heh I wont.&nbsp; Might have my head bitten off.&nbsp; That's a topic of taboo as well.&nbsp; Anyway.. vidal is an incredible writer.&nbsp; And I'm almost done with this book.&nbsp; Next on my agenda is another book of his called Building an Imperial nation, or something of the sort.&nbsp; Can't live without my history. &nbsp;

"event","So, I&nbsp;will admit.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have been avoiding the chapter of my darkest days.&nbsp; I get shaken looking back at those times.&nbsp; And in fact, took me a night to find a way to talk about.&nbsp; I cannot glamorize it because there is no glamour in it.&nbsp; Parts of those times I dont even want to remember because.. well they are just so bad.&nbsp; But how can any person be fully whole without truly being able to look back at their lives, fearless and do nothing but simply nod.&nbsp; I acknowledge it.&nbsp; And now, I'm learning from it.&nbsp; Forever.

So alrite! Let's go back, to the beginning.&nbsp; The night I&nbsp;shared that kiss with Lucifer, the night I&nbsp;was taken aback by the long line around the abandoned warehouse.&nbsp; The goofy looking kids, and the electronic music with the constant pounding beats.&nbsp; And let it be known, the first night I did no drugs.&nbsp; The experience alone was enough to be my drug.&nbsp; This party went all night and not once did it ever take a break.&nbsp; Music kept on till the sunlight.&nbsp; And even then, sweat-filled kids with baggy pants kept dancing to the beats.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There were girls and boys, with huge baggy pants that by the night were half wet and filled with mud... hot pink shirts on girls, and rainbow colored beads all over their wrists.&nbsp; In fact I will say I saw boys too, dressed like this.&nbsp; Looking back on it now, I can honestly say the house of Rave was one that bore no judgement on anything.&nbsp; Wether you were gay or straight, ugly or beautiful, shy or not, thin or fat.&nbsp; Noone cared.&nbsp; All they cared about was having fun.&nbsp; Dancing the night away.&nbsp; And, soon enough I learned, to do lots of drugs. 

The house of Rave had its own segment of transformation.&nbsp; As did each and every person there.&nbsp; It's as if the Rave scene was a living thing.&nbsp; Growing and falling, living and breathing.&nbsp; An everchanging culture.&nbsp; And yes, that culture was defined by electronic music but lets not be naive and deny the influence of drugs.&nbsp; I recount in my last days of that scene conversations with people preaching, &quot;It's not only about drugs. &nbsp;It's the music.&nbsp; It should only be about the music&quot; Only to find them secretly sniffing coke in the backroom of the dance floor.&nbsp; Not about drugs you say? 

My theory of the transformation of the scene I&nbsp;always felt was come about via the influence of the type of drugs introduced.&nbsp; In the beginning, there was house and ecstacy and acid.&nbsp; Rainbow kids with rainbows in their eyes.&nbsp; But as time went by, and I cannot tell you how much for recounting 'time' from that era is impossible.&nbsp; Time was dead back then.&nbsp; But, however long has passed a new drug arose.&nbsp; Something called 'K&quot; and more popularity in cocaine.&nbsp; And towards the end, a huge popularity in crystal meth.&nbsp; Not saying these drugs were not around the whole time but merely rose in popularity during different times.&nbsp; What I'm saying is drugs have a different sort of effect and with abuse effect personality.&nbsp; Ecstacy makes you happy and free, loving everbody hell maybe even a tree.&nbsp; But it gets old and after a while grows very hard to recover from.&nbsp; K, or also known as animal tranquilizer found in the office of your veterninarian, had a whole new effect.&nbsp; A sort of .. paralyzing and dimming senses effect.&nbsp; Made the time continuum stop before your eyes.&nbsp; And if you did enough, an out of body experience can come about.&nbsp; Through much usage I&nbsp;noticed it made people so mean and sour.&nbsp; Turned them as I called them back then.. evil.&nbsp; How do you think much of this stuff came to people's hands?&nbsp; An increased breaking into veterninarians had arose.&nbsp; Of which a close friend of mine was put in jail for.&nbsp; And then there was cocaine and heroine.&nbsp; Yea, you can see someone be very mean on that.&nbsp; Especially, once their addictions began to kick in. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

I dont think I can go on.&nbsp; Chapter over, for now.&nbsp; I just.. cannot write about this right now.&nbsp; Maybe its fear of judgement.&nbsp; Maybe its fear of my own judgement.&nbsp; And yet.. the era of those times have so many explanations and lessons of the person I have come to be.&nbsp; Of what I conquered, from my childhood and the past.&nbsp; And the things I still have a hard time about. &nbsp;

Responsibility, I gained from conquering all that.&nbsp; Living life in moderation, like Aristotle spoke about.&nbsp; All these valuable lessons that have come to me, I want to know where their birth came from to me. I don't even know why I&nbsp;want to write about all this, and yet.. this urge like it has to be.&nbsp; 

But I can confidently say I hate these drugs, and wish they were never around.&nbsp; Because as whole as I&nbsp;am now, I put my mind through some hell.&nbsp; More damage has been done.&nbsp; Sure lessons.&nbsp; But at what cost.&nbsp; And now that I've seen the potential of that pandora's box how could I not worry as a mother, knowing how well within reach that box has become. &nbsp;

And then.. I&nbsp;realize.&nbsp; I had no mother or a guiding light.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had noone.&nbsp; Maybe that is the root of where it all begun.&nbsp; Chapter over.

I want to get into my days of light before I&nbsp;dive into my days of dark.&nbsp; And Kristin, was the beginning of many days of light. &nbsp;<br /><br />Our first encounters were all throughout High School through a mutual friend, Nicole.&nbsp; And as much as High School is a big blur, well.. segments of it.&nbsp; I remember me in the beginning of High School;&nbsp; Lack of confidence as an unusual animal outcasted from his or her pack; and social skills that were undeveloped, social skills that were hurt by a broken past.&nbsp; My escapes from the hardship of not quite fitting in were my philosophy books.&nbsp; My only happiness of those times were knowing that I had soulmates - Nietzsche, Socrates, Camus, and so many other great minds.&nbsp; No. I lie.&nbsp; It was at this time also when I&nbsp;had a creative outburst to write.&nbsp; The passion to write has been inside since I was a child, but it was truly born during this era of my life.<br /><br />In fact, I&nbsp;was the sort of girl that would prefer to read, &quot;The trial of Socrates,&quot; or write a prospective short story instead of complete some mindless high school dumb-downed task. &nbsp; As bright as I was, I&nbsp;had no patience to complete my senior year and dropped out.&nbsp; As bright as I&nbsp;was I&nbsp;now will say that was a dumber decision to make than any dumb-downed task ever to have been asked. &nbsp;<br /><br />The blurry moments of my High school time occur during the period of my drug-driven days.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know, I was so young to do so much harm to myself.&nbsp; I can say there was quite a good few years my minds been either on a cloud or trying to recover from that cloud.&nbsp; A nightmare to think back now and remember the days I could barely remember my own last name.&nbsp; Or something as simple as to how to count to ten.&nbsp; But worse... to question wether things in my reality are in fact really there.&nbsp; Trying to escape the mirror of illusions and reality.&nbsp; Days of wondering when I'll escape these bad dreams that instead of merely waking up from them I was enslaved in them.&nbsp; But ... these darkest moments I will tell of next, not now. &nbsp;<br /><br />What matters now is the moment of my light.&nbsp; There are three people in my life that I will say matter more than life itself.&nbsp; My family is indeed more than my life and belong in a whole other realm, but I&nbsp;am speaking of only friends.&nbsp; Aimee, which I will get to another time.&nbsp; Except I will say Aimee holds nothing back and when I&nbsp;went down my dark path she turned her back.&nbsp; I remember hating her for years and only later understood how much hurt I caused her by the things I did.&nbsp; How could anyone truly stand by a loved one's side watching them willfully drown in life.&nbsp; And worse, them pushing your helpful hands aside. &nbsp;<br /><br />But once I said goodbye to those drug driven darkful days, who was there but Kristin with her helpful hands.&nbsp; The moment of our bond began at what other place but the famous Denny's we would be seeing for a many countless days.&nbsp; Words cannot describe the horror it is to try to become clean. &nbsp;<br /><br />It hurts.&nbsp; Physically, emotionally, mentally.&nbsp; The dreamlike days are gone and you are left with nothing but the things you tried to escape.&nbsp; Magnified.&nbsp; Isolated realities of truths.&nbsp; About yourself.&nbsp; About the haunted things of your past.&nbsp; The nights spent crying, the nights spent craving.&nbsp; People with broken pasts have this gaping hole in their souls and go through life struggling to fill it.&nbsp; And boy was it full during my drug filled dream like days.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Well once I came clean it was Kristin who had begun to take two shovels.&nbsp; One for me and one for her.&nbsp; Together, we began to fill that hole.&nbsp; I dont know what hurt more, the empty painful hole or the closeness I&nbsp;had begun to feel for her.&nbsp; Both of which I was never quite used it.&nbsp; Only other person I&nbsp;ever came that close to was Aimee and at the time I met Kristin all I felt was hurt at Aimee's betrayal.&nbsp; Always saying how could a best friend turn their backs.&nbsp; But Kristin slowly began to destroy that wall I&nbsp;built of my distrust.&nbsp; Brick by brick through each laugh we shared at the many countless nights of our Denny's sharing times. <br /><br />And so I return to the first day of our first Denny 's time.&nbsp; My minds a blur as to who intitiated what, since, I barely had a grip on my mind at that time.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;so remember the awckwardness I felt.&nbsp; My first real friend that didnt want to go off somewhere and do some hard drugs.&nbsp; In fact, I can't even remember the conversation we had but I remember, in my futile nervousness I did something clumsily dumb and made her laugh.&nbsp; Contagious, I&nbsp;began to laugh.&nbsp; Apparently, my clumsiness was contagious too and she began to follow suit.&nbsp; And the remainder of the night we did nothing but laugh.&nbsp; Something I&nbsp;hadn't done in months.&nbsp; Our bond was sealed with that. &nbsp;<br /><br />And so I close this chapter for today.&nbsp; Because there are a many more I will share of how Kristin came to not only remove each and every brick of my walls, but guided me in so many ways.&nbsp; Perhaps, so many ways that even now she doesnt even know. &nbsp;<br /><br />Oh but I forgot to mention the third person, who matters more to me than life itself as well!&nbsp; And, of course that is my faraway friend whom I've met in the beginning of my High school days as well."

"event","Friends come and go, but there are those that never go.&nbsp; Friends forever till the end.&nbsp; I've never been good with relationships, be it romantic or friend.&nbsp; I've always had this inner tendency to run from things when things got close.&nbsp; Like a frightened rabbit I tremble and run the moment I felt something strong, a bond; a connection; love; a sort of commitment.&nbsp; I've been running most my life, in fact a part of me inside still does.&nbsp; I've tried to tackle my trust defect and yet it is very hard.&nbsp; The outside world never made it easy.&nbsp; Throughout these chapters of my past I will paint more clarity of that part. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

But there are a few of my friends that stuck around, despite the complicated person I've always been.&nbsp; There's Aimee, the one who holds nothing back.&nbsp; The one, who has always known how to make me laugh.&nbsp; There's Kristin, the one who wouldn't dare let me walk away - she's seen some of my darkest days.&nbsp; And even now that she's married, I know she will be here for me.&nbsp; And she was.&nbsp; And she is.&nbsp; There's many chapters of the segments of our friendship.&nbsp; And in them all, she's always been my guiding light.&nbsp; There's my faraway friend, who knows me more than I know myself.&nbsp; In fact, may know things about me that neither Aimee nor Kristin can ever even begin to understand.&nbsp; Things, that I&nbsp;only now begin to understand.&nbsp; 

But I'm merely skimming through the chapters of my life right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in a little while, I'll begin with where we all began.. my high school years.&nbsp;"

"event","So, Morgan I dont know if you still read this journal.&nbsp; If you do, I'm totally sorry.&nbsp; But you and I&nbsp;had some interesting times in the past.. and I&nbsp;kinda want to try to remember them for the sake of storytelling and well.. growth I guess.&nbsp; So, Fozzie is going to be brought to memory.&nbsp; As well as Tink, heh.&nbsp; The biggest sorrow is that I&nbsp;cannot remember the names of all incredibly many people I've met during my life then. <br /><br />Well, I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;may as well provide a disclosure.&nbsp; Some of you that have known me for years, don't really know my life in detail and the things I've done that I'm not so proud of.&nbsp; So bear no judgement please, we all make mistakes of one kind or another.&nbsp; So, I begin by turning the page to a boy name Lucifer:&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>1998 or 1999</strong><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only few years ago did I find out his real name, John.&nbsp; He will be known as Lucifer, since that is what he went by, and thus my memories of him are attached to that.&nbsp; My beautiful Lucifer.&nbsp; Had I never met him, the catalyst my life endured may have never, ever happened.&nbsp; He inspired me to be so bad and yet made me feel so good about it.&nbsp; He had these powerful light blue eyes, hypnotic in a way.&nbsp; Each time our gaze locked, I always felt this connection - a magnet towards him.&nbsp; Or maybe, it was just his inner satan clutching at my soul, knowing full well I was his slave in so many ways.&nbsp; The name suit him well, Lucifer.&nbsp; And I was young and foolish and felt something called love towards him.&nbsp; To this day, he never knew.&nbsp; I think back now and wonder, was it him that I felt this for or just those foolish eyes.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, even if I met him again I cannot deny that my heart will flutter at the mere sight of him.&nbsp; But now being older, I know he is the type of guy who has that power to crush me.&nbsp; And in fact, I did meet him about 5 years ago and yes my heart did flutter and yes he almost ripped my life apart ... again.&nbsp; But Im getting ahead of the story.<br /><br />Lucifer came into my life when we were mere teenagers hanging out at the mall.&nbsp; Our very first encounter, I&nbsp;a naive and unconfident girl got kicked from the mall for loitering.&nbsp; We all did.&nbsp; And there he was outside with a safety pin in his hand.&nbsp; His black greased up curls, those magnetic blue droopy eyes, his amazing lips, frail body, handsome face.&nbsp; And just like that, he burst my bubble as he stuck the pin into his bottom lip, never taking his eyes off me.&nbsp; He didnt even flinch.&nbsp; Apparently, he just felt like piercing his lip in the parking lot of the mall entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />And this is where our encounter got weird.&nbsp; A small bit of blood on his lip went unnoticed.&nbsp; And as much as I thought he was crazy for doing that so nonchalantly, I was even crazier for what I did next.&nbsp; With my finger I wiped the speck of blood.&nbsp; In that moment he grabbed my hand, never taking his eyes off mine.&nbsp; He licked my finger and said thanks.&nbsp; And yes the moment seemed so strange yet the intimacy of it grabbed me.&nbsp; <br /><br />From then on we had small encounters here and there, during our friends get togethers behind the malls.&nbsp; Days, and nights spent drinking and smoking.&nbsp; Loitering, and laughing.&nbsp; I admit I was a brat.<br /><br />I also remember the many girls he slept with, and the hurt he caused.&nbsp; But those girls were stupid and despite it all they would rather stay with the 'group' rather than let him break their hearts and walk away.&nbsp; Instead, like masochists they took the pain of seeing him with the next one around.&nbsp; Lucifer never got into my pants but we always had this unspoken connection.&nbsp; I know because he was an asshole to so many people, both guys and girls but was so nice and respectful to me.&nbsp; Always.&nbsp; <br /><br />In fact, I remember a moment after our nightly visit to a Denny's.&nbsp; We decided to go book shopping.&nbsp; I've always been a sucker for philosophy and more so Nietzsche when I was a teenanger.&nbsp; So, I went straight to that section as we all disbanded.&nbsp; I remember running into him with Nietzsche in his hand and right then our first talk began.&nbsp; This is where our connection was all along.&nbsp; We were both lovers of wisdom, I&nbsp;in a way a beacon of light and he a beacon of dark.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Our respect for one another heightened.&nbsp; Our connection grew stronger.&nbsp; But now, I&nbsp;realize how we both were terrified of one another.&nbsp; Perhaps, that is why we never let one another get close.&nbsp; He during the times of our teens and I 5 years ago.&nbsp; But I'm skipping ahead again.<br /><br />One day, we were loitering as usual.&nbsp; Only this time we all were pretty bored.&nbsp; I was kind of seeing someone, I think.&nbsp; Relationships at that time were very vague.&nbsp; One moment there was intimacy and another it was gone.&nbsp; That boring day though, was the day my life went wayward down.&nbsp; Here came Lucifer, grabbed my hand and said we are going to a Rave.&nbsp; I remember saying, &quot;What's that?&quot;&nbsp; At times I wish I&nbsp;never learned the answer to what that is. &nbsp;<br /><br />So keep in mind I&nbsp;was extremely shy.&nbsp; My childhood prevented me from being very outgoing and social. Instead, up until I learned what a Rave was I was always very closed, defensive, and spoke to a select few.&nbsp; And so I said alrite and before I&nbsp;knew it I&nbsp;was led into some truck where we were all bunched in.&nbsp; Overcrowded.&nbsp; Dangerous.&nbsp; But fun.&nbsp; Because Lucifer had to sit on all our laps and I remember him trying to sneak a touch at my hand or my leg as he sent me these secret stares.&nbsp; God I&nbsp;remember those stares. &nbsp;<br /><br />And so after all that we ended in the beginning of my demise.&nbsp; An abandoned warehouse with a line of some goofy looking kids and music that was just so loud.&nbsp; Beats overpowering the beating of my own heart.&nbsp; A rave.&nbsp; And yet the music seemed to strip me of everything that I was.&nbsp; The friendliness of these kids made me lose all fear.&nbsp; I&nbsp;let go.&nbsp; And before I&nbsp;get into that.. I will say Lucifer and I did share a kiss that night.&nbsp; Somehow we ran into each other in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Without a word we just stared.&nbsp; I smiled awckwardly and he acknowledged.&nbsp; Before I&nbsp;knew it his lips began to dance with mine.&nbsp; And just like that the moment passed we went our ways and from then on ... went our different paths altogether.&nbsp; I&nbsp;discovered a whole new life and a whole new me.&nbsp; I rarely saw that Lucifer and in fact I think he was with someone at the time.&nbsp; We both got into drugs and a new set of friends.&nbsp; Well, he kept his and I found some new.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />But I'll have to open that chapter of my life another time, as well as what happened 5 years ago with me and Lucifer.&nbsp; When we both ran into each other again.. clean.</lj-cut><br /><br /><br /><br />"

(In this case, Israel.)&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, Israel heavily depends on our help with weaponry, economics, and support.&nbsp; But I think as a people, it is a moral obligation to really observe the situation and really think carefully on which side we are helping, or even get involved.&nbsp; Morally, is it really right to aid an incredibly strong military like Israel bludgeon the Palestenians, not only hurting the government there but brutally hurting the people/children/civilians.&nbsp; Its like a concentration camp there.&nbsp; Just a full thrust violation on human rights.&nbsp; We shouldnt be feeding this violence with our support any more, because I personally feel we just make more enemies this way -- especially in the Middle east.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, we are already in war in Iraq, Afghanistan, so why stand by Israel in this one?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Take no sides on this matter, but atleast, do not step on the stool of being the people that aid in a violation of human rights.&nbsp; Show that moral's are still in place here.<br /><br />Ron Paul says it incredibly well:<br /><br /><lj-embed id=""1""/><br /><br />"

"event","My sweetest dream

Keep me close,
whisper to me
and I will always keep you close,
as long as you can hear me
and I can hear you.

Here we are,
in the beauty of the woods
light bouncing from branch to branch,
as the snow lands gracefully 
on the tips of where the light's been.

Dance with me just a bit longer
as the snow falls between us
take a breathe of air
take a breath of me.

You whisper to me,
to close my eyes
as the graceful white speck
falls on the tip of my nose

I&nbsp;feel your touch, 
upon my cheek
and my body melts into you, 
burning the cold that hugs us both.

I&nbsp;melt into your embrace, 
as our lips dance
both our eyes shine as the sun blinds, 
snow no more the distance between us!

Can we chase each other just a bit more,
like rabbits free and alive, let's hide
but lo I'm not as quick as a rabbit,
not as quick as you are..

And then your body vaporizes into thin air
right before my tear-filled eyes you vanish,
no more rabbits, nor more dances
only snowflakes at the palm of my hands.

it was nothing more but my sweetest dream
your tender touch.. 
the dancing of our lips..
the gaze of your eyes.. 
the warmth of your heart...

nothing more but my sweetest dream,
my dearest rabbit, in these moments I think of you quite a bit.
Since, you're even in my sweetest dream"

"event","It's so beautiful outside... unable to sleep I look out and see the beauty of the moonlight shining its life upon the ever so graceful snow... the snow that paints our grounds white once more.&nbsp; 

God.&nbsp; It's so beautiful.&nbsp; Makes me want to cry, how much something as simple as a snowflake contains the power to stir in me such emotion.&nbsp; Because that snowflake bears so much memory of where I been and where I'm&nbsp; headed.&nbsp; That snowflake contains winters among winters of past that hold so much memory of where I been.&nbsp; 

The love's I held, the people I held.. the love I still remember ... the love's I can't ever dare let go... the days of my unhappiness... the day of my lonely childhood... the day's of my struggles... my many smiles and my many tears ... the days of my ultimate happiness... my broken heart... the same roads ... the roads I still continue to turn too .. my life.


And throughout my journey... one thing is clear.&nbsp; There is a fire within me that burns... that has and always will burn... my passions... my love of being alive.. perhaps the only thing setting me free... knowing... we are never really ever or will ever be free.&nbsp; Perhaps its precisely this fire that is the very thing that entraps me yet...it is my wine... my reason to be... to live... to breathe... to create.&nbsp; 

the world is beautiful outside right now as the ground shines. .."

This was the first year where I did not get in a huge tear-filled argument on thanksgiving.. thank goodness.&nbsp; So I guess, it was an ok thanksgiving.&nbsp; I haven't really update LJ lately because every year the holiday season brings me a small hint of depression.&nbsp; Granted.. this year is a little bit less chaotic in terms of arguing and hurtful words towards one another... yet... this year's holiday season I cant help but feel a sense of emptiness.. unfulfillment ... and a horrible loneliness.&nbsp; Why loneliness? I have no clue.. Im surrounded by people.. 


I'm less free this year... but it's alrite in time I will get my freedom back.&nbsp; So many unfilled things that I have yet to accomplish.&nbsp; In time.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will. 

Man.. the winter blues are coming early this year for me =/.&nbsp; 

One thing I&nbsp;am learning this year.. is just how much I love to laugh.&nbsp; And joke.&nbsp; And.. man laughter makes me feel so good lately.&nbsp; I love that I've been able to laugh and smile a bit more than the previous years.&nbsp; 

So this blog is completely pointless but I&nbsp;havent put a word in my lj in a bit... so obligated to write something.&nbsp; Maybe when the blue inside me settles down I'll write something more meaningful.

"event","<br />So, I've been reading some Kierkegaard lately.&nbsp; And even tho, the only religion I&nbsp;can say I relate to is daoism.. I'm giving Kierkegaard's perspectives a chance.&nbsp; I've always been into existentialism.&nbsp; And hold Nietszche as a soul mate, per se.&nbsp; So, the idea that we live in a world where we as individuals create our own ethics rather than blindly following a system of ethics appeals to me.&nbsp; Each is entitled to their own way of life of course, but for me.. it's more logical to be my own God so to say.&nbsp; Make my own fate.&nbsp; Create meaning out of meaninglessness myself.&nbsp; But more importantly.. man can be ferocious.&nbsp; I live with the virtue of personal responsibility.&nbsp; To be accountable for an action.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiergekaard is a different sort of existentialist.. he's what you call i guess a theist existentialist.<br /><br />So, as I've said in the past, my path to progression is always reevaluating my ideals and my flaws, listening to the critique of others, finding value in it and changing as time blows.&nbsp; Looking back at my past decisions and seeing where I&nbsp;went wrong to help me grow.&nbsp; <br /><br />My spirituality comes not in the form of Church or God.&nbsp; But rather, my spirituality has always come from being connected to nature, and moments of enlightenment.&nbsp; That is what's always been and will be real to me.&nbsp; Hell, even the birth of my daughter was extremely spiritual, and I remember crying at the intensity of&nbsp;having her first moments in my arms.&nbsp; There is beauty in seeing life being born like that... makes you step back and remember just how granted we take life at times.&nbsp; <br /><br />My life isnt so steady right now but... I'm not too much affected by it as I would be.&nbsp; I can easily.. let go now.&nbsp; Of anything and anyone really.&nbsp; I've been in this mindstate where.. I'd even be perfectly fine being alone.&nbsp; The key conflicts going on right now.. I've made sense of.&nbsp; And realize that, given time.. its more detrimental then beneficial.. I can easily let go of it all.&nbsp; Especially, if its a conflict that affects not just myeslf, but someone else.&nbsp; I've also learned that.. the world is so full of wonderful people that can enter your life at any times.&nbsp; But, learned that even they will leave.&nbsp; The key thing is to relish the time we have with them.&nbsp; Everything and everyone has its time, and nothing is immortal.&nbsp; But perhaps the earth, the sun, the air.. will be.&nbsp; The essence of our creation has the power to die, be idle, and be recycled.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why I always find peace sitting on the lump of a wood in the forest, feeling the sun shine down on me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Memory also has a spiritual-ness to me.&nbsp; Because.. memory is something that may fade but never really goes away.&nbsp; The memory of some people in the darkest moments has the power to ... shed some light and warmth.&nbsp; Wether they still remain in my life or not.&nbsp; <br /><br />Well back to Kierkegaard.&nbsp; I find it interesting how he separated life into three phases:&nbsp; The ethical, the esthetic, and the religious.&nbsp; The esthetic is of self gratification - through things such as art, lit, music etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;The ethical, of course, are serving duty to a God, country, or even to just serving duty to mankind.&nbsp; He further divides religious stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;One part&nbsp;falls under the part where man feels guilt before god and the other part is man feeling transcendence before nature.&nbsp; <br /><br />I also admire Kierkegaards focus on the individual.&nbsp; I, like kierkegaard, believe the individual is greater than the mass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'll have to finish my thought on Kierkegaard a bit later, as my lil one is demanding my attention now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ill end this thought with a Kierkegaard quote:&nbsp; <br /><div style=""text-align: center""><em><br /><br /><br /></em><strong><strong><strong><em>&quot;A man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him.&quot;</em></strong></strong></strong></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"

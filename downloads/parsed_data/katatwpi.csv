"event","Recently, I came to the realization that I'm starting to fall behind technology.  Not that anyone can really keep up with it all, but a lot of my generation are doing a pretty darn good job.  My solution was to finally get an RSS reader and get all the latest and greatest from the sites, blogs, etc that I love. I have it all, science, technology, tea (yup, that's right), health, fitness, gadgetry, art, music, blah blah blah.

My new realization?  This amount of newly streaming information always at my fingertips just makes me want to get more.  I'm feeling information overload coming on...maybe in a few weeks.  Anyway, here are a few things I learned about today:

"event","An amusing conversation between myself and my coworker.  This could be straight out of Dilbert, which makes it even funnier, because it is straight out of my life.  I think that validates the legitimacy of Dilbert.  :-)  this is paraphrased...

<b>coworker:</b> we need to cover one day this weekend, talk to Bob when he gets in tomorrow and figure out which day you both want to work.
<b>coworker:</b> also, its supposed to snow friday night into saturday, so I suggest you don't pick saturday as the day.
<b>me:</b> or, we could pick saturday, and then throw our hands up in despair when saturday comes and the weather precludes us from making it into work.
***laughter from crowd in lab***

"event","I am feeling very very very grumpy.  I'm am so incredibly annoyed by this guy at work who won't shut up.  He keeps asking me why things aren't a certain way, as if I hadn't already thought of these things myself.  everything is all crunching, imploding into a ball of aluminum foil packed tightly in my chest.  

There are definitely moments where I feel like I am moments away from becoming a recluse.  I just keep thinking I could just drop everything and disappear.  I honestly don't even know why.  Maybe feeling the weight of so many ""things"" being carried around.  Today I have been listening to the same song, exclusively, on repeat, over and over and over.  Say, by JM.  The lyrics are simple, the vocals are really getting to me emotionally, and I figure if i just play it over and over maybe it'll stick."

"event","I find my blogging inspiration more frequently from reading other blogs.  Specifically, Marks.  So, if you aren't mark reading this right now, go read his blog and be learned.  Today, as I read words about one of the greats, referred to with terms of endearment, Marty, and despite the fact that it was his Marty's day, I can't help but think of my favorite Marty.  My Marty also has a way with words, although not as much exposure.  Because there aren't enough days in a year for everyone to have their own day without sharing, I've decided that MLKJ should share his day with another Marty, or all Martys, and so, I rename it Marty day.  Here are some excerpts.

<i>Every single time I come to this town
It brings out the worst in me
Decadence dries deep in the root of mine eyes
To bring out a thirst in me
Bust in to Burbank and buy a big beef jerky on Barham
Stare into the stockyard
Life in this car out on the road
Can be so easy
Then in the evening time
There's a welcome sight
In my lazy dream
I'm still hoping to find
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me </i>  ~Beast in Me

<i>say cheri cheri won't you dare to
leave a message and your number please
Tie them up all my old fantasies
Put them in a big red bow and send them care of me
I'm taking a chance on the wind
I'm packing all my bags
Taking a mistake I gotta make
then I'm glory bound </i>  ~Glory Bound

<i>Does Satan wear a suit and tie
Or does he work at the Dairy Queen
Does he listen to rock and roll
Does he feed the mean
Singing Hallelujah

What about Jesus
Didn't he do it too?
Hang out with prostitutes
And have a drink or two.
Power of example
My mama said it and I heard
She says one ounce of action
Beats a ton of words.

Singing Hallelujah.
Mama said there would be angels
Mama said there would be sun

Is the devil in Elvis to go where no white man went
Or hiding in Hugh Hefner's body or maybe even Larry Flynt.
Say, hows about the President shielding all them stones
Man if I could find a shield like that I'd run 'round naked
in my glass home.

Sippin' Hallelujah
I think my angel's gone to Vegas
Sippin' Hallelujah
Holding aces in her hand. Hallelujah
As she's singing rock of ages. Hallelujah
On the table at the Sands. Hallelujah</i>  ~Hallelujah

Also, completely separately, I have this urge to move to a large island of ice somewhere very close to the north pole, where door handles turn upward to prevent polar bears from accidentally opening them.  Maybe."

"event","I find myself taking an online training module on EVMS, or Earned Value Management Systems.  On its own, not such a bad thing.  In fact, the concept is quite organized, smart, efficient, etc.  However, this module is just about the dullest thing on the planet.  Ever since college graduation I have missed school.  This module makes me glad that I am not actually in school any longer.  To get credit I have to get 100% on the exam.  The words on these slides appear to me as ink blots and the narration a high pitched dull beep, like that of the emergency broadcast system.  This beep is occasionally interrupted by the mechanical enunciation of an acronym or a MIL standard document number.  I hate acronyms and documents with numbers rather than meaningful names.  Even as I type, my internal dialogue is devolving to a monotone hum consistent with that of the powerpoint narrator's.  I think its' time to go home."

"event","I've read this before, but mark's blog reminded me of it.  Studies have shown that brain scans of people supposedly in love are remarkably similar to those of people with serious mental illnesses such as drug addictions and obsessive compulsive disorder.  Read <a href=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117131067930406235-q7phPWWqsWPHWJXllgmvkZOubXM_20080213.html>here</a> for more on the subject.  I just find that very revealing.  I've called people crazy for doing certain things while in love.  I guess maybe they were.

I seriously need a fun vacation.  I've been thinking about taking a train out west, possibly to seattle for a few days, and then down to oregon by either train or bus for a few days.  It could be a fun little adventure.  Or, maybe i'll just fly out there and save myself the time and money.  I really would enjoy the train ride however.  Like detox from life."

between, throughout
camaraderie?
or is it?
shades of grey
my dear

tell me why we always miss things when they are gone?
that gifted shiny hand blender, which you thought was great, but never used in 5 years... so you get rid of it, and then the next week, you find yourself seriously in need of a hand blender and you wish it were there.  Or the old piece of furniture you thought was so unique. You loved it, you planned on refurbishing it and just never found the time or the courage to sand the first patch, and a month after trashing it, you have this epiphany, and a whole free weekend, and you can't think of anything but that piece and what you could do to make it perfect, if only you had it.  Where it is... what its doing... if it was found and is living with someone else now?  

absence makes the heart grow fonder?  Is this related?

How about the whole ruining friendships adage?  people say friends make the best relationships, but then what about breaking the glass bubble?  the second someone says or does something to change that, either something great happens, or it will never be the same again, and also nothing great.  unless you are both really drunk, then you have an excuse the next day, and everyone can usually forget that anything happened.  I guess that's the way to go.  or, forever hold your peace.  maybe that's the way to go.  Or maybe, i should just stop thinking, leave work and go snowboarding.

I think when feelings about other people are seriously affected by a significant other, its time to reevaluate.  I should have seen/known that a long long long time ago.  Everything can just get so flipped and skewed inside a brain being inundated by chemicals of infatuation.  Or whatever.  All of it affects even those who you think have ""great"" integrity.  Or who think they themselves have great integrity.  We've all seen how the house of cards falls.

<li>1. Alicia and Jason are pretty much the best friends a gal can have.  They have never faltered.  Truly, I think I can say never.  They know me so well that they know what I need.

"event","so, britney spears shaved her head.  good for her.  speculation on whether this is going to hurt her career is irrelevant.  she doesn't need a career.  she has all the money she will ever need.  she has two kids to take care of.  what she needs is a life, some self respect, personal responsibility, and courage.  I don't know why she did it, but I suspect it was for the same reason I do some of the things I do.  I suspect it was to affect some sort of change, some realization, some new state of being that will allow her to figure out happiness again.  or she got gum stuck in her hair...  either way, leave the poor girl alone.  I personally think she's been acting like trailer trash lately, and i don't respect it.  but, that isn't to say that she's a bad person.  everything is cyclic.  everything.  and i'm not about to say it couldn't happen to me.  so britney, good luck.

"event","The basic nature of the human race is not all for one and one for all.  I think selfishness is just instinct.  How can I get mad at instinct?  I don't.  Any of my annoyance (not anger) comes from the lack of honesty and lack of responsibility that people take for themselves and their actions.  Nobody is perfect, and I'm certainly not on some high horse myself, but at least I'll admit to being an asshole at times.  At least I care when I hurt people and will make a genuine effort to make them feel better.  Maybe this is just a disparity in how people (specifically them vs. me) show their feelings, but probably not.  There are times when I don't see that I'm being a dick, but I pray that my true friends will tell me when I am.  I love my friends because they help me, they teach me, they share and learn with me, they experience with me.  I don't want friends who will just agree with me to 'support' me.  I don't consider 'sticking by me' to be the same as agreeing with me.  A friend who sticks by me is a friend who continues to help me grow as a person and doesn't get mad when I try to help them grow.  Sometimes that means telling your friend they are being lame.  Sometimes that means telling your friend they are awesome.  Sometimes that means telling your friend that no matter what they do, or what they say to you, you'll be there to take another hit, catch another tear, and carry them when they can no longer walk.  Sometimes life is complicated, but sometimes life really is this simple.  Sometimes when it works, its a beautiful thing."

the weekend was mostly awesome!

friday night I went out with some college friends for polish food to celebrate Polish Independance Day!  The food at Cafe Polonia was fantastic and the company was great as usual.  

saturday morning I got to spend some time with someone very dear to me.  I had a great time, but it was also heartbreaking as usual.  

saturday night I went to see Outside In play at the Ale House, and got to hang with lots of friends, including an old high school friend, Luko, current buddies Ricky and Heather, Autumn, Lauren (who drove all the way up from RI), roomate Krystal and various band members.  yaay, fun

Sunday I ate yummy pancakes, went to see Borat again (so awesome) and chilled with a bunch of friends at Autumns.  We then went to the new Friendly's in Lawrence to participate in friends and family night where we were served tons of free food!!!!!!!!!!!  That ended the weekend on a good note.  :-)"

"event","so, in thinking about the last line of my last entry, i've decided that my emotional state will be aided by more running.  I always feel better when I am more active, even though I am lazy about getting going.  So, I think I'm going to get back into my old habits of college years.  go to sleep in running clothes, wake up in the morning, put on socks and shoes, go running, take shower, go to work.  This will allow me to run outside in the light (by the time i get home it is pitch black).  Also, I am generally so NOT awake that I forget i'm running for about the first 15 or 20 minutes.  Also, I can do some weight training or cardio when i go to the gym at night a few times a week, instead of running.  Since I'm going out to a show in Waltham tonight though, this will probably start this weekend, or next week.  :)  Here's a poem I wrote years ago.

running away
each step
sounds the same
and a million wouldn't drive me crazy

each step
brings me that much farther
from everything
I can't handle or never wanted to

sounds the same
as my brain
when nothings really right
and all I want is nothing to do

and a million
of these runs won't do
a million times I leave
and always back to here

wouldn't drive me crazy
to not have to run
in so many ways
but always here; I'll always be right here"

Also, my mom always did a great job decorating for thanksgiving and christmas, and kept a lot of neat traditions alive, so I just have a lot of really warm memories.  The past few years the holidays have been hard because a lot of close relatives have passed on, and its hard to not see them when they should be there.  I finally think this year I am more accustomed to them not being around, and I think I've done my coping and my mourning.  I finally think that I can enjoy the holidays again and have great memories of when everyone was around and just be grateful for those times.

I'll throw out a huge one for y'all.  LOVE.  I can't define it, but I feel it.  I've tried to figure it out before, but I don't think I made any progress, and I don't really want to.  I can be content just to feel it, and not define it.  I've heard so many analogies and its all so cliche.  This is starting to remind me of one time I was rock climbing out at Crow Hill and after I rigged up the top rope, I tied in and sat at the edge of the cliff in the early morning and looked out at the landscape.  I've done it before, and its always nice, but nothing beats this day.  The sun, the colors, the smells, the breeze.  So many things came together in that moment to make it right and I'll never be able to explain what I felt.  All I can say is it was good, it was indescribable, and I feel like I wouldn't be doing it any justice to try to find the words, or an analogy that I think fits.  

I think this is why I'm not really a writer.  I guess I just don't want to find the words.  Sometimes, I think they cheapen it all...  I do love to read though, so I'm glad somebody is a writer!  HA"

"event","I don't know how I feel about victims.  My friend Abby got me thinking about this.

I was pissed off at her because she has some stuff of mine.  This stuff was left with her by another friend, and abby lived in my city, so we thought it would be easy for us to get together so I could get the stuff.

Its been over a year now and I still don't have the stuff.  This is because she was in a relationship which she claims was controlling and abusive.  I tried many times to go to her place to get the stuff, but she always said she had no time.  or her boyfriend wouldn't let me.  I just thought she was totally dependant on her boyfriend and was being a shitty friend.

The thing is, I sort of feel that calling yourself 'the victim' is a total cop-out.  Life doesn't happen to you, you make life happen.  I make my experiences what they are.  I chose to be with who I want, and if it turns out bad, I always think it is partially my fault, and that's not me getting down on myself, that's me taking responsibility for myself.  I really fucking hate people who don't take responsibility for themselves.  yes, that guy may have been a dick to my friend, but she chose him, she chose to stay with him, and she chose to ignore her friends because of him.  I beleive there is always a way out, but its all about strength.  There are a lot of things in life that are hard to do, but does that mean you don't do them????  FUCK NO.  

I also have issue with people giving others a guilt trip using the excuse that they are the victim.  So, you were a bitch to me for a long time because you were in a bad relationship, and because I'm pissed about it, you tell me to go to hell?  Because I should be more sensitive that you were in a bad relationship??  You should be more sensitive that I had to deal with you being in a bad relationship.  Yes, I sound like a total douche right now.  I know.  I don't even care.  I really am sympathetic most of the time.  But, I have a sore spot when it comes to relationship trouble.  I just feel very strongly that people in bad relationships should get the fuck out of them and stop wasting everyone else's time.  And stop playing the victim card, and stop saying that they are being manipulated...if you can tell me you are being manipulated, IT ISN'T REALLY MANIPULATION.  It is you being a pussy.  yes you, you know who you are.  WTF

I AM NOT A VICTIM

"event","I consider myself agnostic, and I am at complete peace with that, and here is why:  I don't think it matters if god exists or doesn't.  When I say god, I mean any almighty power/being whatever.  Lets explore this a little.

first off, most people who believe in god believe he/she is an almighty being who created the earth.  here is a better definition:

god (gd)  Pronunciation Key    
n. 
God
1) a.  A being conceived as the perfect, omnipotent, omniscient originator and ruler of the universe, the principal object of faith and worship in monotheistic religions. 
   b.  The force, effect, or a manifestation or aspect of this being. 
2)     A being of supernatural powers or attributes, believed in and worshiped by a people, especially a male deity thought to control some part of nature or reality. 
3)     An image of a supernatural being; an idol. 
4)     One that is worshiped, idealized, or followed: Money was their god. 
5)     A very handsome man. 
6)     A powerful ruler or despot. 

I know this whole blog is a little vague, since there are many different visions of who god is, so lets just go with the christian vision of god, since I was raised catholic.  If you aren't familiar, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity .  I think you'll find that my thought process can be applied to any vision of god though.

also, i'll be simplifying everything to the extreme, just for the sake of time.  feel free to rant about it.

so, essential to god's existence is the idea of heaven and hell.  heaven being the place that you go if you are a good christian person.  how do you get to heaven?  according to wikipedia: 
<quote>'entrance to Heaven is conditional on having lived a ""good life"" (within the terms of the spiritual system. Catholicism and Anglican Christianity states that ""He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved."" These religions also state that someone must repent (turn back) from sin in order to get to heaven.'</quote>

So, If I live a good life, am baptised, believe in god and repent, i'm all set.  So, since god is almighty, he/she must have made up these rules.  This tells me that God won't let anyone in if they don't beleive in him.  I feel like that is pretty spiteful of him.  I thought god was compassionate?  I don't have any respect for a deity that would put out perfectly nice, good people just because they don't believe in him.  Therefore, I refuse to worship said god and don't care if I get into his heaven.  doesn't seem like a cool place anyway if he is the management, so i'll take my chances with the devil.

If you beleive that is not true, that god would let in anyone who was good, regardless of whether they believed or not, then I'm good to go, since I believe i am good, despite my lack of god-worship.

There ends my theory.  If god is truly all-loving and forgiving (the type of god that I would worship) then he doesn't care if I worship him, just that I am a good person, and if so, i'll get into heaven and meet him.  If god is really power-hungry and spiteful and wants everyone to believe in him and worship him, then I wouldn't worship him anyway, cause he sounds like a douche, and I don't want to be hanging out with a douche for all eternity anyway (that's a friggin long time)."

Recently, I decided I need to change, if for no other reason than just to be fresh.  One big part of that was moving.  Another part was some new piercings!  I also want to get my first tattoo very soon.  Those are some very noticeable changes, some physical even, but I have a lot of other things to change too.  I think I need to learn to be a better friend.  I don't mean I'm a bad one now, but maybe I can be sometimes.  I think I need to listen harder, and help more.  I think I need to give more.  I think I need to be thankful more.  

I also think I need to be more free.  I constantly feel the constriction of the civilized world, of corporate BS, and societal norms.  I've never been one to conform too much, but at the same time, I don't think I rebel enough.

I need to slow down and smell the roses.  I want to be outside more, because sometimes I forget about nature, beautiful smells and colors and vibrance.  I am excited for the snowboarding season.  I need to buy a helmet so I can learn some crazy stuff and not be afraid to go faster.  I hope I don't break my neck.  Mark, are you up for some more road trips?

I need to stay stronger.  physically and mentally.  Rugby has helped me keep in shape to some degree, but I still feel like a slug sometimes.  I'm joining a gym in Gardner, and I'm going to have some high school buddies of mine kick my ass into shape, and Autumn is going to come to the gym with me, and we're going to be super hot!

I need to generally take better care of myself, sleep a little more (I said a little, because I think I'll have plenty of time to sleep when I die!) read a little more, eat a little better, love a little more.

I want to love a lot more actually.  Maybe someone can help me with that.

When we finally started hanging out, we became fast friends.  I honestly don't remember everything from the early days because it seems like ages ago now.  He's one of those people I get the feeling that I've known forever.  He's always been the type of person that I could just hang out with and not have to feel like I was entertaining.  We would just listen to music, surf the web, watch movies, talk about life.  We basically spent a ton of time together.  He taught me tons about computers.  He puts up with my crap.  He is one of the only people in the world that I truly trust with my life.  He's one of the only people in the world that I feel like I don't have to hide anything from.  He and I call each other on our bullshit.  There is nothing I don't think I could say to him.  He has always been there for me when I needed it, and I'll always be there for him.  There have been times when we've lost touch, but never really for long, a few months, but it always feel just the same when we get back in touch.  The best thing is, I can always count on him when I need him, and I can always count on him to be honest with me.  If he doesn't want to do something, he'll just say he doesn't feel like it.  No bullshit lies about having other plans or being sick, or whatever.  Also, I can always count on him to tell me when I'm being a complete idiot.  Everyone needs that, but some people are just shy or whatever.  </lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Mark""> Mark got me into this LJ thing.  Mark worked with me in college at the library.  There we had hours of free time to spend chatting about all sorts of horrors (life).  He also went to Thailand with me, and we had a blast.  Mark is basically an awesome road trip buddy.  We went to Thailand (not so much a road trip), he came with me to help move my parents from Florida back up here, he drove with me to Tennessee to see Bonnaroo 2005, he's been snowboarding in Maine with me, he has helped me move (just a sucker for punishment) and the last move was a real doozie (I can't thank you enough Mark!!!)  Incidentally, Mark's LJ is awesome and I greatly enjoy reading all the new posts.  Mark is a great guy, great to drink with, great to play music with (drunk...haha) great to chill with.  He's very chill most of the time, very contemplative.  He and I enjoy an interest in Buddhism and eastern culture.  He's one of the few people from the library that I've kept in touch with after college.  He's also a real trooper, always there in a pinch, and always up for a good time. </lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Autumn"">Autumn is amazing :-)  She was my sister's best friend.  I didn't really know her until my sister died a few years ago, and we ended up doing a lot of things together with regards to all the funeral/mourning badness.  We haven't kept in great touch over the years.  We've both had our mountains to climb and I think a lot of heartache to get over after Hollie's death, but we recently got in touch again and I'm so glad!!  Autumn is a super sweet person, and very real (which you know I like).  She has a heart of gold, and is a great person to talk to.  I have had the best time hanging with her over the past few weeks, despite endless drama with a certain group of mutual friends of ours.  I can't wait for more good times!!! </lj-cut>"

"event","So, I've been thinking a lot about honesty lately.  Its so easy to want to beleive that things are black and white, but that is def not how this world turns.  Honesty is a concept squarely residing in the fuzziest of gray areas, at least in my opinion.  The thing is, raw emotion is completely irrational and uncontrollable.  I like to think that any lies I tell are in the direct interest of keeping someone from some sort of heartache, or (more selfishly) in pursuit of my own best interests (look, sometimes you have to be in it for your own sake).

Many people lie because it makes them feel better about themselves at the moment.  Like lying to people about why you don't want to date them.  Most of the time, I think people just feel like jerks if they give the real (probably ""shallow"") reason why they aren't into it.  Or, people lie to make themselves look better.  I am not a fan of this type of lying.  Its super selfish, and only usually causes more heartache and confusion and with only minimal gains.  Also, I think if you do it long enough, you end up convincing yourself you are someone that you are not.  If you convince yourself that you are better than you are ('better' being a very subjective term) you will never try to better yourself.  

I watched an episode of House the other day with friend.  I've seen the episode before and had many conversations about it.  Basically, its about a lesbian couple.  One is in liver failure (we'll call her amy) and needs an immediate transplant and the other (we'll call her sara) offers to give half of her liver.  The twist is that amy was planning on breaking up with sara before she got sick.  There is an ethical dillema because the doctors are aware of this fact and they don't think that Sara is.  One doctor thinks that amy should tell sara before she goes through with the transplant.  House doesn't think she needs to.  The question is, what would you do?  could you live with yourself if you didn't tell your partner you wanted to break up before they donated an organ to you????  My answer is yes, I could live with myself.  I wouldn't say a word.  Really, you save the other person some heartache.  

<lj-cut text=""Here are the reasons."">A) they must really love you to donate an organ, and very well might still donate it even if they knew you were breaking up.  
B) survival of the fittest, the fact is, your gonna die if you don't get the liver.  why take chances telling them in the off chance that they change their mind?  
C) if you get the transplant and then tell them afterward, they get the good shivalrous feeling that they donate an organ to someone who really needed it.</lj-cut>

Now this is obviously very selfish, but for good reason.  I think the mortality issue really makes the difference when it comes to honesty.  If you or someone else could die as a result of you telling the truth, fuck it, you need to lie.  If its a matter of your own pride, or minimizing your own heartache or discomfort, I think you need to suck it up and tell the truth.  There is nothing like the sting of reality to wake you up from a haze.  Besides, I would rather brutal, bold truth, which usually hurts like hell or churns your stomach to numbing ignorance.  I am one of those who thinks that feeling something, anything, whether it be good feelings or bad feelings, pain, joy, sickening dissapointment or intense euphoria is much better than nothing at all.  

So, those are just a few thoughts.  In general I think my issue with lying to save face, or to ease pain (granted, this seems like a noble pursuit) is that it is so hard to keep a lie enclosed in a nice little bubble, preserved, so that it is untouchable.  Normal course of events involves the person eventually finding out about the lie.  Then there is more heartache than before, usually fighting, feelings of betrayal, etc.  I just think that lying is a lot more work than its worth.  I wish more people realized that.  I also wish a lot more people were well-equiped to handle the truths of life.  Maybe that is the real underlying problem.  Everyones inability to cope.  

Dear everyone, get some fucking balls."

"event","Lately I feel like nobody living nowhere with noone.  I think it mostly comes down to me not having a real home, where my stuff is.  Right now I'm living out of a few boxes at my friend Pete's place in Nashua.  Pete is a sweetheart for letting me crash there, and really easy to live with, and very understanding of the dog situation, etc.  The city of Nashua isn't bad at all, the commute isn't bad, the condo is actually really really nice, but somehow, I hate it.  So weird.  I don't use hate often, but I can really say with all honesty that I hate living there.  I think its because  my friends don't live there.  I have seriously been considering moving back to Gardner, just to regain some normalcy, sort of.  I had wanted to move back to Somerville, but I dont want to drag this out, and it might take longer to find a good reasonably priced place in Somerville.  In gardner, I can find a 2-bedroom for like $700!!!  And, it would be much easier to find a second job in or around gardner if I wanted to take a few nights a week waitressing or something for extra cash.  

I keep going back and forth between wanting to move away and start fresh and wanting desperately to stick around.  There are always opportunities to take assignments abroad, or temporary duty things in the US.  Recently I heard about the Japan one again, and one in Sunnydale, CA.  Both sound like great jobs.  There is always a part of me that just never wants anything to change, I think everyone wants that to some extent.  There are moments in your life you remember as being monumentally fun and you can't help but want that moment forever and people think that if they stay in the same city, or in the same job, that things will just stay that way.  Of course, it never does.  But no mattter where friends move to, etc, the fact remains that home is home, and the only place I truly feel home is in Gardner.

Also, I must post later about lots of other topics.  like honesty, poverty, war, House, friends, lust/emotion/deception, rugby, self esteem, music, and needing help."

"event","...and mark was there for it all.  Although he may have been confused.  Luckily, I think he and Jay are the only people who know this exists.  So I think I'm free to tell the story here.

Last night I was supposed to have rugby, then go to the Burren to see Nate play.  I had been thinking of skipping rugby due to a hand injury anyway.  So I talked to a longtime ""buddy"" (don't pretend you don't know what I mean) of mine and invited him to the burren as well for some live music.  We decided to do dinner as well.  

Went to a really nice italian place for dinner.  Marino's I think.  Ordered a bottle of wine.  started drinking.  My buddy, we'll call him John, seemed distracted, not his usual talkative self.  I find out that the real reason he has had a bad day is that he talked to his ex earlier in the night whom he hadn't talked to in a long time.  long conversation about them, relationships in general, and then about my previuos relationships...and we are still downing this bottle of wine at a decent pace.  topic of getting back together with ex's emerges and I say I never would.  I say I don't think love is enough in some cases.  John tells me I'm cold.  COLD  this bothers me.  after dinner order irish coffees.  yum.  then realize what time it is and head to the burren.  beer.  hung out with caroline and nate, watched nate play, all is good...getting ready to call it a night, when who enters the bar but my ex and his good friend (with whom i've had relations).  So here I am sitting at a table with literally half of the men I have ever slept with in my life.  WORLDS COLLIDE!!!!!  that would have been fine, but my ex sees my friend john and after being introduced says, ""ah, the infamous john.""  nice job being discrete!  then they start talking and john says he thinks my ex is cool.  GREAT  then in my drunkeness i start having a deep convo with my ex.  this is all crazy and bad.  i'm still annoyed that john called me cold.  i'm not cold.  i'm protected.  is it cold to think that love is not enough?  

anyway, we eventually leave because john needs to get home.  stuff happens at my place, john ends up staying.  i set my alarm for 4:30 so he will have time to drive home etc in the morning.  4:30 is so early.  i couldn't sleep because i'm thinking about what ""cold"" means, the dog won't sit still and john is snoring.  suck  WTF mate  and the day ends in a death spiral (and i do mean death spiral) of passion, emotion, confusion and sadness.  I need to learn to play the guitar.  that's all

and to my friend mark, I apologize for involving you in the death spiral.  somehow I didn't see it coming.  I hope you still had a good time.  I owe you a trip out to your neck of the woods.  we should play some instruments and sing.  and get tattoos.  YES"

I either go crazy in this weird sort of limbo, but continue on the path of physical gratification, or chose to turn that down and begin the ending of an era...  sad day.  is there a breaking point?  maybe...am i there yet?  i'm not so sure.  either way though, i suppose i've had my fun, and its got to end sometime.  maybe i'll just make this into a test of mental strength.  yeah, that'll be fun.  I don't understand how other people can drive us crazy like this and I wonder have I ever done this to anyone else before?  I feel sort of bad now, I hope I haven't.  heart breaker, dream maker, love taker...."

and first, some words on my dad.

my daddy loved to take naps
he'd let us share his ZZzzzs
and i've never known a man
so fond of his swiss cheese

my daddy always loved me
i'll say ""i know he tried his best""
never thought i'd ever know
daddy's only human these days

my daddy had a good job
stable day by day
you'd never have convinced me
it could be another way

my daddy said he loved me
i think ""i know he tried his best""
never thought i'd ever know
daddy's only human these days

but my daddy lost his good job
lost and never found again
and my daddy made some choices
he's too ashamed to say

my daddy seemed to love me
i always thought he tried his best
never knew this side of daddy
daddy's only human these days

so sad my daddy's not my daddy
not the daddy i thought i knew
only wish he'd waited longer
to let his colors shine through

i'll always say he loved me
and he didn't try enough
i lost my daddy years ago

""'What if we got it?'  I said, staring out at the otters belly up in the kelp beds, taking the sun.
I don't remember how we answered that, because of course there wasn't any answer.  Merely to pose the question was by way of another shot at magic.  Mention the unmentionable and it will go away, like shining a light around a child's bedroom to shoo the monster.  The great ache we were feeling at that moment was for our stricken friend and we were too ignorant still to evision the medieval tortures that might await him."""

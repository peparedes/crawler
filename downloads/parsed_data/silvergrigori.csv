BBC's Sherlock. Even now, after I've finished watching it MONTHS ago, I still can't forget about it. It's REALLY VERY good, at first I wasn't really into it but after watching the first episode I was hooked. (I won't go into detail anymore, since people are probably saying a lot as to how it's all very good and YES, it really is.)

... My only problem now is the fact that the next Season is STILL so far off... and probably just 3 eps AND with another cliffhanger at the end like this season and I'd have to suffer through all THIS again. ... Oh God... 

Moffat and Gatiss can't be THAT evil... right? ... Right?"

I was scared of the dark for quite a while but not anymore. I kept imagining something scary that might pop out right infront of me and I wouldn't be able to see it.

Like Clowns for example...

... still scared of Clowns though..."

To those who don't know it yet: Ryan Reynolds was also hired by DC to play Hal Jordan for the Green Lantern the Movie. He played Wade Wilson (Deadpool) in the Wolverine Origins and Barakapool (I just can't bring myself to call it Deadpool) and there's going to be a movie with Deadpool too. Yeah they have a bit of a problem now.

Please Ryan Reynolds please make a GOOD Deadpool movie T_T"

Yes. I know we should do something about it, negotiations is STILL going regarding that matter, but I'd like to say I TOLD YOU SO to the other party.

Because I did, I really really did. So don't blame me for the fluffy population explosion.

Since our house is under renovation, some cats have learned how to go up our ceiling. Exhibit A: Wizard, my younger brother's cat, due to some bad influence by his mother Rachel, has learned how to climb up to the beams.

How he manages to get down you ask? Well that's OUR problem and not theirs apparently @_@

""My pamangkin, Kuya Ken's son Matthew, where we took the other half of the business namesake was abducted last night at Festival Mall in Alabang.

Name: Matthew"" Chu-chu"" David Samudio
Age: 3 Years Old, Can barely speak straight.
Address: 16 guyabano st umali rd. summitville subdivision putatan muntinlupa city 1770

He was last seen at Tom's World Arcade in Festival Mall Alabang, around 8pm yesterday July 22, 2008 wearing Green Checkered Polo, Maong pants and Green Mr. Bean Slippers.

When we reviewed the surveillance camera in said mall, there was this chubby impoverished looking girl around 12-13 years old wearing a dirtied pink top with floral design and a reddish jogging pants who summoned my nephew and then whispered something to him, then my pamangkin who is very ""bibo"" readily took her hand as they went out of the said premises.

Guys, I need your help with this, if you know people in the media, police or government agency who might be able to HELP us locate my nephew, I'm begging you, please, please help us. Or at the very least, please pass this message to as many people as possible, who knows where the abductors might have taken him... Matthew is a very sickly kid, he rarely eats unless his yaya feeds him and he was about to have an operation for fluid in his right testis.

If there are any news or lead that can locate my nephew, please help us... Sobrang kawawa ang pamangkin ko, who knows how they are treating him...I dont want this thing happening to any kid so please help my nephew. PLEASE. You can contact my brother at 0923-638-4632.

Thank you so much and God Bless you!""

For the record, the first Doctor Who ep I ever watched was with <lj user=""this_quiet""> and it was the New Earth ep with the whole "" Oh! He's slim! And a little bit foxy."" I'd have to agree with Cassandra on that XD and for me the 10th doctor is the best Doctor ever. 9th is a close second though.

PS. 

   Today is Green Day and by Green Day I mean almost everyone I meet is wearing GREEN shirts. *is wearing a white polo and green vest*"

Yes. Remember that game we used to play in High School? The one with the angel with toilet paper wings? ( But really... ._. I had this crush on Tyrael and kept on trying to get him to talk all the time even if I didn't have to)

""Following the announcement of the new Flying-HK-style ""Reaper"" death machines for the British forces (http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/10/the_flying_hk_are_coming_aiee/), the prophetic nature of the Terminator movies has been further confirmed.

Not only will the UK MoD deploy airborne cyber-gunships remarkably similar to those in the films, the flying robot assassins will be controlled by an IT project named ""Skynet"".""

Following up on my Ironman high (Batman is still cooler than Ironman >_> ) I started looking for articles about it and came up with:

<a href=""http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v203/silvergrigori/?action=view&current=LW3.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v203/silvergrigori/LW3.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>

Robot Exoskeletons... oh and that Mecha looking thing from Mech Warrior and Robotcop's enemy XD Yes I know. I keep on stumbling over really weird sites but it's how one learns new things I suppose.

First one, I have to say it really looks like a robot from TV. It's like a prototype for a Mecha. It reminds me of that robot thingy from Robocop, those white things from Star Wars (they were in the part where they were attack the rebel in this snow covered place...) and yes that Mecha from Mech Warrior like so:

The site is here: http://66.196.80.202/babelfish/translate_url_content?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sakakibara-kikai.co.jp%2Fproducts%2Fother%2FLW.htm&lp=ja_en&fr=avbbf-us&.intl=us

Second one is an exoskeleton that sort of enhances your strength sort of like the first robot built by Tony Stark in Ironman the movie except that it doesn't fly and it doesn't have a flame thrower.

"event","LEAF was formed September of 1994 by it's Lead Guitarist Dean Russell and his Cousin Drummer Jay and experienced different line-up changes until now (Long Story...).

Most members of the band are based in Pasig City. With their melodic songs and heavy riffs, LEAF remains true to their sound despite all the current trends surrounding the Music Industry. Influenced with bands such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin and blending them with their own style.

Right now, the band had recorded 6 original songs from their own Monochrome Studios and are currently tracking vocal cuts.

requirements?

 - can carry a tune
 - has his own style especially since this band have their own original songs
 - willing to bond and blend with his bandmates
 - shares the rock and roll dream
 - willing to work from the ground up
 - substance over style
 - loves music

and no I'm not a member, I'm posting it because the guitarist is the one teaching me how to play the guitar ^^"

"event","A funny thing happened to me this morning when I was heading to work.

<lj-cut text=""You see a wile, you thwart. Am I right?"">

It was more or less the typical morning for me, except for the fact that I didn't notice the time and I left home late. (Around 3 minutes late, it's not much but when you live in my house it's already a VERY BIG thing.) So I had to rush my long and grueling walk from the very end of SM North to the other end of Trinoma (Landmark entrance) and realized that I've forgotten my Globe button thingy. Therefore I had to line up (and get pushed around) by the people trying to get their own Fare Card.

That done, I (thankfully) found a seat and started reading the new book I bought: Good Omens. (Yes after going around bookstores and bookstores, I finally found a copy when I was in Trinoma with <lj user=""hiddenpsyche""> last night). After nearly missing my stop I sort of threw myself out of the train (looking harassed because the lady in front of me that took up most space didn't budge even after a whole round of 'Excuse me...! Excuse me please...!'), and headed up the stairs.

And then I saw it.

Someone must've dropped their rosary at the top of the stairs. It was made out of wood and looked like the ones nuns used. I just sort of stared at it while holding onto my book on one hand.

My first thought was: What the hell?

Good Omens still fresh in my mind, I started giggling and picked up the rosary then handed it to the security guard on my way out of the station."

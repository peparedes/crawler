Alright, alright, so it's past Easter. Give us a break. 

Plus, You may or may not have noticed ads on the main page. This is not our doing. In fact, LJ has apparently done away with regular free accounts, and now everyone has a ""plus"" account with has ads. Neither Shauna nor I can control them, so there it is.

A hearty Merry Christmahannakwannzica to all! 

New Eyeshine CD is coming out soon! I'm sure the happiness is abounding! Also, for anyone in the midwest area, Eyeshine is playing at Ohayocon in Columbus, Ohio. (First weekend in January.) I'll be going, Shauna will be going, and The Husband will be going. If anyone is planning on coming, let us know. Maybe we'll bump into each other ^.^

Anyway, here is a combined Christmas and New Year's post. Hopefully this next year will be less busy and stressful then 2007.

So we saw Eyeshine at Youmacon. It was AWESOME! Not only did we get more Bunnyshine material, but we had loads of fun with all of the other great guests. (Especially Tony, the drummer from Lemon Demon. *waves*)(PS- you should all go look up Lemon Demon now. I like them.) 

Yes, school is still eating souls. And I actually ended up going on a strange road trip to Laramie, WY last weekend. (Tim and I are moving there in February for school. They have a llama farm.) 

BTW, this weeks comic is a true story of the car ride to Youmacon this year. I was hit with a case of the squees.

A note on our lateness:

Okay, so we've been slacking lately. Except not. Shauna has some pretty tough classes this semester, and midterms just came and went. Considering she's the artist, it's been a rough month for her. I know we're late. But we appreciate your readership and patience. Eventually, everything will settle down and go back to normal, just as soon as we figure out how to balance everything. 

Seriously though, this week should make up for us being so far behind. I loved doing this one. (btw, I take no responsibility for the accuracy of translations. Babelfish can only go so far, and I only copy and pasted.)

Uhm, yeah, so Shauna kinda dropped off the face of the universe for a short period of time, which I think had to do with school, personal life, and a new job. I was almost going to subject everyone to another round of bunnyshine stick figures, but I got the email just in time. 

So you were all spared from bad artwork.

So Shauna and I have become employed again. And school is starting. And stuff. There wasn't a whole lot of time to do a formal bunnyshine. Laziness abounded. 

Most of you on the forums have seen the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_8xhxrJXbg"">Bee Video</a>. (If you haven't, watch now. Very funny.) Bunnyshine sort of wrote itself after watching that. I mean, how could we just <i>ignore</i> it?!?

I know, I know. We are suddenly in this mode of updating two at a time every two weeks. Still, we are two broke, jobless college students attempting to make our way in life. And it's summer to boot. Perhaps love is in the air? Or perhaps it was the storms that keep randomly knocking out power. (Let me tell you: when my county gets a tornado warning and the news people are telling me that a tornado has touched down in Shauna-ville, bunnyshine is far from my mind.)

Now we present: If Harry Potter crossed with Bunnyshine, and had been written by Shauna and I.

Last week we had storms. Shauna lost power and I lost (nearly) all internet access due to craptastic internet providers. This makes Bunnyshine difficult. Apparently, after getting power back, Shauna lost function of her scanner. (Correct me if I'm wrong) This, also, makes Bunnyshine difficult. 

Well, the product of last week ended up being made, but not colored. So, we thought, ""Heck, lets just update NEXT week with TWO bunnyshines!!"" 

And...instead of updating with two comics, the only defense I have is mental breakdown and anime north this weekend. (Those of you on my friend's list know my hectic schedule. Those not in the know, here is the lowdown: work three 8 hour days a week, two aerobic classes, an improv class, and I will be traveling BY CAR through at least 20 states + Canada in the next month.) (Uhm, and Shauna, what IS the status on Bunnyshine? I got nothing in my email from you today and I just wanna know what is going on.)

In short, I promise we will update eventually. We actually have something of a story arc in mind. And anime conventions always get the good creative juices flowing. We've been updating this comic pretty much weekly since we began in Jan 2006. And we will continue. We've just hit a road glitch.

We thank you for your support. And we thank Eyeshine for tolerating us so well."

We've been semi-lame lately at this game of bunnyshine. We haven't dropped the fandom or anything, nor are we bored of you guys. It's a simple equation:

Shauna finals+ Brittany work+ Brittany birthday+ lack of time for everyone= OMG! 

Seriously, we're sorry we've been lame. We need to get back to our regular six panel format soon.

Due to work, interweb downtime, school, and randomly being pulled over by Birmingham Michigan police today....we're late. 

It's all my fault. Shauna was all ready and on time. I wasn't. 

Anyway, Shauna and I thought of this during Easter. Because of red frosting, we thought of Alex and his ketchup.

Any of you planning on Power Morphicon probably know of the lack of info drama that has been taking its toll on potential attendees. Well, apparently, it's fully going to happen and I will be there. I will be there for a secondary reason (aka cross country trip with the husband) but I will be there at least one day. 

Paulie asked Shauna if he could be a bunny too. So we bring you....PAUL SCHRIER BUNNY!!!

We had some scanner issues earlier this week. Not be able to scan in stuff really doesn't work well with bunnyshine.

With that, I (Brittany) found myself with an upper respiratory infection this week, which inspired this comic.

Wonderful news on our end. (Or at least for me.) I finally upgraded from an outdated computer that hated me, to a brand new laptop with paint shop pro for me to use! (I was previously using Gimp, a free graphic program.) Pro is much more helpful and I'm excited about the fact that Shauna and I can both do some neat graphic editing now!

And, just to let everyone know, we got this idea from a small pet shop by Shauna's house. Rabbits consider grooming a social interaction, and male rabbits groom each other often. Needless to say, this tickled our fancy, especially with the past Matsuricon Eyeshine gay incident. (Just imagine Johnny trying to convince a crowd that they aren't gay. And then getting trapped into saying gay sounding things.)

Anyway, I've babbled enough. Here ya go!

Today is not an original day. Today is copy and paste day. Why? Because it's so cold outside that Shauna's internet froze.

We're not kidding you. First ice storm, now deep freeze. Cold enough to close almost every school district in our part of the state. Cold enough to make my car have psychological issues. Cold enough to gain frostbite in 5 minutes of exposure. 

And someone had enough nerve to tell me today that it's ""only"" going to be in the mid 70's in Florida. They must be suffering down there. 

I'm not bitter.

Anyway, you may be asking, ""Where is Bunnyshine? I <i>need</i> my bunnyshine right now!""

We have some technical difficulties. 

You may have heard of that ice storm that hit the midwest. <lj user=""fujy50""> and I,<lj user=""redlemon"">, both live in Michigan. The ice storm kind of knocked everything off it's rotation. Yesterday, I lost contact with the world because my internet died. Yes, I had power, but it took me over an hour to even think of loading up my email account. I had no way to access my email, my livejournal, or even my school website to see if classes were still going. Since I tend to do the bunnyshine type plus the updating, that was not happening yesterday.

Today, I got a call from <lj user=""fujy50"">. The great powers that be decided to take her power away, which means no electricity AND no water. (She's on a well pump.) We decided that scanning and emailing bunnyshine pictures in the dark is a tad bit difficult. 

Also, as a side note: Bunnyshine will henceforth be updated on Tuesdays due to school and classes. 

So, you can blame the ice storm, but I really don't think there will be a bunnyshine this week. On the plus side, the trees outside my apartment window are nice and shiney, if not looking like they're going to fall on my car any moment now."

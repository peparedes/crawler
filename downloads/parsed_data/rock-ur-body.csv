"event","well me and paul  broke up ... we broke up a while ago but i havent updated so i tell the story... we were at kylies fire and paul got drunk and started being a real big asshole to me and whenever he gets drunk hes such an asshole ... only to me though (its weird) welll so i got so sick of it i broke up with him so me and ryan started ""talking"" and he called me one day and asked me to come over so i did and then we made hot love (just kidding haha) and then he asked me out so i said yes and that was on the 15th of december . LONG TIME SO FAR! lol .. i dont really hang out with anyone except michelle and maggie because everyone went gay on me. When I broke up with paul i was SO out of the picture with paul,jeremy,paul,christina,ali and kylie. The only time i see those people is at kylies on weekends but im too drunk to remember and i dont even talk to them at all. me and maggie talk the whole night and make subway and taco bell and wendy runs lol. well so now me and ryan go out its basically ryan michelle and maggie. because im too cool for everyone.

PAUL IS GAY! well he is about to read this and COMMENT because he likes me sooooooooooooooo much !!"

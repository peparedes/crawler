I started a new job"">&nbsp;So...<br /><br />I started a new job in August. &nbsp;It was suppose to keep me fluid because the job I spent 6 years and $45,000 training for had been less than stable since I started 9 years ago. &nbsp;The last time I had a job outside of teaching would have been when started working at a call centre in June 2004. &nbsp;I lasted a year, working nights and teaching during the day before my body gave out and I was sick for 6 weeks. &nbsp;No word of a lie, I had bronchitis in June! &nbsp;<br /><br />Thing is, I started getting teaching job calls this past week. &nbsp;I worked three days teaching and still worked 21 hours at the part-time job. &nbsp;Doesn't sound so bad right? &nbsp;Well, two of the three days were days I was working at night as well. &nbsp;Thursday I was up at 6:30 to start at 8am. &nbsp;Leave the school at 4pm to be at the night job at 5pm to work until 10:30pm. &nbsp;Get have way home to realise I still have the keys for the lock-up so turn around and take the keys back. &nbsp;In bed as the clock struck 12. &nbsp;(Really, I have a grandfather clock. &nbsp;It really struck 12) &nbsp;Up at 7am to be at the school for 8:30. &nbsp;Teach until 2:30. &nbsp;Drive to night job for 3:30 and work until 10:30. &nbsp;Drive 1/2 way home to realise that it was bitter cold now cause the wind picked up and it had rained. &nbsp;Stop at the Dairy Queen to pick up a friend who would have had to walked home at 11:30 at night it the windy wet bitter cold after she got off work. &nbsp;Drive her home. &nbsp;Chat for an hour. &nbsp;Come home and then crash at 12:50.<br /><br />In the last two days I have gone sugar low 3 times cause my meals are all screwed up. &nbsp;THREE freaking times! &nbsp;Shaking, sweating, confusion, the entire 9 yards of sugar lows cause they are coming on so fast. &nbsp;OK, one time was waking up and wondering why the fuck I was awake after only sleeping for 3 hour and then waking up this morning and congratulating myself cause I didn't over treat the low. &nbsp;But still, THREE freaking times. &nbsp;Since I started working the night job I have been going low an average of once a week. &nbsp;Before I started the job, I was so well managed that I hadn't had a since last &nbsp;March and that was because I was playing and I didn't &nbsp;reduce my insulin before an unplanned scene.<br /><br />Any one reading this will have noticed that I have not said where my night job is. &nbsp;There is a reason for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people do not LIKE the company here in Canada, but that don't have the rep that they do down the states. &nbsp;I work for a company that allows me to come in later than scheduled if I have picked up a teaching job, who will call me on my days off and offer me day work if I haven't been called to teach, who offers me day work on stat holidays because I get double time and it doesn't conflict with teaching, who is making an effort to be a green company and encourages employees to be green, &nbsp;feeds me (OK, not me, but everyone else) junk food every Friday and since I have started has provided me with a steak dinner, a 12 inch sub, cooked breakfast, and pizza. &nbsp;Next week we are getting a pasta dinner. &nbsp;We are paid to do&nbsp;community outreach through the company, have several charities that we support including the IWK and Children's Wish. &nbsp;We have customer&nbsp;appreciation&nbsp;once every 4 weeks. &nbsp;During the heat wave, cus app was snow cones and the last one was popcorn and Jammers. &nbsp;I suggested the next one should be breath mints and wet-wipes. &nbsp;It would be WAY less messy! &nbsp;I was told that that might offend some customers. So, you wanna know what my part-time night job is? &nbsp;I work at WALMART.</lj-cut>"

"event","I drove a car once.  
It was fun, and fast.  
Exhilarating.
I felt alive.

Most everyone I know,
Was driving by 19.
Not me.   
I was a good number of years past that.

I had been in a car before though.
Where others hadn&rsquo;t.
As a passenger.
Several times actually.

The first few times I was young,
Didn&rsquo;t understand (or feel)
The thrill of the speed,
Or the rush of the engine.

The last time I was older,
I felt the engine purr,
But I was not driving
So the speed scared me.

When I finally did drive,
The speed thrilled me so
That I didn&rsquo;t realise 
I never felt the engine.

In the time between
Passenger and driver.
I studied hard
So I could work on cars.

Since that first drive,
I have sat in the drivers seat.
Tuned a few engines.
Shown others the speed.

I see others driving,
Together
And I want to,
Again.

You can drive alone.
The engine will start
And the speed can thrill.
Not as much as when driving with a friend.

I dream of the road.
Wind whipping through my hair.
Engine thrumming
As the speed seeps into my soul.

For there are many roads I could take.
Hot city asphalt, dusty county dirt,
Winding highways, green covered lanes.
Each with its own appeal.



I wrote this in about 10 minutes and then took 10 minutes to tighten it up. &nbsp;When I asked my friends to read it and tell me what they thought it was about most of the answers I got were about driving. &nbsp;I had one person tell me it was about loneliness and another tell me it was about finding a partner. &nbsp;
Of all the people I asked only two where able to look past the surface and that was because I pushed them to do it. &nbsp;Everyone I had read it knew I wrote it. &nbsp;
I mean it is obviously about something else. &nbsp;I said I had been a passenger when others had not. &nbsp;Do you know anyone who's first time in a car is as the driver???? &nbsp;Is sub text so hard to read? &nbsp;Are we a society that relies on having answers hand feed to us? &nbsp;Does anyone know what a simile and a metaphor are any more?"

"event","It has been 3 1/2 years since I last wrote here.&nbsp; I mainly stopped writing cause I moved home and the people I was was trying to keep up with were now close enough to talk to in person.
Those years has seen some changes.&nbsp; I now have 2 nephews and a niece.&nbsp; And we all live in the same province.&nbsp; A good friend passed away from breast cancer.&nbsp; I had a term contract and have been thinking about going for my masters.&nbsp; I have 2 more tattoos.&nbsp; I have developed a new intrest and am involved in a social group.&nbsp; 
Somethings haven't changed.&nbsp; Still prefer girls.&nbsp; Still love fanfiction.&nbsp; Same #$%^&amp; computer.&nbsp; Still can't seem to finish any of my writing projects, unless it is poetry."

"event","Or the lack there of.
They shut the water off yesterday because there was a problem.  Great- school is cancelled for the afternoon.  It's a beautiful day, I sat and enjoyed the sun, and chatted with some other teachers.  Of course because I am on the same line as the school I don't have water at my place.  No problem, right?  It will be fixed in a few hours.
WRONG! The water is still off.  Now I have drinking water because I buy that... but no flushing... no showers... no washing dishes... or hands (damn am glad I have handywipes!)... no washing clothes... there better damn well not be any school!  
On the upside... I can go back to bed as I was up until 2am last night talking with some friends."

"event","Well the internet connection from home is a little iffy so here is a couple updates in one.
My sister is home now.  She got home from hospital yesterday and is drugged to the gills to keep her stomach settled.
I went to an ice fishing tournament on Sunday.  That was an experience soon to be forgotten.  I sat on the freaking ice for 2 hours with no bits.  Then around 4:10 I felt a nibble.  Hauled my line up to see that my minnow had been eaten off my hook.  The next 35 minutes was a sucession of me rebaiting my hook, droping my line, and hauling my empty line back up. 9 TIMES! Then bud, at the hole next to me, hauled in a whopper of a fish. I did get a couple nibbles but my line was mostly dead until the end of the tounament.  So, what did I learn?  I can't fish.  
On Monday I showed my kids a video about AIDS.  It was a good video.  I asked for a written response to the video.  One response was rather interesting. The entire essay used the word eggs instead of AIDS.  ""These poor people had eggs.  I feel so sorry for them.  It isn't their fault they have eggs.  Even a baby can have eggs...""  HEHEHEhehehehe
So I am really sick.  I spent yesterday throwing up.  While I was working.  No way was I going to let a little nausea make me stay home from work.  My students kept telling me to go home but I wouldn't until I saw them all off to home ec/ industrial arts.  them I went home and slept for hours.  I woke this morning still nauseus and achy sore.  So I called in sick to work, and went back to bed. I have now been awake for about 30 minutes and am thinking about bed again.  I HATE BEING SICK!"

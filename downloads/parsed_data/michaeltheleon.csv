"event","Its almost the end of 2004, a few more days til the new year, well this post will be abou events that happen in 2004 but a update about today. Christmas day was pretty cool, I got what I didnt really expect to get. I got a cellfone, computer parts, money and cds. The best part was going to my sister's house and all the family being together. But time for a recap of this year...January was boring! Nothing special happened, but I did go to Disney World for the first time in my life with my cousins. It was cool yet alright, space mountain was the first ride to make me like roller coasters. I liked this girl Ashley at the time, but then I moved away from her back to *courtney*. I've always had my eyes on her since she was in 6th grade, never really knew her though. I gave her random hugs in the hallways at Stilwell. Those Stilwell days are now gone :(. First impressions were that linkin park shirt she always wore, I said to myself ""shes gotta be awesome"" and well.....shes fucking awesome, shes one in a million, no one else could compare to her, shes great...i love her. Febuary, GOOD MONTH...but anyways on to about March. My mom and her sisters went to the Philippines for the entire month, leaving me and my dad here. We were living it up in luxury with a truck and a van. Those cars were the pimpest I've ever rode in and taken care of. April was pretty much a repeat of Januay/Febuary, nothing special happen but going to school the whole month and not missing a day. May was the month, last time I'll ever be at stilwell. Went pretty good up until the last day at stilwell which I didnt go to. It was sad, yet an accomplishment that I finally got out of that shity school. Havent seen most of my friends at stilwell since May....wow. My summer went by pretty fast and it was alright, but not bad, me and my cousin partied a lot. I went to summer school for 3 weeks, it was a good experience, got me ready for high school. My cousin from Washington State came to visit with my little cousin, it was cool. August, school started and it was fun...I met a lot of cool people. September, WAS HELL how many fucking hurricanes did we have? Like 4 hurricanes in a row....ok we had one......again?....fuck i'm tired of it......just pissed!!!!!! I never experienced a hurricane but I got use to the weather...Florida summer life gotta live it up. October was boring, nothing special happened or nothing really happened. November, was a good month. My older cousin (more like brother) from London came and visit us for a month. We went to St.Augustine, Port Canaveral, Orlando and just about the major cities around North and Central Florida. I was planning to go to Miami but no one had enough time off, went to a concert with Courtney...had fun together. DECEMBER!!!!! This month has been fun, I got what I wanted for birthday and christmas...anyways HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE!

Cause theres no one in the world like, Courtney"

I don't know what Im doing today, suppose to go to the mall with courtney and danniella if my sister will take us and then dinner  at longhorn with Haley and family. So far my morning sucks, I'm hungry as I hardly ate anything yesterday, saved some space for today cause I know I'm gonna pig out like craaaaaaaazy. Hopefully Haley comes with me cause I soooo wanna hang out with her, and I wanna hang out with Courtney and Danniella at the mall, perhaps borrowing my uncles huge truck to fit all of us? I'm looking forward to a good day...........

"event","It's 6:29AM and I just woke up, not going to school today at all cause its so fucking boring. All the cool people aren't even at school and all the wankstas are left. Yesterday I passed out from uhhh....nvm at around 6PM and didnt wake up til now. It was kinda fun yesterday though, I skipped 3rd period and went to all the lunches, hung out with my friends Haley and Jackie. Justin came over yesterday after school while I was sleeping and scared the shit outta me, thats pretty much all I did yesterday was sleep cause no one wanted to talk to me, its either I got yelled at for doing something they didnt like or was just online and didn't reply to my IMs or I just simply annoy the hell outta them. Anyways, I got my servers yesterday and now I can start working on my website for the club, tell me what banner I should use from this site. MmMmMmM its 85 degrees in my bedroom. My bday this Sunday so.......


Which banner should I use to put on my site?

Now I got this decent Triniton Sony monitor from my sisters' workplace...Merril Lynch. It cost about only $20...then I went to the computer show and got a nice black computer with neon light tubes and better cooling fans than my previous box...best of all....ITS BLACK!!!!!! w00t to that. And its quiet, thats a plus, before it could literally cut your finger off and hover to California. SUNDAY SUNDAY....sister is coming home from The Swamp, prolly going out for lunch or something of that ordinary. Well, heres a pic of my new computer (enjoi)

"event","Its been a while since I've written in my LJ. A lot has been going on since my last post here. As of today, this is my first one since [Jul. 5th, 2004|09:24 pm]!!!!!!!!! DAYUMMMMMMMM. Well this year has been fun, I had a great summer (and summer school!!) a great beginning of the year at school, met so many cool people. I think since last school year I've changed and matured in some ways. Ok so I'll sum up all the months I missed in 1 post!....So anyways beginning with August, WARPED TOUR was awesome, got a couple of shirts and two CDs. School started off really good for me this year, although I miss last year so much. September was hell!!! How many hurricanes did we have?? Jesus christ! Out of those 4 hurricanes I only lost power for 2 hours or so. And reuniting with one of my bes friends after a month of arguements and drama that seperated our friendship. But now its gone sour cause of HER...October was alright, nothing special happen, I didn't do anything for Halloween. November was kick ass, my cousin from London was in town for the entire month, we went to Orlando, Cape Canaveral and a bunch of small shops around Northern and Central Florida, and a concert at the end of the month with that special someone to top it off. December has been going pretty depressing now...but I'll keep ya updated fools. I must move on..............."

All on the outside looking in.

Display this moment to see what you've become.
Defined by what you sell, those lies packaged well.
But you know that we can see right through you.
Attention's wearing thin so type it out again.
I hope this all made you happy.
Forfeit all of your integrity for a temporary high.
Lay it all out for the world to see.

Hi kids, do you like 5 inch tips?,
Wanna see me stick chrome fender flares over each one of my Konigs?
Wanna follow me and do exactly as I did?
Try NOS and get your motor f***ed up worse then my life is?
My brain's dead weight,
I'm trying to get my head straight,
but I can't figure out which sticker to put over my license plate.
And the mechanic says ""Rice Burner you's a crack head?
""Nu-uh""
""Then why's your car dead, man its wasted ""
Well since age 9 I've wanted an Si so I could put chrome 18's on it and make it run 16.9's.
Got pissed off and ripped all my Honda emblems off,
And replaced them with ""R"" badges so people know I'm not soft.
I smoke a big bowl of chron, lay in my lawn
For longer then it took me to put my altezzas on.
""Come here bastard"" ""Dude, wait a minute that's a viper, dawg!!""
I don't give a f***; I'll just fly by and put my hazards on!
Hi! My name is (who?)... My name is (what)... My name is
(scratches)...
Rice Burner!

I pull up to the starting line, from a fifty roll I'm usually fine,
But dem godd@mn V ten Ponies smoke me all the time.
99% of my crew I have to lie to,
I just found out a salad shooter makes more torque than I do,
My chrome 15's own, my Integra's a Type-R clone,
****, even my kanji decals are worth 10 horsepower alone.

Hi! My name is (who?)... My name is (what)... My name is

Stop the race, this car needs to be locked away.
Not even Justin Timberlake in drag is this gay.
I talk a mad line of jive, at the track I barely survive,
But an 8 foot aluminum wing looks bitchin on a front wheel drive.

"event","Sipping Vodka
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak. After
mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, ""When I am worried about getting nervous on the
pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get
nervous, I take a sip.""
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the
sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.
Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the
door:
1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and
the Spook.
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he
was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, ""Take this and
eat it for it is my body."" He did not say ""Eat me""
12. The Virgin Mary is not called ""Mary with the Cherry,""
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the
grub, yeah God.
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's, not a
peter pulling contest at St. Taffy's"

"event","File-sharing has enabled music fans from around the world to build the largest library of recorded music in history. While this should be cause for celebration, large record labels have spent the last three years attacking peer-to-peer technology and the people who use it, but neither user-empowering technologies nor consumer desire for easy access to digital music are evil! the problem is that there is no adequate system in place that allows music lovers access to their favorite music while compensating artists and copyright holders. its time to start addressing this problem head on, its time to face the fact that the copyright law is curenly broken everyday, its making criminals out of music lovers and technologists, college students are being sued, ISPs being forced to rat out their customers, some members of congress are calling for college students to be jailed for file sharing, the list goes on and on. but there are more than 60 million plus people in the US along that use file sharing network programs, more than the amount of people who voted for George W. Bush. if we all can band together and stand up for our rights, we can change the law. if we were to bring all music together, it would be more than we could imagine, over a trillion shared files, in the north america alone."

"event","Weird Sex Laws
(I wonder how many of these are true!)

In Lebanon, men are legally allowed to with animals, but the animals must be female. Any relations with a male animal is punishable by death. (Like THAT makes sense)

In Bahrain, a male doctor may legally examine a woman's genitals, but Is prohibited from looking directly at them during the examination. He may only see their reflection in a mirror.

Muslims are banned from looking at the genitals of a corpse. This Also applies to undertakers. The sex organs of the deceased must be covered with a brick or piece of wood at all times. (A brick??)

The penalty for ion in Indonesia is decapitation. (Wonder which head?)

There are men in Guam whose full-time job is to travel the countryside and deflower young virgins, who pay them for the privilege of the first time... Reason: under Guam law, it is expressly forbidden for virgins to marry. (Let's just think for a minute. Is there any job anywhere else in the world that even comes close to this?)

In Hong Kong, a betrayed wife is legally allowed to kill her adulterous husband, but may only do so with her bare hands. The husband's lover, on the other hand, may be killed in any manner desired. (Ah! Justice!)

Saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England - but only in Tropical fish stores. (But of course!)

In Cali, Colombia, a woman may only with her husband, and the first time this happens, her mother must be in the room to witness the act. (Makes one shudder at the thought, I'd rather die a virgin!)

In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, it is illegal for a man to with a woman and her daughter at the same time. (I presume this was a big enough problem that they had to pass this law?)

In Maryland, it is illegal to sell condoms from vending machines, with one exception: prophylactics may be dispensed from a vending machine only ""in places where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the premises."" (Is this a great country or what? ... But not as great as Guam!)"

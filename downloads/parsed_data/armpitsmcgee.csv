"event","so.. I've been back from UP (HAHAH!) north for almost a week and haven't updated. but anyway, Isle Royal was awesome. Even though it was cold and overcast&nbsp; for most of the time I was there, it was still one of the most beautiful places that I've ever been to.&nbsp; and I never use that word. It was a great time, despite the blistering and slight departure of three of my toenails from their respective toes. and the not showering for 6.5 days. 

anyway, I think I will most definitely be going back next year, probably with my father, because I found out that he wanted to go. 

so, as soon as i get a day off (Monday or Wednesday) I will post the pictures. I printed them out today at work, and it ended up being 173!!! that's over $20! crazy!"

I am going to see Jackson Browne in July. it will be awesome.

I worked at Sue's new store today and it was the slowest thing ever. I was the only one there and I still just stood there for a large piece of time. but they have Arnold Palmer AriZona tea, so it was alright. the breakroom had a weird bench like the ones that used to be at Zap Zone. and there was no closet behind the counter for me to fart in."

"event","So Chicago was mostly fun. I didn't get any of my paper of studying done that I was supposed to do during the 12 hours of transit time over the weekend, but that's ok. I'm glad I went - RENT was so much better with both Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp than with Anthony Rapp and the Adam Pascal replacement Roger. I was happy that he got better and was able to do the show. Ugh, God. It was so good! They were crying! it was so emotional! I'm not ashamed to admit that I might have been crying at certain parts! hah! but i like chicago. i went to the field museum and that was awesome. the dinosaurs were a delight. i was kind of mad that the Aztec exhibit was sold out, though. 

but blugh, we ate so much food. bad for us food that I shat 5 times in 3 hours before leaving the hotel, then like... 3 more times that day. a $96 takeout bill for 4 people is just wrong. 

anywhoo... I just got back from the &quot;electrician&quot; cardiologist that works in the same office as the &quot;plumber&quot; that I saw before. He said there was nothing really wrong with me, but gave me the choice to go on Beta Blockers or not. I chose not, because I don't really want to be on lots of medications for everything. The less the better. He also told me that a low salt diet wouldnt be good for me, and that I need a higher blood volume so I should not cut back like the other doctor told me. 

anyway, i have to finish my paper (about synesthesia, so awesome!!) and study so hard for my exams tomorrow. Asshole made them all the same day."

It should be fun, although it will be a lot of walking and carrying things, and no showers for a week. but I don't care about that, as long as I don't have my period! ahha! anyway, so i think i will have to start getting into shape now, so that I won't be one of those people who dies in the wilderness..... or has to be airlifted to Wisconson via seaplane. The only thing that I am worried about is my very active colon and its trecherous nature.&nbsp; and the six hour boat rise to the island from Houghton.&nbsp;"

"event","God I hate Sarah Palin. She is such an ignorant and evil bitch. 

Why the fuck does she think she has a right to kill every non-human thing&nbsp;that moves? No one&nbsp;better&nbsp;kill a human fetus, because that would be wrong -- lets all just go out and&nbsp;throw some poison gas&nbsp;at wolf babies instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;That will make everything better. And while we're at it, why don't we shoot thier moms, too. Then let's say we're doing it to feed our families. 

I think someone should follow her around in a goddamn helicopter until she can't run anymore then shoot her and leave her to die a slow and agonizing death. See how she likes it. 

I'm sure she'd take it like a maverick."

"event","Damn you, HULU!! i checked the site for Roswell, because i was interested in taking a stroll down middle school memory lane and watch my favorite show from that time. so... i just watched 22 episodes since tuesday night after neurobio lab (where i skinned a cat, btw... gross). My mother says i'm obsessed, but i think that a lie. wither way i have to stop watching because only the first season is posted. i may have to just buy the damn series. i think i would have to call it my second or third favorite of all time, after the x-files and david the gnome. oh! and forever knight.&nbsp; ugh, these dicks. they should post it this week so i can waste my last spring break watching it.

anywhoo.. i had my stress test, echocardiogram and i got my event monitor today. the tests went fine, altough my pulse and blood pressure were super high, but the lady told me that was normal because it was my first time (like the cold clammy hands of a nervous virgin!). but i must say that this damn event monitor is really annoying. i have to call this 1-800 number when it records stuff and transmit it like some walking dial-up modem. it happened twice in the first two hours of having it, and i have to wait on hold for a total of 20 minutes already. and it beeps real annoying like, which is gonna be awesome in class. 

also, my cousins are staying with us for a week or two, and thier dog is so fat and cute, but he barks at everything, this really loud, long and deep yet high pitched howl, especially in the middle of the night. he keeps waking me up. i really have to pee, but i dont want him to start screaming and wake everybody up. i think i might risk it, because i like my bed dry."

"event","I would like to take this time to once again profess my hatred for Uof M-Dearborn. Not only do they have no internship office for anthropology students/a reallly tiny department with only about... 5 faculty members, including the advisor, they have once again inticed my wrath with their inability to create class schedules of any value. with such a small campus,&nbsp;faculty can only teach certain classes once a year, and many of the upper-level classes are scheduled at the same time. here is a list of why i hate UM-D:

#&nbsp;1: I was all happy that I could take a Population Genetics and Evolution&nbsp; class, and that they were also offering a Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates class, right when I discovered that what I really want to do is get a degrees in Biology and Anthropology. Beause I have no time to get a degree in bio, I decided to just get a minor. So I was all... yay!! then I discoveredthat they are overlap by a paltry 20 minutes! and it was a lab section, so i was like... maybe the professor will lat me sign up for both and just let me leave early from lab. no. so then I scheduled all this shit out, and was ready to register (which I have to do on my own, because there is no set of required courses forthe anthro department, and i dont have an assigned counsellor anyway, so i always have to explain things to new people). so i started to register and it was all.... !!!!!! PREQ ERROR !!!!!! and I was like... ok...&nbsp; so i looked at the list of requirement and was all... no, you ass. but then i realized that no, i didnt take that calculus class last year, because i said &quot;what will i ever need this for?&quot;&nbsp;

# 2: so then i was all.. damn.. i can take that class. because that was the one that i really wanted to take. but then i was happy, because i could then take the Comparative Anatomy class and the neurobiology class that i now found discovered that I could take. so i was all... yay! then I disovered that, since I only have one more class to take to finsh my art history minor, i looked for a class that I could take. but... oh yeah, no.. they all overlap with my two lab periods. the four upperlevel art history classes that are being offered this semester (the last until next fall), share two times, two during my tue/thur lab and two during my mon/wed labs. so now i have to decide if i want to finish my art history minor (which, hell yeah I am) or get a bio minor.

#&nbsp;3: I have no idea how/where to go to get an internship, or if i will even be able to get one. there is only an intrnship office for history, CIS, sciences, poliical science, etc..... pretty much everything but anthropology. I think i will have to try the co-op office, ad see what i can get there. that's another thing that I hate. everywhere else requires internships to gradute, but not the awesome&nbsp;UM-D. I could go my entire school caree and not get any sort of internship or fieldschool. so basically, I would have absolutely no chance of getting hired in the job market. 

anyway, i could go one, but i am getting more and more pissed as i write. Plus, I've spent the past almost 4 hours trying to schedule my classes, and I have a paper due tomorrow that I have to write still. so goodnight."

Monday: work 4-10
Tuesday and Thursday:&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molec &amp; Cellular Biology 9:55&nbsp;- 11:10
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World Cultures 1:05 - 2:20
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction to Primates 3:00 - 4:15
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egyptian Art 4:35 - 5:50
Wednesday: Molec &amp; Cellular Biology lab 5:00 - 9:00
Friday: work 3 - 10
Saturday: work 9-5
Sunday: homework, avoiding Marilyn and Muky time

This semester sucks, because I will only be able to see Muky on sundays, if his new manager doesn't start to schedule him on sunday nights. If he does, then I dont know when we will be able to see each other... every other saturday? hahaha... fucking balls. It always works out like this and he's got classes when I get and vice versa. but hopefully, I will be done with school after next semester. i could most likely graduate at the end of this semster, bu ti am just not ready for that. i need to get an internship or co-op first. plus, i sort of want to get a bio minor, because i fucked around and by the time i wanted to double major in bio and anthro, it was too late and I had wasted too much money. so now i just need to finish and see what I can do with this damn thing. on a lighter note, my savings/checking acount has slipped below $70, something that has not happened since I was in high school. dag."

"event","&nbsp;ugh, god. I've never been so disgusted with CVS and/or my fellow employees. I am so fucking sick of be the shit of the store. I'm an even bigger shit-oned person than colin is and that is saying something. Today was another oe of those days that had me throwing things, and yell/cussing at things. It was so fucking hot, and I was stuck with the non-working sisters, who made me do practically everything because they apparently couldnt manage to climb a flight of stairs and move some goddamn boxes.&nbsp;so.. because of their lazy asses and colin's being a minor, I had to be the overstock putter-awayer and the backup cashier, all while those fucking lazy dicks stood around talking. in between their saying shit to colin and i about how we need to pick up the pace and ""get all this shit put away!"" fuck that. I am so fucking shit of this shit. as i said last week after working a horrendous and seemingly eternal five hour shift with marilyn and shelly last week, I am not paid enough to do the work of three people. DO YOUR FUCKING JOBS, ASSHOLES.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Not only was i expected to do both jobs, but one of the bitch twins came up to me while i was ringing up some customers that were in line to tell me that the belt was full and it needed to be emptied. 

Plus it was hot as fuck up there, at least 15 degrees hotter than downstairs, and everyone was bitchinga about ho hot it was down there with their fans and&nbsp;air conditioning while the sweat was dripping off my nose. And I had to be up there for about 3 hours. So... I just started to take breaks, sitting on boxes, laying down to do my daily backercizes, texting angie, etc. fuck you, bitches. then they had the fucking nerve to look at me and say ""we appreciate you, Melissa!"" I was so pissed i just looked at them and walked away, and have not looked at/talked to them since. 

I am writing my resume tomorrow and&nbsp;going to the internship/co-op/career services office on monday. Get me the fuck out of cvs. I am sick of all the bullshit, everyone bitching about everyone else and talking behind everyone else's backs, the stupid customers, the fucking pervs that hit on me (especially that nasty four-toothed drunk man that started rubbing my shoulders). Ugh. makes me sick just thinking about him. All the rude fucking people who get bitchy and call corporate for not smiling at them or being rude to them while they are yelling at someone on their phones, and being all ""wutz muh total!?"" without even looking at me. looks at the fucking screen, bitch, i dont want to interrupt such an important conversation detailing what sorts of alohol you drank or who your girl be sleepin wit, or where the fuck you are going to drink some Bud Light, WHOO! Shut the fuck up and get out. 

to top it off, I lost the order for for my 5 year ""appretiation gift"" as well as the invitation to angela's baby shower. it is either in a tote that will eventually go back to the warehouse, or it is in the garbage. Either way, I have to tell her that i lost it somewhere. She's gonna be mad, and i feel bad.&nbsp;

Ugh.. and the goddamn nightshift talking about how stupid the day people are, right in front of me, and bitching about EVERYTHING. If you dont fucking like it, you dick, do it yourself. and stop the motherfucking whistling or i will cut your lips off. thank you and goodnight.&nbsp;

P.S. Muky (eventhough you don't read this), I am pissed at you."

"event","&nbsp;Poop. Easter was fun, I guess. I did eat too much, and felt gross for&nbsp;a large period of time, but at least I was only picking at the copious amounts of candy at the table, and didnt even have any of the traditional and&nbsp;delicious pretzel Jell-o.&nbsp; But I did have some of the ham, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, rolls, pineapple, carrots (with cinnamon!), with some banana, pineapple and strawberry juice. which was good. then for dessert i also partook in the pumpkin and cherry pies, which were delicious, even though aunt crystal said that they didnt come out right.&nbsp;<br /><br />For some reason, I was just reminded of my ""delicious monstrocity"" that i handcrafte last week. It was pistachio and chocolate puddings with a carmalized homemade grham cracker crust (not a good thing, as it would only come up off of the pan after&nbsp;insistant prodding and spatula scraping. The caramel-chocolate chips sprinkled on the top didn't help the stickings in the teeth, either. But it was good, although unusual. I don't know what made me think of this, but i did!<br /><br />the highlight of the night was when the Dearborn Heights police officer that one of my uncles knew came over to either buy something (the family is VERY active in th Craig's list community - it pays the bills these days) or just visit. Because there was no room in our&nbsp;driveway, he had to park in the neighbor's&nbsp;driveway, which caused Speedoman to come outside in his bathrobe and say ""Gee,&nbsp;Officer, I hope this has nothing to do with me!"" and look all nervous. Yeah, that's right... he was coming for your Speedos. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, I have been eating better (and less) than I have been, which has been good, although I have been sick for the past 1.5 weeks or so.&nbsp;The candy has been a setback, but i think once I am feeling better, I will be getting back on that old DDR horse again. I have a weakness for it, and i have begun to suck at it. I just dont have the endurance that i used to. I also dont have an inhaler anymore, which preobably does not help. <br /><br />In other news, I just watched a very strange movie, perhaps a mistake after a large meal. <em>The History Boys</em> is English and hard to understand like most British people are. but there were 3 actors from the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies in it, which was weird, because Uncle Vernon was a homosexual high-school general studies teacher who happened to be ""fondling his students genitales"" while on his motorbike. It was alll very strange, with lots of homosexuality, yet no actual sex scenes or anything even close. I was angry and waiting until the end when no one had sex! damn!<br /><br />anyway.... i am still so far behind in my classes that I am no longer even trying to catch up. fuck this. I have all this shit to do for like.... 3 group project with presentations coming up in the next week or two that i havent even started yet an it's just getting annoying.&nbsp; and stupid holidays dont help, either. I saw Muky last night after work, and consequently did not get any of the work done that I had planned to/needed to get done. damn me. &nbsp;ugh... he&nbsp; brought over his PS3 and HDMI cable and hooked it up to our HD TV. we watched one of the free movies that he got - <em>Wild Hogs</em> - which would have been a good movie, at least visually, if it had not sucked so much, orbeen so predictable. I seriously knew everything that was going to happen before it did. exceppt the end part. which was stupid anyway.<br /><br />Today I got absolutely nothing&nbsp;done,&nbsp;and this means when I go to Earth Lore or somewhere else&nbsp;to do&nbsp;my ethnography of wicca rituals or something like that in the Detroit area, I will not know what to look for or ask about (for my Myth Magic and Mind class). oh well.&nbsp;<br /><br />In other news, for one of my other Anthro classes - the one that I am fellowshipping for -&nbsp;our groups'&nbsp;community partner Kay Cumbow from the Citizens for Alternatives to Chemical Contamination has provided us with some very interesting information about nuclear power and the Fermi plant (which is the topic of my second group project). This class had made me think about persuing environmental anthropology instead of the other sorts of anthropology, and perhaps journalism or something of that sort. I hate to admit it, because he is kind of an arrogant ass, but the professor who teaches this class, and a few others that I have taken has a right to be. he is extremely radical and has had over 40 jobs in his lifetime -- which equals alot of experience. which is kind of admirable, if scary. plus, i would have to extend my schooling for at least another..... 2 semesters. which is ass.&nbsp;<br /><br />ooooook, i think i will now finally start this fucking paper i was supossed to be writing tonight. Goodnight, bitches!"

"event","&nbsp;Ugh... fuck, today was a bad day.&nbsp;

I woke up with a rather sizeable headache, then I fond that there was no food for breakfast&nbsp; (there was only one egg left [which was for the meatloaf], I did't leave Jessie's house until after 1.30, and didnt feel like driving over to Kroger before I went home to get bananas for this morning), my mom woke me up about a half hour before my alarm went off (while vacuuming, how she used to wake me up all the time last summer, and letting the front storm door slam like she used to wake me up every Sunday (my only day to sleep in) for the past like... three years (since the head of my bed is right on the opposite sside of the wall, I can hear every opening and closing of the door). So then I asked mom why she felt the need to vacuum and hit my door with it at 9.30 in the morning, especially since I vacuumed yesterday. And she was all... ""Well, I'm sorry, but it is my day off, and I cant just wait around for you to wake up, I've got alot of shit to do! and the floors eed to be vacuumed everyday!"" I do&nbsp;remember when she used to vacuum everyday, and do the dishes at least three times a day, and wet dust at least one time a week, and I can say that the house seemed no cleaner then than it does now. NO, THE FLOORS DO NOT NEED TO BE CLEANED EVERY FUCKING DAY. THEY ARE CLEAN ENOUGH. I MIGHT EVEN EAT PUDDIng OFF OF THEM.... NO I WOULDNT.

Aaaanyway, where was I in my whiney bitching story? oh yeah... so then i was getting ready for&nbsp; school, and i remembered that i still needed to print off my assignment for my first class of the day. so i waited for about... 8.5 minutes for my computer to start, then waited another 4 minutes for the Microsoft Word to start, then i had to wait another 3 minutes ffor Word to convert the file. Alll of this while having to pee so hard but not being able to because mom switchd to cleaning the bathroom. so i finallly got the paper loaded, and i fixed all the stupid little errors and finished those unfinished sentances that I forot about, then printed the fusker. then i went to pee and told momma to skidattl or i would pee on her floor. so i peed, then went and pput that bitchass paper in my backpack (in the wrong folder, btw). anyway, then i went to look for food and there was none, so i made me a peanut butter and lettuce sandwich (minus banana and mayo :( wah!) after this, i ran downstairs to get my clothes out of the dryer and get ready leave, and found out that my pants werent dry in the crotch, eventhough they had been dried twice for like... 2 hours. well, then i was all moist and gross feeling, and my ass kept popping out the top, due to the shirt combination i was wearing. but then i finally left, and drove away, but then i remembered that i forgot my trail mix (BIIITCH!) i said, oh well, i dont need it that bad. then as i was nearing 96, i realized... I dont have my paper! so i got all angry, then drove all the way home and was like.. wait... did i check... and there it was! stuck to another folder! so i swore and put my seatbelt back on and skind my knuckle. so then there was blood running own my finger and i had to wipe it on my shirt. plus i got pissed and ripped the skin flap off and threw it onmy floor so there was nothing to cover the wound. so then i left again... 15 minutes late for class at this point. (but i turned on RENT and rocked the Roger, so I started to feel better). then nothing reall happened until&nbsp;i got to Dearborn, when the front of my car fell into one of the largest, stealthiest potholes i have ever seen. i just love the potholes that seem to be all over all of the roads in the d and dearborn that are bigger than my waist. i mean, seriously. what the fuck? you could fit about 3 yorkies in there. and then i go rolling up to the parking lot and was cruising through the parking lot (because i got there late, there were very few spots open) and went looking for a spot and couldnt find any, so i had to go to the other lot on the other side of the campus, because i was&nbsp;15 minutes late for class at this point. after a 10 minute walk to the CASL, i took the elevator so i wouldnt be any later climbing the 4 flghts of stairs. so i finally got to class and slipped in while the professor's back was turned, but since the only seat open was right next to the whiteboard, he noticed.&nbsp;plus, my feet were wet from a the melting snow and sidewalk-covering oceans. i also discovered that while i was not at&nbsp;class on wednesday, the class made a survey and today we were surveying each other (which was actually fun, as my partner was cool). and then at the end of class, i asked the lady next to me if they turned the apers in and she was like.. yeah, most people did, but he said he will take them on wednesday. was like.... DAMN.&nbsp;

so after that class, which was actually fun(ish), i was in a better mood, so decided to go to kroger to get the cheese, eggs, milk and bananas that we needed (AND A MOON PIE FOR ME!!). i got there and the truck had just go there so there were U-Boats everywehere and there was noplace to move. i went inon the produce/starbucks side and got the bananas and soymilk, but decided that i did not want any part of those pricy eggs, so i&nbsp;went through my coupons and got the one for the regular eggs and set them n the shelf while i picked up my shit. then i went over to the regular egg section.&nbsp;and went to pick a carton up&nbsp;but said...&nbsp;whee are those coupons? I lef the on the shelf!!! so i had to walk to the other side of the store and pick up my coups, while&nbsp;every kroger employee in southeast michigan stood in my way and&nbsp;old people cut in front of me. then i went back and got my coups and tried to find some cheese. then i went to the checkout counter and started to ring my things up and was like.. where the fuck are my eggs!? so.. i didnt get the eggs. but i left and then i was trying to get out of the prking lot (after almost getting run over by some old lady) and was trying to turn left onto 5 mile. which was a no go for like..5 minutes. people kept&nbsp;coming up inthe left lane and blocking me. so then this big ass truck comes up behind me and a kroger&nbsp;semi comes up in the left lane, and starts to&nbsp;make the turn WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY CANNOT MAKE WITHOUT RUNNING ME OVER. SO HE CUTS OFF THE TRAFFIC ON THE ONE SIDE, CREATES A BUILD-UP OF CARS AND COMES ABOUT&nbsp;I------------------------I THAT CLOSE TO MY CAR WITH THE BACK WHEELS. I WAS LIKE... GASP. SO HE&nbsp;OPENS HIS DOOR AND STARTS YELLING TO BACK UP, WHICH ICANNOT DO WITHOUT HITTING THE TRUCK BEHIND ME. AND I CANT GET OUT, EITHER BECAUSE THE CARS ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE GOING AROUND IN THE LEFT TURN LANE&nbsp;AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED. SO THEN THE TRUCK BEHIND ME FIINALLY BACKS UP AND I MOVEENOUGH SO THAT I DONE GET RUN OVER, BUT WAS ABOUT 5 INCHES FROM BEING IN THE&nbsp;RIGHT LANE, AND NO ONE WOULD LET ME OUT, THEY JUST SWERVED AND LOOKED AT ME EVILLY. so then i had to go right and through the subdivision.&nbsp;when i finally got home, my mom was like.... oh, i went to the store an got bananas and milk already. i just looked at her. and she said ""if you would have called and said you were going to the store, i would have told you!""&nbsp; but i forgot my phone, too.&nbsp;

but then my day started to look up, when i went online and decided to watch last week's Degrassi. then i decided to check out the about a girl site and found out that that, like the best years, has been cancelled. my two favorite shows!!! and they both had the most evil cliff hangers ever!!! i am so pissed at the n right now.... and forever.

so... we had meatloaf for dinner tongith and it was delicious. i guess my day wasnt that bad. i've had worse.&nbsp;

anyway, i still only have about 5 pages done of this midterm for wednesday and i have a but-ton more shit to do, so i will just post this. excuse the grammatical errors, i am not checkking oor proofreading ths. FUCK THAT!!"

"event","<p>Ok, I am taking ANOTHER unneeded break in the studying/trying to write this 10 page midterm. It's just not going well. At least it isnt due until Wednesday. but I also have another midterm on tuesday&nbsp;and paper to write for monday .... BBOOOOO!!!!<br /><br />Anyway... the reason for my post! Me and Angie&nbsp;were the awesomest things ever today. First we went to the Omlette place and got our fat on.&nbsp; I got butter on my bagel because i am ""a fatty"". hahahah (angie, you mean face!). I decided to switch things up and got a Polish (one egg with bagel, cream cheese and jelly, lettce and sour cream sauce on the side) instead of the Deli, which I found delightful, although angie prefers it when i get the deli. she got the country omlette 1 egg, no lettuce, white bread with gravy on the top as usual. After that, we went to CVS and picked up our checks. Toya told us to save her from the annoying customer that was walking up, but I didnt realize she was right there, so she had to ring her up anyway. then i said sorry and we left. i dont like it in cvs, especially after my 5 days off (which has gone incredibly fast, btw).&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, then angie had to poop real hard but she held it in so she would be angry when she had to yell at the Verison people. as it turned out, there was no reason to yell at them, but it still took forever to get that shit done. so while i was standing there alone, i decided that i wanted to&nbsp;change all of the phones' wallpapers to the same thing -&nbsp;my face. angie came over and started lauging, then started to help me with this monumental task! we finished, though, just in time, as the man was finishing her stuff up and walking over, we were finishng the last phone. it was funny as hell when the people were looking at the phones and everyone they looked at had a picture similar to my&nbsp;userpic as the wallpaper. it was great fun! the people were looking at us, but it was funner than asses!!<br /><br />and we were listening to rent and High School Musical and singing along the whole way like always, so......yeah.&nbsp; It was also decided that, because&nbsp; i cannot hit the high notes that Maureen hits, I have been bumped to the spot of Joanne, which is awesome, because i am black now. I also sing the parts of Collins and <strong>Roger</strong>, who is my soulmate. if i could be&nbsp;a man and sing the Rents, i would&nbsp;HAVE to be Roger.&nbsp;<br /><br />Ok, i think it is imperative that I get working on this fucking midterm, especially because i need a B+ in this class (at the very least!!) &nbsp;to finally make it into Phi Theta Kappa.&nbsp;&nbsp;i muscht now read about Hitler.</p>"

Most professors are just so busy and overworked (or stupid or lazy or just don't give a damn) and they keep changing all of thier crap.&nbsp;

I still have nothing to do but attendance for my Civic Engagement Fellowship, my Qualitative Research Methods professor announced in class today (which I missed due to an overactive colon and sleep cycle) that our next assignments were to be done in groups, and also that my civic engagement midterm was changed the day before from a multiple choice 50 question exam to an essay format group exam.&nbsp;

This is getting so ridiulous that I an sure to drop out if it hadn't been so goddamn expensive.&nbsp;"

So now i have another day to (hopefully) finish the readinds and maybe work on the memorizations of the formulas.&nbsp;

Other than that, this weekedn was good, I saw Muky on Sunday, as it is our weekly see-each-other day. we made chicken pot pie and this delicious lemon chaffon pie thing. then at midnight he told me ""oh yeah, i might need to be getting out of here early tonight. i'm helping my dad work at 4."" and was like... do you have school? wait.. i thought you worked tomorrow!"" to which he replied tat he was working at 4 in the morning..... 3 hours from the time he left. so i threw him out.

i am now sitting here eating lunch before work, a delightful banana, peanut butter, mayonnaise and lettuce sangwich. and some cinnamon tea.&nbsp;"

Even HFCC, which is right next door, is closed.&nbsp; This is ass. I was all ready to go to class, take that damn quiz we always have (and pass it, like I never have yet). I was getting ready to raise my 4% in that class to a new.... 34%!!! NoW I have to miss another quiz and my grade is now going to slip down to..... 1%.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; This does not bode well. Now I will never get into Phi Alpha Theta!!! I was only one GPA point away last semester! And now.... RUINED! But both my mommy and my son have forbidden me from driving to school tonight, so I will stay home. Plus, looking out the window and seeing how fast these assholes are going makes me think twice about going outside, let alone on the roads. <br /><br />Anyway, this day off will give me a chance catch up on all the reading that I have not yet done, and perhaps start on next week's&nbsp;homeworks/readings, because&nbsp;I will be working all of my homework days next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Alright, well I think I will get me another cup of tea and get started on this enormous task!!<br /><br />Kristina will rub me!!!"

I am ready to just send this mother fucking thing back and be done with it.&nbsp; 

I am really irritated that after&nbsp;almost 4&nbsp;hours of being on the phone with 3 different Customer Service people from two different companies that I still have no idea how to connect to the fucking internet, or why AT&amp;T is saying that our encryption key is wrong, or&nbsp;all this other shit. Everyone is saying&nbsp;different things&nbsp;and shifting the blame on someone else.&nbsp;Who the fuck can help me if you fuckers cant? 

Unless I just have to send this new computer that I've had for&nbsp;5 days back&nbsp;Dell for repairs.&nbsp; And if that is the case, they can just keep the damn thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

And the Dell man saying ""hhrmmm.. this is really strange... I don't understand why this is doing this....""&nbsp; and then following up with a ""this is the second call like this I've had on this system recently"" doesn't help. 

Ugh, my head hurts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In other news, I got the information about my fellowship with the Civic Engagement Project at school, including my end of the semester $500 stipend. I dont care what I have to do... bring on the monies!! I det to take attendence!"

It is doing this thing that if it decides that it doesn't want to stay on anymore, it wont. And it also doesn;t restart after it has been shut off and/or shut itself off and it refuses to restart for like... hours... or the next day. It is really very fucking annoying, and seeing as how I got it at Best Buy like... 8 months ago, I have a feeling I will be screwed. Why is it that everytime my bank account reaches any point above $500, something happens and I have to spend hundreds of dollars on some unexpected shit?&nbsp; Fuck this. I am hating monies right now. </p><p>Although I do find it sort of humorous that all of my electronics are united in their love for the almighty Blue Screen of Death. Now even my phone does it!! HAHA! I think they are plotting against me.... they are like the Lowell Mill workers of the 19th century - they are overworked and underpaid and they won't stand for it any longer!!&nbsp; I hate electronics strikes.&nbsp;<br /><br />On&nbsp;a positive note, I got my hair fixed today.[for free].. and it is now much more pleasing than it has been for the past week. I also bought some fancy hair styling product that actually cost more than $3.&nbsp; I know, I know... it was crazy. I hope it works. If not I will just add that the the list of stupid shit that is pissing me off and stealing my monies.&nbsp;<br /><br />I guess I will call Best Buy tomorrow and see what the hell. they will probably either just tell me that it is too bad for me, or they will jst transfer me all around until someone finally lies to me and says there is nothing they can do. Yay.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh! I almost forgot!&nbsp; I did a real stupid the other day. I was bringing back a book to the library that I was supposed to have read for class (but I ended up just buying my own copy) and I returned the wrong copy!! HAHA! YES, THAT IS RIGHT. I RETURNED MY COPY, NOT THE LIBRARY'S! SO NOT ONLY WAS I CHARGED $.20/DAY IN FINES, I ALSO LOST THE COPY THAT WAS MINE! But, as a consolation, the librarian lady told me that all unrecovered Lost and Found books were seen as Donations and that at their next book fair in FEBRUARY, I may find my book. And if i do... I can have it. For free.&nbsp; THANK YOU LIBRARY, YOU ARE SO KIND.&nbsp; They can't just look through the fucking new stack of donations in their basement that would take like... 10 minutes, oh no... I must come back in February to find my book. Fuckers.&nbsp; So i&nbsp;finally brought myself to go to the school bookstore and buy the fucking copy they have there - softcover, I might add - that was like... $8 more expensive than the hardcover one I bought online. I was super pissed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, seeing as how I am almost 30 chapters behind in my reading, I think I should go try to do some of that before I fall asleep.&nbsp;<br /><br />Two days till Thrice!!

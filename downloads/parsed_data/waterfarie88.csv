So I was stupid the first time and deleted the first line of code.

That's going a bit too far in their crusade for animals. It's not like using the term owner versus guardian will change how people treat their pets or how the pets treat the people."

"event","So my birthday was just this past Saturday.  On friday, I went out to Maggiano's to eat with Pauline, Aakruti, Melodie, Anna, Sahithi, Luke, Caleb, and John.  Pretty much all the people I've either worked with or lived with.  XP  Ate WAY too much food.  Then I went to John's apartment for the weekend.  He bought me one of those ipod nanos that JUST came out!  Those things are so expensive.  He also got me the new little mermaid dvd because I wanted it.  He even watched it with me.  ^_^  I got breakfast in bed both days.  Have I mentioned lately just how much I love this boy?  He's planning on taking me to the City Tavern and the Adventure Aquarium on the 18th.  I'm so excited.  City Tavern is MAD expensive though.  :(  Maybe I can convince him to let me pay for my half.  A stupid entree is $30.  Then we made tons of pasta so I could take it back to the dorm.  So apparently 6 girls eating pasta for every meal since Sunday night = pasta gone by today.  Um... yeah... next time, need MORE pasta."

"event","It's week 2 and I'm already stressed with lots of tests and stuff...

Bio 218 - Class scares me.  I studied so much for that stupid quiz yesterday and it ended up being something I could have studied for in 5 mins.  Saunders is a pretty good teacher though.

Bio 219 - Lab sounds cool.  Cloning the lux operon from V. Fischeri into E.coli.  Duwel also seems like a good teacher.

Chem 241 - I hate orgo.  Wade isn't bad, he's just boring.  I need to study orgo and try to remember stuff from last term.

Physics 152 - Ug... physics = bane of my existance.  Yuan is really soft-spoken and Asian so he's kinda hard to understand.  Thank god I have Hessler's notes from AP Physics.

Ecology - Hearn is awesome!  She was talking about how sexual reproduction was important and said ""that's why about 10% of you are thinking about sex right now.""  XP  She's the type of teacher that will play Spore (which I got from my grandparents on my birthday).  I hate the subject though, but she makes it fun.

Creative Writing - Levin seems nice but I'm worried about her grading.  Most of English is subjective and not objective grading."

"event","So I just got back from CA today.  Well, this morning.  My plane touched down at 5:51 A.M.  I've been sleeping most of the day, lol.  I was in CA from the 28th to the 6th.

Friday - Rehearsal Dinner
Well, technically I landed Thursday night, but I went to sleep after John's sister and her family landed (their plane was after mine).  I loved seeing John after not seeing him for 10 weeks.  We hugged and kissed and then left for the car with his mom.  Friday morning = meeting everyone in his family.  That was an interesting experience.  The rehearsal was interesting.  John's sister and her husband ""adopted"" me so I could sit up in the 2nd row with the family, lol.  The dinner was pretty good.  John and I picked up the two cakes.  His aunt Natalie fell on a step and twisted her ankle while breaking a center piece.  :(  She believes in some cock and bull homeopathic remedy.  It was hard holding my tongue when she was buying it.  We took Haley and Ashleigh home before the rehearsal dinner technically ended because they were falling asleep.  Matt came too.

Saturday - Wedding
Wtf, it was an expensive wedding.  Over $100,000 by the bride's family.  Everyone looked so pretty though.  The sword whack by Mike was funny though.  Then on to the reception.  I was left alone when they took family pictures.  Felt a tiny bit left out but then hung out with the Hatton's (John's cousins).  Then onto dinner.  I had to sit at the head table because that's where John was.  I love that boy... I really do.  Lots of dancing ensued.  John's grandparents looked absolutely adorable dancing together.  Haley (the 10 year old) is a bundle of energy... quite literally.  She danced with EVERYONE except John, even random people she didn't know.  Everyone thought she was so adorable, lol.  I danced until my feet hurt.  Then danced some more.  I was really tired after that.

Sunday - Mountasia
We celebrated Haley's 10th birthday.  Went to Mountasia, which is kinda like the Funplex here.  I drive like an Asian when I'm in go-karts.  Even with a really slow kart, I passed a lot of people and cut a lot of people off.  Then mini golf.  Haley and Ashleigh both got legitimate hole-in-ones.  John got 1 too.  Matt and I just suck, lol.  John/Matt ended up winning with me and Haley coming in second.  Then off to bumper boats.  Me/Haley, Ashleigh, Brad (John's brother-in-law) all ganged up against John to soak him, lol.  Then inside for lunch and arcade games.  I thought both girls giant pezzes because I wanted to get Haley a present but then thought it wasn't fair to only get one.  House of the Dead 2, Jurassic Park.  I love shooting games.  XP

Monday - Queen Mary and Aquarium of the Pacific
John took me to Long Beach, CA.  Took a self-guided tour of the ship and then the Ghost and Legends tour.  The ship was absolutely amazing.  I wish I could see it in its prime.  The Ghost and Legends wasn't QUITE as scary as I thought it would be.  Then off to the Aquarium.  O.M.G. There were so many kids under the age of 10.  Like, and impossible amount, lol.  One of the characters came out and got swarmed by kids.  John thought he lost me at the ray petting pool.  He turned around and I wasn't there.  When he found me, he said I act like a 5 year old.  XP  I was at that pool for close to 20 minutes at least, lol.  Went out to dinner with his grandparents and family to a mexican restaurant.  Had relatively real mexican food for the first time, lol.

Tuesday - Disneyland
Longest wait was 45 minutes so it wasn't too bad.  My favorite ride was Indiana Jones.  We got front row for quite a few rides (mostly by luck).  Got to ride a Segway.  I suck at that, lol.  John absolutely loved it, he wants to buy one.  I made a deal with John:  if he pays for tickets, I pay for food.  And I stuck to that.  I didn't want him spending a lot of money on me while I was there.  

Wednesday - Hollywood and La Brea Tar Pits
Hollywood was smaller than I expected... by a lot.  Got to see some sights though.  Then off to lunch with John's family.  Went to a Japanese restaurant in LA.  Figured out John doesn't like Japanese food.  Matt and I were happy with our sushi, lol.  Then off to the La Brea Tar Pits with John and his mom.  I was literally like a kid in a candy store there, lol.  All those bones and stuff!  I hate the smell of tar though.  I need to convince my grandmom to let me work there for a summer.

Thursday - Getty Villa
Have I mentioned lately how much I love all things Roman?  The guy who built it based it off the Villa de Papiri in Heculenum.  It was destroyed by Mount Vesuvius.  I took so many pictures there.  The gardens and architecture were absolutely amazing and breathtaking.  There was a lot of Roman, Greek, and Etruscan art there too.

Friday - Zuma and Malibu Pier
John took me to Zuma beach in the morning.  Yeah... I don't stand very well in strong waves.  I clung to John the whole time.  I felt bad, because he wanted to go farther into the water but I couldn't stand there.  Went back to his house for a bit and then left for the Malibu Pier to watch the sunset.  When it got dark, we went on the ferris wheel, which really freaked me out for some reason.  I hate heights.  >_<  I got used to it after a bit though.

Saturday - Universal Studios Hollywood
It was John's dad's company picnic.  So many kids...  My favorite ride was the Mummy ride, even though Matt and John made fun of me for screaming a lot.  We were in the front row, lol.  For the Jurassic Park ride, I was in the middle.  It was a bad move... all the water drips were down the center, lol.  Overall, it was fun.  The park was small though.

Then it was off to dinner and the airport.  Ate at BJ's, which apparently is a brewery too.  I cried on the way to the airport.  I really didn't want to leave John.  Security really didn't check my stuff because I guess they saw that I was crying, lol.  I had to check my bag because the plane didn't have room.  They started checking after Zone 5 and I was sitting in Zone 6.  The two people sitting next to me were heading to the Bahamas through Philly.  They were roommates at Cal Poly and made it a point to go vacation together for a week every year.  The guy sitting next to me on the plane was Asian too and heading to Ohio.  He was asleep before the plane even took off, lol.  I missed the train since I had to get my checked bag so I took a taxi for $28.50 to the Drexel dragon where my grandparents were waiting for me.

I tried so many different foods while I was there.  In-n-Out was really good and so was Jimmy Deans (both burger places).  Jimmy Deans had really good fries.  So did Carl Jr.  I was in love with Carl Jr fries.  XP

I really didn't want to leave John.  It was almost torture, not seeing him for the 10 weeks I worked at Drexel for STAR.  I was so happy to see him again.  *sigh*

<b>Edit</b>
John just told me I forgot to mention this.  I learned how to pump my own gas.  XP"

There were 4 shower stalls and we'd much rather shower in the company of friends.  So we chatted during the shower.  Today it was me, Sahithi, Steph, and Anna.

I've been spending a lot of time with John.  He leaves for CA tomorrow.  We had a good cry for close to an hour.  It finally hit us that we were gonna be apart for 2 months.  After he left, I cried a bit when talking to Steph and Sahithi but Steph is going through the same stuff as me, so it made me feel a bit better that I wasn't so alone.

Oh, Tuesday night = death by boredom.  We ran around trying to find something to do.  Even tested how many steps and jumps it took from Anna/Steph's room to Sahithi/Ran's room.  XP

Then we played 2 rounds of Egyptian Ratscrew and 1 round of Bull.  I won all three rounds.  XP

Chinese 101 is pretty good.  I gave myself away already but that's okay.  I don't know the pinyin system so I'm good.  The teacher's cool and the class is cool even though I'm the only frosh/soph.

Met up with Rel in NYC and walked around with John and Liz to get free comics on free comic book day.  Took the subway and didn't get lost.  Went to Union Square and St. Mark's.  Had Pinkberry for the first time and really liked it.

Then off to Medieval Times.  OMG, no words can describe it.  The food was really good too.  Vegetable soup, garlic bread, half a roast chicken, spare rib, half a baked potato, and apple pastry.  I ended up giving John half of my chick, my spare rib, and half my potato while stealing his pastry.  XP

The announcer was introducing everyone and birthdays and such and when he got to Drexel University, we all gave a loud cheer.

My section was the yellow knight.  He ""won"" the joust, but then the green knight snuck up behind him and killed him.  John bought me a dragon too.  ^_^  I love this boy.

Sunday = Liz, Aakruti, Melodie, and I went to UPenn and animal watched for Bio 123 lab.  Stopped by Bubble House for some bubble tea.  After taking pictures of animals, we just climbed trees.  Pictures are up on facebook.  XP

Saw Eurydice today at the Wilma Theater.  It was okay, but made me miss John a whole lot (he stayed home to study for physics).  It was mostly a story about lost love and stuff.

Chem 103: Intro to Orgo - Omg, it will be the ban of my existence... So far, we're only doing the naming though, so it should be okay.

Univ 241: Modern Medicine - There are 7 of us frosh and 1 soph and the rest are 3rd years.  Um... all the third years are Indian.  XP  We're gonna have a fun time in that class.  Our teacher = the CoAS Dean.  She wants to learn our names.  XP

I started my work in the lab with Dr. Felice Elefant this week.  I'm so excited!  I got my lab key yesterday.  ^_^  I learned how to make fly food and use the autoclave.  Should be an interesting term."

Sometimes I'm afraid he's just gonna wake up one morning and be like, ""why am I dating her?"" and leave me for someone else.  Or he'll see that I can't do anything (cleaning, cooking, i'm not athletic, etc) and it'll annoy him.  I don't know, I just feel like he'll see me for how horrible of a person I am.  There's so much wrong with me, maybe it'll end up pushing him away.  It's not like I get dressed up every time i see him or make sure i at least look decent.  I randomly roll out of bed and that's how he sees me.  *sigh*  Maybe I'm just being too paranoid.  I think he really loves me.  Maybe he doesn't and just thinks he does.  He misses me, that's a good sign... right?</lj-cut>"

"event","So I've been having nightmares lately.  Not sure why.

<lj-cut text=""Dream Numero Uno"">So I dreamed that the Villaran twins, Florina, Pratik, Somil, and someone else I forgot came to visit Drexel.  Drexel was having this seminar and people take tests afterwards based on their majors.  I was walking the hallways with Mark and they showed up.  Mark and I were talking about our bio labs at the time.  The Lenape peeps stole my jacket and pissed me off, so I walked away, then I had to walk back in there to fetch my coat.

The I dreamed that I walked into John's room and Ashley Cooke was there.  She somehow blackmailed John into being with her and doing stuff (like sexual stuff) with her.  In the dream, the blackmailed stuff was never explicitly said, but I think it had to do with hurting me.

So I keep telling John it didn't matter, not to do anything, but then he kept acting indifferent towards me.  Someone in the dream said ""I hate you.""  Ryan and Mark had to drag me out of the room.

Then I stormed back into the room and found John and Ashley in bed.  Her head was on his chest and he had his arm around her.  I flipped out and Ashley left for the bathroom.  Then I turn around and Pauline bounces out of the bed.  I look around confused and Sean pops up and says ""yeah, Ashley was there before Pauline.""  So Ryan and Mark pull me out of the room yet again and this time, Pauline comes with us.  Sean just kinda disappeared.  Ryan said ""I can see why he's doing it"" meaning he can see why John's doing what he's doing.  Which pissed me off even more, so Pauline and I walked away to talk.  That's when I woke up.  </lj-cut>

That dream was Wednesday morning, when I went to sleep after registering for classes.

I had another dream today when I took a nap.  <lj-cut text=""Dream Numero Dos"">I remember Pauline and Elyssa from my dream.  And some random dream people, but I don't remember faces.  We infiltrated a school.  I remember shooting people with arrows because they were in our way.  But the dying people were more like cartoons and fake people than real people.

Then someone said someone was coming so we split up.  I was in the room with the person we were afraid of.  I came out of my hiding area (wall with a square hole I crawled through) and shot him with a bow and arrow.  The guy was shot in the heart and didn't die.  He pressed a button and alarms went off.

I ran out of there and met up with Elyssa and another dream person.  Elyssa was like ""Did I do something to set it off?""  I didn't have the heart to tell her I did it.  Then the dream ended.  I just remember a sense of panic and fear, because we knew they knew there were people who didn't belong at the school and they were gonna kill us if they found us.</lj-cut>"

"event","O...M...G...  John, Ryan, and Mark = the most amazing people in the world.  They DID scheme for valentine's day.  John cooked pasta, Ryan and Mark decorated Mark's common room.  Mark sang a song for Pauline.  Elyssa was waitress and Sean was waiter.  They tried to do the whole 5-star restaurant thing.

John came to get me (after I had to ask Lisa about outfits) and he was all dressed up in a nice shirt and sports coat.  Us girls ended up being stuffed in Pauline's room while they schemed some more.  They tried to stall so they brought us to the elevator with our eyes closed and stuff.  Then back to Mark's room.

Omg, when they let us look, all three of us just kinda froze and we almost died.  It was so cute!  I love those boys, I really do.  But I love mine most of all.  ^_^

That was thursday.

Friday = Cyrano Opera
We got all dressed up and took pictures.  It was actually a good show, but in French (with subtitles).  XP  John really liked me in the dress (my facebook profile picture).  Went with John, Luke, Sean, Pauline, Mark, Melodie.  Lent Melodie my dress and it actually turned out nice.

Saturday = King of Prussia
Went because the boys needed to buy clothes.  Mark ended up buying stuff while John didn't.  Went with Pauline, John, Mark, Karen, Luke, and Eugene.  The minute we walked into the mall, Karen, Pauline, and I saw pretty prom dresses and we just HAD to try them on.  We all tried on these amazing looking dresses.  The guys weren't too happy at first, until we came out in them.  ^_^

Sunday = family came
Went to lunch in chinatown with Dad, Grandmom, Aunt.  They met John and liked him.  John said it wasn't too awkward meeting my family, aside from the obvious language barrier.

Went to Eastern Mountain Sports with John and he bought a jacket (finally!), gloves, and 3 t-shirts.  Yay.

So I got my English paper back today.  This is the English paper i wrote before my bio final (and BSed) and revised during Valentine's Day.  Got a 23/25.  XP  The last paper, i got an 80% on and I worked my butt off.  My teacher told me i did a good job as I walked out the door.

Oh, I've decided I want to be a Biology major with a History minor during the school year.  When everyone else is on co-op or in class over the summer, i'll be working on my second minor... English.  XP  God I hate english, but with all the classes I want to take, I only need around 3 more classes to get the minor, so I thought, might as well."

He got me this SOFT teddy bear with a heart and a scented candle (mango) and a singing card.  He wrote a note in the card and it was just so cute.  It seriously made me cry... happy tears, of course.  And when I tried to explain the card to diana on the phone, I almost started crying again.

I love him.  I really do.

He's scheming something for tonight (when he gets out of class).  I don't know what, but I have a feeling him, Mark, and Ryan are scheming together.  -_-"

"event","So about how I've had a boy since 1.7.08.  Yeah... Same boy I said I wasn't gonna date, but things changed. (obviously)

I think I've fallen hard for this boy.  I really do.  We've only been dating 3 weeks, but I can't even imagine life without him anymore.  I know I sound like such a girl right now.  I also know I was totally against ""love"" in high school, but it's college and I think I have found it.  May it be first love or real love, I'm not sure.

Over the weekend, John told me he thinks he loves me.  I just gave him a deer in headlights look for a while.  XP  When I told him earlier that I think I love him, he told me not to expect him to say it because of certain reasons.  So I definitely wasn't expecting him to say it anytime soon.  And then I had this huge grin on my face that wouldn't go away.  XP  He was like, you look happy.

I don't know.  Hopefully things keep going the way they do and hopefully it's not just infatuation.  As of now, I wouldn't mind spending forever with this boy, even though forever is a long time."

"event","So Diana came to visit Drexel this weekend.  Friday was pretty chill.  Didn't do much on friday.  Mostly just hung out and watched Knocked Up.

We moved 5 mattresses into John's room and all slept there.  One huge massive sleep over.

Saturday = Chinatown for Peking Duck and then clubbing later that night at Club 27.  John was my partner for clubbing (duh) and I still can't believe it was his first time dancing.  He was pretty good.  Like, I couldn't tell he's never danced before.

Everything hurt after clubbing.  XP  Like, hips, knees, feet.  It was really cute, because John massaged my hip for me, because my stupid ball-and-socket joint really hurt.

Omg, I have such an adorable boyfriend.  ^_^  He was staring at me once and I was like ""why are you staring at me?  what?""  He was like ""I was getting lost in your eyes.""  I was about to die.  XP  And he keeps calling me beautiful and stuff.

Oh, so before we went clubbing, we took so many pictures.  A lot of them are hilarious.  The boys like the ones of me, Pauline, and Elyssa posing in poses that make it look as if we're kissing.

Oh!  AND...  Arjun bought a turtle from Chinatown.  His name is Eeyore and we need to take care of him."

I think we all would have jumped her if she wasn't friends with some of the Drexel boys.  It was still pretty fun."

<center><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/S/SE/SEL/Selo12394/1198013630_truecolors_blue.png""><br/>You are BLUE! Blues' lives are ruled entirely by emotion and a drive to be kind to everyone indefinitely. They are helpful and generous, never hesitating to lend someone a hand or put in a kind word. Blues don't understand the concept of hate, for they are romantics and givers who believe that everyone has a right to be treated fairly and justly. Blues are very friendly and sensitive, just the ones for asking advice or having a shoulder to cry on. Blues are very creative and have artistic minds, seeing beauty and expressive opportunity in everything around them. They are flexible and never stay the same way for very long, always adapting their feelings to the situations they may encounter. Like Oranges, they thrive on having many people around them but this due to a desire to help everyone and show passion rather than sole conversing. Blues have great intuition and values of harmony and always making the right choice. Hence, Blues naturally have a strong sense of justice and never hesitate to point out the wrongs or cruelties of others' actions. Blues spread peace and love wherever they go, and they come out and say whatever they're thinking plain and clear. Blues are easily offended by anything mean-spirited, and are often seen as too soft due to their giving, selfless personalities. They're simply bent on equality and doing all you can for others.<br/>Take this <a target=""quizilla"" style=""color:rgb(0,0,0)"" href=""http://quizilla.com/redirect.php?statsid=17&url=http://www.quizilla.com/users/Selo12394/quizzes/What+Are+Your+True+Colors%3F"">quiz</a>!<br/>

Slept a lot after that too.
Wednesday (today) = I feel terrible.  *kicks Eugene*  Stupid cold.  But on the bright side, I got my grades.  3.75 GPA!!!!!

Introduction to Honors Program = B+ (stupid class screwed me over... bah! Philosophy.. >_<)
Calculus I = A (huge shocker for me)

"event","Yeah, so now that I'm home, I can scrutinize my first term at Drexel University.

I was so worried before college that I would get the same experience as everyone else.  I kept hearing stories about how people missed home and weren't making friends that easily, evil roomies and horrible classes.

The year started off AMAZING!  Reconnected with awesome friends from orientation (who just kept getting better and better) while making new friends too.  Went through quite a bit of boy drama and came out with a cuddle buddy.  (Yeah... still trying to figure that one out.  XP)  All my Drexel peeps are more than friends now.  We're like a nice, big, happy family.  ^_^

Classes weren't too bad.  They were not too hard and I found people who could help me if I got stuck anywhere.  I'll definitely pull off an A/B in all my classes.

College in Philly is absolutely the best.  I was iffy about going to school in the city, but I'm so happy I made that decision.  Even though we STILL had times where we were like ""i'm bored, what am I supposed to do?"" we still did a lot of stuff around the city (as shown in pictures).

Today was kinda depressing.  I left.  People left.  I'll miss Michael Smith.  :(  I seriously started crying once his taxi pulled away.  I really WILL miss him, but I hope he has a great time at LSU.  ^_^

I have done so many new things since getting to college.  Ice skating, clubbing, randomly running around Philly at night, etc.  I can't wait until next term starts.  ^_^"

I just had to yell at Eugene because he's being a freakin' idiot.  THIS is the reason why I won't go out drinking.  I don't have to make people take care of me.

I want to just shake some sense into them, except I can't... because they're drunk.  And I'd like to believe that they're better people when they're sober (even though they might not be).  I don't know.  I'm happy I stopped getting drunk calls from peeps from home, but now I'm getting drunk calls from peeps in Calhoun (dorm across from mine).  

Next term, I think I'm gonna stop staying places past a certain time.  That way, I wouldn't have to deal with the drunk people.  (yeah yeah, even though I say that now, I know I'm not gonna pay attention.)

Last weekend = dealing with drunk people
This weekend = dealing with drunk people

Why the hell am I always dealing with drunk people?  Half of them aren't even from my own dorm!  -_-  *kicks alcohol*  Why are college students so stupid?  Correction, why are college FRESHMEN so stupid?!  Oh yeah, because this is technically the first time they can drink away from parents.  Well, big deal!  Grow up, people.  Ug..."

It was so much fun.  I'm getting better.  It was my 2nd time ice skating EVER.  Funniest fall was Michael and me.  He fell first and i tripped over him so I ended up on top of him.  XP

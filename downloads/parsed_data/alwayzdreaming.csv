"event","I am slacker when it comes to recognizing myself. I try so hard to not be seen as a self centered person that I tend to loose myself pretty easily in the passing of the every day life.  This school year is going to be way rough, emotionally, physically, and scholastically. I have fifteen credits this year, Core Humanities 201 (which is a bitch that seems sooo unnecessary), Criminal Justice 101, Criminal Justice 222, Social Psychology 261, and Sensation and Perception 405.  Its a huge load to take on and basically all of them rely on just tests, which i tend to choke on and a lot time consuming reading.  
I work 23 hours a week now which isn't that much, but it kinda is being that its all monday through friday while going to school. On top of all of that Tri Delta is way more time consuming than its ever been, for the past week and a half it has been school, work, and tri delta, all from 8am till about 1030 pm. 
On top of that I was sick again and in the hospital the first week of school with an ulcer and an upper respiratory infection. Its been a disaster. On the mental level I have just not been feeling too great, I have been walking through the day as a zombie numb to everyone and everything around me. 
I have realized I am too afraid to put myself out there for anyone in anyway, Im having a tough time dealing with making just friends because of how many friends I have lost this summer, all of the friends I lost were entirely my fault.  I feel I just had an emotionally break down and tried my best to push everyone away when I was falling, and now that I have almost hit rock bottom I have no one here to help pick me up, and I have only me to blame. 
 I am terribly afraid of feeling that I need someone. I can't risk another loss to me mentally. I met a guy last week, he is awesome and really mature probably because he is 23 but he is real respectful. We have spent two nights together and he hasnt tried anything but kissing. I have been pretty excited about him but I have a bad feeling about this guy for some reason and I have made the ultimate decision to just stop talking to him now and not risk another chance of getting hurt.  I need to just take things one at a time and any type of relationship just doesn't seem worth it right now. I think ill be single for a really long time. I don't think anyone wants to deal with my baggage or pick up my pieces anymore. Why things have to be so hard I will never know. I need to clear my mind and my life and figure out what makes me happy, and make sure that the thing that makes me happy is healthy."

"event","Growing up is so hard.  I am learning this summer that changing into your own person is probably the most strenuous thing, you are faced with the obstacle of figuring out who exactly you want to end up to be but also figuring out who and what can outlast your cycle.   I don't really know if I am proud of myself right now, I am trying so hard to fight all of the petty aspects of my life and I hate to say that I give into it all to often.  I see the person I want to be and at times she feel so far away, I can see the challenges that face me and all of the decisions I have to make and I get scared, I sometimes take a step back or I just freeze, afraid of what is to come.  I need to get more courage,  I need to learn to stand for what I believe in and to trust my instincts.  To know when to keep that fight I know I have deep down inside or to let it out and stand strong.  Thats my problem I feel like every decision even the simple ones I make are wrong and I second guess myself far too much.  I need to learn to stick with things. I also need to learn to see the good in people and know that there are people that will be there and want to be there.  Kelby will be good for me, I need to stop chasing him away."

"event","So today I wrote a song for you 
Cause a day can get so long 
And I know its hard to make it through 
When you say theres something wrong 

So Im trying to put it right 
Cause I want to love you with my heart 
All this trying has made me tight 
And I dont know even where to start 

Maybe thats a start 

Cause you know its a simple game 
That you play filling up your head with rain 
And you know you are hiding from your pain 
In the way, in the way you say your name 

And I see you 
Hiding your face in your hands 
Flying so you wont land 
You think no one understands 
No one understands 

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head 
And your throat is aching but you swear 
No one hurts you, nothing could be sad 
Anyway youre not here enough to care 

And youre so tired you dont sleep at night 
As your heart is trying to mend 
You keep it quiet but you think you might 
Disappear before the end 

And its strange that you cannot find 
Any strength to even try 
To find a voice to speak your mind 
When you do, all you wanna do is cry 

Well maybe you should cry 

And I see you hiding your face in your hands 
Talking bout far-away lands 
You think no one understands 
Listen to my hands 

And all of this life 
Moves around you 
For all that you claim 
Youre standing still 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
You are moving too 
I will move you"

"event","For the first time in what I feel like two years I am happy with myself.  This time it's different and I know I'm going to stay happy, mainly it's because this time I am not happy because I have a new man of the moment but because I have things going for me.  I finally stopped talking to Matt all together as a friend, as family, as anything I now want to lock him in my past and never speak to him again, at least not for a year or so.  I feel someone guilty for my decision to lock him out of my life, after all I was angry, confused, and upset when Adam did it to me but I now realize more than ever that he had to do that for him.  It feels like pushing Matt out of my life has helped with my views upon everyone.  I just cant believe I kept myself tortured for so long, I didn't deserve any of it and I am just ecstatic that I finally gave up something that was just a constant weight for me. 

Since I gave up on everything with Matt I have been able to live my life the way I want when I want it.  Now I am experiencing a true social life that is not clouded by me having to lie to matt about it, take too long, or be somewhere he would disapprove of.  When I explain all of these things I cant help but see how pathetic I was for so long and how mentally and physically abused I was getting.  I never thought I would be the type a girl that would bend over backwards to be around something that would make her flinch or cringe up when he was angry.  I do believe that Matt will have a negative effect on my views towards guys but I know that I just have to take my time and not jump into anything too quickly.  Its amazing to see that some of my truly great friends are still there even though I neglected them for so many years.  Justin and i have been hanging out and since he broke up with his girlfriend we are able to chill and not have to worry about anyone flipping out.  He has a great set of friends too that I am becoming close with as well and it is nice to be around people that are motivated and even enrolled in college.  

I have a great new job, I am now a full time nanny.  I met the family at the day care I used to work with and the approached me with the idea that I could come and be their full time nanny they pay me more than I got payed there, its only one little fourteen month old and they allow me to take her places.  We have classes set up for her in the summer, a set day for wild waters, and they got me a membership to their country club so I can take her up to the pool and order lunch.  Yesterday I got paid to do my homework, watch TV, and take a nap.  It was great also the family has close relatives in Italy and they have already mentioned that when they go on their annual trips I would be attending as well. It really is a great job and for just the seven days I worked I have made 440 dollars, and those arent full days.  During the summer I will be making around fifteen hundred plus dollars a month!  

Romantically speaking there really isn't much there but I like that.  I have the matt from lambda chi I hang out with and he is fun, maybe we would look into something official in the summer but as of now our schedules are wak.  There is also Ben, Justins friend. He is good looking, very intelligent, and motivated.  We have a good time together, its only been going on for a couple of days so I will see where it goes.  He is a great catch and it kind of intimidates me, I dont think i would be smart enough for him.  He is a civil engineer major and pulls a 4.0 easily.  Also he has an incredible body, like literally a defined six pack, its the first one I have came across. So thats about it in that area. 

Overall I am pretty happy and optimistic. I know that in a few short months everything will be great and I will be happy."

"event","These past couple of months have soared by.  I am initiated into tri delta and it seriously feels like i just signed my bid card yersterday. I would be happy about this fast paced year if it wasn't for the fact that I just cant keep up with it.  My grades are terrible, honestly Im going to be surprised if I keep my millinium and im not put in bad standings.  The thing is I get in these moods where I want to achieve and try really hard but I just cant find the time, none the less the energy to do all of it.  Today I was cleaning my room and doing my laundry for the first time in seriously like a month and I found a glass that had rotted so much there was like a green slime mold forming, I have been cleaning my room for about two and a half hours total and if someone were to walk in they would still think it was extremely messy, i feel like i cant get my homework done until my room is clean and then when i finally start getting to the homework i am supposed to be doing i dont even know where to start because I am that far behind. 

Aside from being completely helpless when it comes to school i feel lonely. I miss Cameron so much its not even funny,  i never realized how much he affected me as a person, i feel different and weird without him.  We cant really talk too intensly either because for some strange reason he has absolutely no service anywhere on his stupid campus. I miss having tons of friends in all the same classes as me that used to keep me on track, i would go to class because if i didnt i would catch shit from them, i would do my homework and study for tests because of that competitive nature. 

Socially I am enjoying life, its weird having tons of friends but really no close friends.  I have never been the person to just have that but I am enoying it, at times I get a little lonely but it keeps things simple and although i shouldnt view relationships as a stressful situation it is.  Guys are not a constant in my life at all, ive dated a couple of guys but none of which that i would like to stick around, its kind of just something to fill up some of my time that i really dont have. 

Overall life is good, hard, and stressful.  I dont think ive been this happy and excited though, next semester will rock."

"event","School started and it was completly different than any other. This time i didnt go shopping for hours looking for what clothes i want to define myself by, ill be wearing nothing, new just clothes and i wont really care. I didnt go get new pens or note books and im not cleaning my room frantically organizing and promising a new sense of organization and goals to myself. Its almost like its such a fresh start already i dont have to try and force it to be. Im ready to work, i know its going to be hard. 

Summer was different from any other summer i have ever had. I cant even say if it was good or bad it was just a sureal expierience. Its all a blur of emotions and events and over all im pretty happy its weirdness has ended. I honestly look back on it and wonder if it all happened for a reason if it was learning expieriences. I had to say good bye to my best friends and accept my fate  of staying at UNR. I dated a guy completely different than the type i go for and it was a really different type of relationship. I dont really think it was good nor bad but I guess it made me realize a lot about people, maybe things i didnt really even want to know or want to accept. All i know is i want to wait a long time before i get into any type of relationship again, fortunately I completly forgot how to play the game or hit on guys, and really i think im way too tired to even care. 


So I joined a sorority. It's the weirdest thing actually, im not the type to go do something that bold. Krista kind of drug me along to rush and weirdly enough we got into two different houses so it almost defeats the purpose. I dont really know how i feel about it yet, I like it and all but the idea of it is starting to freak me out already and its only been five days. Well I guess ill figure it out but still i just thought that was weird. I need to get more serious about class to i mean after all i am writing this, but i absolutly hate every aspect about woman's studies. I hate the people in the class, i hate the location of it, i hate the material, i hate my seat, and i really hate my teacher. getting an A in this class is going to be tough mainly because i really cant focus, i do try but its really distracting to have a lab top i could just not bring it to class yet then it would go by wayyy too slow and it would be a risk to my health. I just saw someone pull out the same phone as mine and it was weird. Well college is pretty cool, i get off today at 10:45 and i plan on going home, eating, watching house, sleeping, going to the gym and then its up to the Lambda Khi frat to play root beer pong, i dont really know if its rootbeer pong or if thats just ""code"" for the flyers.....hmm i guess we will see. Oh another night of akward greek things."

Seriously it's bothering me I was in an amazing mood and when i found out I just got this big weird feeling in my chest. I shouldn't be upset I ended it, but seriously he started being bitter and ignoring me when I did so I didn't even get a chance to fix things or even fucking closure. Either of which would have been amazing but he was just too childish to grant me that respect. She's cute but not his type he doesn't need cute he may be all innocent looking on the outside but I know what he is really like. Ugh stupid I hate emotions. Has anyone ever seen the movie Eternal Sunshine for the Spotles Mind, I woud love to hit that procedure up. Im tired of caring or is it that i just think i do. No I do whatever I hope when he goes to Europe she ends it with him and once again he becomes a bitter bitch and drops the idea of her too. She fucking wears scene boy stripes, im talking horizontal thick stripes in that fuzzy like sweater in light blue and brown. She has blonde hair! why is it that when a guy moves on they get a girl with blonde hair? Maybe i was just too much trouble and they made association with the color of my hair?

I have just been sitting in a land where I think about the past,read old papers, look at pictures, and listen to old music that reminds me of things. On another hand I have been searching for more music and getting so much new stuff because the more I explore certain situations the more I want to find something a little more fitting. 

I have an innocent crush on a boy at work. I seriously miss the simple little crushes on a boy, you know just a boy not someone who you hope will turn into something, or a big ball of lust just a crush. Nothing more. The most I hope to come out of this is hanging out after work, getting some food, and laughing, hey maybe a kiss but im not expecting anything.

It's a weird place and the decorations consist of vegetables that look like they are tripping on acid but other than that most of the people are cool, the food is good, and forty hours of working a week really helps at this point since my graduation money is starting to wither away to nothing but i am impressed that i made it last this long. 

Summer has been a bundle of weird things so far. I feel strangely depressed but i think its just because i know all my close friends are all going away and im staying here. I think ill be able to make myself happy here though i'm just going to seriously study and study, then transfer next year to a new place. 

Why is it that when you can't get someone out of your mind you think you see there car everywhere. I am truly missing him now I really thought i wouldnt but i do. I miss him so much, i miss having my best friend there to walk me through everything, i miss even walking him through stuff. I just want him to talk to me and im just stepping back and waiting on him to come through but i am afraid he wont. Im going to try my best to not text him or try and call him and maybe if im lucky not think of him either. I know that one wont happen but i refuse to try once again in a desperate atempt to talk to him. I know its now his choice of if he wants to communicate. I just wake up hoping ill hear from him and just know how he is doing.

I know thats probably how it is for most but I have this bad habbit of when one person lets me down I find problems with everyone else. I hate being so so I cant even find the word but its making me itch. I truly am upset I am, and you can see it if you know me well. Cameron literaly took one look at me sitting in my government class and I think I was acting quite normal but I then get a text saying ""Are you okay? I know we havent talked in a while but Im alwayz here"". It made me feel better. I know he will always be there and the unique thing about him is I always want him there. But heres the thing Cameron brings all of my emotions out, ones I didnt even know I had burried inside of me. so whenever our talks happen its always an emotional week. 

I cant help but be mad at him, and i dont know why it is. I think its just that I never expected him to give up so easy. Its easy for him to avoid phone calls, or texts nice ones bad ones any of them. Lying piece of shit, you wont always be there when i need you.

Im not meaning small town as in biggest little city in the world im meaning show low, arizona small, 8,000 people tops. I was searching for a long lost friend from the town i used to live in, and i swear i had never seen so many people with titles for their myspaces like ""a walk through hell is what im doing"", ""I was fine before you came along"", ""you are the only girl who makes me like my life"".etc.... it was really depressing and i felt highly greatful that I only lived there for fifth grade, maybe i would have been even more screwed up. Anyway from the ages of 5-to about 10 I had an older step sister, we were incredibly close, had random kid fun and then our parents got divorced and that was the last time we saw each other. I was literally talking about her to someone yesterday and today i get home to find that she has messaged me on myspace. It was a total mind blower not only because i was just thinking about her, and now she is 22 and engaged but why did it never occur to me to search for her myself. ha. weird world,i really hope that we become close again and i can have somewhat of an older sister to talk to. That would be great to attend her wedding and get ruinited and all of that. 

Today I felt like Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, cold and really really tired, i didnt get up till seven so that caused me to look and feel bad. When I came home for second period I took a nap and woke up with a migrane. Then when i got back to school everyone was running into me, like everyone possible. I mean Alexander deffinitly had it worse than me but i was having a mini piss fit in my head. 

I feel like getting back in touch with all of those friends that were really cool to hang out with but you kind of lost over time. I leave soon im accepting that but i have time to get in touch with people i miss. Im ready to start getting my life back on track with the gym, homework and cleaning. Lately ive been really good with it, ive been doing all my homework plus a little extra every night and today i went on the costco run for the student store which was an extra thing i signed up for and i got that done by 4. When normally i would have totally blown off it until like 8. but yey life lets get back on track!"

"event","People always tell me I'm strong and i hate that inside i know im not. I can't handle things anymore and the fact that im only 17 and ready to give up on people sucks. Why is it that things all around you can be perfect, im into a good college that is giving me $21,800 a year, I am pretty good in school, my friends are back and im closer than ever with them, I have a great boyfriend, and i get to go to New York in two weeks, but still with him like this i cant enjoy any of it. Somehow he has this incredible way of controlling me even after being broken up for three months, with one witty sentence he speaks it digs into my skin and i cant help but cry, laugh, scream, and just die. I am aware of it but still i let this bitch who hit me control my emotions and tear apart my heart. Seriously a sophomore you have to date a sophomore to justify yourself, wow you are cool. You know I am aware of the fact that i am just as lame as him to say these things but i cant help it at all. Then again im not going to say this to anyone but this live journal community so eh i dont feel as pathetic. Even though i am i am a cliche girl who still has feelings for a man who beat her up. This once again brings me to the realization about how i am not strong at all. He got exactly what he wanted, a life, an easy girl friend, and my heart break. I hope he is happy, yet i can almost gaurentee that he is not. I hope he is, this pain he is making me feel is so much more unbearable than anything i have yet to feel and i wouldnt wish it upon anyone even him. In this incident there is no bigger person we are both still sitting here rolling the dice to play a game that has no definition of winning, i dont think either of us knows exactly how to accomplish the victory. i guess mine will be when i am over him and i can sit in the same room as him and not cry. That would be fabulous untill then I am going to go treat myself to a new DVD series, a bunch of junk food, and a great cry."

"event","I used to write in a journal everyday and that was freshman year, i have no idea what I wrote about did i really have that much going on in my mind? Well maybe i did and i also had the time to do it, I know im not working, or have an emensly hard schedule but it still feels hard to find time for myself, meaning being alone and not around anyone. Senior year is going okay but the thing is it doesnt feel any different its only a game of anticipation seeing the gown ordering forms and everthing like that, i just want to get out of school go to college. Now that i think about it i wrote so much as a freshman because nothing was happening but everyday thins, i hate writing about things now because it hurts and letting people in is hard for me now. I know i have good friends that will listen and be there for everything and anything but its just after a year of being in a relationship that i was so selfishly sucked into i feel a little awkward leaning on people that i neglected. This break up is hard and its weird. I remember with Cameron I just cried, i layed there and cried nothing else, for six days straight. Thats pathetic, i was 15. But with this one, the one that lasted very close to a year, the one where i spent every waking moment together, the one that i lost my virginity to, this one isnt hard at all, i dont find myself crying and I didnt even need a whole day of crying just a night and then it was over. I think it was the way it ended I always thought a deffinite ending would hurt more but i was wrong having that event that just spelt out the end really helped. Anyway it has been 2 weeks and 2 days since it has been over and it brings so many mixed emotions, i have  been finding life to be easier, school isnt has hectic and i have been doing noticibly better at it. Along with that i have been discovering new emotions, Its weird being with someone who you know is into you for all the right reasons and who is perfect to you and for you. Jumping into things quickly i know isnt the best idea but i know myself and i know that this isnt just something that means nothing."

"event","Okay so my head needs to start catching up with my heart or vice versa. like literaly what am i thinking, who am i thinking about seriously this sucks. Im in Hawaii right now and i thought it would clear my head but i think it added to this mixed up jumbled feeling because the heat and insects are sending me insane. So by being insane i can plot out my wedding or my last words things are coming as extremes in my head. Will someone slap me with reality soon please? And cameron could you not call me three times in a day and leave messages, matt will you not be a piece of shit, and josh stop being hot. Damn lust, damn love, and damn me. Thats pretty much all i can say as of now because i suck and cant keep the same feeling or beliefe for more than five seconds omg i just got so frustrated with myself why do i suck. REGRETS why are you there????????? Why cant i accept that shitty things you hate just happened and thats all, its because piece of shit people have to remind you everyday of them. People in general just suck i mean keep your opinions to yourself if they are going to make someone chew your ass out. Friends what are they? They seem to be the people that remind you of how much you suck and how they would live your life if they could live it, well guess what fuck you have a life of your own and you havent been too fantastic either Buddah. aeoirfaocnakews seriously i had to do that. Its not that i dont want to be in Hawaii its that i  dont want to be in this exact place im not the kind of girl who can take bugs being around me or heat. Jasons was fine, i was content in the hotel way of it i know im lucky to be here but i just need to come home, what am i coming home to though like i hope i am happy but i have leadership when i get home and i have realized that class is not me! how does everyone in that class find it a sanctuary when i see it as hell. What is wrong with me why cant i be suzzie high school smile and love life. I just need to embrace life as it comes not embrace what i had last year. Being stuck in the past is no way to live."

"event","I'm in an unusually good mood today. Spanish which normally sucks was an upper due to Matt throwing chex mix in my mouth and the teacher freaking out. Anyhow relationships are hard and i kinda always wonder if they really are supposed to be hard or if i'm doing something wrong. Anyway these past couple of weeks have been filled with fights but in hopes of mending (i think) Matt brought me an arrangment of roses and took me to olive garden for our five month, the next day wasnt good at all he is getting to the point again of being upset and moody i think i now see what cameron was dealing with when we were dating, though when it seemed that there was no way to fix it we came through and had an amazing evening yesterday. We went to target and messed around in the toy section for an hour then we went and played in the park, it was so fun i love being a kid momentarilly, after that we began talking about memories we had with each other from like the 8th grade we went and got ice cream and sat on the curb and ate it. It was marvelous. I see this being a good thing. This next semester im giong to have a GPA of a 3.6 or 3.8 which is getting me really excited because it will be my best GPA during high school. life is just getting good. 

I have really been into Friends the series, when i got in my car accident my mom bought me the first three sessons and i have now became addicted, im on season 7 and bought 8 yesterday. After i get through the seasons im going to have to watch the finale and cry just as hard as i did (probably harder) when it aired like 3 years ago. Anyhow i love it and it makes me  want a close knit of friends like that, also to grow up its weird i want to be like 25, i even wouldnt mind being 30. Weird. 

School needs to end, im tired of class and tired of seeing the same people. oh and im really tired of leadership. This summer should be great i dont want a job, hopefully my mom wont force me to have one. I want to relax, take day trips, read, tan, and travel. mmmmm summer."

We are done playing it, on saturday i hit black ice spun out and hit a pole, not just any pole its a huge one. Now my car is totalled, my ipod broke in the accidet and along with that my right arm and left leg is messed up. Junior year has been proven to majorly suck. Anyway i was alone in the accident but matt ran down to the accident and he rode in the ambulence with me. we have gone through so much shit together its crazy! When we first got there no one else was there so he started my hospitle papers it was weird but i can see how close we really are. Typing this is sucking i either type really slow with one hand or i type at a moderate speed yet my arm is killing me. Eh ill type more when im capable later"

"event","Anyway i got back from disneyland and it was amazing. It was a well needed trip our class got a lot closer and i loved the walk and talks, learning new things about people is always one of my favorite things. 

Anyway Saturday night was JA, that was okay i wasnt there with Matt and i realized thats basically the only person i would want to be there with. Caitlin and I just sat there wanting to go home. I went to matts after and just hung out. Sunday morning we went to leave for LA, i was so tired and the last thing i wanted to do was take a leadership trip, i just wanted to sleep. We didnt get to pick our seating arrangment on the plane but it turned out well, it was me and cameron in a row by ourselfs. I cuddled up with my blanket laid my head near camerons lap and fell asleep. We got to the airport and took a ride on the death van, i swear these drivers did not know what was up. When we go to our hotel my group of people were dead, instead of immidiatly jumping into the park we went to dennys to eat. After taht we all felt better and ready to go to the park. We went to our first team building act and it was kind of upsetting because i realized no one in the class really knew me. We went on a walk and talk and i went with nikki donahoe, supprisingly we are exactly the same and we had a great time walking around and just talking about things we couldnt talk to with oher people. The day was going on great untill dinner, me and angelina got in a fight she told me i had no morals. It really hit me hard because this new issue in my life is still a little new to me. I cried and walked off to our meeting place. We had another walk and talk and i went on it with kevin carter, we had an amazing time, we got ice cream sat and talked and then stayed at the park till it closed and just hung out. Someone said they saw us holding hands and thats weird i deffinatly wasnt, oh i got sherbert ice cream it was random i dont usually get that flavor but it was good. Monday morning cameron called me and asked me to breakfast. We went together then it was off to another long day. We went on a team scavenger hunt and basically just bonded with a lot of running. This day was so much better everyone was diverse and with different people so our group actually had more people and such. I went to dinner with kevin and then ended the whole day with cameron and it was actually a really great time. 

Yesterday i stayed home beacuse i was exhausted. It turned out well but contained a lot of drama. Matt got caught by his mom smoking and somehow i got involved he was in a horrible mood. Though it ended up that me and him just hung out and had a great time. I love him. 

Im in class right now, i love peer tutor i dont do shit. lol."

"event","So life is really weird, it seems to me that in a matter of two weeks or so my life has became something so different from what i ever expected it to be. I am happy though. There are rough times where i think it isnt supposed to happen this way but i think that happens with every situation. My myspace password has been cameron7 since me and cameron started dating it, i never changed it i always said that its so i wouldnt forget my password but it was just a little piece of him i have always kept, it sounds obsessive but yes as crazy as it sounds i always thought that in March we would be back together. Sure enough march is rolling around and he already has plans with his girl friend for that month. Its not that im upset its just that life didnt go the way i thought it would, who knows if it would be better or worse but either way they change has been made. Anyway going back to the myspace password ive finally changed it. I think a major piece of my heart is now moving on. It only took what 5 months? maybe longer. Whatever he is a memory and is my past now nothing more than a friend and not even a good one anymore. I think im slowly loosing all my good friends because of my new boyfriend and i am not saying this like its a bad thing i love him (omg am i cliche?) anyway life is good."

So these past days i have been on vacation i have had so much time to think. Overall i am thinking about how fast this year has gone by, not only did it breeze by but it graced me with so many new things. In a mere 12 months i have, gotten my permit, got my lisence, had a serious boyfriend, cheated on someone, fell in love, got my heart broken, drank, attempted stupid acts, done stupid acts, kissed new people, went to the east coast, failed a class, and overall i think i am finding out who i am. 

January started out so light hearted after having a crush on a boy for 11 months i started dating him, it was overall my first boyfriend. February i spent my first valentines day with a boyfriend and also got to go to a formal with a boyfriend.I also saw my best friend get her lisence. March i went to disney land for the first time and felt the pain of distance, i also got my permit(after failing the test). April i saw my boyfriend get his lisence and went to one of my first lame high school parties, i also got my first job as a life guard and started training. May i received my first assortment of roses from a boy and had my first day of work.June i received my drivers lisence and finished sophomore year.July i went to the east coast with my best friend, then went to spend east coast time with my boyfriend where we shared the fourth of july and our six month together, Harry Potter 6 came out and so did my heart it came out landed on the floor and stomped on, got dumped, recovered and had my first fling after the relationship. August i got in a back accident at work, finished my first season as a life guard, finished a fling and started junior year.  September i broke my foot, turned 16 and got paid a dollar to make out with a freshman. October i lost trust in people, attempted a stupid act, pulled myself together and met amazing people. November i dated a freshman, kissed a friend from eigth grade and just chilled. December i fell in love, went to florida and am now waiting. 

Now keep in mind all of this is the smallest summeration i could possibly do. Over all though it was a year, a year of laughs, cries, humor, love, hate, expierience and relization. I heard this quote it was like "" We must have to wisdom to remember and the courage to discover"" somehting like that it was on this ride at disney world. This year has brought me enough to know that i must remember i cant dwell i cant miss i just need to know the importance in remembering.

"event","For some strange reason i got depresesd. I cant even tell you why. Maybe its because I have 90 pages of harry potter 6 and for some reason i cant finish it. Along with that I have about 5 other books i bought just for my summer reading marathons. I didnt read at all this summer, reading used to be kind of a passion of mine. The moment my world crumbled in the summer i started all over. Its like i couldnt get myself to do somethings i did all the time. I just really want to finish a book and have fun with it not make it a chore. 

I was reading caitlins live journal and i was reading old fun times we used to have. I miss it terribly, i miss having a group of chick friends who would stay up all night doing nothing at all. It was such innocent fun. I miss having a group of guy friends that were set in stone, having the comfort of being able to say hey those are our boys. I miss me and camerons days of endless flirting. I miss him. I never knew he would feel this far away. I always had this image in my head that we would be together in some way forever. But now we are just a little nitch in eachothers past.His girlfriend asked angelina why we broke up....... how would you feel as a new girl friend if it was because we were getting too serious. Basically he's a fire in my heart that will never be put out. 

Chris is great though. He made me and my friends breakfast this morning. It was amazing. He is really good to me, he cleans my car, he never lets me get anything myself he does everything. But sometimes i dont know if the fact that he does everything is enough. It makes no sense its just i dont want to feel like im not giving him my all."

"event","Ok well this new layout for updating is really weird. Since my last entry everything really has taken a turn. Cameron is about to go out with the sophomore president, i swear they are both so lame i could vomit. Angelina has a boyfreind from spanish springs but of course this is angelina so she isnt too into him. Caitlin is talking to a guy. And i now have a new boyfriend. He is really cool but the main problem is he is a freshman, he's only 1 year and 4 months younger than me but it still is kind of weird at times. I mean im not going to stress over it though because if its making me happy and isnt illegal/damaging/wrong than why not go for it right? 

School is seriously so annoying. I want to go back in history and shoot the fag philosopher who invented trig, i have never been in a harder class than this and judging by that im deffinatly goign to safely say i am not taking calc. its kind of a bummer considered thats what i worked up to in the math area but you know im not a math wiz. Other than that my other classes arnt too bad, i would deffinatly be able to have a 4.0 but because of trig it will be hit down to like a 3.6.... lame. 

So new boyfriend, this is the freshman that i got paid a dollar to make out with at the dance. Yes i know romantic first meeting, i cant wait to tell our children. Jk im not having children. So he called me randomly one night and we started hanging out, turns out this boy that i thought would just turn into a friend became someone i liked. We casually dated for like a week then became official on November 1. I dont know if i really like the sound of an official thing though. I still have a really bad habbit of brigning up Cameron much too often and im trying to put chris (tahts the boyfriends name) in camerons old posistion and i havnt yet mastered the concept that people are going to play different roles in your life. Its just i miss him so much. Im scared though, im scared im going to randomly break up with him because i just think i rushed into it, you know the age this might get in the way eventually. 

Right now im talking to Ikiaka the ex flame and i dont know my mind is running around and is making up this fantasy wish that it would work out. We tried it and it didnt work and i need to accept the fact its over. And i need to realize i have a boyfriend so thinking about Ikiaka like that probably isnt the most respectful thing that could be done. 

I would post pictures of boyfriend but he looks really young :-(. i think im too lame for words."

"event","Well yesterday will probably remain in my life and the stupedest, lamest and worse day ever. I know that it might sound like no everything will be fine and i will forget about it but no i wont. So yesterday i found out that the one person i love with all my heart and my best friend of 9 years have been fooling around together. It was the worst pain i have ever felt in my life. I was choked i sit here and look around my room at pictures of me and her, pictures of me and him and i realize all the things that were once important in my life were a lie. I mean its like a movie i swear, things like this aren't supposed to happen in life, especially so soon im only 16 i mean dear God give it to me when im old enough to handle it in a manner that doesnt jepordize my health. I feel so stupid, i feel stupid for not seeing it and i feel stupid for believing them when they said nothing was happening. I feel stupid for the actions i took. No one should do that ive always thought that and i cant even begin to think of what caused me to do it. I hate always getting knocked down, i hate always being depresed i wish i could shrug this off but i cant. Seems like it would be so easy to brush it off too thats the funny part. i mean ok so your ex boyfriend is now with your best friend no biggie. Im over it. But its not that easy. It never will be, i will always be hurt over this weather i should or shouldnt be. In the long run it taught me a lesson one for myself and maybe one for people in the future. People are so completly stupid."

"event","Well last night i went to see Elizabethtown and although it wasnt quite what i expected i found it amazing. But yesterday all together was a great day. I mean I just felt this feeling that i havnt felt for a long time and i might sound a little weird when i say this but i feel like God is coming back into my life. I mean it was so weird monday i was talking to a friend of mine and telling him that i cant rely on religion too much because im busy and it takes too much effort. Which is true to completly trust God takes so much. So i say this and something that i had been preying about in the back of my head happened. I preyer actually came true right after i said i didnt believe in it anymore. It was then that i took it as a huge sign and i want to get back into that life style. 

Going back to the movie i saw it just made me look at life as so simple. I mean its easy to get let down by little things but isnt it so much easier to just say fuck it and be happy. Get up and do something that no matter how many times you do makes you laugh such as taking pictures and mcdonalds menus, doing cotton eyed joe or even sitting in the hot tub for hours looking at the moon. I mean right now i have a horrible grade in trig but the truth is i cant do anymore than im doing about it the only option i have is get motivated and do it, getting mad would be so easy but getting happy would be better. 

Basicaly im happy. 

Im in love with a freshman. lol"

"event","So anyway im honestly done with this. THere are no nice guys on this planet and when you find a nice guy alll it takes is a girl to turn him into the others. I honesly thought for a week i was talkign to someone who wasnt goign to hurt me, someone who wasnt going to turn his back on me. I was wrong. But i was right at the same time because this black part in my heart knew he was going to hurt me it was just a matter of time. It just sucks that it had to be so soon. Life is so predictable it hurts. 

And once again i had to drive that drive. the one that i drove so many times over the summer the one that i became comfortable with and would drive at 3:30 in the morning listening to music that made me giddy. But this time i had senses fail in my company instead of something like liz phair. Its weird how life can take a turn like that. I talked to cameron last night about it and he told me to come over because he wanted to help me for once and be there for me. I told him cameron i need you now but what now i need to not need you. I ended up going over there and once again driving a familiar drive brought me comfort this time. I love taking the left, then the right, then the left, then the right then the left and then the final left. I could probably drive it with my eyes closed with no problems. We sat on his kitchen floor and talked for hours, it was amazing. But i know myself and i know that isnt what i needed at all. It made me love him more. If that is even humanly possible. 

You know i hate waking up after a bad night, because for that groggy first minuite you spend awake you momentaraly forget about the things that had happened. Then it hits you like a pile of bricks and your heart stops and tears form. I talked to ikika online and a part of me wants nothing but to be with him, we talk well. We connected well. SOmething was supposed to be there. Now he is dating a freshman and i was all too late. I hate it. Maybe one day life will actually streighten out and things could be happy and make sense."

"event","So this past week was actually pretty tough. On Wednesday Cameron told me that he is taking the sophomore class president to prom and the main reason it upset me was because its like why, why did you need to tell me that? it was highly unecassary and caused me to be in a bad mood. Only because i sit and think about him and i notice how quickly he is slipping out of my life and i hate it. Like for example right now he signed online and of course he isnt going to talk to me, who knows why. I guess im honestly not that good of a person. Then today i went with his sister to go and eat and she took his car and when we were driving the cd playing was spill canvas on the way there and i was like cool, and then on the way back i heard the spill canvas song that wasnt number one but it said it on the CD, so i thought hmm it may be one of his mixes he has made so i look at the CD and its the Cd that the girl from new york sent him with hearts all over it but worst of all it was sent to him while we were still dating. COOOL. So basically Cameron is getting me upset. Wow what a shocker. 

Yesterday i had a lot going on. I went to subway with Amanda one of my friends from work. while i was on that side of town i went to see another friend from work, then i went with my christian neighbor to playful potter and to dinner. I like being around her shes like another mom, just a more spiritual side. I have been really missing my religious side alot latetly and i have no idea why. I dont want to get back in it because i honestly cant stand having to say ""well thats Gods plan"" everytime something makes me upset, i liek to have the chance to just be like ""it happened that way because life sucks"". But on the other hand i want to get religion another shot. We will see how that goes. After that i went to hang out with Nick, a guy from work who i had a little crush on and who happens to be Amandas twin brother. He is such a great guy, we hung out with my friends and honestly im starting to like him, we held hands and i just enjoyed the sweet guy thing where we just hold hands it doesnt lead to kissing nothing. 

Anyway i was talking to Ikiakas best friend last night and i found out why Ikiaka isnt talking to me. He has a girlfriend. Which kinda hurt me, why wasnt i ever good enough to be the girlfreind thats one of those constant questions that really hurts. So anyway he told his friends that he cant even just be friends with me right now because "" since we had such strong feelings for eachother and cared about eachother and it wasnt too long ago it would make his girlfriend uncomfortable to have us hanging out"" he said that Ikiaka will probably give me a call after his girlfreind, but i say fuck that. Hell no. That kinda upsetted me. 

Well this is a little late but i got my summer pictures together. Honestly it was a great summer.

"event","Im going to actually update this time i swear to myself. So starting is always difficult but im going to do it. School so far is blah like i honestly just have no motivation for it, luckily its really easy this year wich is kind of a let down i was looking foward to pushing myself and being proud, but it turns out most of my classes are easy, too easy. Poetry is a class i rarely go to because its first period yet i stil have a 100% in there, AP english is actually quit easy yet i see the test being a let down, History is a joke and the only classes that somewhat challenge me is trig and spanish. Basically i need to pull myself into kick ass mode or my GPA might suck. 

Other than school there is the boys....... its deffinatly a subject in my life i tend to fail. Im still hopelessly in love with cameron which is a very reasonable thing being im 16 and its only been two months since our break up. Although we broke up to stop fighting we still tend to do our share of arguing which seems like i got the fuzzy end of the lollipop stick. Im trying real hard to find a way to get over it, if that is possible. With Ikiaka i dont know what the hell is up, its just so complicated. I think its a dead end though. So in the guy area other than random hook ups there really is nothing. 

All and all thats it..... i have one tree hill season two ya ya ya!"

I hate it, it really seems so predictable it hurts its a never ending cycle of dissapointment it just seems that there are so many let downs, and it is sometimes just really hard to recover. 

Anyway i guess moving on to contintuing what happened in my life during summer... Well after getting over the Cameron thing i started to date around again. It was actually going great the guy that i liked was really cool. we got along well and we liked each other. But you know im gonna stop and go to a different tangent i hate how in my life happyness is always past tense. Actually i dont even know what im talking about i guess im excited for school to start because it will give me almost like power i can have something sturdy that wont ever randomly be like ""hey i really dont like you i was just leading you on"" i actually think this year i might be really into the whole school thing i want something to just affect me no one but me and i want something to be excited about. Considering im really done with guys, why are they so feckless i swear they like decide that they dont want anything almost completly randomly. basically life doesnt suck guys do."

<lj-cut text=""I Fall Alone""> 

Wow so i just got crazily depressed. And there i just lied, i lied to myself and everyone the truth is its been eating away at me for weeks and ive tried to hide it and cover it. I attempted to trick myself into thinking that I was happy and that i could just move and replace what i felt with cameron with someone else. I mean dont get me wrong this guy i like is great, he's really cool and we get along well. It just isnt the same at all. I mean right now its the memories that are killing me i just liked him so much i mean i dont know what love is i guess but it was the closest thing ive ever been. I just want it back i want the relationship i want him.

Its seriously so hard to write something down when you are depressed because the feeling hurts so bad you never want to be reminded of how you felt at that certain moment. Alright well i dont even know where to start i guess i can start by saying "" I miss him but im doing alright"" (thats a country lyric) I really just take it day by day some are way harder than the other. Memories seem to be the only things that hurt though, i can talk to him on the phone and still see his house and everything but i cant stand thinking about the old times. I swear anything weather its songs that we used to sing alot or if its pictures. I swear the day after we broke up i gathered all of the objects that reminded me of him or pictures of me and him. I swear the NY pics are still saved on my memory card still needing to be developed. TO BE CONTINUED lol"

Its absolutly beautiful here, its really green which is so different from nevada. I miss alot of things at home though i miss the people and the up and go about the city. Where cam lives its kind of a small town with no fast food resteraunt and nothing really but privatly owned buisness's that close at 8 at night, and if you know me im not a closing at 8 at night person at all. 

I really like him though, i mean i knew i really liked him before i came out but there are some places that are so magical. But dont get me wrong it didnt turn into a fairy tail romance we still do get in fights and yes they still are as stupid as before. Every girl wants him down here and its really weird i mean it just makes me worried i guess. I dont want to miss him either because i will miss him terribly when i leave he comes back down to nevada for about a week but then he leaves til august 15 and that will feel like forever. Its almost our 6 month. Bold.

So work, i was at work yesterday and i made so many errors some that are funny. Well we have this ride that riders seem to get fucked up on alot so this lady hit her head and she was acting like she had a concusion so i knew exactly how to handle it i did my 3 long whistle blasts and suddenly like every athority in the park is running twords me i mean first aid, supervisors and paramedics my mind was seriously just thinking what is going on. Turns out i did the whistle signal for death. Hmmm then i made a crush on this guy i work with he is so adorable yet i find out that he is in 8th grade LOL! so basically my boss is giving me a bonus if i ask him on a golfing date. HAHA it was funny.

So right now im in computer lit and the sub is really scary looking like intensly his name is mr. hand it sounds like a name off of south park. He wont let me listen to my ipod why i dont know but it sucks i really just want to listen to music. So basically ill just update since i cant listen to music space out and drool. 

Me and Cameron are stil together and i really dont know what to say about it. Its like our relationship is either amazingly good but then on the other hand it gets amazingly horrible thats an oxymoron. So his friend from new york has been in and its really slowly ruining us its like we dont ever get to hang out alone and i miss him. Also its getting really close to summer and im dreading him leaving. I dont know if we are staying together or what we were talking last night and he kinda made it seem like he doesnt want to stay together and that hurt more than anything. I really want to stay together and make it work. How can i have a good summer if he breaks up with me. I dont know maybe i shouldnt think this much about a relationship. I guess its just really hard to focus on anything else after i created a bad habbit of focusing on just that. Maybe the summer will create an independent thing for me."

Life has been really hectic lately with everything there has been drama homework and just life. Me and Cameron had a really bumpy month so far. I told him that over spring break someone kissed me and that someone didn't get him very happy. He was a guy in my algebra class that i did have a crush on. I just was really confused i mean cameron was in new york and when he goes to new york he just turns into a huge self centered bitch, so it was so easy to just kiss someone who acted like he cared about me especially when you had a crush on him. I didnt tell cameron about it for a while though it was really hard for me to tell him, i really didnt want something great to end over a stupid feckless accident. He didnt deserve that though not in the least bit he is an amazing guy and im really lucky that he puts up with my shit, not many people can do that. Suprisingly he took it really well and we didnt break up. Although one weekend we got into a fight and we broke up. It really hurt i cried non stop for about 14 hours. So we finally talked after the stupid break up and we discussed what we wanted to do. It hurt to hear some of the things he said but was good because we got alot of things out in the open. We decided we liked each other and it wasnt time to end the relationship so we are back together. I couldnt be any happier im just really trying hard to be the best girl friend i can possibly be. At first he did what he was supposed to and he gave me the cold shoulder almost but then after that i really do think it brought us so much closer. Im crazy about him and the other night he told me that he feels exactly the same about me or else he wouldnt be with me. 

High school is getting so confusing. I swear i havnt stopped doing homework in weeks. We have project upon project and tests are everywhere the end of the year always sucks though. Not only is the school school part getting confusing but i really just hate how friends dont stay around.Me and angelina became best friends in second grade and stayed really close we probably would have had no other friends if it wasnt for our moms who thought we needed more friends then in fourth grade we met lindsay and by fifth grade became a regular. In sixth grade me angelina lindsay and kayla jean all hung out now these girls are some of the most beautiful awesome girls i knew. We all stuck together throughout middle school and gained caitlin. It was the summer of 8th grade when kayla jean started to hang out with Marisa more than she hugn out with us then she got her first serious boyfriend. Thats when we lost Kayla Jean we wernt all that worried because we all still had eachother. That summer was so fun me caitlin and lindsay all had algebra together it was so fun it was filled with night of staying up all night playing have you ever with water and going to school completly tired. Lindsay would sit up againts a wall zoning out and me and caitlin would write notes constantly. That summer we all  made predictions on where we were all going to be in high school and even though we all promised to be friends forever we all went the directions we predicted. Lindsay would go with the popular group who partied and just had the great high school life. Angelina would be along with lindsay although not always. Caitlin would have the random friends not all of us knew and I would be the drifter basically some nights going everywhere. Now it's just weird to look at how predictable life is. I really do miss the nights of hot tubbing, snow cones and pointless games followed by us crashing on the floor all sharing one down comforter and of course lindsay in her large chair she always slept in. Its just sad i hate memories soemtimes i remember when i first got braces and lindsay had to show me how to brush my teeth without it hurting, and one night we went totally crazy and just wore these crazy dresses out in public. Me and lindsay were always the bold outgoing ones and to this day i still think me and lindsay are the risk takers. With caitlin i remember the first day we hung out together without the other girls we spent all day with mike and josh and hung out and to this day we are the same we like to chill in smaller groups getting to know people. And angelina is just my sister every holiday is spent with her and its still liek that. Together though we were just an amazing group of friends we honestly cared about eachother and were there for eachother. Alot of our firsts happened when we were all close friends and believe me there wasnt a night where we would laugh and laugh about them. I miss it. But i guess thats high school the loss of friends.

Well today should be good Cameron gets his lisence im so excited im going to have a boy friend with a BMW ;-). We get to go on real dates sweeet. We're all going to burkhardts tonight it should be fun."

I think it hurts so bad because this past week has been pretty amazing last night was one of the best times ive ever had and he agrees. Tonight i went over to his house and it was so sweet. I made him a playlist that reminds him of me its great. After that we sat on the bed together listening to it and just holding each other. He told me that im going to be the first person he has ever missed when he is in new york, then he picked up this necklace he wears everyday with his companion school ring thing on it and put it around my neck. It was seriously the cutest thing. Its just sucks im really sad.

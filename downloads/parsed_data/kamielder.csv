and I was stupid enough to actually come to school too.
well, actually, the only reason I came was because I needed to change my schedule for next year.

Story time!
Yesterday, an old friend called me up and asked me if I wanted to golf it up a little, and ofcourse I was like ""ok!"". So he schedules a time and we head out there and arrive a bit late. No Problems... only five minutes or so, just have to get started so we don't hold up the people behind us. He runs in to use the bathroom and as I take a few practice swings one of the people behind us waiting to tee off asks if he can join us. The guy seems nice enough and although he said he hadn't played in half a year (like me), he seemed pro. Anyway, so my friend returns and after much shaking of the hands it's my turn to tee off. I'm a bit nervous because it had been forever since I'd played and there was decent amount of people watching me but I used to be ok at golf so it didn't bother me so much. I step up to the ball, swing... miss... and suddenly, the club isn't in my hands anymore. but there is a sound like a helicopter blade winding down. Not only did I miss the ball I managed to throw my club over 40ft down a hill (after going really high and staying in the air for quite a while)

Damn I'm cool.

I worked a lot yesterday, just a lot of random stuff, hoping to do the majority of the coding for the program over the weekend if that works out. My life has been really weird as of late I guess. The world feels almost dead to me from time to time now, life and people feeling like cold mechanical systems. Magical chaos is just an illusion, just too many variables for us to percieve and comprehend all at once. Provided you understand where to make the breaks it's all too easy to see in small seperated pieces. But we don't want to accept that, or the resulting conclusion of our insignificance in the world. We want to be movie stars, and famous with lots of money, and be good christian people that subscribe to lies with our hands over our ears screaming words out of the bible so loudly as to not hear the simple truths infront of us all. We are a people residing under a government with a puppet that can barely recite the words hand fed to him. Cascating down, Propeganda exploits the very ideas that we used to be able to hold onto, of nobility, and greatness. And Provided they are not killed by people as equally corrupt as them they will live to be happy people and will fade out of existance into sweet nothingness like everyone else. It's depressing...

No more time... need to get to work and finish final...

and quoting...

""For instance, whatever virtues (from our perspective) the following memes have, they have in common the property of having phenotypic expressions that tend to make their own replication more likely by disabling or preempting the enviornmental forces that would tend to extinguish them: the meme for faith, which discourages the exercise of critical judgement that might decide that the idea of faith was all things considered a dangerous idea""

That's pretty close to the final design of newlinsoftware... didn't change a lot since the last time but have the neat flash applet (needs to be polished). The links to the rest of the site don't work but I basically have those areas done. Oh, also, I need to optimize the site too before it's done... It could be sped up by 2/3s right now without noticing any real difference.

A little bit more work and the SecureText site will be finished too, It's basically done and the new colors look really cool but I'm tweaking some of the stuff and trying to reorganize the feature/explore area to flow better information wise. I'll put together a demo sometime over the next few days and post that too.

I have a folder on my desktop that I keep all files that don't have to do with 3d rendering... it has over 280 files in it, lol. Combined with my 3d rendering files it spans over 300 build files. woo :-)

Why so many files? A lot of it is unfinished content to be used in various parts of the site, and a lot of images I have multiple finishes of (different color saturation, hue, etc...) to fit for different designs. The idea is to have a huge reservoir full of images that can basically be plugged in as times goes on and the site progresses, making it easier to update often.

"event","""...the world falls away like color melting off an old painting and there is left robert, standing in a blank white room, shaken. The air is cold enough to see his breath, but he appears strangely warm. He walks over to a small table and sits down in a worn out leather chair, directly across from a dark figure dressed in a black trench coat. They are alone in the room, and everything is quiet except for a soft, yet persistant mechanical hum. Their eyes meet and a the stranger mutely pulls a neatly folded cream colored document from his coat, sending it gliding across the table. There is a single understood space at the bottom of endless insignificant characters and robert stares at it without emotion. Escape is here, so close and so material as if it could be compared to the table which lies infront of him! Feelings slip away and a soft sweetness threatens to dull the light which struggles inside his eyes...""

"event","just to make things very clear... I'm in no way associated (in any way possible) with the success that marc is having right now (in reguard to the money he is currently making). I don't believe and try not to act so in the least bit. The pure genious is all his :-) The reason I bring this up is because I felt like I blurred the lines a bit tonight (unintentionally), and have had a very bad experiance with a person openly taking credit for what I've done before. I don't have many things that get to me but that's one of them, and I couldn't stand to do that to anyone else in any form, moreso with someone like marc.

If that makes any sense... so tired, lol.

"event","damnit, noone likes my poem =P
or reads my livejournal? how about this... if you read my livejournal post a comment. This doesn't involve anyone consistantly posting comments, and it doesn't have to be anything particularly witty or cleaver, just one simple post. 

That said... I'll do a real update which has been lacking according to the people that I talk to that happen to read this occasionally (and so the content is geared towards). Neato eh?

I'll make it easy and sum it up in a few points:

-Insane ammounts of work for me.
-lots of stress: work, parents, school, friends
-stress causing weird effects like rapid lack of trust in people, being insanely tired in the middle of the day, etc...

yah... not like I don't love it all, but it's just a bit much right now, things are going really quickly, kinda sink or swim. I normally like lots and lots and lots of stuff going on and can't get enough but this is more of an offset endurance test of if I can manage my life and keep all of the major stuff headed in the right direction.

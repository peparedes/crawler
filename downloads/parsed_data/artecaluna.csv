"event","I ~finally~ picked my bike up today from Cycle Design. Let me tell you, she is fast and the throttle has a sweet touch. 

Adventure #1
I left the dealership and drove her down to an empty parking lot to get used to the controls and how she handles...and promptly dumped her taking a tight turn when I hit some sand!  So, I'm thinking that this is actually a good thing - I have gotten that ""dump the bike"" thing done and it wasn't too bad!  The rear wheel caught the sand, slid out from under the bike, I did a total newbie move, and down we went....bike slides to the right, I go left, bike lands on top of my leg, head bounces off the pavement, I am flat on my back thinking ""oh, look, its the pretty sky"". 

I got right back up, shook it off, and tried to lift the bike - hmm, at 372 lbs dry weight, that wasn't happening.  I called my buddy Keith who rides to see if there was a technique he could coach me through for getting the bike back up - got his voice mail.  Sent a text message to my other friend who rides telling her that I dumped the bike and how do I get it back up - the reply I got from her, and I quote, was ""You're shitting me - you get 2 strong friends to help you!"".  Nice. Thanks Grace :-)  Then Keith calls me back and tries, quite gallantly I thought, to not laugh too hard while he talks me through getting the thing back up. He did ask if I was hurt or anything first. Even with his expert coaching on lifting bikes that have dumped (he rides a dirt bike and those get dumped a lot on the trails), I just didn't have the muscle mass to lift it. Sigh. Had to call in those ""2 strong friends"" to help - enter Patrick and Scott. They were very nice about the whole thing, we got the bike back up, and I got her going again. Heros that they are, they decided to stick around and be my ""coaches"" for the duration.

Adventure #2
Note to self: straighten the handlebars BEFORE applying the brake; this significantly reduces the likelihood of secondary dumps. 'Nuff said, eh?

Adventure #3
My ""coaches"" and I decided that practicing stops would be a really good thing. After several excellent stops, we decided that coming up to pretend stop signs would be good (going for the controlled, aimed stoppage).  I proceeded to come to a nice, slow stop at my self-designated stop line - got my leg down even - when I throttled fairly hard (wrist was too high, a big no-no, will work on that) and the bike JUMPED about 3 feet in the air. Wahoo! Lots of adrenalin and NO panic - didn't release the brake, held in the clutch, let the rpms go up, and got it back under control. The only problem was that my foot wasn't on the peg. This resulted in me slamming my shin with the peg - oh yeah, I will be feeling that in the morning!  Parked the bike and walked off the pain for a bit. Got back on the bike and continued riding around that damn parking lot. 

Despite the successes of the evening, I decided that driving the bike home on the highway was not such a good idea - time to call in the calvary. Pat called Tom to come ride the bike back to the house. He showed up with his Dad (who had been riding for something ridiculous like 30 years), and his Dad rode my baby home, with me following. 

The Wrap Up
The initial ""on bike"" could have gone better, but overall it was a blast and I can't wait to get back on!"

"event","Once again, I have water issues - as in, no #@!$ing running water. Life should be FAR simpler than this; one should be able to turn on a faucet and have water come out. Not my house, oh no. I have to have the water-roulette plumbing. I have a 960 ft deep well, with most excellent water levels and pressure. It is getting my plumbing to deliver the water to the end user that defies logic.

I'll be drinking twisted teas until the plumber can get here..."

"event","Remember that earlier post? Well, motorcycle guy did call a few times and we had a few laughs. Then I got ""the call"" - you know the one. This one was the ""you're a really AWESOME [insert appropriate noun like ""person"", ""lady"", ""guy""], and truly sweet, but..."" speech, left on my voicemail. Commence rapid cycle of emotion: deflation (or oh-crap-this-is-really-happening-to-me), hurt (or I-knew-that-[insert seemingly stupid action/statement you did/said here]-was-a-going-to-bite-me), oh-well-whatever attitude, screw-him-he-doesn't-know-what-he-is-missing attitude, right in to ""NEXT!"" -> I am now on no less than 3 dating sites - PerfectMatch.com, LoveHappens.com, and OKCupid.com! So far, the OKCupid site is a lot of fun, with lots of questions to answer and goofy tests to take."

"event","JLB was going to get his cast off last friday, but the x-ray showed that his break is still not completely healed. Looks like another 3-5 weeks in the new cast. He is not a happy 13 yr old, but is handling it very well all things considered.

What is up with the rain? I feel like I now live in Seattle. I really hope that we get a nice run of sunny weather soon, everything is so gray, todo, even the sky is gray...somewhere over the rainbow...

My company is moving us from Waltham to Burlington, adding about an hour (rt) to my commute. Oh, and the space is 1/2 the size of the one we have now, has almost no natural light, and we are not supposed to be working from home anymore. sigh. Well, at least I have a job and make decent money.

I came to the conclusion today that I actually am lonely for male companionship, despite my intellectual protestations of how 'happy' I am beng a strong independent woman and single mom. Just thought I would throw that out there. 

My youngest child will be turning 18 years old in 4 years 5 months. I will only be 42. A very young 42 I might add. Really, I kid you not.

A bird, a Robin to be exact, has built her nest directly above the screen door to my new front porch. How cute you might say. What a great opportunity to witness nature at work you might think. Just remember, that bird now has a perfect location from which to dive at you, and of course ""drop a bomb"" on the way by. 

Chocolate cake makes everything seem better, until the calories and fat land on your hips.  Go ahead, taunt me you deep dark chocolate birthday cake, I will NOT cave."

"event","I had the best time with my friend mistressbellona Friday night. We went out to eat at the Singapore - wicked good food - and wound up dancing in the club afterward until nearly 1 am. The local band was awesome and played excellent music that we could rock out to. Neither of us were really dressed for a club, being in jeans and standard black t-shirts, but we rocked anyway. Thanks bellona for getting me out there again!"

"event","I really haven't had a life to myself for a very long time; in fact my whole existence to date has consisted of being a wife, mother, and working at a career. My kids are all older now, my husband passed away 4 years ago, and I find that I have a yearning for fun again. I actually bought a ""fun"" car - a Mazda 3s - Zoom, Zoom! I really like driving my new car, ahem, maybe a bit too much - did I mention that it goes very fast? 

I find that I am willing to experience life differently now than I did when I was younger, more carefree and daring. I met a guy on my way to work a couple weeks ago, literally while driving my new car on Rte 2. He was on a motorcycle and started checking out my car, then he checked me out, then made a motion for ""call me"". I wrote my number down on a piece of paper and held it up, but he couldn't read it - so we both pulled over and I gave him my phone number. Can you believe that? I have never done anything so daring. The best part is that he called me and we hung out together last weekend. He is a nice guy with a great sense of humor, very playful. I completely enjoyed myself just hanging out and having no pressure or worries about a relationship. I have no idea if he will keep calling me or if we will continue to hang out; if we do, excellent, if we don't, that is ok too. No pressure. Life can just be fun."

"event","So, I have now officially joined the blogging-revolution...yay! This will probably be a stream of consciousness kind of thing for me and may not be updated regularly as I am uber-busy. It is raining here today so of course that means that my basement is flooding - oh joy. I will be heading down there shortly on water-removal duty - with my good friend Bellona's help. You know that she is a friend when she is willing to get all nasty and wet cleaning up my personal basement swamp..."

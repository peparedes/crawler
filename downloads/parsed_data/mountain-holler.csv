"event","Wow, I've done a lot sense the last time I updated. This weekend started awsome and then it just kept getting more and more weird. first the weekend really started when I got to hang out with raven for awhile, It was a lot of fun. I was suposed to meet up with her so many times this weekend, but everytime I would plan to call to hang out with her something would happen like the first time was cuz I fell asleep. the second time I couldn't find her number. and geez it sucked, cuz im sure we would have had an awsome weekend. we did hang out yesterday night. it was a lot of fun. I found out she liked mae as much as me. It was totaly rad, pretty much everything she said I related to. It stinks she left today. but hey i might get to see her all the time. cuz im planning on moving to florda. which will be of course great for me , cuz well here...lets just say theres people that dont ever want to see my face again. so it will be better this way. well im off now. so ill update later bye bye

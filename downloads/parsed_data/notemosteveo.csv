"event","SO FUCKING CONFUSED ON WHAT I WANT OUT OF MYSELF and the only person who can help me figure it out doesnt care. The one person that conviced me that college was a better choice than the army doesnt care anymore. The reason i'm here still not off somewhere being trained to hunt and kill terrorist doesnt care anymore. So basically the person who probably in reality kept me from wanting to go to war and keeping me alive a little bit longer....that kills me even more. I can't seem to forget her for some reason. No matter how hard i try or who i'm with or around her face and smile keeps coming back at me. I have nothing up or around me anywhere that reminds me of her or that can keep her alive in my mind....all thats in me are memories, but why do they take so long to fade away. Usually i'll forget in a month or two completely but i can't let go. One reason i think i cant because i realize what i did wrong and know i can fix it but i dont have the opportunity and when i did i fucked it up....
........why is it that when  i have a chance to do something to benefit me i give up or fail. Why doesnt anything ANYTHING AT ALL ever go my way. Why can't i be happy.....a line from spiderman but ""Am i not suppose to get what i want"" Does everything i do or say always have to lead me into hell?? It's stupid that i even write about this but it makes me feel a little bettter. 

ALSO fun fact that nobody knows, i wrote a small book.....2 actually and their both about 30 pages long so in a small book size probably a little over 100 pages each. My teacher read them and is going to try to get them published and if i can then hey maybe i can sell a few here and there and maybe find a career. i know they wont make movies or sell as much as harry potter but maybe it'll give me a start to something i want to be, something thats not what i am right now, which is failing at everything. Not successful. I'm a lot smarter than people realize but really lazy....too lazy, but  i wasnt when she was behind me. I think that could be why i fail or have no motivation, i have no motivation because i cant work for myself or for my well being, i have to work hard for someone else so i dont look bad in their eyes or to make them proud. NEver for me.....i never made you stand in the rain like you let me

You dont have to call me darling.....darling.....you never even called me by my NAAAAME - david alan cole


what the hell am i doing or trying to do? If their is anyone who feels like they can help me.....let me know because i need some kind of direction. Right now the only way i see i can move on is if i move out of the valley and either another college or army/marines/navy but i dunno, that could be me just talking out of my ass.......please respond"

"event","my heart aches, it cries soo much for love. I dont know whats wrong with me or why i even feel this way. Why so random? I havent seen her in months. I dont even talk to her on the phone. I dont look at our old pictures, think about her but yet whenever i get drunk i feel for her and want to talk to her. I call her and she never does pick up and if she did i'm sure i would get a negative response...she acts like if we had a horrible break up and if we fought soo much to the point where we hated each other, but it didnt even happen like that. I feel like a big panoch right now b/c im posting this but maybe she'll read this. Maybe she'll think things over and give me a second chance, but very unlikely. We both have moved on now. She has another boyfriend and i have to many girls to talk to but none of them compare to her. I know i shouldnt be doing this but i cant seem to stop typing. I'm a crazy fuck who's heart is beating at the wrong place at the wrong time. If she even felt the same way i did she wouldnt let her feelings win. She would keep away b/c from my point of view she wants to party, go out and do whatever whenever without having to worry about a boyfriend. I know she has one but he goes along with her b/c they have the same friends and thats where i dont fit in. I'm not friends with her friends and her friends could really careless about me or want me with her. Im just going to stop right there with that, i dont want to go into it. I just know no matter what other girl im with, no matter who it is, no girl is going to treat me the way she did or better. I didn't leave to the army b/c i wanted to say and be with her which yes would be a dumb choice but to me it seemed like the right one at the time b/c she was ever so special to me. If i post a picture of us up on myspace its not to piss anyone off, its to let people know she's the best and no one is going to top her. I""m not going to cut her out of a picture and post it up like she has done to me. She's in the picture for a reason and i'm not going to change it to make some people happy. Sorry to say but thats pretty fucked up if you do that. Unlike her im not going to shove her to the back of my mind and avoid her calls because it's not right we talk b/c she has another boyfriend but whatever. Also another thing some people think i cheated on her or was always out flirting around with other girls.....FUCK NO I WASNT!! I wasnt going to jepordize a relationship that was everything to me for another piece of ass. I had real feelings for her. I'm not the way i used to be. Also im not a player. THe pics on myspace with other girls or lizzie to be on the dot mean nothing. We were just dancing. I dont even want to post this up but i've typed so much why the fuck not right? Point is i was shot in the heart and now she's too late, you give looove a bad name!!! hahaha love that song. I'm just going to throw this out there and i dont care if she reads it or not or whoever reads this....I for some odd reason still have feelings for kristen, but the way things are starting to shape up i dont know how long thats going to last. Yes i would love to be her boyfriend again, no i'm not a slut like some people think. I didnt have sex with that girl from mchi, she wont be named, like everyone thinks i have....thats bullshit! To all other girls.....i'm not a slut, player, skank or whatever else you can think of. I'm a guy who loves to spoil his girlfriend, who just wants to make one girl happy, not all. I really like a girl and not just looking for sex, even though i will admit is nice to have. I do care even though it might not seem like i dont. I talk a big game and act like i dont give a shit but when it comes down to it of course i fucking care, more than you think <hint hint to someone> and i'm just a guy who wants to feel love again from the one girl i truely think is the best girlfriend i ever had, kristen. I know its a long shot but i want you back and if you really feel from your point of view right now that we probably wont get back together let me know so i can sign that last final paper in San Antonio and be off.....again i write a blog for that one special girl that i probably wont get a respose from but it's worth a try. Maybe she'll feel the same way but hey i doubt it....im going to sleep...its 1:25 am and i still have alcohol from the other night that i need to get rid of.....if anyone actually reads this let me know what you think and how crazy am I? Opinions do shape my world so let me know

                             Seal my heart

"event","Hey, I just needed to let everyone know that i'm in love with Kristen. We just spent the whole week together in San Antonio and had the  best time. We've grown a lot closer in many ways and still are. I'm used to being a flirt all the time, but realized I can't do that anymore so any girl that I flirt w/ or seems that i do i'm sorry but it's a mistake. My mistake. I never cheated on her or have and i'm going to do whatever I can to keep it that way because I love her and want a future with her. I want a strong good relationship. When we got back from S.A we got into some complications. Someone commented on her LJ that i have cheated on her with a girl named Savannah, who is a good friend of mine from a long time, at some party that my friends went to but i didnt b/c i was with Kristen that same night. So right now were on a rocky way b/c of that. She totally believes me and knows i didnt cheat on her, she trusts me 100% and i love her for that. I dunno where i'm going with this but i really just want to say that I'm with her and no one can break what we have apart. I'm not typing this for her. I'm typing this b/c i want everyone to know how i really feel and want everyone to call me a dumbass for being a flirt. Sorry Kristen for that but thats all going to change, I promise on my life. I love you babe....(horsie) lol.....she knows what it means"

"event","Well first things first.....kicker dance was an awesome kick in the ass and so much fun. I took my girlfriend which made it even better cuz we got to dance all wild wild west style even though she wasnt too thrilled about it....lol its ok she still loves me. Then i took her home and fell asleep b/c the next night was prom and i had to get up really early to get my tux, the flower thingy and then go to work from 1-6 at the mall. SO i had to do a lot before i even could make it to prom. Well got dressed picked up my date, took pics at her house, hten went over to andy's house to take more pics b/c its tradition to take pics before any dance even together at his house, so did that with my mom, sis and the Flores Family. I have some pics of me on prom night on my myspace....http://www.myspace.com/notemosteveo ....just click away and see them. If your a memember comment. After that went to go eat at Yoko's, then to prom and danced the night away which was great. Our pictures are going to come out amazing. We took two different poses. One the regular pose and the next i scooped her up in my arms and gave her a kiss....that one should come out beautifuly hopefully...i think they will. After prom is the real highlight but wont go into detail with that....we just had a great time together..
  The next day i went out to eat with her parents, grandparents and her at Amberjacks at the Island which went very well and i think i got all parents approval. Then Kristen and I stayed behind to go to Schlitterbahn for the day since i could get us in for free so we spent the rest of the day there before we started to head back. I think that pretty much sums up my weekend.....Oh and what i'm really happy about is that we both agreed were falling for each other pretty fast & hard so im glad im not alone with the feelings department with each other.....<3 ;)
     today i finished my last class i needed to which was keyboarding and turns out i can type 147 WPM!! SO after seeing i can do that i just got my credit right away, turned it in and now all i have to do is withdrawl from school and wait for the ceremony. It's been a crazy week but all of it has been great and i can't wait to finish everything..
  Also i worked out with my cousin, Noel, and i dunno if the workout we did was really that hard or am i just really out of shape? I'm pretty sure it's both since i havent ran in the past 3-4 weeks but oh well i'm going to start working out again to get my ""bod"" back so i think that'll go well. Yeah afterwards i could barely walk and after taking a shower and resting my legs still dont feel the same so fuck....i guess my legs just went weak!! Oh well....

I'm out    S T E V E - O <3 Kristen"

Went over to mchi to pick up Kristen(the girlfriend)


Then went over to Kamori for lunch with her, joaquin and pricilla....it was i guess a couple thing


Gave Kristen a ride home and met her dogs. I met the dogs before i've even met the parents...lol great


Then my sister comes home from Mexico smelling like alcohol and throws up here at home, mom gets suspicious


Mom takes her to CCD where she throws up again in class then passes out in the rest room downstairs 


Church calls my parents letting them know they can't find my sister anywhere. Thats because she was past 

out in the restroom and didnt find her until i just walked in there to find her on the floor. Then have my

Track coach, who also goes to the same church, help me get her sorry ass off the floor and takes her home


She gets bitch at by parents while I laugh in the backround then realize whats going on and bitch at her to


She falls down after slipping on the carpet and cuts her eye that is now swollen and blames it on me


Go out to eat with Chino, Curtis and Ryan...(yes one philipino, two black guys, and me)


Then drive around aimlessely but somehow i pick up two six packs of Barcardi thats still in my trunk at

"event","<P>Last night i had one of&nbsp; the best nights i've had all year and really just got me out of the slump i was in. I met this beautiful girl Kristen sometime ago and we started to get close and last night was just the finish of the prelimanaries and now were together! I'm so happy about it because i thought it wouldnt happen with us but things really picked up and turned around. Last night at Relay for life we spent the entire night with each other and probably were seperated for about 2 minutes the most which was great. Oh yeah she's blonde to, shouldnt be a suprise to most of the people who know me and is a sophmore at mchi.She met my mom and dad which usually never happens right away when we start to talk or together because i'm really picky about which girls my parents meet but with her it seemed right. WEll besides the fact that her mom works with my mom at the same elemntary in edinburg so eventually she would have met her either way but i'm glad she did met her. She also met my godparents who never have met one my girlfriends or even came close to meeting one but they were there last night to so i introduced her to them even though it took two tries. My sister approves which is also good b/c my sis would be a bitch to the girl if she didnt like her and i would have to put that bitch in place so yeah, glad thats not a problem. So everything seems to be going pretty good with kristen but there's still one major problem and thats her parents. Her mom isnt really thrilled about the fact that i'm 18 so were going to have to kiss a little ass to get that to change so hopefully nothing will go wrong. She works and knows my mom so hopefully that can help a little bit somehow. Well I just wanted to post up my big news of last night and now i have to hop in the shower and get ready for work at 4 for my first official day at A&amp;F! BYE</P>

"event","Well fuck....my track season is over. My SENIOR track season is over. It didn't go the way I wanted to. I just couldn't improve. After All this time working out morning and after school and sometimes around 9 at night getting 5 or more miles in. I couldn't perform at track meets. Work outs i would kill and run better than what i'm suppose to but when it came to the big race the only two things i can think of is that either I choked or i'm just worn out. Out of strong muscle that i had in the begining that didnt last. Well on the upside i got some good pictures of my friends and everyone at the track meet. I had a good time even though I didn't get to run my favorite race of all time....the 4x400 relay and won't ever again. But then again i couldn't perform so it wasnt like I would have done all that good anyways. I know i can hit a 51-52 seconds in the quarter. Coach knows it to. One thing about coach is that he never bullshits a runner about his ability on the track and this past week on monday after that workout he came and told me that I'll be hitting 51's this past meet. He said he could tell by the way i ran that workout. That I held myself up good, didn't let off the gas and finished that last 100 meters in under 14 seconds and after sprinting a 400, thats hard to do. I also felt it in myself that i could do it to after that workout and started to think that I'm ready to tear it up thursday in the Prelimanaries.Well I did total opposite so he pulled me from the 4x400 which i expected but hope it wouldnt have happened and was left with an 800 meter run for that day and only that run but he told me that at Regionals I would run it because we for sure were going to get there in the 4x4 and i agreed but the unthinkable happened. Something I didnt expect whatsoever and no else thought it could happen, but it did and we'll leave it at that. We ended up coming in 5th place in the 4x4 and you needed top 3 to get to regionals so obviously we didnt make it and my dream to run at Regionals was destroyed and never to be thought of again b/c now there is no chance no matter what, but fuck it. I felt bad taking someone's spot on the team to run over there if i didnt make it there myself so it was pretty much ruined when coach told me he was pulling me from it so i guess i had time for it to sink in. I hope coach still takes me on the regional trip though with the guys. I seriously still want to go b/c last year it was soo much fun even though I got into a car crash in S.A with chino.....haha good times, good times. At the track meet i started talking again to this girl that i met the week before that i think is absolutley beautiful...yes she's a blonde, what else would she be knowing me right? I hope things can move in a positive way with her soon and fast because I would want to take her to prom since i dont have a date yet b/c my ass is really picky about who i ask but i'm loosing time so hopefully if she's intrested, from what i hear from her track gals she is, things will go smoothly. BUT i'm really shy around her for some reason. I guess you can say i'm at lost of words and things to talk about so yeah i'm a wreck when it comes to her...any advice that is willing to be thrown my way throw it. Some of the track guys and girls who read this should know who i'm talking about....the pretty sophmore from Mchi....yep thats the one i guess you can say i'm intimidated by or afraid of and that doesnt happen often with me once i started conversation, but blondes will do that to me. 

   On an upside of this weekend i got hired at Abercrombie & Fitch and had my 1st day today. Well really it was orientation but it was fun. I get 50% off most clothes and the lowest % i can get off is 30% so considering how expensive the clothes are there thats a good thing. Everyone that works there seems to be really nice and friendly. Today I met my assistant manager, shit forgot her name, Candice-this girl thats a year older than me that i went to middle school with and this other girl named Pricilla that i think lives in Pharr not to sure. She didnt talk much. All we did today was get the forms filled out, learn the way around the backroom, learned how to fold all the clothes in certain ways and just how to be and work in the store. Everything seems pretty easy, not to hard. I just hope everyone doesnt turn into a bitch after awhile and take off their ""fake happy to see you masks"" and then really see the devil in them. But it doesnt seem like it so thats a plus. They hired two more other guys besides me, one of them graduated at Memorial last year and who i used to hang out with a lot, John Pinero. So it was a good suprise to see him there in the morning so atleast im not going in on this alone and the other guy was named Mario. He wasnt too bad either.

After that went over to Chino's amd chilled with him and curtis for awhile then went over to Cici's and the twins house to pick up some money so they can finally pitch in for the chicken that we were going to BBQ today at my house. About 8 mchi girls showed up and most of the Varsity track guys except B-rad and Levi, everyone else showed....Way to be apart of the team guys!! If them two showed up there would have been more black people than hispanic people and that would be a 1st at my house considering it is a hispanic household....and there were two white people and one philppino/asain guy. We all had a pretty good time and had a shit load of chicken that was finished. I got two lap dances....THANKS GIRLS!! They were very enjoyable....can't wait for the two private ones that were negotiated...haha. We of course were video tapping the whole thing so everything we did was caught on camera so if someone who wasnt there wants to see it can and will next time were over at my house. We watched it after everyone took off and it came out pretty good, but doesnt beat the time we set my whole diving board on fire,walked and jumped on it!! Can't wait for that one to happen again. I also developed that pictures that i took yesterday today and they came out pretty good. I think Nick Moore took two pictures with my camera w/o me knowing which is alright since they both have Kristen in them....yes thats the sophmore from mchi i'm intimidated by, but don't tell her that. So a good mistake nick....well fuck i'm getting tired and its 12:15. I got to get some rest even though i dont ahve practice anymore ever again. I still have 3 hours of school that i need to go do...hahaha yeah like that needs a lot of sleep for....I'M OUT BITCHES!!!!"

"event","This week is going to make me or break me and seriously it will. Tomorrow i have track Preliminaries for one race and thats the 400 meter dash. Sooo since i have that one race im going to blow it out to make it to finals saturday and thats when the fun and hurt start to kick in. That day i'm racing in the 800 meter run and if i make it to finals,whcih i probably will, then the 400 meter then to top off the night the 4x400 meter relay which in this order goes Sai to Danny to Brad to me. Yeah i'm anchor which means i can either do one of three things.....keep the position, improve our position or hopefully not this one loose our position and get under 3rd place to not qualify to regionals....I have confidence in myself that i'm going to kick ass since the work out monday i ran a 500m in full sprint in 71 seconds! Which is condsidered really good since Louie ran that workout in 68-69 seconds and he was a state champion so im only a few seconds behind and if i run the way i did monday tomorrow and saturday im sure i can come up with the big ""W"". :Deep Breath: I know its all the way in Rio but pleace come and cheer us on if you can. Seriously if i make it to regionals then im going to be in the greatest fucking mood until graduation and i wont look at myself as a failure.....So please post up something supportive everyone even if its small..

"event","Man this past weekend was a blurrrrr. Friday was the track meet over at mchi that started at 2 till 8....it was the shortest track meet i've ever been to, only 6 hours long which wsa pretty cool cuz ususally i get home around 11 from track meets and just fall straight asleep. But the whole day i was planning to bbq at my house with whoever wanted to come. I didnt really care who or how many came, i just wanted to swim and eat chicken, which i did. At the track meet i got 4th in the 400m, i could of done better and my 4x4team got 1st!!! FUck yeah!! I'm proud of myself, BUT bradley and I had the worst hand off....and i seriously blame that on our coach. OK it was sai to danny and danny to brad then to me. When Bradley was coming to hand off to me i was waiting for him to get a bit closer in the zone so i dont take off to early. I didnt think it was time for me to take off yet but my coach yelled Steven get out of there so i took off and brad yelled for me to slow down b/c i took off to early. So i took off and had to stop completely nad take a step back to get it which probably took off 1 or 2 secods off then turn back and start racing....we were ahead by 45 meters so it didnt really matter but gave me the slower time which i didnt like since i was trying to improve it so fuck that didnt happen.....oh well we still got 1st and won by a lot.District is coming up this weeka and im starting to get pretty nervous b/c i dont want to feel like i've been running all this time and for my season to end w/o making it to regionals. I just dont want 4-5 months of training to end in less than a minute of a race....kinda sucks if u think about it for everything to end in so little time when you put sooooo much into it.....anyways
   Well after that leter that night curtis, chino and i went to go buy some chicken and every place we went to were closed so we had to buy some expensive ass bbq for less of the chicken we usually get. SO we were low on chicken that night. When i got home there were like 15 freshman guys at my house from mchi with 3 girls swimming.....cock fest. MY sister always invites her friends when she knows im going to have people over....i think she just does that to look like she knew a lot of ppl when they come over so when her friends can see that she's ""popular"" or some kind of bullshit like that. But seriously she only invites a lot of ppl over when she knows im going to bbq....it fucking pisses me off. I dont mind her usual crew that come over often cuz im cool with them but when she invites all these ppl who come to swim , use our towels and eat our food then leave pisses me off. Fuck that next time that shit happens those bitches are out. It ended up being Carlo,Becca, Catey, Nick, Danae,Martha,Valencia,Chino, Nelson, Hannah, Chris, Curtis, Cici, Sai, Some rob guy, my sister, chacon and jennifer the next couple of nights at my house.....MARTHA AND VALENCIA can come over anytime aslong as they do what they did that night over and over again cuz damn that was FUCKING HOTT what they did with and around my SLIDE by the pool!! 
     Saturday night was about the same except for that fact that i got fucking wasted!!! Sorry to say coach, who i promised that i wouldnt drink till after the season but there's a lot of pressure thats been put of me in this past week and that little night of esccape was well worth it and what i needed, but i did run 5 miles sunday so its not like i drank w/o working out. 
  FUCK FUCK FUCK i just remembered something....i weighed myself at the beggining of the week and weighted 144lbs and yesterday when i did it again i weighed 138lbs!!! How the hell am i losing weight? I'm not even trying to? Or how did i gain it and then loose it and how long have i been doing this??? I dunno but i thought that was the wierdest part of my week.
  I finally talked to this girl from mchi that i've been trying to talk to since January......yeah long time but i was shy. This girl is one of the hottest blondes that i've met so i didnt want to say hi and just look like a complete dumbass....actually i wasnt even the one who started talking to her, she started the convo 1st. I was asking my teammatesfor some ""coco butter"" b/c i wanted to get a tan on the field while i waited for my turn to race and she had her friend tell me she had some coco butter for me if i wanted some and to my suprise she really did have some coco butter when i went over to ask her if she really did have some. If she wasnt the 1st one to talk i dont think i would have simply b/c she's too beautiful and im seriously intimidated by her even though she's younger but i'll get over it....I dont know if she's heard shit about me but if she did i doubt its good cuz for some reason ppl only like to talk about the bad shit and one of her friends i had a past experience with and it was good but i dont think aftewards was such a good ending but oh well. I've heard that she was a hardcore bitch but it doesnt seem like it, she looks quiet. I dunno i just know right now i think she's pretty hott and would like to get to know her better.....so yeah
      I have an interview tomorrow over at Abrecrombie & Fitch at 4 so im excited about that and hope to get the job so i can start saving money for prom....still dont have a prom date yet but i was offered by Analee to take her if i wanted to, whcih i wouldnt mind b/c she's beautiful, but i have my eye on two girls that i really want to go with....i want to go with one of them but im not saying who....but i can say there both BLONDES.....yeah what a suprise coming from me right? 
     Well i'm out...oh and hey if you read my journal post up so i know who's reading it cuz im curious....doesnt have to be really anything just like a Hi or something....alright i'm out

"event","Today has been a pretty good day. We had the day off from track since we have a track meet tomorrow at MCHI that starts at 12 and end around 6-7. I should do pretty good at this meet. Hopefully when i race the 400m i can be able to turn and look back to this bitch from rowe named Curtis, smile and continue on going to kick his ass for about the 17th time in a row. This guy always says he can beat me but never does...always come up 2 or more seconds BEHIND. Anyways played a little PSP that i got for my b-day which i soooo enjoy and appreciate. Everyone was amused by it to. I have a huge crush at school, but she has a kid. I dont care though, i'll get over it. She's blonde and beautiful. I'm probably going to talk to her tomorrow and introduce myself. I went made a copy of my car key at Broadway. Then went and got my braces off!!! Jennifer and my sister say i look like a totally different person in a good way. So i hope thats a good sign. Went to Circut city and returned something i bought from there and got my $15 dollars back! Then went to the mall and applied at Abrecrombie and Fitch and while i was applying was told to come in tuesday for an interviwe at 4p.m. So within an hour after getting braces off i get a number from this pretty decent girl named bonnie and got an interview. So i think braces coming off did me some good. Then Jen picked me up and we went to the mcallen PD so i can pay off a ticket for $158 with dad's credit card. But now im on probation for four months. I cant get a ticket for four months and if i do the ticket will go on my record, but if i dont i get my money back and nothing goes on my record. I feel all juvy being told im on probabtion. Came home ate some food and now here typing on my comp.

Show friday at V.F.W. Kevin and Chris's band will be playing. I heard a recorded song called I think Green Eyed girl and it sounded pretty smooth. I'll be at that show fo sho if i can get out of my track meet fast enough to get there to hear them....i'm going to try guys!! I'm Out

"event","This is probably my sadest journal entry. I lost a friend/cross-country/sprinter/brother this past saturday morning at 10:15 a.m. One of my best friend's brother, Andy Saldana, died on the way to work on the express way. He was hit by a suburban and his helmet was shattered. This was totally unexpected. He was coming back from his fiance's house going to work with his dad when it happened. I heard about it around 1 o'clock. All i knew was that one of Danny's brothers had died and I prayed it wasnt Andy since he was the closest to him and one of the older guys that i looked up to since he did everything i'm doing now in high school. He wasnt a dick or anything negative....he was an awesome guy who never let you have a dull moment if you were with him. I still couldnt believe it until i went over to danny's house today to hang out with him and say hello to his family. Seeing his picture on top of the T.V in the living room with candles, rosery and a bible around it really made me realize that I lost someone in my life for the first time. I never knew how it felt to loose a friend until today how sick you can feel. Especially since the brother is one of your good friends that your with every school morning pefore school and after school for the past 3 years training for cross country and track. I never seen any kind of sadness in danny before. I started to tear when i first saw danny wrapped around a pole crying telling me ""he's dead steve, my brother is dead."" i'll never forget that moment b/c i felt i lost someone to. The rosery is tomorrow at Memorial Funeral Home in San Juan at 7 p.m. I never would have thought for a second that Danny and I would have to spend our birthdays in a funeral home for his brother. He loved Danny so much, its unbelievale what happened how life is truely precious and can be taken away from you in a couple of seconds. I've had 3 deaths this weekend that I know of. Andy, the Pope and my Dad's Cousin all died on the same day. WTF is going on seriously? If you know Danny just say hi, give him a hug and tell him that you love him. I don't want him to feel that he's alone just after he lost his best friend. If you see him tomorrow say Happy Birthday to him to(also to me).

"event","I gave two pints of blood today at school b/c i'm a blood donor and my blood is universal so everyone can use it in the ""universe."" Yeah fuck all the rest of you who can only have one type of blood. That sucks. ANYWAYS stupid me thought i would be able to run in the afternoon. Oh yeah and they gave me a free personal pan pizza and wristband that says ""GIVE BLOOD"" for my donation which i did enjoy. 
So i'm out there running and what not warming up and waiting for Bradley to finish his warmp up. Yes he's the best sprinter at memorial but he always gets there 10 minutes or more late, making his late entrance, and takes the longest time to stretch. 
So while i'm there waiting for him to get his rub down, my legs start to cool down and get tired. Finally he's ready and im cold and he's warm so this is going to suck. We ran 6x200s all under 28 seconds, but being the superstars that we are we ran the 1st one in 26(thats usually the girls sprint time for the 200m so we were going pretty fast) then did the rest in the time we were suppose to since fatigue hit me harder that i've ever been hit by it before b/c i was running w/o 2 pints of blood that i had the day before so my body wasnt used to it. I was suppose to do 8 but only could do 6 since of my conditions. There was no use beating a dead horse if it was already dead, thats the way coach described me when i told him i could run the last two. 
So i had to cool down, stretch and head in. Well when i headed in i started feeling really dizzy and tired so when i sat down on the bench in the track room i FAINTED. Never in my life have i fainted and in the place where i least expect me to i did and was out for a good 5-10 minutes until Chino came by and woke my ass up thinking i was taking a nap. So went home and about to hit the bed when i saw Splinter Cell:Chaos Theroy Limited Edition laying on my couch waiting for me to pop in and start it. And thats just what i did and forgeting about my lazyness. And now im here typing away to a large full loaded empty room of readers. I'm out and passing out....see you bitches tomorrow at 7:15 in the morning...

"event","THis past easter break was pretty good and relaxing. I BBQed the whole week, even on good friday. I dont really follow that rule where you can't eat meat on fridays. SHit thats when it was on sale and we got about 20lbs for about $10. FUcking awesome deal and enough to feed us for the rest of the weekend till monday night. 

Friday i invited some of the track people that i could get ahold of over to bbq and swim since the water was absolutely perfect and cuz i've been dying to swim since last august. Chino, Samm,y Curtis, Ryan, Kayla, Cici, Cameron, Carlo, Analee, Andy, Danny, Monica, Angella, Nina and her boyfriend came by for the Q. After eating enough we all started swimming and got a little crazy with fire. First we started by putting a little square of paper down and lighting it up, which became pretty big and jumping on it, then diving to the pool. But then that got old so we decided to make the fire bigger and longer. So we did and then i jumped and sat on it not knowing the paper would stick to my wet shorts and stick to my ass till i fell into the pool. yeah i got a little burned on that one. The last time we played w/ fire we made it about 3 feet long and about a foot and half high....that fire was fucking hott. Stupid me being the smartest dumb person decided not to run over but to walk on it casually. Damn that was a mistake but looked hilarious on film. After getting minor burns and around 1 in the morning i got back in the pool b/c angella wanted to get in and had no one to get in with so i jumped in with her. I didnt mind it at all. It was nice having time to talk with her again considering last time we actuall hung out was during x-mas break. After that everyone went their seperate ways and chino, me, curtis, ryan, carlo and Cammeron went over to Big Papa Stu's house for a couple of games of Hold'em and Poker. That I won might I add taking all their chips away and even giving some back so they can keep playing and still won them back....yeah im good at hold em and alright at poker. So i spent about an hour there till around 2:30am i think, im not to sure then just went home and crashed

Saturday was a blurr. I did shit all day then somehow it ended up at night being pricilla, Carlo, Cici, Ryan, and Curtis. So it was 4 black people and 2 hispanics at my house. Thats never happened before but was fun anyways. We were chillin outside BBqing again then it started to rain and that was the end of that night

Sunday- CHurch, Family, and driving around Mcallen with the twins and Chino for a good hour doing nothing and trying to complete a simple task like buying Charcol to eat the rest of the BBQ at my house again. But we fucked that up and ending up driving around singing to the worst songs on 94.5. I forgot the rest

Monday- had practice and almost had a heart attack when i finished my 4x400s under 65 secs each and then 4x200s under 28 seconds. If you know track....that work out sucks ass. I couldnt breath for about a minute or even get to my feet. It was one of the scariest moments cuz i couldnt help myself. While I lay there and lose breath the soccer girls just stand and look at me wondering whats wrong as i clamp my heart and role over a bunch of times. The only one there to help me up was Sai, well probably b/c he somewhat seemed the same way and was the only one next to me. Even with his help i couldnt stand on my own two feet for more than 10 seconds. Anyways came home showered had Jennifer, Chino, Javi, and Nina come over to finally finish the BBQ. They took off and i just crashed.....pretty weird weekend if i could remember it all i would let you know.

Well bitches my birthday is coming up once again on April 4. I'll be 18 finally. I'm starting to wonder how many more will I have after I join the Army....only time will tell...till then"

"event","TOday i went into the ortho thinking yes its time for me to get them off, but i was wrong. My dad on the way out said finally but when the doctor called him to confirm that he said no so i was in there like wtf is going on and i couldnt release myself b/c i'm not 18 yet. So i called him and he told me my mom said no to but its not going to be their choice anymore in 13 days when I do turn 18 so might aswell get them off while i was there right? Well after i told them its my decision and they cant do shit anymore in 13 days they said alright but now i have to bring home a paper saying that its alright with them. Damn i feel young and under age w/ i am but im 13 days away from being legal so why should it matter but fuck it i get them off sometime this week no matter what. Can't wait cuz i like my smile the way it is and even though im not done its still straight. I cant be done till i get jaw surgery probably next year cuz i have a big over-bite. i could keep them on for another year but fuck that surgery takes an hour and a few days or weeks of pain. I'd rather do that then wait another year and plus i need them off before august before i take off to the Army so its a must either way. After i join the Army Medical and Dental care are taken care for so i wouldnt pay shit verses now if i get the surgery now i would have to quit track cuz i would be unable to run and be out of school for about a week and a half so fuck that. I need to graduate! 
        Kinda Scary that in 2 months i'll be living on my own in my brand new trailer my parents are signing for in 2 weeks with a master bedroom, coucn that turns into a bed and a room with 4 bunk beds that sleep 8 (not including the floors) also kitchen, toilet, shower, T.V and all the rest of the good stuff. For those of you that dont know I'll be living in a trailer at the beach on the jetties to the right of the bridge b/c i scored a SUPERVISOE job at Schiltterbahn beach that i think should be paying me $12:50 to $18.00 an hour to walk around the park and make sure everyone are doing their job, which is pretty easy. So yeah on my own this summer at the beach so whoever is over at the beach and wants to get in free at Schiltterbahn just call me up and i'll hook you up with a place to stay and free food and tickets at the park. I'll have one roommate staying with me at the trailer. He's graduating from E.N.H.S cougars and he worked with me last year at super splash as head lifeguards. My old boss is the new Manager over at the beach and called us up to see if we would like the jobs over there and sounded good to me and him so we took the jobs and now we'll live there all summer.
                                          Shit that I did today.....
Today woke up at 6:15 to go to track practice at Memorial at 7. Got there lifted weights from 7:15 till 8:15 then went out ran 3 miles came back in and showered, waited for the bell to ring then took off. I decided not to go to school today since i had an ortho appointment at 10 a.m and i'm from memorial usually from 7:15-9:30. So it would be pointless to go for 15 minutes and leave. So went to the ortho and that shit i typed earlier happened. Then i came home to find my dad same place where i left him, on his chair in his room in his boxers watching T.V. He told me to go to school but i was in a bad mood that i didnt get my braces off so he didnt argue with me and let me stay. THen around 12 my mom came home b/c she was feeling sick from the night before and she didnt even get mad that i didnt go to school so it was all good. I just didnt stay home and do nothing all day though. I worked on my school shit anyways since i want to finish a class by thursday and get credit for it already and also just listened to music on Launch. I fell in love with a song last night thats probably old but i never heard it b/c i was never into this group too much. ""Helena"" by My Chemical Romance, i saw the music video on launch and damn that video is perfect for the song and for some odd strange reason the Video moved me a bit. I think b/c it was about death, but overall it was really good. I found myself unable to stop listening to that song and saw that video like 10x probably last night seriously. Just over and over again. They song is soo good. Also i cant tear away from ""Ugly"" by the exiles. Anyway my mom left to her doctors appointement at 2 and i just sat around drinking as much water as possible and getting ready for track practice again at 3:00 till 6:00. damn when i think of my schedule it's like this 6:15-wake up get to school for practice at 7:15 till 9:04, then to circle K for a chorizo & egg taco, then usually get to school at 9:30 and stay till 12:35. Then either get something to eat with Jennifer or just stay home and sleep till 2:30, get up go to school either get treatment or play basketball till practice starts. So thats from 3:00-6:00, after that go home, eat and just lay around. Probably pass by Edgardo's and Andy's house for an hour or to occasionally and then get home and do what i'm doing now....chilling on the computer, updating, typing essay for English and try to figure out if prom is on the same weekend i have my regional track meet in S.A. I will miss prom for Regionals. Regionals to me is a HUGE thing and is one race away from getting to STATE!! But at that race are the fastest people from some parts of Texas. If i can out run them, get pass them somehow someway and make it to STATE. I would forever live in peace. I pray every night(yes i do Pray, weird right?) that my 4x4 team will win district and move on past Regionals and State Level. I do encourage everyone and anyone come cheer us on this Thursday in Weslaco or Next Saturday In Edinburg for ""Meet of Champs"" Thats the who's who in the Valley track. If you want a scholorship to run at a college, this is the meet where you kill yourself on the track to get yourself there. I swear on my life I will Kill myself at this track meet and will collapse after i run the 4x4 race because i need to hit 52.9 seconds or beter in the 400 meter dash this thursday or next week...if i dont their goes my hair. Yup i will be shaved b/c the theory is i cant run faster than at 53 seconds is b/c my hair is holding me back that .5 of seconds, which is probably true cuz in the video my head is pulling my neck back cuz of the wind. Oh yeah then i had to pic up my sister on Sonic cuz she was having some fish meeting about running relay for life. She made me get off so all her fish friends could see me and get a look at me because not even trying to be cocky but most of them think i'm hott, which is flattering, but too young. There was only one girl i would go out with thats a fish and that fish has swam by and probably wont swim back, which i wouldnt mind if she did. Anyways so yeah modeled for them for a bit then got in the car. 1st thing my sister says ""Ellane would not stop staring at you."" Flattered but not intrested, sorry. Dropped off my sister at home and picked up the water jugs to fill them up at a watermill, but before i went to do that i passed by Andy's place to see what he was up to. When i got to the door i didnt even get to knock, cara just comes out with a big smile and told me im walking home b/c andy wont take her to get food and she was waiting for him to come after her but he didnt. So i told her to hide behind one of the cars and i'll go in and tell andy that she took off all pissed. So she went to hide behind the moms car and 2 minutes later Andy and I come out and andy is bitching and bitching and takes off to go look for her and out pops cara from behind the moms car. So now we had to get in my Suburban and drive around lookig for Andy looking for cara, who was in the car with me looking for Andy. WE found him 5 minutes later at Cara's house and they kissed and Made up. It was fun and had to be one of those things you had to be there for to laugh your ass off. Filled the jugs with water, talked to Analee for a bit and hopefully do something with her tomorrow since we havent hung out in awhile. Went home, and now here...so yeah thats my day so far...Fuck well i'm out

       Post anything good or bad. I don't care anymore. No regrets. I leave in 2 months anyways so who cares what happens in that time.....Post up........Peace"

"event","So far all i've done this morning was wake up late around 7 50 and had to be at memorial at 8 00 for decathalon. I ended up getting there at 8 10. My dad just drove to the corner of hackberry ana 2nd and i just jumped out of the car and booked it to memorial b/c i didnt want to miss this event. It's something i look forward to all year. When all the cross country guys that you talk trash to and hang out with every morning finally get to duke it out and see who can come out on top. This year though i was looking foward to it but not that much b/c this year i was in maybe the worse shape i could possibly be in to do this event. It's also the cross country final exam. Anyways i usually win the pull ups event, weird since i have the longest arms and have to stretch all the way down till there straight and barely half an inch from the floor and go back up again as many times as i could. This year when that event came around i was soo dead from the previous events which were push ups, 800m run, crunches in a minute, and i think im missing a few things but cant really remember right now. Anyways i had already missed the mile but i wouldnt have done too great in that anyway since again im out of shape so almost everyone had points on the board nad already ahead of me. Well i was tied with the twins at 6 points, sucks for javi since he did the running events and Julian was still up with him with a messed up ankle, i could atleast had more if i ran the mile, so when the twins did the pull up somehow Julizzy beat J-Spot and got more points....that sucks for J-spot since he did all the events. I ended up getting 2nd place in that event even though i think i could have done better. I think i got 4th or 5th overall but i didnt get to stay to hear the results b/c i had to head back to my school for the day and didnt want to be late. Well that is over and i was late, 2 periods late. Shit and i thought i was going to be on time

 Well i have an extra ticket to go see Hatebreed tonight but i dont know who to give it to. Either Chris or Camel. There both good friends and i would have an awesome time with each of them but not sure who to give it to. I have known Camel since middle school and known Chris since Fish year when he clogged my sisters toilet when he took a massive shit....hahahaha damn nigger sister got the shaft on that one. I dunno but still have time to decide. The original person i was going to give it to cant go b/c she has finals tomorrow and has to study for htem, i called her last night to make sure she couldnt go but she didnt answer her cell so i guess i'll never know. It would have nice to bring this girl b/c she is my type completely....blonde and blue/green eyes. Thats all i ask in a girl, oh well she's really pretty to, but im not going to get into that. The show should be pretty fucking awesome so im looking foward to it but im going to go take a nap right after school b/c im spent after these morning events. Getting thrashed around for 5 hours in sweat isnt going to be easy if i go with the energy i have now. I saw Hatebreed at Ozzfest and it was intense, when they took the stage i could barely stand up right with the crowd mossing every 2 seconds but it was fun. I didnt get hurt just a couple of bruises which was acceptable.

I swear this has been bugging me for the longest time and i hate it when it just randomly pops into my head. Everytime i see an Ex gf i they're the biggest bitches. I'm over all of my ex girlfriends, ALL OF THEM, even some dont think so. Seriously all i would want is a simple hi if i see you or some form of acknoledgement so i know you know i exsist. I dont care if your with your new bf or soon to be a hello isnt going to kill. Especially when i know your bf and he isnt a bad guy or dick like that where he'll go crazy if you say hi to another guy. I dont know why im talking about this or finally talking about this i just want to get things straight with people and ex's. Because i hate it when im with a girl for some amount of time and things have died down and no feelings exsist anymore between the people but there still bitchy. I swear if i knew they were going to be like this after a relationship i wouldnt have gone out with them, i would have rather just been friends seriously. Cassidy i would like for you to quit reading my journal. I know that you do, Savannah saw you reading it in class atleast twice a week. Usually it wouldnt bother me but fuck cassidy you've been the biggest bitch i EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER gone out with and for TWO and A half FUCKING YEArs!! I tried to get along with you at the beauty pagents or the dinners for them. I dont care if your with ""DJ kid mike"" his music sucks ass, why would i care if you were with a guy shorter than you, has craters all over his face, 26 years old and has a damn kid. That just looks nasty on your part. Your a beauty pagent winner, i see your pics everywhere especially fudrockers. You can do better than that piece of shit. Even tell him what im typing, i dont give a fuck and if he wants to come after me tell him where i live bitch!! I just dont care anymore, i just want you to quit giving me shit when im at the beauty pagents cheering for Ana Lee. I'm there for her, not you so quit thinking im there to see you. And no im not with that girl anymore, Danae, that you saw me with at one of the pagents so if that gives you jollies there it is. If it even makes you happier she broke up with me!! Now that there's shit about you in this journal for everyone to read i dont think you like it now do you? I'm not trying to be a dick but im one naturally....weird i look back at what i typed and i didnt even think i could hate someone as much as her. Danae i could deal with the bitchieness but i was with her for like 3 months then got bored of me so oh well but Cassidy TWO YEARS!! Thats two years i wish i could take back. Oh and if you havent heard Cass i'm leaving to the Army just as we talked about when we were fishes that we argued about b/c you didnt want me to die well bitch i guess im going to now....well fuck im out

"event","For some weird reason i cant remember what i did friday. I think i hung out with mike for awhile...yeah friday i just chilled and played some H2 with mike and some other ppl since he had SAT saturday morning and i had to wake up to move back into my house

  Saturday woke up at 7 in the morning and started to load a trailer of all of my furniture into it to take back to my house thats finally finished and looks awesome. I dont mind being at home anymore now that it feels like a home. Anways packed and unpacked all day then hung out with my cousin Noel before he left to New Jersey the next morning. After that picked up my sister at her friends house then picked up mike from Jaime's then went back home where Liz met us to see my casa nad hung out there for awhile. After that went dropped off mike home then went over to Edinburg to see Heather. I was with her for a good while and had a pretty ""fun"" time then went home falling asleep b/c i was soo tired b/c that day was hell but ended great!! 

 Sunday morning fixed up my house a little better, showered and went over to La lomita park where we were going to have a BBQ for my grandpa's birthday. It was nice to have all of my dads family there since i dont get to see htem that much. Played some frissbee and dodge ball with them and won since i was the biggest, strongest & oldest one there. Then went into the La Lomita church with my grandpa to check it out and relized that while we were in there he had a beer in his hand walking around drinking. When i told him to put it away all he said was ""it's my birthday and i'll do what i want."" I couldnt stop laughing after htat since i've never really have ever gotten a response like that from him. I told him i was joining the Army instead of the Navy and he was estatic about that since he was in the Army and now wants to swear me in. So toward the end of the year or when i graduate were going to go swear me in and officialize it. OHhh and prior to all of this on the way over to the park I won 2 tickets to hte HATEBREED concert tomorrow!! FUck yeah, i have an extra ticket and have in mind who i want to take but i dont know if she'll be able to go since she has finals all this week....lol loser. After that BBQ i went over to joaquin's houes for another BBQ. Juan, Ana, Amrit, Joaquin, REy, Gulliermo, ""Chaps,"" mike, Jessica, Jennifer and Chacon were all there and it was fun b/c the orignal crew from middle school which is Amrit, rey, Juan, Ana, Joaquin and me were all together at the same place which we havent been back together hanging out in the past 3 years. SHit since high school started, but that'll happen. I stayed there till about 1:30 in the morning drinking and chillin then finally went home to sleep.

 Now im here in the libary 5th period pretending to look up cliff notes for the Cantaberry Tales for Eng 4. Joey if you read this Lori is right next to me and looks damn fine...give her a call dumbass...haha. I'll be probably working with you soon at Amrit's store. He's going to hook it up with a job so we'll pullthose 10 hour days together my African AMerican BrothA.

"event","It's damn cold today.....i think it's because some lady named Olga at some hair salon my mom goes to hacked off all of my hair when i wasnt looking. Yes yes i have short hair once again.....it looks semi good but i'm not really feeling it. Today hopefully Best Buy gets some more PS2s in so i can finally get mine. I have Dragon Ball Z; Budaki 3 for PS2 but no PS@....damn. It's a fucking awesome game, i think i like it better than H-2(Halo 2 Slang.) This past week of break was awesome....I slept so much, had nothing to do so no worries. I ate everything i saw and for some reason lost 2 pounds so i'm now 136 lbs...fuck yeah!! Still in good shape for doing jack shit..gotta love my matabolism. Friday night i came home after mike's house to find Sy, fellow cross-country fish teammate at memorial, at my apartment hanging out with my sister and the every so beautiful Addy. They just got back from a quincenera that my sister and Sy were in and were just hanging out outside. Since they werent doing anything i took them to whataburger with me since i was hungry. There i mixed Sy's ""cool aid"" as he likes to call it, but i dont think i did or was....oh well. WHile we were there Addy's dad called her pissed off because she snuck out of her house and asked her where she was at and was on his way to pick her up. Poor girl was scared shitless. she wanted us to leave so her dad wouldnt yell at us at 3 in the morning at whataburger infront of all the ppl coming from Tejano Saloon. So my sister, SY and I went into hte shag wagon to watch Addy from outside to see when her dad would pick her up. WHile we were watching & waiting in the backseat of my van SY said something that i'll never stop laughing at when i remember. He said ""Damn it smells like sex in here."" I started laughing instantly and he knew right away why....hahaha...memories. A bunch of old guys in a grand am tried to pick up addy while she was outside waiting for her dad so i went out to wait with her. We talked for about 30 minutes while her dad was on his way and took his sweet ass time. I guess so it all could sink into her head, the whole situation. Sy kept yelling out the window quit mixing my cool aid...haha. She got picked up by the mean dad and went home. Oh and before anyone starts thinking bad Addy is 16...that goes to whoever calls me R.K or the other names Julian, Javi and Liz called me while i wasnt at memorial that i found out thursday night i think it was when i was over there with them. After that went back to my apartment, Sy took off in his white neon and went back to my sister complaining why i dont take her anywhere and its cool to take little sisters with me places and blah blah blah blah. THen the next two days just played BUdaki 3 at juan's and mike's house.HAHAHA i came to school today to find Cametal with his hair cut shorter than mine....on him it looks fucking hilarious. I feel like im back in middle school where cametal and I always had this short hair and thought it was the coolest thing, but then again its hard to remember those years since i was hit 5 times in the head with a football helmet while i wasnt wearing one or anything on my head durning football practice. THen the next year put a staple in my head and then crashed with juan in his mom's mini van through a wall where part of my head went through the windshield....yes i probably do have brain damage but dont want to know about it b/c things just get worse when you find out about things. Like if you had an injury or broken rib and didnt feel or know about it until a doctor told you, then it starts hurting...it happens. I'm moving back to my house this weekend more htan likely.....finally. If you want to help me move back in post up b/c i dont want to do all the damn fucking heavy lifting alone...Liz your tough, you can take in the couches....jk nah we'll let my nigger do that. WEll i got to start working on my paper....Post up bitches

I think the only two people that could maybe figure this out is Liz and Jennifer, maybe Danae cuz i was really open with her but i doubt she remembers anything i said. Liz knows some part, but not really that much. Jennifer hasnt read it but if she did it would take her only like 5 minutes to put it all together. If i've kissed you or fooled around with you before than you should be able to get it also. That goes to one girl in particular that doesnt live around here that checks up on me every now and then. Just read it slowly and think of things i've said in the pass. everyone i talk to should be able to understand it if you are someone i've had convos with. Also in their they're somethings that spell out stuff like a cross word puzzle that makes a sentence that could reveal everything. Weird right? I didnt think i could actually come up with something like this that would freak people out. Oh before I forget....I FUCKING HATE YOU...she knows who she is.

"event","Ahh another moment to type on the typer to type about my weekend and what to look foward to coming this week on the typer. Friday was a big shit night till about midnight for me. I was with Chris, Theo, Camel, Jose, Eddie,Daniel, Brandon, Raul and some other people that i just forgot their names and we all met up at the Art Awakening center by braodway hardware b/c theo and chris heard that two of our teachers were in a band and were going to have a show their that night. I didnt believe it but when we got there sure enough my Chemistry/IPC/Aquatic Science teacher was thrashing himself over his bass and Theo and Chris's DO SOMETHING teacher  was on the fucking keyboard. Only at options i'll see my teachers jamin out with the hottest lead singer ever. There lead singer was fucking beautiful. Daniel couldnt keep his eyes off her rack, but honestly none of the guys couldnt either. Then it came to my mind maybe one of our teachers were going out with her but my thoughts were wrong and she's going out with some FAt Joe look-a-like motha fucka. They sounded pretty good but considering taht i couldnt understand the words b/c it was INTERNATIONAL music and all she sang was in spanish i just had again with everyone else stare at her rack. It was $3 to get in but we all didnt have $3 tp spend so we just stood outside the window watching them while the owners were getting pissd cuz we were getting a free show. I was thinking of just walking in and saying that my teacher had me covered and would pay for all of us since it was extra credit if we showed up but that probably wouldnt have worked. 
     We left that scene and took off to HEB to get some alcohol for the rest of the night and to meet up with Becka, Jasmine and DEnisse. THe plan was to go drink at my house b/c no one is there and it's a nice place whwere we can be loud and no one would bother us. So chris and I were going to go check out the place to see if it was clear but the Mexican workers working on my house were still there and this was @ 11:30 at night....fuck the mexicans work hard for their money....hahaha. So they saw us pass by and im assuming called my dad to let him know and hten he showed up and started guarding the place. Well the girls thought i still lived there and decided to meet us there instead of HEB so my dad saw htem parked outside and sorta blew our cover which is fine b/c they didnt know the situation. They said my dad yelled at them and told them that i better not show up to drink there b/c im not suppose to be there and the girls just took off scared of the beast. So when i heard of this inccident i seriously lost it and started cussing him out and yelling at him over the phone b/c he put shit infront of my night and it was becka's birthday, kinda fucked that up too. Also Denisse was there, I love that girl, she's been one of my closest friends since 7th grade and she lives down the street from me, but freshman year she moved away to Monterrey to go to school there so whenever i get a chance to see her i get all excited. The night looked good till then but oh well so we just went over to Metal AJ's house and drank there, but it was a little weird for the girls since they didnt know AJ or the people that were with him but then again neither did I, but i still made nice and just got along with everyone. THen my night got better by one of my ex's from edinburg that i had a little thing with in the summer called and wanted me to go over to say ""hello"" since it was her birthday. SO i went over for a quicky to talk for a bit and then back to AJ's to pick up Chris and drop him off at home. That was the end of friday night, oh by the way when i say quicky, that does not mean we had sex. alright just wanted to get that cleared up a bit. And if i did i would not post that up...going on
       hmmm teacher just got mad at me b/c i was ""chatting away"" on the typer all period.....oh well
    Saturday woke up did nothing, not htat i can remember right now during the day. I just stayed home watching  college football all day hten met up with Juan and Fern for a bit to play some San ANdreas and to just kill them in H two the duce, Thats the new slang for HALO 2. Some chonger over at school said that and for some reason i cant help to say it when i talk about it. After that went over to Karla's to go say hi to Olivia, ahhh she looked soo cute behind the desk working. I remember she used to hang out with me and the rest of H.I but then i dunno what happened after that, but i miss her and it was nice to see her again. I wish she wasnt grounded so she could of hung out this weeekend, get better grades...lol. Then from there back to juans for a bit, but then left from there to meet up with Kimberely at Jason's Deli. She worked with me at SUper SPlash this past  summer and ever since then we've been pretty good friends. We met about half an hour before she would go into work so we could talk and catch up. It was cool seeing her again. Then chris rolled up in a nice white BMW that he just got friday for the weekend. Then went to my apartment where Kevin, Marty, Alyssa from mchi, Jaime, Carlos, Cametal, Compton, Christain, and nicole met up and decided on what we were going to do. They went over to Gulliermos while met up with my parents to go eat some BBQ at one my old friend's from elemntary's house. IT was her mom's b-day and they've been good friends of the family since i was born so i went by and hung out there with Vanessa for awhile. After that went to gulliermo's and had a pretty good night there. Drank a bit from whatever i could bum off of. Played a little with Jessica's dirty feet(insider). Overall that party was pretty nice cuz i knew pratically everyone there and it was cool to have my old friends and new friends together at one place where i could hang out with all of them at one time.ANA TUCK YOUR BOOBS IN!!!YOU @ JENNIFER.....haha. From there went to Whataburger had a number 6, took cametal home then went over to Mike's @ 3:30 and played about 6 rounds of H to the duce with them and i will say playing a little buzzed isnt easy at all and makes you an easy kill. THen finally went home at 5:30 in the morning when my dad was waking up to shower...haha.
       Yesterday went to grandma's house for lunch, played again H-2 with my cousins till 4, went back home and got a call from leroy informing me to meet him at 2nd and La Vista for some football. So ""geared up"" and played some 6 on 6 with senior football team from last year, cut my knee open pretty bad and sprained my ankle. After that showered, picked up Chris and AJ in my shag Wagon and went to go eat at Taco bell, dropped them off and went home to talk to Heather on the phone for about 3 hours till i fell asleep. Well shit im out of time....i'm out of here

They told me i was hired b/c i look Abracrombie, which was cool, but then they asked me if i was 18 and im not so i didnt get the job, but they told me i was more than qualified to work there but fuck. So i was at school wondering where am i going to get a job and then an annoucement over the intercom said that 6 people are need to make copies for teachers from 2:30-5 Mon-Fri at some elementary schools. SO i went and turned out 12 people have applied total but 4 were cut b/c of horrible backrounds and they're were 8 left. I doubt i'll be one of the people cut b/c i have more work experience than most of the people there and have held jobs longer than they have and also have experience with the copy machine b/c of community service hours at the fire station making copies with Liz.....lol remember those times Liz? Chillin with Danny and those two other girls that were pretty cool...good times. I'm supposed to know about that job monday. Two days ago i was at my house thinking of places where i could go apply at and at that instant I get a call from HollyWood Video on Trenton asking if i could come in for an interview at 7:45. I accepted and went last night and had the interview and got the job. I can already hear the New 2005 Mustang in my drive way Chrismas morning already.....2 jobs!! Thats more than what my dad asked for so now he's stuck with our deal if i get a job i get the car...IN HIS FACE, 2 jobs sucka!! SHit well g2g, Libarian kicking me out.

"event","TOday is Jen's 18 b-day and i havent gotten her shit. SHe has been a good friend for the past two years but lately she has been drifting off as one. I think i liked it better when she was in New Braunfules(missed spelled) because atleast when she was over there she would call everyday and we would talk for about an hour a day. Now out of five days we barely talk for 45 minutes. I dunno it's all weird, but we started drifting apart in the summer when she started to hook up with my best friend at the time, JUan. She still claims she calls me and talks to me but i dont see it happening. Now i kinda see her as my old friends from Memorial. Won't call but when they see me they act like nothings wrong or if its been like a day since they've seen me. Kinda like the Twins and Chino.I dont know why i barely started relizing this now. I think it's because its her b-day and i dont have anything for her. Then i started thinking if i should get her something, but then it would be like giving Julian something for his b-day. It would mean nothing and if i did i would feel like i could have spent the money on someone else that means more to me or that i talk to more. I dunno that sounds dick but thats they way i feel with the whole Jen situation. Just another friend i'll see when i see them. Same way with Juan and all the other guys. They're friends but not true friends. I guess they're just people i see every now and then. Now that i think of it i dont have a set group of friends. IT seems like every weekend i hang out with different people all the time. THats cool and all but i would like to have a set group. Juan and jen and the racing crew i cant depend on. Defitnely not juan at all. The edinburg people i can count on to hang out with if i call they just cant count on me because i never make it to where they're at b/c i dont like to drive in edinburg. My Options crew i can count on pretty much. They're probably the group i can count on more than anyone else. MY old memorial friends...nah cant count on them either, well except for Edgardo. Mike(Vash) and Bob i can count on, but all we play is Halo 2, which is alright cuz it keeps me out of drugs and drinking but i wont come home till 5 a.m everytime i hang out with them and that gets my parents a little upset, but i dont mind that. The only person that i could actually count on when i was hanging out with her was liz, but considering the situation now oh well. I hope your toe gets better liz from your Mass Surgery...lol. Just rub some Alavera on your neck and you'll be fine. Sounds weird but alternate treatments can work sometimes and Alavera is a sure thing. Shit well g2g

Tonight i'll be at Barnes & Noble at 6:30 then after that with Jen for her b-day, going out to eat(hopefully Kamori). After that Cruisin night till 1 a.m then back home for school the next day. If any of this sounds intresting to you call me up and your welcome to join."

"event","I've been waiting for this day for the past three years of my life. Halo 2 is now out and now tournaments will be almost every L week and every week mike, bob, me and I rudy will win almost everyone Z of them. Last month we won the Holy Spirit Team Slayer tourny, Bob won the Free for all and the free copy of Halo 2. We've won tourny's at the Vybe nunber of times, We've taken local and other teams from all over the RGV and mike and bob have even sCored their picture on the RGV mAg for winning a tourny a couple of months ago. Last night Bob L went to Hastings for a tourny there and Mike and I went to GameCrazy to win that one. Bob won his but mike lost at GameCrazy because some bitch kept stealing his kills....bastard. After that game everyone was hating on that bitch. It's alright by the end of the night we had 3 copies of Halo 2 limited Editions, some posters and the Strategy Guide(that we will never use but it looks bad ass) so i think were set for a good while and had a good night at the end of the night when we went back to mike's house to see what we all won. Three copies of Halo 2 Limited Edition cost for these games aproximately $0 spent just tournys won. After reading what i just typed i can call myself a gaming freak, well Halo freak, you can make fun of it too if you want but in the end you'll probably bethe M one paying for your copy when we got thrEe for free. If anyone thinks they can beat us or take us down in that game, like most people think until they actually try, challenge us. Another tourny at Pan AM friday, Halo 2 and a couple of other games. We'll be there if you want to play, Holy Spirit Church having another tourny for $50 gift cards to gamestop Nov. 27 starting at 2 p.m We won that last time and will win it again. Well g2g, post up if intrested in the Holy Spirt one. I can probably help you out with that one. Laterz"

Chacon didnt know how to drive my car and when he did he stalled like 3 times, so i had to take over and well it was shit from there on out

Sunday: Went to eat at Taco Ole(best mexican food in the world) with all of my dad's family, then to church again with all of my dad's family, then to my grandma's cemetary to leave her flowers with all of my dad's family, well it's their grandma and mother too. Played some Frisbee while we were there with my little cousins since the rents were just talking after putting the flowers. Then went over to juan's casa and went with Juan, Ana, Jennifer, Ashely, Billy, Noe Chaps Z06, Cassidy and me to watch SAW, which had horrible acting but since the plot was soo fucked up and awesome made up for it and was a pretty good movie to me. Then went over to Billy's house to go plan our operation ""lock out of school"" and then X-ucated it. Oh forgot before Bill's house went over to Noe Chaps house to get a little blazed then went and did our shit. Left back to juan's house at 11 p.m. Picked up my car, dropped Jen off at Alyssa's and went home to crash out. MUST EAT MORE ICE! (some ppl know what i'm talking about when they read that.)"

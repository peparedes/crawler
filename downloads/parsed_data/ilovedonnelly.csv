"event","last night was A-M-A-ZING!

finally i had a beautiful night with Mike with no fighting, crying, yelling, or anything it was great

he picked me up from my house around 4 after he got out fo work and i brought the NOTEBOOK!!! best movie ever

i made him watch it since Noah is the best guy ever and any man can only learn from him lmao

we watched almost the whole movie damn distractions lol then he took me out to get something to eat and we went over to Will's house, got Alicia and had to decide something to do

we all agreed on mini golfing which is the funnest thing ever so we raced on up to Mulligans Island and i got the pink ball!!! hehe had to fight with Alicia for it tho lol

came in third out of four.....ok me and alicia tied but o well it was still fun

"event","I'm skipping school right now... it was the last day of school, just basically a social event, which is a fucking waste of my time. I would rather be sitting at home alone than in that hell hole they call school. No one ever notices me any more, I just got up and walked out of my second period class and no one even noticed. I can't wait until exams are over so I can just do whatever I want."

"event","As I sit alone in the crowded classroom, my mind fills with blurry, dangerous thoughts. I stare back at them, one at a time. My eyes glare into their souls, shattering their insides as they read my emotions through these pain-filled eyes. They feel sorry for it, but the moment they bounce back to reality, they turn towards the person next to them and continue whispering those cruel words. Judge me if you want, I really don't give a shit any more. I'll never change who I am to meet your shallow expectations and high standards of what is truly ""normal"". I've lost control of my life, depression is eating at my insides and the only thing I can turn to is that beautiful blade awaiting me back home. The last thing I'm going to care about is what I look like. I don't care if they like me or not, all I need is someone to talk to. But I could never talk to any of them...they wouldn't understand. Hopefully one day I'll find the right one. Someone who shares the same pain as I do. I used to care about what the beautiful ones thought of me, I don't anymore. I used to be beautiful... on the outside. And everyone loved me for it. Once they found out about how ugly, self-hating and pathetic I was on the inside they stopped caring. I was less miserable once they found out who I really was, because being with them just made me feel more alone. It made me feel more alone because they didn't know me, and covering it up made me feel farther away."

"event","Only the most deranged, unbalanced, genius lunatics could identify and understand the deepest, darkest, emptiest corners of death. It comes to me unexpected. I'll be alone, with a heavy heart and hollow veins when it hits me. It comes at full blast. It chokes the air out of my body. I gasp to get oxygen to my brain, but the moment I can think clearly again... it comes back. I can't understand if I'm insane or if every other person thinks this way. Whatever it is... it scares me."

"event","our eyes meet
I stare back into his intense blue eyes
he pulls away and continues walking...
this beautiful stranger
is way too good for me
he will never know who I am
and I will never know who he really is
I see him with her
laughing and smiling...
love is so cruel
she doesn't deserve him
my heart cries out, pounding against my chest
as I watch her casually chat with him
how can he ever love her?
she doesn't realize how beautiful he is
or how much he can mean to one person...
to me..."

"event","the tear drops wash away the make up
and show her for who she really is
beneath the protective shield
she's ugly and uncertain
apprehensive...self doubting
she walks with confidence
but underneath
is terrified
of everything...
the approving glances and encouraging smiles
are a sham
for they have all seen the ugly scars
and upsetting expressions...
everything she's ever been loved for
was fake
fake is safe, and safety must be happiness...
but i was wrong"

idont know how to describe how i like him..i dont wanna like him cuz iknow he doesnt like me..but i do and hes all i think about really i cant help it i really wish he would like me and maybe it will be all good in da hood..but iono i think its impossiblee..


I love you.. the truth is I always did.. when you were comming on strong, it scared me.. I didn't want to be fragile and another one of those girls who becomes infatuted with a guy.. but honestly.. with everything I have, I want to be with you, and only you.. to hug you every chance I get.. to hold hands.. to smile.. you're my only one forever.
              

If you want to make a move then make it, if loving me is worth the risk; take it. Because it's not about being perfect; it's about being happy.

LIVE  FOR  THE  MOMENT
        even if it means you might have regrets, don't give
             yourself the chance to regret passin up a moment
             YOU             COULD            HAVE        LIVED....

iono 2 of my guy friends say i should tell him cuz its better for me to tell him and him say he doesnt like me back then possibly us liking each other and never telling each other...what do yall think

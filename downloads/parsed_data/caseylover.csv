I&#39;m thinking we are almost too old to have kids, and he thinks it&#39;s too early. We have been together for almost seven years. I just think he&#39;s scared to get give up the relaxed party life. But what can I do. I&#39;m just along for the ride. I&#39;ve voiced how I feel and some how I end up a bad guy in the conversations ,so I chose not to say anything anymore. But, I get really bummed out when he doesn&#39;t want a family with me... what if I get too old then can&#39;t have them. I know people as young as thirty that it&#39;s happen to. Or what if we do later in life and the child is not 100% heathy when it&#39;s born. That&#39;s very common for women over Thirty-three... &nbsp;Anyways that rant can continue but I&#39;m not going to allow it.
I love my job at Teach N Fun. Two and half years ago my sister Jenny opened a second location and she has gave me the opportunity to run it. We have grown so fast, I love it!
Well, I check in another day, maybe another year :)"

"event","So I am not the drinker I used to be.

Last night was the first time I have gone out since ""the break up"" and I got so drunk so fast. Maybe I should just stop drinking all together... I know it would make my mom happy.


Daniel stayed over Thursday night.  He wants to act like were boyfriend-girlfriend with out the title. I don't know how I feel about that.

But I won't say anything cause I am Daniel's lil'bitch and will do whatever as long as I get to see him.

Still in love, wish I wasn't."

"event","Heh, yeah. I'm back up with my livejournal. Not like anyone really minds or anything, I have like 2 friends on here. xD I'm spending more time here on LJ cause I've become aware of the communities here and hope to join a few. ^-^

I BADLY need an icon. Like now plz. I need to get off my tail and make one. oo;;

Lucky has gotten better at drawing people now. They're not great, but I'm happy with them. XD Maybe I can steal talent from Nikki or something. (heh heh, just kiddin')

I have become very fond of the band Gorillaz and the anime One Piece. OP has become my new anime obsession.. I hope to have fanart up on my deviantART account soon, and I'd love to tackle a fanfiction if I wasn't so scared of typing the characters OOC. Yush... and mind you, I could rant for <i>hours</i> about the gawd-awful English dub of OP. I'm so glad I found fansubs of the Japanese version. ^^ <3 *is hooked* I still love Detective Conan, too! I just think my obsession on that one has been put on a hiatus or something. XB

So, yush. Lucky out!"

"event","I've been feeling very under the weather lately, and lots of people have been wishing me well on deviantART. ^-^ Even some people who I forgot were watching me wished me get well. It makes me feel so much better, it really does. Then somebody suggested that I get a hug counter, and I thought that wasn't a bad idea. The only problem was, I don't have a subscription to dA and it won't let me post IMGs in journal entries. So I just figured that I could post everthing except the IMG counter on dA, post the counter on here, and update the number of hugs I recieve on dA in the journal entry. So, yeah. Here's the hug counter:

"event","A ton of my friends from school convinced me to try out gaiaonline.com, and I tried it because I've heard Dyani speak of it before. And I found that it looks so super incredibly fun!! Even though all I have is this black rag-like thing and shockingly blue hair. ^^;; I really want at least a pair of pants, but I find that 305 gaian gold is not worth much. I fell in love with the fox ears and fox tail, which I really want, but getting gold is hard. Nya. I want pants. NOW.

I now have a role-playing forum; anyone's allowed to join. I rped with a friend from an oekaki and I am suddenly really excited about it for some weird reason. She drew me a picture of my character in the rp, and I love it to death!! I never used to really like it, but Role Play is really fun!! ^^

One thing a lot of people don't know about me is that I'm a DJ. ^^ I recently DJed at my school's 6th grade social, and the teachers told me I was the best DJ they ever had. That's really sayin' something, since they've been there over 30-40 years. ^^ So yesh, I am really proud of myself."

"event","I'm back from Cali!! And I spent five whole days in Disneyland. ^^; And one whole day in Universal. I could go on and on and on and on and on for how my trip went. I might go back a few days on the journal and make entries on the dates of everything that I can remember. The highlights of the trip?"

"event","My, my famly needs a break, and we're getting one too. We're going to California to see my family that lives in Long Beach, LA, Northern Hollywood, and all the places around those places. I leave at 6:00 Wednesday morning, and I shall stay there for a week (yay! I get outta school for <u>four</u> days! Two of which are gym days. [Might I express that I despise physical education] XP)Anything to get outta gym. And 4 days is quite a lot of days to me; almost a whole school week.

Why we need a break? Well... This year alone, I had 3, <i>almost 5</i>, deaths in my family. It's been <i>really</i> stressful lately, and we just need a little week-long vacation. I love plane rides. *smiles* And I get to go to Disney Land and Universal Studios!! Kudos to me! ^^;;

And so this explains my future absence. But I want to get a few gifts drawn for my friends on dA before I leave, or, at least, try to. ^^;

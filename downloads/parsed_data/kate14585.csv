"event","Oh, hey.
I found this thing again. 
I knew I had one, but I couldn't figure it out...
Loving my icon at the moment. 
Oh, Mulder.
You are my little gentleman. 

I also love my teenage angsty posts. Apparently I didn't hit that stage until 19. Laughing out loud so hardcore."

"event","Yeah, I'm pretty sure I haven't written in here for a good two months. But now I'm bored, so I'll update. The week from hell is over--last midterm this morning which means that my spring break officially starts now. Debating whether or not I really want to go to work. I hate the middle school, and I'm so tired that I might fall asleep on my laptop. But, I need to save my money for Australia. Yep, I'm going abroad. Or hoping that I'm going. I don't really know if I'm going, but I want to go. Minus the plane ride--I hate planes. And with my luck, it'll crash. 

But enough about all that gloriousness. I'm looking forward to getting trizzashed tonight. Megan and I both don't have any classes tomorrow so we're going to play ""drink the beer"" a la ""Family Guy."" Pretty sure we'll win every time, and I'm hoping that I get the high score. :)

I can't hear out of my right ear very well. I don't think that's a good thing. Eh, oh well. 


Back to Aberdeen tomorrow. Yay. Or not. No one's going to be home. Hopefully, I'll be down in Towson for most of the time seein' my girls...I miss you guys. 

Okay, I'm not going to work. I'm going to sleep. and then I'm going to the lax game, because I'm cool. Check ya later."

"event","I honestly don't know what to say right now. I knew you, but not as well as most others. I remember the first time I met you--you took me and Robby to Subway. You didn't even know me, and yet you were so friendly, so warm and so hysterically funny. You were the actress, the musician, the brain, the everything. I know you loved New York. I remember you talking about it all the time. You were going somewhere. You knew what you wanted in life, and you went for it all the way. I always wished that I had known you better than I did. You made everyone laugh so much. Mike, Rose, Sarah, Jen, Ginna...all of them. And now I'll never get that chance. Never.


I realize how fragile life really is. One minute you're here, and the next, you're not. It's not something that you can control. You need to really cherish what you have, because it won't be here forever. I can't imagine losing another friend, but I know that I will. I just want you all to know how much you mean to me. You have saved me time and time again. You are the hands that pick me up when I fall down, the voices that make me laugh. You are all so wonderful."

"event","<P>I just spent a good 2 hours going through all kinds of random crap in my room. All my old papers, notebooks, pictures, Christmas and birthday cards...everything. I can't believe that I keep all of that shit, but I do. I found some cards from Ed, and almost started crying. Did I love him? Maybe. He was such a great guy. I'm an idiot for letting him go. I really am. </P>
<P>I found a card from my friend Kimm from my graduation...</P>
<P>""<EM>I hope you will always be guided by those who love you most. <BR></EM><EM>And remember, home is where the heart is. <BR>You will always be in my heart."" </EM></P>
<P>There were all kinds of pictures and notes from middle and high school. It feels like so long ago. I was laughing when I read some of the stuff that Josh Bolich and I used to write to each other during our classes senior year. I miss him. I really do. I miss everyone. I miss that year. I was so happy. </P>
<P>I guess it's just time to let go and realize that nothing lasts forever. I know who my friends are, and I know who will be there for me when I need them. They always have been. I just wasn't always aware of it. </P>
<P>This isn't supposed to be a really depressing entry. I mean it. </P>"

stressed isn't the word for it.
there is no word for it.
i'm going to fail out of college. 
kelly and i just discovered that we must take 25 classes to complete our majors and the secondary ed requirement:

- both intro history courses (4 classes)
- 8 upper level history courses (to complete the major)
- macro, poli sci, world geography and anthro (4 classes--all for the social studies certification)
- and 9 ed classes. 
- 4+8+4+9=25

mind you, a major is usually 8 classes.
ouch.
and i still have to finish all of my gen ed requirements. 
oh god. 
the children in the middle school were getting on my nerves today.
so was the teacher. she made me grade a shitload of papers and organize random crap for her.
am i her bitch?
probably. 
i have slept 6 out of 54 hours.
this can't be good. 
and you're an asshole. 
you probably don't know who i'm talking about.
but you are.

"event","Yeah, so as you can guess, I suck at updating. What's new, what's new...had an awesome weekend or two. Beach Bash on Friday--it was grand. Lots of drunken fun. Katie and I were drunk at 3:00 in the afternoon. We went and picked up her computer from OIT, and I decided that it would be fun to steal the little ""please ring bell for service"" bell...so I did. Klepto much? Eh, you all know how I am. Saturday night there was an orange fence party in the quad--so basically, as long as you were within the boundaries of the fence, you could drink and do whatever. It was grand. I was wasted. The roomie and I took a long walk and talk afterwards, and then we mealed on some leftover chinese food at 3am. Haha, always a fun time. 

As for this week, there is only one phrase that can describe it: it's going to rape me up the ass without vaseline, and all I can do is bend over, grab my ankles, and smile. I had a massive anxiety attack last night. It sucked. Today was one exam and one paper. Okay, seriously, who writes an essay question like this: ""There are reasons why colonization began around 1500. Discuss."" I busted up laughing at that...all I could think of was Linda Richman on Coffee Talk...WOO SNL! But yeah, I'm pretty sure I fucked it up hardcore. 

God, I'm so inarticulate. I wrote a paper yesterday, and I just couldn't get my point across. Not to mention the essay exams. And the fact that I can't read out loud--that's a lost cause. Yeah, I'm going to make a great teacher. What happened to me being smart? I know that I was at one point.

...and then I found alcohol. 


I went to bed at 5:45 last night, and got up somewhere around 7:45...maybe that explains the total lack of any sort of organization to this entry. And substance. 


I'm rollin'. Peace."

I was going to go with Megan down to her friend's house down on Queen Street, but her friends ended up being ready to leave before we got there, so we just stayed in Kent. Drank with Lynn, Katie, and random other people. Always a lot of fun. I don't know what I'd do without these girls. Most amazing people ever. Headed over to Middle at around 12, but didn't stay too long. PS was outside when we left. Asses. Anyway, currently just hanging around the room with the roomie. Love it.

Went to Canada. It was a bangin' good time. God bless being legal to drink. And the exchange rate. Came back to wac on Saturday. Had an amazing time on Saturday night for the most part. Note to all: never drink a bottle of champagne and then beer. THE BUBBLES! THE BUBBLES! ...they'll get ya in the end. Class started on Monday. I actually think I'm going to enjoy it this semester. My medieval history teacher is awesome, and I think I'm going to enjoy my acting class. Maybe it will make me more confident....or not. Currently, I'm sitting at my computer, waiting for m y laundry to finish so that I can throw it in the dryer. I really, desperately need a nap. Class at 4, and I haven't started reading. Will I?

Yay for shopping with the grandparents, late nights at the bars, and days at the lake! Hopefully I'll be able to fit everything in. After that, it's a mad dash to get packed, and I head down to WAC!

"event","ahahaha yesterday was awesome. it's so nice to have 3 days off in a row. let's recap, shall we? 

Sunday: spent most of the day in my pajamas, watching comedy central. i love stand up. i was dying. proceeded to actually get dressed, then went to bel air to shop with lindsey. got a sweet new purse, and some stuff for school. and chinese food, of course. 

Monday: refused to get out of bed until 12. laid by the pool for an hour, then quickly got dressed and ran up to bel air to pick up my shoes from linds. woo new shoes! stopped by target to see mike...and pick up coffee creamer. mike told me that he might have an extra ticket to the o's game that night...holla! went home, ran, lifted, then drove up to aberdeen to drop off debbie's hockey book. mike called, and i rushed home to quickly wash my hair (yeah, i definitely haven't showered since like late saturday night...), and sped down to towson. it was a fun time, full of drunks shouting things. BAD CALL! THAT WAS A BAD CALL! 

Today: couldn't get to sleep until after 4 (damn the olympics...it sucks me in!). woke up late, tried to make hard boiled eggs...did not succeed. gave up on breakfast, and now i'm in the basement getting ready to do a little lifting, then taking a shower, and maybe getting my hair highlighted. we'll see what happens. 


it's hard to believe we go back to school in 12 days. wow. i leave for canada on sunday. my aunt denise is going to be there, which is nice, because i haven't seen her in like 5 years. yeah, that sounds about right. i'm going to talk to her about going out to visit in california sometime. wooo. anywho, i better start doing some things around here. see ya."

"event","so yes, very uninteresting night. i ended up taking my little cousin to see that hilary duff movie...it was 1 1/2 hours of pure torture, although chad michael murray isn't too bad to look at. he's not really my type, though. i like dark-haired guys over blondes. but caitlin loved it, and that's what counts, although i think she was mad that i didnt buy any popcorn (i'm cheap--what can i say?)

after that, caught up with natalie and shannon, and did a little reminiscing. stole some random things...road cones, signs and whatnot...and put them in debbie's yard. we owed her since we didn't do anything over christmas. she loves us though. 

came home, and now i'm here. i should do a little reading for class, but in all honesty, i think i'm just going to put a family guy dvd in and go to bed. 


g'nite!"

"event","So the exhaust pipe fell off my car today. I had no idea what was going on--I stopped to get gas at this really sketched out Exxon station (cuz I had my mom's speedpass by accident, and why not fill 'er up?) and as soon as I got on 295, my car sounded like a plane taking off. I was just about ready to go back to the gas station and start screaming at them for having water in my tank, but I decided to just drive home. Thank god I didn't break down in the tunnel. Anyway, got home and my dad checked it out...and I have no exhaust pipe. So yeah, that was fun. 

The last couple days have been a blur of work and class, class and work. It stormed hardcore on Tuesday and Wednesday. I almost got stuck on Shucks road--it was all flooded and I had to turn around about a quarter of the way down. So I'm flashing my high-beams at people headed that way to warn them, and most turned around except this one jackass in a little red sports car who proceeded to speed up, hit the 4 inches of water I was in, hydroplane and almost knock me into/over the guardrail. I really really hope he got stuck somewhere. Goddamn mid-life crisis bald assholes. 

Yesterday, Rachel and I FINALLY found some time to get together for dinner. I miss her. We've both been so busy. Everyone has been so busy. It's crazy! I still haven't seen Kyle, and I've only seen Lindsey a few times. It's crrrrrazy! 

I continue to hate my job with a passion. It really makes me want to die inside, and I'm not kidding. Today was no exception, but yesterday was worse. Something about customers and having to be polite all the time...sometimes I just want to tell someone to get their head out of their ass and go fuck themselves. However, I would lose my job and my income, so that's not happening any time soon. 

Okay, it's time for sleep, which is pretty pathetic considering it's only 11:30. But, I promised my little cousin I would take her to go get her ears pierced tomorrow. Shit, I'm not sure if I can do it. Doesn't she need a guardian? We'll figure it out. 

Goodnight, all.



and on a random sidenote, I just saw a hot picture of Johnny Depp and nearly creamed my panties. something about him just does it for me. hahhaa. i need a boyfriend."

"event","It's been a fun few days. Some of my family came down from Canada for the weekend because my 3 little cousins were finally getting baptized. Friday night, my parents weren't around so they let me have some wine. Well, a lot of wine. I think the point was to get me drunk, but it didn't quite work out that way. My two aunts, however, were pretty hammered. It was hysterically funny. Aunt Patty just kept telling me that my mom was fun. ""Your mom, she's a fun person. She's just really fun. Really fun woman. She's so fun."" ...it went on like that for a few minutes. 

Saturday was work, and then Alex, Matt, Natalie and I went to see ""Anchorman""...which I loved by the way. It reminded me of Goulet in a way...Joy, you'll have to see this and let me know if I'm totally wrong with that comment. 

Yesterday were the baptisms. Uncle Jim came down to do them--the archbishop himself. It's sad that I'm related to someone so high up in the church. Anyway, I've never been to a baptism so funny. I'm Aiden's godmother now, which will be great fun. 

As for today, I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'm contemplating going downstairs to go back to sleep for a while. Actually, I have class tonight, which sucks. Maybe I'll go see Lindsey."

"event","So, I just got home from my class. We had an exam. I'm pretty sure I didn't do as well as I did last time. Eh, whatev. I also just realized that I have a paper due on Wednesday. Whoops...totally slipped my mind. Protestant Reformation what what? Looks like this girl will be in the librizzle all day tomorrow....ugh and double ugh.

Yesterday at work, I actually heard a man call a woman ""colored."" Apparently we haven't made it past the 60's yet. It disturbed me.

I'm in a really pissed off mood right now, but I don't know why. Actually, maybe it's lack of caffiene--I stopped drinking all caffiene and eating sugar and carbs. Maybe I'm in withdrawl. I think I'm going to settle in downstairs with a good movie and a book or something. After a nice, hot bath, of course. 

My dog just burped. It was sick. 

I'm going to go because I am pissed off."

Another enjoyable night at Lindsey's.
Who knew sober could be so fun?
(not me)
I missed lunch with Mike today. That makes me cry giant tears.
I want to go to Canada this week, but I can't.
Again, giant tears.
I'll go in August.
Linds said she'd come too.
The bars won't know what hit them.
I miss my cousin, Lindsey.
I have many a Lindsey.
Michael asked me out again.
Does he not get the hint?
Apparently not. 
This time, he wants to go bowling.
I told him to call me the last week of June.
Cold hard bitch.
My mom was being a psycho today.
Have you ever watched Roseanne? 
She's Roseanne. The control-freak.
My aunt Patty is Jackie.
I love Jackie.
Either way, I'm getting somewhat tired.
Linds says we're going swimming tomorrow.
I'm going to see The Low Life tomorrow down in Towson.
They rock.
I need money.
It's time for bed.
Comments welcome. Just write something. Make me look like I have friends.



pathetic? i'd like to think not.

"event","Let's recap the day, shall we? Got up shortly before 12 and went to Target to see my Mike. Oh, the gossip that goes on in the Target photo lab...It was grand. After that, I came home and chilled. Yes, I was a lazy bastard today. Went to class @ 5:30. Now, my class starts at 6 and goes until 8:45, so we usually take a break at 7:15. Except for today, when she didn't stop jabbering until almost 8:00. WTF mates! I almost died. I left class early and headed for Joy's bday extravaganza. The Wopperts are such an entertaining bunch, lol. God love Rick! Well then it was time for my quote/unquote date. I'm going to do this in a list form:

got to the theatre. 
michael said hello.
he asked if i wanted him to pay.
(i assumed this was how it works?)
i said yes. 
he paid.
we went in. 
i noticed a strange smell.
yes, it was him.
very strong BO. not quite my cup of tea.
we watched the movie. 
we left the theatre.
i gave him a hug goodbye.
""can i ask you a question?""
i said sure.
he asked if i wanted to be his girlfriend.
*mind goes blank*
""umm, well i go back to school in the fall, and i wasn't planning on starting any relationships.""
score one me. 
i think i saw a tear, but i can't be certain.
he left. 
i smiled. 


and that, my friends, was my day. enjoy.


i'm tired. goodnight."

"event","I've decided to make another entry because the previous one is slightly cracked-out. So today: started off to be the day from hell, but turned around. I woke up at 12, with an appointment at 1:15 with the orthopedic dude. So I go to pick up my x-rays...I was told they were at my doctor's office. Guess what? They weren't. So I go to the x-ray place. It's 12:50 at this point, and the appointment is 20 minutes away. Anyway, so I get there, and they can't find the film. Tick tick tick...it's 1:10. They find my film. I rush to the appointment, hitting every single red light on the way. I kid you not. I get to the appointment, and I wait. Finally get seen around 2:15. Turns out that I did fracture my foot, so they put me in a walking cast. It's not too enjoyable, but it's fun to kick people with. Went swimming with Jen, Phil and Rachel. Enjoyable as always. THen headed to class. Watched a movie. Got confused. Fell asleep. Woke up, left. Came home and went to Applebee's with my brother and Joy. Half-priced appetizers what what? Yeah, you love it. Ran a red light because I was waiting for like 10 minutes. It kept skipping me! It would turn green on the other side, and then for the perpendicular road, and then right back to the paralell side...never mine!!! AHHH! So now I'm home. And I'm tired. And my foot itches like fuck. But it's all good because I'm going to go to bed. Maybe a little ""Family Guy"" before that. Okay, peace out, cub scout."

"event","I went to the ortho guy today. He put me in a walking cast. Seems I managed to fracture a bone in my foot. Woo. It's incredibly uncomfortable, really hot and itchy. I hate it. But alas, I must wear it. It prevents me from working at the stadium (fuck) but it also prevents me from working the a&w side for 3 weeks (wooo!). Still gotta do the crown thing, but whatev. It's cleaner. Ha!

Got a 92 on my first exam. Holler! Makes me smile.

"event","i'm awake again. 
yes, it's only 1:30. 
however, i slept for 2 hours last night.
and 2 hours the night before. 
i caught a little nap today. that was nice. 
a giant bug just ran across the floor of my ""room."" 
sick. 
i think i'll just sleep in my real room tonight. 
i'm sure you are confused. 
i feel like the bug is crawling up my leg. 
eww. 
i'm listening to brand new. i love them. 
i like the your favorite weapon album the best. 
kudos to katie for burning it for me. 
""failure by design"" and ""last chance to lose your keys."" 
rock on. 
i don't even feel like sleeping tonight. 
i should just bring my dvd player back upstairs and watch ""the x files."" 
that would rock. 
or maybe ""waiting for guffman."" 
if you haven't seen it, watch it. it's great. 
i wonder where the bug went. 
i should probably catch up on my reading for class. 
yeah, right. 
""cheers"" is on. 
i wish i could go where everybody knows my name. 
actually, i just wish that i could go to a bar and have a beer. 
right now. 
whenever i'm down here, i feel like someone is going to jump through the window and kill me. 
i'm a very sick person. 
i spent $40 today on dinner and a birthday gift. 
i hate spending money. 
i wonder when rachel is going to be home. 
i miss her. 
yes, lindsey, i miss you too. 
and i'll give you the whole story regarding your IM later. 
i'm sure you're confused right now, too. 
there's really no point to this entry. 
i have a really short shift at work today. 10-2. 
sweet. 
i'm going to assume that the bug is gone and sleep down here. 
i don't think it was poisonous, anyway. 
ever wish like you could be someone else?
i know i do. 
i'm going to buy a lottery ticket tomorrow. 
not a real one, but a scratch off. 
maybe i'll win a few thousand and buy a car.
and pay off a little bit of school. 
again, that would be sweet.
we used to go to the mall and buy scratch offs from the machine.
we thought we were cool.
we were cool. 
don't deny it. 
goodnight.




and as for the mood, i'm not really feeling quixotic. i'm not even totally sure what that means, nor do i care. i just wanted to see what the little penguin looked like."

He brings a coke up to the register, and I ring it up. ANYway, so then he says ""umm...I was just wondering, would you be interested in going out on a date with me Saturday night?""
AWW! So sweet! Unfortunately, I have Lenny's birthdaydinner at the Rainforest Cafe tomorrow night. But I gave him my number, and he's supposed to call on Sunday night. 

Yes, he's not a total hottie. He's not ugly, though--just plain. 


Either way, I was happy. It made my day.


No other news to report, besides Mike's journal drama. So entertaining!

I was running late bringing my dad lunch. 
Then I ran over the garbage at the end of the driveway.
I didn't see it. Who puts it behind the car?
I turned in one library book. I can't find the other one. 
Fuck. 
I have to be at work in an hour.
I have a headache. 
But, Mikeyb is stopping by. I love that kid. 
He'll make me smile. 
I only had like 2 days of training. 
I'm going to fuck something up, and then the truck drivers are going to rape me.
I think I'm going to smoke a bowl tonight, because I haven't done that in forever. 
I need a little self medication. 
I think it's going to storm. That would be sweet, cuz it's mad hot outside.

In other news, the doc called me. Turns out the xray shows either a fracture, a chipped bone or something else that I forget at the moment. Yay. 

The exam today went well. I think I got at least a B, which makes me happy. Hell, I'd be happy with a D.

Staring at an endless sky?

Unaware of yourself
Who you are and where you're going
Only living
Only breathing
Losing all sense of time

The most fragile of things
Captivates and embraces you
Surrender and be witness
To this rarest of moments

You live within the sense of the order of things
What is truth
What is important
What defines you

No need to fear
No need to worry
About years that passed
About time you lost

Live the second as a lifetime
Time it does not matter
You live within the sense
Of the stillness of time

The most fragile of things
Captivates and embraces you
Surrender and be witness
To this rarest of moments

You live within the sense of the order of things
What is truth
What is important
What defines you

No need to fear
No need to worry
About years that passed
About time you lost

Live the second as a lifetime
Time it does not matter
How many years
How many years
How many years
Since you found yourself
Since you found yourself
Since you found yourself
Staring at an endless sky"

"event","I still recall the taste of your tears
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do things that I can do now
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart

Come on  tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now, I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be

Come on  tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have"

all out of rythem,
one snoring cat,
dishwasher washing.
The sound of keys click as I type.

All commonly mistaken for silence,
Just because no words are spoke,
no music playing.
No real human activity.

The sound of 2 am"

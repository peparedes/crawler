do you ever think of things that you'd like to accomplish some day before you die, so you make a mental note? well, i decided a couple of weeks ago that my life goal is to write a nice, long fantasy epic. you know, with wizards and magic and elves and dragons, and every cliche' ever used in a fantasy epic will be included. and this isn't just a life goal like ""one day i want to eat fifty hard boiled eggs without throwing up."" this is the mother of all life goals. 

i haven't played d&d in quite a while, and i'm starting to go crazy. i NEED my d&d. i'm starting to get that itch behind my ear. you know the one. i think Sean is getting one together for Friday night, so i'm definitely looking forward to that.

i've been having a real creative spree as of late. i'm writing a lot of songs, and i can definitely tell that my songwriting abilities are majorly improving. also, i'm actually writing lyrics. most of the time, i just write the music, and then scrap it because i can't think of any lyrics, but now i'm actually writing some pretty decent ones. they're not very deep or complex, but there are some good ones with some good melodies. i hope this continues for a while before i get another writers' block. i'm soooo close to having enough material for an album.

tomorrow i'm leaving for Happening. this will be my first Happening, so i'm really excited. i keep asking my sister (who has been before) why she can't tell me anything about it. she keeps saying that it's a secret, and that i'll understand why she couldn't tell me when i get there. i can't wait to go. i'm already packed and everything.

"event","today was spectacular. nothing out of the ordinary, it was just a great day. it was one of those days where you look back at what happened and the emotions you felt in the last 12 hours, and you think to yourself that you're glad to be alive.

first i went with Mike to EB in the mall and reserved a copy of GTA: San Andreas, and Mike bought this Nintendo thing that has like, 100 NES games on it. it's totally sweet. we to Wendy's and ate lunch and had some nice conversation. then we went back to his house and played video games for a while.

then i went to Amy's house and watched TV and made food and just chilled. man, i like this girl so much. she's coming over tomorrow to meet my mom and my friends and possibly (hopefully) my sister. i know they'll all like her.

g'day."

GTA: San Andreas is coming out in October. i can't freaking wait. i'm getting a PS2 for my birthday. i got a gaming magazine that had an article on the new GTA, and it looks so sweet. i think i'm going to die before it comes out.

on another note, i had this totally awesome dream, and i decided i'm going to write a book about it."

"event","yesterday i got a buttload of money for turning in some of my DVDs, so i bought some CDs:

The Ramones - Ramones
Black Flag - Damaged
The Clash - London Calling
Minor Threat - Complete Discography

i decided that it was time to start listening to some older stuff since what's coming out now is getting lamer and lamer.

speaking of lame, i saw Prisoner of Azkaban last night. if it wasn't based on a book, it would have been a totally sweet movie. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed it, but i thought that they changed too much stuff about it. like for instance, they didn't even mention that Harry's dad was part of the posse that created the Marauder's Map, which i thought was pretty important to the plot. eh, i whine too much.

and the chick who plays Hermione is totally hott."

then, Blake took his shoes back. so now i have no shoes, because i gave all of my other shoes to goodwill. David let me borrow his sandals until Monday, which was really nice of him.

and i think i totally creeped Jessie out.

i was supposed to go bowling with Sean and Micah, but of course, my mom said no because i was sick two days ago. man, she pisses me off sometimes.

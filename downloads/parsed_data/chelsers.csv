WARNING 
...before you make that first cut remember. You will enjoy this. You will find the blood and pain release addictive. Even though you think you can make a few tiny cuts that aren't deep and will heal easily ...they will get deeper. They will scar. They will take sometimes months to heal!!! And years for the scars to fade! IF you think you can limit the cutting to one area of your body think again...it will spread when you run out of skin. Be prepared to withdraw from others and live in a constant state of shame. Even if you are the most honest person ever to live ....you will find yourself lying to the people you love. You will jerk back from your friends when they touch you as if their hands were dipped in poison. You will be terrified that they will feel something under the cloth of your shirt or because it just plain hurts so much to be touched. 
Be prepared to get so out of control you fear your next cut because you don't know how bad it will be. Just wait for 10 cuts to turn into 100....Be prepared for your entire life to revolve around thinking about cutting ..cutting and covering up cutting And just wait till that first time you cut ""too deep."" And you freak out because the blood won't stop...and you are gaping....and you feel yourself shaking all over. You are having a panic attack and you are terrified but you can't tell anyone. So you sit there alone...praying it will be ok swearing you'll never let it go this far again...But you will and further. Don't worry, you will learn how to take care of your cuts so that you can go deeper and deeper and avoid the ER. And the better you get at treating your cuts the deeper they get. 
You will lie to yourself and justify it when you find youself spending 20 , 30 or 50 dollars every time you go the pharmacy. You will feel the flutter of your heartbeat everytime you go to the counter to ring up your order. Butterfly strips...3 or four different kinds of dressings...betadine....antibiotic cream..medical tape..scar reducers.....You will tap your foot impatiently hoping the line will just move and no one will stare at you or wonder why you need all these things. And at the same time secretly hope someone will notice...someone who is standing in line with an armful of the same supplies...someone who understands but of course that never happens. 
Medical supplies won't be the only thing you spend all your money on. Be prepared to buy a new wardrobe...longsleeve shirts in summer colors, bracelets, wristbands , boots... gloves..the list goes on and on. 
You will start looking at everyone in a differnent way...Scanning their bodies for any signs of SI... just hoping that you might meet someone like you so you don't feel so terribly alone. You wont even think about it ..as your eyes scan their wrists and arms...hoping just hoping they will be like you....But they are not. You will see their clean arms and feel terribly ashamed and alone. 
You will start doing a lot of things alone. You will always have to wash your laundry in private so know one sees the blood stains on your clothes and towels. You will always be cleaning up the blood..Scrubbing your bathroom floor...wiping the blood of your keyboard.... 
You won't be able to make it through a day without cutting....Next thing you know you are in a public bathroom somewhere breaking open a scab with a sewing needle that you keep in your wallet for emergancies. When you get really desperate anything will be a cutting tool ...scissors...a car key...a needle ... a paperclip..even a pen. Doesn't matter what it is if you need to cut bad enough you will find something. 
Say goodbye to things you took for granted. Like wearing shorts or sandals...pedicures...sleeveless tops. 
A normal summer day at the beach or in a swimming pool will become a far off memory for you. 
Get ready to itch. Beacuase you will itch and itch ...""so much you will look like you have fleas or a skin disease."" 
You will become an expert on your body as you destroy it carefully.. You will dream about cutting...you will dream about being exposed. It will haunt you day and night and take over your life. You will wish you never made that first cut because while you absolutely HATE cutting...at the same time you love it and can not live with out of it."

"event","I'm really stressing out lately. Just everything pushes me, little by little, but I can't go off. It's really embarrassing what I want to do right now...I just can't stop thinking about finding the sharpest blade I have and making cut after deep cut...I don't know why, I guess I just love seeing the blood. I feel so stupid and irresponsible. The second I have a little bit of stress, just one month after I get a job, and I'm steering back to my old ways. I don't want to do this...I don't think I can help it though. I want to go to this (cement) building and just hit my arm on the corner over and over...I know how it bruises as I've done it before. I want to hit my hand over and over with a hammer, to break it. I want to cut so deep that I pass out from blood loss. I just want to do something so horrible to myself, just because I deserve it, deserve it because I feel this way again. I'm too weak. I thought I was over this, I thought I was better. But I'm just too pathetic to learn anything from my past. I'm just a fuck up. Always..."

"event","I feel so alone. I hate life, especially the one I'm living. I wish I could just fade away slowly and painfully. Everything pains me, I just want to hurt myself and see the blood, feel the rush. God, how I wish life was simple. I wish I could cry, let some of the anger and frustration out...but here I sit, dry cheeks, not a tear shed. Almost like I'm emotionless, yet full of self-loathe. Why can't I just die? Be in a tragically fatal car accident. 

Life is...so difficult to live."

"event","Well, I'm leaving for St. Louis tomorrow...it should be nice, because I'll actually be around people who pay attention to me. My mom's always at work, and my friends seem to think I've dropped off the earth. Life just isn't what it should be. I hate feeling like everyone hates me, because I know it's not true, but it feels so right to say it to myself everyday from the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep. I really just wish I could die sometimes, but I know that wouldn't make life any easier for anyone. Well, except my friends, so they wouldn't have to put up with me anymore. 

I watched the movie ""The Truth About Jane"" last night. It's pretty good, I liked it, I connected so well with the main character. It's about a teenage girl who goes through high school feeling different, and she realizes she's in love with her friend, and after she tells her parents that she's gay, they get mad at her and try to change her. I just feel like that about every part of my life, like I'm always supposed to try and change myself to make everything easier on everyone else. But, I guess I'm just the person I was meant to be. And I hate myself.

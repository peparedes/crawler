"event","Ok well this past weekend really wasn't ""great"" but it wasn't bad... ok well as whoever has my journal and Kaitlins knows wat happened Sunday night. well we were waiting at Mobil cuz i guess these 2 guys wanted to meet us and wat not...so we're waiting and waiting and they never came to meet us..well they did but drove away called us back and said we were nasty ass fuckin cunts...so this message is basically for Kaitlin* or S.M. I know how u feel trust me...Im not gonna try any of that fake empathy shit on u because u don't deserve to be hurt by one of ur ""so-called"" best friends. I really DON'T mean to get the guys and I reall DON'T try or anything. its when I do try that i fail. I mean Kaitlin I am the one and every1 that knows about this says it too..that I should be mad at you because you went through my privacy even after i asked u NOT to. But i was able to ""let-it-go"" well yeah its still hanging there but I seriously lost 3 of my best friends and i can't lose another one. Kaitlin to be TOTALLY HONEST with u and I have never been able to say this to ANYONE that needed it to be said to them. But Kaitlin you ARE pretty and you've heard this thousands of times from a lot of people. but you come across to people as either scary or you like girls. And I'm not making fun of you by any means but when I tell people that you are my best friend the first question they ask me is if you are a lesbian. and i'm like NO WAY!! shes straighter than the next homophobe or another! and it sucks to have to hear that and explain it about your ""best friend"". And it is because of the way you present yourself. I am TOTALLY not dissing you or trying to agree with your mother or whatever you want to think of it but I AM right because even when I go to the counsellor she even asked me if you were ""gay"" because of the things you do or stuff like that. Like going to dance and getting pretty once in awhile doesn't make you whatever you have yourself convincing yourself you would be if you did that. That day you me and bevvy went to the mall you looked prettier than ever wearing the make-up and what not. I really don't want you to be offended or take this the wrong way but I had to tell you how I feel about this situation. Love Always-Lauren"

You Know You're From Buffalo When... 


When speaking ""the"" precedes the number or name of any highway (The Scajaquada, 
The 33, The 290)

Snow tires come standard on your car.

You can identify an ""Alden"" accent.

You have gotton frost bitten and sunburned in the same weekend

""Down south"" means Gowanda

You bake with ""soda"" and drink ""pop"".

Stop/Slow/Yield Signs..are suggestions.

You can hold an entire conversation on the best place to go for wings, a fishfry or pizza.

You see nothing wrong with watching fireworks downtown on July 2nd.

You not only know what the terms ""snowbelt"" and ""lake effect"" mean - you use them on a daily basis.

You save the Genny Cream Ale for special occasions.

You live within 1 mile of a bowling alley.

Not only do you know what it is... but you look forward to ""Dingus Day""

You never put your winter jacket away for the summer.

You like to order beef on ""weck"" and are always surprised when someone doesn't know what ""weck"" is.

You drive over 70mph on the Thruway and pass on the right.

You leave your ski lift tickets on your jacket year round.

You know how to pronouce, Scajaquada, Cheektowaga and Depew.

The rest of the country is snowbound in the worst blizzard of the century, but you still have to walk your kids to the corner to catch the school bus.

You think nothing of crossing an international border for Chinese Food.

The acid rain is clearer than your drinking water.

When you stop and ask for directions ... you expect to get them.

You don't think Canada is to the north ... you know it's to the West.

You keep the snowplow on the front of the truck year round.

You have a favorite Greek restaurant.

When someone says they are from ""the City"" - you ask ""Which one?""

You think Jimmy Griffin is a ""real"" politician

You can compute a wind chill ""factor""

You eat Orange Chocolate.

You don't have to attend the Friendship Festival to hear it!

You know the difference between imported and real Canadian beer.

You have not been on the ""Maid of the Mist"" - unless you had out of town company.

You've dined at ""Theodore's on the Lake"".

You immediatley change the channel when you hear ""Hi! this is Goldie Gardner..."".

The winter carnival gets rained out.

You call them ""Pilot Field"" and the ""Aud"" - no matter what the signs say.

You define summer as three months of bed sledding.

Your kids have watched Sesame Street - in French and Spanish.

You don't get a coughing fit from one sip of Vernors.

""Gridlock"" means driving home from a football game.

You wince when someone uses the abbreviation ""OJ"".

""Rapid Transit"" means hitting all the green lights.

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Buffalo.

"event","i feel like shit. im sick with a head cold and sore throat and i cant eat anything or else ill throw up again....even tho i went to skool todayand am going tomorrow i realli wish i dont have to. i wish we have a snow day tomorrow. im im stuck at home all alone. and im pissed about other shit thats going on and to tell u the truth i dont realli like the idea of j doing byw(backyard wrestling). he could seriously get extremely hurt and i dunt want to have to go to another hospital for at least the next 3 months. I love him more than i can explain. having him is making Ryan's death a lot easier even tho it was 3 years ago. i cant believe its been 3 years! wel 2 and a half but still. its hard to go thru ur best friends death and if i have to worry about another life going this isnt worth it. i should just end mine and i kno im being a hypocrate by saying that if ppl say they are gonig to kill themselves to just do it well i may have to do just that! so if im not seen again after today then i either am ""gone"" or i ran away. I just dont kno wat to do anymore. its not worth the pain and suffering and worying. i think that god put us on this earth to watch us suffer and laugh. he wouldnt put us here to be just gitty and live happily ever after. no way jose! he put us here for pain and i cant take it anymore! comment if u feel i shouldnt do this! 


DOUG COME HOME!!!!!!!!!"

"event","Well I havent updated in a while so I thought I would since I have nothing else better to do. Well first off I hope everyone had a great Easter. Nothing is really that new in my life since last time I updated...no new tattoo's or anything like that lol...well the highlights for this me this week....I went to a foam party at Park Central on Wed. which was a blast. Scot and a couple of his friends came up from Racine to come with me which was awesome. LOL...alot of people keep asking me whats a foam party so if you dont know...i'll try to explain it the best I can....its this big bouncy castle type thing filled with foam--dish soap bubbles--soap suds, bubble bath bubbles...bubbles...if you dont know what bubbles are you then you dont belong at a foam party...well its filled and when the machine goes on its above your head and all you see is foam, pretty much you cant breath and you pretty much sufficate and when you come out of the castle youre soaking wet. Alot of people we're there more then usual. It was fun though! On Tuesday and Thursday I worked (I work at a hotel) and the Operating Engineers that were here this week are some intresting people, they are very nice and like to give me crap but I give them crap right back...they're fun. They make the time go fast when theyre around and are pretty awesome to talk to. Some of them are pretty cute and young lol! On Friday I was suppose to go to the Somerset concert in Lacrosse but Jenn and everyone wanted to go Sat. We all made shirts and we're going to wear them and get them signed by the guys....I had I <3 Matt, Jenn had I <3 Claudio, Juan had I <3 Forrest, Travis had I <3 Mike and Eric had I <3 Somerset....we all had are last names on the back and decorated them they look pretty awesome. But anyways back to Friday, Juan and Ashley called me up and asked me to go to The West with them I wasnt going to go cuz I was tired but Juan talked me into it. Ashley didnt come though, but we got Travis and Shane to come with us. It was an ok night there I had more fun before, Travis met a guy which was cool and finally came to terms that he really did like guys, which was cool, the guy Tim that he might seemed really nice. Shane was freaked out cuz hes not gay and was wiered out cuz so he felt like he was being laughed at for being the only striaght guy in there. He doesnt judge people though. He thought it was amazing that they were so open. I dont think he'll ever go again but he said it was a good expierence to see that kind of culture, meanwhile Juan got drunk in the back of a car and was a little slutty at the club and I had to watch over him pretty much the whole night I didnt have a problem until he started being an asshole and his boyfriend found out he was there and shit was not cool. I was covering his ass telling Dillon that he wasnt there and trying to tell Dillon not to break up with Juan. Sometime I dont know what to do with Juan but I love him and he is my best friend so theres really nothing I can do. Juan and I got into a little fight well I wouldnt really call it a fight I was just pissed at him. We then headed back to Oshkosh and got home around 3 30 or so in the morning and Shane let us crash at his place for the night which was awesome. On our way home Shane sat in the front with me and we had a heart to heart conversation which was awesome, cuz me and Shane were close back then and just drifted apart and have new lives. We talked about alot which made me think of the old times. So it was good to see Shane and hopefully we can hang out again sometime. Then Saturday morning rolled around and we had to get up at 10 cuz Travis had to work at 11 so on are way home Jenn called me cuz that night we were suppose to go to the concert to see Somerset play just me and her (cuz Eric couldnt go,Juan had to work, and Travis had to work) but she was trying to get out of it and say the weather was horrible and we shouldnt drive and the weather wasnt bad what so ever. It was just an excuse to get out of it then she called me back and asked me what time we were leaving. So it sounded like we were still going so I was excited. Well on our way home Travis said that he'll come too cuz he wanted to go see Matt, Forrest, Mike, and Claudio perform so he called in sick and the manager just made him come in for a few hours then he got off at 2. Well I went to Juans to get ready and I left my cell phone in my car and on my way to Jenn's house to pick her up I listened to my voicemail and there was a message from her saying her and her mom talked and thought it was a bad idea for her to go and blah blah blah....well I talked to her mom today and her mom never said that!!!! So Im so pissed at her right now, I always do shit and do things when she wants to but when I want her to do something with me...no its always about her and Eric(her boyfriend) Just wait though Im done shes used me way to much. Im not doing anything for her or with her anymore until she realizes. I hope Im not being a bitch but Im hurt I ask her one simple thing when I do everything she wants me to. But anyways Travis and I went by ourselves which is ok cuz we had fun! First up was 21st Avenue they were ok...not really my type but they had some talent going on for them. Watching them wasnt that great though. I didnt catch the next band that was up but they were good. Hopefully they'll get somewhere, then Somerset was up and they were awesome and rocked like usual! That band has so much talent and they are probably a few of the sweetest guys I know. Well I really only know Matt and talked to Forrest a few times but still theyre AWESOME guys! But anyways yeah they rocked out like usual they had a few problems with there guitars and Matt's new bass broke so they had to switch but it didnt really matter I honestly dont think alot of people noticed, cuz they handle it really professionally. It sucked that not alot of people came to see them when theyre music is AWESOME...seriously check them out theyre on tour for 2 months...check and see if theyre in your area and go support them....you can find out if you go to www.somersetrock.com One of these days they'll make it big! Then after them we're the main attraction I guess you could call it which was The Oprahs they were awesome to from what I could tell. The singer had a awesome voice. So all together the show was fun! Well The Oprahs were on I went to the merchandise table and bought somersets cd's and some pins. and then asked one of the guys that we're selling somerset's stuff (i know the guy was from the band The Response but I dont know which one exactly....oh respose is an awesome band to...check them out too!...i think its www.theresponse.com. But anyways I asked where Matt and them were...he at first thought they were downstairs and was nice enough to take us down there but they werent really down there...so then he went outside and got them which was super nice of him! First Forrest came in and I told him about the shirts and asked if he would sign all of them, he seemed pretty excited about the shirt idea...we talked for a bit then he went out and got Matt, Matt walked in gave me a hug and I told him about the shirts and he thought it was cool. I guess Michael and Claudio were still loading so I talked to Matt for a bit then got my picture taken with Matt and Forrest. Then Claudio came in and I asked him to sign the shirts he was really nice about it and thought it was cool we made shirts. And then Michael came along and I asked him he just looked at me like I was nuts but was nice and signed them. I kinda felt weired asking them, it was weird asking Micheal and Claudio more then Forrest and Matt, cuz I really never talked to Micheal or Claudio before like I have to Matt and Forrest, but I got them all signed and bought everyone their cd's and pins and what not. The show ended and I said bye to Matt and Forrest and wished them luck on their tour and everything. I told Matt that next time hes in Wisconsin Id get him alot of people to come so who is ever in Wisconsin and want to see a good show the next time Somerset plays or if there in your area and want to see a good show go see them!!!! But yeah after that Travis and I left and well we got lost on are way home dont ask me how cuz I have no clue it took us 5 hours to get home when it should really only take us 2 hours to get home. LOL. Thats the second time me and Travis have gotten lost in our own state! Which is pathetic and funny. I dont think we could ever go on a road trip together we didnt get home til like 1 45 in the morning. Then I came home and I was super tired from this whole week...I came in my room and my grandma had a easter basket on my dresser which was sweet of her to do. My grandparents and I havent really been getting along for the past year and I havent been home cuz I dont want to fight with them but I really do love them and I am greatful for them and I do miss being around them and talking to them. I just found out today on my way out from work from my grandma that my grandpa's mom died this morning which is really sad. I really dont know her but it has to be hard for my grandpa. And I feel bad. Honestly Im scared when the day comes that my grandparents die cuz theyre all that I have as parents, those two took me in thier home when they didnt have to and have been there for me. I honestly dont know what Im going to do without. :( Well I better get back to work. HAPPY EASTER."

"event","Well I said I wasnt going to get another tattoo but as it being me I did. Juan wanted to go to Steve's Tattoo to get his belly button pierced so we went there and he got his done and if you saw his face when he was getting it done it was priceless. He made me hold his hand like I made him do to me the first time I got my tattoo, well he literally almost broke my hand only when the guy put the forceps on! I was like he didnt even put the needle in you yet! But oh well its not like I didnt almost break his hand when I got my first tattoo. Well after he was done getting his piercing I went out and just wanted to know how much it would be to get my name in japanese under my frist tattoo done. It costed 50 dollars which isnt bad, well I didnt have any money cuz I dont get paid til monday...so Juan being the sweet person he is lent me the money to get my tattoo! So I did, Jenn did it this time and to my suprise it didnt hurt as much as the first one and I didnt almost break Juans hand! hehe..So I owe Juan 60 dollars when I get paid. Then we went to our friend Carrie Swens house so she could do a presentation and we were her first ""dummies"" It was pretty fun! Then we all went out to eat and Juan ditched me to go to the movies to see the Dawn Of The Dead again with Matt. That trader so I had to drive home all by myself! I went home to Jenn's house let the dogs out real quick and got ready for work and now Im here at work. When I got here Travis was here and he and his mom got into a huge fight and Travis had all his crap in his car, he said he was moving out, I tried to talk him down I think I helped him out and made him see straight I think he'll go back home, not tonight though right now I have him in the laundry room sleeping on the cot. I told him just to go home but he didnt want to tonight and I can understand where he is coming from I did that too thought I was moving out then realized I had no money and no place to go. I hope everything works out with him. He is such a sweetheart and one of my good friends. I hate seeing my friends sad, hurt, and anything that goes wrong. Well its now 4 30 in the morning and I am so tired! I have to go home and feed the dogs and then I can finally go to bed I probably wont fall asleep until like 8 30-9 00. Tonight (Sat) we set our clock ahead a hour. I have to work again tonight 11-7 which sucks! But I cant complain cuz I need the money. Man I am so whiped out! I cant wait to go home and crawl into bed and sleep!!! :) Well I better get back to work! SPRING IS FINALLY HERE! YAY!"

"event","I havent updated in awhile so I decided that now I have time that this would be a good time to do so.Well last night I got my tattoo at Steve's Tattoo in Oshkosh by Marcus! He did an awesome job and he's freaking hot!! So it was worth the pain! LOL. I dont care what anyone says that shit hurts! I dont think Ill ever get another one again! While maybe if Marcua does it again. LOL jking. I got a japenese symbol for strength/strong willed on my middle lower back. I wanted to get something that would mean something to me not just some regular tattoo. It looks pretty cool. While I was getting the tattoo I made Juan hold my hand and after it was all done I let go of Juan's hand and it was pure red. I guess I took my pain out on poor Juans hand. Oops sorry sweetheart! After we got my tattoo done we went to Appleton and watched Dawn Of The Dead! That movie was hella good. Me and Juan we're screaming like little girls, and we were sitting by some really cute college boys! (Juan remember Ill suck your....WHAT!? LOL. haha.) That movie is spooky and its based in Wisconsin, of course this state is really messed up already! We got home probably around 2a.m. then we cleaned out my car which was pretty messy! We then watched Dickie Roberts: Child Star. That movie was pretty funny! LOL *cough cough* slut *cough* We probably didnt end up going to bed til 4 30a.m. and I had to be to work this morning at 7 a.m. So I been up ever since which sucks. This week I work everyday for 7 days straight! How fun! I dont know how thats going to go! All I know is Im going to be really really tired and wont be able to do much! But my checks are going to be good hopefully! I need money! Im broke!:( Well I better get going! Thats my quick lil update!"

"event","Well my weekend has finally ended although really on the calendar it just begun. This whole week has been crazy! My weekend started on Tuesday no wait Monday night(Juan and me went to go visit Levelle in Appleton at like 10 30 at night and didnt get home until like 4 in the morning), I dont really remember what I did Tuesday except for the last part. I went to Jenn's house and Juan came over and we got our drink on. Me and Juan were drinking shots and then after the last shot we took, Juan goes I think Im going to throw up. I felt so bad for him he trew up twice and the second time it was coming out of the kids nose! It was so gross, seeing that almost made me throw up. Jenn was kinda getting mad at us. Tuesday wasnt that special. Then Wednesday came, and it was pretty fun. I met up with Chris and Tyler at 4 30. We were heading down to Milwaukee to see Somerset play and some other bands. We finally got in Milwaukee by 7 45 or so and Tyler was hungry so we went up to Julines house where we were staying that night, and Tyler knocked on the door and asking if Juline was there? The girl at the door said no (Juline was at class) and then Tyler goes well can I come in? And the girl goes no. And Tyler goes why not I went to school with Juline and were staying here tonight and Im hungry so can I get something to eat. The girl goes I dont know you, and shut the door. Leave it up to Tyler to do something like that. So we went to Subway and they got something to eat there and after that we headed to the 8th Note where the bands were playing. When we got there Tyler of course started freaking out like usual. He was complaining that it wasnt a real concert and there's not any hot girls there and blah, blah, blah and that was just the beginning of it we werent even inside the door yet and then when we walked in Tyler freaked out even more. Going OMG we're going to get our asses beat look at these people if I knew that it was this type of crowd I woulda wore something totally different. He goes lets go back to Julines and just get drunk. He started pissing me off. So we walked out and stood outside of the place. Then Matt came over and said hi and what not then Juline came over and then the concert began. First up was The attractive Twin Sisters or something like that?? We go in there and watch them they sounded ok but you couldnt hear them sing at all. I couldnt stop laughing at Tyler cuz he looked like he was going to shit his pants he looked so scared. Then that band got done and the next band started setting up, so we went outside and sat down and waited, well I thought we were going to just wait. While we were out there I saw no other then Scot and Bert of course they were drunk of there asses. And of course they came up and started talking to me. Then the next band was up, and of course we didnt go in there because none of them wanted to. So I was pretty pissed off again, then Chris started pissing me off, he kept asking me and Tyler if everyone at the concert was gay and if people in the bands were gay and was laughing at everyone. Tyler was getting pissed at Chris and was telling him to shut up before someone comes over by us and kicks our asses. Tyler goes to Chris they are probably thinking the same thing about us, and everyone here looks the same so think to yourself and not out loud. I was so embrassed by those two. Then Somerset started setting up and we went back in. I was pissed off at them so I left them and went by Scot and Bert ( although I dont really like them I knew I would have more fun with those two). Somerset was awesome. Scot and Bert were rocking out. But you couldnt really hear Forrest sing. I think that place wasnt a real good place to hold a show. But it was awesome other then that. The Response was up next, but Tyler, Chris, and Juline wanted to leave so we left. After we got outside Tyler started complaining to me and said the music was good but everything else sucked. Me and Tyler got in a huge fight. I was telling him to not complain and be happy once in his life and just went off on him. When we got to Julines house I apologized to Tyler to keep everything ok for the night and he apologized too. Me and Tyler got pretty wasted that night and Juline was getting pretty pissed off at us. Me and Tyler were having fun and it kinda seemed like at times we were good buddies. There were so many people over there. We probably passed out by 4. But of course by 8 30 good ol Tyler woke up and screamed in my ear scaring the shit out of me. I still was feeling the alcohol and was still wobbly. We finally got on the road to go home by 10 30am. We got home around 12:50. I hung out at home all day trying to recover a bit then Juan called and asked me to go over to his house which was around 10 30 at night. So I went to hang out with Juan for a while and got home around 3. Then I Friday Juan called me asking me if I would go to the West again with him. It was actually fun after that we went to Perkins at 2 30 in the morning. We headed home and didnt get home til 5 this morning. I spent the night at Juan's we slept until 2 then Juan had to wake up because he worked at 3, so I went home and slept til 6 then fell back asleep at 7 30 and woke up at 10 00pm. And now Im at work I work 11pm to 7am for 4 days in a row. One thing I learned was never to take Tyler Riely anywhere ever again. Chris came in to my work tonight apolgizing which was nice of him and he returned one of my cd's. But I better get back to work."

"event","Hands down yesterday was one of the best days I have had in a long time. Me and Juan got closer then ever. I dont know what I would do with out him in my life. Me and Juan went to Appleton and Green Bay. We only stayed in Appleton for probably 45mins. We went to the mall to get Juans cell phone fixed and a cell phone for his mom. For the little time we were there we saw quite a few people that we went to school with. We saw Jeremy Burow who I havent seen for like 2 years and then we saw are friend Jamie. I felt so bad because I kept asking her questions that I should of already known. I felt dumb cuz shes like you already know that. Im sorry Jamie there was alot on my mind. I love you sweetheart, and Congratulations on you and Eugene. I probably wont get invited to the wedding cuz I totally forgot you guys were engaged! LOL. Im so sorry. :) After that we went to Green Bay to go see Dillon, we hung out at his house for about a hour or so then we went to the Green Bay mall and me and Juan saw another girl we graduated with working at Old Navy. It was pretty cool to see old fimiliar faces. On our way out of the mall, Dillon stopped at this candy shop and got this chocalate covered frozen banana on a stick. Me and Juan were laughing so hard. It looked like a piece of poop, then Juan goes ""its a black wiener Its Levelle's Penis"" Lol. It was the funniest thing ever. Well maybe not ever but it was pretty funny. I guess you would have to be there. Then after the mall we went to some coffee shop and played scrable. I so totally won that game! Then we went back to Dillons house and hung out there again for about another hour. Dillon and I went pretty nuts it was funny. I think we scared Juan alot but oh well. We then left Dillons at like 10 30 and went to Oshkosh and ate at Perkins. On our way to Oshkosh me and Juan had the best conversation we have ever had in our entire friendship. I finally opened up to one of my friends. Not much but more then I have ever done with such a close friend. There were tears that were shed. Juan finally learned more about me maybe more then I would of liked him to know. But I think he finally realizes who and what I was in my past and knows that the whole me being happy, go lucky, loud girl who everyone knows me to be is all an act to hide all the pain. He doesnt know the whole story behind my past but he knows more then everyone else. Only one person knows about everything in my past, and it hurts because I dont have that person as a friend anymore. We finally got back to Juan's house around 2 in the morning. We downloaded some ringtones to my phone....which include stay together for the kids- blink 182, wonderboy-tenacious d, undone, the sweater song-weezer, im a thug- by I dont remember and How many licks?-lil kim. By the time we got to bed it was around 4 in the morning or so. We finally woke up today at 2 in the afternoon today. I came home and then 2 hours later Juan calls me up asking me if I would go to Berlin with him to get applications from Movie Gallery. So we did that then went to Walmart, got hangers and hair spray, and we filled out our applications there. Hopefully we'll get the job. We both already have a job but were too expensive so we need to get another job. Now Im at home I have to work at 11 tonight. Good ol 3rd shift. 11pm to 7am. Fun fun fun. My friend Tyler called me tonight and was wondering if I was still going to the concert at UW Milwaukee...I forgot I even invited them along because I wasnt planning on going anymore. But Juan, Tyler and Chris still want to go. So I guess Im going to go with a few crazy people. Tyler is a funny guy, but you got to love that kid! Hopefully it will be fun, I think it will be. Hopefully we'll see good ol Scot there and his sidekick Bert. NOT! God I would die if I saw those two there. HAHA Thats kinda mean. Hopefully Scot wont read this. LOL If he does that kid is going to hate me forever. LOL Im sorry. But yeah Im going to get ready for work and go tanning right before work so its time for me to end this."

"event","What a friday night! Around 5:45 I got a phone call from Juan asking if I would want to go to the movies with him. I had nothing else going on so I said sure. So I got ready and went a picked Juan up. On our way there Juan was talking about this club The West and asked me if I wanted to go after the movies. I said sure why not. Not thinking we were really going to go. By the way The West is a Gay Night Club. Well we stopped in Oshkosh at the gas station so Juan and I could use the bathroom, then after that we decided to go to the porn shop in Oshkosh. Ive never been in one til last night. I felt like I was dirty for even going in one. I mean it wasnt a big deal but some of those people in there were old enough to be my grandparents so it was weird. Then after we had our fun there we headed out to Appleton to go see Dawn of the Dead which we thought was out. But to our suprise when we got there it wasnt even out. So we thought we would see Passion Of Christ,(while we were deciding what movie to watch my friend Travis called me and wanted to thank me for being there for him and told me hes glad to have a friend like me and that he loved me and we have to spend more time together before he leaves for college and he is sorry he hasnt been there for me these past couple of weeks. That phone call meant the world to me, I started crying when he told me that. It made me realize how much I am going to miss Travis when he leaves for South Carolina...Travis I love you, youre like a brother to me and are one of my best friends.) but we both chickened out from seeing that movie so we went to see the most horrible movie made.....Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. Juan almost got in a fight with these little 16 year old girls. It was kinda funny. That was probably the best part of the movie. Then after the movie we went into the game part and went on this cyber rollercoaster which was fun and then we tried to play dance dance nation which we were horrible at. After that around 11 something we went to McDonalds. Then we headed to Green Bay to go to The West. That was a whole different world. I saw my frist drag queens ever in real life. And they even performed. The whole expierence in itself was cool. I thought it would be totally weird for me to go to a Gay Night Club with my best friend who is Gay. To my suprise I saw a quire of few people I knew....Aaron a kid I went to high school with was there. I love Aaron he is such a sweetheart it was so nice to see him. Then we saw Levelle which today is Levelle's Birthday!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEVELLE!!! Youre 25 today! Aww. Then we saw Tony...Tony is probably the hottest black guy ever! Then I meet Troy, Troy is a character. Troy is very openly gay, he seems very nice. He made me laugh so much last night. The kid was practically raping me. And good ol Juan almost the whole night was pole dancing. It was so cute. I meet alot of other people there. I dont remember all there names but they are probably a few of the nicest people I ever met. After the club me and Juan went to Walmart at like 4 in the morning. I still dont know why we really even went there. Then we finally got home around 5 30 this morning. And I woke up about an hour ago at 2 or so. I am soooooooo tired but me and Juan have another day. Who knows what we'll be doing today. Cant wait to find out! All I know were going to Appleton and Green Bay. Fun Fun Fun!"

I lost your trust and its gone for good. Ive done everything to try to make it better but its too late and it will never be the same and I realize that. You were the first person I opened up to. And now I ruined everything over a picture. You say youre busy yes youre busy I understand that but is that REALLY the reason why you wont talk to me? Or is it really because of what happend? I asked you if you still want to talk? But did you only say yes because you didnt want to be rude or mean? There are so many questions in my head. I just wish you would get to know the REAL me and get passed what I did and give me a second chance. You tell me over and over dont worry about what happend. But how can I not when its so hard to talk to you when before we talked so easily? I told you I understand but I guess really I dont. But like I said Im going to leave you be, and shut my mouth and sit here and do nothing anymore. I tried and theres nothing more I can do or say to make you realize IM SORRY."

"event","Well this is my first journal entry. This past week I have learned many valuable lessons. I have learned more about myself then I ever thought I would. 

I havent been honest with myself and others. I realized that I wasnt only hurting myself but others around me. Pretending to be someone youre not isnt going to make people like you more or less. I look back when I was in high school and realize not alot of people were being real at all. You had to have the right clothes to fit in, you had to talk to the right people, listen to the right music and be mean to others even though they were your best friend in grade school, or you would be consider the ""out"" crowd. I know I did it to an extent but I think I was more liked in high school not because of the clothes I wore or who I hung out with, it was because I didnt care what people thought of me. I was the loudest person in my entire school ask anyone. I talked to whoever I felt like, no one was going to stop me for what I wanted to do or say. But then yet I never said anything when people would pick on others or stop with gossip. Which I wish I would have in the long run. So yes I am guilty too. But I learned nothing in high school really matters. Just being yourself and being real is the best thing anyone could possible do. No matter what people think about you, it shouldnt matter because you know who you are. And if people dont like it. Tough shit. 

I was looking on facethejury today. I realized that every person on there has these pretty skinny sexy model look alike types on there favorites list. No matter what people say looks do matter. Which is bullshit. People that arent as pretty or skinny or cute guy/girl or whatever can have awesome personalities. But that doesnt matter. What matters is if theyre hot enough. I just wish people would see people for who they are and not what they look like. You might be missing out on a great friendship or realationship just because that person isnt good looking enough. You should like the person for being them not for there looks. But no matter what I say things will never change. And society will always be based on looks. 

When I went to the mall with my friend we were in the abercrombie children store...and theyre making little girl clothes so skanky and slutty. Skirts are shorter then ever. Its pretty sad, but people will do anything to sell there shit. Thanks to Britney, and Christina what great role models these days. 10 year olds having sex becoming pregnant at the age of 12. 

Honestly what is this world coming to these days......"

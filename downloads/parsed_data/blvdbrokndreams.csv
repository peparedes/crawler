"event","They got a lotta girls
who know they got it going on
but nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now cant you see that your the only one i really want
and everything i need
is everything you do?

Any girl walk by, dont matter
'cause your looking so much better
Dont ever need to get 
caught up in jealousy
She could a super-model
every magazine...the cover
She'll never, ever mean a thing to me...

Shes no you... oh, no
You give me more than i could ever want
She's no you
Im satisfied with the one I've got
'cause your all the girl
that i've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
Shes no you... shes no you


dont you wish all guys were like that?!?!?!?!!? and all boyfriends would pick you over a stupid super model just because he thinks your so much more than her?



It isnt a crime to want
A little space to breathe
But you will be fine
The sun again will shine on you
Whatever you do

Take your sweet, sweet time
I will be here when you change your mind
Take your sweet, sweet time
I will be here for you baby
Anytime

ITS JUST SO CUTE!!!

Staring out at the rain with a heavy heart
It's the end of the world in my mind
Then your voice pulls me back like a wake up call
I've been looking for the answer
Somewhere
I couldn't see that it was right there
But now I know what I didn't know 

Because you live and breathe
Because you make me believe in myself when nobody else can help
Because you live, girl
My world has twice as many stars in the sky


AWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!! 


yeah i just thought these songs were so cute like if a guy played them for his girlfriend...*tear*!!!!"

"event","Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna runaway?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud 
That no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels all right
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you 
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life


With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding


There's always that one person
That will always have your heart
You'll never see it coming
Cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me

But its still in your eyes my boo
Even though we used to argue it's alright
I know we haven't seen each other
In awhile but you will always be my boo

Yes I remember boy
Cause after we kissed
I could only think about your lips
Yes I remember boy
The moment I knew you were the one 
I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there and you were my baby

Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So I will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know I cannot forget. I cannot forget

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you

I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, I hope we don't forget

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that I can share with you

So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that I've got to pull me through is memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that we can share
Falling into memories of you and things we used to do

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone


here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are

as my memory rests
but never forgets what I lost
wake me up when september ends



yes i know i just used songs from people that most people dont like but these songs are the only thing that can truely relate to how i feel right now. im sick of always putting a smile on and making everyone think im alright. even my closest friends dont know how i feel. somehow ive fooled everyone and for awhile it was alright. i just cant handle it anymore. im 15...this shouldnt be happening....i just wish there was someone that could fix everything thats happening but theres not....except for the person that is doing this to me...


Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right.
I hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. 
I hope you had the time of your life. 

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. 
I hope you had the time of your life.


ill never forget the day you played that for me and it was the first song you've played for me..."

doesn't it bug you sometimes when a friend likes someone sooooo much but no one really knows how they feel about your friend? and all you want is for them to be happy and be able to snap your fingers and the two be together? well now i know how that feels. it hurts to see someone this upset and this hurt by a guy. hopefully things will change soon for her. kate i promise everything will work out in the end if its the last thing whitney and i do."

"event","gosh im so flipping sick of always being blamed for shit i didnt fucking do. I walk in the door from hanging out with my cousin that I never get to see anymore and my mom starts bitching at me about something I didn't even fucking do. I guess one of the people that I'm supposed to be going to a concert with some how got a story that I said and I quote ""I'm going with other people find your own ride"" okay people does that actually seem like something I would say to one of my best friends?! I think not. I didn't even say that. The most I said was we'll have to figure out rides later like take 2 cars and follow one up there so we can get there at the same time and stuff we just might not be able to fit everyone in one car. THATS IT. Ok I get home and some how the story has gotten to that???? I'm sick of being the one in all these situations to turn out to be the bad person. I HAVENT DONE A DAMN THING TO ANYBODY!!! I HAVENT SAID A DAMN THING TO ANYBODY!!! if i only would have known that Gimme 5 would be playing saturday night I would be there and not having to deal with this dumb shit. I'm thinking about tearing up my ticket and going to see Gimme 5 then no one will have to worry about getting a fucking ride from me!"

anyways...the movie saw is VERY good everyone should see it. make sure u have a strong stomach though because it has A LOT of blood or be prepared to shut your eyes A LOT. theres also a really creepy clown thingy that rides out on a tricycle...gosh i wanted to shoot it. hehe.

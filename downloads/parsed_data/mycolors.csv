<font color=""#8BA77B"">MWUHAHAHAHAHA! Err....sorry for 
the sudden outburst and for not posting for awhile.

Since Erin got her computer to work with DivX we've been living 
in her small room ^^;; watching anime with Indie & Erin.....
-_- when they actually let us be alone in Indie's apartment
she wouldn't let us use the computer -_-;; well anyway....

Indie says that she'll update the site with the holiday photos
soon...and she will take more photos later too.

Well I'll let Frayne write a bit before I need to use the computer
to check my mail...</font>

<b>Frayne:</b>
<font color=""#c072cb"">Hello everyone.
Nice of you to read this, we've been pretty busy with watching
japanese animated cartoons with Indego-san and Erin-san so
we haven't had time to write here, I'm sorry.

Pretty much has happened since the last time I wrote, Tetsu and I have
celebrated the christian holiday, christmas, with Indego-san and her
family. Then Indego-san, Erin-chan and I went to watch ""Shark Tale""
Tetsu, was supposed to come too but he changed his mind a couple 
of hours before and stayed home to watch 
""Murder she wrote -The movie "" on tv, he was nice enough to tape it for 
Indego-san and Erin-san so we watched it everyone together the day
after. Then we celebrated new year and last week Indego-san was home
from work because she was sick and Erin-chan had a winter break from 
school so we have been cooped up in Erin-san's room. 

^__^ I have also been posing for Indego-san for her new manga, I'm 
actually in it since it centers around a part of my life with some really
important people to me....^____^ and Indego-san have said that
some of them might even move in with us if we're lucky!!!....
heh, Tetsu is glaring at me. He doesn't want anymore people to move in, 
and I understand him but it would be really great if the whole old gang 
could get together again *sigh*

I'm sorry but Tetsu is getting very impatiant, he wants to use the 
computer, so I guess I'll write more later. See you!

Oi, December definentily hasn't been a good month for poor Indego...
I almost feel sorry for her....first off on the day Frayne arrived (O_o)
her granddad (dad's dad) died.....then today her grandma (dad's ma) had
to put down Tuffe (her grandma's beloved cat) because he had been hit by
a car the night between sunday and monday.....and just about 3 hours ago
she heard that her grandma (mom's mom) has gotten breast cancer (but
don't tell anyone I told you, Indego wasn't supposed to tell anyone but she
told me ^^;; )....so far as I know only Indego, her mom and I know about it....
Ah well....I need to go and help Frayne comfort Indego...the poor elf-boy
don't have a clue to what's going on *sigh* ....-_-*...how troublesome....."

<font color=""#7ba75f"">Ah, hello there, haven't been online much these last couple of days. 
Indego & Erin-chan has been glued to the screen watching that
FullMetal Alchemist anime like dogs in heat ^^;;

They are really obsessing over that anime, luckily Gerd-san gave
us movie tickets so the four of us could get out of the house. By
the four of us I mean Indego, Erin-chan, Frayne and myself.

The movie was hilarious and I'd recomend it....well
anyway, I've got things to do I'll write more some other time..
ta dah!
</font>
<b>Frayne:</b>
<font color=""#a275b5"">Hello everyone,
It's around 4 am and Indego-san & Erin-san is just about to go to bed,
We have been to the theater to watch a move and then when we got
back we watched some odd anime that Indego-san & Erin-san  love. 

I don't think that it was a good movie for Erin-san to be watching, she 
is only 13 and the movie contained a lot a bad words and many references
to sex. Oh, but I'm getting a head of myself, I haven't told you what movie
we watched. It was named 'Bad Santa' and that the movie played as late as
9:30 pm should have given me an incling to what kind of movie it was.

But I never thought that Indego-san would take us to a movie like that. 
But I have to admit that it wasn't so bad that I regret seeing it, and it
was nice to get out a bit ^_^

Well, sadly, I can't write any more now because Tetsu wants to use to 
computer to write a bit on his book. </font>

Indego has finally gotten her fat ass out of the wagon and has updated
the site. And I've gotten a new hair color....my hair is now brown...
I like it better then my other hairdo. Mmm Indego has also had doubts
about letting Jubei move in, but sadly she decided that she wanted him
to come. We also have a new flatmate now, (I'm at least happy that it
isn't jubei.) his name is Frayne and he is an elf. He's okay,
he keeps to himself and also likes books so I guess I don't mind that
he has moved in....</font>

<b>Frayne:</b>
<font color=""#800080"">Umm, Hello everyone! I have just moved in
with Indie-san, Tet-san, PJ & Jack and I must say that I like it here so far.
Jack & PJ are really great and Indie-san is really nice. 

Tet-san is the one I've spent the most time with so far since Indie-san is 
at work pretty often and PJ & Jack is out much. But I can't say that 
I know him so well. I don't think he likes to talk. -_- But what he do 
like to talk about is the guy who is going to move in here after New Year. 

I don't see what Tet-san finds so frusterating and annoying about Jubei-san,
What I've heard about him makes him sound intriguing. I'm looking forward
to meeting him after the new year has started.</font>

so I have had time to read some intresting books. Oh, but she did sew
me a new top that I really like... here is a photo of it since Indego hasn't
updated the .TC. site yet. She is waiting for more stuff to update she told
me....

Grandma Lodie and congratulated her on her birthday ^_^ we got 
chocolate cake...yummy!...and then 4 of her friends came -_- one of 
them said to me ""Oh what a gorgeous girl"" -_-;; When we said that I 
wasin't a girl, she became embarrased...I actually kind of liked her, 
that lady was spunky....then when we where about to leave, Indego's 
mom and little sister arrived...so we had to stay longer, just to 
supervise....but Indego's mom wasin't ""in the fog"" like Indego's Dad 
put's it...so it all went smoothly, I was down stairs with the old 'folks 
listening to them, while Indego and her little sister went up stairs to 
play....

When we finally was on our way home we went to a mini market and 
bought some food for PJ, Jack,Totte & Tuffe (T&T is Grandma Aina's 
cats)....I wanted to stay in the car...but NOOOOO...-_- Indego
dragged me inside....luckily she was to lazy to take any photo's 
today...soo....ano, okay I need to go...indego want's to use the 
computer before she needs to go to bed......ta-tah!

"event","Hi there...just gonno make this short because Indego & Erin want to use the computer
to watch animes...Mmm...I haven't done much today...been reading most of the day 
and when Indego got home from work we rushed over to the cinema down town to 
watch ""The Invredibles"" at first I was slightly annoyed that that they had to drag me 
along to watch a kiddy movie but it was actually quite enternaining...

Well I must be going now, Ta tah!

"event","Feh, Indego got me a payed Livejournal account.....saying I would probably use it 
more then she uses her....
(here's hers by the way <lj user=indego_blue>)....oh yeah right...it isn't only mine....I'm supposed to share it with the others when they move in -_- yeah right...

Mmm....I'm not thrilled about any of the layout styles they had but Indego couldn't 
figure out how to make one of her own....so I'm stuck with this one until she does....
'cause I don't know one thing about html ^^;;...only that it's a bother...ah well....
I'm going to go do something else....Mmm I've got some book that needs to be 
read before Indego takes them back to the libary.....so....bye...ta-tah...

"event","Well last night was the Donna Stuart concert. It was amazing.. she is such an incredible woman. She is like superwoman. She does it all.. she sings, plays guitar, is so down to earth, and lives for the Lord. Jimmy Needham sang with her and has vocals on her new cd so thats awesome. 
I love when the Stuarts or Jimmy come back to the bridge. I feel like they are famous or something. It sounds stupid but I know they will be enormously famous one day. Jimmy is an amazing guy with such a heart for the Lord. His music speaks truth and i have learned so much from him just by listening to him speak or just being in his presence. The Stuarts are like the Dynamic duo, Donna plays worship and Ben speaks. They are awesome.

Anyway i cant wait till thanksgiving because that means no school and friends come back from college! I miss all of you guys! I cant wait to see yall!"

"event","I dont know where to begin. When i think about these live journals, i question why we post on them, what are our motives. But here i am once again... posting my thoughts and views on life. 

My last post was such a long time ago, there is so much to say, but i will keep it short. So far this year, basically every aspect of my life has changed. I no longer play basketball (which is what i associated myself with for the longest time), my friends have changed (not for better or for worse, things just change), and my understanding of my life has changed/grown.

The david crowder concert was amazing. If you havent gotten his new cd, do, you wont be sorry. That was definitely the highlight of the year, to be in that room, worshiping with people i dont know, people ive never seen before, but its as if i felt so close to them just because they knew the God i love. In the 4 hours that we were there, i felt more emotion than i have felt in a while. It was one of those moments where you just want to freeze and relive. 

But we cant do that, we cant just freeze life. We have to live it, good and bad, light and dark. Its in those moments that we are reminded how great our God is, and how merciful He is. Those are the moments we live for that keep us going. 

Lately, my relationship with God has not been that strong. It seems that no matter how many awesome moments God gives me, no matter how many times he opens my eyes to new things, I just dont seem to get it. I feel like a pharisee, a hypocrite. But I trust God and will continue to seek him with my heart. See thats the awesome thing about God: he says if we seek him with out entire heart, we will find him!

Anyway thats the update for now. 

Words of encouragement: live for Christ"

"event","Hey yall well the last entry was a very long time ago. That was like 2 months ago. Well sorry about that. But i have been very busy lately. Umm one thing that has majorly changed since the last entry is that school it out now. And i just got back from Australia/New Zealand/Hawaii 4 days ago. I love all of my Australian buddies - Amanda, Kenna, Casey, Chelsea, GAbby, Rosco, Adam, Evan, TRavis, and Zach. So many good times - Buggy in surfer's paradise, Gabby falling, Gabby falling again on nothing, the stairwell, Jeff's hair, makeup parties (jeff is a very pretty girl), me asking stupid questions (where is the bus stop - Evan's answer - right in front of you) my bad, pancakes in paradise, wondering the streets of w/e city we were in at that time, movie nights, throwing the gummies across the room, Gabby and me dancing in the courtyard, the late night weight room chat (that was one of my fav. nights) and we saw so many beautiful sights. It makes you wonder why we live in HOuston. Don't get me wrong i love TEXAS but man... i dont think you can top the sunsets and surrounding we saw. If you just looked, there was no way you couldn't just stop and stand in awe at god's creation. I got to do so many amazing things while i was there: skydiving, surfing, snorkeling - i got to touch a wild sea turtle, i got to touch a sea cucumber, went in a shark cage, luging, zorbing.. ah and so many more things.

Well if that wasn't enough i get to go to Memphis for a mission trip in about a week. I am so pumped about this. We are really pressed for time right now though. We really have to rely on god to work out the details for us and to know we are in his hands. But i am also very confident in TEam Memphis: Me, Otts, Mike, Andrew, Kailey, Lauren, Kaleigh, Logan, and now TK and of course i leader Kelly and Jason. If yall would just pray for us to have hearts to served the lord and for the VBS kids to have open hearts that would be so appreciated. Thanks yall"

"event","Whats up everyone! Well breakthru was amazing. Our speaker was Kenan Vaughn from Denton. He was a great guy, a country boy. But on the last night, his talk was amazing. He painted such a clear picture on how our life will be when its the end. Why do we care what happens on this earth except for what happens for christ. Thats all that matters. I had such a great time with the girls there too! I gotta give a shout out to kaleigh, otts, green, shadoo, kenna, eggie, dianna, and kelly. 
           QUOTE OF THE WEEKEND: SHADOO - ""YOU MADE ME FART""
lufkin hospital stories: ribs, hoppin on the bicycle, dead lady smoking, pregnancy pill, poor Logan
Events: two dead, burnt turtles, creek jumpin, eggie falling into the creek, knockout to the max (i seriously got tired of that game after the 30th round), ultimate uno, awesome car rides - question: if you could do anything with your life for god, no limits, what would you do? (POST THESE ANSWERS, ID LOVE TO KNOW), Gettin to know kelly carter and her 4th grade boy stories, Logans broken nose, awesome church talks, and getting to know my lord and savior

Our goal in life is to be WARRIORS for our god

NOW FOR TODAY. I just want to let yall know that our god is awesome. So this morning i woke up, and it was one of those mornings where you are like.. ugh.. i really dont want to do anything. Like i was kinda in a bad mood, not really, like the day could have gone either way. Well at school i was just like no one really bug me cuz im not in a good mood. But i was pretty down because i was down because i had just been on this amazing retreat. I was like whats up w/ this.. why am i sad? So i really tried all day to be happy and rejoice in our lord.. which i did.. but it was very hard. I was also pretty bummed because this weekend we had talked about being warriors for god. And i was really pumped to go back to school and be a warrior for god but i woke up like that. So anyway, the day is going by and i went to the library around 6. Well i picked up one of my friends and we met our group up there. On the way home, god totally blew me away. The day had been pretty much not the greatest day until now. We were in the car coming home and i started talking about how tired i was because i was really busy w/ school, work, and doing some stuff for church. And i started talking more about the bridge and she was like thats cool and she seemed interested. So i was like hey dude you should come one sunday night and she was like you know i have been wanting to get involved w/ a church for a while now. And so i got to share w/ her how god wants us to have a relationship w/ him and my love for him. When i dropped her off i was like... wow. god you are awesome. Like i was speechless. I just had to praise him right there. Our god is amazing. All day i was like lord show me opportunities to be your ""warrior"" and bam.. he did. AHH he is awesome

WELL KIDS i gotta jet now because i have book notes to do for the Great Gatsby soooo ya that will be fun. I hope everyone has a goodnight!"

"event","Well today i am very tired. I have got to stop running around all weekend! I think i was at my house for a total of 3 hours this weekend, well 11 if you count friday night when i slept. But im not complaining too much because it was definitely a blast. Friday night went to starbucks with party, lindsay, dooley, and the oaks. Then Shadoo and i headed out to the mall to pick up some stuff for the soiree (not really sure how to spell that one). Then Saturday we had our soiree. It was definitely an experience i wont forget and will be experiencing for a while - 5 months perhaps! Then saw fever pitch which was pretty cute. I liked the end - i wont spoil it for you if you havent seen it but if you did i hope u liked the end part. After that Green, Otts, TK, and i hung out at greens house. Good times there as always. Ok - i need some peoples opinions on this one. If you sleeep over at someones house and go to sleep at 12 - thats sad. And then if some other people come in and talk (very quietly for like 2 min)you cant yell at them to be quiet or go somewhere else! What is that! LOL. I love TK! Anyway, church was awesome as always, nice job Ben. And Realife was awesome as usual! I love it being just girls with all the pillows and sheets, and roses, and candles all around. Its a pretty cool thing to be a girl! Definitely way cooler to be a girl then a guy. But anyway, i had fun plannin for Cat Food round #2 after realife! I cant wait for that! Anyway - thats all i got to say, not much but hey its my life!

Maybe ill actually do something interesting for once on here instead of just tell u my life story but i havent thought of anything yet! When i do, ill let yall know!"

"event","HEY YALL! Well today was a very relaxing day. School was ok, same as usual - tired the whole day.. try to sleep in Mr. Rock's class, but he won't let you and then i had to go to bball and workout. So not that bad of a day. But after school rocked. I went home... packed a bag and then headed out to ""rugged"" Meyer Park. It was awesome. I brought my bible, bible study book, my journal, cd player, back up cds, and some water and just had a grand old time with god. I ended up spending about an hour and a half out there, just me, god, and david crowder (yaya). It was one of the best times ive ever had. If any of you get the chance to just chill in meyer park, go for it. 

But other than that, hw is the usual. Unit test coming up...grrrr. Once again, i dont know anything and probably wont till the night before the test if then. NHS meeting was today, congrats to all the officers. I cant wait till the induction... yaaaa... j/k. But hey who knows.. it may be fun!?!

Well thats it for another day in lauras life. Wasn't it exciting! 

Oh ya... hey if yall havent read James 4.. read it.. its pretty good."

"event","Hey yall! Well this past weekend was amazing. No words could ever come close to explaining what was happening in my heart and how i changed but i will try. Well as some of you may know... we had this masterpiece conference for high school and college girls this weekend. It was awesome. There was such an impact of it just being all girls worshipping the lord and learning and seeking him the whole weekend. We had an awesome worship leader, Donna Stewart and her band HopeDoor! They were so great and so talented and sang so many songs that hit my heart like a dart in a bullseye. We were taught by so many amazing ladies young and old. Kay, Donna, Meg, Whitany all great women who live their life for the lord. Its amazing how god works in your life to almost like set you up for a retreat or a conference. Like If you have questions or problems, he will answer the questions and address the problems during the weekend. God has given me such clarity and perspective through this weekend. I know i have the greatest gift of all and that is the gift of being a christian and able to walk and live my life with our god every single day. Man, I just wanted everyone to be able to experience what i am feeling, not even just right now, but everyday. Its just an awesome feeling to know that god is with you at every moment of your life. 

This weekend also brought me soo much closer to all the girls at fb. I love every single one of them and they are all so beautiful. God has given us such a power that we need to use. Every single girl is valuable in every way. God notices us. We don't need to be noticed by people because god already notices us. Out of every single person in the world, god notices us. God is just so awesome. Shannon, Melissa, Alex, Kaylie, Megan, Lauren, Kelly, you are all beautiful and a blooming lilly. So is every girl in the world... heck eveyr guy... we are all beautiful because we are created in gods mind and knit together by him. Sounds cliche but its the truth.


LORD I WANT TO YEARN FOR YOU
I WANT TO BURN WITH PASSION 
OVER YOU, AND ONLY YOU

DONNA STEWART IS AMAZING"

"event","HAPPY EASTER EVERYONE! Sometimes its hard to remember what this holiday and christmas is all about with everything that the media makes it. A lot of times Christmas is just about presents and even easter is becoming to be like that. But those two holidays are definitely more special than that. Easter is the greatest day in the history of our world. We were all saved on Easter. Jesus Christ rose from the dead. I'm not sure if everyone gets this. Jesus was dead...D - E - A - D. But he came back to life again and appeared several times to the disciples and others. I just thank god for the ability to have a relationship with him and his forgiveness. It is truly the greatest feeling in the world to know that you have a growing relationship with Christ and love him.

I hope everyone has a great Easter!"

"event","Well today was a great day, a very adventurous day! I hung out w/ miss shannon dooley all day and we had some good times. I tried to take the dual credit test today but willowchase was closed for good friday... duh... totally should have remembered that one. After that Shannon and I went exploring on our church land and ran into Kurt. Hes a nice kid. We had a good chat with him and then it was off to meyer park to plan the rafting trip. All i gotta say is that monday is gunna rock (hopefully, with some rain). 

Well spring break is winding down, tear. But ive learned that you can't totally depend on people. No matter how perfect you think someone is, they aren't. They will screw up and i think its for the best. If people were perfect, then we might idolize the perfect ones (which we shouldn't) The only person we should idolize is christ. Christ is the only perfect thing in our world and i think people screw up to remind us of that. I also am trying not to be so disappointed in some people. I want people to know and love christ the way i do, but you can't force them. It's even harder when the person is a christian but has strayed from the path. Its hard to bring them back to the road. 

But anyway, last night was awesome. I got to hang out with my sister and some of her friends. They are awesome kids and my sister is lucky to have such great friends. We went to BJ's and got some pazookies and a caesar salad?. well w/e, i guess pazookies and salads go together.

I woke up, went to church at 9:30 then taught the kiddies at 11:00, got home around 1 and then went to work from 2 to 6. After that i went to realife at 6:30 where kelly talked. It was a really good message, i had heard it before but it never hurts to be told again. When i was teaching the 4 year olds the cutest kid was there. His name was Ethan and he was the quietest kid. He reminded me of dominique off of kindergarten cop if anyone has seen that movie. He was so sweet. I want a kid just like him. Work was crazy today. So many people came in today and would not stop coming. Its a brutal job scoopin ice cream. 

Aight kiddies well im tired and i gotta do some bible study stuff so ta ta for now."

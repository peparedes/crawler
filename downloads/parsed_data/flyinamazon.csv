I took a different route on a lark, because I didn't expect traffic. It was a good thing too, PG&amp;E had blocked off my usual one. I'm guessing a tree fell and took out the power lines. A lot of trees fell, really -- I could see them all along the drive. Right now I'm thankful that I traded my little BMW roadster for a beefy truck this summer -- I could drive up my driveway even though it was under 16 inches of water. I think I should probably sweep my driveway more often. All the redwood duff swept down to the drain and blocked it. Once I cleared it, it took less then a minute to drain the water -- it's a *big* drain.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention the power was out? And the generator needed gas. Fortunately that just meant lugging a 6 gallon canister up from the shed.<br /><br />Oh, and the workshop is leaking again. We sealed its roof last year and it refrained from leaking last winter. I guess we'd better seal it again.<br /><br />This is reminding me a bit of India in the monsoon season.<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","My laptop, which holds my life crashed at about 6:30 this morning. I'd been attempting to do a final backup for about the last 20 hours. The wheezing hard drive kicked out about 9GB of its 26GB of data before keeling over. I'm not sure which 9GB it was just yet.

I have a full backup of the system that goes back about 5 months, so the majority of my photo archives are safe. My music archives are safe as well. Life has been so chaotic with traveling and moving that backups have gone by the wayside. Isn't that just the way? My trusty USB key to the rescue though -- passwords, bookmarks, quicken account, etc.

Of course a moment of corruption this morning took out my passwords and book marks. I can only hope the accounts were safe. There's about a one in three chance that the password database and bookmarks are in the data that was backed up. We'll see in the morning.

I spent the day at work disassembling the laptop and replacing the hard drive. The alternative was either sending it to one of those pricey repair shops or buying a new one outright. It's only two years old and still has a lot of life left in it yet. Now it's got a top of the line low power 120GB drive to replace its 60GB drive -- I'd wanted 80GB when I bought it.

I've just about got the system running again with base level software -- we'll see what I can do rescuscitating it with old data and the partial current backups. Thank goodness my email stores are elsewhere on a RAID-0 based server.

Funny thing is that I ordered a pair of 600GB external drives for the house last week for backups. Why a pair? Redundancy. Data should never exist in just one place. Maybe not even in just two places."

"event","<P>Two weeks ago I got back from India. A week and a half ago my furniture was delivered. Since then I've been working like made with the help of friends and lovers to fully move in. But it's a funny thing. My last house was a lot smaller than this one, and my belongings just kind of rattle around here. I've got a personal goal of getting it all cleaned up in the next month, but I've taken some pictures of what it looks like right now...

<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/000423tz""></P>
<P>The living room. It's actually a loft space that opens up onto the master bedroom and a common area on the second floor above. The camera flash doesn't do justice to the color of the slate either, it's much more subtle than that. The catalytic wood stove can heat the whole house in the winter. I seem to be utterly without living room furniture at the moment.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/000431d0""></P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00044w8k""></P>
<P>The kitchen and dining room. Notice the tres chic chairs from the patio -- I don't have any dining room chairs yet. I may well need to get a new dining room table as well. The one I have just doesn't seem to match the space well at all. The blank wall just cries out for a china hutch too. I stashed my grandmother's china in some of the copious kitchen storage yesterday.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00045aqc""></P>
<P>The roman bath. This bathroom sits on the second floor landing. The window looks out on a hillside and there are occasional deer that wander by, or so I'm told -- I haven't seen any. The bathing area is so large that no curtains are required for the shower, and the tub would probably seat five, though the angles of the tile don't look too comfortable.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00046k3z""></P>
<P>The second floor den. I thought this space was small until I cleared all the boxes out of it. In the original blueprints it was a third bedroom but they left a wall out and it became a common area. It's far more cozy than it looks in this picture. I think it needs a large love seat. The door to the second bedroom is out of site to the left.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00047x1t""></P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00048s65""></P>
The second bedroom. It looks like a small space until you realize that's a queen size bed in the loft. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the rest of the space. I'll probably put a fold out bed in it and make a social space out of it eventually.<P></P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/00049ct4""></P>
<P>The master bedroom. My bed and dresser fail to fill the space. I need at least one more chest of drawers and perhaps a comfy chair.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0004ac02""></P>
<P>The master bath, which is larger than this picture implies. The tub would probably seat four -- two slosh around in it with lots of room to spare.</P>
<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0004bq0e""></P>

"event","But not the city one. Friday&nbsp; the company I'm working with had a picnic. Apparently this involves renting a bus and going out to the county. I've come to a few conclusions about monsoon season in general. One of them is that it rains so long and so hard that just putting off living is not an option. People go out and do things in the rain that we'd put off to a nicer weekend -- they don't have a nicer weekend for months and months. So they just change the way they do things a bit.

<lj-cut text=""We met in the office parking lot""><P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0003eqhb""></P>
I've seen buses like this all over town parked along the streets. Mostly they're run by private companies. They're in various states of repair. This one's in nicer shape than most. There are curtains hung inside over all the windows and a video system that didn't work worth a damn -- we had to ask them to turn it off. The roof rack is so heavy that half the engineers climbed up there at one point and insisted that they were going to stay up there until the next stop. The driver drove about a kilometer before he made them get down -- he said it was too quiet in the bus everyone up there. In my opinion the bus was a bit top heavy.

On the way back to town the bus died climbing the final hill -- maybe 15 minutes outside of Pune. The stories vary. Either the driver did not put enough diesel in the tank and the hill gave the tank too much tilt or he put gas in instead of diesel at the last fueling. Either way, he was under the engine cowling madly priming the engine with a hand pump for about 10 or 20 minutes while we waited in the dark. Given the number of tools he had, I'm getting the feeling this is not an unusual problem. One more thing -- apparently these buses need a pilot and a co-pilot. Go figure.

The preceding four photos were taken in Pune from the bus. Not great pictures, but I managed to come to some agreement with my camera about shooting from a moving vehicle. This is not even the outskirts of town. Granted that it's not downtown, but it ain't pretty. I want to get some better pictures today or tomorrow, weather permitting. We'll have to see what's actually possible. In the first picture above you can see one of the ubiquitous auto rickshaws that clog the streets, you can also see that motorcycles are the preferred form of urban transit.

<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0003k0a0""></P>
Now we're getting towards the edge of town. This sort of lean-to is often set up even towards the center of the city. Note the blurry trash scattered everywhere.

Doh! Wasn't I here just last week? Turns out it's a hot spot of local activity. Not sure what the locals actually do other than walk around in the water, but when it's monsoon season, no matter where you go, you're walking around in the water. We tire of this particular water pretty quickly and go off to find other water.

<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0003txgr""></P>
On the way to the final picnic site the bus finds a bridge. While it's crossing the bridge traffic backs up. Two cows, a cowherd, and a couple of motorcyclists. Now this is an official picnic area. Actually its a picnic area, housing development and theme park, from what I've been told and what I eventually read on the signs. This must happen with buses all the time.

<P align=center><IMG title="""" height=480 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0003wp2r""></P>

And this would be the ""theme park"". Kind of a let down. There are a few waste cans with funny faces on them, a children's playground, a trampoline, and sporting fields, but that's about it. I'm not sure what the theme is. Best I can tell the idea is to get corporations to have picnics here in the hopes that some of the picnickers will want to buy plots of land to build summer houses. Nice idea. I did take the tour of open plots with the two people who were interested. I wish I'd gotten pictures of some of the signs extolling the virtues of living in the area. They were a definite hoot.

Let us not forget the valiant footballers who followed up the hour long football (soccer) match with a couple hours of mud volleyball. I did <I>not</I> participate. If I'd been properly briefed in what to pack, I might have considered.

<P>The concert lasted about three and a half hours. I understand that this was a compressed version of a concert that used to last seven or eight hours, which in turn was a compressed form of a concert that originally lasted 24 hours, with the music itself being keyed to the hours of the day. The two instruments in the back are <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanpura#India"" target=_blank>tamburas</A> -- four string droning instruments. Interestingly, there was the sound of tamburas even when there was no one on the stage. I asked about that. It turns out that there's a synthesizer that makes the same sound that they turn on for ambiance.&nbsp; The box like instrument is a <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonium"">harmonium</A>, which seems a bit awkward, but works just fine. The drums sound just like dumbeks though they're shaped completely different. And then there's the singer as well...

So how does all this sound? Mesmerising and hypnotic. I have years of meditation and trance work in my background and I had a hard time not ""going out"".&nbsp; I do believe that I've found one of Dead Can Dance's primary influences.</P>"

<P>Several people have been asking me for pictures, and I've been planning on taking some, but I've kinda been working. The work hours here are actually pretty long. I leave the office <EM>early</EM> and I leave at about 7:30 in the evening. Mind you, I get in before half the engineers get there, and I get in at about 9:30 in the morning, but that's still a ten hour day. That hasn't left much time for sight seeing, or recovery from jet lag either, but that's another matter.

Today I went with a few of the engineers, who hired a car (driver and all), and decided to show me what the average weekend day's entertainment looked like for city folk during monsoon season. I brought my camera. But, skipping to the punch line, I discovered that monsoons and cameras do not always mix. This left me with far fewer pictures than I would have liked, but I've culled about twenty that I'm going to share.

City folk, it seems, head to the country. Some of the things I didn't get shots of are some of the most beautiful scenery that I've ever seen in person. With the rains, there were waterfalls coming off the hills everywhere, rivers near flood stage, and roads nearly washed out. We helped push one car back out of a ditch too. I also didn't get pictures of what seemed like a small town of people standing in the spillway of a damn laughing their heads off with the fun of it, because my camera was all steamed up by then and it was raining too hard to use it anyway. Dammit. I would have loved to get some pictures of that. I stood at the very top of the spillway at the center with water rushing around my knees, with all the people below me. There were no legitimate steps or hand rails to get up there, but there was a constant stream of people climbing up. On the way back down a little old lady latched on to my elbow and I guided her down. She disappeared into the crowd at the bottom.

I think I was probably the only white face I saw all day. This is not a town for tourists.

Okay some pictures.

Hah. You thought I'd start with something beautiful in the country didn't you? Nope. The hired car picked me up at the hotel a half an hour early and everyone else was flipping late and I sat around at the office waiting for them for an hour. While I was doing it I looked at this building. What you can't quite see because I've shrunk the picture is that the scaffolding -- which even runs in through the walls is all bamboo. A multi story masonry building -- I wonder how it would fare in an earthquake?

</P><P align=center><IMG title="""" height=300 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0002rq9s""></P><P>This picture was bad news for me. It told me that my camera was not going to be able to focus from a moving car.&nbsp; Or maybe I'm not skilled enough to to get it set right. You can almost see the not quite asphalt street that's mostly rubble and the disastrous drainage.

Some of us were going to be really late.So the rest of us had breakfast in a corner cafe. From this direction it looks pretty much like any other cafe, except for the soda machine being used as a refrigerator.


</P><P align=center><IMG title="""" height=300 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0002trzy""></P><P>
From this direction you can see it opens out on the street. There is no inside. When the shop closes, they just push everything back as far as they can and barricade it. Breakfast was&nbsp;standard Indian fare. They ordered something I couldn't pronounce for me, and not having seen me eat chilies before, the ordered the sauce on the side. Later in the day they saw me eat peppers plain and were rather shocked.

</P><P align=center><IMG title="""" height=400 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/0002w64x""></P><P align=left>It seems that everyone was in a bit too much of a hurry, so I didn't get any pictures of the trip out -- the car never stopped. Our first destination was a reservoir and&nbsp; one particular stream emptying into it. Unfortunately due to the rains, it wasn't exactly a stream, and we couldn't get more than a 100 yards up it.

After we gave up, we went looking for refreshments. There's a little stand about 100 yards back down the road. We ended up standing in that little shack afterwards when our driver disappeared. It was amazingly dry. I was surprised, since it had a thatched roof, but when I looked closer I realized they'd woven a tarp into the thatch.

Of the ones that do have windows, the windows are fitted in with wedges, and the weather comes in around them. The floors are wet with the rain. We are wet with the rain, but the chairs and tables are reasonably dry. The coffee is bitter and has been boiling for far too long. The appetizers are decent, including the peppers, which shock them so much. I ate one because I felt like it, one guy did a double take, told everyone and I just said ""what?"" Because I'd told them I liked spicy food. I guess everyone says they like spicy things and no one really means it.

</P><P>I wanted to say a couple things about the car. It's a Chevy. It's the first Chevy I've been in here. No air bags. No Speakers. No idiot lights. No door open lights, none of the luxuries that we no longer think of as luxuries. We expect these things in cars. We forget the only reason some of them are there is because the government forces them to be there. Of course some of it is market pressure.

The car had been retrofitted with a DVD player for the passengers/clients. We ended up watching ""Terminator 3"" on the way back to town, much to my dismay -- it distracted me from the scenery.

"event","<lj-cut text=""More Travel Monologue"">I've been chaperoned pretty much up until this point while I've been here.&nbsp; My manager isn't here, but the manager next door happens to be. He generally handles the people here for our company, though we handle our group ourselves. We're at the same hotel, we eat breakfast together, we eat dinner together, we take a car to and from the office together...

Tuesday afternoon he left town mid afternoon. I'm not exactly clear on the reason -- might have been personal, might have been business, but it left me a bit on my own. Except Tuesday night they had an engineering dinner and I was ferried to the dinner, and then ferried to the hotel at about 11pm. So yesterday morning was my first morning alone, and yesterday night was my first night alone. In the morning it was the morning I absolutely had to be in the office by nine and the car was late and I had no way to contact anyone. Little bit of panic there.

In the evening I was so dog tired that I skipped dinner and tried to go pretty much directly to bed -- some adventure, huh? Only my room looks out on the hotel hot spot for night life. Amplified singing in Hindi piped right into my room. I was thinking I should be annoyed, but I was enjoying it and fell asleep anyway.

I've been seeing a bit more of the streets. The only American fast food chain icon I've seen is a single Mc Donalds.. I'm betting they've got a nice veggie option. My friend K makes a habit of stopping in McD's in every country she goes to -- I haven't been in one in more than a decade, but I'm just a bit curious about this one. I have not seen a single person here I would label a tourist. This is not a tourist town. This is probably a good thing. There are very few white faces here too, the few white women I've seen have often gone native. I guess that's no surprise.

I kind of wonder how they'll take to a white girl on the street with a fancy camera. I wish I had some less flashy clothing with me. Not that what I have is too flash to begin with, but jeans and tank tops, even with a denim jacket stand out badly here. I should have packed a t-shirt or two. I'm a bit concerned about the street folk. They beat on the car when we stop at intersections demanding money for papers or for wiping windows -- the few westerners are obvious targets too. I should ask if I'm going to be unmolested out on the streets if I go wandering the way I did in Israel.

The sun's come out now and then. It's quite green here. I've found a few parks in the city, and started to notice the difference between the good part of town and the bad part of town. My hotel is sort of on the border. There seems to be some sort of gentrification going on as well. There is construction going on near the hotel that is pushing back the squalor.&nbsp; Since they're putting in commercial buildings and not affordable housing I'm not sure this is a good thing, but it's just like we do it at home.

I'm holding out for the weekend here. I want some time for exploring. I also need a few more decent nights of sleep like last night."

"event","<lj-cut text=""Travel monologue""><STRONG>Squats
</STRONG>
That's what the <A href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_toilet"">Wikipedia</A> entry jokingly calls it -- the squat toilet. The pictures don't do it justice. The Indian toilets are much more primitive. Long troughs with large holes at one end and two wide rows of ridges in the ceramic for your feet. I was rather confused. I'd been in the country for two days. Granted I hadn't been outside of the hotel. More confusing were the signs all over the bathroom lecturing on the proper use of the ""western commode"" and how one was not supposed to stand on the seat. 

A Google search of ""western commode"" straightened out this a bit. It turns out that many rural Indians haven't seen a western style toilet and tend to stand on the seat and use it like a squat toilet, which spoils the seat for those using as it was intended. So the signs were all lecturing the people who didn't understand the western convenience. Problem was, the bathroom didn't have said western convenience.&nbsp;It had four stalls, all of them with squats. Each squat&nbsp;had a similar lecture on the inside of the door. I'm&nbsp;sure there's something here I'm not understanding. There's got to be. On the other hand, it could just be that this company, a consulting firm of about 3,000 people passed down a decree that notices would be posted, so they were posted. Bureaucracy can be that foolish.

To be crude though, I've taken a piss and it wasn't a problem, but I can't say that I'm looking forward to trying more than that, given that I'll need to strip off my jeans and undies and put my shoes back on before hand. Sandals. I should have packed sandals. Everyone here wears them (well, the women), maybe I know why.

<STRONG>Power

</STRONG>There were four power outages yesterday. Granted it was raining -- it's monsoon season. But it's been raining&nbsp; Apparently this is a perfectly normal occurrence. So normal that all the wall outlets in the office are on a UPS. In California when the power goes out, groans go up in the office. Here no one notices. Since the network is also on the UPS, people just keep on working in the dark.

<STRONG>Food

</STRONG>It's so damned funny. People keep asking me if I'm okay with the food here, as if I've never seen Indian cuisine before. Okay, any cuisine in its native setting is different than it is in a restaurant in a foreign country. I think the San Francisco bay area may have the largest density of Indian nationals of any part of the United States -- that probably helps a bit. I pity the poor engineer comes visiting and has never seen sag paneer or aloo matar (I'm sure they get that a lot with engineers that visit as part of outsourcing). I have sought help navigating when I can get it, but I've managed to do just fine when I don't have it. 

<STRONG>Everything Else

</STRONG>Right now there's not a lot of excitement. I wake up and have breakfast at the hotel and take the private car to the office. I work until about 1pm, Then we go to the top of the building and have lunch -- traditional Indian, eaten mostly with hands. Work until 4pm, go back up for a snack of lentils and bread. Work until about 7:30 or 8, take the car back to the hotel and have dinner. Start again in the morning."

"event","The trip's been a whirl-wind so far. I've gotten about six hours sleep in the last 48, and no more than two of those hours were together. So I'm just a bit out of it. Starting at the end, I got in to the hotel at about 5am this morning. The most unusual thing about the hotel is it's attempts at western style normalcy.&nbsp; Strangely, I have the same room position in this hotel as I had for the last night of my stay in Spain, when I spent the night in Barcelona near the airport so I could catch my 3am flight. The rooms are quite similar in some ways. 

The hotels are not. I'm looking out the window right now. The window looks out the back of the hotel on an industrial area. There are a few trees and the second floor roof extends away below my window. The roof is a dead give away at the difference. The roof is rough layers of corrugated sheet metal held down with branches and tied together with ropes. This is a business trip, to a company we work with. A coworker who's made the trip before pegged this pretty clearly as ""don't mistake this for a first world country, it isn't"".

Backing up a bit, I can tell that I'm going to describe the ass end of this trip first. (Hmmm, I can tell that my prose is a bit off too -- lack of sleep perhaps?) The trip from Mumbai to Pune was by hired car arranged by my company. I left the airport at about one in the morning, which is kind of sad, because it was dark and I saw so much less than I might have seen otherwise. There were clusters of people outside competing for fares -- it all looked very unofficial. I was warned to stay away from them, but then there was a hired car.

After a bit of time, I found the man who had my name on a sheet of paper. I followed him across the street, past the palm trees, and the rats underneath them. Yep, rats were one of the first sites in Mumbai. The airport building was surrounded by narrow winding pot hole filed streets packed with scooters and all manner of transportation. It was dark. It was humid. It was wet. It's the middle of the monsoon season.

We left the airport and hit the city streets. Calling them streets is being charitable. No lanes, no lights. Lots of traffic.&nbsp; Horns are a legitimate signaling mechanism here. Heavy trucks actually have signs on the pack telling people to honk at them. Intersections seem to be a matter of nudging in and seeing if anyone wants to hit you bad enough. Most of the roads just seemed to be either graded dirt or a long series of potholes so bad that you couldn't tell that there was asphalt. In places the concrete embankment had fallen down and rocks had just been arranged so that people drove around the problem. Most of the drive was like this. My driver informed me that the monsoons were hard on the roads. We have rain back home, and I've seen potholes materialize out of nothing, but I can't imagine two months of rain doing this.

Some small portion of the drive, perhaps an hour of the three and a half hours, was on what he called an ""expressway"". The expressway was knitted together with bits of other roads. The expressway was more what I'd recognize as a highway. It had barriers, it had lines on the road. It had consistent signage -- nowhere else was this the case.

And then there were the buildings. Every once in a while I'd see something I recognized as a modern looking building among the ruins and shanties. Mostly it looked like non-stop devastation. Through my American eyes, in the middle of the night, most of it looked like the unlivable remnants of some natural disaster. But then you'd see a light on in someone's window, and you'd know there were people there.

I wished I'd had more time, more light and my camera out. One of the most interesting sights was a shanty-like building that was a bank, and another was seeing an ATM through the door of another. Yes, people live there.

The airport in Mumbai brings to mind airports I thought I'd forgotten about as a child. Smaller. Narrower. Closed in places with fans on the walls. Airports in America were like this 35 years ago. The airport in Seoul was in many ways the complete reverse -- it was a marvelous crystalline palace of wire&nbsp; and glass. It reminded me a bit of Amsterdam's airport, but on a much grander scale. It, like much of what I saw in Europe, left me thinking that America knows nothing of architecture. India leaves me thinking we live pampered lives in castles."

</EM>""May I make fun of your address please? It's really funny. :) I'm stifling the jokes right now. Okay, I'm good. I'm sitting in an unimpressive little dinner that proves that people simply don't eat at home here. Dude going out for an English muffin and coffee ?! This is going to be the cheapest meal I have had here. I think that people partially eat out so much here because they want to be social. At home we hide. Okay, I'm a bit grossed out by how much butter is on my toast. Like I normally eat it dry. Okay, so it is actually tasty. I just couldn't do this all the time. I'll be walking all day so I can handle the calories. My thighs are firming. Yes, I can feel it. Some day I might be as buff as you. I miss you. Krissy.""

<EM>For the reader, The address she's talking about sounds like a white trash queen. I'd tell you what it is, but I did a web search and it's unique. Not only that, but the former owners were rather well known and this is the only house that is even mentioned. So we're not going to do that :)

<STRONG>Cars.</STRONG> Everything really is bigger in America. The Z4 pictured here is built in Georgia, if I remember right, but isn't even sold in the US because its engine is too small. The snubby little bimmer is a 1 series, introduced a couple years ago. Great gas mileage, and never imported to the US. The motorcycle is just damned cute and typical of the way folks use them here. I've seen a family of three on one bike. Most of the cars are smaller, and even the commercial vehicles seem to be built to size. If you don't need a big delivery truck, why can't you have a small one?

The dropzone at&nbsp;Empuria Brava has two landing areas.&nbsp;I didn't ask about it, but it makes perfect sense. The dropzone is a couple hundred meters from my hotel. Yesterday after waking several kilometers&nbsp;downtown, I noticed parachutes overhead and followed them to the beach. There was a huge bricked area, with a number of people packing their parachutes. At a place like this it only makes sense that they'd have permanent facilities on the beach.

The shops don't open until 10, or so they say. Actually they don't open until around 11, but who's counting. Downtown is sort of like a huge shopping mall. There's a large central parking area and a row of shops down either side. There are awnings and roofs over everything to keep the sun out.
</P><P align=center><IMG title="""" height=300 src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/flyinamazon/pic/000030r3""></P><P align=left>A bit more of the shopping area. Not too high brow, is it?

"event","<P>I'm in Spain at the moment and I've been asked if I'd journal it. Actually I was asked if I'd take pictures and journal them. I do have a few pictures so far, but I wanted to get the text down before I even considered doing anything about pictures. One thing I can say for sure is that you should not start a trip like this sleep deprived. I really hadn't had much more than a cat nap for 48 hours before getting on the plane. 

It's still only 5:30 in the morning as I write this. I'm beginning to catch up on sleep, but I'ms till kind of punch. You'll find this rather disorganized, I'm sure, it's mostly just ramblings...

<lj-cut text=""The Town"">Empuria Brava is on the coast of Spain about two hours by train from Barcelona. By appearances, from what I can tell, it is a retirement community. It is almost entirely marina and is a semi-circle of canals on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea. From walking around here, I can tell that the people are, in general, older -- think Florida, and that there is also a surf scene. Yesterday I walked the length of the town twice and I think I've seen most of the commercial center. I wish I could tell you that I could identify everything, but I can't. I have figured out that an ""inmobilire"" or some such is a real estate company and there are a lot of them. There are a lot of boat shops too, and a surprising number of veterinary clinics and pharmacies. I guess that shouldn't be a big shock with the age demographic, huh?

There are a lot of ""supermercats"" too, and one 'hipermercat"". I'm guessing this is a real illustration of the difference between the language in spain and the language in Mexico, where they have ""mercados"". Though I don't speak Mexican spanish, my ears have been around it for a good part of my life, and that is *not* what they are speaking here. The people are utterly and completely different -- dark Europeans, if you will. Skin tones vary around here a lot, since this seems to be some sort of European retirement community.

Empuria Brava is not a whole town, as far as I can tell. There are a few small shops selling&nbsp;a poor selection of electronics, and two hardware stores. Downtown, near the beach, is full of touristy bars and souvenir shops -- there are a couple news sellers in this mix down town, and two shoe shops.&nbsp; At a guess, the town cater mostly to Spanish and German tourists, with smattering of English and French -- Americans seem to be a rarity here. I have noticed that before I speak I'm generally assumed to be German. It must be the build.

The dropzone's a trip. Seems like a pretty stock dropzone. Except I think it may be busier than any dropzone that I've been to. They drop loads at both the beach -- I found the landing area in my wanderings -- and at the airport. There seems to be a load going every 10 minutes. This is about as hot and heavy as Perris on a good weekend, only it's the middle of the week. I will admit that they're running one big plane and a couple of smaller planes, so my observations might be distorted. I was sitting at the DZ skyping and checking my email last night and I realized that the DZ announcements are all in English. A fair number of the jumpers seem to have British accents as well. I haven't quite figured this out.

With all the walking I did yesterday -- more than 10km, I'm not sure how much more -- I have to find some better walking shoes today. The blistering was pretty bad. Yesterday's tasks were finding an international adapter for my laptop, and a messenger bag to lug it and wallety things in. I've since been informed by friends who were here last year that it's impossible to find an international adapter. I'd like to inform them that it's not -- they're available in the first hardware store ""Jamar"" next to a supermercat. They are in almost unlabeled bags in an unlabeled bin on the bottom shelf of the section with electrical plugs. I found them myself and it only took three hours.

I might also rent a boat and run through the canals with a camera. The architecture here is subtly different in ways that confuse my head. Even the bricks are different. No one's due to arrive for a couple days yet.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""The Trip"">The trip was, as my friend Cheryl says, an Adventure. It seems to me that in her mind an adventure is what you have when you are on an adventure (lower case), and things don't quite go right. I'd planned to get on the plane Monday afternoon. I'd bought my tickets months in advance. A number things have come up over the last few weeks and as a result I've gotten very little sleep and my company even offered to buy out the vacation. The weekend was spent completely focused on other things, with little time for sleep, and a great deal of physical work.&nbsp; I was still signing legal papers hours before I got on the plane. <EM>Yes, I'm being vague here, intentionally so.</EM> It's astounding that it all got wrapped up in time. It's not surprising that a few things like plug adapters and laptop carrying cases got left behind though. Gods forbid I have time for the long overdue manicure.

LWSRN dropped me at the airport three hours before my flight. It was more convenient for her this way and I really didn't want to have to deal with taxis. I got my tickets without trouble and got my Treo forwarded to the internaltional phone I was renting. My phone, which is also my organizer, does not work in Spain. I couldn't exactly leave my organizer at home, so I have to carry both. It was at this point that I realized I'd forgotten my phone's AC adapter in the chaos. Ah well, the phone part of the Treo will be turned&nbsp; off, I can only hope the rest of it will last.

Security wasn't too bad, other than picking the wrong line. I don't know where those six boys were going or why they were each carrying two laptops or why the laptops were all unique, or why they didn't think about pulling them out until the last minute, but that's what happened.

The plane was the same plane I took on the first leg of my flight to Israel. One day, someone will slap some sense into what passes for a dietitian at an airline. A muffin with a couple slices of squish is not the nutritional equivalent of the egg and meat breakfast sandwich that everyone else is getting.&nbsp;Vegetarianism is no excuse for poor nutrition.

According to the clocks I had an hour and a half to catch my next flight in Amsterdam. It was in another terminal and I needed to go all the way through customs. Customs was slow. I was a bit punchy&nbsp;from&nbsp;a lack of sleep, and after I got through, I took a side trip to brush my teeth. Other than that I went straight from one gate to the other, and&nbsp;very nearly missed my plane. I was the last person on. There were 2 people still in the gangway when I got in line. One poor soul did miss the flight and we were delayed while his luggage was removed.

The airport in Barcelona is not in a nice part of town. Mostly it seems to be surrounded&nbsp;by&nbsp;light and heavy industry. I had the directions&nbsp;from the dropzone's website about how to get there by train. The directions were a bit... optimistic. Yes, it is a single connected rail system, but they didn't mention that the start of the rail lines weren't &nbsp;quite at the airport, and were poorly marked. Nor did they mention that a transfer would be necessary on the light rail system before you got the central hub where the real trains were.

On the bright side, I got to see a lot of some really seedy parts of Barcelona -- somewhat industrial, somewhat decaying. I also spent a lot of time on outdoor light rail platforms with 100 lbs of luggage -- dragging it all through the trains was no easy thing.

Once I got to the station I wanted, which everyone called ""Sant"" but was really ""Sant something very specific"",&nbsp; I discovered that the folks running the information booths did not speak English. I was luck enough to have printed directions though. I needed to go to Figerues next. They pointed me to the right place and then I madly scrambled to figure out how to buy a ticket. None of the kiosks had an English option. Eventually I asked one of the guards and he told me to just get on the train and pay there. I'd gotten 300 euros before I'd left California, and it was a good thing.

Okay, I was on the train to Figerues. Now how to figure out when to get off. I was expecting a two hour trip, but I didn't know if it included the time to get to Sant. At one point I jockeyed all my luggage off the train only to realize it was not the right stop. and barely made it back on in time -- without one sandal. It fell under the train and there was no way to retrieve it. No matter, they were chaffing anyway. When the train cleared out a little, I opened my suitcase and got a pair of sneakers out. 

I'd gotten to Barcelona at 2:30pm, and by the time I got to Figerues, it was after 6pm. I knew there was a bus to Empura, but there was also a taxi stand. At this point I just gave up and took a taxi. The last 10km of the trip were probably the easiest, other than the bit where LWSRN took me to the airport to begin with. I got to SFO at 12:30pm on Monday, and I got to Hotel Castell Blanc at about 6:30pm on Tuesday. It was quite&nbsp; trip.</lj-cut>

"event","The trip home's been something of a death march so far. They're not showing the maps, but by the time, I'm guessing we're somewhere over the middle of Canada right now, about three and a half hours from landing. I killed my last book and have finally popped open the computer, which looks as if it may actually run until we land, if I do nothing but a bit of text entry. I've got a bit of video stashed, but right now words suit me best.

<lj-cut text=""This one's going to be a bit long"">
I didn't get to bed last night. I was supposed to leave the hotel at 3am, which made it a bit pointless. I also had drinks last night with a somewhat goofy manager from our vendor. She's a real sweety, but she's also in charge of their computer room and something went down  and she had to excuse herself around ten. When she'd proposed going out I had no idea what to expect. I ended up having a short chat with a coworker in the states that just happened to be on line and had a bit more experience with Israelis than I do, and he told me that they're just rather friendly and that it likely meant nothing. True to the situation that's exactly what it was, a friendly evening at an Irish pub ending with a handshake.  

I'll admit that one of our goals in going to Israel was to establish connections with the staff at this level -- even told Yael as much. It's a good thing all around. We got about an hour and a half, maybe two before the computers crashed. We talked about hobbies, sports we're willing to play, and a few war stories. We also talked about who had the harder job -- each of us thought the other did.

I hadn't expected to get in so early though. I'd realized with going out and getting to the airport that I wasn't going to get any sleep. Catching a couple hours didn't really seem like a good idea, so I had dinner in the hotel lobby and spoke with LWSRN on the phone long enough to realize that our home server was not on the net. A sad thing to happen right before being utterly out of contact for twenty hours. Worse yet, it looked like a problem with the ISP and I couldn't exactly sit on an international phone call with them for a couple hours getting it straightened out.

There was a about half an hour to work with before I had to leave the hotel for the airport and I used all forty-five minutes of it. I got LWSRN involved in managing our ISP, and tried to pass the tech details through her. In the end I had to get on IM with support and give them an earful. They seemed to believe it was our fault, even though they'd just restructured their network.

In retrospect, they were probably at least mostly right. In checking with LWSRN from the airport, I found out that there'd been a power outage long enough to crash the servers even with the outage. Unfortunately my UPS is old enough that there's no reasonable interface to the OS, and you just kind of have to hope that the power comes back soon enough. When the system goes down like this it usually means that there's going to need to be a manual file system check, and the server's in the hall closet, and it's monitor died on me a few months ago. That and no one else in the house is UNIX friendly means that the server's probably going to have been down at least twenty-four hours by the time I reboot it.

It's possible that it came back up when LWSRN turned the power back on. It's unlikely though. She was doing it as I was getting on the plane in Israel and it takes about twenty minutes for a file system check to either complete or fail. I'd have checked in with her when I hit Amsterdam, but my phone does not work there, and I had so little time that I ended up running from one end of the terminal to the other -- and then waiting half an hour because the there was some sort of delay that never showed up on the screens. Feh.

Stepping back a few hours to Israel, I scheduled half an hour for the trip to the airport and two hours for security, and about 20 minutes of slop. Tech support ate the slop, and then the cabbie decided I'd allowed too little time and gave me a wild ride to the airport. He was kind of right, I got to the gate  about 10 minutes before boarding started, and it could easily have not worked out at all. Israeli airport security is frightening in it's security. No surprise, really. But it's also damned bureaucratically 

Granted I'd been up been up nearly twenty hours as I went through security, but I can't help but believe they could actually make it tighter and faster at the same time. When you go in to the airport it's just a maze of ropes and x-ray machines. There are no reasonable signs about what needs to be done, nor which airlines are serviced by which areas. There are a small flat panel displays on the far side of the area, but since it's as large as half a dozen basketball courts, there's no way on earth to read them without binoculars.

Fortunately there was an information booth -- though it was unobtrusive enough that it took me a bit to find it. I told them I was looking for KLM and they directed me to a line. I stood in the line. I had no idea what I was doing or if I'd actually gotten the right line. A pair of men asked me for my passport and my tickets -- I had e-tickets, so they asked for my itinerary. It was only dumb luck that I still had it. I had thought I'd misplaced it a couple times. Then they asked me for the letter from the company I'd been visiting. What letter? Oh never mind, most don't do letters any more. I think I may have started babbling after a bit. I believe they let me through because I was making no sense, not because I'd told them what they wanted.

I stood in the line for the x-ray machine, everything had to go through it, even the carry on. This worried me, I had medicine in the carry on and didn't want it to accidentally end up getting checked or something. After the machine there was another line that lead up to a series of tables arranged  in a square. There were people behind the tables and a lot of machinery. They took passports and went through every piece of everyone's luggage by hand with swabs and ran the swabs through machines to detect explosives, and then they gave all the luggage back to me. The interesting thing about this was that I don't believe that I'd been through a metal detector at this point. I still had my cell phone on me.

After this, I managed to find the relatively unmarked lines for KLM. Slow lines. Very very slow lines. Eventually I did get my ticket though. It gets a bit fuzzy after this, but there was yet another line for passwords, where they quizzed me again, and then metal detector and x-ray machine, and another swabbing of my carry on for explosives. I did get to the boarding area eventually though.

Looking at the whole baroque process, it seems like they were trying to make up for slop with repetition. Two sets of queries about who I am, what I've done, and where I'm going, two swabbings of my luggage, et cetera.

I think I fell asleep as soon as I got on the plane. I don't remember them giving us the seat belt and exit lecture. I do remember taking off.  I've been alternating fitful dozing and reading on the plane ever since. I finished the only book I had left -- third book of the trip, I tried to find something else in Amsterdam after I realized the flight had been delayed, but no dice, so now I've got a couple hours to burn before we get in.

Are we there yet?

"event","<P><FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f0f0f0"">And what a trip it's been. The total end-to-end flight time was about 22 hours, thanks to a long layover in Amsterdam. Having to de-ice the wings for take off didn't help either. Nominally this is a business trip. Heck, it's entirely a business trip, and it's also my first time out of the country. I got my passport six months ago, but not for this, really. I'd intended to go skydiving in Spain this summer. I still intend to, but then this thing came up. 

We're here to talk to a vendor. A vendor with offices in Sunnyvale California. Why? When we talk to them there, we get the executives. Executives know selling, and they know spin, but they don't know jack when it comes to product difficulties and how to make things work. All of the engineering is done in Israel, and the occasional email was just not cutting it. Originally it was going to be me, my manager and the product marketing guy, since he manages the business connection. Just a couple weeks ago I found out my boss had bailed and I was going to be the sole engineering representative. I guess I can handle that.

The plane left San Francisco at 3:45pm on Friday. A big plane, a really big plane -- nine seats across. I think that when a plane's that big, it's got to be engineered with a little bit of flex, because I could actually <EM>see</EM> the fuselage flex several inches on take off. It was a bit unnerving. I'm used to smaller and more rigid airplanes. The flight had a stop over in Amsterdam.&nbsp; We got in at about 11am local time.

My original plan was to take a rather stiff tranquilizer that's been prescribed to me&nbsp;for anxiety, follow it with a couple drinks, and sleep -- because when I go anywhere near alcohol after taking one, I pass out and can hardly remember the experience. Usually this is a bad thing, but when you're on a plane for eleven hours, it's not as bad a thought as it seems. It didn't quite work out though. After a grand total of three well spaced drinks, I read for about four hours, slept for about three, and then woke up and read some more. I really wish that they had power for computers on their planes, but that's apparently only in business class, and even then only on their newest planes.

The flight was a KLM flight -- I recommend them, not because they are fancy, but because they are polite. It was a bit disorienting at first though. My international experience started immediately -- all the announcements were in Dutch, followed by an English translation. Getting a drink was kind of interesting too. Europeans don't seem to differentiate between scotch and bourbon -- it's all whiskey to them. No little plastic bottles either. I ordered a ""double bourbon"" at first, hoping to drift off to sleep quickly and was informed that they didn't serve doubles -- okay, I can deal. Then the steward pulled a large and somewhat worn bottle of Dewars (not bourbon), out of the bottom drawer of his cart and poured me a shot over ice. For a blended scotch, it was not bad at all.

They wanted to serve dinner immediately. Never mind that it was about four in the afternoon local time. Being vegetarian, I had ordered a special meal -- this left me eating about half an hour before my seat mate was served. We really lucked out, I think we had the the only empty seat in the plane between us. She was quite luscious too -- in a sort of Britney Spears sort of way. She spent almost the whole flight with her coat over her head sleeping though.

I had an eight hour layover in Amsterdam. LWSRN's friend A lives there, we've met a few times and enjoyed ourselves. She happened to be at the airport picking up a friend, and in the end five of us went out to lunch&nbsp; at an odd little restaurant that seemed to be mostly made of plywood and sat on what looked like marshes. (It probably was sitting on marshes now that I think about it -- a good bit of The Netherlands is under water.) The food was fabulous though. The scenery during lunch was too. They are starting an adventure magazine of some sort, so I pulled out my laptop and showed off a few of my skydiving pictures. I think LWSRN and I may end up writing something on skydiving for them.

Afterwards A and I took a tour of Amsterdam via the canals.&nbsp; It's an astounding city. It deserves a few months just to soak everything in. Then she put me on a train back to the airport and I continued on to Israel.

Getting on the plane to Israel was a bit of an experience. They did quite an interrogation of my reasons for going. They took each passenger to a podium and quized them. They asked the people in front of me how long they had known each other and when the answer was <EM>only<FONT style=""BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f0f0f0""></EM></FONT> five months, they separated them and quized them individually. I must have given the right answers because they let me continue. The folded my boarding pass into my passport though and I didn't realize it. Fortunately they could re-issue it.

I'm a bit sad that my time in Amsterdam is so fuzzy. That tranquilizer I'd taken about 18 hours prior and a lack of sleep definitely had its effect on me. I slept most of the way to Tel Aviv though. It was a shorter flight, but I'm sure it was longer than I realize, but it seemed quite quick.

The Tel Aviv airport is new, at least according to my taxi driver. It was also empty at 2:30am when we got in. It's quite an impressive place -- huge slabs of stone, some certainly lime stone, some maybe sandstone. Long ramps that left me feeling like they were meant to move the stones of the pyramids connected the parts of the airport. I'm sure it's just the feeling they were trying to get. They quizzed me again before they let me through customs. I really don't think I look like I'm up to no good, but they seemed to think so. Why ask what company I'm doing business with if you're not going to write anything down? So strange.

A woman came up to me in the baggage area. I recognized her from the KLM counter in San Francisco. She must have overheard me tell LWSRN where I was staying, because she wanted to share a cab. I told her she could, but I needed to find a money machine before I left, She told me she'd wait through the next set of doors. I never saw her again -- checked outside every entrance and went end to end in the baggage area. I feel a bit guilty -- she seemed like a nice old lady.

And the money machine. Oh yes. One think I forgot to check out before I left was exchange rates. I hadn't realized that The Netherlands was&nbsp; on the Euro -- not that A let me pay for anything. (Such a sweety, I owe her a thank you), but I was only there for a few hours. I had utterly no clue about how many dollars to the shekel. I found an ATM, and thankfully it had a button for English. I told it I wanted to get money out and it blithely put up a list of all my choices. In shekels. Someone told me before I left that the equivalent of $200USD would probably be enough. So exactly how much was that? I had no clue and it was nearing three in the morning. I just pushed ""300"", since that was the largest figure the machine would dispense. A couple minutes later I walked past one of those big currency exchange rate boards. Turns out that there are exactly four and a half shekels to the dollar. Every other exchange rate listed had lots of numbers after the decimal point. I can only guess that the exchange rate is fixed.

So, walk outside with my luggage and instantly there are half a dozen men who were just hanging around asking me if I need a taxi. Why yes I do, but why don't you wait just a minute -- I was looking around for the little old lady. I wandered back into baggage area, and noticed that the ""taxi"" sign was over a different door. This door had a rather normal queue of taxis outside of it, and no men casually hanging around. It looked like a much better bet.

It's hard to tell a lot about a city in the middle of the night when you've been sleeping on airplanes and aren't completely coherent. I <EM>think</EM> that the Sheraton is on the far side of Tel Aviv from the airport, but it's hard to be certain. The cab driver ended up in some windy little streets that seemed like they'd have been more at home in an old city somewhere in Europe than Tel Aviv. If I were in the US, I'd think that he was running up the meter, but he'd given me a flat rate of 130 shekels, which given the length of the ride seemed reasonable enough.

So I got situated at the hotel and realized I had no idea how to make a call out on my cell phone -- it works here, but dialing ended up getting me a woman's voice in hebrew telling me something. I don't know what, I don't speak the language. By the time I got down to the business center in the hotel and arranged for wireless access, LWSRN had given up and called me directly -- which worked just fine. She put me on ""speaker"" so that she and kitten could talk to me together, we chatted a bit and then&nbsp;I tried to go to bed (it being after four by this time). It didn't work. I turned on the TV and watched the end of The Green Mile again (that's twice I've seen the end -- I should see the rest of it sometime) with hebrew subtitles, and crashed around 5am.

LWSRN and kitten woke me at about 11am, they were on their way to bed. I was groggy and incoherent, but they did me a favor, I really needed to get up. I'd planned to get in a day early to leave me time to adjust to the time schedule, and that requires actually doing things like getting up in the morning and going to sleep at night.

I've lucked out with the hotel room. I'm on the 6th floor, overlooking a beach and the Mediterranean. I could wish it was a bit warmer. I've got the balcony door open just a tiny bit right now so I can smell the breeze, but it's about 5 degrees too cool to throw the door all the way open. I've got a chair turned around so I can look out over the sea as I type. This is pleasant. Really really pleasant.

My electrical planning worked out just fine -- everything plugs into the wall as it should. LWSRNs loving packing job has been perfect and everything I've wanted is just where it ought to be. After a week of stress and freaking out, I may just be beginning to enjoy myself.

My coworker should be getting in to the hotel any minute now. We'll do dinner and a bit of planning, and then meet with our vendor in the morning. I've been invited to a customer site visit Tuesday, I still don't know if I'll do that or try to do a skydive. It just all depends on how adventuresome I get.

There is so much I've left out of this. Everything is different, and yet people are still people. Door knobs, power outlets, odd electrical features on elevators that automate behavior so that no one works on the sabbath. The room even has something called a ""Sabbath Clock"" -- not sure what it does. I suspect it automates lights -- even turning a light switch is considered labor by some. Cars are different, manners are different. It took forever for me to figure out how to open the balcony door -- it's a design I've never seen.

In America everything is standardized, maybe it's true here too, but they are different standards. So strange.

"event","There is a nameless need in me and it aches. I sometimes imagine it feels like a junkie's longing for her next fix. It is all consuming and mind bending. It takes meaning from my life and refuses to return it. It clouds my mind and leaves me apathetic. 

Sometimes I think it's a literal hunger and I binge. I eat until my tummy groans, obsessing about food, and what I will eat next, though it does me no good. In the past I've sought to leave my head fuzzy with drink. I'm a happy drunk, but in the cold light of morning, with my head pounding, I only feel need more strongly. It is so obvious that drink is just a step towards my grave. A step I should not take often.

And what of love? I have the love of two very dear and beautiful women and several cats. I know it's there, but some days I am just so numb with need that I cannot feel it. Is it that they don't love well? I think not. I think I am more truly loved than most. If I could binge on love the way I binge on food, I would, but that does not seem possible. I've been told I need more attention than any one person could give. Perhaps it's true, but it's also more than two can give, which leaves me certain it is not more love that I need, but something else.

Is it belief that is lacking? Religion perhaps? I was raised without it, but I've spent time taking the Catholic catechism, and spent more than 5 years studying for a pagan priesthood. I know myself inside. I know what drives me in most ways, and I know where my weaknesses are. One thing that studying religion has taught me is that I do not believe in God. I do believe in spirit, but I do not believe it goes on after. In this way I know the nonsense of this need just keeps me from fully immersing myself in the only life I have. It is counter productive. If I could cut it out of me, I would.

Perhaps some other higher cause? I've given of myself in many ways. I will keep doing it, but it drains me rather than curing me. It may be just another expression of my life long depression. So much therapy, so many drugs, and no solutions. I take something now to relieve the anxiety of it, but I've left the depression itself unmedicated for most of a year. On the whole, this makes a better alternative, but it is no cure.

I long for peace. I long for love. I long to be relaxed and unguarded. What keeps me in this bubble of need? How do I escape?"

"event","I've said before that one of the issues I have with blogging is that my partners read it and object to what they see. I've even occasionally told them that if they didn't want problems then they should not read it, but I'm generally a social critter, and bow to the stress of not writing about things that would cause problems. That leaves me with the choice of either not talking or censoring myself, neither of which have been comfortable for me. But I'm a writer, of sorts, and it drives me insane to not write. Oddly writing offline, with no one reading doesn't really do much for me. I've been shifting my life recently, partially to make room for writing, and the peace and lucidity it sometimes brings me.

Life, in general has been good. LWSRN, who asks that I not even write about her, though the ""SRN"" stands for ""Shall Remain Nameless"", has generally been pretty stable, with the exception of the last few days. I'm hoping it's a little speed bump. I've been pretty stable but low key for months now. Somehow treating my anxiety rather than my depression has been a huge win. I wonder why no one thought of it before? It's not that I don't get depressed anymore, I just don't make a big deal of it and it doesn't dominate my life -- and that's pretty important. Kitten's been with us both in a serious  way for months now. Her presence is a huge and loving comfort. She lives about 45 miles from here, but spends three or four nights a week with us now.

LWSRN is off on a business trip at the moment, and I'm lounging at home with Kitten. Normally with weather like this, I'd be out skydiving, which I'll do tomorrow. This morning I played with a book of knots and ran on the treadmill while Kitten slept -- she seems to need quite a bit of sleep. Last night we did regency dancing with her parents. It was a first for me. I'd done folk dancing in college, but nothing quite this formal. There is a big dance tonight, but I don't think we'll be going. I'd thought about doing a party and dinner in the city, but I think we'll likely stay at home and play with those knots a bit."

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are the Haughty Intellectual.&nbsp; You are a very rational person, emphasizing logic over emotion, and you are also rather arrogant and self-aggrandizing.&nbsp; You probably think of yourself as an intellectual, and you would like everyone to know it.&nbsp; Not only that, but you also tend to look down on others, thinking yourself better than them.&nbsp; You could possibly have an unhealthy obsession with yourself as well, thus causing everyone to hate you for being such an elitist twat.&nbsp; On top of all that, you are also introverted and gentle.&nbsp; This means that you are just a quiet thinker who wants fame and recognition, in all likelihood.&nbsp; Rather lacking in emotion, introspective, gentle, and arrogant, you are most certainly a Haughty Intellectual!&nbsp; And, most likely, you will never achieve the recognition or fame you so desire!&nbsp; Sweet!

"event","It's been quiet of late. Things change slowly, I think. We've sort of adopted a fifth cat, if you can believe it. We call her Pumpkin. Right now she haunts the back yard and plays tag with the indoor kitties through the window. LWSRN may have to trap her and get her to the vet so we can make sure she doesn't have feline leukemia or feline AIDS -- both of which could quickly kill the rest of the cats. If she's clean, she'll probably come indoors and live with us for the winter. A thinks she's her cat, perhaps when A runs off to wherever kids go when the set out on their own, she'll take her with her.

Love life has slowly been stabilizing. It's been hard work, but it's been rewarding. Everything's still changing and I have no idea what it will look like when it settles down, but I know it will get there.

Work's been a drag though. They expect me to do paperwork mostly. I'm a manager in everything but title. Feh. On the bright side, they may send me to Israel in January. L's asked me to take her so I can make a vacation of it and she can show me around. I'm thinking about it. I'm also thinking about going to Spain for skydiving in May. First I want to get through the world record next month. I'm not actually on the record attempt -- call me a second string replacement if there's a problem, and with as few first string replacements as they have, that's quite possible. If I don't jump, I'll be post-processing video for them.

My mood's been down. I'm lonely. Been lonely for quite a while. There are holes that will never fill, people who will never be replaced. Life goes on though, and I'm managing the depression better than I ever have before.

First date tonight. A sweet young thing that LWSRN has met. We've talked a tiny bit on line and I'll just have to see what she's like. I have hopes... Hopes are good."

"event","I've been hinting, but I've been trying so hard to keep my mouth shut. I tend to try to keep bad stuff out of my journal because people I am now or have been involved with read it. It kind of defeats the purpose of a journal. For a while I toyed with starting a new one and not telling anyone. That'd solve the wanting to journal thing, but then, writing it all out on my laptop and just leaving it there would too.

Something in me likes an audience. And something in me fears an audience. It's a contradiction, but so am I. So, since I want to write <EM>something</EM>, I'm just going to go with high lights and skip most of the gory details.

N's long gone. I'm sure I've mentioned it somewhere, but I'm not going back and reading. She and I hold my personal record of most breakups. Honestly I'm not sure what happened to the last time around. Not sure what happened to wanting to be friends, but it was painful and I've been hiding myself away. LWSRN, true to the goodness of her heart has remained friends with N. I don't know how often they talk or what is said. LWSRN learned early on that it was far too painful for me to hear&nbsp;and it sent me into a depressing spiral.

A whole portion of my life ceased to exist. A woman I cared dearly about, and a child I loved. Gone. Victims of I don't know what. If I'm honest with myself, I can't say that it's a bad thing that it ended. I believe I'm being honest when I say that it could never work and I was foolish. I am a nice person, and she was not. I'm mostly a lesbian and she's almost completely het. I'm polyamorous, and she is monogamous. Actually she admitted she was not a nice person from the start (a ""bitch"" she said, with seriousness), but I <EM>always</EM> want to give people a chance. I want to believe in them. I believed she was better than that. Perhaps she is now, but the relationship died somewhere in the process.

<EM>I've erased a lot here. Details. Details that don't matter. None of it really matters other than my love of her and the fiery end.

</EM>I tried to go to the venues we shared friends in, but discovered even that was too painful. I gave them up for months, hoping things would heal. They say time heals these wounds, but it's not time, really. It's new people and situations. No one can replace anyone, that hole is always going to be there for me, but at least, I can begin to move on now.

I've been seeing someone new. Call her L2, since I've spoken of an L before. I exchanged a few emails with L2 before N and I broke up. Strange things happened at the time. It's all very confusing, and I won't write down the details as I see them, because it's still a painful mess. I put off meeting L2 for a while, but when hell broke lose I had lunch with her twice, and then we didn't see each other for five weeks.

And then we had lunch again. And then we had dinner with LWSRN, and all three of us ended up in a pile in the bedroom. And then we stopped, because there'd been a communications problem with R, her partner. I had dinner with L2 and R. Then we invited them to <A href=""http://www.sfcitadel.org/"">The Citadel</A>, a bdsm club in San Francisco. No one planned anything, but L2 and I ended up playing while LWSRN and R chatted and watched. And no one had a bad time.

We kept socializing. There was at least one dinner with the four of us. It all felt really nice. Everyone was being happy and easy going and working on communication and keeping it slow when it was needed. (Well, sort of slow.)

This weekend I took L2 and LWSRN to a two day long bdsm party. And we played. And played, and played. Last year we went with N. Many things went wrong, not all of them under control of the three of us, but it was not a good time.

The contrast has been incredible. All of us, except for R. are a bit neurotic by nature and worry about things, but absolutely nothing has gone wrong. It's like it all works. I'm in shock. Sure, there are messed up plans here and there -- we've all done it, but we've all taken it in our stride.

It's all good. Hell, R's even cute, though neither LWSRN nor I have propositioned him or anything. It's like we could all go off and be happy and to hell with the rest of the world. Not that we're at a stage where we're even talking about such things. Right now it's just been getting the safe sex agreements nailed down and ensuring that everyone feels included -- because they are.

Dammit, this is just so good that it's going to kill me if something goes wrong. I may even get my faith back in the poly ideals."

It seems to me that to have fun, you have to honor yourself and your personal limits. That means being strong enough to say ""no"". It also means being strong enough to say ""yes"".

I've lived in fear of other people's opinions all my life. I've done many things because I wanted someone else to approve. It's a sad way to live and I need to stop. That means that some people are going to be disappointed. It's not nice, but it is healthy.

I saw the eye doctor yesterday and this morning. I couldn't see straight. For real. My left eye had been all blurry for days and when I figured out something wasn't quite right, D freaked. Her ex lost an eye because no one paid attention. The eye doctor looked in my eyes and decided that my left optic nerve didn't look quite right. Gods was that nerve wracking. More tests this morning and everything still works the way it should. Calls to my old eye doctor let me know it's always been that way, but shit. Don't scare me like that.

I'm headed for Socal in the morning. Four days of skydiving. One last chance to get on the world record that I'm not going to be on because I damned near killed myself a couple months ago doing this shit. People saw it happen and they expected a body bag, but I walked away. I'm not happy with it. I'm not proud. I did what I planned to do, but someone forgot to tell me to look for one particular thing. But I have to try.

Skydiving and fucked up eyes. This is not a match made in heaven. Thankfully the eyes don't really seem to be a problem.

Still spending too much time alone. Gods it's been a mess. Life changes slowly. Habits change slowly. I'll heal, it'll just take time."

Is it supposed to hurt this bad? Should her very name put me in an emotional spiral that takes me hours or days to surface from? Did I walk away, or just do as she asked, and stay away? It doesn't matter really, she's gone.

I've thought she was gone before. The last time she was careful to explain exactly why it wouldn't work. I nodded and cried. This time was so much different, and seemed so much more final. 

I'm still here. I told her I would be, but I can't stand to watch her live her life without me in it.&nbsp; But I can't stop thinking about her either. So much loss, so much pain."

1) Found a man with a gun hiding in my bedroom closet. I was 9, I think.

2) Flunked out of college and still end up with two degrees with a 4.0 average.

3) Been asked to teach a college course that I needed to take to graduate. I should have taken them up on it -- the guy who taught it sucked.

4) Had sex on the 18th hole of a golf course in the middle of the day. It was raining though.

5) Learned to skydive and had a sometimes lover die diving the day I did my 50th jump. I still skydive.

6) Broke my ankle in three places skydiving. Yes, I still skydive.

7) Blown up nuclear bombs for a living. Okay, I didn't actually push the button, but I had to calibrate the equipment before hand and go into tunnels a mile underground afterwards to retrieve the data tapes.

8) Designed software that's stopped literally millions of spam e-mail.

9) Run the largest BDSM educational organization on the west coast.

10) Lived as both a man and a woman.</P>"

"event","I just got back from <A href=""http://www.floridaskydiving.com/"">Skydiving in Lake Wales</A>. It was a hoot in many ways. Lake Wales was kind of the crossing point for the three hurricanes a couple months ago. The dropzone was leveled. They shredded the hangar and everything else, though there was hardly a dent in their plane. By the time I got there, they'd carted away all the debris and there was little left of the original dropzone other than the foundation. They've set up a number of portable buildings, and seem to be doing just fine though.

I went to Lake Wales for a CRW (Canopy Relative Work) camp in preperation for the women's world record attempt next spring. I don't know that I'll actually make it into the record attempt, but I'm trying. I was the least experienced jumper at the camp, I only had 37 CRW jumps when we started. I hadn't counted my jumps and told them I had 50 when they asked -- they were impressed at how well I did for someone with that few jumps. Little did they know.

I did 12 jumps over the course of the weekend. The smallest was 6 people and the largest was 14, I docked no earlier than fourth and no later than ninth. I got in on every single formation -- it's so easy to fall behind on one of these jumps. I'm revved. Now all I have to do is lose 20 lbs in the next 4 months -- my canopy is a bit overloaded."

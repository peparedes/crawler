"event","hello again... its your subconscious mind... ive decided to drop in on you again!  ah... young love... its the sickening slime that i see right here in front of me.  its the demonic possession of one's soul that seems to be what everyone is...or isnt... searching for.  well... let me see... the girls look for a guy to hold them, trust them, love them... but she is almost too willing to let him down and beat him to a insignificant pulp...with only a few words.  he, on the other hand... the boy is almost NEVER searching for someone to love... unless love is defined as the very quick procession from first base to a home run... just to use a mortal cliche.  Yes... a first kiss and first touch are sacred... but to the male species... it is nothing more than a trophy to showcase to thier friends.
now... if you are one of the few lucky ones... you may someday stumble into one of those girls or guys that happen to have something in common with you.  like a couple who just so happens to be within cross bow range... she is desperately in love with him.  he is desperately in love with her... they are so intertwined... that is nearly impossible to distinguish each individual entity.  so alike is this couple... that its almost to the point of incest... that rabid form of unleashing pleasure... much to the disgust of everyone within close range.
now my dear friend... i will tell you one small piece of advice... watch who you love and love noone... but remember... i am only a figment of elementary particles... smile and dream my dear.

its is me, your local lack of person, i just bring news of life to you. but you must remember, dear friend, i am but a figment of your imagination.  yet, i will describe myself to you.
eyes that pierce the souls of others, but can turn inward at thier own soul, therefore, all examination becomes comparitive. hands that can mold, break, or twist your perspective to a broadened outlook. a mouth that whispers truth, screams justice, and sings life... or death for that matter.  a body that moves between heaven and hell, yet with grace, agility, and the rare gift of invisibility.  you cant see me, but i see you... actually, you see me, but you DONT see me.  
nice to meet you dearest, until next time as mortals say.

"event","this is life... its only a little glimpse at the heaven or hell of our eternity.  now... the question really is whether or not you choose to go to heaven or that lovely little pit of ash and ice.  well...lets see... i can look around and see that the guy to my right may or may not be going to heaven... a little scrawny, bit nerdy, but overall a nice guy.  and the guy to my left could or could not be going to hell... adorable, curser, but overall hes just who he is, a person.  oh dear god... a person? a real human being? someone who wears no mask? is it possible... i regret to inform my dear friend... but it isnt.  i could smile at you and wish you were dead... i could cry with you and be laughing at your pain... welcome to the matrix my darling... nothing is what it seems. i am no philosopher... and i am no super-genius... im only noone and im only telling you the truth.
my greetings and best wishes of the best of luck for you...

"event","<font size=""1"">i stole my friend's digital camera. 

not on purpose...i borrowed it, honestly believing i'd be able to return it. 

i moved to mobile, and he moved to eugene. 

if i've ever had the money, i never remembered to mail it. 

if i've ever remembered to mail it, i've never had the money. 

and now, i'm tense about speaking to him (who i've known for nearly a decade) because i think he'll bring up his camera...which i've accidentally kept for almost 2 years now. 

i suck. 

i hope he forgives me. 
and yes, it actually matters."

"event","<font size=""1"">i am obsessive compulsive. 

ex: if i touch something with on hand/finger/foot/etc., i have to equally touch it all over again, twice, with BOTH hands/all fingers/etc. starting either left hand to right hand, or thumbs outwards towards pinkies. 

ex: i'm afraid of germs. even my own. i won't touch my face (or let anyone or anything) touch my face because i can still 'feel' the dirtiness afterwards. i can only touch my own face after i've washed my hands, and yes i'm adamant about antibacterial soap.

ex: it woes me that i have not yet found an antibacterial laundry detergent. 

ex: i have a routine that i've had since childhood of how i shower, and if it's not followed, i don't feel clean. and shower again. 

ex: i think i'm wearing away the countertops at work from cleaning them. i can't stand for a speck of coffee grounds to be there, a drop of milk, or even water spots from where i've wiped. 

ex: sometimes, i have to do the 'even touching' thing with my hands, wherever i'm at and whatever i'm doing, just to feel 'right'.

these are just some examples. really, you don't want to be around me when i'm cleaning the apartment. 

but...
i'm better at controlling it than when i was younger. it doesn't actually affect my life. when i'm stressed, it's worse. i've found that when i'm in a good mood, it's nearly nonexistant. i don't think it's severe enough that i need medication. 

and when it's completely overthrown is when i'm being creative. when i'm writing or painting or building something, it's out the window. i'm messy and wild and stuff is everywhere. 
my apartment is immaculate, except for what i call my 'chaos corner'...where my desk, computer (and random computer parts), easel, and large wooden chest of art supplies is located. it looks like something exploded, but that's the only way i can create."

not violence on others -- violence on walls, doors, pillows, my car, myself...
i have three bruised knuckles and possibly a broken finger from last night.

it's only because when i try to talk, no one listens. 
at least not him."

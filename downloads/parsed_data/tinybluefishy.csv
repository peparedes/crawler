"event","So the ex-boy called me on the weekend, he'd been dumped by the girl that he got with 5 days after being with me, and we talked, at first I found it amusing and then I wanted to kick his ass I did not need this my life was heading down a good direction and then he comes back in a fiddles with it. Its almost like he can sense when I'm just about to truly let go and then he swoops in grabs me again hangs on for a day or two and then leaves again.

And I'm done with feeling this way he basically told me that the other guy who was interested in me at the same time as him wanted my number and he told him that we don't really talk anymore and didn't give him my number this was when he had a girlfriend. I don't get it, does he just love the power trip that keeps me holding on, because really I getting sick of it. I don't want a boyfriend right now there are so many other things that I still need to sort out in my life that a boyfriend would just complicate but I need the boy to either be there or let me go because this to-ing and fro-ing is not working for me, I'm not equipped to deal with it at the moment."

The coughing, the nose thing and the feeling that my sinus is about to explode when I lean forwards are all things I needed right now. Oh well, medication, chicken soup and sleep will hopefully help me.

I have been catching up on Doctor Who though, I am in love with eleven and AMY! its brilliant, its not the shipping because now I feeling like they are more the greatest best friends ever than anything else, but they are still epic and awesome!

Loved the Glee Rocky Horror Ep it was really quite good, I loved how nearly everyone got solos and loved just the general feel of the ep it was a great way to pay homage to Rocky Horror.

Another Brilliant ep of Offspring this week, I am so in love with this show, basically everything about it is excellent and wonderfully realistic.

"event","How is life? it always feels like forever since I've posted here probably because its true, I suck at LJ most of the time which is not great but it is what it is for now I guess.

So a brief update on the life of me :

1. I'm going to Montreal next monday for basically a week and I'm really excited I've never been to the East Side of Canada in the nearly 3 years I've lived here so I'm hitting it up during the Comedy Festival which will be awesome I'm really Excited! I might be going to seen Rove and Tim Minchen while I'm there tres awesome!

2.  I have recently become OBSESSED with the West Wing I have watched 3 1/2 season in the past 2 week while working 12 hours days at horse shows and being plain exhausted yep it sucked me in why did no one tell me this show was this good??

3. I'm going home in a little over 2 months with a stop over in NYC and LA with my BFF who is flying out from Oz to come home with me (part of me thinks it just to make sure I actually come home lol) I'm not sure how long I'm going to be home for yet but at least till christmas seems to be the plan now I'm really excited!

"event","Update Time!

1. I started watching the new series of Doctor Who, I'm in love with Matt Smith as the Doctor and Amy Pond is perhaps the best companion yet, and yes I do ship Amy/11 who wouldn't?
 
2. Watched Zombieland the other day have a newer greater appreciation for Emma Stone not only is she gorgeous and funny but the girl can act too, love her!

3. Finally caught up on Glee, I love the last two episodes, the song choices were amazing though I'm pretty sure we all guess the Jesse storyline but it was awesome none the less, I also love that it is not just Rachel and Finn doing all the songs, i think everyone on of the core 6 got a song/storyline about them in these 2 eps which was really great to see it's a way to always keep the stories fresh.

Thats about it fandomish wise what new with everyone out there?"

Back in Calgary after 3 months in Florida and a 3 day horse trailer trip across America. I had a wicked time but I'm glad to be back amongst the land of internet and LJ, and have been catching up with everyone, though I may suck a little at commenting I'm getting there.

The highlight of my trip include seeing Taylor Swift's Fearless tour in Sunrise, F, driving across almost every state in the South-East USA (florida, Georgia, tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana and then ALBERTA!) I was really fun but long and tiring.

"event","So wow its been a long time since I updated, but I have reasons there just not very good ones. 

First I am LAME this is undeniable now wow I suck. Two, we were showing at an indoor tournement which meant starting at 6am(or earlier) and then not finishing till 10pm or so, what fun. And thirdly because I was so run down on the 14 days in a row of afformented hours I then caught the flu which made me want to die, so I just took cold and flu medication and pass out instead, same difference.  

So I am back and will hopefully be spamming with a pretty picture like update on my life and a talky pictury chat about my two favourite new shows, Glee (dah!) and Legend of the Seeker (btw why did I not know about this show earlier, it is very pretty!)

As watched the new Star Trek Movie the other day, I really loved it, and I have never watch Star Trek before and still don't know if I will but I like J.J. Abrams version though I would probably watch that man version of a shoe  I love him!"

<lj-cut text=""Why this show<everything else - (contain spoilers for 1.04)"">

First of all Kurt dancing to single ladies with Tina and Cheerleader girl (blanking on her name) I had already seen it and it still ruled Kurt = love. Then the football excuse to his Dad was pretty awesome and<i> I'm Kurt Hummel and I'm here to audition for the role of Kicker</i> and his first Single Ladies reprise had me in stitches. Love Him!

And then Coach Sue and Sandy I was wondering when these two would team up evil yet effective and Sue's Corner is just hilarious.

Ok Rachel, I get you're the best, and  I love your for it but it's called Glee Club not Rachel's Club of Her Shear Awesomeness so share with the other children. I like the fact that in the end Will called on Tina to do the solo because she has a wicked voice and it deserves to be on show to. And Rachel will be back we all know that, she just needs to pull her head out of her butt a little bit. But she is still my favorite Glee member so its all ok.

The Finn, Quinn and Puck love triangle yeah kinda called it last week but it's still awesome to watch it play out and the fact that Quinn convinced Finn that she was pregnant from the hot tub well it's just mental but the saddest thing about that is that because of the lack of sex education in schools some kids really do believe that which is truly sad. Another note every week I seem to fall more and more into like with Puck, I think I may end up loving the guy who knows.

Will's wife and her sister bore me although her sitting in Quinn's car may have been her second best scene after her opening rant about being on her feet 4 hours a day, it was worth it for the lols.

The footballers dancing was pretty much amazing love every minute of it, I hope one of the boys that joined glee was 34 because kid could bust a move.

Finally Kurt's coming out scene with his dad may have been one of the best ever, because the kid flames so bright you can see him from space and his dad knew and was ok with it oh so much love for both Kurt and his dad. The best moment for the Dad was the cheering at the Football game and <i> I've know since you were three, all you want for your birthday was a pair of sensible heels</i> and the fact that he loves him the same, oh also when he asked if he was sure, loved it!

Best Episode yet!

"event","<lj user=""cecism"">  gave me  <strong>Canada, Prison Break, Spicks and Specks, Robert Harvey, Victoria</strong>.

<strong>Canada</strong> - My Adopted home moved here for a winter Ski Hill Season about 18 months ago, Loved the country hated the job so switched jobs but stayed in Canada. I love Snow and all the awesomeness that is winter, I feel that Australia is kinda deprived not having a &lt;i>real&lt;/i> winter

<strong> Prison Break</strong> - one of my Favorite TV shows ever, I just love it! Michael and Sara rock my socks, Linc's inability to do up buttons, Sucre's awesomeness and T-Bag's creepiness great great show! Although sometimes it does try and break my heart.

<strong>Spicks and Specks</strong> - This actually is my favorite show, I randomly stumbled on it one night of tv flicking and became addicted and then proceed to infect my entire family and friends. I then discover by happy accident that I know the Production Coordinator who could get us tickets and take us backstage (something I feel very blessed about). I love Adam Hill's humour except when my sister did me in for being from out of the country and he tries to figure out a joke about being a horse groom but he couldn't think of one.

<strong>Robert Harvey</strong> - A Bloody legend! Like seriously I love the man, give him a medal (a premiership one, I wish). An AFL player back from the golden days of the VFL up until 2008, he played the game with dignity and loyalty sticking with the club through god times and back gotta love him!

<strong>Victoria</strong> My home state, I love nearly everything about it, the beaches, the weather, the sports man nature of the place. It's just home to me and I can't escape from loving it."

<b> 19 </b> <i> Adele</i>
I love this album, Adele voice is so rich and wonderfully soulful. The songs she writes are one that really speak to me and I love it.

<b> Narrow Stairs </b> <i> Death Cab for Cutie</i>
Not their best release but I really love the vibe of this album, its kind of melancholy sound and moodiness sit well with me. 

<b> Chimney's Affire </b> <i> Josh Pyke</i>
The one Australian Album that I have bought I love Josh's voice and the mellow way that that this album is It makes me smile and remind me of long drives in the country for some reason, its just great. The kind of album that feels like you have know it forever after just one listen.

Thats about its for Albums simply because I don't have that many, and 2008 has been about me discovering bands that everyone else already knew about such as Stabilo, Modest Mouse, Sublime, M.I.A. and many many others."

I finished working my ski season at Lake Louise about a month ago but before that I lined up my next job working as a groom for a show-jumping barn based out of Calgary and three days after I started working for them we left for San Diego or more specifically Del Mar where we were for a 3 week long show tour before returning to Canada for another three weeks here in Langley before heading home to Calgary for a 4-5 show period at Spruce Meadows.

I working really long hours and the job is quite demanding but as of right now I have never loved a job so much its fun but hard and the horses are all really great and the other grooms I work with plus  the family I work for a really nice! So I'm in a happy place!

1. Reply to this post, and I will pick five of your icons.
2. Make a post (including the meme info) and talk about the icons I chose.
3. Other people can then comment to you and make their own posts.

here are the five she chose for me, and she picked most of my favourites too!

I love this icon, it shows the skins kids (and my newest addiction) having fun and just being teenagers and having a good time despite all the shittiness and craziness that goes on in their lives. Also the colours are awesome

Gilmore Girls, how much I loved/love that show, it had the best mother/daughter dynamic that I have seen written, and also the best writing and one liners. Like this one.

Harry Potter, I love the colouring of this icon, the mix of black and white and colour, and also the prettiness of Dan's face and power of this scene in the movie. 

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tinybluefishy/pic/00004a0c/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/tinybluefishy/pic/00004a0c"" width=""100"" height=""100"" border='0'/></a>

Serena/Dan, the most normal relationship on Gossip Girl and two beautiful people make one hell of an icon.

Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time, I studied it in year 12 and fell complete in love with it. But this movie adaptation, the first time I saw it I hated it, seriously! But it grew on me after a second viewing and I discovered the beauty in the cinematography and in Kiera and I love this icon."

"event","Hey do you know whats better than the temperature being below -35C, when its below -35C and there is no hot water! Because let me tell you doing the 10 second cold shower scrub is so much fun when its that freaking cold outside!

Whats happened is that the instant water heater has broken a something-something and that old leaves the 3 storage heaters to heat up enough water for 230+ people to shower in, yeah that doesn't work! So this morning I had a definately cold shower to follow the past two days of mildly warm showers.

Whats worse in that I work in the housing department and therefore I'm hearing the complaints that everyone has even though we call the repairman the first day it happened and the only problem with getting the hot water fixed is that we live in the middle of freaking nowhere and its -35C outside!

Also today was busier than normal around housing as it was too cold to run 7/9 or so lifts at the hill so about 70% of the staff were sent home early a trend that might continue tomorrow because the forecast is a toasty -25C  and thats the high!

Yay I love winter!"

Not only did I receive a package from home containing crispy m&m's, vegemite, milo, tim tams and natural confectionary snakes, along with christmas presents (pre-wrapped by my mother to drive me insane with curiousity).  But also today a group of us headed out skating on Lake Louise, despite the fact that it was like -9 celius or something like that.

It's been awhile, I've been super busy cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning! 

What fun!

Life is pretty good at the moment, settled in pretty well to my new life and all the stuff I have to do. The ski hill that I work at opens up this weekend so I will start snowboarding (otherwise know as butt contact with the snow) from this weekend onwards. Wish me luck!

I now have access to wireless on my laptop so I will post some piccies of this gorgeous place for you all soon, but until then take my word for it! lol!

I have been here for over a week, and the thing that I am gladest for is that I scored a single room, seriously I don't share all that well with others if they are constantly in my personal space. Though I really get on with my unit mates, so far we have a Canadian and 2 other Aussies, and I know at least one of the others is also an Australian, but there arre still to more on top of that to come. I will be living with 7 people, in a tiny unit, but so far we all get along great so no issues.

I went to Banff during the week which is this really touristy town about 40 minutes from Lake Louise, it was good I got some shopping in, finally brought a winter coat because it get down to minus 30 here apparently (YAY!). I will post pictures when I get internet access on my laptop  which we are still trying to figure out but I know that there will be wireless internet here in about 2 week or so, which will be awesome!

The weather is still pretty nice in the low teens or high single digits. But one of the things I am loving the most is the instant tv shows, no more downloading! I watched the Office, Prison Break (we're nearly broken up:() and FNL which are all kinds of awesome!

thats all for now gotta go"

just a quick little note to let you know that I have arrived safe in Lake Louise and have made it to Charleston Residence, and have set up my room and everything.

I'm not quite 100% sure on what internet access I'll have here, currently using a pay per use computer @ $@ for 15 min so probably won't use this one much.

everything seems to be going ok, will either start work tomorrow or saturday, not sure yet!

<b>adam hills </b> This man is hilarious and sooo cute! I have met him on several occassions and he is just a lovely funny person and is definately an interest!

<b>jim halpert</b> Seriously how can you not love him he is such a beautiful funny, sensitive wonderful character (played by the extremely handsome John Krasiniski) and one half of my favourite couple. I just love him!

<b>jonas armstrong </b> Plays Robin in Robin Hood and is just a spunky cute skinny lad!

<b>michael/sara </b> They were once my Complete Fandoms OTP, but then we all know what might have happened but yeah they are just a beautiful couple, with a great journey behind them and a great journey ahead of them and such a story to tell

<b>pride and prejudice </b> A book that I first read in year 12 english lit (cos I am a book nerd!) and feel completely in love with it and since the I have basically inhaled all different aspects of the story and love seeing other people intereptation of the story in movie or telemovie form. Its just an obession of mine

<b>travel </b> I love travel, and this is magnified by the fact that I'm moving to Canada on Tuesday but I just love getting out there and exploring other places and other lifestyles, its a passion of mine

"event","- The Office - I have nearly finished the 2nd Disc of Season 3 of the Office (meaning just finished A Benihana Christmas) and I have mixed feelings about Karen, I like her as a character but she is simply the stopper in the Jim/Pam relationship and the speech that JIm give to Michael at the end of A Benihana Christmas about rebounds seriously that is where he's at he's with a rebound, and by the look on his face he's aware of it at least to some extent. Also how at first he denies Pam's present and then at the end accepts it and the prank they play, it just made love them more!

- Prison Break, still haven't watched 3x01 and my season 2 DVD's are next up on my DVD player after I have finished the Office

- Work, I am so sick of working, I have worked over 140 hours in the last 3 weeks and I'm just done!

I'm going to see Superbad tonight so hopefully that will put me in a better mood!"

I must finish watching the Office and then S2 of PB before next Wednesday, (as I have no idea how to download shows *hides computer illiteracy*) so I am watching with Australia next week, (unless of course some wants to tell me how)! and must stop reading the spoilers, or reviews as I've been so good up till now!"

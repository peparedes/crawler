What the hell did I do wrong?

Why do you avoid me Malik?

I feel so alone. For once more in my life I am alone. I havent even seen him for so long. He must hate me. Or has grown tired of me and found someone else...*shrugs* I dont know... I dont know what to think...If he doesnt come back to me soon...then... then... I'll know for sure that he doesnt want me anymore. 

And I love him. He does things and goes off... and doesn even want to let me in on it. Am I too clingy? Am I smothering him?

I'm sorry if I am Malik...

Please... don't leave me."

Heh! Oisis smiles upon you gracefully. You know who you are...*grins*

In other news. Malik and I are back at boinking again. Oh sweet lovin' I'm still iffy about all this foreplay buisness. I like to have it when I want and how I want...

According to Kitty, it was Irvin's birthday the other day. And what does that cheeky sex fiend lover of mine do... MELTED MY ICEYPOLE!!!! Gah! Hot day and it has to melt in my hand at seeing him nude and his legs wide open. RA damnit he's such a cock tease. *drools at the thought* He is such a sex god.

And screams like a banshee. 

And swears like a trojan.

Has the tightest arse.

Most tastiest cock.

suckable pecks.

kissable lips.

...

...

*drool* RA DAMNIT I'm horney again and Malik isnt about..>,< Neither is Seth. I NEED MY COCK RA DAMNIT!

Also... We has our Nipple pieced now! XD. Might have hurt like a bitch but it was worth it when Ryou looked in the mirror. Kakaakaka... Oh sweet Isis- 

*Comfortably on the bed flicking through Ryou's homework trying to make heads and tails of it all. *

Ryou: OMG... YAMIIIIIIIIiiiiii...

*Innocence* What IS it Ryou-poo?

Ryou: *runs in from the bathroom shirt off and indicating to the nipple piercing* WHAT DA HELL IS THIS?

Hmmm... looks like a nipple stud to me. *snerk*

Ryou: B-But what... WHATS IT DOING ON ME?

I dunno... maybe you did it in yer sleep... *would be laughing my arse off if it wasnt for the fact that I enjoy tormenting him mentally.*

Ryou: YOU did this... well I'm taking it out.

Oh no you dont..*moves over backing Ryou up against the wall* Not in this life, the after life or the next...l you want me to quit smoking... you'll let me pirece our bodies. Which is it to be Hikari?

Ryou: *has this unberably cute pout on his face and when i do mean cute.. I mean to the point where only I can withstand such an attack.* B-But yaaaami... I dont like it... and it hurts.

*smiles somewhat.* Not to worry... the swelling shall go down in a few days and besides.. we look sexy. *Licks up the shell of his ear*

(Now let me note that this does not nessecarily mean I fuck myself. As Ryou and I are two totally different personalities, and in any case... being my bitch I can fuck him when ever I want. Doesnt nessesarily mean I love him like I love my MALIK~ You shall always be my bitch and you know it)

Ryou: Yami... what am i to do with you...?

Let me get a tongue piercing...

Ok and the rest of that was pretty much running all over the house out the yard down the street through the market past two chicks making out in a phone box over Alaska and then back in the house of some bonus sucking up sex. *snerk* You should see that boy run...especially when weilding a crow bar and a rubber chicken

PH34R RYOU'S RUBBER CHICKEN!!!!

That is all."

I did something so insensitive to my darling Marik. Something thats taken me a while even now to forgive myself for.

I was so caught up in my own needs that I didn't even think about his. All I wanted was sex. All I wanted was to have fun and fuck the brains out of somebody. And thats all I did for the last few days at that. I may have been thinking about him, but deep down... maybe I was just too selfish to care. And for that I am so sorry...

Yes, we screamed and yelled at each other.. or more I did the screaming and destruction. And then we cried... I cried, I actually cried. I dont cry. But I did. 

And then came the best part about fighting with the one you love. 

I'm just happy that everything is fine between us now. I didn't mean to hurt him, my Marik. 

I've decided.. that just for a while.. I'll lay off the intimacy with Seth a bit... excluding handjobs and blowies. But it's the real intimacy I mean... that stuff that bonds us together... I figured I was getting too attached to Seth and kinda made me mad at myself for doing what I did to him.

I'm just glad he is the only one who has seen me cry.

And I am sorry too Seth, it's nothing against you. Nothing what so ever... I did something wrong and was kicked for it so to speak. Am making up for it however..."

Too hot to do ANYTHING... Well, ALMOST!!

The 2 Hikari's were off at school and had left us home today. How could they? Something about Yamis disturbing they forces of their concentrationl.. that and there was a test to take. <,< I could answered all the questions and gotten out early. BWAAhahahaah. Then he said I'm not smart enough for this Era. Like WDF? Well if I just had a look at some of those books I still coulda done it cause I have excelent memory and problem solving skills. You get that from living in the streets of Ciro with getting away without being caught by Pharoh's guards.

Ever seen someone chase you and fall flat on their face in horse shit?

Well anyway, It was hot, it was boring... Malik and I just doing NOTHING... Till he suggested we go swimming, I agreed but then he just changes his mind and hints to some more frisky stuff. I''m like... Ra damnit make up ya bloody mind. I said I'd crack eggs over his head if he wanted to get wet and the fool took it seriously and went on about how I don't love him no more.

Idiot. Ofcourse I love him. How could I not.

Eventually I caved and went over and started feeling Malik up. Wasn't complaining now was he...?

So the rest of the afternoon was spent in making out and other sweet and naughty things. 

I love my BronzeGod and always will!"

Misty: *glares back* You only needed to ask.

Oh yeah! I know what that means... I ask and you say 5 more mins. 2 FUCKING HRS LATER~

Misty: That was NOT my FAULT! Computer suddenly decided it wanted to do a virus check.

Hn, whatever. Well I'm using Misty's PC cause Ryou is getting the new one hooked up and all. So be glad once all that bullshit is done. I don't understand these things at all. I swear this Era should have come with a mannual. I've been jipped.

Marik was over last night, him and Bakura had to do some school work assignment. Meanwhile... yours truely and Mmmmm-alik have some good quality time... right infront of them. XD Must have been told off about 5 or 6 times to take it else where's. The Hikari's COULD have joined in... Malik and myself just love to dominate the Hikari's. But NOOOOoooo... Ryou went into a full on rant about school ethics and the fact that if they did indeed fail because of us, we'd be confined. As in confined to our Items and not allowed out till said so.

Lil shit.

Meh~ the couch started gettingg uncomfortable anyway and so we continued upstairs.

After.. 'play time' Malik offers me this stick. XD For once I'm not being perverted. It was small and white with a yellowish tip on the end. He said that these are what mortals smoke. I remeber smokeing, only in Egypt we smoked from jars or canisters. I'd only done it once... when I was a kid. Some noble payed me to give him sex and after he offered me this tube which he'd stuck in his mouth and breathed in it's contents and blew out smoke. I must have hacked the shit out of my lungs for hrs after that and the arsehole thought it was some big joke. 

But even when Malik offered me these 'ciggeretts' as Mortals call them, it still took me time to adjust and only hacked my lungs out for a few mins. or so. It's only the fact that it's been thousands of yrs since I've done it. 

Mortals come out with the weirdest shit. We must have smoked about half the packet between the two of us. In between ravishing each other in the process... I don't think I could get enough of his tight hot ass.

Marik and Malik had left after the study group down stairs had finished and Ryou came upstairs to put away his books and to have a shower. He walks in and see's me laying on his bed looking as smug as ever. He winkles his nose and gives me this weird highly suspeicous look. 

'Did you burn something?'

'No.'

'Well why does it smell like-... you've been smoking haven't you.'

'Maybe... maybe not.'

'You know that stuff is bad for your health.' He then goes to his closet to take out those pansey girl jammies with the yellow sunflowers.

'Ryou... reality check, I - AM - DEAD!!!'

Heh! Jar-red.

'No don't put those on...' Those Ra-damned PJ's

'Why not?'

*smirks* 'Cause... I want to have my Wicked Way with you...'

I dunno why he even bothers wearing clothes to bed... they come off anyway! XD
Mmm... Hikari is so warm. But I hate it when he twists and turns in the night and jabs his boney hips into me. >< I think it's time he ate more...

My Yami is asleep, seems that he did eventurally carry out his threat of spanking my arse and then taking me up against the very desk I sit at now. More like half sitting half standing, a little too rough for my liking if you ask me. And then there are times that he takes his time and I don't mind that, i don't mind the occasional rough fuck too...

He said to me something like he would pay good money to watch me fuck Yugi up against the school lockers infront of everybody. I said he had to be out of his 'RA-DAMNED' mind and that it just WASN'T going to even HAPPEN. And besides, how can I be sure that Yugi is into it like we are? I don't know what him and his Yami get up to, but Bakura seems to think that it's not quite purely platonic after all.

I know Bakura doesn't like the Pharoh much, something about their past. But he still goes on about how he shall pay with a good rough fucking and see how HE likes to be made a slave.

If he's not careful, he could expose us both or get himself into alot of trouble.

I have 3 assignments due in tomorrow and my Yami insists on bed play. Not tonight I'm affraid, I want to get these assignments FINISHED!!! THEN he can...have his 'Wicked way' with me. 

Please, just sleep long enough for me to finish my work!

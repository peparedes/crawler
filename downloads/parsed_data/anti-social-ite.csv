It's how she ends up as the Chief of Staff to the First Lady, the way she realises how amazing she is, the confidence she gains. It's how normal she is, how she has her little quirks and the way she makes so many mistakes. It's the way she gets into a fight with a guy in a chicken suit. It's her love for the ordinary people (<em>&quot;Cathy needed to take a second job so her dad could be covered by insurance. She tried to tell you how bad things were for family farmers; you told her we already lost Indiana.&quot;</em>), and it's the way she is the ordinary people.

"event","So I just finished the latest Bones, and I felt like doing a bit of a rant about Booth and his season 5/6 characterisation. As per usual, would love to hear your thoughts. Spoilers up to 6x13 under the cut.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">Something that has grated on me about Booth that really stood out last night: the way he sets the standards and you either conform to them or you don't. I mean, the clearest example from the last episode, was the way he told Brennan she could either stay and not get emotionally involved, or go and their partnership would be severed forever. I understand that he was drunk and upset and all that, but it just seemed like he just keeps delivering all these ultimatums to the women in his life.<br /> <br />Rebecca, we don't really know that much about, but Brennan? When he told her he loved her - which I thought was super sweet at the time, and still do - it was a forever type of love. She couldn't do that - she couldn't see that far in the future, but you know, she loved him at that moment. It was just that she didn't know if she still would 30 years from then. And he couldn't deal with that. To him, it was either she loved him, or she didn't. End of story. <br /><br />Hannah - she wanted to be with him. She loved him - she said she loved him, and whatever you feel about Hannah, I'm pretty sure  you can see that. But she didn't want to get married - she's always said she didn't want to get married, but she loved what she had with him, and even after his proposal she was still willing to go back to that. Na&iuml;ve as that must seem, she never once lied to him, and never once led him on. But Booth, obviously wanting to prove his love for her, had to propose. And the fact that she couldn't conform to his standards - he couldn't take that either.<br /> <br />I'm not saying that Booth should have just sucked it up, and carried on with their relationship. He's the marrying kind, we know that. But he also knew she wasn't. And the fact he carried on the relationship, despite knowing this, despite knowing that his endgame was marriage just makes it seem like he was hoping to change her mind. Like he was expecting to. <br /><br />And that speech he gave about being pissed that women didn't want what he had to offer - that really annoyed me too. I mean, I'm trying to make some concessions for his state of inebriation and the fact that he'd just been dumped, but it did not sit well with me at all. There are heaps of women out there who want what you have to offer, Booth - you just need to go out and find them, instead of trying to force 'what you have to offer' on women who clearly don't. I have to say, I was half-hoping that Brennan would choose to leave instead of staying. Maybe I just don't have enough empathy for people in pain. <br /><br />Anyway, those were my thoughts, and I'm not sure how much of Booth's characterisation is due to the writers' and their dodgy plotting, but I guess, as a viewer, there's not that much difference. How Booth acts onscreen when he's pissing me off is as much a part of his character as how he acts when he's being all lovely and sweet and there for Brennan. So, I'm just going to sit here and reserve judgement on the writers until I see how this all plays out. <br /><br />So. Thoughts? <br /><br />(Sidenote: Hodgins and Angela continue to be tres adorable.)</lj-cut><br /><br />Off to watch the latest Community now. Real life post to come eventually. :) Also, I&nbsp;feel like I need a new, more appropriate mood theme."

"event","So, like every other sane person out there, I've been watching <em>Fringe,</em> and I think the latest episode has sparked a fair bit of discussion, and while I do have theories and all that, <lj user=""flatlined""/>&nbsp; just linked me to a <a href=""http://hopesichord.tumblr.com/post/3127127263/so-i-keep-seeing-that-fringe-post-being-reblogged-and"">post </a>on Peter's role in the most recent season, and I&nbsp;had <em>thoughts. </em>And they're going to go under a cut to save your flists. Probably also going to be crossposted around, because I'd love to hear other people's thoughts. Even if you disagree vehemently with me. I&nbsp;do draw the line at getting into fistfights about this though. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">Regarding Peter being Olivia's emotional anchor, well, it makes sense to me? After all she's been through in the past season - realising that she's been experimented on, having lost John, and Charlie, realising she has these amazing powers, realising that she has some semblance of feelings for Peter and forming this family unit with Walter, Peter, and to some extent, the grossly underused Astrid, it makes sense that she'd have some attachment to all of them. <br /><br />And considering she had just lost Peter from her family unit because of the revelation that Walter had stolen him from Over There and him feeling, I don't know, betrayed and cheated, well, I don't think Olivia can take anymore loss. And so she goes Over There to find him, to save him from Walternate and the machine, and she tells him that he belongs with her. Not that she loves him and needs him and anything like that - those reasons may be there, and yeah, they were mentioned, but really, they don't really count. He belongs with her. So I think, it's the culmination of all these feelings of loss and that wanting of that sense of belonging that draws Peter from her subconscious into a psychological manifestation. And personally, I do think she's a bit in love with him, but putting shipper goggles aside, that's how I reason his presence there. <br /><br />And Peter has been there for her, you know, in the entirety of the show's run. Less so at the start because she had just met him, and yes, she had Charlie who was her best friend, and I'm not trying to cheapen Charlie's worth and value to Olivia, because I am really looking forward to Alt!Charlie's interactions with Olivia being Olivia not Alt!Liv. (Plus I just love Charlie. And Lincoln.) But after all these weird Fringe events started happening around her, after she loses Charlie, Peter is there. Peter comes back in Ability when she has to save the city by turning off a set of lights with her mind. Peter is there in Jacksonville when she has to access these hidden parts of her brain that she never even knew existed to identify the building that's going to disappear. He's there for her, and in this - this weirdest Fringe event that she's ever experience - this being trapped in a parallel universe, I think it makes sense that she needs him to be there for her again. <br /><br />So she needs Peter, both to anchor her - because, really, the poor girl has lost everyone else that is aware of these screwed up things in her screwed up life - and because she needs her family unit back. And then she gets back to Over Here, and realises that they didn't need her. They didn't realise she was replaced, they didn't realise that Alt!Livia wasn't her. And she loses them all over again. <br /><br />That's what I think is what part of happening in Olivia's mind right now and why she's so insecure and why she keeps bringing up Alt!Livia. Also, like most people, I do think that she still has bits of Alt!Liv stuck in her brain, because think of how long it took her to get rid of John from her mind, and they only shared memories. Olivia and Alt!Liv were the same person. So I do think - hope - that that's going to come back, along with that scene in the hospital where she's sneaking drugs.<br /><br />To be honest though, I think that, if anyone, it should have been Ella and Rachel that anchored her, and I loved that it was them - Ella's birthday - that helped her cement in her head, that she wasn't who they were telling her she was. But I also get why they weren't part of her hallucination, her psychological manifestation of her suppressed self. Because she needed to hear from someone who understood the whole Fringe division thing, a Yoda-like figure, if you will, that she could trust to tell her why this wasn&rsquo;t right. Why she wasn't right.<br /><br />And it couldn't be anyone who had a double Over There either, because that would mean she could attribute it to, I don't know, her being tired and projecting her recent supposed psychological breakdown onto them. So from a selection list of everyone in the Fringe division, it was just pretty much whittled down to Peter. <br /><br />While I do agree that John and Charlie should have played a larger role in helping Olivia to realise who she is etc, I don't think there was much point in them showing up to be her emotional anchor. Mostly because, well, they're both dead. There's not much to cling onto if she's going to wake and realise they're gone. Because she might as well stay being Alt!Liv, because in that universe, at least Charlie is alive. And John might have a chance at being alive too. <br /></lj-cut>"

"event","I&nbsp;never got to finish my 30 days of awesome female characters meme, mostly because I am <em>lazy</em>, but the other half of my list are still pretty damn awesome women, so I figured I should just finish it now anyway. <br /><strong><br />17. Britta Perry</strong> <em>(Community)</em><br /><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" style=""width: 456px; height: 256px;"" src=""http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_la98ydEK111qcnc55o1_500.png"" /></div><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">The most awesome thing about Britta Perry, you will notice from the photo, is her costume choices. Last year, she was a giant squirrel and this year, she was a T-Rex. Both of which, are totally bad-ass, especially if you, as she is, are sick of girls using Halloween as an excuse to dress up as sluts. I blame Mean Girls for that misconception. ;)&nbsp;That aside,&nbsp;I think what makes Britta an amazing female character - an amazing character at that - is how she embodies so many of us. She's trying to do the right thing - she knows what is right - truth, feminism, social rights - and the type of person she wants to be. But quite often, she fails. Most notably, I&nbsp;think, is that episode in the first season, where she tells Annie and Shirley about the silencing of journalists and then gets mad at them for treating it too lightly.&nbsp;And then she realises that, hey, they're actually doing way more than she is about it, and joins them. <br /><br />She has all these standards that she often fails to live up to, and that she's on tv shows us that we don't have to be perfect all the time, and it's okay that we don't live up to our standards. Just as long as we try.<br /><br /> And it's quite telling, I&nbsp;think, that Pierce keeps labelling her a lesbian, because well, on this show, Pierce is there to say all the things we know are stupid and wrong and racist and sexist, and well, feminists don't have to be lesbians. But they can. And that's okay too. I also love her friendship with Annie and Shirley because women should have more scenes together on television, and not just when they're discussing the various men in their lives.&nbsp;And when I say these kinds of things, yes, <em>House,</em> I'm looking at you.</lj-cut><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><strong><br /></strong></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><strong>18. Sarah Walker</strong> <em>(Chuck)<br /><br /><br /></em></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://seat42f.com/images/stories/tvshows/Chuck/Season2/S0202/chuck-yvonne-strahovsk.jpg"" /></div><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">Sarah Walker actually confused me a fair bit for a while. On one hand, the outfits that she wears and the way the camera often shows her walking in slow-mo (looking gorgeous, of course)&nbsp;through the Buy-More appeared to indicate that she was overly sexualised and infantalised. I guess they do do that with pretty much everyone who walks through the store though. And anyway, this was less of an issue for me through season 1, and some of season 2, but I don't know, season 3 just started annoying me so damn much. But I guess, on that issue, she shows that you can be gorgeous and amazing? Like it's not an either or like it was in the library episode of season 4 Doctor Who, where that girl could only be gorgeous and dumb, or smart and disfigured.<br /><br />Season 4 is much better though, and I think part of that is due to the resolution of her and Chuck's relationship. The role of the unattainable hot arse-kicking chick felt very forced for me in some of the earlier seasons - like she was simply being portrayed as a male fantasy. And I guess, to some extent, to Chuck - in the first few seasons - she was. And that never really sat well with me. Because you know, she is so much more than that - she's a fully qualified CIA&nbsp;agent and she is so much more capable that Intersectless-Chuck. I don't really know what I'm trying to say here, just that I'm sort of a little iffy on <em>Chuck's</em> representation of women?&nbsp;Like Ellie, Chuck's sister: she's always the last to know things - like Chuck's spy status, for example - and when she does find out about it, she tries to put a stop to it. But this is slightly off topic. <br /><br />I&nbsp;guess the way I&nbsp;reconcile myself with this show's characterisation of Sarah is to remember that <em>Chuck </em>is essentially seen through, well, Chuck's eyes. And Sarah is beautiful and skilled and dangerous, and Chuck trusts her and everyone respects her - except Jeffster, who don't respect anyone, and are pretty badass (and annoying) for it :P&nbsp;- and in the verse of this show, that really says a whole lot. Oh btw, how unsubtle was the sudden change of hair colour to pitch black?&nbsp;Pfft. Why not put a neon sign above her head saying '<em>ooh, Sarah's gone to the </em>dark <em>side' ? </em>/confused ramblings end here. <br /><br />Anyway, would love to hear your thoughts. <br /><br />Also, because I don't think <em>Chuck </em>features anymore on this meme - General Beckman is the HBIC.

It's tragic and sad, and sure, at first glance, it sort of reminds me of the princess in the tower just waiting for the prince to rescue her, but Clare isn't really like that.&nbsp;In fact, if you think about it, it's more that she's rescuing Henry, that she's taking him out of his metaphorical tower and giving him a chance at a real life. <br /><br />And she's an artist and I love that she makes birds, because I love birds too, and I love that she can express her hurt and her emotions through her art. It reminds me of Penelope waiting for her husband to come home and knitting and unknitting to keep the men away from her door. It reminds me of the Lady of Shalott weaving the pictures from her mirror. It's a release and it's freedom of a sort. It's beautiful.<br /><br />It's a love story, really, it doesn't pretend to be much more than that, and it's gorgeous and lovely and it's about the type of forever that only ever comes along every once in a blue moon. It's this circular romance that just goes on and on. And I&nbsp;love it because it's so very lovely and romantic and <em>sad</em>, because time travel is always sad.&nbsp;<br /><br />And who else is with me when I&nbsp;say that this is one of the most beautiful movies ever?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;<br /><br /></lj-cut><div style=""text-align: center;""><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;""><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2781/4111979290_8c357c6ec6.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><br /></lj-cut></div><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a>   || day 09:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91908.html"">cj  cregg</a> || day 10:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92218.html#cutid1"">maria  von trapp</a>  || day   11:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92630.html#cutid1"">alexis  castle</a> || day  12:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92846.html#cutid1"">elizabeth bennet</a>    ||  day 13:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/93418.html?view=1114090#t1114090"">kitty  walker</a>  ||  day  14: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/93418.html?view=1114090#t1114090"">martha  rodgers</a> ||  day 15:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/93418.html?view=1114090#t1114090"">nora   walker</a>  ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare  abshire   ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry    ||&nbsp;day 18:    sarah walker ||&nbsp;day   19:  donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20:   annie  edison    ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie  tyler   ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day   23: hermione   granger   || day 24:  sarah walker   || day 25: caroline    julian  ||&nbsp;day  26:     bertha/antoinette rochester  ||  day   27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall   ||&nbsp;day 28 :     lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29:  luna    lovegood || day  30: martha  jones  ||"

"event","So I've missed a couple of days, so have a multiple day post:&nbsp;<br /> <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt="""" src=""http://seat42f.com/images/stories/calista-flockhart-brothers-sisters.jpg"" /></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br />Day 13:&nbsp;<strong>Kitty Walker </strong><em>(Brothers &amp;&nbsp;Sisters)<br /><br /></em></div><div style=""text-align: left;""><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">Kitty was originally presented as this smart, capable woman that I could really love, and for a season or so that's what she was. And I really loved her -&nbsp; she was amazing at her job, she was brave and she was comfortable enough with herself to propose to Robert herself. And during that first season, yeah, she made mistakes, and she tried to bribe the Senator, but failed and had enough humility to apologise on national television. I&nbsp;found her antagonistic relationship with her mother interesting as well, but it always came back to how much they loved each other. Which was lovely, but not really enough meat for me to delve into. <br /><br />Throughout the seasons she has evolved ... becoming much less into her professional life and much more into her home life, what with wanting the baby and all. And I hated how she was presented, towards the end of the second season, as holding Robert back from more. Although, you could also interpret that one as her being his moral compass, but that annoys me a bit too - why can't he be his own moral compass?&nbsp;But yeah, the baby ... you know, at first, the whole Kitty is now a happy little housewife thing they had going on for a bit pissed me off at first, but you know, I&nbsp;got over myself. Because it's okay to want to be a mother and a wife. That's what this - which wave of feminism are we up to now?&nbsp;- is all about. That we can be smart and intellectual and well-read and still fill those maternal roles. It's our choice. And that's pretty empowering.<br /><br />I don't know if this is an unpopular fandom opinion, but I really liked her cancer storyline as well. Didn't feel like it was well-resolved, but I&nbsp;enjoyed the sadness of the storyline and the way it brought everyone together in a way that they hadn't been since midway season 2. And I haven't been able to bring myself to watch the finale of season 4, or any of season 5 yet. It's just too sad for me. </lj-cut></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><em><br /><br /></em><img alt="""" src=""http://i33.tinypic.com/349clu1.jpg"" /></div><br />Day 14:&nbsp;<strong>Martha Rodgers </strong><em>(Castle)</em><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;""><br />I actually find it rather refreshing that <em>Castle </em>chooses to tell Martha's story. You don't really see <em>that </em>many women of her age portrayed in anything but a comic light on tv, and I&nbsp;think that's a great shame. I mean, you see men around Martha's age and they're usually distinguished or in roles of authority, but women are much less so. And a single mother who has done quite a fantastic job, and has a storyline of her own. Her experiments with - was it myspace? Her relationship with Chet. I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;might have ranted about this before, when I&nbsp;was talking about Cam, but we, as a society, tend to shelve women once they hit a certain age. They become irrelevant to us, because they are no longer young and beautiful (a lie here - Martha is gorgeous), or bursting with sex appeal or whatever. And it's stupid.<br /><br />I love Martha because she's smart and dramatic and dude, she dressed up as Cruella. What's not to love?&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><img src=""http://static.tvfanatic.com/images/gallery/nora-walker-pic.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><br />Day 15: <strong>Nora Walker </strong><em>(Brothers and Sisters)</em><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;"">Nora's kind of an interesting one, because while she's presented as the matriarch, she's also presented as neurotic and there's an obvious sense that her kids keep trying to protect her. And while she always shows them that she doesn't need protecting, the fact that they think she does is rather telling?&nbsp;I&nbsp;just don't think they'd have had this problem with William Walker is all.<br /><br />She annoys me often too, with her nagging and her (sometimes)&nbsp;ridiculously high expectations of the kids, but in the end she always ends uo making me love her. I don't know, maybe she's just a portrayal of how we don't have to be right all the time, we just need to want to be?&nbsp;And she always wants to be, and she deserves happiness, and while I'm not watching the current season, I hope she gets it. </lj-cut><br /><br />Anyway, basically my crime shows are better at writing women than my dramas. <br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a>   || day 09:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91908.html"">cj  cregg</a> || day 10:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92218.html#cutid1"">maria  von trapp</a>  || day   11:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92630.html#cutid1"">alexis  castle</a> || day  12:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92846.html#cutid1"">elizabeth bennet</a>   ||  day 13:  kitty  walker  ||  day  14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15:  nora   walker  ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare  abshire   ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry   ||&nbsp;day 18:    sarah walker ||&nbsp;day   19:  donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20:  annie  edison    ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie  tyler   ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day  23: hermione   granger   || day 24:  sarah walker   || day 25: caroline   julian  ||&nbsp;day  26:     bertha/antoinette rochester  ||  day  27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall   ||&nbsp;day 28 :     lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29:  luna   lovegood || day  30: martha  jones  ||"

Your final night.<br />Double, treble exposure<br />Over everything. Late afternoon, Friday,<br />My last sight of you alive.<br />Burning your letter to me, in the ashtray,<br />With that strange smile. Had I bungled your plan?<br />Had it surprised me sooner than you purposed?<br />Had I rushed it back to you too promptly?<br />One hour later&mdash;-you would have been gone<br />Where I could not have traced you.<br />I would have turned from your locked red door<br />That nobody would open<br />Still holding your letter,<br />A thunderbolt that could not earth itself.<br />That would have been electric shock treatment<br />For me.<br />Repeated over and over, all weekend,<br />As often as I read it, or thought of it.<br />That would have remade my brains, and my life.<br />The treatment that you planned needed some time.<br />I cannot imagine<br />How I would have got through that weekend.<br />I cannot imagine. Had you plotted it all?<br /><br />Your note reached me too soon&mdash;-that same day,<br />Friday afternoon, posted in the morning.<br />The prevalent devils expedited it.<br />That was one more straw of ill-luck<br />Drawn against you by the Post-Office<br />And added to your load. I moved fast,<br />Through the snow-blue, February, London twilight.<br />Wept with relief when you opened the door.<br />A huddle of riddles in solution. Precocious tears<br />That failed to interpret to me, failed to divulge<br />Their real import. But what did you say<br />Over the smoking shards of that letter<br />So carefully annihilated, so calmly,<br />That let me release you, and leave you<br />To blow its ashes off your plan&mdash;-off the ashtray<br />Against which you would lean for me to read<br />The Doctor&rsquo;s phone-number.<br />My escape<br />Had become such a hunted thing<br />Sleepless, hopeless, all its dreams exhausted,<br />Only wanting to be recaptured, only<br />Wanting to drop, out of its vacuum.<br />Two days of dangling nothing. Two days gratis.<br />Two days in no calendar, but stolen<br />From no world,<br />Beyond actuality, feeling, or name.<br /><br />My love-life grabbed it. My numbed love-life<br />With its two mad needles,<br />Embroidering their rose, piercing and tugging<br />At their tapestry, their bloody tattoo<br />Somewhere behind my navel,<br />Treading that morass of emblazon,<br />Two mad needles, criss-crossing their stitches,<br />Selecting among my nerves<br />For their colours, refashioning me<br />Inside my own skin, each refashioning the other<br />With their self-caricatures,<br /><br />Their obsessed in and out. Two women<br />Each with her needle.<br /><br />That night<br />My dellarobbia Susan. I moved<br />With the circumspection<br />Of a flame in a fuse. My whole fury<br />Was an abandoned effort to blow up<br />The old globe where shadows bent over<br />My telltale track of ashes. I raced<br />From and from, face backwards, a film reversed,<br />Towards what? We went to Rugby St<br />Where you and I began.<br />Why did we go there? Of all places<br />Why did we go there? Perversity<br />In the artistry of our fate<br />Adjusted its refinements for you, for me<br />And for Susan. Solitaire<br />Played by the Minotaur of that maze<br />Even included Helen, in the ground-floor flat.<br />You had noted her&mdash;-a girl for a story.<br />You never met her. Few ever met her,<br />Except across the ears and raving mask<br />Of her Alsatian. You had not even glimpsed her.<br />You had only recoiled<br />When her demented animal crashed its weight<br />Against her door, as we slipped through the hallway;<br />And heard it choking on infinite German hatred.<br /><br />That Sunday night she eased her door open<br />Its few permitted inches.<br />Susan greeted the black eyes, the unhappy<br />Overweight, lovely face, that peeped out<br />Across the little chain. The door closed.<br />We heard her consoling her jailor<br />Inside her cell, its kennel, where, days later,<br />She gassed her ferocious kupo, and herself.<br /><br />Susan and I spent that night<br />In our wedding bed. I had not seen it<br />Since we lay there on our wedding day.<br />I did not take her back to my own bed.<br />It had occurred to me, your weekend over,<br />You might appear&mdash;-a surprise visitation.<br />Did you appear, to tap at my dark window?<br />So I stayed with Susan, hiding from you,<br />In our own wedding bed&mdash;-the same from which<br />Within three years she would be taken to die<br />In that same hospital where, within twelve hours,<br />I would find you dead.<br />Monday morning<br />I drove her to work, in the City,<br />Then parked my van North of Euston Road<br />And returned to where my telephone waited.<br /><br />What happened that night, inside your hours,<br />Is as unknown as if it never happened.<br />What accumulation of your whole life,<br />Like effort unconscious, like birth<br />Pushing through the membrane of each slow second<br />Into the next, happened<br />Only as if it could not happen,<br />As if it was not happening. How often<br />Did the phone ring there in my empty room,<br />You hearing the ring in your receiver&mdash;-<br />At both ends the fading memory<br />Of a telephone ringing, in a brain<br />As if already dead. I count<br />How often you walked to the phone-booth<br />At the bottom of St George&rsquo;s terrace.<br />You are there whenever I look, just turning<br />Out of Fitzroy Road, crossing over<br />Between the heaped up banks of dirty sugar.<br />In your long black coat,<br />With your plait coiled up at the back of your hair<br />You walk unable to move, or wake, and are<br />Already nobody walking<br />Walking by the railings under Primrose Hill<br />Towards the phone booth that can never be reached.<br />Before midnight. After midnight. Again.<br />Again. Again. And, near dawn, again.<br /><br />At what position of the hands on my watch-face<br />Did your last attempt,<br />Already deeply past<br />My being able to hear it, shake the pillow<br />Of that empty bed? A last time<br />Lightly touch at my books, and my papers?<br />By the time I got there my phone was asleep.<br />The pillow innocent. My room slept,<br />Already filled with the snowlit morning light.<br />I lit my fire. I had got out my papers.<br />And I had started to write when the telephone<br />Jerked awake, in a jabbering alarm,<br />Remembering everything. It recovered in my hand.<br />Then a voice like a selected weapon<br />Or a measured injection,<br />Coolly delivered its four words<br />Deep into my ear: &lsquo;Your wife is dead.&rsquo;</lj-cut>"

She is born into a time where the only role of women was to marry and be a good little wife and produce fine strapping lads and heirs. Women were not valued for themselves, but rather, for their income and their belonging to a good, respectable family. And this is no more evident than in the entailment of Longbourne to Mr. Collins. <br /><br />And Lizzy sees this - she comments very regularly on the fact that they have no prospects and all that. She's not stupid. And she's not stupid enough to marry Mr. Collins either. She's usually the practical one, yes, but I&nbsp;love that she has enough self-respect not to marry him. And she's not even remotely tempted by Mr. Darcy's rather insulting first offer of marriage - she has too much pride and loyalty to her rather screwed up family to even consider it. And I love how she stands up for her sister who she believes he has greatly wronged, and true, she misjudged Wickham, but what the hell. She would have never run off to Brighton with him.<br /><br />So when she falls in love with Darcy and marries him in the end, it's an excellent excellent ending. Because you know that she refused him the first time - she wasn't willing to degrade herself just for money. And now. Now she's marrying for love. And yes, that is idealistic, and yes, I sound like a giggly teenage girl, but it's a marriage of equals. You know that she respects and loves him, and you know that he respects and loves her. And it's not going to be some patronising relationship like Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's, or some marriage for money and comfort, like Charlotte's and Mr. Collins (though I have heaps of sympathy and empathy for Charlotte), and you know that it's right. And it's good. </lj-cut><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a>   || day 09:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91908.html"">cj  cregg</a> || day 10:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92218.html#cutid1"">maria  von trapp</a>  || day   11:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92630.html#cutid1"">alexis  castle</a> || day  12:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/92846.html#cutid1"">elizabeth bennet</a>  ||  day 13:  kitty  walker  ||  day  14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15: nora   walker  ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare  abshire   ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:    sarah walker ||&nbsp;day   19:  donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison    ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie  tyler   ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day 23: hermione   granger   || day 24:  sarah walker   || day 25: caroline  julian  ||&nbsp;day  26:     bertha/antoinette rochester  ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall   ||&nbsp;day 28 :     lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29:  luna  lovegood || day  30: martha  jones  ||"

And you know, Maria is a huge part of that.&nbsp;She's so wonderfully idealistic and <em>ideal</em>, and so peppy and cute and I&nbsp;want her as <em>my </em>governess. She takes these children and ends up <em>caring </em>for them and loving them, and she gets that it's some attention and a bit of fun that they want. I&nbsp;love her interactions with each of the children, especially Liesel, and I love how she's awkward and scared of the Captain she gets when she realises she has feelings for him. And she/Julie Andrews is just breath-taking. </lj-cut><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a>   || day 09:  <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91908.html"">cj  cregg</a> || day 10:  maria  von trapp || day   11:  alexis  castle || day  12:  elizabeth bennet  ||  day 13: kitty  walker  ||  day  14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15: nora   walker ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare  abshire   ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:   sarah walker ||&nbsp;day   19:  donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison   ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie  tyler   ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day 23: hermione  granger   || day 24:  sarah walker   || day 25: caroline  julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:     bertha/antoinette rochester  ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :     lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29:  luna  lovegood || day  30: martha jones  ||"

I'm barely surprised. This is a country where women aren't allowed to drive a car. They're not allowed to be in the company of any man other than a close relative. They're required to adhere to a dress code that would make a Maryknoll nun look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded a hundred and twenty-one people last year for robbery, rape, and drug trafficking. They have no free press, no elected government, no political parties. And the Royal Family allows the Religious Police to travel in groups of six carrying nightsticks and they freely and publicly beat women. But 'Brutus is an honorable man.' Seventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren't wearing the proper clothing. Am I outraged? No... That is Saudi Arabia, our partners in peace.</em>&quot;</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;""><br /></lj-cut></div><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;"">CJ, CJ, CJ. Well. Firstly I&nbsp;adore Alison Janney, because she is quite ubiquitous and omnipresent. <em>10 Things I Hate About You?</em> Check. <em>Juno</em>? Check. And the best thing is that you hardly notice she's there until, you know, she's <em>there</em>. Amazing woman. :) <br /><br />CJ&nbsp;I&nbsp;do love as well, of course, but I'm going to have to keep this brief&nbsp;(Ahahaha, me. Brief. Ha.) because I&nbsp;have a stack of work waiting for me. CJ&nbsp;is strong and capable and brilliant at her job, and she was promoted in the later seasons over the heads of other men like Toby and Josh, not because they were any less capable, but because she was the best person for the job. How can I not love her?&nbsp;<br /><br />And she's so passionate as well - no matter what it is that she's morally outraged about, you bet she's going to be morally outraged about it. And it's not just a whinging thing - she actually tries to get things done about it. I have no trouble believing that she was the one who leaked in season 7. Well. That's not true. I have no trouble believing that she would have been mad enough to leak, but I don't know if she would have. Her loyalty to the President appears quite steadfast. But then, I'd also say the same about Toby, so, you know. Still undecided on that one.<br /><br />I kind of felt that she ended up being a bit of <em>main </em>main character by the end of the series too. Her stepping outside the White House and saying, <em>no, I don't work there</em> felt so very liberating. I&nbsp;do not doubt that she achieves great things and is very <em>very </em>happy. I am quite in love with her. </lj-cut><br /><br />Anyway, this isn't going to do her justice, so you guys are going to have to help me. Reasons to love CJ. Go!&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a>  || day 09:  cj  cregg || day 10:  maria  vonn trapp || day   11: alexis  castle || day  12:  elizabeth bennet  ||  day 13: kitty  walker ||  day  14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15: nora   walker ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare abshire   ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:   sarah walker ||&nbsp;day  19:  donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison   ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler   ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day 23: hermione  granger   || day 24: sarah walker   || day 25: caroline  julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:    bertha/antoinette rochester  ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :    lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29:  luna  lovegood || day  30: martha jones  ||"

She'll know that. The Mohawk Indians have a saying that when a child falls in the rapids, the one who rescues her will share in her new life forever. I assume that doesn't only apply to a potential drowning victim.&quot;</em><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;"">What I love most about Cam is how she came into the show, and we were all prepared to hate her - well, I don't know about you, but I was prepared to hate her, because I was fresh from <em>House</em> and Stacy and Cuddy and Cameron didn't exactly get along, and, you know, a fresh character with romantic <em>history </em>with the male lead was never going to be a good thing. But she ended up making me love her, and I&nbsp;adored the way she and Bones didn't have a petty bitchfight over Booth, and how they moved way past that, and their struggle for power,or whatever and ended up being friends. I love that she was more than a romantic foil for Bones and Booth. <br /><br />And she has been more than a romantic foil. As much as I miss Dr. Goodman, I think she is an excellent excellent boss, and we definitely need more capable women in positions of authority on tv. I&nbsp;love how she's able to be both a friend and a superior to everyone at the lab, and how they defer to her. I love how Hodgins is not the King of the Lab, but 'a loyal servant of the empress', and how she's not afraid to remind him - and everyone else - that hey, they do work for her. But she protects them too, and we've seen that from her first episode on the show, and it's what makes her such an effective boss and character.<br /><br />I also love that she's a mother, and that's something that's important to her. And yet. She's also allowed to have a life outside of motherhood. It reminds me of a Luce Irigaray essay that a friend made me read once ... I&nbsp;think it was <em>And</em> <em>the One Doesn't Stir without the Other ... </em>and it was about ... well, I don't know for sure what it was about, but what I took away from it was the way we don't expect our mothers to have an identity outside of being our mothers. And the way our mothers are expected to give everything to us in such a way that we become our mothers and then they no longer have any significance. BUT. My point is, I&nbsp;love how Cam is a mother, but also a mother with her own life and storylines outside of Michelle. She's an excellent mother. But she's also an excellent friend and, I daresay, an excellent girlfriend. I love that she gets to have her own love life, her own social life, an excellent worklife, while all the while being a mother. <br /><br />She also has the best expressions, comedic moments and sense of humour. Sometimes she says the wrong things, and then everyone stares at her and she is adorably awkward. I've noticed this happens a lot. &lt;3<br /><br />And because this entry is the last of my posts on these three super-excellent women of <em>Bones</em> (though I want to tell you all that I love Daisy too, I just don't have enough space for her in these 30 entries) - I&nbsp;thought this would be an appropriate place for my favourite <em>Bones </em>conversation:<br /><br /><strong>Angela:</strong> Well there you go. He was playing the field and someone probably nicked him for it.<br /><strong>Bones</strong>: How do you know?<strong><br />Angela</strong>: Because despite the fact that I would love to have my legs wrapped around one right now, men are awful.<br /><strong>Hodgins</strong>: Hey. Whoa. What'd I do?<br /><strong>Cam:</strong> You're a man. <br />[...]<strong><br />Cam:</strong> Are you aware that lionesses do all the hunting?<br /><strong>Bones:</strong> Yes, and the males simply populate and eat what the females catch.<strong><br />Angela</strong><strong>:</strong> And when they get cranky, they eat the cubs... Men.<br /><strong>Hodgins:</strong> Wow. Before I flee for my life, the particles I found in the wounds around the femeral artery, ones I thought were mica, are scales.<br /><strong>Bones:</strong> Fish?<br /><strong>Hodgins:</strong> No, snake. Can maybe have a species by tomorrow.<br /><strong>Angela:</strong> Hey wanna stay and have a drink? [Cam snaps her fingers] Oh yeah. We hate men.<strong><br />Hodgins:</strong> I'm gonna go now. </lj-cut><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a>  || day 08:   <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91791.html#cutid1"">camille saroyan</a> || day 09:  cj  cregg || day 10:  maria  vonn trapp || day   11: alexis castle || day  12:  elizabeth bennet  ||  day 13: kitty  walker ||  day 14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15: nora   walker ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:   sarah walker ||&nbsp;day  19: donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison   ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler  ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day 23: hermione  granger   || day 24: sarah walker  || day 25: caroline  julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:    bertha/antoinette rochester ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :    lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna  lovegood || day  30: martha jones  ||"

Not is she the only sane, normal person in the lab (although, I don't know - how sane can you be if Temperance Brennan is your best friend?), but she gets to say things like &quot;You know what you people lack?&nbsp;Whimsy. It's a genuine handicap&quot; to the rest of the team, and honestly, you know it's true. She's so gorgeous that the ugly people (on the jury) all hate her, and she is a little bit in love with Booth, and the hot courier girl picks her over Hodgins and Zack. <br /><br />She's incredibly supportive of Brennan, and she has this massive massive heart, and I&nbsp;think that she's one of those people who really does believe that she can make a difference, just her, herself. Case in point, that whole thing with the pig. And I&nbsp;don't know whether that makes her idealistic or whatever, but I love her spontaneity and her conviction that life is about being happy. Because, really, that's what she's about. She's a good time girl, and it's not a bad thing - in fact, I wish I lived my life like she does. <br /><br />I&nbsp;was reading an article earlier last month or something that was talking about her relationship with Hodgins and her relationship with Roxie. I think the point of the article was to point out how <em>well</em> the show wrote her character, because her relationship with Roxie wasn't written in for the salacious shock-value. (Is it just me or has it become really <em>trendy</em> for show writers to put lesbians on their shows and just use them to attract stupid men, as opposed to actually developing their relationship?) Instead, Hart Hanson and his writing team actually bothered to explore their relationship and it was just. It wasn't 'OMG, ANGELA IS&nbsp;A&nbsp;LESBIAN' - it was more like okay, now Angela's with Roxie, but this isn't going to work out because they're in different places at this moment, and now Angela's with Hodgins.&nbsp;And it just so happened that Hodgins ended up being her soulmate (or something less cheesy), and it just so happened that Hodgins ended up being a guy. Anyway,&nbsp;I don't know if&nbsp;I'm just summarising the article or putting my own thoughts into it as well, but I&nbsp;AGREE. Granted, I haven't watched Season 4 for a long time, so someone feel free to disagree with me. :) <br /><br />I think I had a bit more to say about Angela, but after that paragraph, I can't remember anymore, so I'll add later if I do.&nbsp;OH. I also love that she's an artist, and that she's not <em>clever</em>, per se, but she's so <em>smart.</em> If the Age of Reason is patriarchal etc., then Angela being clever in a more qualitative (as opposed to quantitative - maths, science etc.) way is totally resisting that patriarchy. Matriarchy!&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>   || day 07: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/91411.html"">angela  montenegro</a> || day 08:   camille saroyan || day 09:  cj  cregg || day 10:  maria vonn trapp || day   11: alexis castle || day  12:  elizabeth bennet  || day 13: kitty  walker ||  day 14: martha  rodgers ||  day 15: nora  walker ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17:  britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:  sarah walker ||&nbsp;day  19: donnatella  moss  ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison  ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler  ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||   day 23: hermione  granger  || day 24: sarah walker  || day 25: caroline  julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:   bertha/antoinette rochester ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva  mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :   lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna  lovegood || day  30: martha jones  ||"

"event","<u>a chance, darling,</u> pg, <em>house md.</em><br />cameron, house, house/cameron (house/cuddy)<em><br />&quot;She thinks about asking House what the hell he is doing here, in <em>her</em> city, but the words get caught behind her teeth. She swallows hard.&quot;</em><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&quot;Welcome,&quot; she says, with irony, &quot;to Chicago.&quot;"">She's sitting in a smoky dimly-lit bar when she sees him. There is a piano in the background, and the pianist sitting at it is slightly too talented to be there. By now, she's halfway on her way to being drunk, or maybe she's there already - in this fading bar, it's a little bit hard to tell. Her glass sparkles empty though, as she pushes it across to the bartender, Paul, a man who's just a little bit too handsome to be real, let alone cleaning glass tumblers and dispensing cheap alcohol.<br /><br />&quot;Bad day?&quot; Paul says as he refills her glass, a practised, easy smile gracing his lips. Cameron turns away from her ghosts and tries to focus on Paul.<br /><br />&quot;Sorry?&quot; she asks.<br /><br />&quot;I said, bad day?&quot; <br /><br />Cameron leans forward and imagines kissing him. &quot;Bad time of the year,&quot; she replies. She can see her reflection, distorted in curve of the many bottles behind him. Her smile is wide and red, and she thinks, with a shiver, of the Cheshire Cat. <br /><br />&quot;Isn't it always.&quot; There is hesitation in his voice and a crack behind his eyes, and she thinks she might just be able to fit in the hole in his heart. &quot;I finish in two hours,&quot; Paul says quietly. &quot;Wait for me.&quot;<br /><br />She nods slowly, and downs the contents of her glass in one long swig. Her throat is burning when she resurfaces, and there is a hand on her back. <br /><br />&quot;No need,&quot; House says. His voice is slightly thick and she wonders what he's been drinking. &quot;She's with me.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The cold night air hits her with a biting viciousness as they step outside and she tugs the hem of her black dress down and shivers. The street is deserted, but the skyline is bright. Across the street, a tired 24-hour store announces to the world that it is <em>open</em>, the neon light illuminating only the <em>o</em> and the <em>n</em>. <br /><br />She thinks about asking House what the hell he is doing here, in <em>her</em> city, but the words get caught behind her teeth. She swallows hard. <br /><br />He is watching her almost disinterestedly, but his eyes flicker over her face too quickly to be apathetic. <br /><br />&quot;Welcome,&quot; she says, with irony, &quot;to Chicago.&quot;<br /><br />He waits, but you know, he lied, and being the one asking the questions doesn't make her smart, or intelligent -it just makes her needy. And on tonight, of all nights, Cameron doesn't want to need anyone again.<br /><br />&quot;There was a conference,&quot; he says, and the words are like a peace offering. &quot;Cuddy made me go.&quot; <br /><br />Her shoulders sag slightly as she reaches forward to hail a cab. &quot;And since when,&quot; she asks, &quot;do you -&quot; <em>do what Cuddy tells you?</em> &quot;- go to conferences?&quot; He opens his mouth to answer, and if they were back in Princeton, this would his cue to say <em>she makes it worth my while </em>with a leer. And maybe she'd allow herself a wry grin, or maybe a disapproving frown. But here in Chicago, the lights are bright and his innuendo only really worked when there was an audience and a sea of lies to cover them. It doesn't work when he'd be telling the truth. <br /><br /> A screech of the brakes, and she pulls open the taxi door. &quot;I'm going home.&quot; <br /><br />Her words are final, but she leaves the car door open, and after a moment, he climbs in. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Looking out of the window, the buildings blur, and the colours bleed into each other, and after a while, she lolls back on her seat. <br /><br />&quot;I'm thinking of asking her to marry me.&quot; His voice cuts through the space between them, and she glances up at him. His face is earnest, oh-so-earnest, but confessions of <em>Cameron, I love you</em>, ring in the air between them, and she's not playing his game again.<br /><br />Instead, she laughs, and it's a strange, hollow laugh that lingers on after her mirth has died away. &quot;No,&quot; she says, &quot;you're not.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;No, I'm not,&quot; he agrees, and it's like a test she passed. &quot;Dr. Cameron,&quot; he continues. There is a sadistic humour in his voice that is too thick to be real. &quot;You don't still <em>love</em> me, do you?&quot; <br /><br />It'd be too easy to laugh here, to brush away their shared history with a sweep of her hand. But they can both hear their last parting echoing in the confined space, and she's not really in the mood for inhibition. &quot;Cuddy's good for you,&quot; she tells him,  because Wilson emails her sometimes and tells her that this is true. She doesn't reply to his emails. &quot;And I hate you now, remember?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I remember,&quot; he says, and she can see words brewing behind his careful smirk. <br /><br />They pull up at her curb and he opens the door and limps out. <br /><br />&quot;You have a strange way of hating someone,&quot; the cabbie says as she reaches for her wallet. His name, she can just read, from his license, is Bill, and a family portrait on his dashboard tells her that he has three children.<br /><br />&quot;Shut up,&quot; she says tiredly, shoving a bill into his outstretched hand. &quot;And keep the change.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />They're outside her apartment door, and there is a dead hush in the air between them. She makes no move to reach for her keys. <br /><br />&quot;You're good at this,&quot; he says suddenly.<br /><br />She should just open her door now and get inside, she thinks. Shut the door between them and go to bed and wake up with a splitting headache in the morning. But maybe it's inertia keeping her there, or maybe she just can't move, because she doesn't.<br /><br />&quot;What, House,&quot; she says, and there is anger lining her words. &quot;What is it that I'm so good at this time? Marriage? Want to make some joke  about black widows and dead husbands and Chase? Running away? I get it, okay?&quot; She takes a deep breath to steady her shaking hands, and steps forward into his space. &quot;What I want to know,&quot; she says, &quot;is why you're still following me.&quot;<br /><br />He looks at her, and she realises that he has nothing left to say. She turns away, turns to take her keys out. <br /><br />&quot;What happened around this time of the year?&quot; His question is quieter that she expected, but retains the sharpness that always belies his tone. <br /><br />Back to him, Cameron closes her eyes and resists the temptation to rest her head against the door. She thinks of the end of the dock, of the overturned boat. Hears the shouting voices and the pounding feet. The slamming doors and the constant file of men entering and leaving the house like stage directions. She thinks of Paul, her husband with the same name as the bartender, and Joe. Airports too, and reunions and partings. She hasn't been home in fifteen years. <br /><br />&quot;Everything.&quot; The soft melodrama reverberates around them as she finally wrestles the door open.<br /><br />&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, &quot;I thought so.&quot; <br /><br />She turns to face him. Shadows dance across her face. <br /><br />&quot;You have a couch, don't you?&quot; He says brusquely, and she raises an eyebrow at him. &quot;I didn't book a hotel,&quot; he admits. <br /><br />Cameron smiles. &quot;I figured,&quot; she says, turning from him and stepping into her apartment. The lights click on, bathing the room in a comforting glow. <br /><br />&quot;I don't know where this going,&quot; he says honestly, and it takes her slightly aback. She glances over her shoulder at him, and he's still standing outside. <br /><br />&quot;Yeah, well.&quot; She sways slightly on the spot, and if truth be told, she just doesn't want to be alone in her apartment tonight. His eyes soften, barely perceptibly, and maybe there's still some part of him that still knows her. Maybe. His forehead is more furrowed than ever, and in the dim light, cobwebs seem to line his eyes. <br /><br />&quot;I'll be gone in the morning,&quot; he promises, and steps over the threshold. </lj-cut>"

What if you could have that power, now? In every generation, one Slayer is born, because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. [points to Willow] This woman... is more powerful than all of them combined. [Willow whimpers] So I say we change the rule. I say my power... should be our power. Tomorrow, Willow will use the essence of the Scythe to change our destiny. From now on, every girl in the world who might be a Slayer, will be a Slayer. Every girl who could have the power, will have the power, can stand up, will stand up. Slayers... every one of us. Make your choice. Are you ready to be strong?&quot;</em><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;""><em><br /></em><br />So I didn't actually get into <em>Buffy</em> until long after it was finished. Only a couple of years ago, in fact. But you know, apart from missing out on the whole tension-filled journey, I actually think it was a good thing. Because it meant that I could take a step back and appreciate the show on a different level. It's interesting, you know, because this has been labelled a feminist show over and over again, or a feminist text or whatever. (Obviously I&nbsp;haven't read enough of the critiques, but you get the idea.) And there was a point when I&nbsp;was watching the show, when I&nbsp;wasn't sure that that was true. Because sure, you have Buffy and she kills vamps and she's the chosen one and she's not the blond girl who gets killed within the first five minutes of the show. But is she really a feminist icon?&nbsp;I&nbsp;mean, she is still being directed by a bunch of rules and a bunch of old men. And then the series progressed, and she rebelled against the Council and at the series finale, she chucks out the rulebook completely and that pretty much nailed it for me. Go Buffy etc. :) <br /><br />But that's mainly on an academic level, and there are so many more intuitive reasons why I love Buffy. I love that despite her superpowers and all, she's a girl trying to work out how she's supposed to live in this crazy world, which sounds like it should be a line from an 80's song. :P&nbsp;I love that she makes mistakes, that she's confused and that she just has to keep fighting no matter what. She's this lovely mix of selfishness and self-sacrificial-ness, she's not simple, she's complex, she's confused. <br /><br />There are, of course, the obvious reasons to love her - she wields all this power, she can kick most guys' asses. But I also love her sense of humour, the way she loves, and how heavy a burden her gift is. Season 6 actually really hurt for me, because of how much she was hurting. I love that she's free to love two guys, instead of being restricted to that one monogamous relationship, that one true love. Because it's a ridiculous double standard, how guys are free to sleep around and accumulate notches on bedposts, whereas if girls do that, they're labelled sluts. But I love how Buffy manages to love Angel and love Spike and it's all okay. <br /><br />In a nutshell, I love Buffy because she walks me through this journey, of her moving on and growing up and becoming more and more comfortable in her own skin. How identifiable the conflicts in her life are and how she works through them, just how many mistakes she makes, how it's all okay anyway. Because despite the obvious differences in her life from ours, the entire thing is a giant metaphor and if she can muddle through, well, maybe we can too. </lj-cut><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a>  || day 06: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90946.html#cutid1"">buffy summers</a>  || day 07: angela  montenegro || day 08:   camille saroyan || day 09: cj  cregg || day 10:  maria vonn trapp || day   11: alexis castle || day 12:  elizabeth bennet  || day 13: kitty  walker ||  day 14: martha rodgers ||  day 15: nora  walker ||&nbsp;day 16:  clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:  sarah walker ||&nbsp;day  19: donnatella  moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison  ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler  ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||  day 23: hermione  granger  || day 24: sarah walker  || day 25: caroline julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:   bertha/antoinette rochester ||  day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :   lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna  lovegood || day 30: martha jones  ||"

"event","<u>The World As We Knew It,</u> pg, <em>House MD.<br /></em>House/Cameron, House/Cuddy<br />He hasn't seen her for five years, but dust aside, it's time to chase some ghosts again. <br /><br />A/N: This started off a long time ago as a post-<em>Lockdown</em> fic, and then turned into a post-apocalypse fic. I&nbsp;have no idea either. And yes, I know it's been a while. :)<br /><br />- - -<br /><lj-cut text=""And this, he thinks, is what he cannot stand about Cameron.""><br />&quot;Hey.&quot; His knuckles around his cane whiten. <br />She shifts around, adjusts her weight against the wall. &quot;<em>Hey.</em>&quot;<br /><br />He had seen her first, a thin shape through the tinted glass of the diagnostic department. For a moment, he had barely recognised her. She could almost be a ghost - he could almost believe her a ghost . <br /><br />Except now, a nurse walks by, does a double-take and begins to laugh. &quot;Dr. Cameron!&quot; The woman is unfamiliar to him, but this is hardly surprising. Even before she stopped working for him, Cameron knew people. &quot;Welcome back!&quot; <br /><br />Cameron's reply is soft and muted and he isn't really listening for it anyway, just watching the way her mouth curves around the words.  As the nurse walks away - sparing a curious glance for House, because people talk, people have always talked - a faint smile lingers at her lips. <br /><br />And this, he thinks, is what he cannot stand about Cameron. Her ability to get under people's (his) skin. The way she lurks in the back of his mind sometimes. The way they don't talk about her. <br /><br />&quot;Are you?&quot; he asks her now. <br />She turns back to him, traces of the smile dissolving rapidly. &quot;Am I what?&quot; <br /><br />Back, he wants to say, but it reeks too much of familiarity and something like nostalgia, so he holds it behind his teeth, along with other confessions he doesn&rsquo;t want to utter (<em>I missed you. Cuddy and I. You.</em>)<br /><br />&quot;Have you seen Chase?&quot; He can't tell if he asked or if she did, but she shakes her head slowly. &quot;Why -&quot; he starts to say, but her gaze has flickered away from his and alighted somewhere further up the corridor. <br /><br />&quot;It's nice seeing you, House,&quot; she says, walking away. <br /><br /><em>Why are you back? </em><br />He hasn't seen her in five years.  <br />  <br /><br /><br /><br />+ +<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The light is slowly fading out like the end of a very long play when he finally picks up the phone. The white piece of paper in his hands fluttering, he speaks the moment the ringing cuts out.<br /><br />&quot;Wilson,&quot; he says. <br /><br />His friend sighs. <em>I won't be a moment,</em> he hears him say quietly. &quot;House.&quot; There is something in his voice that House can't actually place.  They lapse into a silence that he doesn't know how to break. The paper weaves between his fingers, spidery black ink flashing here and there. <br /><br />&quot;You saw Cameron today?&quot; Wilson's voice is careful. <br /><br />House nods slowly and drops the paper. It drifts slowly down to settle on the floor. <br /><br />&quot;House?&quot; Wilson says again, and he remembers that Wilson can't actually see him. <br /><br />&quot;Yes.&quot; His voice is raspy and he is suddenly irrationally afraid that he has given too much away with the one word. <br /><br />&quot;She came by my office as well,&quot; Wilson says, his words now tumbling after each other in a mad rush. &quot;She looks good.&quot; He pauses. House knows what he's going to say. They don't talk about this - they don't talk about Cameron, or Cuddy or how at one point he had his life together and now - now he doesn't. &quot;She - &quot;<br /><br />&quot;She's not staying long,&quot; House blurts out. He doesn't know this; it was supposed to be a question, but he is overwhelmed by a sense of intense panic. <br /><br />Another pause, another gap in their conversation. &quot;Actually,&quot; Wilson starts, and stops.<br /><br />&quot;Yeah.&quot; <br /><br />The dial tone is loud in Wilson's ear. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />++<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He decides to go see her himself, because years ago, he was never one to walk away from a conflict. But that was before the plague - the biblical reference strikes him as ironic too - and before everything that happened. He misses the way he used to be. <br /><br />She opens the door mid-knock, and there is a strange sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that threatens to overwhelm.<br /><br />&quot;I saw the light on,&quot; he offers. <br /><br />It's a half-smile that Cameron gives him. &quot;We've done this before,&quot; she says, and they have. So many times. <br /><br />&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he blurts out. <br /><br />&quot;I'm not here to chase old ghosts,&quot; she returns. Her hair is dark again, he notes distantly, but her arms are folded tightly across her chest, and the familiarity of the stance makes him reach a hand out to her. <br /><br />&quot;Please.&quot;<br /><br />She relents - he can tell from the sympathy in her eyes, and trying not to flinch from the pity that must be there too, he pushes his way in past her.<br /><br />&quot;Got anything in your fridge?&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />++ <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />It's been at least an hour and he's still nursing his Scotch and occupying more than half of her sofa. The television is playing an old black and white movie and she's at a desk behind him, typing furiously on her laptop. If she's trying to ignore him, she's doing a startlingly good job of it, but the silence is getting to him. He's not good with silences anymore. <br /><br />&quot;Who did you lose?&quot; he speaks through the thick hush, turning to look at her. <br /><br />A few taps of the keyboard and then her hands still. Another smiles spreads across her lips. &quot;What makes you think I lost anyone?&quot; <br /><br />What makes him think she lost anyone. A year long spread of disease. Of terrible painful deaths. 20% of the population gone, 30% still hiding in their homes. Because all of them have lost someone, and out of all of them, Cameron's the one that attracts loss the most. <br /><br />&quot;I wanted to call you,&quot; she says abruptly. &quot;When I heard about Cuddy. I'm sorry.&quot;<br /><br />He laughs, watching her closely, waiting for the hurt to settle in. It doesn't. &quot;Trust you,&quot; he says. &quot;Out of all the people who could be sorry about this, you actually mean it.&quot; <br /><br />Her typing resumes. &quot;She was a friend.&quot; <br /><br />His laughter dies. &quot;Yes,&quot; he admits. &quot;She was.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;I didn't lose anyone,&quot; she says plainly. &quot;My parents were dead before I started working for you, as was my brother and Dan, my first husband. Robert is here somewhere and all my friends are still around.&quot; <br /><br />His hands pick holes in the stitching of the cushion cover he clutches in his hands. &quot;Well. Good.&quot; Bitterness seeps through the cracks in his voice. &quot;It always works out for you.&quot; <br /><br />She shrugs. &quot;Not always.&quot; Cameron looks at him, and if he's feeling Orwellian, he can almost see the layer of dust coating her skin from working the plague hospitals for the past three years. <br /><br />&quot;I'm a coward, you know.&quot; The vehemence in his voice surprises him as well as her. His fingers are shaking slightly as they clutch his glass. Cameron doesn't speak. &quot;I should have gone -.&quot; He breaks off, suddenly exhausted. &quot;It doesn't. It doesn't really matter.&quot; <br /><br />They nod slowly, in unison, before the strangeness of the moment strikes them. <br /><br />&quot;Why are you here?&quot; he asks roughly, because he's tired of being unsure, tired of being this version of himself. <br /><br />Cameron's smile is wide and sudden. &quot;I lied,&quot; she says, her tone bright. &quot;I'm here to chase old ghosts.&quot; <br /><br />House's lips are painful as they stretch into a slow smirk. &quot;Everybody lies.&quot; </lj-cut>"

And this is where I died. The first nineteen  years of my life, nothing happened. Nothing at all, not ever. And then I  met a man called the Doctor. A man who could change his face. And he  took me away from home in his magical machine. He showed me the whole of  time and space. I thought it would never end.&quot;</em><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""rose tyler: defender of the earth"">Rose Tyler. When we first meet her, she's nineteen, bored, and stuck in a life that isn't taking her anywhere. She's so much more than this. When she meets the Doctor, it's a mixture of curiosity, boredom and this promise of this other life - all of time and space, who could resist? - that drives her to go with him. And who can blame her, really?&nbsp;Except it's also kind of important that she hesitates - she refuses his offer first, because of her family, because of MIckey, because she's a little bit scared maybe?&nbsp;But the Doctor comes back for her. A second chance. Because whatever happens, Rose Tyler is <em>lucky</em>. Because she always gets a second chance - now, a second chance at this whole new life, later, a second chance with her father, and finally a second chance at a life with the human-Timelord Doctor. <br /><br />But even though she's this nineteen year old human, and he's this nine hundred year old Doctor, it's never about him saving her. From the very first episode, you have her, with none of his Timelord brains or his experience, and she takes what she does have - this time, a bronze in an under-seven gymnastics competition - and saves him. It's not the last time she'll do that. And that's part of what you have to love about Rose. She has nothing on the Doctor, but she never <em>ever </em>lets herself feel inferior and she never lets him tell her what to do and she never tells him what to do. It's a partnership. It's two people standing on a lonely beach holding hands. <br /><br />And yes, she does fall in love with him, and maybe that happens later. But she loves him first, she loves him, this lonely, terrible alien, this soldier from the Time War who has just killed two species so that the rest of the universe can live. He doesn't love him. But she does. And it saves him, really; it's just one more way she saves him. And at the end of the first season, that love is so much that she looks into the time vortex and becomes the Bad Wolf. She transcends the laws of time and space, and she saves people. All that power - all that terrible power - and her first act is to end the Time War and bring Captain Jack back to life. The last act of the Time War is one of life.<br /><br />It brings her arc in a full circle, and the Doctor's too - because <em>Doctor Who</em>, being a show about time travel is all about circular timelines. And the next regeneration of the Doctor recognises that too - his hand is made to hold hers. From being a man who despises domesticity - or so he says - he becomes part of her family.&nbsp;Christmas dinners. And it's a little bit perfect. <br /><br />She's brave, we know this, and she recognises the universe as being so much bigger than her. But she's selfish too, and oh so loyal. She's found where she belongs, who she is, and when it comes to leaving the Doctor, leaving this life behind in <em>Doomsday</em>, she just can't do it. She refuses to go, refuses to let him tell her what to do, and she leaves her family behind, just like she left Mickey behind all the way back in <em>Rose</em>, and she stays with him. And it doesn't mean she loves Mickey or Jackie any less, and yes, it is because she loves the Doctor, but it's also because this is what she's meant to do. Stand next - not behind - to him. Fight the end of the universe. Rose Tyler. Defender of the Earth. It's because she so much more than a daughter, so much more than a wife, a girlfriend. Women have always been defined in terms of men. Rose Tyler. Defender of the Earth. <br /><br />And they get separated and it's a little bit heartbreaking and I should wrap this up because who's going to read my entire rant?&nbsp;But she doesn't wait for him to come find her. She builds a freaking dimension hopper, and much as I&nbsp;would have loved for a return of Bad Wolf, I&nbsp;think it's amazing, and I&nbsp;don't doubt it would have worked even if the stars hadn't started going out. She runs through the multiverse, not just to find him, but to warn him and to save the universe. With a gun, and she's probably one of the only people the Doctor doesn't berate for having a gun. She's always the exception. And with each universe she goes through, she becomes more like him - a mysterious nameless time traveler. But she's still Rose. She's always Rose. He's always her Doctor. <br /><br />And her story keeps going. I don't doubt that she's in the parallel universe having insane adventures, and running from monster, running after monsters - always running. And there's always going to be a version of them together, somewhere in the stars, somewhere in time, because you know, Rose Tyler is the Bad Wolf. And the Bad Wolf goes on. <br /><div style=""text-align: center;""><br /><br /><img src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_P9MrfY_J-aE/TFUwVbZ1-7I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/_bEddiXsRI8/s1600/rose.jpg"" style=""width: 397px; height: 223px;"" alt="""" /><img src=""http://www.autostraddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/rosetyler.jpg"" style=""width: 307px; height: 223px;"" alt="""" /> <br /><br /><img height=""252"" width=""446"" src=""http://www.postmodernbarney.com/images10/eot209.jpg"" alt="""" /></div></lj-cut><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a>  || day 05: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90580.html"">rose  tyler</a> || day 06: buffy summers  || day 07: angela  montenegro || day 08:  camille saroyan || day 09: cj  cregg || day 10:  maria vonn trapp || day  11: alexis castle || day 12:  elizabeth bennet  || day 13: kitty walker ||  day 14: martha rodgers ||  day 15: nora  walker ||&nbsp;day 16: clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18:  sarah walker ||&nbsp;day 19: donnatella  moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison  ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||  day 23: hermione  granger  || day 24: sarah walker || day 25: caroline julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:   bertha/antoinette rochester || day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :   lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna lovegood || day 30: martha jones  ||"

And that, Detective Beckett, is why you're here.&quot;<br /><br /></em><lj-cut text=""&amp;&amp;&amp;""><br />Confession:&nbsp;I love Kate Beckett. I love her dry, sardonic humour, I love her hair and her jackets, I love that she's the best cop Montgomery has seen for a long time, I love that she's haunted by her mother's murder and that makes her that much more driven. I love that she could have done anything with her life - been a model!&nbsp;- but she's down at the precinct instead doing that whole fight for justice thing. I love how deeply she can empathise with the victims and that she knows what it's like to be on the other side of the table. I love how she doesn't want to be just another of Castle's conquests, despite whatever she might feel for him. <br /><br />She's so strong, really, is what stands out for me. She doesn't take crap from anyone and Esposito, Ryan and Montgomery all really respect her. Their loyalty to her really touches me as well - at the end of last season, everyone in that room was really rooting for her and they all looked so disappointed when Gina showed up. I love that she and Lanie have this bestfriendship going, even if we don't get many scenes with the two of them. So many shows have the women as antagonists of each other (<em>House</em>, I'm looking at you!)&nbsp;and I'm so glad that this show (and <em>Bones</em>!)&nbsp;doesn't have that. <br /><br />I mentioned <em>Castle </em>yesterday when talking about the binary opposites inherent in Bones and Booth, and I said that Castle was another show that had reversed the traditional:&nbsp;male - rational, female - intuitive roles. That I think is still mainly true, but there is significantly more overlap in these roles here. Which is good, really, because it breaks down the dichotomy between male and female roles. That being said,&nbsp; yay, Beckett's the one with the gun and the one who has to protect Castle. :P <br /><br /> Interestingly, I couldn't find many quotes of her talking about herself, which I could make a deal of - women only existing as through the eyes of men, but seeing as the show <i>is</i> called <i>Castle</i>, I'm not going talk about that. :P <br /><br />Anyway, If nothing else, I love that she was prepared to put herself out there, tell Castle how she felt, even if it didn't go the way she planned and i hoped. </lj-cut><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a>  || day 04: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/90213.html#cutid1"">kate beckett</a> || day 05: rose  tyler || day 06: buffy summers  || day 07: angela montenegro || day 08:  camille saroyan || day 09: cj  cregg || day 10: maria vonn trapp || day  11: alexis castle || day 12:  elizabeth bennet || day 13: kitty walker ||  day 14: martha rodgers ||  day 15: nora walker ||&nbsp;day 16: clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry  ||&nbsp;day 18: sarah walker ||&nbsp;day 19: donnatella  moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie  edison ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||  day 23: hermione  granger || day 24: sarah walker || day 25: caroline julian  ||&nbsp;day 26:  bertha/antoinette rochester || day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 :  lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna lovegood || day 30: martha jones  ||"

I'm a scientist. I can't change! I don't know how. I don't know how.&quot;<br /></em><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;..."">The first thing I love about Brennan is not really about her specifically, and more about the show, particularly the contrast between Booth and Brennan. I am completely enamoured of the fact that Bones is presented as the rational, scientific character and Booth is one with all the faith. Traditionally, logical thinking has always been presented as a male trait, and the intuitive reasoning was always supposed to be female. So I think that <em>Bones </em>has reversed this duality is quite super, actually. And you're also seeing more of this in other shows as well (<em>Castle, </em>anyone?), which I think is great. <br /><br />But Brennan, Bones herself, is pretty much who I would like to be. She's brilliant, beautiful and with an enviable ability to compartmentalise. She's a freaking genius, and she knows it - there's none of that false modesty, rather, she's so very arrogant about it. And she knows that she's amazing at her job; in that respect she is not - and has no need to be - insecure. She's pretty kick-ass with the self-defence and she's so independent and autonomous and she really shows that she doesn't actually need a man. And most of the time, she's unapologetically all those things. Except, sometimes she's not, and sometimes, even though she doesn't need a man, sometimes she <em>wants</em> love.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I love that she has this yearning to be someone who believes in love, and yet her ultrarational mind contradicts her. I&nbsp;know the conflict between Bones and Booth is supposed to be that age-old conflict between the brain and the heart, but really, I&nbsp;think that Brennan herself <em>is </em>the embodiment of the clash between the brains and the heart. Because no matter what she believes, she has <em>so much heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>And anyone who watches the show can really see it. She's amazingly loyal and she loves so much. And <em>The Verdict in the Story&nbsp;</em>really brought that home, when she was willing to risk everything for a father who pretty much abandoned her. And while we're here, can we put me in the band that loved her father's arc?&nbsp;<br /><br />Let's talk about Booth. No one who watches the show can doubt that she loves him, and everyone who watches the show is currently rolling their eyes at the obviousness of that statement. She loves him so much that she doesn't want to hurt him, and she's so sure that she'll hurt him. She's just protecting him from herself, and that's sad and that's love. That's so much love.<br /><br />And something I'm not going to bother expanding on - all her friends love her too. That's why I love Bones so much. THEY'RE&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;JUST&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;BIG&nbsp;HAPPY&nbsp;FAMILY. <br /><br /></lj-cut><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a>  || day 03: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89871.html#cutid1"">temperance brennan</a> || day 04: kate beckett || day 05: rose  tyler || day 06: buffy summers || day 07: angela montenegro || day 08:  camille saroyan || day 09: cj cregg || day 10: maria vonn trapp || day  11: alexis castle || day 12: elizabeth bennet || day 13: kitty walker ||  day 14: martha rodgers || day 15: nora walker ||&nbsp;day 16: clare abshire  ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry ||&nbsp;day 18: sarah walker ||&nbsp;day 19: donnatella  moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie edison ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler ||&nbsp;day 22: alma ||  day 23: hermione granger || day 24: sarah walker || day 25: caroline julian  ||&nbsp;day 26: bertha/antoinette rochester || day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall  ||&nbsp;day 28 : lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna lovegood || day 30: martha jones  ||"

Putting aside the fact that men always say that about the women they work with, I&rsquo;ll get straight to the point. I am emotional. I do bring it to my work. It&rsquo;s what motivates me. It helps me get into the heads of the victims, see what they&rsquo;ve seen, even if I don&rsquo;t want to. Even if it horrifies me. I think it makes me a better agent. If you have a problem with that, you can fire me. But I hope you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</em><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&amp;..."">Truth:&nbsp;if nothing else, I love Olivia Dunham for that quote alone. I remember first watching it and being all excited because <em>yes</em>., that is exactly what every single person out there - male, female, in the workplace, at home - should know. And it's sad that I have to be so excited about it, because it should be tacitly known anyway. I love that she's a woman in a traditionally male dominated work environment (hello, the FBI much?) and she doesn't feel the need to <em>have </em>to be unemotional and unfeeling. And she shows, to me, that it's possible to both be a woman <em>and </em>an effective agent. A&nbsp;quick aside - it actually reminds me of how in Enid Blyton novels, the characters you like and are <em>supposed </em>to like are the ones that embody the most male characteristics. But Olivia isn't like that - we get to see her with her sister and her niece in ones are quintessentially maternal roles. And yet. She's still one of the best agents they have on the force, and she works so hard and she's amazingly dedicated, and if you were going to take a role model for young girls off of the television screen (I don't know that I'd recommend that, but) , she's pretty much one of the best there is.<br /><br />And I love how amazingly loyal she is. From the very first few episodes, her story with John Scott shows that. I&nbsp;love that she loves and that she's so willing to put herself in danger for the ones she loves. And we see that again, many many times, in any of the Charlie, Peter or Walter storylines. And yet, she's not presented a saint - she's selfish too - especially seen by how she doesn't tell Peter about his glimmer when she first sees it. But you can't really hate her for it either, because - well, I&nbsp;can't speak for anyone else - but I <em>get </em>it. <br /><br />And because I've realised I have a thing for characters with <em>ghosts</em>, I have to say, I love her backstory too. :)&nbsp;</lj-cut><br /> <br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: <a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89690.html#cutid1"">olivia dunham</a> || day 03: temperance brennan || day 04: kate beckett || day 05: rose tyler || day 06: buffy summers || day 07: angela montenegro || day 08: camille saroyan || day 09: cj cregg || day 10: maria vonn trapp || day 11: alexis castle || day 12: elizabeth bennet || day 13: kitty walker || day 14: martha rodgers || day 15: nora walker ||&nbsp;day 16: clare abshire ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry ||&nbsp;day 18: sarah walker ||&nbsp;day 19: donnatella moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie edison ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler ||&nbsp;day 22: alma || day 23: hermione granger || day 24: sarah walker || day 25: jane eyre ||&nbsp;day 26: bertha/antoinette rochester || day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall ||&nbsp;day 28 : lisa cuddy ||&nbsp;day 29: luna lovegood || day 30: martha jones ||"

She wants hope. She wants to know that what happened to her wasn't the norm. Things can be okay, which means maybe they can be okay for her again.&quot;<br /></em><lj-cut text=""...""><em><br /></em>Any list of amazing female characters I&nbsp;make <em>has </em>to include Cameron.&nbsp;Quite apart from the fact that my shipping of her and House made me get into lj in the first place, her character has been endlessly fascinating to watch on tv. I loved the fact that she wasn't a super-confident, cool, poised character (overuse of adjectives much!) from the very start, rather we got to watch her develop in that respect.&nbsp;That she was portrayed as insecure and over-caring I&nbsp;found refreshing, especially in a viewing age when female characters seem to have to embody traditionally male characteristics (hard, cold, excellent at fighting, bitchy ...)&nbsp;to be considered cool. Not that I don't love those characters, of course.&nbsp;What I just loved about Cameron was that she was never particularly <em>sure </em>of what she was or what she stood for or believed, but she knew she had to work it out, and we got to see her thought process, erratic as it was at times. And she never stopped trying to do what she thought was <em>right</em>, and I don't even know when that started being a bad thing? And we got to see her transformation and how she grew under House's tutelage and above House's tutelage, before deciding that hey, this whole not-caring, misanthropic outlook just wasn't for her. <br /><br />I also find that she's this insanely tragic character with a background that we never really got to see fleshed out at all. Sure, there was the husband thing, but it always felt like there was something more, something they could delve into so much better, but the writers never seemed to do that and everything about her was also just attributed to the husband and her crush on House, which I thought was&nbsp;a huge injustice to the character. <br /><br />In that respect, I've also been finding <lj user=""fated_addiction""/>&nbsp;'s latest Cameron series hugely satisfying, honestly, this is what they could - should - have done with Cameron's character. And didn't. And that itself is also a tragedy. :)&nbsp;/melodrama. </lj-cut><br /><br /><br />day 01:&nbsp;<a href=""http://anti-social-ite.livejournal.com/89481.html#cutid1"">allison cameron</a> || day 02: olivia dunham || day 03: temperance brennan || day 04: kate beckett || day 05: rose tyler || day 06: buffy summers || day 07: angela montenegro || day 08: camille saroyan || day 09: cj cregg || day 10: maria vonn trapp || day 11: alexis castle || day 12: elizabeth bennet || day 13: kitty walker || day 14: martha rodgers || day 15: nora walker ||&nbsp;day 16: clare abshire ||&nbsp;day 17: britta perry ||&nbsp;day 18: sarah walker ||&nbsp;day 19: donnatella moss ||&nbsp;day 20: annie edison ||&nbsp;day: 21: jackie tyler ||&nbsp;day 22: alma || day 23: hermione granger || day 24: sarah walker || day 25: jane eyre ||&nbsp;day 26: bertha/antoinette rochester || day 27:&nbsp;minerva mcgonagall ||&nbsp;day 28 :&nbsp;||&nbsp;day 29:&nbsp;|| day 30: ||"

"">She holds his hand till the very last Dalek has passed, and they both breathe a quick sigh of relief. His eyes are large and hollow, his brow haggard. &ldquo;Daleks,&rdquo; he exhales, and in the dark, she can&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;s crying or laughing.<br /> <br />&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; Rose murmurs. The contours of his hand don&rsquo;t fit hers perfectly like it used to. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them, Doctor, I p &ndash;&ldquo; Her promise dies on her lips. She can&rsquo;t promise him anything. The stars are going out, in all the universes she&rsquo;s seen and she hasn&rsquo;t&rsquo; been able to do anything to stop it.<br /><br />She hasn&rsquo;t been able to save him.<br /><br />She can sense it when his breathing changes and a dangerous calm fills the space between them instead. His grip on her hand loosens and pulls away. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demands. A buzzing fills the silence and a painfully familiar blue light flickers and breaks through the shroud of black that surrounds them. He stands just behind the sonic screwdriver, his face contorted in mistrust. It breaks her heart, just a little more, just a little bit. He has never seen her, never seen her in his lives; sometimes &ndash; all the time - she hates this universe hopping.<br /><br />&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Rose replies, because she travelled with him long enough to realise that anything she says can be dangerous. &ldquo;I knew you once.&rdquo; <br /><br />He doesn&rsquo;t know her, and it&rsquo;s breaking her heart. <br /><br />The Doctor is still staring at her, and it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s looking at her first incarnation of him. The Time War is still stamped all over his face and she just can&rsquo;t leave him like this. She knows she can&rsquo;t tell him anything, so instead she kisses him. He tastes of hesitation and death and guilt, and she kisses him so that all he can taste is love, because she <i>loves</i> him. When she finally draws back, she can feel death coating her teeth, and she can only hope that he&rsquo;ll understand &ndash; understand <i>this</i> - someday. <br /><br />The sonic screwdriver is pointing towards the ground, and his face is masked in shadow once more. Rose thinks this may be a good thing. &ldquo;Donna, Doctor,&rdquo; she says urgently. &ldquo;You need Donna Noble.&rdquo; <br /><br />&ldquo;Donna,&rdquo; he repeats, and his voice is uneven. <br /><i><br />I love you</i>, she still wants to say, but all she can do is nod &ndash; he won&rsquo;t see her nod in the dark &ndash; and walk away. <br /><br />Her finger is poised over the big yellow button, when his pounding footsteps behind her make her whip around. This time, he is the one that reaches over and pulls her to him. He clings to her so tightly that she feels like she&rsquo;s drowning, or maybe it&rsquo;s he, who is drowning, but she can&rsquo;t really tell anymore, and maybe both of them are drowning and neither of them can save each other. <br /><br />&ldquo;You died, Doctor,&rdquo; she breathes into his shoulder. &ldquo;You died so many times. And then sometimes you lived too, but then &ndash;&ldquo; <br />&ldquo;Shhh,&rdquo; he says. He lets her go. &ldquo;Better not say.&rdquo; <br /><br />- <i>there was never a version of you that ended up with a version of me,</i> she wants to say; it&rsquo;s on the tip of her tongue. <br />She looks at him. Nods, one hand clutching his so tightly. He looks back at her and for a moment, all he can see is a lost little girl who wants her happy ending too. And then she smiles, her teeth gleaming white in the dim sonic light, and all he can see is a wolf, prowling the edges of her story and he opens his mouth to &ndash; exclaim? Stop her? He&rsquo;s not sure. But she has already pressed a button and his fingers, already tightening to keep her with him, close on thin air and all he&rsquo;s left holding desperately onto ghosts and people who were never there.<br /><br />Slowly, <i>slowly</i>, he unclenches his hand. Somewhere in the distance, a metallic <i>Exterminate!</i> rings out. He smiles. &ldquo;Donna,&rdquo; he announces to the world. &ldquo;Donna Noble. It&rsquo;ll be my pleasure.&rdquo; <br /><br />---<br /><br />&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the Doctor says, his voice cutting across the silent beach, the wind tugging noiselessly at his hair. &ldquo;What did you do while I was away?&rdquo;<br /> <br />Out of the corner of her eye, Rose can see her mother with her back turned towards the two of them, clutching at her mobile like a lifeline. Snatches of conversation whip around her mother&rsquo;s turned head and drift back towards the two of them, standing a metre or so apart as if she hadn&rsquo;t crossed universes to get to him and he hadn&rsquo;t burnt up a sun to say goodbye. <br />The Doctor coughs awkwardly and she realises, belatedly, that he&rsquo;s still waiting for an answer. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she stalls, &ldquo;what did you say?&rdquo;<br /><br />He shrugs. &ldquo;What did you do while I was away?&rdquo; he repeats carefully, eyes searching hers for something soft and yielding.<br />Rose tries to smile. &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she says, and stops, because what can she tell him that he wants to know? What does she want him to know? &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she tries again. <i>I searched the multiverse for a version of you, the right version of you. I found your Eleventh incarnation, your twelfth, I found none at all.</i> She doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. So many Doctors. So much dying. <br /><br />&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Rose says gently, and it&rsquo;s true. Her hand closes around his. They&rsquo;re not them, but they&rsquo;re here and now. <br /><br />The waves slowly retreat from the white sand.<br /><br />- --</lj-cut>"

Her back is facing him and she looks smaller than usual. There is a thoughtful hunch weighing down on her shoulders along with some extra weight.<br /> <br />There is still a considerable distance between them when she speaks. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to the funeral.&rdquo; <br /><br />He pauses. If he were talking to anyone else, he&rsquo;d say he was surprised. But it&rsquo;s Cameron, and he&rsquo;s House, and they &ndash; they&rsquo;ve done this so many times before that the lines are almost engraved into their skin. <br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; she says. Her back is still facing him and the smooth white expanse of her labcoat makes him uncomfortable. Something that&rsquo;s made of all imaginable colours shouldn&rsquo;t look this blank. Empty. <br /><br />&ldquo;Went to my father&rsquo;s. Funerals are overrated.&rdquo; He slides into the seat next to her. There is a cookie in the middle of a plate that still bears the remains of a salad: wilted lettuce leaves forming a frame around it. He reaches over for it.<br /> <br />&ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; she replies. Any other time, there may have been a touch of amusement in her voice, but now, instead, there is a rawness that grates on the back of his throat along with the dry cookie crumbs. <br /><br />&ldquo;You went,&rdquo; he says flatly. <br /><br />Cameron turns to face him, finally. The shadows under her eyes seem to have spread. She doesn&rsquo;t reply. The silence makes him uncomfortable. <br /><br />&ldquo;He was your friend,&rdquo; he offers. It&rsquo;s a weak consolation, but he doesn&rsquo;t do consolations often and now it&rsquo;s all he has. <br /><br />Her gaze lifts from his skin. He&rsquo;s not sure why he sought her out, apart from the fact that she&rsquo;s <i>changed</i>, and he can&rsquo;t read her anymore. Except that maybe he never could. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she says, and this time it&rsquo;s her turn to be flat and emotionless. &ldquo;I barely knew him.&rdquo; <br /><br />It&rsquo;s too loud an echo of what he&rsquo;s been hearing since Thirteen and Foreman got back from Kutner&rsquo;s apartment and it spreads across the cafeteria like a bloodstain. &ldquo;You knew him,&rdquo; he shoots back. His voice is a bit too brusque, a bit too rough. &ldquo;All of you, you knew him.&rdquo; <br /><br />She shrugs. The Cameron he remembers would have been fazed by his vehemence. &ldquo;I work in the ER. The diagnostics department is multiple floors up from me.&rdquo; Thus the basis of its appeal, he doesn&rsquo;t say. He&rsquo;s not used to inhibition, but somehow the words don&rsquo;t seem to belong here. <br /><br />&ldquo;I remember. You <i>quit</i>.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a long-overdue accusation and he&rsquo;s not sure how they got from talking about Kutner to talking about their old team. House isn&rsquo;t the type of person who regrets, but if he did, this might make it on the list. <br /><br />A frown crinkles the space between her eyebrows and knits them together. There isn&rsquo;t room between them for this entire conversation. Instead, it has to be dispersed between other conversations, one line dropped at a time. <br /><br />&ldquo;<i>You</i> knew him,&rdquo; she says directly, instead, and he blinks. <br /><br />&ldquo;I was his boss,&rdquo; he replies sharply, but her bluntness clears away the platitudes lining his head. He&rsquo;s tired. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agrees, as if his statement proves her point. She&rsquo;s tired too. Her arms come up from the table, and her palms open as if for a blessing as she rests her head in her hands. Her eyes are tempted to close, but she&rsquo;s leaving them open for politeness&rsquo; sake, he can tell. This is something he recognises about her. <br /><br />Under the table, his hands twist in each other, his cane resting on his aching leg. He wants &ndash; no, needs &ndash; something to kill the pain. One hand reaches unconsciously for the pill bottle in his pocket. <br /><br />At the characteristic rattle, Cameron looks up, her eyes suddenly weary and old. His hand freezes; cat in the spotlight. <br /><br />&ldquo;Want more cookies?&rdquo; he says instead, something that&rsquo;s almost like a smile twisting his lips. <br /><br />It takes a moment for her to nod, and another for her lips to curl, slightly. <br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re paying,&rdquo; he says as he eases out of his seat and grabs her wallet from the tabletop. She doesn&rsquo;t reply, but when he looks over his shoulder, her head is back in her hands and this time, her eyes are closed. <br /><br />He almost smiles. </lj-cut>"

"event","<u><strong>Another Poem About The Heart<br /></strong></u><br />When the floor drops out, as it has now,<br />you cannot hear the squirrel on the wire<br />outside your window, the wheels spinning<br />on the road below. You want only pity<br />and are presented with the unbelievable<br />effrontery of a world that moves on.<br />But wait: this is not the person you are.<br />You're the kind of person who<br />sits in dark theaters crying at the collarbones<br />that curve across the dancers' chests,<br />at the proof of a perfection they represent;<br />a person who goes out walking in a four-day drizzle,<br />sees a pot of geraniums and is seized, overcome<br />by how they can bring so much (what else<br />can you call it?) joy. You love the world,<br />are sure, at least, that you have. But be truthful:<br />you only love freely things that have nothing<br />to do with you. You're like a matchstick house:<br />intricately constructed but flimsy and hollow inside.<br />You're a house in love with the trees beside you -<br />able to look at them all day, aware of how faithful they are -<br />but unable to forgive that they'd lie down<br />leaving you exposed and alone in a large enough storm.<br />-- Jenn Habel.<br />"

And maybe it&rsquo;ll change everything, or maybe it won&rsquo;t change much at all, but one thing she does know is that something <i>will</i> change. And for once she can&rsquo;t bring herself to think of the consequences, can&rsquo;t bring herself to take one of those necessary steps backwards &ndash; <i>to protect herself</i>, that&rsquo;s what she whispers at night when it&rsquo;s late and she can&rsquo;t sleep (alone) &ndash; just can&rsquo;t stop. Her heart is heavy in her chest and for a moment she feels full. So this, she can&rsquo;t help thinking, is what it feels like to be unconditionally alive. It might just frighten her, but she&rsquo;ll never let on. <br /><br />She&rsquo;s not sure who gives the order to retreat, but they&rsquo;re moving apart, slowly. She takes a moment to take stock of herself, finding the edges where she ends and the space between them begins and smoothing the creases over. Slightly parted, her lips curve: midway between a smile and an &lsquo;<i>oh</i>&rsquo; of surprise. <br /><br />&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he says. <br /><br />She closes her mouth. &ldquo;Hey.&rdquo; <br /><br />His hands have returned to his pockets, withdrawing quickly from this moment. She&rsquo;s slightly uncomfortable, but somehow, this &ndash; whatever this is &ndash; isn&rsquo;t <i>awkward</i>. She crosses her arms across her chest. <br /><br />&ldquo;I &ndash;&rdquo; Foreman begins, the word falling from his mouth like a peace offering. <br /><br />The smile spreading across her lips is almost involuntary, and it feels &ndash; well. It feels good. He grins too, and in this small room, just a few floors away from the Diagnostics Department, or maybe just a few doors down, their &ndash; is it too soon to call it happiness? &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t seem out of place. <br /><br />&ldquo;The party&rsquo;s downstairs,&rdquo; she offers, sinking into a seat. <br /><br />&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; he agrees. The chair beside her flattens beneath his weight. <br /><br />A moment rests between them, his fingers finding hers, gently. She&rsquo;s not sure how she got here. How she reached this &ndash; point Z &ndash; from being <i>Thirteen. Just Thirteen</i>, but for a moment she just allows herself to be. She can almost feel the silhouette of Remy, Remy Hadley lurking in the corners of the room, and she welcomes her, ghosts of her mother and all. <br /><br />She squeezes Foreman&rsquo;s hand. Their smiles linger. <br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

It's a moment, I think - a tiny moment between them that would have made everything so much sadder, but so much better. One quibble I had with Journey's End was the lack of interaction between Rose and the Doctor during the episode, although to be fair, there wasn't much time, and she did get that big scene at the end. It just felt like after all that build-up in The Stolen Earth, everything just petered out to, well, not much. And considering she's been given all this narrative build-up during the entire season, it felt very much like an anti-climax. I'd also have liked to have seen a moment where Rose tells the Doctor that Davros is wrong about the Destroyer of the Universe and all, but I&nbsp;think we all know my issues on that point."

Her gaze flickers emptily across the walls and when she speaks, her voice is hoarse and her eyes do not seek him out. <br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve redecorated.&rdquo; <br /><br />He shrugs, pushing his hands deeper into his pockets. &ldquo;Yeah. Do you like it?&rdquo; <br /><br />She rests her head against the wall, eyes threatening to drift shut. &ldquo;Does it matter?&rdquo; <br /><br />He wants to say <i>yes</i>, wants to reassure her that nothing has changed, except that so much has. And she&rsquo;s not that twenty-first century shopgirl who took his hand all those years ago and she won&rsquo;t believe platitudes anymore. &ldquo;It might to you,&rdquo; he says gently instead. He shifts his weight awkwardly off one foot and onto another. What can he say to this version of Rose that he doesn&rsquo;t know? <br /><br />&ldquo;And me, Doctor? Have I changed?&rdquo; There is a sharp edge to her voice that he almost doesn&rsquo;t recognise, except from the glimpses of Donna&rsquo;s memories, the ones he locked from her. <br /><br />He shakes his head. &ldquo;Not in any way that matters.&rdquo; <br /><br />She laughs. For a moment he wants to as well, simply to hear their mirth echoing around the TARDIS console room the way it used to. <br /><br />&ldquo;How long has it been for you?&rdquo; Rose asks. Her fingers weave together in her lap, and he&rsquo;s relieved to note that he does remember something about her, something she&rsquo;s still kept. He slides to the floor next to her. The grating on the floor is hard and unforgiving, but he can hardly remember a time when he cared less. Up close, Rose&rsquo;s face is strangely naked. Her make-up is gone and her hair is a darker shade of blonde, as if the Vortex has taken each strand and stripped it bare. <br /><br />&ldquo;Three months,&rdquo; he says, the words sour in his mouth. &ldquo;Give or take.&rdquo; <br /><br />She doesn&rsquo;t nod, doesn&rsquo;t shake her head either, and yet he&rsquo;s oddly pleased. Time. It&rsquo;s such a human construct that he&rsquo;s glad that she&rsquo;d asked it. Glad that there&rsquo;s enough humanity, enough <i>Rose Tyler</i> left in her <i>to</i> ask it. &ldquo;How long has it been for you?&rdquo; he asks, for want of anything better to say. <br /><br />Her face darkens. <br /><br />&ldquo;Years,&rdquo; she answers flatly. &ldquo;Give or take.&rdquo; There is something poised on the edge of her tongue, and he can see it in the depths of her golden-brown eyes and in the twist of her fingers. Her forehead creases, like a sheet of paper crumpling and her lips part, and he waits, waits for it to fall. &ldquo;<i>Jack</i>, Doctor.&rdquo; <br /><br />Inhaling sharply, his fingers tighten around the sonic screwdriver in his pocket and he nods slowly. It&rsquo;s not a condemnation, not in the strictest sense of the word, but somewhere between the cracks in her person, he can tell that it&rsquo;s a confirmation. <br /><br />&ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen,&rdquo; he breathes. Years &ndash; for her &ndash; and a metre stretch between them and he is suddenly filled with a desperate need to reach her across the space. It&rsquo;s strange, this feeling: a bit like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Except that it&rsquo;s him, not her, who is standing on a beach with his family &ndash; friends &ndash; still in reach, and she&rsquo;s the one carrying on her strange little life &ndash; always moving, never looking back. But her face is blank now, wiped clean of grief and guilt, and he&rsquo;s filled with an inexplicable fear that if he were to reach for her he&rsquo;d find that she&rsquo;s just an image. <i>No touch.</i> <br /><br />&ldquo;Donna went home,&rdquo; he gabbles urgently. &ldquo;There was no way, no way for a Timelord&rsquo;s consciousness to exist in her human brain. Humans, the lot of you, so small, but so beautiful &ndash; how on earth do you fit all the information you do in that tiny brain of yours, I&rsquo;ll never understand. And that&rsquo;s saying something &ndash; a genius, me, and yet when it comes down to it, I don&rsquo;t really understand anything about your species &ndash; well, that is to say, I understand more than most Timelords, but &ndash;&rdquo; He stops. Is she really human anymore? <br /><br />A silence stretches between them, ironing out the creases in the space and extending the distance separating them. <br /><br />&ldquo;She would have died,&rdquo; he pleads, willing her to understand. Willing himself to understand. <br /><br />&ldquo;You do that,&rdquo; Rose says suddenly, the emotion spreading across her face too intense for the blankness covering it just a moment ago. &ldquo;You save us, save us against our will.&rdquo; <br /><br />He looks away, following the curve of her shoulder as it melt into the TARDIS wall. &ldquo;I destroy you,&rdquo; he mutters; it&rsquo;s a confession. <br /><br />&ldquo;You make us into something worth destroying,&rdquo; she says, and an anachronistic gentleness laces her words now. &ldquo;We destroy us. Sometimes we want to.&rdquo; <i>Surely you understand that</i> is the unspoken end to her sentence, but they both hear it. <br /><br />The Doctor stares at her, his gaze penetrating the glass wall between them. It shatters, and somewhere, the pieces fall. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re angry.&rdquo; He states, but it&rsquo;s almost a question. <br /><br />It takes a while, but Rose shakes her head. Maybe splinters of glass fall from her hair, and maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit beautiful. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; <br /><br />There is a moment between her words and their actions that can only be expressed through the absence of more words, but. <br />The beginnings of a smile curl around his lips and brush the corners of hers. It&rsquo;s not quite happiness, not quite ease or comfortable familiarity. It&rsquo;s not even acceptance or forgiveness. But it&rsquo;s something. And maybe that&rsquo;s enough for now. <br /><br />Climbing to his feet, the Doctor extends his hand to Rose. She looks at him and something passes between them. <br /><br />&ldquo;Run,&rdquo; she murmurs, abandoning the hoarded-up word to the world. <br /><br />&ldquo;Run,&rdquo; he echoes. <br /><br />She takes his hand and he leads her towards the TARDIS door. There is an extra space for an extra person (or maybe more) between them, and maybe their ghosts circle their legs, but as they near the door, maybe they draw closer together. And maybe it&rsquo;s a work in progress. <br /><br />The Doctor pushes the doors open. Before them, London stretches, familiar and strangely haunted. Along the bank, the river twists, dark and winding &ndash; a journey home. Lights on the opposite shore shine, catching the ripples of water and leaping up in an effort to reach the stars. <br /><br />&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s here somewhere,&rdquo; he says softly. &ldquo;And Donna and Wilf and Sarah Jane and Martha. You&rsquo;d like Martha. Maybe.&rdquo; He turns to her. Her face shines golden, but this time, it&rsquo;s from the streetlamps reflecting off her damp cheeks. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;re all here, Rose. They&rsquo;re all here and so are we.&rdquo; <br /><br />Her fingers tighten around his and he clutches her hand in response. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s a start. Or an end.&nbsp;</lj-cut></div>"

The human!Doctor, while he is the Doctor, potentially, is, well, not the Doctor. And telling her to 'heal' him doesn't somehow seem fair either, because she's not the same person that she was back in S1. And I just can't believe that she's going to be happy with human!Doctor, because while he is an incarnation of the Doctor, he's still not the Doctor. It's like that whole theory with clones - that just because they're the exact genetic material (and in this case, not even that) of the original, it doesn't mean they're going to be exactly the same. And I can't believe Rose would be happy with that.&nbsp;And their parting really broke me up too, because it, like&nbsp; <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://teenwitch77.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://p-stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://teenwitch77.livejournal.com/""><b>teenwitch77</b></a></div>said, isn't an epic 'we're separated forever'. It's resignation and it's heartbreak and it hurts. It really really hurts and, I can't believe I'm saying this, somewhat more than <em>Doomsday </em>did. <br /><br />And I really can't bear the thought of the Doctor, alone. And because, seriously, he didn't have to do that. Why put her in a parallel universe? There another solution, there's <em>always </em>another solution - he has a time machine, for heaven's sake. And yet he did it because he thought Rose needed this, needed this happy ending, needed a forever that he couldn't give her. But he didn't <em>really </em>give her a choice in the matter, not <em>really</em>. It's <em>Parting of the Ways </em>all over again, it's <em>Doomsday </em>and he's there being all altruistic and self-sacrificial. Like with Donna. She was <em>begging, begging </em>him not to take her memories away, and in her situation, I would have done the same. I would have died there, like that, just happy that I was fantastic, that I had changed the world, that I had saved something not myself, and I would have been happy. But he didn't give her that choice. Why is he buying into the 'Lonely God' image that he's created for himself?&nbsp;<br /><br />But I really love the fact that Billie Piper can't let go, because I can't let go either. I just can't. I think her description in the Confidential as this ending being akin to <em>Beauty and the Beast </em>is very accurate, but then fallacious too, because the BatB image works more in terms of the regeneration, as one of my fics explored earlier. Here, the 'Beast', so to speak, is still there, still alone, still dying, waiting for that last rose petal to fall, and Beauty is off riding into that proverbial sunset with the Prince. But she's looking over her shoulder, always looking over her shoulder, how can she not?&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not saying she's not happy with this version of the Doctor; I do believe she'll come to love him, maybe she already does. No. I'm saying that she won't be able to forget the timelord!Doctor because they <em>are </em>different people. There is no way for two people to be absolutely the same person unless they are. And in which case they won't be two people.&nbsp;<br /><br />Which brings me to my bad wolf theory. I posted on time_and_chips asking if Rose on the TARDIS monitor was explained or not, and the answer I've received so far is that, no, it wasn't. And I want to know how she could have done that. The episode seemed to wrap everything up beautifully, and maybe it did and I'm just unwilling to, well, let go, but there are gaps in it. Gaps that maybe I just want to see.&nbsp;<br /><br />What if Rose still has that bit of the TARDIS in her? I don't believe for one moment that Bad Wolf Bay was a coincidence, or that the Bad Wolves appearing at the end of <em>Turn Left </em>was either. What if she lives and human!Doctor dies? What if? (see most recent fic. :P)&nbsp;<br /><br />This is not to say, of course, that the episode wasn't freaking amazing. Because it was. But I ... I'm unsettled. And it breaks my heart. Really. </div>"

Because while Torchwood etc. <em>can </em>save lives without him; they can think without him, they can't do it as well as he can. Because that's what he does. He <em>saves </em>people.&nbsp;<br /><br />- Rose is so lonely. She's still Rose and she's still brilliant at being Rose, but she's also harder and lonelier and there's this edge to her that wasn't there before.&nbsp;But she's still so kickass. I love her. I love RTD's writing of women. I love Donna. Lovelovelove.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although, her mother? Ouch! Harsh much?&nbsp;<br /><br />- Bohemian Rhapsody. *grins*&nbsp;<br /><br />- the choices. Parallel universes are so much fun. Except when you're stuck in them. And can't get back to the man you so obviously love. <br /><br />And on a different note - that 'labour camps. that's what they called them the last time.' nearly made me cry.</div><br />And that's all for now.

The actors were absolutely gorgeous - in acting that is (although the Rochester was very good-looking, although not conventionally), the use of the stage was inventive and clever and it tied in so well with the work we're doing on Lacon, mirrors, Kristeva, angels and whatnot. <br /><br />The thing about the acting was that it felt real. From where i was sitting, the emotions of the characters really leapt off the stage and I found that I could just about believe it. See, the problem I have with plays and stage musicals is sometimes I find it hard to believe, simply because the actors have to have such emphasis and enunciation that it feels fairly fake. But although the lines were enunciated perfectly, and you could make out the words completely, it somehow seemed to feel a whole lot more real. <br /><br />The actress for Jane, I thought, played her really well. I had a bit of trouble with her child-Jane acting, in that it felt exaggerated, but she grew on me as she got older and the play went on. I particularly liked her scene with Rochester when they're engaged and she's telling him that she will remain as the governess until they're married. And how she maintains that he will not dress her up - she is who she is. Maybe it's because I've read <em>'Wide Sargasso Sea' </em>now, but that really resounds for me, because she's not letting Rochester name who she gets to be, as Antoinette/Bertha did. <br />In the opening sequence, there was a scene with Jane reading a book. Except that it wasn't just Jane, it was Jane and her Other self - a more extravagant ... wild self,&nbsp;like the 'Other' that women have to stifle to become 'the angel in the house'. What I found incredibly clever was the way they used Other Jane as both Other Jane and Bertha. See, what happened was that the Other Jane was part of Jane - they were one person, it's not like she was schizophrenic, just sometimes the Other would come to the fore e.g. when she yells at Mrs. Reid. She was a bit like Hyde, really, and sometimes they'd have internal battles, so I guess you could see her as a little schizophrenic. Then, when Jane is in the Red Room, she stifles and tries to suffocate the Other Jane, and so when she's let out, she leaves the Other in that room - locked up. And she's then used as Bertha. I hope that made sense. I just thought that was really clever. The Other does get let out eventually - after Bertha burns the house down and Jane revisits - she takes the Other with her. And it's weird, actually, because at the end, Rochester and Jane are kissing or embracing or whatever, and the Other is clinging to Jane. As a friend put it - 'it's like some kind of weird threesome.' <br />But the actress for Bertha/Other Jane was particularly excellent. She was wild and she didn't hold back. She was ... mad. And rather eerie, if you ask me - the lighting particularly contributed to that. <br />Rochester! You know, I've never really understood that line where Rochester asks Jane: 'Am I hideous?' Everytime I hear that, I just want to scream <em>um, hello, no, you're not </em>because while they're usually older and wilder and tired and whatever, the actors playing Rochester insist on being insanely attractive. This Rochester, I really liked. He captured the spark that Rochester embodies and the darkness and the desperation and the primal lust, and he played the relationship with Jane so well that my friends and I were squeeing in the foyer during intermission. <br />The other actors were really good too - one disturbing fact - you know how Rochester has a dog? Well, that was played by a human male, not dressed up as a dog or anything, just on all fours and <em>very </em>convincing. And Adele was patting and stroking him and being all tactile with him because to her, he's a dog, but to the audience ... *grins* Yeah, disturbing. They even played catch! *amusement* <br /><br />Use of the stage - clever. Very. They had a permanent Red Room set up and Bertha/Other Jane was confined within that and at certain times, she'd parallel Jane or bang to be let out or tie herself up - no, not a masochistic thing, I think - and just act all round strange. The scene transitions were fairly smooth and worked really well. I found myself being really impressed by the way they did the fire/tower/Bertha dying scene - she opened a door from the other side and was illuminated by red light in the background and smoke was everywhere and then Rochester clutched her, she pulled away and the lights went black. <br />Just the only tacky thing was the way they used a pre-recorded soundtrack for the soundtrack (well, obviously) as well as horse hoof noises, rain and whatnot. But I can see why they couldn't really get a live orchestra. Or horse. Hm. :P <br /><br />And my goodness, there's a <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/wide-sargasso.shtml"">'Wide Sargasso Sea' adaptation</a> too!</div>&nbsp;"

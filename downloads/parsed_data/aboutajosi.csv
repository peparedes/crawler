"event","This is going to be the update of the century....which is just about how often I update this thing anyways. I'm putting off homework at the moment which isn't the best idea because I'm a little behind. So.......
First of all, I'm incredibly happy that I transferred. My classes are a little harder, but that not really a bad thing. Our apartment was condemmed, so we were all living in a hotel for a while, actually I still am. Darcy is a saint and found us a new place to live, its a little bit further away than I would have liked but thats fine. The yellow house broke because someone didn't pay heat bill, so they didn't want to refill the oil, so the pipes froze, then burst, flooding the basement. Then all the pipes in the house froze and the one going to the street. My fish is now in a frozen block of ice, I'm contemplating keeping him that way in the freezer of the new apartment, but I'm not sure Meggan and Darcy would appreciate it. The new place is $300 a month, but we have to pay utilities so it will probably end up costing the same as the yellow house. I have a feeling that I won't be seeing much of my roommates from there anymore, which is sad. The new place will lack furniture for a while, but I think that it will be fun. At least it will beat finding rides back and forth to the hotel. Alexi has been great about that though. He even lets me sleep in his room on days that I have to work. Darcy's friend Kristen came up for the week, she's a chill girl. We went out the bar last night to celebrate her 21st birthday. Darcy spent almost $100 by the end of the night, even after they gave us a ton of free shots. I really don't want to have to move, but I can't wait to have a place to put all my shit again instead of a hotel. So things have been hectic, good, bad, great, and stressful. And now I should catch up on that homework."

One time I was waiting for Sharon to come over and I looked out the window when someone pulled up and it was one of Max's friends, they started to get out of the car then saw me in the window and proceded to sit in the car for about 15 minutes. The same person was here the next night until at least 2 or 3 when I went to bed but was gone in the morning. Max is becoming more and more shady. I on the other hand have not had any booty calls, unless you count Shaz, which you shouldn't because there is no booty involved."

Then me and Darcy picked up her car and brought it home and went out for some lunch after helping her pack. Now everyone is gone. I don't think that there is anyone else home right now except maybe John O. but he must be sleeping. Meggan came back for the day but her and JD are finishing some lab report and she's leaving again later. At least Kerry will be around. Darcy is coming back for New Years and we're going to visit Meggan, but what on earth am I going to do for the next 10 days? I have to get all my school shit straightened out, I'm picking my classes tomorrow, and dropping off the financial aid stuff. I hope that those silly FAFSA people sent me the pin number so that I can send that in. I'm working for the next 4 days in a row too, but at least I'll have time to sleep. I'll finish Sharon's present tonight and stuff and everything will be cool. I was a little skimpy this year, but with that deposit due money is tight. I can't wait until the spring break so that I can go to Florida. Maybe I just can't wait until Christmas and all this stuff is over."

I know I sound really mean, I love my family....I just hate holiday's. The dinner at our house last night was nice, everyone was there and it was cool to see people all together. Grace's dinner was great too. Too bad Kerry couldn't go. It was an adventure cooking the turkey, but it tasted awesome. If only all Thanksgiving dinners could be like that.

Anyways. Here is the basic jist of things.

I thought that I had a little sty 
Right below my left eye
It was like a shining star 
and my face was a tiny sky.

But it wasn't a sty,
No no oh my
it was a peice of lint
and tasted nothing like mint
although I didn't really taste 
I didn't want it to go to waste

I can't stop the stupid rhymes in my head
I think it has something to do with the book i read
Again there it was
I think that i swallowed a peice of fuzz

The man outside my window is an ass
I wonder if an electric saw can somehow run out of gas
I hope he cuts his fucking hand
Its louder than a god damn marching band

My mom is now mad at me
I will tell you why and you will see
All she wanted to do was talk talk talk
I told her to go suck a big fat cock.

I wasn't in the mood for any chatter
and she just wouldn't drop the matter.
Sometimes I want to give her a smack
but she'd hit me 3x harder right back

None of the kids wanted to sleep last night
one wet his pants and one tried to bite
Frasiah yelled when i wanted her to awaken
She wouldn't have hit her with a piece of bacon.
But I didn't have one
so I didn't have fun

and one of the kids wouldn't stop screaming
the other staff must have thought they were dreaming

I really want something to eat
but I'm feeling really beat

The end. That wasn't all of it, but I took out some parts that when I looked at them later didnt' make any sense."

"event","This is going to be one of those entries that I delete in a few days. Its hard to explain. Today I was washing dishes upstairs and Cori came out of Wizzo's room and said hi. It was like seeing a ghost for a split second. She looks and sounds just like Jeni. I still think about Jeni and Lauren all the time. I never called them after we all left, we exchanged phone numbers and addresses, Lauren didn't live more than 20 minutes from me. In my entire life I have never met anyone who understood me so completly as them. I missed them so much but I still didn't call or write. Neither did they and I know exactly why. They were both so pretty, and fragile. I remember how hard Lauren tried to keep up with her school work. She wrote an essay once and the nurses got mad because she said in it that she didn't want ""it"" to be her whole life anymore, just a small part. They didn't know why she was fighting to hold on to this ""disease"". We knew though, its because after a while thats all you know, thats the only comfort, thats becomes who you are and if you lose it then maybe your heart will still be beating and your lungs will breathe but you know that without ""it"" you aren't anything at all. Jeni didn't have any strength to concentrate on her papers, and no one made her. Sometimes we would help her do a math worksheet but it was more just to pass the time than an attempt to keep up in school. In the end she coudn't leave her bed most of the time, that was hard, it took so much energy for her to get up and sit in the wheelchair, so most of the time we sat on the end of the bed and talked until she fell asleep. Jeni is gone now, we all knew that, even the nurses knew right away that she wouldn't get any better. I'm pretty sure that they didn't expect me too either. Lauren could have though. I think that the only reason that I did was because I hated the thought that they might be right. Unreachable, treatment resistant. They never understood why we wouldn't want to change. You can't explain to other people what its like. How do you explain being afraid of grocery stores, I still walk into Price Chopper sometimes and feel it. I'm not sure why I'm writing this in here. I need to talk about them sometimes, because they never leave my head."

"event","Well, Molly, the person not the dog, wanted people to update this more so that she would have something new to read when she is bored. I am now complying with this request. I must think of something interesting to talk about. Lets see. Right now I just came back from visiting Johnny, even though I never actually saw him because no one answered the door when I went over there so I walked home. Now I'm thinking about the possiblity of redoing the dest in my room so that it is a little bit more stable and I have more room. Maybe someday I'll buy a real bed too. That would be awesome because I have grown tired of sleeping on the air mattress. I should clean up in here too. That would be awesome."

"event","Everything is working out. I called today and they are setting up hours for me to work. I won't be making nearly as much money, but at least this is something that I care about. Those kids need someone that can understand them, and I think that I can, or at least I can try. There is no money in that kind of work, but as long as I make enough where I'm not going hungry then I'll be happy. My mom thinks that I'm crazy of course, but what else is new. Hung out with my brother for a little while yesterday. He is doing good, I guess. Summer will be over in a month, I'm not nervous about school, at all, which is kind of strange. I'm not excited either. Maybe I'll feel something more about it when it gets closer. Everything is kind of ho-hum right now, nothing exciting going on, nothing terrible happening. Mo is leaving soon, I'll miss her, but I don't know her that well. Sharon is going back to school too, I'll also miss her, but again I'm not incredibly broken up over it. She'll be back, and things will go back to how they always are."

"event","Bored to death, and in a bit of a bad mood. I now have a job and I'm going tomorrow to fill out the papers, and ""orientate"" myself. Yeah, this means that my parents will give me money. Thats a little odd, my mom's logic is if I have a job she will give me money, but if not then I'm on my own. Silly. 
Upside: I'm listening to Oasis. I like Oasis. ha ha."

thats much easier than telling each individual, but this means that I had better start getting a ton of instant messages reminding me of how very special I am, or how scary, whatever you want."

"event","so if not *that* then what am I? Sometimes it feels like I've lost my identity. I can tell that its going to start again, and that is the very last thing that I need on top of everything else at this point. Its like a huge rain cloud sitting over me, ready to burst open again at any moment. How can you live like that? With constant impending doom. I'm just not sure what direction to go in anymore, and there is nothing I can do and no one to talk to or to help me. I'm going to stop complaining though, because that makes things worse."

"event","Yeah well. Things have been......heavy? lately. Still need $244 for rent. Elaine (the lady supposed to be getting me a job) is away on vacation, so all I can do is wait on that. I've applied for other jobs, I guess I'll call my mom and see if her boss needs anything done. I used to work there, but they were overstaffed. I must have something of value that I can pawn or something, maybe my TV, it isn't even hooked up, or that necklace. Damn, this sucks. I can probably get like $30 for a bunch of CD's across the street, I don't really want to sell all my Nirvana ones though. Anyways, enough about the $$$$$ problem, I'll deal with it, and if I have to stash my stuff at Sharon's and sleep in the park for a bit its ok. Won't be the first time. Next order of business. Lets see..... Sharon is coming in 15 min to get me so that we can go chill and she wants to call Patrick and have him come over for a bit. Patrick is interesting, we used to hook up sometimes when I was like 16 and he was 20, now we pretend we don't know each other, but he's cool. Ahhhh, such is life. All in all things are good by my standards. I should call my mom. OUCH."

"event","So I'm tired of everything. It is all so exhausting. I hate having to work at everything that everyone takes for granted. I want to talk about my mom and dad in here, but I can't yet. Something was said by someone today that got me thinking about them. Its a relief to finally be out. Damn rent hanging over my head. I don't want a lot of money, just maybe like $500 a month. A little more if I need food. I'll figure it out. I figured out the other problem. I hate the solution because I feel like I'm losing something that i never fully realized that I had, but its better this way. 
Shut it all off.
Be numb.
Survive.
But whats the point if you don't even have something to look foward to?"

"event","ive been so caught up with everything that i didnt realize that school is starting in about a month..august 10th is just around the corner...obviously ive been busy cause i dont even have the time to hang out with my friends...i miss you guys! well whats the lastest on me..neil was sick for a whole week..and it wasnt just a typical sickness of getting the cold and coughing. it was to the point where he was shivering. Since my grandpa is a witch doctor, i txtd my uncle in p.i. and ask him to tell my grandpa to tawas neil.and guess whats the results..i guess neil forgot to say excuse me somewhere and he mad the tatamona and some other spirit mad..and so they made him sick. I was there for him through the whole week. I bought him food at his house....kept him warm,made sure he took his medication, and made sure he didnt burn up by putting the face towel on his forehead. proved him wrong,but what touched me the most is when he said love thanks for taking care of me. my heart melted down..hehe!*(crosses fingers that we stay happy)*
anyway, i was saying..well he just got better yesterday and boy did he get skinny. all his bones are popping out. as long as we both stick together he'll get fat again. i know the brother wouldnt do anything..thats why i was the one there for him. but im not complaining, because we saw the different sides of us...and it felt good that i was the one that took care of him and not just staying home and not helping. 
work i can say is getting better..i can see myself in the bank for 5yrs on the long run..because despite my bitchy boss..everythings fine.the other day she was complaining about my hair that she didnt like how i tied it...she was blabbing about how im representing the bank and that i need to look good..but hello i was off that day so i have no one to impress just my damn co-workers. they didnt even seem to mind so why should she. i just looked at her and said ok..then left. gosh if you look at her, her hair is like a bush ready for the cherries to get picked out.
ay nako! thats the lastest on me.......pretty long entry again. well you know me...i always have a lot to say.heh!
Take it easy guys!"

gosh...i dont know, i wish i was just content staying home and just stop complaining. i think i should do that....just stay home and stop asking my other half lets go somewhere...."

we ended showing up at the import night...gee that was so boring...lyn was right it was a waste of a dollar...then we went to sharks..it was okay..like i said there nothing else to do on this freaking island...

today i stayed in bed and didnt want to move...everyone was home this morning but yet everyone was in bed also...my mom actually didnt cook anything so im left here at home with no food....i want to go out but then again my gas isnt enough for me to drive back home...

man i need a miracle to happen...yeah i said in my past journals that all my wishes had come true...well for some reason idk..everythings falling down the drain...i know that its just part of life to suffer...but i think this is enough already..i cant take it anymore..

im still not over the bench incident...yesterday when me and lyn actually went there.it was so hard for me to go in the store...its like i wanted to cry ...my heart felt so heavy...watching my fellow ex co-workers there and just missing the whole aroma of the store..then again the bitch was there....leah the manager who idk...have you ever a had that feeling that you know that you and that person wont get along no matter how hard you try to like that person..well thats the feeling i have towards leah..the minute they hired her i was like i dont like her...vice versa to her...she is so plastic to me..how pathetic ...

i pray eACH night that hopefully a miracle will happen and that things get back to normal so everyone can be happy...no that i dont have a job...my mom been on my case about my cel phone bill and my bill for my braces...plus my gas money...did i tell you that financial aide said i got a approve for fafsa but when i went there the other day...it was a false alarm..now im stuck with 2 thousand something to pay off...stupid dumb ass who gave me the wrong info..i told my mom about it and boy was she mad....i was too embarass to face her so i just cried...

i dont know my family is going to financial crisis right now...ive been looking for jobs lately and all i can say is that i just have to wait...and see what happens then...but i hope that this crisis that my family is going through will end...

each time i look at the mirror i tell myself..what happen..what happen to the maila that was hardworking...that was always on top of everything..i say that i am a failure but then other people tell me that its just a part of life to go through this trial...idk...i pray and i pray so hard that things will get better...

each time i share a laugh with lyn...it makes my problems go away..but only for a short period of time...thats why as much as possible i try to make myself busy because i dont want to think about it...then again...with situations like this..i just need to face it and deal with it........"

"event","hi peeps...here i am at home..super bored. i would go out but then there's no where to go. today is neil's birthday and i so want to spend time with him but he's relatives are bbqing for him. it sucks because i wanted to spend time together because this is his is 1st birthday that we would be spending together. i dont know if im just being selfish because im feeling this way..but i have rights also..i just want to spend time and make this day so memorable but i can't make it happen because he's busy. im being in-denial because i know me and neil are falling apart and i wont admit it. i dont even know why im waiting ...but im honestly trying my best to work things out but it seems like its not working. what should i do guys...anyone any advice you would give me. i know im just scared to see what would happen after we break up. idk. thanks!"

"event","oh gosh...its been so long since ive wrote in this thingy. anyway...gosh xmas just passed and it wasn't all that great. i mean yeah did the usual go to aunts and uncles' houses to eat and bless but afterwards...i had the whole night to myself. I didn't even get anything from them..i mean at least 5bucks to watch a movie or something but im just too old for that shit anyway. at times like this i wish i was a kid again. 
what else to say...love life...oh gosh its a roller coaster baby and i dont know when it'll ever be a smooth ride. ay nako (thats what neil always says)! anyway...i guess i just love the guy!(psh) haha!
recently it was dixie's birthday...and was good. i mean lots of people showed up and that was cool. two different groups combine..whoo good thing we're all just mature adults and put our grudges aside. 
i just recently heard that my other friend karen ejan is coming back this summer...o0o0 im so excited cause she was one of my good friends back in middle school. but sure as hell i know things have changed big time.but hey i still know where she lives haha..im such a stalker. so shermah is coming back..and karen...oh gosh i so wish my bestfriend cheska comes back and just surprise the heck out of me. hehe. thats too good to be true..

oh my gosh im just typing away...i gues alot of things are on my mind...and i just can't sleep yet...neil gave up..he's too sleepy to talk to me..so here i am in front of my computer typing away...not even knowing if i make any sense or what...haha. wow whoever's reading this is so probably thinking maila's so weird. yes i am..haha..thats why lots of people just love me. 

oh gosh new years is coming..and im thinking of what should my new year's resolution be...um...(thinking thinking thinking..) ill get back to that...but so much things are happening in JANUARY...its my cousin's wedding and its neil's 21st birthday...oh gosh how am i going to manage that...its like one day after the other...

oh man...help! haha! well i better stop before i just don't make any sense anymore. takes cares!"

"event","man...i dont know if i should be happy that im leaving or just feeling nothing.maybe im feeling this way because my so called bf seems to not care anymore.its so different now, since he came back from the p.i. hes been pushing me away. now its okay, if we don't spend time together and work is more important that spending time. i am having a difficult time, to the point where i don't know what to do. it sucks to be me right now, my heart is falling into pieces bit by bit and there's no way in putting it back together. i try so hard to spend time and be happy but he's not into it as much as i am. its like im the only one trying to work things out and he's just letting it be. i know we all have problems of our own that we need to deal with but i know that in a relationship we help each other out and not leave one behind. well im the one being left behind. i feel that he just with me because he doesn't want to break my heart but yet i dont want to assume that because i really really still care for him. i know deep inside we can work things out its just the matter of if he wants to also. no matter how much i try not to think about it, or thing negative things, i feel it. its one of those feelings that ive felt before with joey. this is the same exact signs that he showed me when he came back from p.i. maybe there's no third party involve but there is somethign wrong. he did say that while he was back there he was FREE. thats already a hint that he wants to break up with me. i need help....i really do, i can't help but break down. its not healthy for me or my studies. i told myself when i come back from p.i. and he still acts the same im gonna break it off. hopefully im strong enough to do it and just walk it off. it just sucks to be me right now!"

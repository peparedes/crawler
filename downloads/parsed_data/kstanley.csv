My birthday is coming up in a few weeks, and I am planning to have a couple of ""Come to Brooklyn"" weekends.  On Saturday, June 2, and Saturday, June 9, I am having all day parties for me and Gary's friends.  There will be food and booze and activities&mdash;maybe Park Slope haunted bar-hopping, maybe picnics in Prospect Park, maybe BAM or Brooklyn Botanic Garden visits.  I am still organizing everything.  If you are available and inclined on either date, drop me a line here or at my e-mail postman @ kimberlystanley.com.

An absolute good time is guaranteed."

"event","Chris said phenomenology is ""a method of healing the breech between mind and body.""  I've spent a lot of time thinking about this idea in researching my paper on bio-nanotechnology (nanobytes designed to go into the human body.)

In class, we've talked about how the world of computers is the world is world of logic and rationality; it facilitates the world of the mind.  Both Sally Pryor (Thinking of Oneself as a Computer) and McCullough refer to the tendency to get lost in the computer world; I'm sure all of us have had that experience of sitting in front of the computer for hours--usually at the expense of our bodies' needs (food, rest, going to the bathroom.)  

When we watched 2001, we saw what happened when humans got to a point where their bodies got in the way of advancement.  HAL could continue the mission without people; people seemed to be in the way on the spaceship Discovery because so much had to be done to keep them safe and in good health.  Machines aren't that fragile.  And it occurred to me while watching 2001, that at some point, if we want to keep advancing technologically, we going to have to enhance our physical bodies to handle rigors of our advancement.  

It seems to me that we have been shown two scenarios in the course of this class: machines becoming more like people (Mike, HAL) or people becoming more like machines (Alphaville).  But maybe the best thing to do is to neither.  Maybe the best thing to do would be to take from the machine world what is good and keep what is good about being human.  That's where bio-nanotechnology comes in.  

Bio-nanotechnology offers us the means to strengthen our physical bodies to meet the social and technological challenges that we all face.  Nanotechnology could help us to become aware of our bodies and their functions at a very precise level--giving a precise level of control over our bodies.  In some ways this sounds the usual masculine, rational view, but I think it could represent an embracing of the body at an unprecedented level.  I think it would be difficult to ignore your body if you are constantly being given information about it."

"event","Reading about the World's Fair display of the city of the future reminded me of our discussions of the masculine versus the feminine.  There's something very masculine about the design for the city of the future.  It images a world were roads are straight and buildings are designed just so, and everyone is moving without hinderance toward...whatever.  What this model lacks is soul or a sense of community; what is lacks the feminine.  And that's the problem with the city of the future as envisioned by the vendors participating in the World's Fair of 1939: their view of the future was this cold masculine view of unattainable perfection.

The same could be said of cyberspace.  We want to be certain that we aren't imposing some useless aesthetic paradigm on cyberspace that doesn't reflect or embrace its inhabitants.  Organic growth (managed to a certain extent) seems better than forcing an artificial and rigid structure."

"event","My journal entry is a bit late because I fell ill over break.  But as I was lying there, slightly feverish and stuffed up, I thought a lot about what it would be like if I was cyborg.

My schedule has become very full lately, and I have stretched myself too far; that's why I got sick.  The will is strong, but the flesh is weak, as my granny used to say.  My fever was the highest on the second day I was sick and I was miserable.  There's nothing like a fever to remind you how vulnerable you are.  It doesn't matter how strong your mind is if your body can't follow.  

How cool would it be if cybernetics got rid of illnesses like the common cold?  An implant in my arm could release nanobytes into my bloodstream which would fight off infection before it had a chance to get a hold of me.

I know that people are afraid of losing their humanity if they begin to ""enhance"" themselves with cybernetics.  But honestly, that doesn't bother me.  What is humanity anyway?  I'm sure each culture has their own answer.  Time has taught me that what I believe with total conviction today, I reject utterly tomorrow.  So why couldn't my definition of humanity change?

It ties into this whole idea that some people (or maybe everyone) seems to have that the past was better than the present.  But I think people are romanticizing things. I don't want to ever go back to a time with no toilet paper or women's rights.  I mean ugh!  And I'll tell you something else, if people from the past were dropped into our time, they would probably be equally amazed and horrified at what we've become.

The point I'm making is this: As we evolve as a society, the way we define ourselves evolves as well.  And that is something that we should keep in mind as we march into this cybernetic future.  It really doesn't matter how horrifying we might find cybernetic enhancement, what matters is how future generations regard it, and my guess is they are going think it's no big deal."

"event","The idea that struck me the most in Donna Haraway's piece was the idea of the feminization of our society.  She floated this idea that the work place (and society in general) was becoming feminized.  Not in the sense that women are given equal pay or true equal rights to men, but that all of our rights have eroded.  I think what she is saying is that rather than raising women's rights to that of men, that men's rights have been brought down to that of women's.

Now of course, this is not globally true, but there is something in what Haraway says here.  For example, the workplace has become feminized.  People do work more and they are paid less.  Furthermore, their work is not valued.  It's valued generically, but not specifically.  They are happy someone is managing this project, but they don't care that it's me.

This trend is the result of industrialization.  We are just cogs in a larger consumerism machine.  We are interchangeable and therefore, not important as individuals.  Ironically, we live in a culture that values individuality and pushes us to be independent and unique.  So where is this individuality supposed to manifest?  Not at work--where most of us spend most of our waking hours.  So where?  Sometimes, it seems to me that our only outlet for individuality is in what we buy.  But that's crazy--I don't want to express my individuality by buying shit."

"event","A few days ago, we talked about why dytopian stories are so popular--in particular, why do so many of these writers and artists seem so afraid not just of the future, but of the computerized future?

My first instinct is to say that they are afraid of something they don't understand.  You don't see a lot of computer people writing horror stories about computers ruining humanity, because computer people (as I am using the term here) like computers, and they don't see them as a threat.  But that's not a satisfactory explanation, because one could argue, that ""computer people"" are too close to computers to see what is really happening.  What I mean by that is, when you are close to something--when you like it, you make excuses for it, and you have a hard time seeing it objectively.

So I know it's important to hear these critical voices--voices that fear technology in some way.  Even if I think they are exaggerating the impact of technology or misunderstanding it, I realize that their view is important to consider when thinking about how technology affects all of us.

Last week, Maria and I were talking in <a href=""http://mariasthoughts.livejournal.com/1280.html"">her blog</a> and <a href=""http://kstanley.livejournal.com/171159.html"">mine</a> about this, and we were talking about how people's fear of technology was based on insecurity--insecurity about our place in a world of advanced technology.  The great advantage of technology is that does a lot of the work for us.  The great disadvantage of technology is that <em>it does a lot of the work for us!</em>  Right?  

I've experienced this positive/negative impact on a personal level.  My job is updating a web site.  A few years ago, the Web Technology Department came to me about upgrading our site.  They wanted to roll the site (which was handcoded) into a content management system.  Of course it was logical for a variety of reasons that I won't go into.  But what this meant was that my job changed: I would go from hand-coding HTML and CSS to using a graphical interface to update the sites I was responsible for.  What did this mean?  Well it meant that my company didn't need someone as technically knowledgeable as me to do the job.  Because the content management system was doing so much of the work, it meant that I lost a certain amount of control over how the sites worked.  I had a few months of vanity-driven discomfort; I started to dislike the new content management system, because it made me feel less relevant.

I think there is probably something about computers and their perfection and speed that makes people feel threatened, and I think that is why we see so many dytopsian computerized future stories."

"event","I watched Alphaville earlier today.  It made me think of our classroom conversation about The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and how I said that my problem with Mike was not that he was a machine, but that he had total power.

It seemed like Godard was trying to show that humans were superior to machines because humans feel emotions and think poetically while computers live in a world of rigid logic which limits their understanding of humans.

What struck me about the film (and my comments about Mike) was how the machine (the Alpha 60, I mean) was really incidental to the themes that Godard was exploring.  In fact, the emotion vs. logic argument is an old one--one that has been hashed and rehashed over and over through human history. 

I think technology has become the scapegoat for an internal conflict that has been present in all human society since the very beginning: Why are we here?  Where did we come from?  

AI disturbs us because on some level people think that if we can create an intelligent life form--one that is even better than us, what does that say about us and our role?  And what does it imply about the one who created us?"

"event","We were talking this week about the idea of the learning chip.  The way I understand it, the chip would be used to upload data such as books to the short-term memory center of the brain.  What happened to the knowledge after that would be up to your long term memory.
 
If such a thing was possible, I think it could represent a very practical way to learn certain things quickly.  For example, it would be great to be able to upload a language.  But what I wonder is, how quickly could you start to use that language?  And what activities would you need to perform in order to ensure that the data you uploaded on the chip was integrated into your memory?
 
If this sort of implant was effective, it would probably change the teaching and the technical writing industries.  We would have to focus on entirely new sets of usability rules.  Chip information would have to be designed so that it is easily absorbed by the brain.  I don't know how the brain stores memory, but it seems to me that information being uploaded directly to the brain would have to be organized differently&mdash;just like information presented in a book is organized differently than information presented in a video.  And what would that brain-friendly organization look like?"

"event","A few days ago in class, we had a discussion about journalism and blogging and how the Internet has created a new public Commons.

The professor pointed out that this idea of objective journalism is relatively new&mdash;a twentieth century invention.  Before, the news, which was spread mostly through newspapers, was biased.  You bought and read the paper that reflected your socio-political views, and that was okay.

I find myself very frustrated with ""objective"" news.  News is not objective.  What a media outlet chooses to report upon and what they choose to ignore reveals a lot about the viewpoint of that outlet.

Maybe the best thing to do would be to create a forum where people on all sides of the issue can have their say.  The Newshour with Jim Lehrer and Now are two news programs (on PBS) that practice this type of reporting, and I think it's very effective.

For example, as I was watching tonight, there was a story on irradiating produce.  Both pro-irradiation and anti-irradiation supporters were given equal voice.  I'm against irradiated food, but the advocates were very convincing, and as a result of this report, I am willing to hear more about the potential benefits of irradiation.

I'd love to believe that the Internet and blogs are offering similarly balanced newsfeeds, but so far, I haven't seen that.  Most of the blogs that I frequent are biased toward one side of the political spectrum or the other."

I was trying to explain the intricacies of ""Katy, bar the door,"" when I realized that I couldn't.  Every definition that I came up with either used another expression (""Lock the door!"", ""Watch out!, ""Heads up!"") or sounded idiotic (""...like when a surprise is coming and someone wants you to be ready, or when something a little too exciting is going on....)

I had a similar break-down once when I was trying to explain to someone the expression: ""Well, he'd better come to Jesus pretty damn quick.""

"event","Hey folks, 
 
I'm taking a new class this semester called Computers, Technology, and Values.  My professor has asked us to write in our blogs (and each other's blogs) about some of the reading we are doing.
 
I wonder if any of you have read <a href=""http://brighton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/prajlich/forster.html"" target=""_blank""><em>The Machine Stops</em></a> by E.M. Forester?  It's not that long of a story.
 
It's dystopian view of the future in which everyone stays in a single room and only communicates through the computer.  Obviously, it sounds very familiar.  The story raises a lot of questions about how our frequent use of computers is changing us.  One theme that runs throughout the story is the danger of disengaging from other people and from the world in general.  In <em>Machine</em>, the people spend all of their time in their rooms pursuing intellectual interests (art, music, literature, science.)  It reminds me of another story, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Glass-Bead-Game-Magister-Novel/dp/0312278497/sr=8-1/qid=1170261920/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7383739-5430532?ie=UTF8&s=books"" target=""_blank""><em>The Glass Bead Game</em></a>, by Herman Hesse.  In that story, the world's intellectuals shut themselves away in an academy and ignore the world around them, which is tearing itself apart.
 
After reading <em>The Glass Bead Game</em>, I started to feel more of an obligation to remain in the world, I mean to keep up with important current events and to participate in things.  <em>Machine</em> reminded me of this.  I do not want to allow myself to become entranced by the constant stream of information and entertainment that parades before my eyes.  Because whether you are pursuing something intellectual or something trivial, if you are doing it at the expense of the world, then you are walking a dangerous path.
 
We also read another piece for class, <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush"" target=""_blank"">""As We Think""</a> by Vannevar Bush.  It was written by a scientist after WWII, and it seems to foresee the invention of the internet.  In this essay, Bush is pondering the ideal personal information gathering and storing tool.  
 
When I read both these pieces&mdash;Forester and Bush&mdash;I couldn't help but think about what it would take to create and maintain the systems they describe.  Think about when you get a new computer: you have to set everything up to get the computer operating at maximum efficiency.  It can be a lot of work. 

Here's another example:  I just started using Google Desktop.  One of its features is a search for your hard drive.  It's great; it searches all your files, even your e-mails, for whatever keyword that you put in.  It's a great way to sift through years of documentation.  The only problem is, it can't search my thousands of images.  And the reason is that I haven't labeled the images very well, and so Google doesn't know what they are.  In order to fully use Google's functionality, I would have to label thousands of images, and that isn't going to happen.
 
So that's what I think about when I read stories that talk about super-computers that run our lives.  What about the set-up? Hell, what about the maintenance?  I can't see a future where people are controlled by machines, because I can't see a future where we all embrace the organization and tidiness of mindset required to make the machines powerful enough to control us."

"event","Look, I'm not trying to be rude or offend anybody, but there are some Christmas songs that just don't make a lot of sense to me.  I wonder how they could have possibly become popular.

For example, <strong><em>The Little Drummer Boy</em></strong>.  Here's a song that revolves around some kid playing a drum for Jesus.  That's exactly what it's about.  And it's supposed to be all holy, but he's DRUMMING FOR JESUS--who is a baby by the way.  Think Mary and Joseph appreciated that?  Because if there is one thing a woman who has just gone through labor enjoys, is some little punk beating a drum around her and the baby.  The song says that the baby Jesus smilled at the little drummer boy, but my guess is the ""smile"" was actually baby Jesus screaming in fright.  I'm pretty sure the little drummer boy went to Hell.

Another song, that gives me pause is <strong><em>We Wish You a Merry Christmas</em></strong>.  I don't know what figgy pudding is, but I do know that if anyone spoke to me like that, they would never get any figgy pudding, not now, not right here.  And you can go ahead stay there all day, because I am not going to bring you any fucking figgy pudding until you learn to ask nicely.

Now let's talk about <em><strong>The Twelve Days of Christmas</strong></em>.  I liked this song as a kid, because it was fun to remember all the gifts, and I got a kick out of the whole ""five golden rings"" thing.  But now, I can't help but wonder, where in the hell does the gift receipient put all of those things? Here's the gift list: 
12 partridges in pear trees
22 turtle doves
30 French hens
36 birds-a-calling
40 golden rings
42 geese-a-laying
42 swans-a-swimming
40 maids-a-milking
36 ladies dancing
30 lords-a-leaping
22 pipers piping
12 drummers drumming.

Okay so the golden rings wouldn't be a problem, but the other stuff would.  None of it is anything I would want, much less need (""Gee, and I had just run out of lords-a-leaping--Thanks!""), and all that poultry seems downright unsanitary.  And what do you do with all those people?  Because my guess is that the gift receipient didn't have an extra 140 bedrooms for milk maids and pipers.  And what do partridges eat?  Is that what the pear tree is for?  

Another song that bothers me is <em><strong>Frosty the Snowman</strong></em>.  First of all, why is this a Christmas song? Second of all, why is such a depressing song so upbeat?  Newsflash: Frosty dies at the end.  He melts.  And don't give me that shit about him coming back the next time it snows.  What if there is no snow next year or ever again?  Global warming Y'all.  

But I don't want anyone to think that this means I don't like Christmas music.  I do.  In fact here are a few Christmas album recommendations:

<strong>The Carpenters <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Portrait-Carpenters/dp/samples/B000002GHQ/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/102-7383739-5430532#disc_1"" target=""_blank"">Christmas Portrait</a></em></strong>.  <em>Merry Christmas Darling</em> sung by Karen Carpenter is about as good as it gets.  There is only one Christmas song I like as well, and that is <em>Blue Christmas</em> by Elvis, which you can find on any Elvis Christmas album (yes, there are several), but my favorite is <strong><em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Was-Like-Christmas/dp/B000002WR7/sr=1-1/qid=1166752152/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7383739-5430532?ie=UTF8&s=music"" target=""_blank"">If Everyday Was Like Christmas</a></em></strong>.  Another one I love, and don't laugh, is the Chipmunks Christmas album, <strong><em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2P86/ref=wl_it_dp/102-7383739-5430532?ie=UTF8&coliid=I3N0ET692Q69R&colid=1UQUZDL4WZ2WG"" target=""_blank"">Christmas With the Chipmunks</a></em></strong>.  I know it's dumb, but this was the first album I bought for myself as a child (on 8-track), and listening to it brings back happy memories."

 target=""_blank"">this</a>?  Because I really want it and I need a new leather jacket and this one will last me a long time, and it will look good.  Am I so wrong?

Okay here's my list of shows:

<strong><em><a href=""http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/"" target=""_blank"">Deadwood</a></em></strong>:
I watch this more out of habit than anything else.  I tuned in from the beginning and since it's only running one more season (and I think it might be a half season at that), I figure I can see it out.  Basically it just got too soap-opera-y.  I dunno, it's a good show, but I got sort of tired of it.

<strong><em><a href=""http://www.scifi.com/doctorwho/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Who</a></em></strong>:
Yes this is my favorite new show.  And guess what?  The second season start on Sci-Fi in September.  I was never a hardcore DW fan (see my father for that), but I watched the show now and then growing up.  But the thing is, the new version is a lot of fun and I like it quite a bit.  Plus, the show has genuine moments of creepiness--rather than that trying-too-hard, <em>Silent Hill</em> way.  


<strong><em><a href=""http://www.scifi.com/eureka/"" target=""_blank"">Eureka</a></em></strong>:
This is such a happy, family show! Everything is resolved at the end of the episode--you know that nothing really bad is going to happen and you don't spend a lot of time worrying about the characters or what is going to happen to them.  This is a fun show that you will never lose sleep over and that Sheriff Carter is cute!

<strong><em><a href=""http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/"" target=""_blank"">Battlestar Galactica</a></em></strong>:
Obviously, this is best show I have seen in a long time.  I put up it there with my all time favorites--Twin Peaks, X-Files, Buffy, Carnivale, etc.  I'm a little frightened of the upcoming season, but with a little hand-holding, I am sure I can make it through.

<strong><em><a href=""http://hustle.amctv.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hustle</a></em></strong>:
Love! LOVE! LOVE this show.  It's like a continuous, episodic version of Ocean's Twelve, but with British people.

<strong><em><a href=""http://www.hbo.com/entourage/"" target=""_blank"">Entourage</a></em></strong>:
Yeah I still watch it and I still enjoy it.  Part of it might be because I lived in LA for a several years and I know that the show is realistic (no matter how outrageous it is), and part of it surely is because it's just fun to see what these four young guys do with all this wealth and fame. It walks that line between being serious and being light--what do they call it?  A dramedy?  Originally I wished this show was longer, but half an hour is the perfect length for a show like this.

<strong><em><a href=""http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/drama_mysteries/life_on_mars/life_on_mars.jsp"" target=""_blank"">Life on Mars</a></em></strong>:
Okay I'll admit it.  A large part of the appeal of this show is nostalgia.  Even though it's British, it really captures that 70s cop show style--the car chases, the fighting style...it's really fun to watch. And I love the music and clothes. I have a real fondness for the early 70s because that was when I first became conscious (I was born in 1969).  <lj user=""fleegull""> was telling me that David E. Kelley bought the rights to do an American version.  I'm not sure that it's necessary, but if they do do it, then I hope they set it in 1977 in SoCal and make the cops California Highway Patrol...Duh, Duh, Duh-Duh, Duh!  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about!

I have a feeling that there are more shows, but I can't think of them.  I'll do another entry if I remember."

<lj-cut>
Sam's obviously in a coma--we keep hearing the machines and voices of doctor's and family.  But is he really traveling back in time?  I don't know how time travel works--maybe everyone in a coma travels back and forth in time.

And more importantly, why 1973?  It can't just be because of the song that was playing during his accident.  Something must have happened to him in 1973 to make it such an important year--one that he needs to return to.

And who is the best character?  By the third episode, I had already decided that it was DCI Hunt.  I'm doomed to forever like the bad ones.

So what are the good new series coming up this fall?  I am totally out of the loop.  The only thing I am remotely interested in is the new Alan Ball vampire project, which is a year away."

"event","I decided to watch <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365485/"" target=""_blank"">The Matador</a></em> and pretend that Pierce Brosnan's character Julian was really Remington Steele.  You know--gone to seed.  It was a good movie anyway, but the Remington Steele thing really enhanced my enjoyment of the whole thing.

I was big <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083470/"" target=""_blank"">Remington Steele</a></em> fan&#151;while my friends were watching <em><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088571/"" target=""_blank"">Moonlighting</a></em>, I was watching <em>Remington Steele</em>.  

I had a hardcore crush on Remington Steele&#151;it came on at 9pm on Tuesdays.  Hmmm and that's the time BtVS came on too...coincidence?  I think not.  My mother used to tease me saying that I always wore my ""special nightgown"" when watching RS.  Okay it's true.  What can do you?  SoaP&#151;I really did have a thing for him.  

I have a recommendation.  What with all this style stuff (<em>What Not to Wear</em>, etc.) that I have been getting into, I have bought a couple of books on style.  The best one, the one I recommend for all of you gals is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592400418/sr=8-6/qid=1155940394/ref=pd_bbs_6/104-4948384-9464767?ie=UTF8"" target=""_blank""><em>The Pocket Stylist</em></a>.  It's really straight-forward, info-rich guide to what works for your body.  There are a lot of books out there on this sort of thing, but this is the best I've found.  It goes through all the usual stuff on what looks good on your body-type, but it also goes into more detail.  There's a whole chapter on tailoring&#151;almost no one&#151;even models, can wear clothes off the rack.  All of us need a degree of tailoring.  It's a good book. 

I finally go the rest of my living room furniture, so if anyone wants to sit on my new furniture and have cocktails, just let me know."

"event","Who says that you have to wait till January 1st for annual resolutions?!  You can make resolutions any damn time you feel like it.

My August 11th Resolutions.

1) Stop watching Ocean's Twelve.
Seriously...STOP WATCHING IT.  And stop telling everyone, ""you know, it was actually pretty good...""  And stop listening to the soundtrack.  There are other movies and other soundtracks...really.

2) Stop making jam.  Yes, I know it seemed like a fun project earlier this Summer when things were slow at work and you were drinking too much vodka, but twenty jars of plum jam?  Enough, I think.

3) Buy a pinstrip suit.  And don't buy it online. Just get your fucking ass down to Macy's Brooklyn and try on shit.  The UPS man is getting tired of seeing your ass returing stuff from Bluefly that didn't fit like it looked in the picture.

4) Stop eating those damn maltballs!  How many do you think you eat in a day?  Seriously?  You aren't eight years old--do you honestly think that you can eat crap like this and not suffer the consequences?

5) Do that bellydancing routine that's available On Demand.  It was fun--albeit tiring and not as tricky as you thought.

6) Brush the dogs' teeth.  No, they don't like it, but tough.  The vet said you had to brush their teeth twice a week--don't be an asshole--just do it.

7) Finish getting Electra potty-trained.  She's nearly seven months old and still peeing ""next"" to the Wee-wee pad rather than on it.  Just make the effort and pay attention and correct her when she does the wrong thing.  It's all up to you and you only.

8) Try to do more stuff with your friends...it's not like you live in Antartica and can't see anyone.  Make the effort.

9) Starting posting on Live Journal more--the more you write, the better."

"event","Okay, now I know I've talked about my favorite movie.  Publicly, my favorite films include Dazed and Confused, Lone Star, and Velvet Goldmine.  But there is another film that I adore--that I can watch any time, any where from start to finish and that film is Cousins.  Yes, yes--the Joel Schumacher, 1989 film. It's true.  It is one of my very favorites.

I'm not sure what it is about it--part of my enjoyment of the film stems from the fact that although I don't find Ted Danson or Isabella Rosellini particularly attractive, some how...some magic way, I get caught up in their love story.

Normally, I don't condone affairs--I mean married people having affairs--and this film revolves around this--but somehow it works here and I don't find it offensive.  The ""wronged"" spouses aren't caricatures--they seem like real, fairly decent people--just the wrong people, if you KWIM.

I have a couple of other non-movie recommendations.  I got a book a few weeks ago called, ""The Pocket Stylist"" (by Kendall Farr). It's probably the best, most practical book I have ever seen on how to buy clothes for your body type and how to care for them.  I recommend it very, very highly.

My other recommendation is booze-related.  Fresh Direct sells a red sparkling wine from Australia called Lorikeet Shiraz. It's utterly drinkable-and I am not a red wine drinker.

I hope everything is going well for everyone and that all of you are enjoying your summer, (or winter as the case may be)."

"event","I would love to say that during this LJ hiatus that I have been doing something exciting like having endless sex with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers in Paris or painting masterpieces in the Seychelles or making the world a better place, but the truth is I have been spending a lot of time watching Cash in the Attic and bad Japanese horror movies whilst drinking vodka and/or champagne cocktails.  But a couple of things have happened...

First however, I want to say something: this has to be the worst allergy season I have ever experienced.  My whole sinus-throat-eye triumvate (or whatever these doctor people call it) has been in total uproar for weeks.  I am constantly itching--eyes, throat, skin.  I am slamming two Benedryl a day and if you don't think that's serious, you just don't know allergy medicine.  Plus I am supplementing with Claritin.  I don't even know why I bother with it though--my allergies laugh vampircally at Claritin.  ""Hah! Hah! Hah!"" it says, ""As if that THAT puny little drug will stop me!  Glorious itchy, sneezing, stuffy me!  Mu-hah hah!""

But other than that, everything has been fine.  The biggest news is that we got another dog.  Yessiree Bob, another one.  A fiend, (I meant friend of course), for Theodore to play with.  Her name is Electra and she barks Satanically every time I leave the room.  And I have to leave sometimes to pee and to go to the store and stuff like that.  Lordy, she is annoying.  Hopefully this is a horrible phase that she will pass through.  Otherwise it is straight to the electric collar for you Electra!  Do you hear me?  Mommy will put the electric collar on you!  <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/gmark/PhotoAlbum22.html"" target=""_blank"">Anyway, here are some pictures of her.</a>
 

Now listen, my birthday is coming up again soon.  June 4th.  So I was thinking that I would host a haunted pub crawl for my birthday.  We would do it on Saturday, June 3rd of course.  So if you are interested in participating, let me know. Of course I wanted to do the Theodore Roosevelt pub crawl, but they don't offer that--and TR wasn't much of a drinker any way.

My other news is that I am going to transfer out of NYU.  Yes, we've had some good times, but we have really grown apart in the last year and I have found a hot new school, that offers the degree in technical communication I want.  Her name is Brooklyn Polytech and I think we are going to be a really good match.

Oh and Gary changed jobs.  He left NBC for a company called Lime, which is a cable/internet start up. He's very happy, so I am happy for him.  Plus his boss at NBC was a dick.  And everyone who works for the guy thinks so.  In fact Gary's entire department at NBC is hemorrhaging people like a mofo: everyone is leaving because no one wants to work with this jackweed.  So that just goes to show you.

I guess that's about it for me. I hope all of you are doing well."

"event","Thank goodness the strike is finally over.  It's amazing just how much we NYCers rely upon public transit.  

I have this amazing ability to get sick, which I have demonstrated yet again.  I've been so stressed the last few weeks wrapping up my semester and planning for Christmas, that I have driven myself sick.  I also went out of town to visit my Texas family this last weekend.  I had to leave Theodore with my in-laws.  They are nice and I know he had a good time, but I missed him terribly.  Honestly I thought I was going to cry a couple of times.  How big of a baby am I?

Anyway, it's all done now: semester over, presents wrapped.  I'm just going to ignore this cold.  Actually I've been slamming Airborne every three hours and I think it might be working, but let's keep that to ourselves shall we?  I don't want my immune system to get overly cocky.

So I went back to Texas this last weekend.  We actually went to Tyler, Texas, which is a small town about a 100 miles south of Dallas.  My grandmother lives outside of Tyler along a small highway.  There are many houses like hers--dotting the highway, separated from their neighbors by acres of land.  It's a pretty typical Texas scene: a lot of my growing up was spent in rural areas like this--although I also spent time in Dallas and Houston.  My Father's side of the family definitely prefers rural to urban.  I guess that is one of the things that makes me different from them, although I have to admit, when I dream, I dream of open spaces, not tall buildings and honking horns.  And I do (secretly) find NYC to be overwhelming sometimes and when that happens I retreat into my apartment for days and don't go out (except to take Theodore to the Park).  So maybe I am more of a rural person than I want to admit.

So Gary and I went to Texas for Stanley Christmas.  Stanley Christmas is a party that my Dad's father and his wife held every year the weekend before Christmas.  All of the Stanleys and relatives come.  It's a big potluck dinner/smorgasbord of sweets.  All the kids get presents from everyone and the adults each get one gift.  Unbeknownst to me, over the last few years, the grown-ups have started doing something they call ""Chinese Christmas.""  

The way it works is this: each person brings a wrapped present; that way there is a present for everyone.  Everyone takes a number (if there are 21 people, there are 21 numbers).  Then, as each number is called in order, the person picks a present and opens it.  The next person called can either pick another present, or steal an opened present from someone else.  It goes on and on until everyone has been called and all the presents opened.  Why is it called ""Chinese"" Christmas?  I have no idea.  Anyway, I got some bath soap and Gary got a tin of chocolate cookies.

Here's what I like about being back in Texas: I opened the refrigerator at my grandmother's house and saw three cases of Diet Dr Pepper.  And do you know why?  Because EVERYONE drinks it!  Furthermore, when we went out for Mexican food, (another thing I like about Texas), I was able to order Diet Dr Pepper with my meal!!!  Do you fucking hear me?  Diet Dr Pepper with my meal?  And do you know why?  Because in Texas, EVERYONE drinks Dr Pepper.  

Another thing I noticed being around so many members of my family that I hadn't seen in ten years: we are really similar.  I might look my mother, but my personality is more like my father's and his family.  So to sit in a room with a group of people who think like you and who talk like you and who think the same things are funny, well, it's nice.  It makes you feel like you are alright.  I didn't realize how much I missed being around people like me.  Not that Gary is alien or anything, but these are the people who raised me and who I grew up with.  They left their mark on me.  I was surprised at how easy it was to fall into conversation with them--no awkwardness despite all the years we had been apart.  I fit right in--like hand in glove.

So I had a nice time.  Maybe we can hit the party again next year.

Listen I hope everyone has a happy holiday (whatever you are celebrating), and  good new year. My tip is to make yourself some attainable resolutions alongside the difficult ones, so at least you feel like you have accomplished something."

Theodore has this little faceless doll which looks sort of like a fuzzy gingerbread man; we call it ""Ginger.""  Anyway, I was running a bath this morning before going to work.  I was knifing around doing pre-work stuff.  After several minutes I went back into the bathroom to shut the water off and I found Theodore and Ginger in the tub. They looked as guilty as a small dog and a faceless stuffed animal can look.  I'm not sure exactly what happened--perhaps Theodore thought Ginger needed a bath or maybe he accidentally dropped her in the tub and was on a rescue mission--I really have no idea.

If anyone has any tips for drying out a stuffed animal without using a dryer, let me know; Theodore doesn't understand why I won't let him play with soaking-wet Ginger."

"event","Here's reason #52 on why I like Diet Dr Pepper better than other sodas: it doesn't go flat.  Well okay, it does go flat eventually, but it takes hours. Diet Coke goes flat in about 20 minutes (trust me I've timed it); how annoying is that?  You pour yourself a Coke and you do some work and some minutes later you take a swig and it's flat.  That's just stupid and there's no excuse for it.

Theodore's got a new thing: he sleeps in the bathtub.  Shit, I didn't even know he could get into the bathtub, much less sleep there, but I found him snoozing there a few days ago when I went in to pee.  I guess he likes it because the porcelain feels cool.  

We got our first snow on Sunday and so I made Theodore put on his snowsuit and boots before going to the Park; he was very sulky about the whole thing until he saw the snow, and then he was just beside himself in excitement.  He ran and ran and flopped around and he keeping looking at me and smiling with his mouth open--like he was saying, ""Boy oh boy Mommy!  This is boffo!""

We had to go in early though, because the snow clumped on Theodore's long hair and he was carrying around twice his weight in snow.  But he liked it very, very much.

Gary has started us watching this new animated show, Boondocks.  Are you any of you watching this?  As white person it's pretty uncomfortable to watch--a lot of black stereotypes are trotted out onscreen every week.

Listen, after reading that Jean Kilborne book in advertisements, I just can't stop noticing how stupid all the ads are.  I mean I noticed before, but now I really notice.  The one pissing me off right now is for the Samsung video camera.  It's about this guy who videotapes his superiors doing compromising things at an office party and then uses the footage to blackmail them into giving him a promotion.  The message: Use our our product and you can blackmail people into giving you what you apparently can't obtain through legal and ethical means.  Nice Canon, really nice.  It's bad enough hearing all these stories about creepy guys using their camera phones to take covert photos up women's dresses and how there are more and more video cameras in public places and no one has any expectation to privacy whatsoever.  Way to turn a negative into a selfish and immoral positive Samsung.  Way to go.

I've been going a little crazy with the Christmas shopping in the last week or so.  Citibank froze my credit card because I was making so many charges in rapid succession. They did the same thing on my honeymoon and it really pisses me off because my card was being declined.  I guess they didn't like all those St. Bart's charges.  Anyway, tonight I had to call them and EXPLAIN that they were not to freeze my card without consulting me first.  The customer service person wanted to go through each of the charges in question with me.  So I pulled up my cc acct online.  The guy was impatient telling me that I needed to look up the charges and call back.  Oh I'm sorry, do you have something else to do Motherfucker?  Don't let me attempting to resolve my account issues so I can continue to have a Merry Goddam Christmas get in your way--I don't want to cramp your Citibank customer service style.  

I really shouldn't have cocktails before I make these customer service calls--it never works out.

I saw that the NY Post had an article on Howard Dean this morning saying that Dean was a coward for saying that we couldn't win in Iraq.  Yeah, like sending other people's kids to die on your behalf is courageous.  What the fuck ever.

Say is anyone in NYC going to see the Narnia movie?  Because I want to see it and it would be fun to see it with other Narnia fans.

"event","It's amazing how cranky lack of sleep can make you and when I say *you*, of course I mean me.  Both Gary and Theodore were snoring to beat the band last night.  I thought was going to have to sleep on the couch.  

And then this morning when I took Theodore to the Park, some lady asked me about Theodore's name.  She asked why I named him after Theodore rather than the ""other Roosevelt.""  I explained that TR was my favorite pres, and she wanted to know why.  She said, ""Wasn't he a war monger and some sort of he-man hunter?""

You know how they have those scenes in movies where the music is playing and everyone is dancing and then Ben Stiller says something stupid and the music comes screeching to a halt and everyone turns and starts staring at him in horror?  Well that's sort of what happened. Of course technically, there was no music, no dancing, and no other people, but believe me, it was just like that.  For a split second, I almost pitied her, but only for a split second.

After five minutes of my ""explanation,"" (and I was only gotten to TR's years as Police Commissioner), she started to back away saying that she needed to keep an eye on her dog.  But I followed her saying, ""But there's more...there's more.""  In fact I followed her and her dog through the entire Park, saying things like, ""and he was the first President to really stand up to Corporate America, and he sued the Northern Securities company and forced J.P. Morgan to take his toys and go home...""  She kept nodding and saying, ""Oh.  Hmmm."" and looking around, (for help I guess), ""And then he passed the first version of the pure food and drug act and the meat inspection act, and he sided with coal miners in the Pennsylvania strike of 1902--the first President to side with labor in a strike, and he created the Dept. of Labor and Commerce..."" 

After 10 minutes she was saying things like, ""Well I have to go now...nice talking to you,"" and STILL I wouldn't stop, ""...and he put 230 million acres under Federal protection, (the equivalent of all Eastern states from Maine to Florida), and he did it under the noses of Corporate America who had successfully pushed a bill through Congress in an unsuccessful attempt to stop Roosevelt from putting any more land under Federal protection...and he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for negociating the treaty between Japan and Russia, thereby staving off WWI for nearly ten years...""

Anyway I think she got the idea.  I didn't even get to explain to her about the Panama Canal and how he wrote 35+ books (TR actually made a living by writing about nature, history, and the military; until he became Governor of NY, his political jobs didn't pay shit).  And I only barely got to say anything about the whole Bull Moose/getting shot in the chest and making a speech anyway thing and how TR didn't cheat on his wife (unlike OTHER President Roosevelts), and how in fact, TR was the one who went to Europe and drug Eleanor's sorry-ass, drunken, whoring father back home to his wife and child--and how he practically raised Eleanor since her parents were both insane and how a lot of who Eleanor was stemmed from being around TR.  I mean if we want to start comparing President Roosevelts I can go there, because after TR, the President I know the most about is FDR, (Mom is a huge fan of his and so I grew up with that).  But I guess this lady didn't want to hear about all that, because she left.  Hopefully she learned something from all this, which is DON'T FUCK WITH THEODORE ROOSEVELT IN MY PRESENCE&#151;EVER.

Yes, it's official, I am the crazy Theodore Roosevelt lady of Park Slope.  May my fame be spread far and wide."

"event","Well I have finally been able to start watching <i>Lost</i>.  Netflix took pity and sent me the first two discs of the first season, so Gary and I have gotten through the first eight episodes.  It's very entertaining, although I have realized that I hate musical montages and I don't know how I am ever going to catch up to the second season.  Have they started rerunning them yet?  Should I start recording?

Okay so Theodore (a.k.a The Best Dog In All The Land) did something really good the other day.  The Park is very pretty these days&#151;the leaves have all colored and have fallen down in cushy heaps.  Theodore is really attracted to the leaves and like to snuffle and scamper through them.  So this particular morning, we were on a hillside along the edge of the Long Meadow; that's where the treeline is.  We had met our neighbor K earlier and she and I were talking and playing with her baby while Theodore and her dog Ulysses were playing together in the leaves.  I noticed that Theodore was nosing up something.  He came trotting over with something in his mouth and guess what it was?  A $5 bill!  Good dog!  Now if I could just get him to do this on a regular basis, Gary and I could quit our jobs.

I had an interesting classroom discussion a couple of days ago.  I was in my organizational behavior class and were talking about why face to face talking is so superior to communicating via writing.  Naturally, I said that I didn't think it was *so* superior.  The teacher then explained that since you can't get your tone across that it is easy to for one person to misunderstand another in print.

Now she is not wrong&#151;we've all seen those posts where people say one thing and it is taken the wrong way and no one bothers to get clarification. But that happens in face to face communication too.  And consider how many posts you have written and how many you have read&#151;do these misunderstandings really happen that often?  And when they do, aren't the same people ALWAYS involved&#151;God love their little, drama-queen hearts?  The point I am making is that the more I write, the less misunderstandings I have to deal with.  Partly it is because writing slows me down and forces me to think about what I am going to say.  Those of you who have talked to me in person know that I speak very quickly.  And frequently people misunderstand what I say and what I mean.  I find this happens less when I am writing.  And the other part is that the more I communicate in this medium, the better I get at it&#151;it's just like anything.

Anyway, I tried to explain how we convey tone in our posts (the caps, the links, the formatting, the liberal use of HTML tags&#151;[grin]like this[/g], etc.)  And naturally most of the class disagreed with me and we got back on that spiel about how communicating via the Internet isn't as good as communicating in person and how face to face relationships are superior to online ones, blah, blah.  Honestly, I get SO sick of having this argument with people&#151;people who admit that they never participate in Internet community and they  [hairflip]""just like&#151;don't get it y'know?"".  Yeah I know.  Well how about this Sparky: come back to me after you have actually participated in an Internet community for a few years and then lecture me on how it is an inferior form of communicating and isn't ""real"".  I mean geez! When I studied anthropology, one of the first things the professor taught us was that it was important to avoid <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ethnocentrism"" target=_blank"">ethnocentrism</a>. I'm using the term liberally, but I don't see much difference between a non-community person lecturing me on how Internet community is inferior to non-Internet community, and me lecturing an Australian on how inferior Australia is to America.   

While it is true that we online community people don't technically represent another ethnic group, I'm beginning to think that we are just as different.  See I think that people who subject their thoughts and feeling to the discipline of writing are just different than people who don't.  I'm not saying that we are smarter, but I would say that most of us know ourselves and our own thoughts and feelings better than people who don't write on a regular basis.  And what we have in our communities is beyond mere writing, because it is also interactive.  I was reading <a href=""http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html#content"" target=""_blank"">a Rebecca Blood entry</A> a while back where she was talking about this.  And she said, 

<i>Shortly after I began producing Rebecca's Pocket I noticed two side effects I had not expected. First, I discovered my own interests. I thought I knew what I was interested in, but after linking stories for a few months I could see that I was much more interested in science, archaeology, and issues of injustice than I had realized. More importantly, I began to value more highly my own point of view. In composing my link text every day I carefully considered my own opinions and ideas, and I began to feel that my perspective was unique and important.

This profound experience may be most purely realized in the blog-style weblog. Lacking a focus on the outside world, the blogger is compelled to share his world with whomever is reading. He may engage other bloggers in conversation about the interests they share. He may reflect on a book he is reading, or the behavior of someone on the bus. He might describe a flower that he saw growing between the cracks of a sidewalk on his way to work. Or he may simply jot notes about his life: what work is like, what he had for dinner, what he thought of a recent movie. These fragments, pieced together over months, can provide an unexpectedly intimate view of what it is to be a particular individual in a particular place at a particular time.

The blogger, by virtue of simply writing down whatever is on his mind, will be confronted with his own thoughts and opinions. Blogging every day, he will become a more confident writer. A community of 100 or 20 or 3 people may spring up around the public record of his thoughts. Being met with friendly voices, he may gain more confidence in his view of the world; he may begin to experiment with longer forms of writing, to play with haiku, or to begin a creative project&#151;one that he would have dismissed as being inconsequential or doubted he could complete only a few months before.

As he enunciates his opinions daily, this new awareness of his inner life may develop into a trust in his own perspective. His own reactions&#151;to a poem, to other people, and, yes, to the media--will carry more weight with him. Accustomed to expressing his thoughts on his website, he will be able to more fully articulate his opinions to himself and others. He will become impatient with waiting to see what others think before he decides, and will begin to act in accordance with his inner voice instead. Ideally, he will become less reflexive and more reflective, and find his own opinions and ideas worthy of serious consideration.</i>

See that's it exactly.  This is how writing in a community transforms you.

If it hadn't been for these communities, I would never know what it was like to have someone truly like me for ME&#151;who I really am&#151;not what I look like or where I live or how much money I have or who I know, etc.  I don't want to imply that I think that our communities are utopian&#151;free of the problems associated with other communities&#151;we all know THAT'S not true.  But I certainly do not think our writing communities are inferior to the talking ones.

So...what is every-vun doin-k for Thanksgiving?  I am going to a restaurant like I do every year lately.  There is no one up here that actually wants to fix Thanksgiving dinner.  We always go to <a href=""http://www.riverviewny.com/"" target=_blank"">Riverview</a>, which is in LIC.  It's nice and all, but there is something <i>wrong</i> about brussel sprouts for Thanksgiving.  Plus Gary's family always has some sort of steak, which <i>clearly</i> is cheating.  

Last year I fixed a mini-T-day dinner for Gary and I the Friday after Thanksgiving, but I don't know if I am up to that this year; I have to finish my final papers early this year since I am going to Dallas the weekend before Christmas.  So I have to spend this next week, (which I have taken off), doing school work.  

However, I can certainly squeeze in a Harry Potter screening.  What is everyone in NYC doing vis-a-vis Harry Potter vs. the 2 Hot Guys?  Let me know, because I will surely want to tag along with one of you."

"event","Do you ever have have something that you intend to do, and you think, ""Oh I am going to do that tomorrow,"" and then tomorrow comes and you are busy and so you say, ""well maybe I will do it in a couple of days, or next week when things settle down...""  Well that's what has been happening with me and Live Journal.  I have gotten so engrossed in school and related matters that I have kept putting my posts off until one day I looked up and realized it had been months since I had posted.  So let's remedy that now.

I haven't been doing anything all that exciting--just going to school and playing with Theodore.  I have some <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/gmark/PhotoAlbum18.html"">new pictures of him</a> playing with the dog next door (Ulysses).  There are also some shots Gary took tonight of Theodore playing with one of his toys (he doesn't normally look so fluffy, he just went to the groomer's yesterday).

I have to talk about this really interesting book that I am reading for my pop culture class.  It is called <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684866005/qid=1131241808/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-5979226-3204045?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel</i></a>.  Like a lot of people, I tend to discount the impact of advertising on my life and on our culture, but the author Jean Kilbourne makes a good case that advertising does impact us a lot more than we realize.  I know it doesn't sound like the sort of book that most people would be interested in, but it's an easy read and quite absorbing.  

Kilbourne categorizes the different sorts of ads into chapters and talks about their specific cultural impact.  The first chapter, for example, is called ""Buy This 24 Year Old and Get All His Friends,"" and it talks about how media entities (magazines, cable channels, etc) promote themselves to advertisers. One of the insider ads in this chapter is from a website that promises to ""deliver Generation X"" and it shows a deliveryman carrying a male corpse wrapped in brown paper; it's really creepy and offensive.

Another chapter talks about how people are encouraged to believe that the only lasting and safe relationships they can form is with products.  Of course this is ridiculous idea, but Kilbourne is correct when she says that this is the subtext of a lot of ads.  Kilbourne also spends a chapter talking about how ads encourage people to behave irresponsibly with cars--particularly men who are encouraged to challenge the status quo and push themselves to the limit via their vehicles.  Kilbourne points out what a big problem motor accidents, drunk drinking, and road rage is in our country and she speculates about the connection between millions of ads that encourage reckless driving and millions people who have lost their lives as a result of reckless driving.

Still another chapter talks about how women are targeted with food ads.  Magazines will publish these incredible food pictures of luscious desserts, and a few pages later will also feature an article on dieting and responsible eating.  Kilbourne points out how the ads encourage women to view food as both comfort and compensation for not getting what they want.  I have noticed how foolish these food ads are, but I never really thought about it in a meta sense.  And I admit that like many women, I do eat when I am disappointed or to reward myself.  It's actually a very silly habit, and one that I can't remember being taught by my family or schoolmates.  So it's quite possible that I picked up this idea from the media.

Anyway, it's an interesting book, and has certainly challenged me to look a lot more critically at advertisements.  I just thought I was savvy before.  

In other news, I have managed to get a nasty cough.  I haven't really had a conventional cold, I just have this stupid cough that wakes me up in the middle of the night and wakes up Gary and Theodore as well.  It seems like I have been feeling tired for two weeks--mostly because I can't get a full night's sleep. It sucks.  Although the good news is that the cough seems to finally be wearing off; I actually slept through the night last night.

In other health related news, I am happy to say that my diet has been quite successful and I have lost 25 pounds.  Pretty good huh?  Being on a structured and healthy eating plan has really made me rethink my food choices and hopefully, I am going to have fewer eating problems going forward.

Well that's about all for me.  I hope everyone has been doing well."

On related but different tangent, I read an article in the NYT this morning that said that the ad industry is starting to look at Internet communities to determine which new show is going to do well.  It's a very interesting and I think all of you involved in TV fandom should read it.  <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/19/business/media/19adcol.html"" target=""_blank"">Here it is.</a>

Because of my involvement in fandom, I have long believed that TV shows need to court their related Internet communities.  Because we are the type of people that slavishly watch a show and get other poeple to watch it too.  Plus we ""get"" the show&#151;we often see it in the way that TPTB want us to.  We are sort of...tele-evangelists aren't we?"

"event","You know makes me really really irritated and frustrated?  The idea, which is frequently espoused by professors and students around NYU, that the Internet is just another arm of Big Media&#151;on par with television.  By on par I mean that they say that the Internet is run by big media and it is not the democratic tool that people first thought that it could be.  But I disagree with this.  I think that unlike watching TV, posting online creates a sense of community.  I think it puts people in touch with one another in a way that television cannot.

I have even more thoughts on this issue, but I am wondering what my LJ peers think.  I would love if some or all of you could weigh in with your talk on the Internet.  Do you think it is just another tool of media like TV or radio or the WB Store?  You know...part of the machine?  Is the freedom that I feel online an illusion?  Because see, I can't broadcast via TV or radio, but I can broadcast online.  And while it's true that I can't necessarily reach the entire world, I have a lot better chance of it online than via TV.

I think I want to write about this for my final paper presentation for my pop culture class.  Tell me what you guys think.

"event","Okay, I know I talked about this before, but I want to mention again how much I adore the Retro music channel.  Time Warner has all these music channels on the upper dials and everything is categorized by genre or era.  The Retro channel is all new wave and post-punk.  It is the soundtrack of my teenage years.  I can't believe how much I love it.  I was recording VH1 2's 80s show for a while.  But they end up playing the same videos over and over and many of them are not 80s songs I want to remember.  No Warrant or Night Ranger please.  But the Retro channel only plays the stuff I like.  You want examples?  Okay.

First up is <i><b>Eyes of a Stranger</b></i>, by the Payolas.  This was on the <i>Valley Girl</i> soundtrack&#151;it's the song that was playing when Randy crashes the party and sees Julie again.  So good and something I hadn't heard in 20 years.  
<i><b>Haunted</b></i> by the Pogues&#151;the version on the Sid and Nancy soundtrack&#151;not the Sinead O'Connor version.  
<i><b>Mirror Man</b></i>, by Human League.  <i>Don't You Want Me?</i> and <i>Fascination</i> were their big hits, but <i>Mirror Man</i> is their best in my opinion. 
<i><b>Forever Young</b></i>, by Alphaville.  I know it was on some soundtrack, but I can't remember which one.
<i><b>Harley David son of a Bitch</b></i> by Bollock Brothers.  Yeah it was a little late for New Wave, but it is.  This song reminds my of my late teens in LA.  LA had and perhaps still has a very good alternative music channel&#151;KROQ 106.7, (which is very different than the NYC KROQ).  A couple of other good songs from that era: 
<i><b>Sex Dwarf</b></i> by Soft Cell, and 
<i><b>We Care A Lot</b></i> by the original Faith No More.
Then there is <i><b>Boy</b></i> by Book of Love, 
<i><b>I Know There is Something Going On</b></i> by Frida, (nothing like a good petulant song to make you feel fourteen again), 
<i><b>If You Were Here</b></i> by Thompson Twins, (remember at the end of Sixteen Candles?!), 
<i><b>Johnny Come Home</b></i> by the Fine Young Cannibals, 
<i><b>Lessons in Love</b></i> by Level 42, 
<i><b>Let's Go to Bed</b></i> by The Cure, 
<i><b>Love My Way</b></i> by the Psychedelic Furs and 
<i><b>Never Say Never</b></i> by Romeo Void, (I didn't remember this song being quite so dark&#151;it's good stuff), 
<i><b>People Who Died</b></i> by Jim Carroll Band, (from the <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090213/"" target=_blank"">Tuff Turf</a></i> soundtrack&#151;one of my favorite movies when I was teenager&#151;Morgan I love you!  Stay strong!), 
<i><b>Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want</b></i>&#151;The Dream Academy version, (from the Ferris Bueller soundtrack), 
<i><b>Secret</b></i> by OMD, 
<i><b>Slave to Love</b></i> by Brian Ferry, 
<i><b>Small Town Boy</b></i> by Bronski Beat, (no early 80s collection would be complete w/o <i>Small Town Boy</i>), 
<i><b>Stay</b></i> and <i><b>You're History</b></i> by Shakespeare's Sister, 
<b><i>The Chauffeur</i></b> by Duran, Duran (all other DD is overplayed to me, but <i>The Chauffeur</i> still sounds good), 
<b><i>The Look of Love</i></b> by ABC, 
<b><i>True</i></b> by Spandau Ballet, (overplayed, but I still like it very much), 
<b><i>Turning Japanese</i></b> by The Vapors, (because heh)
<b><i>Under the Milky Way Tonight</i></b> by The Church (SOOOOOOOO good, I love this song).
<b><i>Wave of Mutillation</i></b> by the Pixies
<b><i>Who's that Girl?</i></b> by the Eurythmics
<b><i>Why Can't I Be You?</i></b> by The Cure (A song that really says everything there is to say about a crush)

That's the list so far.  If you know of other great songs from this era that I have missed, please let me know.

Theodore is doing very well.  I think doggie daycare has helped him to get over some of his fear of large dogs.  He actually chased a dog about ten times his size around the Park this morning.  And when a big German Shepherd came over and was sniffing him too much, Theodore bit him on the nose and drove him off.  So he's feeling more confident and assertive.  I haven't seen the lady with the greyhounds in more than a week, so maybe she has decided to keep her viscious animal at home.

Okay so I have been watching <i><b>Rome</b></i> and although I do like it, I can't say that I am terribly excited about any of it.  And it's not that I don't understand it&#151;I took a whole semester of classical history a year ago and I know the Roman story and can appreciate how accurate they are being.  Maybe that is part of the problem&#151;I have learned so much about it that nothing seems particularly unusual or colorful to me.  And all my Summer shows are over! What am I going to watch now?  I guess I will give that <b><i>Supernatural</i></b> a try since it stars one of my old TVBs from <i>Dark Angel</i> (Jensen Ackles).  And I am also going to give <b><i>Kolchak</i></b> (okay, they are calling it <i>Night Stalker</i>&#151;whatever), a looksee since it features Stuart Townsend a member of my backseat stable.

"event","Okay, so remember the dog that attacked and bit Theodore necessitating a $340 vet visit and stitches?  And remember how a few days after the attack, the same dog, now muzzled ran over and tried to attack Theodore again?  Remember how I told the owner that no, her dog didn't ""like little dogs,"" he liked to eat them, and no, her dog didn't ""like to make [little dogs] squeak,"" he liked to make them bleed?  And remember how she didn't offer to reimburse me or even seem to care that Theodore needed stitches?  Well that same fucking dog ran up on Theodore again this morning and tried to attack him.  Yes the dog had a muzzle on, but Theodore was terrified and starting screaming and running away.  I had to grab the dog by the collar and hold it to stop it from menacing my dog.  When the owner came over, she told the dog she was going to put it on the leash.  ""Good idea,"" I said.  ""Well he can't hurt him,"" she said, referring to Theodore who was cowering a few feet away.

Now this woman has crossed over into being a cunt right?  I mean I am justified in going off on her the next time this happens right?  And it will happen, because apparently she won't leash her dog and this monster has a jones for Theodore.  I already obsessively watch for this woman and her dog whenever we are out. I did see him this morning, but he was 300 feet away.  I looked away for a few seconds and he was up on Theodore before I knew what was happening.  Of course it is a greyhound.  I shouldn't be surprised at how fast he can move.

Now am I overreacting?  Let's consider the facts:

1) This greyhound attacked Theodore two weeks ago today.  It was aggressively sniffing Theodore and when he rolled over to show submission, the dog snarled, grabbed Theodore by the throat and started to shake him.  I elaborate to show that the dog was not playing--or rather if he was playing, he was playing with Theodore as if he was a stuffed toy, not another dog.

2) During the attack of two weeks ago, the greyhound punctured Theodore's throat fairly deeply, which required stitches.  It also required a course of antibiotics and a certain amount of doctoring from me, (rubbing cream on the wound, holding a warm cloth to it twice a day for a week).

3) Since the attack, Theodore is very frightened of of bigger dogs.  I have really had to work with him every day since the attack to get him comfortable around larger dogs.  At this point, he runs when he sees a large dog coming, and he startles and runs to me when he hears a couple of dogs growling while playing together.

4) Three days after the attack, the same greyhound, now muzzled, tried to attack Theodore again.  The owner was trying to call the greyhound from a distance and it completely ignored her.  It was not deterred by me screaming NO! or by me squirting water on it.  When I picked up Theodore to get him away, the greyhound jumped up on me to get to him.

5) On that same day, the greyhound also tried to attack another little dog--a daschund.  The daschund's owner told me that the greyhound had tried to attack her dog earlier as well.

6) The owner genuinely seems to think that because her dog is muzzled, it is not a big deal that it is menacing small dogs.

So, to sum up: this dog attacked Theodore three times in the last two weeks, it has attacked at least one other dog, its owner has no control over it, and she does not see that as a problem.

Here are my concerns:

1) Theodore is going to develop an even deeper fear of other dogs, one that I will not be able to cure.

2) Theodore will hurt himself trying to get away from this greyhound.  When Theodore is fleeing from this dog, he is not paying attention to anything around him.  He could barrel in front of a bicycle or a car.

3) The greyhound's attacks on Theodore will inspire other dogs in the immediate vicinity to attack Theodore in a similar manner.  These dogs will not be muzzled.

I honestly don't know what to do.  What I want is for Theodore to be safe and happy and for me not be anxious and pissed.  I guess I am just going to have to stop taking him in the morning, because it is the only way to ensure that there won't be another incident with this dog."

_______________________

Well apparently, that lady with the greyhound&#151;the one that attacked Theodore on Thursday, has put a muzzle on it.  And it's a good thing, because this morning when I was walking Theodore through the meadow in the Park, that same fucking dog came bounding of nowhere and went for Theodore again.  I snatched him up immediately.  Of course the dog couldn't do anything with a muzzle on, but you can imagine how alarmed I was.  Thank God he had a muzzle on.  I could hear his owner calling and calling him from a distance, but he was totally ignoring her.  He stayed right around me, circling and shoving his nose into Theodore&#151;the fucker even jumped up like he was going to get Theodore while I was holding him.  I yelled ""NO!"" and squirted him with Theodore's water bottle.  It didn't faze him.  So moved toward the dog menacingly saying, ""GO!"" to back him off, but he did not care. He was not leaving.  I started to walk away&#151;we weren't ready to leave, but what choice did I have?  I can't have a dog menacing Theodore&#151;even if it can't bite him.  Theodore should be able to play in the Park without being harassed.

The dog saw a little dachshund and ran over toward him.  He couldn't do anything and the little dachshund stood his ground pretty well.  I told the dachshund's owner what the dog did to Theodore and told her to watch out.  She told me that the greyhound had gone for her dachshund the day before&#151;but through the muzzle and he wasn't able to do any damage.  

The owner finally came up, it seemed like it took her hours, but of course it was less than two minutes.  She was shaking her head and pulling her dog off saying to the group of us that had gathered, ""He likes small dogs.""  I couldn't let that go, and I retorted, ""He likes to eat them."" and she said, ""Well, he likes to make them squeak,"" and I told her no, that her dog injured Theodore and he had to get stitches. And she said, ""Well I have the muzzle on him.""  I just walked off. I could have said more I guess, but I'm glad I didn't.  I was so enraged that I had to get away quickly.  

My sensible self tells me that this lady is responsible since she has muzzled her dog.  I am sure she loves her dog and that he is a good dog in many ways.  But...but, I can't feel anything right now but anger.  Theodore, as silly as it may sound, is like my child and I adore him.  He looks to me for protection and I have been having nightmares every night since he was bitten because I didn't take proper care of him.  It was good that I walked away, I wouldn't want to say anything I might regret.

Theodore seemed none the worse for wear.  He was disappointed that I made him leave the Park early. I don't know that he even realized that dog was the same one&#151;although how he could he forget?  But he never even squeaked or cried when the dog came up or when I was holding him away from the dog.  I would like to think that it was because he knew he was safe, but I am probably just projecting my desires onto him.

Anyway, alls well that ends well."

Well I have a little bit of sad news.  Theodore gotten bitten by a dog in the Park yesterday and I had to take him to the vet.  He's totally fine, but the dog did get in a single puncture wound on Theodore's neck that was pretty deep.  The vet only had to do a single stitch, but now Theodore has to wear his halo collar again!  But only for 3 days.  He was groggy yesterday after being anesthetized, but he is perky again today.  I went ahead and took him to the Park this morning as usual&#151;he needs the fresh air and exercise and I don't want him to be traumatized or anything.  But I kept him on the leash and we only stayed out for 15 minutes or so.

I feel terrible about it, because Theodore was scared of the dog that bit him.  I thought he was just wary because the dog was sort of big (a greyhound), but it turns out that dog was sending some sort of ""I'm going to eat you"" signal that Theodore understood but I didn't pick up.  So going forward, if Theodore's scared of a dog, I am going to get him away immediately regardless of whether or not it hurts the owner of the other dog's feelings.  Because this dog moved so quick&#151;thank God it all happened right at my feet, because otherwise it could have been much more serious.

I feel a little anger at the owner of the other dog, although her behavior was perfect.  She rushed over she apologized several times, she wanted to make sure Theodore was alright.  She said she would start keeping her dog away from little dogs that were scared, etc.  But this incident caused a lot of anxiety for me and that emotion has to be directed somewhere.  It really should be directed at myself.  I should have been more sensitive to Theodore's fear.

You know, I love dogs but I have had some negative experiences.  I was mauled by a samoyed when I was four&#151;I had to have plastic surgery on my face.  It wasn't really all that traumatic&#151;I was never afraid of dogs or anything.  But there was another nasty incident that left a little more of a mark&#151;one that I only just remembered a few weeks ago&#151;when I started letting Theodore play with the dogs in the Park.  

When I was five or six, our German Shepherd Smokey killed our poodle Mon Ami right in front of me. I have thought about it several times in the last few weeks and I could just kick myself for not being more careful with Theodore.  It's totally my fault&#151;he looks to me for protection. 

Because I have been taking Theodore out to the Park twice a day for the last three weeks, I have been able to interact with a society of Park Slope dog owners.  I've noticed that there's a distinct difference between the morning and evening crowd of dog owners.  The morning is all middle-aged ladies and mothers with strollers.  The evening crowd is all singles in their late twenties/early thirties&#151;it's a sort of dog-friendly meat market.

And it also gives me insight into the Park Slope dog culture.  Pet stores are bad, rescue dogs are good&#151;as I knew.  People who are over-protective of their dogs are bad, but so are people with dogs that are too aggressive.  Everyone knows all of the dogs names&#151;especially the morning crowd.  A dozen people greet Theodore by name when I take him out each morning.  And I have to admit I have learned a lot of the dogs names: Rosie, Olivia, Pepsi, Phoebe, Candy, Rhonda, Madison, Lily, Ziggy, Ava, Ulysses, etc.

I guess I will become one of those over-protective people now, but what else can I do?  Theodore loves to play with other dogs his size, but big dogs represent too much potential danger."

"event","I'm not crazy about rain, but I am sure glad that this thunderstorm finally arrived and broke up the extreme heat we have been experiencing out here in Brooklyn.  We've been having that terrible 95 degree, 95% humidity weather.  Even Theodore hates going out for a walk.  He throws a fit when I take him out and tries to pull me back into the apartment.  And if I walk him too long, he just sits his little butt down and refuses to move.  Poor little guy.  He can't help that he is such a fuzzy black(ish) dog.

I was attempting to weigh him a few weeks ago by weighing myself while holding him.  And I thought, my goodness, Theodore must weight like 25 pounds!  Because I know that I...oh wait. Yes that is me.  So I decided to go on a diet.  I actually have quite a bit of discipline when I set my mind to it, but the problem is getting everything organized.  What do I eat? How much?  How often?  Whenever I try to eat healthy on my own, I always manage to screw it up.  I have come to the realization that I don't know as much about healthy eating as I thought I did.  So I decided to get a professional to help me and I joined Jenny Craig.  My mother did it years ago and she liked it, so I thought I would give it a whirl.  

I like it so far&#151;the food is pretty good and there is quite a bit of variety&#151;certainly a lot more than I normally get.  Like a lot of people, I tend to eat a lot of the same stuff over and over because I know I like it and it's easy.  But that isn't always the wisest choice. I'll keep everyone posted about how it is all going.

Well school is starting up in another three weeks.  I really don't know what to take.  I've been feeling burned out the last two semesters and I am wondering if I can just take a semester of fun classes&#151;like greek mythology and New York City history.  I'll talk to my advisor and see what she says.

Say has anyone seen any good films lately?  I watched the <i>Motorcycle Diaries</i> and it didn't move me as much as I thought it would.  I can't say it was a bad movie&#151;I just didn't get into it as much as I wanted to.  But the music was fabulous. I am definitely buying the soundtrack.

I continue to watch BSG of course.  And wasn't ""The Farm"" a creepy episode?  That particular topic has always sort of skeeved me.  It's cropped up in various novels I have read&#151;<i>Handmaid's Tale</i>, <i>White Plague</i>, and I have always found it quite disturbing.  But the rest of the ep was good.  Kara remains my favorite character.

I had to stop watching <i>Rescue Me</i>, because it just got too soap opera-y.  I just wasn't enjoying it anymore.  At least there is still <i>Entourage</i>.

Gary is working on a big project with a tight deadline.  I hardly see him any more.  He leaves early and comes home late and even when he is here, he has to do work from home.  It's like Theodore doesn't even have a father.  It's all very sad.  Hopefully once this project launches, Gary will be able work shorter hours.  So I hardly have anything to do but play with Theodore&#151;not that that is so bad, but he is a dog you know&#151;our conversations are a little one sided...

<b>Me:</b> So what do you think about Vince and Mandy?

<b>Theodore:</b> <i>Sits on floor and licks own penis</i>

<b>Me:</b> Well yes I know Vince can be a bit of a dick, but still...I can't help but root for these two crazy kids to make a go of it.

<b>Theodore:</b> <i>Looks at me and cocks his head.  Gets up and sniffs food dish.</i>

<b>Me:</b> OMG! Did you read that <i>Times</i> article about how corporate the media is getting?  Do you think they'd like a cup of ""Duh"" with that?

<b>Theodore:</b> <i>Wags tail slowly in that ""well she is speaking in an excited voice so I should probably wag my tail for good measure"" way.</i>

<b>Me:</b> I have discovered the BEST new music channel!  Yes, it's 615 the ""Retro-Active"" channel. They play 80s New Wave 24/7!  Where the Hell was this channel when I was a teenager?

<b>Theodore:</b> <i>Farts and then looks surprised.</i>

See what I mean?  Not exactly a scintillating dialogue.

I think that some of my NYC friends should makes some plans to do some stuff with me.  Yes.  That is what I think should happen."

1) People who get on the F Train and make loud announcements to the car while I am trying to make my peaceful morning commute.

No, I'm not hungry and even if I was, I wouldn't take one of those damn bananas and apples that you have been carrying in your bare hand.  Are you of the opinion that homeless people don't need to eat sanitary food like the rest of us?  I mean at least put that food in a plastic bag or something.  And another thing, when you said your spiel the first time--I heard you and totally comprehended what you were saying.  There is no need to repeat it 7-8 more times.  I GET IT.  And so does everyone else.  No one wants that brown banana of yours--even if they are homeless and hungry.

2) That lady who hates pet stores.

Look, I know that this may come as a surprise you, but you may have crossed that line from concerned and responsible citizen to tinfoil hat weirdo (it's actually a much finer line than most people realize).  Yes, I got my dog from a pet store.  Yes, I did look at several animal shelters for months, but all of the dogs available were large pit-bull mixes.  I do not want a pit bull. I don't care that ""they are actually sweet dogs.""  Yes, yes, I have actually met pit bulls that didn't attack or bite me.  That doesn't mean that they won't ever do it.  And besides, I wanted a small dog.

Also, when I explain to you that I spent 45 minutes talking to the owner of the pet store about my concerns about buying from him, (in my usual direct style), don't tell me, ""Well they will say anything.""  Honey, using that logic, no one can be trusted--not even you.  And for the record, Michael, the guy who owns the pet store, has been in business for 15 years.  He has wanted to have a pet store since he was five years old.  He is not irresponsible and there was nothing wrong with my dog when I got him.  He was fine, (just a slight touch of kennel cough, which disappeared after a few weeks).  Michael was great and guess what?  When I buy my next dog next year?  I am buying from him again.  SO THERE.

Furthermore, when you tell me that my dog probably came from a puppy mill, and I tell you that he did not, and that I have all the information about the breeder and I have been on his site and seen the testimonials from other happy owners who have gotten dogs from him, don't tell me, ""Well anyone can put up a web site.""  Yeah, and anyone can form an opinion about something without looking at the actual fucking facts can't they?  God forbid that there might be good pet stores or responsible breeders.  I guess you won't be happy until everyone owns those ""nice"" pit bulls that the NYC shelters are full of.  Hey, I wonder why there are so many pit bulls in the shelters?  Is it because they were too ""nice"" for their owners?  I guess so.

NOTE:  I have nothing against pit bulls.  I just wanted a puppy and one that did not grow up into an overly large dog.  Dogs like that are scarce in shelters.  I'm sorry if that makes me some sort of monster that is ruining the world for dogs and people everywhere.

Okay, now here is stuff I am happy about:

1) Theodore, Theodore, Theodore!

I have some new pictures of him you can see <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/gmark/PhotoAlbum17.html"">here</a> (starting July 31st).  I have started taking Theodore into Prospect Park and letting him off the leash to play with other dogs.  OMG!  He gets SO happy.  He loves to run and play with the other doggies!  At first I was nervous about the bigger dogs, (actually I am still slightly nervous), but so far everything has been wonderful and Theodore is delirious with joy when I take him to the Park.

I kind of wish that there were more small dogs for him to play with.  He really likes to rough-house a bit and the big dogs are too big for that.  But fortunately, I can usually find a small dog for him to play with a couple of times a week.  So that is better than nothing.


2) Entourage, Battlestar Galactica, and America's Test Kitchen.

Thank you for being so entertaining that I can't wait to see you each week!  May I always have a good show to look forward to."

"event","Now I think everyone here knows that I <i>never</i> complain about anything&#151;yes?  I am the last one to criticize the pageant of stupidity that dances before my eyes on a daily basis.  But there are one or two things that I must get off my chest. 

<b>Buses are big and sometimes they have to turn.</b>
Yes, it's true.  Buses do have to turn onto streets sometimes.  So if you are a cab/livery driver dropping off a passenger and there is a bus behind you trying to turn, DO NOT BLOCK THE BUS.  It is actually very simple: DO NOT BLOCK THE BUS.  See, because buses are so big, they need what is called ""a wide turning radius,"" this means that they need the full width of the street to turn onto, (at least until they have straightened out).  Yes.  So when you block the side of the street, these buses cannot complete their turn.  This is a problem, because then the bus is stuck, blocking the flow of traffic onto the street.  Then guess what?  The traffic piled up to go onto the street begins to block the flow of traffic on the Avenue perpendicular to the street.  And pedestrians at all four corners are inconvenienced as well&#151;not only can they not cross the street easily, but they have to listen to the incredibly loud honking that quickly ensues once the traffic starts to build up.

It never ceases to amaze me how much trouble one asshole can cause.  It makes me feel hope and despair.

So the lesson?  DO NOT BLOCK THE BUS.

I suppose I am a bit cranky because I was riding the <b>jinx train</b> today.  That's the train that has every problem you can imagine.  As part of my commute, have to take the F to Borough Hall and then switch to the A or C to 42nd Street.  Well the F train was late.  Not only does that mean that I am late, but it also means that I have to ride a crowded train, because late trains give the crowd on the platform extra time to build.  Then, we were barely out of my station when there was a signal alert, (whatever that means).  Essentially the train can't move until the signal alert is over.  So that was ten minutes.  Then, I finally got to Borough Hall and switched.  We hadn't gone three stops when I realized guess what?  Yes, the Sick Passenger was on my train.  When the conductor made the announcement, (""Attention riders, we have a 'sick passenger' on the train, we are being held at the station until the EMS arrives""), everyone on the car groaned in a very funny way.  

Now you would think that would be enough right?  I was already running half an hour late.  But no.  A few stops later, the doors in my car stopped working.  So that was another ten minutes while the conductor came out and manually opened one door, and while some MTA guy on the platform fiddled around until the doors worked.

So, I was 45 minutes late.  Thank you MTA!

<b>I gave Theodore a little haircut yesterday.</b>  Although his body hair remains short, the hair on this head was getting a little long.  So I trimmed him a bit.  Gary had to hold him and we stood in the bathtub while I snipped away&#151;I tried to get the cut as even as possible&#151;I think it came out fine, although Theodore's hair looks a little spiky.  He doesn't care though.

He and I had a little communication breakthrough the other day.  At various points, Theodore gets the crazies and starts running up and biting at my pant leg for no reason.  I finally realized that when he does that, he wants me to play with him.  So I throw one of his toys down the hall and he brings it back.  We do that for about ten minutes and he settles right down.

He's gotten longer, and when they weighed at the vet week ago, he was 7.1 pounds.  That's double the weight he was when we got him.  Gary made me switch him to two meals a day instead of three.  I guess it is easier now that I don't have to rush home and give him that 3pm feeding.  I do leave him a little kibble during the day for him to snack on, so he does not totally starve.

This weekend was pretty uneventful.  I went to some Greek restaurant called Avra on Saturday, which was really good and nice, (despite the fact that it serves fish almost exclusively and I don't eat fish).  I recommend it.

I watched one of my favorite quirkly 70s movies, <i>Dr. Phibes Rises Again</i>.  This film, along with it's predecessor, <i>The Abominable Dr. Phibes</i> is one of my favorite camp horror films.  Others include, <i>Invasion of the Bee Girls<i>, <i>Spectre</i>, and of course, <i>The Wickerman</i>."

"event","I had a pretty good weekend.  On Friday I met <lj user=""fleegull"">, <lj user=""nerodi"">, and <lj user=""scribblinlenore""> for lunch at Dos Caminos, which is a very nice Mexican restaurant on lower Park Ave.  After <lj user=""nerodi""> and <lj user=""scribblinlenore""> bailed, <lj user=""fleegull""> and I wandered down 6th Ave, in the sweltering midday Manhattan heat, (all that asphault and concrete really amps the heat index yo), until we finally found a small restaurant/bar and had another drink.

One of the main topics of conversation was Tom Cruise's meltdown.  I mean it's fairly obvious that he has flipped his lid.  Of course it is no surprise to me, I've always disliked him, (since Mimi Rogers), and I always knew that scientology stuff was batshit crazy.  They try to play it off like it's some sort of philosophy and not a religion, but once someone gets higher up in the scientology totem pole, that's when they start talking about being <a href=""http://www.xenu.net/roland-intro.html"" target=""new"">reincarnated from aliens and shit</a>.  

Now normally, belonging to some weird religion would not be enough to make me not like someone--I mean I did live in LA for several years, but what I really don't like about Tom Cruise is his extreme popularity. See, I have just never thought he was all that, and it annoys me to have him constantly thrown in my face and exalted.  This is something that happens with a lot of famous people--they reach a point of over-exposure and I start to get tired of them.  Then the over-exposure continues and I start to get annoyed.  Usually this sort of intense exposure doesn't last more than a few years.  But Tom Cruise has been at this level of super-popularity since the late 80s and I am waaaaaaaaaay beyond tired of him.

Furthermore, he's a control-freak.  He rigorously controls his image--everyone who works for him, (and possibly with him--who knows), signs iron-clad confidentiality agreements and whenever I see him smile, I don't feel amusement or pleasure, but fear.  He seems like a very scary guy to be around, because if you cross him, he will fuck you up.  I believe that he would do it and obviously he has the power to do so. 

Also?  He is not a great actor and not really all that good looking.  He seems to play the same role in every single movie--the cocky guy who gets his comeuppance.  If only Tom Cruise's real life was like his film roles, I might not dislike him so much.  But there's hope.

See I think Tom has started to cross a line.  I'm not talking about acting crazy and obnoxious in all his interviews, (although obviously that is inappropriate behavior), no, I am talking about the little scientology publicity campaign that Tom is launching.  Regardless of how he positions scientology, there is a group of people who have a sensitive nose for any set of beliefs that challenges the status quo.  Yes, it is our friends the Religious Right.  Mark my words, as Tom amps up his scientology talk and young people start to listen to him, Christians are going to get testy.  In fact, I think scientology has a good change of filling the slot vacated by the Soviet Union in the Religious Right's trinity of intolerance, (abortion, homosexuality, and communism).  It'll be fun.  So go on with yourself Tom.  I'll be sitting back with the popcorn.

I have some new Theodore pictures, which you can see <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/gmark/PhotoAlbum17.html"" target=""new"">here</a>, (starting with June 16).  My favorite is the very last one of me and Theodore on the couch.  I think it is fabulous picture of the two of us.

But here is the bad news:  Theodore got neutered yesterday.  When I took him to the vet, I also had him ""groomed,"" because his hair was getting a bit long.  The vet has a ""groomer"" on staff.  He pushed me to shave Theodore, but I said no, because I think that looks stupid.  But I didn't mind a good cut and I asked them to leave his fur about an inch long.

Well they didn't.  They completely shaved him except for his head and his tail--they just trimmed those areas.  AND!  He has to wear a halo collar to keep him from biting his stitches.  He looks SOOOOOOOOOO terrible.  And he knows it.  Yesterday, when I brought him home, he just sat in the middle of the floor with his head down.  It was the saddest thing I have ever seen in my life.  He HATES the halo collar and he keeps running into things.  Gary went to veternarian's hospital nearby and got him a clear halo so that at least he can see.  Poor little baby.  Plus he's shaved!!!!! Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!  It looks so awful!  I am super-pissed.  SUPER-PISSED!  And I paid $45 to ""groom"" him.  Oy! 

Plus my mom is coming to visit on Saturday and she will have to see him all shaved and bucket-headed.  Poor little guy!"

<lj-cut text=""spoilers"">
I liked it, although I am not sure I would have liked it as much if it wasn't Christian Bale--but maybe I would have.  I liked all the detailed background info and the exploration of Bruce's angst and all that.  I was really interested in that whole period when he was a criminal--I would like to see a whole movie about that actually.  But anyway, the problems I had with the film involved two things: 1) It was too loud; and 2) It was too fast and dark.  I know, I know.  When did Kimberly become such an old lady, you are thinking.  Well I'm not sure when it happened, but I found myself on the phone with my father last night in the middle of a mutual rant about how loud, dark, and fast action movies had gotten, and neither of us thought it was a good thing.

I think the first inkling I had that movies were getting too loud was way back during the first Jurassic Park.  I remember being freaked out by the T-Rex, not because he was a giant lizard about to pluck that little girl out of the car like a white chocolate truffle, but because of the extremely loud volume of his roars.  I remember thinking DAMN! because the whole theater was vibrating like an earthquake.  Every since then, with increasing frequency, it has seemed like the volume of movies has gotten louder and louder.  It is not unusual for me to put my hands over my ears during films like LOTR or Star Wars, because it's just TOO LOUD!

And let's talk about this new fast-cutting fight thing.  I'm sure it's been around for a while, but the first time I really noticed it was during that utter and complete fiasco--Alexander.  See what they do is zoom in to the action--so close that you are focusing on something as small as a hand waving a sword or punching a chin and then they cut rapidly to some other zoomed in piece of action--always very specific and detailed.  And for some inexplicable reason, these scenes are always shot in dim lighting.  I can't see anything that is going on and when I do, it is in ultra zoom and therefore, I cannot get a sense of where anyone is, what is happening, or what the Hell is going on.  Maybe the filmmaker wants the audience to feel disoriented during these fight scenes, but it just makes me nauseous and headachy.  I much prefer the theatrical choreography of the Matrix films where you can see what is going on and you can savor the action.

So those were two problems with Batman, which were not all that big of a deal, because I really didn't go to see the action, but to see Bruce Wayne's story.

Another very minor niggling issue that is irrelevant because a) this was all about Bruce Wayne and CB for me, and because b) she's a lost cause on account of the Tom Cruise/Scientology thing, is the Katie Holmes character.  I found her unnecessarily bitchy.  There were some parts where it worked, like when Bruce showed her the gun he was going to shoot his parent's killer with, but there were times when it was just...well...bitchy like when she met Bruce after ""swimming"" (She sees him back from the dead for the first time in years and her first remark is some sanctimonious bullshit? Puhlease), and when she told Bruce at the end that she wasn't going to be with him because he was Batman.  I mean what a cunt!  Tom Cruise can have her, I say.

Anyway, I loved CB and I loved Michael Caine. 
</lj-cut>

Entourage...

Well, although I feel guilty about it, I am relieved that Vince agreed to do Aquaman.  Because I am worried that the boy won't have enough money otherwise.

I think you can see a real difference in him when you compare the earliest pictures with the most recent ones.  He looks so sad and lost in the early pix, but now look how happy and perky he looks! 

I'm afraid that Theodore has been auditioning for the role of the Baddest Little Dog in All the Land.  He favorite pastime is biting skin (it's like a vocation for him).  I have been working with him and I can stop him about half the time, which is good I guess.  The other bad thing he has started to do is humping. Oh and he chews the grout in the floor.  And he has started barking a lot more.  Hopefully, a lot of these issues will clear up once we can actually take him outside and walk him--he gets his final shots tomorrow.

The best time to interact with him is when he is sleepy, because then he doesn't try to chew on me.  I clean his eyes and brush him every day and I always get him from his nap to do this so he is all loll-y and non-resistant."

"event","Well!  I know everyone is waiting with baited breath to find out how things are going with Theodore.  Things are going fine, although it has been quite an adjustment to have a puppy in the house.  Our sleeping habits have changed.  There is no more sleeping late, as Theodore needs to be fed and played with and the like.  And we have both gotten used to looking under our feet all the time because Theodore likes to be as close to us as possible.

Fortunately, we have gotten Theodore to potty in the same spot--on the wee-wee pad in front of the bathroom door.  Gary set up a baby gate just outside the bathroom doorway, and so that room has become Theodore's little space.  That's where he hangs out when we can't supervise him directly.  We put his crate and toys and dishes in there and he is actually quite happy with that arrangement.  Of course when he is wide awake and playful, he wants to hang out with us, so we have a spot for him in the living room as well.  He's pretty comfortable with the leash now and so I tether him to a spot in the LR with a double leash and that way he can walk around a bit without going off somewhere and getting into trouble.  Of course, the first few days, he was too timid to go anywhere on his own, but now, after five days, he has turned into a little explorer and he likes to wander around the apartment checking things out.  We dont' let him do this very often because we haven't dog-proofed the whole apartment yet.  

Oh and he started barking on Wednesday.  At first, all he would do is make squeaky-whining noises, but now he barks when he gets excited.  I was out of the office most of this last week, but I did have to go in on Thursday.  I hadn't had much sleep since we got Theodore, so I Wednesday night I took an Ambien and retired around 8:30.  I told Gary that he was in charge.

I wasn't in bed ten minutes when I heard a loud commotion.  I heard a high pitched sound and Gary saying, ""NO! NO!"" and them some stomping up the hall.  So I came out of the bedroom (pissed) and said, ""WHAT IS GOING ON?!!!"" (I was a bit cranky from the lack of sleep you see).  Gary said, ""He has gone crazy,"" and sure enough, I could see Theodore running around in the bathroom growling and...well...barking.  Gary told him ""NO!"" but Theodore stood his ground and yip-yipped at Gary.  I could see that Gary was truly mystified about how to handle this.  

""Don't let him do that,"" I said.  ""Don't let him dominate you.""  So Gary went in the bathroom tried to pick up Theodore to calm him down.  Of course Theodore was terribly excited and he bit Gary--he was just playing, but obviously, we don't want him to think it's okay to bite us--even in play.  Gary jerked away when Theodore bit him, and this annoyed me because, come on!  How hard can a 4 pound dog bite?  And I'm afraid that if Gary jerks away, Theodore will think that he is playing and will get even more excited.  And of course, that is exactly what happened.  

When he bites me, I say, ""OUCH!"" in a loud voice and then he lets go immediately in surprise.  He seems to be learning, because now he tends to lick me more than bite me (and when he licks, I say, ""Good boy! Good boy!"" and stroke him).

I can't wait to be able to take him outside for walks.  He still has a final round of shots in a week and a half; he can't go outside until he has had those.  But I think he will really love the Park.  
________________________________

One of the unforseen side-effects of Theodore is that I haven't thought about myself very much.  It's kind of surprising to realize just how much I live in my own head; that is not possible while supervising a rambunctious doggie.  I half-forgot about my birthday, but obviously I can't forget about it completely.  I am looking forward to some non-puppy time tomorrow night.

I will see everyone who is coming at Apple at 6pm!"

"event","Guess what!  Gary and I got a puppy!  Yes!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!! Finally huh?  I mean how long does a girl have to wait?  But Gary told me last week that we could get one for my birthday.  So we went to a pet store here in Brooklyn, (I checked it out, they are very reputable and only buy from reputable breeders), on Saturday and I found my boy!  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!  He is a cross between a bichon frise and a cairn terrier (apparently this new breed is called ""kashon"").  He is black with some white markings on his chin, chest, and feet.  <a href=""http://homepage.mac.com/gmark/PhotoAlbum17.html"" target=""_blank"">I have some pictures here.</a>

What you can't see in the pictures is that although his fur is quite black on the top, underneath, it is very pale&#151;nearly white.  I am thinking that when he gets bigger and has his first haircut that he may change from a black dog to a white dog!  But I don't know.  I picked him out because he was the most active and jumpy and excited when he saw me&#151;even through the glass.  His brother, who was in the cage with him was also friendly, but was a little skittish and standoffish.  I felt bad about separating them, but I am not ready for two dogs yet.  So little rambunctious and aggressive Theodore came home with me!

Just a reminder about my birthday thing on this coming Saturday (June 4th).  It will be at Apple ( 17 Waverly Pl, btwn Greene & Mercer St ), at six.  Because of Theodore I am going to leave around nine.  I realize that isn't long, but hey, its quality not quantity!  

If you haven't already told me that you are coming, please do so.  I want to reserve a couch or two for us."

"event","As you get older, you become more yourself.  What this means is that you reconcile yourself to the parts of your personality that are not going to change.  You learn to manage yourself&#151;mostly by avoiding situations in which you may be tempted to behave badly.  

So if you have a tendency to get cranky when you haven't had enough to eat or enough sleep, then by all means, avoid aggravating situations when you are hungry or sleepy.  Examples include: shopping, standing in line at the bank or post office, riding on the subway with a bunch of teenagers, discussing important matters* with your significant other, calling customer service about some problem you are having with your bank account.

Now that is not to say that you should not try to not be cranky when you are hungry or sleepy.  You should certainly do that.  But it won't work&#151;at least not all of the time. The only thing that truly works is avoiding situations that piss you off.

Of course, no matter what you do, the ""bad parts"" still remain and like the other more benevolent parts of your personality, you must permit them expression&#151;at least sometimes.  What I have found is that if I don't let the nastier parts of my out every now and then, they tend to burst out on their own and at very inappropriate and unfortunate times, (family dinners, phone calls with my mother, business meetings, on the subway).

Okay here's my new potential political hero: Eliot Spitzer. What I like about him is that he is not a pussy.  

Here's a list of interesting articles I have come across on Spitzer:

Meet Eliot Spitzer:
<a href=""http://slate.msn.com/id/2108509/"" target=""blank"">Slate</a>
<a href=""http://www.newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/politics/newyork/features/10815/"">New York Magazine</a>

A recent criticism that Spitzer is getting beside himself:
<a href=""http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2005/05/12/54933.htm"">National News</a>

I have to admit that the powers that the Martin Act gives the Attorney General are disturbing, particularly considering that Spitzer seems to be fully utilizing his authority.  I do have two concerns about him: 1) That he is lumping the innocent with the guilty and not making amends to the innocent when he uncovers his mistake; and 2) That he is the type to broadly interpret the powers of whatever office he holds&#151;this might work fine for Spitzer, who seems to be ethical and progressive, but what his successors?

As everyone knows, I adore TR with all my heart, but there are some unfortunate consequences of his administration.  During his two terms of office, TR expanded the powers of the Executive Branch more than any President in history (at that time).  This worked out very well because it permitted TR to fight corrupt corporations and spur social changes, (labor laws, pure food and drug laws, conservation), that many of us today take for granted.  And most of his changes were supported by a large majority of the American population.  The problem is that TR didn't stay President forever.  He had a successor&#151;several of them&#151;and a hundred years later we find ourselves with another President broadly interpreting his authority and this time in a way that a lot of us don't support.  You see, I believe there is a direct line between the powers that TR expanded and the powers that Dubya welds.  So I am always mindful of ambitious office holders who push the limits of their power. 

However, these concerns of mine are not enough to turn me off Spitzer&#151;at least not yet.  I will continue to watch him with interest.

I have to admit that I enjoy street vendors.  Recently when my girlfriend Deanne came to visit, I encouraged her to buy a knock-off handbag from a vendor.  She was naturally concerned, but I assured her that everyone did it.  Now I see the NYT has <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/26vendors.html"" target=""new"">an article recognizing the street vendor trend</a>.

However, I do agree that the vendors should be paying their taxes.  I wonder how you can tell whether or not they are an official vendor that reports and pays his taxes?  I suppose I will have to forgo them if there is no way to tell.

"event","Okay, I have a new subway miscreant to add to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kstanley/152393.html#cutid1"" target=""new"">my list</a>.  This one is actually a subset of the singer&#151;it's the hummer.  No, no.  Not that kind of hummer&#151;that might actually be mildly entertaining.  I am speaking of people who hum under their breath, or as the case may be, not under their breath, while riding on the subway.  I was sitting next to an elderly Hasidic man who hummed so loudly that I could hear him clearly over the ear-splitting <i><b>Matrix Reloaded</b></i> score.

I'm also going to have to add people who talk on the cell phone to my list of subway annoyees.  There are only two stops above ground on my subway trip, but during those two stops, there are always several people who immediately get on their cell phones and say things like, ""I can't talk because we are going into a tunnel, but I will be home in ten minutes.""  What?  You call to say that you can't talk and you will be home in ten minutes?  WHY?  See my theory about these people is that they cannot bear their own company.  And so they embrace any chance to distract themselves from their constant self-dissatisfaction.  

This is the same group of people who talk on the cell phone during pedicures and even manicures!  I could understand if there was some sort of emergency and they had to talk to someone, but that is not the case from what I can hear.  And I can't help but hear, because everyone speaks so damn loudly.  Why do people talk so loudly when they are on cell phones?  I realize that the cell phone user might have a hard time hearing via the tiny earpiece that modern cell phones have, but that doesn't mean that the person on the other end has a hard time hearing.  I guess it is the loudness that makes these people so annoying.  If they were quieter in their cell phone conversations, I wouldn't notice them.

Adding to my annoyance today was the fact that I was waylaid by the Sick Passenger this morning.  Of course I don't really believe that there is one sick passenger that goes around the subway lines getting sick and slowing things down&#151;obviously to cover all subway and train lines in the Tri-State area on a full time basis, there has to be at least a dozen Sick Passengers.  I figure they are employed by the same agency that hires those people who span narrow sidewalks in the Village and don't give you room to pass even when you say, ""Excuse me.""

Okay so I have my birthday outfit all planned out!  Yes.  I can hardly wait to debut it.  I am going to be wearing a new color for me&#151;turquoise!  Unbeknownst to me, turquoise is actually a brilliant color for me.  Yes!  I found a marvelous v-neck, sleeveless, chiffon and rayon top with a white sequin band at the (empire) waist.  It is sooo gorgeous!  AND! I got sandals that match!  Could you die?  They are turquoise leather with little flowers and a small heel.  And I have dangly earrings in a darker turquoise shade.  I figure I will use my white sequined evening bag and wear white linen trousers.  It will be fabulous.

Just a reminder that my birthday is June 4th&#151;that is a week from Saturday.  We will be meeting for drinks and nibbles at Apple (off Washington Square--same place as last year) around 5-6pm (more details later).  If you want to come and haven't checked in with me, please do so.  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kstanley/127035.html"" target=""new"">Here are some pictures from last year, to remind everyone how fun it was.</a>
__________

Listen, I have been reading this biography about Winston Churchill the last week or so and I am surprised at how slutty the English aristocracy was during the Victorian era.  I don't suppose they have changed much in the last hundred or so years, which explains a lot about the current British royals.
__________

<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/opinion/25miller.html?hp"" target=""new"">I was reading a good opt-ed piece in the Times today about how jobs should be changed.</a>

It's interesting because this idea&#151;the idea that corporate jobs need to be changed to suit human priorities rather than perceived corporate ones, is one that I have considered for a long time.  The question of course, is how much can you humanize Corporate America before you destroy profitability?  I think it's a problem that needs to be seriously considered rather than just dismissed as some utopian ideal.

Part of the problem for me is that since I have been working, I have become more and more attached to my job.  I don't mean psychologically, I mean physically, or rather, virtually.  I can and do access my job from home.  I can log into my e-mail, my network, and my publishing system.  When we were doing disaster recovery analysis, I realized that I could easily do my entire job from home with very minimal adjustments.

Now on the surface this seems like a good thing right?  Because I can take more time off and I don't always have to go into the office to get things done.  There's a real pleasure in rolling out of bed, having a few sips of coffee, answering some e-mails and then having a leisurely breakfast in front of morning television before going back to ""work"" for an hour or so.  But over time, I have come to realize that there is a flip side to all this access and it's this: the access flows both ways.  Not only can I access work whenever I want, it can access me whenever it wants.  So I end up working when I am sick, or working during times that I normally would not be (like checking to make sure an newsletter went out at midnight).  And the thing is, this sort of work is expected.  Whereas once I took care of something from home or during off hours in an emergency, I am now regularly asked to take care of things during off hours.  Now this might be more typical when you work in technology and television like I do.  These are both 24/7 industries and so there is a precedent for people working around the clock.  But still...it bugs me.

I don't think I am alone in this.  I have talked to several people who get calls from their bosses after work, before work, on the weekends, during vacation, etc.  And yet, when I start to talk about this, some people get annoyed with me.  They say things like, ""Well of course, I want to do my best work,"" or ""Of course, I want to do my job,"" etc, etc.  They treat my suggestion that the line between home and work has been uncomfortably blurred as sacrilege.  They seem threatened by the idea.  But that is understandable because they realize that if they don't do the work, then their company can easily hire someone who will.

But it is interesting to consider that just a hundred or so years ago, labor unions were fighting to reduce the work week to forty hours and that now, that has all (sneakily, I might add), been falling by the wayside.

Gary has been working so hard at his new job that he often doesn't get home until nearly 8pm.  I have been trying to be supportive and so I try to make dinner for him most nights so he doesn't have to worry about picking something up or preparing something.  But yesterday, I just was not in the mood to cook so you know what I made Gary?  I heated up these frozen chicken fingers and hash browns and served them with with a handful of baby carrots (vegetables dontcha know), and some Ranch dressing (as dipping sauce).  Yes.  I served my husband a child's meal and he loved it!  He is SOOO silly.  Tonight I think I will try cut up hot dogs and cheese bits and grapes."

"event","Gary and I watched <b><i>Kinsey</i></b> last night and it was pretty funny and interesting.  It is surprising to consider how ignorant people were just fifty years ago about sex and pleasure and what is normal and what is not.  And I have to admit that some of the things that Kinsey and his team said and did is still a little startling even to my 21st century eyes.  I guess we still have a ways to go as a culture--getting around our inhibitions I mean.  I was especially amused to see Tim Curry cast as Kinsey's prudish nemesis.  He played a professor colleague of Kinsey's who lectured his hygiene class that sex was not necessary and abstinence was preferable to sex outside of marriage or even to masturbation.  I think it says something about our society that Tim Curry has gone from playing Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the 70s to playing an inhibited professor 30 years later.

I've often thought that despite the prevalence of sex in the media that our society is more inhibited than it was when I was a child.  I could be mistaken of course; when I was a kid anything involving sex loomed larger than life, and now it tends to fade into the background.  So my perception of inhibition could simply be rooted in the fact that nothing shocks me anymore.  I don't know.

Last weekend I watched <i><b>Kingdom Hospital</b></i> (the Stephen King version).  I enjoyed it a lot until the last few episodes.  I recommend it, but just don't watch the last two episodes.  Whatever you do, don't watch the last episode.  I know it's an odd request and when you watch the show you will want to know what is going on, but believe me, whatever you imagine is a lot better than what TPTB come up with.  You are better off just watching the first eleven eps and riding off into the sunset of your imagination. 

Increasingly, shows that attempt to tie everything up into some neat package at the end annoy me.  They never explain things in the way that I want them explained and a lot of times they explain things I am not interested in at the expense of things I am interested in.   I wish there was some way to have a show that creates and solves a mystery without disappointing me.  

Last weekend, my high school best friend Deanne came into town with her husband.  They won some contest to see the final episode of Survivor in NYC.  So they got a free weekend.  I hung out with them on Saturday and Sunday.  The three of us went to the Carnegie Deli and ended up being seated next to two Texans.  What are the odds that Texans get seated next to Texans in an NYC deli?  Fairly good I guess.

Now here's what is funny: everyone, (Deanne and her husband, and these two Texans we sat next to) talked about how friendly NYCers are.  I had to laugh because I guess that stereotype of NYCers being rude still floats around the country.  You know, no doubt visitors to NYC encounter rude people on occasion, but the fact is, we have 8 mil folks here, (not counting the million or so tourists that are regularly present), so if you come to NYC, you are bound to encounter all sorts of behavior--rude or otherwise.

Of course I preened under the NYC praise. I am always happy to have people be as enchanted with the city as I am--especially when it comes to Texans, whose good opinion, if I am honest with myself,  I value above that of others.  

So my birthday is actually two weeks from tomorrow.  I want to have a party but I don't know where to have it.  I want to extend an invitation to the Tri-Staters on my FL, (and obviously anyone who happens to be here at the time), to whatever bash I throw.  But I am open to suggestions of places to go.  Saturday is hard because a lot of places are crowded then. I would prefer a place that is less crowded.  If any of you have good birthday party bar recommendations, please let me know."

I adore the contrast between the last few weeks of school&#151;studying intently, writing final papers, micro-managing my time, and the the first few weeks after the semester ends where I have loads of unstructured time to do whatever I wish.  It is so pleasurable.  Of course in about two weeks I will start to get bored and will have to start scheduling things to do.  But right now?  I am enjoying the happiness that sudden aimlessness brings.

What I need is something to counter all these heavier books.  I am looking for beach reads&#151;fun stuff by writers who can keep my attention and not make me roll my eyes in incredulity too much.  I'm talking about books that are simple enough so that I don't have to reread the last paragraph twice to understand what the writer is saying. 

I've actually found one&#151;<i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/044653143X/qid=1115835947/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-1835925-2097615?v=glance&s=books&n=507846"" target=""_blank"">Brimstone</a></i> which is a new paperback.  It's pretty entertaining so far.  An art critic is found dead in his fancy Long Island estate&#151;apparently he has been burned alive&#151;from the inside out.  Local police don't know what to make of a cloven hoof they find burned into the floorboard near the body.  Is the killer the Devil or some very clever assassin?  It's a very complex yet utterly light book that integrates a lot of details about NYC, the NYPD, Biblical scripture, Italian opera, gothic ruins, and technology.  

But one light read won't be enough.  I am open to suggestion, so if you guys have anything to recommend, please do so.  I prefer something that is not tear-jerking&#151;although I would make an exception for the right thing.

Of course, CNN continues to be amazingly sucky.  I'm sort of stunned at how bad the channel has gotten in the last three months.  I don't know if they had a management change or what, but I wish had some of whatever the head of programming is smoking.  That must be some good shit to make him/her think that CNN's current programming even approaches acceptability.  Why don't they put the little ""i"" at the end of their call letters and be done with it?  As in CNNi&#151;CNN Infotainment.
Am I the only one that this strikes as wrong?  What the Hell is going on in the network news industry since the election?  They are just in freefall.

"event","I went to my New Media Technologies class last night.  We had a guest speaker, an expert on Internet law, named Susan Drucker.  She talked about how difficult it has been for governments, corporations, and individuals to regulate the Internet.  

There are several high-profile cases going through the courts now, including <b>""MGM vs. Grokster,""</b> a case that is going to be heard by the Supreme Court later this month.

MGM, representing the movie industry, has sued Grokster for running a peer-to-peer service that permits people all over the world to share files.  Many of the files that are being shared, (movies, music, software), are copyright protected; people are able to get materials that they should be paying for for free.  

This issue is, how do you legislate this sort of thing and who is responsible?  MGM and others like them think that companies that provide the means for transmitting illegal copies are liable.  The lower courts have disagreed however, saying that peer-to-peer file sharing should be treated no differently than telephone service.  You can't sue the telephone company if someone uses the phone to sell you an illegal product.  The whole idea is ridiculous.   But it will be interesting to see what the Supreme Court decides.

Of course this whole <a href=""http://www.frienditto.com/"" target=""new"">Friend Ditto thing</a> reminds me of this debate.  Friend Ditto allows people to archive their journal entries and the journal entries of their friends--including friends only entires.  It facilitates that process I mean.

I have seen at least two people on my friends list expressing concern that this archiving means that people will be displaying their friends locked entries to an audience that was not intended to see these entries.  Of course this isn't something new.  Anyone on your friends list could copy and display any of our friends locked entries on any public site they wished.  In fact I've seen it done more than once. 

Some other people have said this, but let me remind everyone, if you think you have privacy on the Internet, you are wrong.  And that's not paranoia talking, it is just a fact.    

The way I see it, it is not Friend Ditto that is the problem here, it is ignorant or unethical ""friends.""  It's pretty obvious to me that if you friends lock an entry, you don't want it referenced in a public way.  If your ""friends"" choose to disregard that, there is not a whole lot you can do about it except unfriend them.

The real problem with Friend Ditto seems to be the fact that it is a third party group asking for your Live Journal password.  Giving out your password to a third party is always a bad idea and I would actively discourage that."

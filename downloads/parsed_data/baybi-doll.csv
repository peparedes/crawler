"event","This is a poem i wrote a couple days ago, any one feel free to comment on it. :)


The pain i put behind my eyes
The things i hide to make you happy
The way i hold my self to not let a tear out
The way it seems like no one can answer my cries

I try to act like im happy
It works so very good
no one can see im holding it in
But if someone looked into my eyes
they would see im nothing but dreary"

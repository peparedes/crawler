"event","I feel fat....ooo...CHEETOS! *promptly stuffs face in bag*

I just swigged...or gargled...whatEvan...peroxide...The White Trash way of whitening teeth. I love my teeth. They are straight, and white, and pretty.

I am going to dinner tonight with my friends Dan and Bob. We'll eat, laugh, make fun of different ethnic, religious, disabled, and sexual groups...and then I will go home and do home work. What a life. 

Ya know what would be nice? To be asked out on a date. For someone to say, ""Hey, I just wanted to know if you'd like to go out to lunch with me sometime."" (or coffee, or dinner, or a movie, or a walk on a sunset beach with the smell of jasmine in breeze...insert for your taste.) 

Today is, ""Don't even jive ta me cuz I be fucking hot, an' I will beeotch smoke yo' ass if ya try what 'chew trippin foo'"" day. (said in a ebonic voice of course) I am wearing a wrinkled very light pink...almost white...shirt from American Rag. A blue no sleave Levi's tee. A Calvin Klein cream colored jacket. Tight gray blue chords. and last but not least. White, maroon, and silver Steve Maddens. 

Currently I am reading Generation X by Douglas Coupland and Animal Husbandry by Laura Zigman.

"event","You are a Slutcom 0, also known as the frigid level of slutcom. Slutcom 0 is someone who hasn't been with too many people, if they've been with people at all. Hook-ups are practically non-existant - there may be one or two in the past, but nothing consistent or spectacular. You're a card carrying member of the prude patrol, or at least close.

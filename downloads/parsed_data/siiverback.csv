He had us build a back porch/yard/stoneyard I'm not sure what to call it, but we had to get these 30/40+ pound thick ass tiles and fit em' into the wet, dense sand on the downstairs area of his house, well the outside atleast... We did some hard work on this, and it took a lot of thinking, effort, concentration to get this shit done, and I'm proud of it... It's not everyday you walk on something this nice, and realize... ""Damn... We built this shit man...""

Here's some more details and shit; you see the red object on the ground? that's a laser beam we had to use to measure the deck out into a perfectly flat that kinda curves down hill at the end for the water to stream... It's that precise, and this shit was done back when it was like 30 degrees out... I couldn't feel shit for 2 days... I had to sit near the heater lol...

People can't open up now adays, and be themselves, and let people know the truth... Well here's my truth, and I could give a fuck what people think you know... I'm a man, I've dealt with struggle, I'm dealing with struggle and I'm not afraid to say sometimes you just gotta let it out... Men cry... Shit... It takes more balls for a man to open up and be truthful, than for a man to just keep that shit inside and act like he dosn't feel pain, that's bullshit... every man feels pain, you can either be a man with balls and pride and cry when you have to or you can be a stuck up dick thinking your the hardest all the time...

"event","In no particular order... yet, atleast... I'm just trying to get down everything i need to persue... then after i have a legit list of resolutions, I'll put them in order of most important to least important...

-Completely quit smoking, or inducing any form of illegal substances
-Get a Job
-Get all of my problems with the Law straightened out so I can try and get my record cleared...
-Stop taking pills and place my faith on Herbals or Vitamins for my health issues
-Make the Varsity Soccer Team
-Set myself a REALISTIC and REASONABLE amount of standards and limits to work with during my every day life
-Attend tutorial every day after school until I get my grades balanced out
-Pay off my depts to people I owe
-Help my mother whenever I can, when she is in need
-Set an Example for my younger brother
-Spend atleast a week every month with my step father, especially now...
-Pray before every meal, and Wash my hands before and after every meal
-Make an attempt to stop cursing, and make an attempt to learn from my mistakes instead of sounding foolish
-Get my license
-Save whatever money I earn, which will sooner or later lead to the purchase of a car
-Contemplate ways to double my profit at the time i receive it, instead of rushing to the shopping mall and wasting it
-Get my Poetry copywritten
-Give myself more credit for my positive qualities, as well as stop being so harsh on myself
-Find out what ultimately motivates me to take action
-Stop wasting my money on CD's, buy an iPod when I have the money so I won't be out at the CD store every weekend
-Read more, Talk less
-Think more, Speak critically
-Get my hand fixed, and allow it to heal properly
-Watch what I eat, and never drink anything besides Water, or Fruit Juices
-When I eat, try to consume Organic foods
-KEEP UP TO MY WORD, and MY RESPONSIBILITIES
-Completely eliminate the word ""sorry"" away from my vocabulary, instead I shall make it clear to whoever I've done wrong, that I'm aware of my actions, and I'm aware of my consequences; ""Show N' Prove""
-Try to live in Reality, and by Truth, try to never Lie no matter what, and accept consequences and punishments, attempt to learn from my mistakes
-Let down my emotional guard... and become more vulnerable to people around me...
-Give the Females in my life more attention; and remember that if I want to win a girls heart, the only way to do so is giving them my undivided attention... To do so; I must focus my eyesight in only ONE pupil, because focusing on both pupils, is IMPOSSIBLE... Focusing on one pupil allows me to better understand, as well as communicate freely with the person I am tuned with...
-Write down my thoughts when I feel they hold significance
-Work on my performance in every scenerio; the little details make the biggest difference...
-Find more hobbies
-Try and to learn and master every situation that I come across, and stop asking others to do it for me...
-When I can... Give to the people who Need, and Receive when I am the people who need, always show my appreciation
-Keep what I know to myself
-Keep my spiritual values inside
-Keep my knowledge towards life inside; and learn to stear my life with that knowledge

Well this is more than I can handle, and I'm sure I won't keep up to a lot of these, but at this moment, these are all of the qualities that I feel need to be persued in the year of 2005...

Lots of things have been happening in my life lately, but I just don't have the time or motivation to get it down on this thing... I will try to update more often, so I can help and better myself by organizing my thoughts... I'm done trying to prove shit to people, or trying to impress people, or trying to make people like me, or trying to be ultimately accepted by the people around me... I got to accept myself before I am accepted by people around me; and that is only going to happen when I put thought, work, faith, and quality in whatever I do, whenever I do it... For now? I am satisfied with my status... My whole body aches from carrying 40 pound tiles and fitting them in sand for my mothers boyfriend... I am getting payed for my work, and when that happens I got to remember to be generous. I've been active for the past couple of days, and productively active. I helped my mother clean 3 Huge houses today for only 30 Dollars, my intention was not the profit, but to help my mother out; the profit came with the blessing of the feeling that I got when realized I made life a little easier for somebody...

You can say I'm egocentric; but when it comes down to it I'm just trying to give myself the credit that I deserve and the significance that it holds to my mind...

This is a start at repairing what could have been; Now all I can do is keep on going and feed off my Progress...

Peace to The GOD!
Peace to my Family!
Peace to Caleb; I love you, know that... You're the only person that I've respectively called father... I hope for nothing but good health, and happiness to your future... 
Peace to whoever else cares!"

"event","The Christmas Season...

Supposed to be the season of giving, caring, love, manifestation, and just an over all cheerful time of the year...

But instead we get Greed... Excessive money spending on gifts, blinding the people from the true significance of the Holiday and why we celebrate it... 

Instead we get the deaths of over 60,000 people killed in a matter of minutes...
And with this devastating event, people have the nerves to go around begging for money as a ""organization"" to support the survivors... You want to support the survivors? Why not send them food? Boxes of Canned foods? Bags of Rice? Potatoes? Meat..? 

I was reading this guys livejournal, and he was talking about this new law that allowed people to give gift certificates to the organization so they can cash it back in for money, and with the money they will ""support"" the survivors... You expect me to believe some bullshit like that? 

I find it so ironic how the deaths in Iraq increase right along with the deaths of 60,000 other Muslims...

Arafat dies, from a mysterious unknown cause, in a French Military Hospital... Arafat survived for years in his headquarters while being bombed... He decides to die in a fuckin French Hospital? Oh wait, he didn't get a decision he just died in his sleep... 

As people remain in shock with this devastating event; they fail to recognize the increase of corruption in the world because they are still thinking about the Tsunami... The Governer in Iraq assasinated, by unknown... Osama Bin Laden sends in a new Video? EXTACY is on the verge of being fuckin legalized in the U.S.?

The NASA plans all of a sudden back in effect?

THE FDA LEGALIZING DEATH!?

Holy shit, living in this world today the air I breath doesn't even feel pure anymore... I look at the night sky I can't even spot the stars like I used to... What stops me from believing that HUMANS themselves caused this devastating Tsunami? NOTHING... What stops me from believing HUMANS are responsible for all these Hurricanes we've been having? NOTHING... Shit, they could set off bombs in the deep oceans causing enough pressure to set off Earthquakes leading to Tsunamis... Shit, they could even cause enough pressure in our atmosphere to set off Hurricanes... 

and to add on to my anger with this unperfect world... My stepfather, the only father figure I've ever had, is in a hospital with half of his body paralyzed, deaf and blind on one side of his face, while he decides to take a Christmas vacation in order to cope with the stressful life he has to deal with working 3 jobs at the age of 59, trying to provide for his son while he can, and trying to improve a society with nothing but good intentions in his heart... Good People don't deserve this... People like this man, went into the jungles and managed to help raise a city to industrial status, in order to be acknowledged by the rest of the world! People like this man, go in jails and change the lives of 3 time felons as a prison teacher... risking his life... People like this man have the balls to be a man and try to do positive deeds in life instead of these monstreous acts that the government is onto now adays... Why do they deserve shit like this? I don't understand man... I'm so scared... I don't wanna lose him... at first I didn't take it so seriously... But now I've realized he could die... I just wish God would not give me a reason to be angry, and spare his relatives the pain and grief...

It's sickening... I can't believe all the bloodshed and devastation and corruption can take place on such a highly celbrated holiday season..."

That's me pulling off the rainbow all 3 times... but the first one was a lacker... not as good as I usually pull it off, but the other two are flawless, for those of you who don't know what a rainbow is in soccer, it's where your running with the ball and jump infront of it while its still moving real fast, and pick the ball up with both of your heels while its still rolling fast on your heels, then you catapult the ball over your head and your opponents heads with your left heel; if you can pull this move off in a game it's fuckin crazy... you can catapult over goalies, over a whole defense set up if your smart enough, I havent pulled it off in a game yet, but i'm sure I can, I'll make it 1 of my goals to pull it off during soccer season, I've been practicing hard man... I know I'll do it...

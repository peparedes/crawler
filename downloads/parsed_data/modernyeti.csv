<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>15<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>14<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>15<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>15<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>15<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>16
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>Lawful Good</b> A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. He combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. He tells the truth, keeps his word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion. However, lawful good can be a dangerous alignment because it restricts freedom and criminalizes self-interest.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Paladins</b> take their adventures seriously, and even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to learn tactics, and to find ways to do good. Divine power protects these warriors of virtue, warding off harm, protecting from disease, healing, and guarding against fear. The paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing wounds or curing diseases, and also use it to destroy evil. Experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead. A paladin's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast. Many of the paladin's special abilities also benefit from a high Charisma score.

"event","So, there's the high school dream.  The reason it's cliche is most people have them.  My dream always starts the same.

It's the second semester of school, and it's time for finals.  Problem is, I have no fucking clue where my finals are.  Seriously, none.  Mainly cause I've never been to class.  So I have to run around the damn school praying that I'll find my class in time.  Mainly cause it's senior year, and my class hasn't graduated.  Turns out somehow everything got screwed up and we only THOUGHT we graduated.  And despite not having gone to class, I'm fairly sure I'll be fine as long as I can bullshit the exam.

Then it variates from there.  Sometimes the others are androids.  Sometimes they're brainwashed.  Hell, once a demon popped in with a leather jacket like he was fuckin' Fonzie or some shit.  And then I wake up."

"event","Wow, so I suppose we've all heard about the Micheal 'Cosmo Kramer' Richards tyrade.  If not, just google it and click the news entry.  You'll find the video soon enough.  I talked about it with my mom today, and man...  She's just not crazy about the black folk.  I found myself saying things like ""you know, they have the vote now, right?""  ""It's not acceptable to call them negro's anymore.""  Or, my personal favorite ""we can drink from the same water fountains now.""

I have no real point to this, especially since you can google just about every opinion on racism and prejudice that's ever existed.

Also, the school bus thing...  I have nothing.  I heard about it and went ""damn.  That sucks.  What's for dinner?""  As it turns out... I don't know any of the people in the wreck.  Hell, all the people I knew from school finally graduated last year.  So....  Yeah....

Osu!  Tatakae!  Ouendan is fun.  Hard.  Damned hard.  Damned fun.  Just put asside some extra cash to buy a new DS when you throw your's against the wall cause of Ready Steady Go (yes, the full metal alachamest theme)."

I'm not going to list the details of my birthday, but let's just put it as surreal. Yes, surreal sounds sarcastic enough.

I'm currently in a new D&D game. Soulknives are fun.

I have a DS Lite, which I acquired for my date of birth. My dad has played it more than I have. Seriously. That has changed now, due to him buying his OWN DS Lite. His is white, mine is black. How cute.

Wasn't it bad enough that you had Governor Arnold as an energy drink spokesman?  Didn't you do enough harm when you made a former NFL player into a number one pop star?  Do you think the world will ever recover from your country being the backfrop for Bill Murray's comeback movie?  Japan, stop drinking your water.  It's laced with something.  Instead, import.  It not only helps the world's economy, you could also use a drink of something that won't cause you to come up with new tenticle porn OAVs."

"event","Well, now I know why everyone always talks about World of Warcraft.  It's actually kind of fun.  Some of the finer details still alude me, like how to jump, but that's beside the point.  Also some tard dueled me four times.  In a row.  He said I won the first three cause I was invisible due to me being a rogue.  So I killed him the fourth time while not invisible.  He didn't say a damn thing afterwards and left.  That was funny as hell."

"event","Well, kids.  Here's an update of my life so far.  

I've got a pretty boring job working security.  I sit and do nothing for 8 - 10 hours while getting paid.  It's not hard at all and if I'm not careful I might get a bit of excercise out of it.

I've gotten my hands on some pretty good live action, including a bad ass show called Garo.  Also, I'm subtitling the Initial D movie by myself.  Might even pick up some chinese outta this.

I watched Kung Fu Hustle.  Bad ass little film, but I actually liked Shaolin Soccer better.  Still, worth a purchase and DEFINATELY worth the rental.

I asked out a girl recently.  Everything seems to be going well with that, inspite of her being married and all.  That one hit me outta left field, man.

And, finally, I'm hanging out with Laura tomorrow.  Oh what wacky hijinks will insue.

Whelp, that's all.  I'll leave you crazy cats and kittens alone.  Later."

"event","I notice a whole heapin' mess of people doing ""what I'm thankful for"" posts.  Well, I'm not gonna.  Not out of protest, but not out of lazyness either.  

And it's not that I don't have stuff to be thankful for.  It's just that people have gotten pretty deep with their posts on the subject.  While I respect that, I refuse to go that path as it's really mostly stuff that's my buisiness.  Whole lotta in-jokes that are best left in, you know?  At the sametime, I'm not gonna go with the shallow ""I'm thankful Capcom released Resident Evil and the Classics collection"" type stuff.  Sure, I likes me some games, but that makes the occassion feel cheapened.  

I could go into the whole ""white man killed the red man"" type of rant, but really I never was conscious enough in history to give an account.  I'll leave that for Christina (indian) or Eric (history 'buff').  

I could go through the trouble, like Lira, of associating songs with most of you...  That takes a whole lot of time in explaining why and, honestly, I like listening to my music.  Assosciating songs is something I promised myself I'd never do again, as it's the perfect recipe for angst later on down the line.  

So, when it comes down to it, I'm thankful for things and if I choose to let you know what those things are, I'll let you.  Anyway, back to FireFly.  

Later kiddies.  

Oh, and as a PS...  I got digits today.  Awesome like a possum.  

Peace out.

And thanks for reading this post, buggers."

"event","Now, I know a lot of people won't believe this, but I actually like the Parappa the Rappa anime.  Actually, lately I've been up for ANYTHING that's not overly depressing or focusing on uninteresting and nonexisting plot *coughTenTencough* and tend to go for a light hearted comedy.  Parappa just doesn't have a plot.

However, I do bring shows that have really fantastic plots, wonderful writing, and beautiful visual shots...  Then they get shot down due to being mecha, live action, or the fact that I brought them (yes, I've heard things.)  See, stuff like that gets on my nerves.  ""But Ben, you make fun of our stuff mercilessly.""  Yeah, usually when I hear things like ""Dear god, please vote for this so we don't have to watch any of the other stuff on here.""  Now, granted, there are usually other things on the list by other people...  BUT THIS WAS SAID WHEN MY STUFF WAS THE ONLY THINGS THERE BESIDES ONE FRIGGIN' THING!!!

Then again, why am I ranting?  I barely even go to HAAS anymore...  Well, who said I was talking about HAAS?  Ok, apparently I said it...  But that's besides the point!  Personally, I believe you need to watch at least five episodes of a tv series before you know if it's good or not.  Usually.  Like, say, Kamen Rider Blade.  The first few episodes weren't all that great.  Then, all of a sudden, it had these very well written plot arcs, and ended in a way that I couldn't have expected but can't see ending any other way (until I see the movie.)

Another instance is Initial D.  The first few episodes were kinda not good...  Just the standard ""oh gee, wonder if he's gonna wi-yeah, he won..."" stuff.  The plot took off after that.  So I've been told.  I can't really get my hands on Initial D cause I hate having to hear aboout how awesome it is.  I'm borrowing it, I bought your lies, I know you think it's bad ass...  STOP TALKING!!

Honestly though, I just finished watching Excel Saga...  After god knows how many years...  I finally finished it...  And I managed to find the missing gags in the 24th episode.  It was hidden under the mat in Ali Baba's Bathroom.  Anyone who knows that reference (except Neil) will get a pack of cookies.  I am not fucking kidding.  I say except Neil cause I know he knows.  We still watch the show!!

After watching old episodes of You Can't Do That On Television, I honestly believe people should be slimed everytime you say I Don't Know or get water poured on them when you say water.  ""Hey, you need a bath.""

""Oh, ok.  Water.""  ::splash::  ""Wee!!  singing in the bathtuuuuuub!!!""

By the way, my predition for two posts earlier came true.  I also didn't get to do much of anything for April Fool's Day.  Seriously.  Didn't do anything for Saint Patrick's Day either.  Hell, I don't even do much for anything.  Although on July 7th I expect to be in Pennsylvania in a LOOOOONNNNNNNNNG line while Lira and her girlfriend do....  things....  I'm not sure what things, but things nonetheless.

And by the way, what the fuck is up?  Lira gets a girlfriend, Neil got..... laid.  Am I the ONLY person who didn't wind up with more than their fist this weekend!?  Actually, that's not bitching.  I just use that line every chance I can get cause I think it's hilarious.

But back to the original reason for this post...  It's currently 6:14 AM and I have to be up in four hours to attend a game...  FOUR HOURS!?  HOLY SHIT!!!  Sleep it is!

IT was unbeliavable!  And now I'm saddened because I doubt that tomorrow's anal offerings can not live up to the hype of today's massive fecal sacrifice.  However, when offering at the porceline altar, one must always try to give their best.  So tonight, bean burritos followed milk and deviled eggs.  I must be able to constantly top myself lest I never be number one.

In other words, I took a shit and it stunk.  I plan on taking another stinky one tomorrow.  Feel free to post comments.

Oh, and on a completely unrelated note (seriously, I nearly forgot to mention this and it has nothing to do with stool at all) Tokusou Sentai DekaRanger tai Abaranger is hilarious.

Call me crazy or call me desperate for cash, I'm willing to cook for you.  Tell me how you want it, what ingridients you want in the merinade, and what sides you want.  Prices start at around $7 a plate.  Also works well for parties.

(P.S. Seven bucks is around the cost needed for the steak plus materials needed for the rest of the dinner.  Seriously, I've had to do this math before.  There is, of course, a group discount.)"

Rules:
a. Pick one dozen movies that are ones that you have special feelings about.
b. Pick a few lines of dialogue.
c. As people guess the film, strike out that entry.
d. After the film is guessed, explain why that movie made the list.

<s>3.)  ""Prince Kenshin, you must return to the castle!""</s> Guessed by <lj user=""howielove2101"">

And now for part d.
1.)  My favorite movie of all time, and it's a film that I have yet to sit in a room and not hear people quote when they watch it.  It's also the first film WGN showed when they abandoned the WB.
2.)  I liked TMNT 2.  Come on, Keno was cool.
3.)  The movie was hilarious... when I grew up.  The other quote I was gonna use was ""How did you get into April's pants?""
4.)  Bill & Ted's Excellant Adventure was kick ass, is kick ass, and will forver remain to kick ass.
5.)  Ethan Randall is the man.
6.)  Masters of the Universe movie.  Skeletor when he absorbs the powers of Greyskull.
7.)  Another film that I haven't found anyone who doesn't like it.
8.)  Spider-Man.  'Nuff said.
9.)  Everyone loves Army for one reason or another.  Well, everyone who's seen it at least.
10.) Bill & Ted rule.
11.) Mortal Kombat the movie.  The action was fast paced, at the time, and it was a decent film.  Sure, it completely ignored the backstory for Scorpion and Sub Zero, but the backstory could have still been there sinc they were brainwashed."

"event","Hrmmm...  ok, this is probably gonna be a stress reliever post.  Be warned.  Ok, I've noticed disturbing trends in my current life that are very closely ressembling the last time things turned to shit.  ""And bickety bam, the motherfucker is rubble.""  So if I dissappear that means that one of four things are happening.

A.) Building a proverbial bomb shelter to wait things out.
B.) I'm trying to get things over with individually so they don't come at me all together.
C.) I managed to difuse the situation.
D.) Everything went to hell.  Again.

Now then, this is the only lj post I'll make on the subject due to the fact that documenting things didn't help me at all last time.  This time, I'm going to try things differently.  If things continue, I might have to bail out of the comic.  That seems to be the common thread."

After about three hours I finally did it.  Then, I went upstairs to go to the next bomb...  And there I saw little ledges I could have dropped down off of...  Anyway, now I'm playing Suikoden IV.  Ah, Konami...  You've found ways to rule my life without your music games.  Oh, and Viewtiful Joe 2 rocks."

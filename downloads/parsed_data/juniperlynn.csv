"event","Mike got laid off today. how shitty is that? i mean, we could barely get by on what he was making with his hours getting cut back, and now... well, obviously that means i have to suck it up and get a freakin job. i guess its motivation enough, though, so in a way thats good. he needs a better job. now he has the chance to look. i'm trying to look at things a little more positively, its kinda working. and at least they waited till the end of the pay period, so he wouldnt be getting another check for a few weeks anyhow. gives us time to get our shit together, if we both find jobs, we can make twice as much in a shorter amount of time, meaning we wouldnt have to panic so much all the time about how we are going to pay for things. and hell, i told him if we can both get jobs, we can pay off our bed and get a big screen and a computer and pay at the same time. i dont want to push it, though, so we'll see how things go. we have to get ourselves out of debt, too. anyhow, i'm hella tired, gonna crash. umm... yeah."

"event","issues. lots of them. ok, not lots, but a few. enough to make me question myself right now. i'm confusing the hell out of myself, and probably whoever so chooses to read this. and unfortunately, i cant even explain whats happening. lets just say i made an error in judgement and now i'm dealing with the emotional consequences. not even sure if it isnt just all in my head. my way of making drama out of the little nothings in my life. whatever it is, its really fucking with me. i cant tell which end is up. i cant figure out if what i think and what i feel is real or if i'm reading too deep into things. i'm acting a little stupid, maybe even a little obsessive. what the hell is wrong with me? i guess mostly i just need to start thinking before i act. i cant seem to do that, and it gets me into trouble all the time. thats ok, it doesnt even matter what i am really feeling anyway. because nothing is going to change. at least not in this situation. fucking life."

"event","today wasnt too bad. slept till 1. of course i didnt go to bed until 4 or 5... went to rebekah's and immediately got dragged off to the pet store. then helped her set up her fish tank, because some people are incapable of reading directions. she, and the man who gave her the tank, were bother convinced that a 45 gallon tank was going to require 45 gallons of water.... /sigh. so i convinced her to ""start"" with 30, since she was buying gallons of distilled water at the store. knowing, of course, that she would use less than that. i was right. 22 gallons. love being right. anyhow, then tonight roomie took us to denny's for dessert, that was nice. saw noah there. knew he wouldnt talk to me. i was right. in fact, i even predicted that he was there. think he's gonna be mad at me for awhile. i think he's more hurt than anything, really. i mean, everything i said had to be said. i couldnt play games anymore. not that i ever meant to, but if that was how he felt, then everything had to be out. i still feel bad i hurt him. oh well. so today was ok. i got through it. kept my irritation level at a minimum. spent time around people. got out of the house. very seldom do i do those three things all in one day, lol. ok i'm done, night."

"event","went to friends house when she got off work. i only stayed for a little while, cuz i was tired and i sort of have a tendency to run out of patience for people very quickly. came home, called stephen (another, not so annoying, friend) and he's drunk, tells me to come over. so i leave, planning only to be there a short while. get there, go in, and i dont know a single person in the living room, but there are only like 4 ppl there, hehe. stand there for a sec, looking at the tv, pretending to be interested, to belong. someone asks me if i am looking for stephen(i find out later his name is david, or dave) oh, and if you are reading this, i am still drunk, so pay no mind, but the backspace is my friend tonight :-) anyway, he is outside, so i go out back and find that there, everyone knows me, lol. mike(my really really good friend), his bro joey, sean, and stephen. i immediately get called over by mike, much to my relief (i fit in!) to take a shot of his jager, cuz no one else will. of course i do, i'm cool like that, hehe. random shit, kinda meet a few ppl. one guy (shane?) was on front porch, head over the side, puking for about 2 hours. i got him water and tissues, and made sure he was alive every now and again (his friends finally got him up and on the futon, with a big rubbermaid tote at his side). then more random shit, a little drama, joey getting rambunctious... i guess thats just joey though. i was kinda picking at him, but i think he got mad at me. whatever, he's got issues. insecure men who cant take someone playing around, think they have to get violent all the time. anyhow, get to that later. random drama with sean and a few of stephens pals about shane(?). then mike has a ""quiet"" talk with stephen about his friends... we were all sitting in the living room listening, lol. one guy, ben, was trying to make matters worse by pointing out to the other friend that he was being talked about. thank GOD the guy was totally oblivious, then some other random misconception happened and ben decided it wasnt about.. oh yeah vince, after all. (it was) so more randomness. was getting ready to leave and joey decides to start shit with me. well, if someone wants to flip me shit, i sure as hell am gonna flip it right back. its up to them to decide whether or not its friendly. joey decided it wasnt. and he did it in front of mike. (idiot) joey may be mike brother, but mike considers me his sister. mike was getting upset, i kept telling joey to just walk away. mike told him to quit being stupid. joey starts talking about how he is gonna hit me and knock out my jaw, blah blah blah dentures blah blah blah. i just keep telling him its not gonna happen, now quit being dumb and walk away. he starts telling mike, ""oh i'm sorry, i didnt mean to make fun of the part down syndrome person"" (moron) which pisses me off even more. god i really wanted to hit him. so bad. and mike could tell. he was getting ready for it. i could see it. he was already regretting that he was gonna have to kick his brothers ass. so FINALLY joey walks away to talk shit about me to sean. i hug mike and tell him its ok, i'm ignoring it, and i get him to come with me to talk to stephen. we sit and hug and chat, saying we miss each other, planning to chat before he leaves, random stuff, anything to make him not think about his brother or any other madness. it works. then i leave before his brother can come back inside and ruin things. and here i am. home. yay. night :-)"

"event","Aside from the fact i have only been up for an hour, today has been ok so far. generally i can tell how a day is gonna go for me within the first half hour. i'm either cranky or i'm not, and that makes all the difference. more wierd, long, elaborate dreams last night. been having them a lot in the past few months, at least every other night. always running from something/someone. still trying to figure that out. for a long time i was having these dreams where i would be running, and i couldnt run fast enough, so i would have to use the ground or other things around me to propel myself. started to think maybe this has to do with my lack of walking since i got a car. used to walk everywhere. no joke. to walk from one end of the city to the other was nothing to me but a little time. and time well spent, at that. not only was i excercising, but i had time to clear my head. i was a lot happier then, because i had so much time alone with my thoughts. i was able to work out my frustrations without boring anyone else, or hurting anyone else. i miss it. and now mike has my car all the time, so you would think i would start walking again. regretfully, the only distance i have walked has been about a block (across a field) about 3 times in the past week. and i loved it each time. i wished i had farther to go, or nothing to do, because i would have kept walking and walking. soon. i will break out of this funk and start walking again, and that in turn will break me further out of my depression. i think. i hope."

"event","Today was a bad day for that chick in the back of my head. i'm not even going to say what happened exactly, but lets say she came unglued. i came unglued. however you want to say it, it happened. maybe its unhealthy for me to start referring to her in the third person, an extension of myself. i mean, she is me, right? but i find it hard to accept that i do the things she does. i cant accept that, and so i have disowned that part of me. isnt that how it starts? or did she start that way? another side, born of years of abuse in so many ways, born of drug use and stress, and my inability to cope with it all? maybe its more probable to say i am making excuses for myself. thats what my mom would tell me. thats what she has always told me. i think thats what her mom always told her. grandma's a bit nutso. for that matter, mom's nuts too. ok i had more to ramble, but i think i lost it..."

"event","So, I have decided it might be a good idea to start keeping a journal again. Maybe help me keep my thoughts straight. And this way, i can share it, so maybe someone will give me a new perspective. Anyhow, how do i begin?

I'm frightened a lot lately. scared that i'm sick, physically and otherwise. i know i need to see a doctor, but i'm not sure what keeps me from it more... the lack of money to pay for it, or the fear of something being seriously wrong. i always used to tell myself that if there were symptoms of things wrong with me, i wouldnt let it go, i would get it checked out. now i find myself putting it off, telling myself the same thing everyone else told me for so many years. that i am overreacting. that i am creating things that arent really there, and magnifying the things that are. but, really, i dont think i am. i have been getting migraines lately. sometimes worse than others, and sometimes much worse. i think a lot of it has to do with the pot. and i know i need to quit, regardless. its just that i feel like with all the things fucked up in my head and in my body, i have to do something to keep it all together. to bring me back to peace. i know its not the right way, but right now its my way. but thats beside the point.

Then there is my head. a lot of the time, like when i get emotional, i feel like i take a backseat to some other side of me. its like she sits in the back, watching, seething, getting angry for me while i stand there and smile and pretend not to be upset, not to care. then one day, she snaps right out of me, ripping forward, shoving me aside, and wreaking havoc upon my world. she terrifies me. she is capable of saying all those things i try so hard to keep inside. of doing the things that i cant for fear of hurting myself, or someone, or something... and lately she has been making her visits more frequent. so i smoke more, trying to keep her quiet, docile, controllable. and i run out faster, and we dont have money, so during the downtime she rears her ugly head. i know her name. its a name i swore would never apply to me. i cant even say it yet. but its there. repeating itself in the back of my mind, all day and all night. haunting me. and i cant believe that its true. all these years of being so good. so damn good. not touching all the things i knew could reel me in. watching in disgust as everyone else was taken in by all those horrible needs. the things they did to feed the habit. and i guess i imagined myself better than that.

i guess i pretended that mine was the lesser evil, and so it became no evil at all. boy am i stupid."

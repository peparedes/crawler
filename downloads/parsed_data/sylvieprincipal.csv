"event","New Writing...I just had an urge to express how I'm feeling...not very good but maybe you'll get the gist.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div text=""Usako 1"" class=""ljcut"">USAKO<br /><br />Author- SylviePrincipal<br /><br />Summary- Usagi is sick. And no one notices....or is it that they just don't care.<br /><br /><i>'God Usagi! Can't you even control yourself?!'<br /><br />'You're such a pig!'<br /><br /></i>There had been a time when she really wouldn't have cared when they said things like that...but now the words strike too deeply and every jab only caused her to retreat deeper into herself. Usagi rested her sweaty brow to the tile on the bathroom floor, golden hair pooling around her. Her entire body trembled from the shock of purging, a natural response she reassured herself softly.<br /><br />Sitting up finally, she stumbled over to the scale, hesitating for only a second before stepping onto it. Usagi clenched her eyes shut, not wishing to show herself the extent of her gluttony. But determined, the cerulean colored eyes opened to peer at the digital numbers portrayed above her toes.<br /><br />The reincarnated moon princess promptly yelped and felt the familiar burn of tears welling behind her eyes. She had hoped that Makoto's specially made snack for her hadn't been that bad...but Usagi knew that the damage was already done. She had eaten those horribly disgusting, delicious cakes and no amount of purging would ever rid her of the nutrients her stomach had selfishly absorbed.<br /><br />106.9<br /><br />The number blinked out of existence as she stepped off and turned to the mirror instead.<br /><br />She heard the words of her friends and loved ones echo in her mind. Accusing her of the horrible crimes she had committed. It was a miracle that Mamoru even looked at her still. Usagi frowned, hands clenching as rage rushed through her frame. In that moment she hated herself more than she ever had before. The too round face staring back at her causes chills to roll down Usagi's back. Utterly worthless.<br /><br /><br /><br />-----------<br />AN Just a short Prologue. Im thinking this will be a short one. Maybe only 5 chapters long? Anyways. More to come!!<br /><br /><br /></div>"

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Chapter 8--MISSING"">Missing<br /><br />Chapter 8<br /><br />Author- sylvieprincipal<br /><br />Disclaimer- No Naruto and its characters don't belong to me.<br />----<br /><br />Itachi, by nature, was a patient man.He was also incredibly lazy and always seemed to wait until the last minute to inform his partner of his plans. Kisame didn't mind so much as long as it didn't get him killed. But he did wonder why they did many of the things that they did...Like checking up on the youngest Uchiha every so often...Sasuke, of course, never knew of this. And Kisame was sure the Itachi-mini would be pissed as hell if he did.<br /><br />They still had orders though, and that was the most pressing matter for Kisame at the moment. The fox brat was yet to be found and apparently he had been missing from Konoha for nearly a month and a half. His partner was not acting worried in the least.<br /><br />In fact they were on his younger brothers trail at that very moment, Itachi leading the way.<br /><br />""What about Naruto?"" Kisame didn't like questioning the Uchiha often and did so hesitantly. Despite being a seasoned and cold-blooded killer those sharingan eyes scared the shit out of him.<br /><br />Said eyes looked back at him from underneath dark bangs. Itachi smothered a smirk when he saw Kisame pale visibly, if it was possible for his blue partner.<br /><br />""If we follow my little brother,"" the brother was said with mocking affection. ""he will lead us straight to our Naruto-kun. So keep up Kisame, unless you want to be lost.""<br /><br />Kisame growled mentally at the last snarky comment.<br /><br />Just how was it that he had ended up paired with the cold, mentally-unstable genius anyways?<br /><br />-----<br /><br />If the sight before him was causing chills to crawl over his skin, Kakashi hesitated to think what it gave Sasuke. The dilapidated mansion loomed ahead of them, seeming to swallow the remaining daylight the closer they got. <br /><br />Reaching the perimeter, all Sasuke wanted to do was turn tail and run back to the safety of Konoha and his home. But there was a good chance that Naruto was in there...or at least a clue to the blonds whereabouts.<br /><br />The Uchiha felt a moment of blind panic come over him as they reached the perimeter but&nbsp; shrugged it off quickly. He was no longer a child, and he refused to run from his past. Gritting his teeth Sasuke waited for his cue.<br /><br />----<br /><br />AN- eheh cliffy...yes I have left quite a lot of those recently....maybe I'm complicating this a little too much. *shrug* I'll explain it all later...its gonna take a while *grin* I was really annoyed. I had this entire chapter, longer mind you, written and ready to post....it was much better also. And I was so tired that i accidentally deleted it....*sigh* i'm having such a hard time lately.<br /><br /></div>"

"event","i havent written in this for like a week. things have been going kinda crappy. i guess thats the best way of putting it. my aunt died over the weekend which really sucked alot. so i missed school on tuesday to go to the funeral. when i got back on wednesday i found out everyone had seen their grades for their finals except me. so i asked my teachers and they kept saying talk to me later and yet they never showed me my grades. o well. im pretty sure i did ok atleast. the week went by fast so i guess thats good seeing as it is the weekend again. altho it seems alot of my friends are going through rough times which sux. i'll try my best to help them out but i guess i can interfere to much."

"event","Shit! finals start tomorrow and lucky me my worst class is my first final i take. this really sux. i am not ready at all. and frankly i dont seem to care ne more. i hate school and acedemics and all that shit. but if i fail the finals the parents will be pretty upset. so all in all im screwed. o well. i was wishing today would have been an ICE DAY but i cant get that lucky. mother nature doesnt seem to care too much for me right now for various reasons. i dont really care though. we didnt do ne thing today in school. it was pretty much a waste of 5 1/2 hours which i would've rather been spending sleeping or maybe even studying. but again i dont really care."

"event","Jesus Christ! its already sunday. it feels like the weekend just started and now its gone. i did nothing this weekend that really appealed to me so basically this weekend was a waste. i didnt even study for finals which are this week. damn it! i hate studying and i hate even more studying for something important that will efect my grade. i have also been in a grumpy mood lately b/c i havent had a good night sleep since X-mas break. also i think i have insomnia b/c i cant go to sleep at all. o well. i really only two days of school this week and one day is a shortend day. so i guess i dont feel all that crappy. altho finals will be hell for me."

"event","O GOD! its saturday and i had to wake up at 8:00 to help take down X-mas lights for people who couldn't do it. it sucked ass pretty much. my fingers were freazing cold and i got frost bite on my toes. after i got back i had pizza for lunch. it was alright. extremely greasy but it was good. after that i went to a friends house to help him make a public service anouncement (PSA) movie about date rape. not the most happiest subject, but this kid's amazing at directing and filming. so it turned out alright. finally i came home and found out my parents bought a new refrigerater and new washer and dryer. i was like ""WTF!"" cause nothing was wrong with the first ones and plus where do we have the money to pay for them. they are kinda stylish though for being wat they are. so i guess i could care less. now its 5:40 and i have nothing to do. DAMN IT!"

"event","WOW! i finally made a live journal. i took me like an hour to set it up and the acctual link sux ass, but hey i acctually did something useful for myself. i guess i should descibe my day since thats wat journals are about. lets see, i woke up dead tired and wanted to kill someone or something just to get some more sleep. then i thought ""hey its friday. I've only got one more freaking day left of this week."" so i went. as unhappy as i was to go, i went. school blowed. except for health class b/c we watched a hilarious movie on AIDS. other than that school sucked. i really only go to see friends now. except im getting alright grades, which doesnt make sense because i dont try in any class anymore. after school i came home and did absolutly nothing for four hours. then i had dinner. pasta! shit yea! that cheered me up a bit. then i did nothing for another 2 hours. then after being convinced to start a live journal i made one. take a minute to look at my lj link. its a piece of crap and it stinks like vaginal secreations (no pun intended). o well at least i got one now."

"event","Well, I'm at writing camp right now, I'm working on a piece that I made not too long ago and so I'm just kinda waiting for aproval from the Instructors. Here was the first draft, I'll show you all the good draft when it's published in the anthology.

Veil Twixt Life and Death

What of you my dearest friend, I stand and watch as your life ends, and as I see I wish it had been me. I should have been in front of you, standing there, disrupt his view. I should not have gone looking for you, your face now sitting dead before you, and as I look I wonder what I'd done. And now your body gracefully, standing now against a tree, the killer lying dead against the ground. Your head regrows and you walk away, say ""Have a care, don't die today."" And now I wonder what would happen, if I had been in the way"

"event","My summer vacation. (cars screech and crash nearby)um...yeah. seems kinda like that. I had a good couple of first days, Spring fest, D&D, hangin' with friends, missing others, and over all being buisy. Then, one night, as the fog drifted ofer the mountain...ok, not really, but late one night I tried to stay up and go online but as soon as I pulled away from the screen to look at my new kitten, biting my toes and all, my eyes started to ache. A few days later I got a headache and in the end, my nails had turned bluish, like from methane.
Mom finally listened when I told her about the nails and brought me to a doctor, the first Sunday of my vacation. The doctor looked me over, asked me a few questions, and sent me to the hospital. This is when I was having major chills, like it-felt-like-winter-and-I-forgot-my-jacket type chills, and we're in the already cold waiting room. My teeth were literally chattering. We were there for about 15 minuets before the people would let us in for a few questions before sending me to the ER. ""ER?"" I was thinking, ""Why do I need to go to the ER? Is it warm?"" Anywho, I got there and before I could even sit down they took my clothes off (most of them, not all) and put the gown on me. So here I am, freezing my butt off and they put a thin piece of cloth between me and the cruel, cold world and that didn't help much. Thankfully, I got my shivering form into the bed and my mom covered me in blankets.
Then my favorite people came in! The vampires. They're not quite vamps 'cause they don't really drink the stuff, but the blood drawers are pretty damn close. The two times I got my blood drawn and the IV put in my arm, I puked a total of three times. Despite popular opinion, I HATE needles.  They hooked me up as I passed out because at that time it was about 1:30-tired PM and we had been here since about 6:05-crappy AM.
I woke up an hour later with liquids being pumped into my arm and light from the roof pouring into my eyes. They turned them off after my mom asked and I was incredibly thankfull of that. Later, they came in, two radiologists. I was going to get a spinal tap and the pain from that I cannot describe. I could feel exactly how deep, the needled were going into my spine and I could feel them trying to get the fluids but in all, from both attempts, they got three drops of fluid. I went to sleep again. I woke up later as they were moving me to my room for the next three days. They gave me a package of anutibiotics in my IV and moved out. I got a winnie the pooh room, not that I cared much, and also a phone and TV. I stayed there for the next three days being diagnosed for a disease that I could barely pronounce and can't spell. I got it from a tic. More blood tests were done, horrible food was given to me, and once my dad and step mom got there, they had an ""who can embarass Beren the most with the toys in the gift shop"" contest and really it was bad...I later left the toys for future patients to enjoy. I had kore blood tests and finally, two days ago (or was it three) my white blood cells and platelets went up so I could leave. The nurses I can say were wonderfull and frankly, the nights weren't so quiet, but I won't get into that.
Just wanted to let you guys know what was going on if you hadn'y heard,

"event","I'm starting to write my first short story, though I will not be posting my progress here...(theft is ever so common). Still, I just got done doing scheduling with my guidance counselor on wed and I needed another credit so I'm taking Japanese 1 as well as French 3. -_-;;   I'll find a way to survive...hopefully. I actually have been keeping up with my friends here but nothing in my world seemed to really matter that much. Grandma & Grandpa sent me a picture of Dad, Grandpa, and myself and I'm kinda in awe. My hair SUCKED and I never really knew that I was that tall (only reason I fit in pic is because I was slouching). Went to the city last weekend with my DM and his dad to help fix up an apartment of theirs and get some D&D in. John (DM) gave me kudos for my first dungeon, although I'm still trying to get the face to face RPing down...If all my D&D scenarios were typed I would probably do better but, alas, they are not. Thanks Dad for inspiration on this one for all of your stories and mentioning the illusionist wizardry class. It gave me so many ideas. :D Any who, I gotta go finish my online stuff for the next week as I'm going to a FALO gather tomorrow and Terence and I have a bet that if I last for a week without going online, he would give me a briefcase. Gotta set everything up for that.
until my next entry,

"event","so i just got back from my caribbean (sp?) cruise. it was sick. i met tons of cool americans (omgzz what a shock, EH?)... apart from them making fun of how i say ""eh,"" ""about,"" and ""out,"" shit was coo'. i've come to realize, though, that travelling with grandparents is a PAIN. LOL@that shit, and i love them, but come onnnnnnnnnnnn.. stop BITCHING about everything.. you got the trip for free, so stfu, n00b. annnnnnnnyways...right now i'm just chilling.. i've had it with mawfawkin' planes, trains, and automobiles. my parents also lost a bag of luggage, which sucks because all of my tshirts and shit were in there, as well as a couple pairs of nice jeans.. not to mention tons of my dad's electronic gadgets (a palm pilot n shit). hopefully we'll get it back (i'm guessing we will, since it has our address, etc. plastered all over it.). as far as other exciting shit goes (well this isn't really exciting, but more funny..) - my dad caught me smoking. aaahaha. it was quite humourous.. i had seen them on the top deck relaxing, and told them i was going in the sauna. i went back to the cabin to drop my shit off and decided that i wanted to have a smoke.. about three drags in, i hear the lock start to click, and i rapidly begin snuffing the butt in the ashtray, as my dad proceeds to walk in. i stand there like a deer in headlights with the ashtray (avec cigarette) in my hand, and my dad looking at me like ""wtf lol"". he says ""what are you doing?"" my response: ""uhmm.. just having a smoke..."". him: ""oh you don't have to put that shit out for me! LOL! you'll quit someday..[laughs a lot after his comment]. you might as well finish it!"". it was then that i proceeded to spark it up and finish it, with him chilling in the room with me. two minutes later he says ""hey you got a light? i wanna smoke this cigar, gotdayum."" aaaaaaha. i knew i'd get caught one day... at least it went as smooth as it did (i had imagined it was going to be a lot rougher..).. so yes. what a good week... drinking every day - bombay sapphire (omfgzz <3gin&juice LOL)... jim beam black (omfgzz <3whiskey sours).. stolichnaya (omfgzz <3screwdrives). and beer.. loooooots.. and lots.. of beer. so yeah.. back to school in a day.. so i'm just going to chill for the rest of my [slightly stressful] march break."

"event","was absolutely fucking awesome. it was my second time seeing them (not enough) and they just fucking owned everything. more people were there for them than they were there for Dillinger, who were the headliners. fucking. fuck. they're so amazing. i got a sick hoodie and a horse t-shirt with Cutsman on it.. yes.. that's right bitches.. cutsman. i bought the horse cd too.. sick as hell.

anyways.. we almost didn't get in..

we got all the way there (hamilton) and the guy said ""i'm sorry, the venue for tonight is completely sold out"". i'm like.. ""fuggthat you stupid slut.. i'm getting in there whether you like it or not.. btbam is my fav band so suck nutsack."" and he was like ""..kay.."".. well not really .. but anyways.. the keyboardest from Horse The Band came out and was talking to two people about having four spots extra on his guest list, so he said ""give me 20 bucks each and i'll put you on it.."" i heard this and ran over to him and was like ""yo can you make that 5 spots and get me and my two friends on it!?"" and he said ""no i only have two spaces left.."" so i bit the bullett and put mat and adriana on it.. i knew there was a way i'd get in.. so after a quite some of bitching out loud (in hopes of someone with an extra ticket hearing me), this guy in the reserve ticket line said ""yo... i have an extra reserve ticket.. one of my friends couldn't come.."" i was like..""fuck yeah."" so i bought it, and we all ended up getting in.. \m/.

it was the fucking sweetest show ever. Horse closed with cutsman, and btbam's setlist was as follows (in order, obviously,.):

All Bodies
(DIRECTLY into Autodidact)
Selkies
Alaska
and....

mordecai. it was fucking awesome.

"event","today was uneventful, aside from the fact that i went to the mandarin with my grandparents. other than that... refer to title.

my whole depressed feeling thing comes back still. and it really is getting fucking annoying because it's skewing my decision making and my mind up. i don't even know what i want anymore; one minute i wanna get up and go somewhere, the next minute i want to sleep. one minute i want a girlfriend, the next minute i wanna be single. this whole week has been weird, but i'm thinking it's because i started working again, and i'm pretty tired lately, so i'm gonna use that as my reasoning behind it.

just to expand on the whole girlfriend thing... i'm in a bind right now.. because i want to ""get back together with someone"" but i don't know if i should. if i do, i don't know if people are gonna think i'm a chump for doing so after she dumped me. i don't want to look like a fuckin' baby who sits around with his thumb in his bum, and then takes back a girl that screwed me over. but i guess you just can't help it if you have feelings for someone.. my friend told me to screw her over back, but that's fucking childish.. i mean come on... sure, when you date in highschool, you tend to play games, but come on.. that's fucking stupid. besides, i could never actually bring myself to do that.. i still do have feelings for her, and the thought of doing that to her just gets me in an even shittier mood.

and i know what you're thinking: how could you still have feelings for someone who jewed you over for a younger/more assholish guy? well that's easy... it wasn't her fault she wanted to be with him.. and it wasn't my fault either.. a person can't help it if they have a change of heart, and i respect her for telling me in person what she wanted. i hate giving second chances to people who fuck me over... but i honest to god like her a lot.

so yeah, i guess what this all boils down to is i do like her.. and maybe i'm depressed [i fuckin hate that word] because i want to be with her, and i'm not sure if i can.. i dunno.. i have to think about it more, and talk to her more... i need to know what she's thinking about and stuff. and i doubt she wants to be with me again.. but then again, there's always a chance. (by the way, the guy she dumped ME for dumped HER. and for a split second, it made me feel good that ""what went around, came around"" back to her... but then i realized that that's no way to think.. that's just childish and immature: two wrongs DON'T make a right.. contrary to popular belief.)

so at 12:45 on a thursday night, i'm sitting in bed, waiting for tomorrow to come.. another day of work... another day of getting up and thinking about wanting to be with her. it's so shitty. i just wanna hold her again but at the same time.. i can't because it's really fucking hard to bring myself to tell her i still like her after what she did. whatever. i'm sure it will pan out in the end... i'm also positive i'm making a big deal out of nothing, considering that ""This is just highschool: no relationships should take up this much thought! right!?"" fuckkkkkkkk thaaaaaat.

i gotta work at 9. so i have to sleep. comment if you have opinions on what i should do... thanks guys.. it would mean a lot.

"event","sometimes you don't really know yourself.. and that's weird, because you should know you,... right? wrong.. lately, i feel like i'm down in the dumpsters, but i'm not at the same time. i'm obviously happy; i'm healthy, i'm on summer holidays, i did well in school, and i have a job and my summer is exciting... so why do i feel like shit for sporatic periods of time? all of a sudden, i feel like i'm just gonna fucking break down and it's really stupid. and then after a minute or so.. i'm fine again. it only happens when i'm by myself. i get really tired, lazy, sloppy, down,.. whatever. i just don't feel like me, and it's pissing me off because i can't put my finger on why this would be happening.

on another note, i saw 4 people tonight that i haven't seen in (it seems like) billions of years: Harrison Pink, Simon Baker, Courtney Kraik, and Chanel Wood. these guys were possibly the coolest grade 13's i knew when i was in grade 9. usually a grade 13 would've sluffed a ""niner"" off and told them to ""go elsewhere,"" but not these guys,. they couldn't've made my first year of highschool more enjoyable and more awesome. after i saw them i was happier, so i'm hoping i just needed a little seratonin boost in the form of 'seeing-good-friends-again'.

another reason for me being slightly not happy, is that ( yeah i know this is stupid and typically 'LJ', buuuut..>.. ) there is this girl.. who is amazing.. and i knew i wanted to be with her the second i saw her, but, as usual, with most things, i was stupid and got lost in the moment, and more importantly, was lost for words... i couldn't say anything if my life depended on it. and (now) by the time i could get the words out (which was a few weeks ago), it was too late. i have to learn to take charge more often. to be more confident... to take hold of the situation. lately, though, i've noticed that this seems to be the case with most things.

holy shit.. long update. i have to stop.

hope you liked the essay.

They started off with Nihilist. that fucking rooled. then... they played that certain specialy ugly.. obviously a great tune... after that, the began to play new stuff: first Black Santa then Upper Decker. during upper decker.. i'm sure people lost a tooth and broke a nose.. it was fucking nutz. then they played catalepsy. then more new stuff: clients and then antman. then they played Fixation on Plastics, and closed with DREAMING IN DOG YEARS. fuck.

Picture 100 people. standing close. room enough to swing their arms, and them being angry, angry, teenagers, who are motivated by deathly, angry sounding music, to want to kill the person next to them. yeah. that was the mood for the last 30 seconds of Dreaming in Dog Years. now picture those same people almost suceeding in their goal to kill someone. i swear... there was so much thrashing going on it was insane. for the last words ""IT'S NOT GONNA BE ALRIGHT. IT'S NOT GONNA BE OKAY"" everyone rushed the singer and fucking pounced on the mic in hopes of screaming or growling those last few syllables into it. man. it rocked so/ fuckin/ much.

Zakir and I recorded a song last night. Mr. Dawson (a music teacher here) helped us record it with his studio equipment and it sounds bitchin.. we're hoping to get back in and record two more songs so we can have a 3 song demo.. what we'll do with it.. probably nothing since he's graduating in june.. but maybe we can make a bit of moolah off it.. that'd be sick.. other than that.. nothing's new in the music department.

summer is looking cool... work.. which means money.. which means gas money.. since i'll have my license in a month... which also means money for partying.. with my i.d. ... all in all it looks like the summer will be a lot of fun.. 8 bucks an hour for washing dishes? cha.

other than that... nothing's new... i'm chilling in my dorm room as we speak.. err.. as i type.. tons of tests are coming up and in a week i go to vancouver with the jazz band for the nationals (jazz band competition) and i'm pretty stoked about that.. even though it's only for two and a half days.. clarke-o and i are gonna get massively wasted after our competition.. hopefully i'll get my hands on some bc hydro as well...

The cruise was so awesome. i've decided i wanna go on one every year.. my parents said i get one holiday, and i want that to be the one i get. they're just so awesome.. - you get free food 24/7! you can gamble! (not that's a really great thing, but it can be fun from time to time). AND. YOU MEET COOL PEOPLE..*ahem* cool CHICKS.. i'll expand on this later on. haha

So yes.. it stopped in Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama.. not Barbados, St. Marten, and Martinique, as it was before thought. this is because the travel agent is a dumb bitch ('scuse) who needs her dick (yes, her dick) removed, and hands cut off.... :). but i'm not that mad, because if i didn't go on this one, i wouldn't have met some awesome people, including this awesome girl from california (teeheeeee!!1!11!!ONE1!ONE).. she's really awesome, and awesome, and ....shit she's so awesome. her name's Amber.. awesome everything, to sum it up quickly- amazing personality, gorgeous beyond gorgeousity (i think made that up just now) and such a happy awesome funny person. haha. 

i also met some heebs on the boat that i boozed with. they were awesome too. some girls from alabama (haw haw...) who were quite.. ahem... generous, shall we say? haha.. and some other californians. they were real cool too...

No drinking age in any of the ports-of-call made it hard to not have a good time. haha, although it was sad because where ever i turned there were kids asking me for money, food, whatever they could get. guys selling the shirts off their back.. women begging. it's a terrible feeling to see shit like this and not be able to do anything about it, being only 16, not old enough to vote, not old enough to be heard, knowing that there's billions of dollars going to waste in canada on shit like.. new roads.. hell, these people don't even have a garage to park a car, if they even have one those.

Fun a-plenty aboard the Carnival Legend, indeed. not to mention the Cuban comedian they had on board... holy shit was that a laugh and a half.. heh. anyways...

hope everyone is well, and that their march breaks were just as relaxing / fun / exciting.. whatever.

i'm back boys and girls....be happay. ha.

She's always moping about how i don't live there anymore. What doesn't she understand? I lived with her for 14 years and that's not enough for her? I can't spend 4 years with my dad (whom she never let me see when i was kid)? Like what the fuck women. I hate going there now, and i know i have to, in fact, i'm obligated to, because she's my mother, but i can't take all the fuckin' bullshit anymore. EVery SINgle FUCKing TIME. it's getting SO redundant i wanna chop my fucking ears off. whatever though. all i ever do is go there and sit in my fucking bedroom for 4 straight days anxiously awaiting the time until i get back to st. kitts. it's really depressing. whatever. i leave for my cruise in 3 days. thank god."

"event","Where to start...

Last night was the night before our ""house history day"" in chapel, so we decided to pull a few pranks that were reminiscent of the old Leonard House. Speaking to Mr. Brezicki, Leonard's first housemaster, we acquired knowledge of an old prank in which tables in the Great Hall were stacked on top of eachother in a pyramid-like fashion, with a sign on top saying ""EAT MY SOCKS, COWBOY."" The pyramid had a bass of 16 tables, a second layer of 9 tables, a third layer of 4, and one table on top of that to ""top it off."" 

Yes. This was EXTREMELY hard to do, but, it was done...

Therefore, we decided to re-pull this prank, along with another (which Mr. Gittings, property manager, was extremely pissed about.)

So, we set out into the cold, cold night. Brock Fowler left windows open in the basement of the school earlier on in the day, in order for us to enter the school after it had been locked for the night. On his command, we mobilized to the school, dressed in dark clothing to conceal our identities (this is like a james bond script). Once inside the school, we proceeded to pull the first prank.

The First Prank:

Pictures (extremely idiotic ones) were taken of each Deans boy, and about 400 copies were run off. Each one was placed inside a frame of some sort around the school, with the intent of forcing everyone at ridley to look at our ghastly faces for the whole day. Once this was finished, we proceeded to the dining hall.

The Second Prank:

We tried to get into the dining hall by our original idea of picking the door to the small dining hall (which leads into the large one) with a lock pick that brock had. However, it was soon realized that these locks are VERY VERY GOOD. so, we proceeded to look for another means of entry. Upon climbing up onto the roof, it was seen that windows were not locked, however, they were stopped with small latches that prevented them from opening more than a foot. Therefore, this idea was ruled out. We then set out for looking for another door or window that could be opened. Myles tried to take the hinges off the actual door, but was unsuccesful with two of the three hinges. Feeling depressed and much like failures, we wandered outside whimpering that we were going to look like large tools for not having pulled of this prank that was to be spoken about in chapel the next day. But, while wandering, a door to the kitchen was seen, and vlad decided to give lock-picking it a try. After about 5 minutes (and Fowler taking down a window to the boiler room which he thought connected to the kitchen, but didn't), Vlad opened the door. shouts of glee were heard, but were soon ""shhd"" by brock and many other seniors... It would've been a terrible thing to get caught just as we had entered.

Upon entrance to the dining hall, set-up was immediatley begun. The removal of chairs from all of the tables was first, soon followed by the creation of the base of the pyramid - 16 tables all formed a rectangle. Then, tables (9 of them heavy Oak fuckers) were lifted on top of the base, and arranged in a rectangle of the same shape. This was followed by six tables on top of the 9, and 4 tables on top of the 6, and 1 table on top of the 4 (keep in mind that we only had so many people to work with, and it took about 4 people to lift one table above their heads...4 layers x 4 = 16 people. absolutely greeeaaaat). we then proceeded to tape a large banner with the words ""EAT ME BUNNIES"" (referring to AB west, who's mascot is a playboy bunny) at the VERY TOP OF THE PYRAMID. i shit you not, this was the most amazing goddamn thing i've ever seen. after that, the letters ""DH"" were spelled with the chairs in the large space in front of the pyramid.

Upon our arrival back at the house, a slight ""partay"" celebration was started, with very many toasts. haha....that lasted about 2 hours, until we went to Tim Horton's at 4 FRIGGIN' A.M.

man. it was awesome.

although i did not go to bed (and i'm not exaggerating - i actually didn't sleep at all last night), it was oh-so-worth it.

Anyways, that is the story. Gittings had one hell of a time getting all our fruity-looking photos out of the frames and cases. man. every minute of it was mint.

we've decided that each year, on the exact same date, and exact same time, an equally awesome prank will be pulled. hope you guys enjoyed the story. it was the coolest frickin' thing i've ever been a part of in my life."

"event","haha..only three more days of hell. then i'm out. i can't wait. in fact, i'm so damn excited, that i think my head's gonna explode.

i'm listening to the new Mars Volta cd...it's pretty damn good if i must say so myself. it rivals their first one, but the one thing i like more, is that there's less bullshit and sounds and ambiences and gay shit like that, and more ACTUAL MUSIC. well that's what a cd is supposed to be right? i mean.. if i wanted to hear noises i'll just go buy one of those ""sleepytime nighttime noise cd's"" from shopper's Drugmart. anyways, i gotta hit the hay, but yeah...go buy Frances The Mute. the last track is wicked.

"event","finally, second term is coming to a close...only 3 more assignments: english ISP, world religions powerpoint presentation (a friggin' joke of a project) and a bio quiz/worksheet. after thursday, it's all about drums, the cruise, sunny weather, music, relaxation, etc. etc. etc. and most especially - NO SCHOOL. i haven't posted anything because i've been busy the last couple days and yesterday was one of the busiest.

in other news, JAZZ A BAND HAS RECEIVED GOLD FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE MUSICFEST REGIONALS, AND IS NOW QUALIFIED FOR MUSICFEST CANADA IN RICHMOND, BRITISH COLUMBIA. i am absolutely fuckin' STOKED and i can't WAIT to go away to this wonderful province. it will be ten times better than the montreal trip...which means that it's gonna be absolutely amazing, because montreal rocked so hard. anyways, i still have to get the ""o.k."" from Big Daddy, but i'm sure he'll say yes with my current grades...

anyways guys, march break is so close, i can almost feel the hot sun on my back as i watch the port of miami go bye-bye as we live for barbados, st.martin, st. lucia, and the likes. i'm absolutely ...well...not to use this word again, but, STOKED, to get outta here.

i'm in london on thursday, and i think sebi said something about a birthday party and lots of alcohol...COUNT ME IN BROS,...as long as you got some HOES. haha.

"event","well...i guess this week is turning out pretty good. i had a bio quiz..which went over well, and i got a few marks back and i'm pleased. this should turn out to be a promising break, as i now have my drums back, so i can rock a bit. after a week of relaxation (and a week in london visiting parental unit M.), i leave for my cruise. i'm so super-stoked.. it's stopping in barbados, St. martin, and a couple other islands. i'm so excited for relaxation and sunny-times. i can't stand the snow anymore. i wanna move to new york, because i do like a BIT of snow, but for three months, it's just too much...

hopefully i'll come back refreshed, and ready to take on third term. life is turning out pretty good lately....wicked.

hope y'all have a good march break if i don't talk or see you anytime soon, and be sure to leave a comment. i wanna see people (holmes, let's chill when i come to the L-Dot). peace guys, keep it real.

"event","WOW has it been a while! A lot has happened to me since the last time I wrote in here. Basically all crap and bad stuff. 
 Well, I have been having to go to therapy recently because I don't think my parents appreciate me... with all the things I do, I just can't understand why they wouldn't acknowledge my achievements. Just so you get a better understanding, here are my current commitments: 1. Student Council 2. Writer's Guild 3. Helping Hands Club 4. Track 5. Obviously, school. And now I am going to have all these new responsibilities: 1. Volunteering at both the Humane Society and New Mercer Commons Asst. Living Home 2. National Honor Society 3. Job. Hopefully that will give them a lap in the face with how mature, responsible, and independent I am- I hate them sometimes.
 So, in the past month, I have gone from having a girlfriend to not having a girlfriend- and it's February, isn't that like the official Love Month or something with Valentine's Day and all. So, basically Chelsea and I were going out for 3 weeks then she broke up with me over the internet the day before Valentine's Day, just hours after I bought her $40 in V-Day gifts, not that I'm bitter. But I think I may have a new crush- well, actually- more like an old crush rekindled. Now I am worried about not being asked to Sadies in 2 weeks!
 Track has started and pretty much sucks. I am only doing it so that I can letter, get a P.E. waver, and have another Extra Curricular on my college resume. So, I am doing the jumps this year (I have changed my event every year for the past 3 years), because I figured it will be easy. But now the retarded coach is making me run the 400! She is a bitch- I refuse!
 So, I was faced with a decision to make recently, to either stay at this hell hole that is Fossil Ridge or go to the better Fort Collins, guess which I chose? That's right, Fossil Ridge. Why you ask? I'll tell you. Though I absolutely despise the administration, Student Council was the deciding factor. I have taken up leadership a great deal in my life recently, because I have been needing a boost of self-confidence after going through Jr. High. Michel, my Student Adviser, is the best- he pushed me to do my best and step out of my comfort zone while making me feel safe which is exactly what I needed. I really don't think I will have as many possibilities to excel or be a pilar in school at Collins as I am at Fossil.
 Well, that's all I got for now- 'till next time...."

"event","Besides the funeral, which was really nice- and very sad, I had a pretty good Christmas. I got a sweater-vest, two sweaters- one of which is going to be returned, the U2 CD 'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb,' Anchorman DVD, The Bon Jovi CD box set '100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong,' a necklace from AE, $50 AE gift card, DVD burning software, a CD player for the Civic, and the book 'Youth in Revolt'- which, may I say, is the most sexual book I have ever read. 
 I am in such trouble because the sweater-vest my Mom got me, I already shrunk! And I mean SHRUNK! I am planning on putting it in the laundry with my sister's stuff and frame her, saying that she did it!!! It'll work!
 I've pretty much spent all my Christmas money already, on an AE Sweatshirt, Track Jacket, and a pair of jeans from Fossil.
 I saw 'Meet the Fockers' a couple of days ago, and it's hilarious! Really dirty- mainly because Ben Stiller's mom, Barbra Streisand, is a sex therapist for elderly people. I don't want to say much more because I will give everything away- but go see it!
 I really don't have plans for New Years, which is sad- I know! I want my parents to let me have people over, they probably will."

"event","My mom came home today sobbing, she told me to come into the other room because she needed to tell me something. Earlier today, my Aunt Mary called asking for my mom or dad, but neither of them were home. I told her to call my dad at work, and thought nothing of it. Once I thought about it, I knew before my mom told me. My cousin Richie was killed in Iraq this morning. Apparently, he was patrolling with one of his friends, and when a truck passed by them, it rolled over a bomb and exploded. All my mom said, initially, was that he was killed - she then continued crying for a while. I didn't, mainly because I was numb and didn't know what to make of the situation. I just sat there, with Buddy - thinking. I couldn't believe it, I saw him right before he was about to leave, and that was less than a year ago. He was there no more than 3 months. Anyway, I hope all who read this realize how fortunate we are to be here, safe. And I hope this changes your perspective this holiday season, I know I am less greedy!"

"event","I had a pretty bad week - primarily because I got in a huge fight with my sister over the car on Thursday. I called her a bitch, whore, skank, slut, said she should contract AIDS and die or just die for no reason. She told my mom and dad who got pissed and grounded me from the car for the next week. I had a Math test today that I am quasi-confident about. I also heard that Eric got kneed in the face, fell back on his head on the basketball court during their last game and has a concussion - I kind of laughed.
We also learned a verb form of Poner, where the Yo form is puse (pronounced like pussy) - when I said it, I said ""I feel dirty."" It was funny. I know my week sounds fairly good so far, but like I said - only to get worse. I am basically dependent on my parents for rides and since we are on 'non-speaking' terms, it sucks. I have The SnowBall Dance set-up from noon till 4 tomorrow but I have to go to school at 10 AM to work on The Fountain Project with Addy and her tutor. Then I have the dance from 8:30-11:30. Plus, I have so much homework, especially in English - I probably shouldn't have spent my time typing my Chrismukkah list during lab time to write our essay. Oh well. And BTW - I edited my on-line Chrismukkah list, deleted the DodgeBall movie because I think I might get it as my Secret Santa gift for StuCo. So, next week starts finals week which sucks. I am dreading my Spanish final!
I am bored typing, will later..."

"event","I have been thinking about ir recently, and I really want to ask the girl I like out but I am nervous. Mainly because there is this other guy who is like, always around her and I can't tell if she likes me or him - and I have a fear of rejection. I really like her and I think we would be good together, but it would make it really uncomfortable for her to turn me down and then go back to being friends. I have talked to several people about it hoping that they would catch my drift that i ""don't"" want them to tell her- but none of you are smart. Oh well...
I got the Kelly Clarkson CD ""Breakaway"" and man is it awesome! The only thing I don't like about it, besides the horrible booklet and cover photo, is the live version of ""Beautiful Disaster"" which was off her previous album and was sung at last year's American Idol finale. I am not very partial to live stuff. ""Since U Been Gone"" and ""Because of You"" are the two best songs!You should all buy it!
Here are some suggestions of what I want for Chrismukkah-
1. Diana DeGarmo CD ""Blue Skies""
2. Kelly Clarkson CD ""Thankful"" (Because my burned copy is crapping out on me!)
3. The O.C. Novelization #3
4. American Eagle Gift Cards
If you are getting me something, be sure to tell me because I am not planning on buying something for everyone and it would be awkward for me to get something and not have something for you!
I went to Jessy Hoefer and Cassidy Phillips birthday today at Chipper LAnes, formerly Monte Carlo. It was so much fun! There were like eight or so of us, we basically messed around the whole time and for some extremely cool reason, the workers didn't care what we did. Unlike Horsetooth Lanes, we double bowled, walked all over the lanes when we bowled too lightly and had to retrieve the ball - it was so great! Fun party guys!"

"event","Today, I awoke to my mom upstairs. I went to see why she was home, and she told me she had the day off and was going to Flat Iron. And she asked me if I wanted to go instead of school - HELL YEAH! We picked up Maren, Troy wasn't there because he was complaining of soreness. He is such a baby, they haven't even started the basketball season and he's already crying!
ANYWAY, we got to Denver and the first thing we do is get the silverwear my mom went to get at some store we don't have here. Then she wants to split up because ""She doesn't want to go in the stores I want to."" Mom lingo for, ""I need to get Christmas presents for you."" So I went off, did some shopping, tried to get some gifts for others but only bought for myself! Got an argyle sweater for $52.00 at Fossil. (I already washed it and it shrunk a lot - DAMN!) When I met up with my mom later, I was nervous to show her because I was asking for an argyle sweater for Christmas but told her I couldn't resist. She got me an argyle sweater-vest from J-Crew. She almost returned it but I convinced her not to. -Close one!
We ate at Chipotle for lunch before heading home because I needed to be back for 6th period Yearbook to finish my page for the deadline.
I am so glad it's Thanksgiving break! I am spending it with my neighbors- we have a tradition of alternating hosting dinner and the other dessert. Then the kids go to a movie, I want to see Christmas With The Kranks!
-Well, Troy and Jeremiah are coming over so I got to go.

School has been busy, a lot of projects, tests, and homework! ICPE and Math especially. We started Chemistry in ICPE and finished a unit in Math.
I saw The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie! It was incredible! So funny, especially the outfit Patrick wears in the end! I saw it with Chelsea and, Aahhh, Mark Haprper who is IN LOVE with her! He was holding her hand and caressing her thigh during the entire movie! And when he finally left, he tried to kiss her - I didn't see it but I heard it! He's cool and stuff, but has no chance.
Thanksgiving is coming up, looking forward to the break! Hannah and I spent pretty much the entire day together today, and she told me that if you wear your P.J.'s inside out- it will cause a Snow Day - So you all need to wear them inside out Sunday night!!!
I hope you are all thinking of what to get me for Christmas! American Eagle gift cards are greatly appreciated!

And during lunch, I had to take a Math test and found out today in Math that we will be starting the Fountain Project soon! I am terrified! On a brighter note, Seed of Chucky comes out today- it looks really funny! I want to see it and Finding Neverland, I know Finding Neverland, but it looks good.
Let me give you a rundown of future releases of good things:
1.) November 30th- Kelly Clarkson's CD Breakaway
2.) December 1st- The O.C. Novelization #3
3.) December 7th- Diana DeGarmo's CD Blue Skies AND Dodgeball DVD
4.) December 21st- Napoleon Dynamite DVD
5.) December 28th- Anchorman DVD
6.) February 1st- The O.C. Novelization #4
Don't bother buying me any of these for X-MAS because I will get them right away!
-Actually, Hannah, you can get me something because you still owe me a B-Day present from September!
Not much else to say, went to Inta Juice with Hannah, Troy, and Jeremiah earlier this evening. Poor Troy, we ripped on him so bad, but it's all good. He knows we are just kidding."

The Homecoming assembly ROCKED, it looked so good - I am so proud! - but the game was alright. We lost of course, but the half-time show was what upset me. It sucked, and the whole court thing was crap! Joanna and Tammer won for Spohmores and Chelsea, yeah!, and Chase won for juniors. We have been working on the dance for a while  now, finished it this afternoon and the dance is tonight. I have so much homework, don't know when I am going to do it - I have to clean up the dance tomorrow for most of the day.
The O.C. was amazing on Thursday!

"event","Last night, my sister and I went to go see the FCHS production of ""Singin' In The Rain."" Basically, except for a couple of cool song-and-dance sequences, it sucked! The reason I went to go see it was because my friend Erin was in it - though she was just a part of an ensemble. We got second row-center seats so it was cool to be that close - but also bad because I could see all of the BAD acting! The two lead actors were SO stiff, especially the guy - who also SUCKED at singing (actually, they both did equally.) I want to have a word with their casting director! Mainly because the two secondary actors should have gotten the leads; they could act, dance, and sing ten times better than the people who were the leads! Plus, they were the only comic relief in the otherwise boring musical. BAD, BAD, BAD!
On to today, my family and I are going to go see Friday Night Lights around noon, then my mom and I are going to get me Homecoming clothes, and hopefully some clothes just to get. Next week is Spirit Week at FRHS, so I need to have things for the dress-up days. All I have clothes for is Salad Dressing Day and FRHS Colors Day. I need Decades, Pirates, and Sports Day - though I could probably find something for Sports Day.
I will probably end up doing nothing tonight because I have homework still to do and my day is already really busy!
-OH gosh, I almost forgot! So, yesterday when my mom and sister picked me up at FRHS from the StuCo work day, they told me they were out looking for a new car! They were looking at a Dark Greenish-Bluish Honda Accord, sunroof, and leather interior. The Civic should be fixed in about 2 weeks and hopefully we will get a new car soon! I really hope they consider buying it or any car for that matter. This is sooo funny, I crashed the car then thinking that it would be a while for us to have it back and would have killed the option of getting another car next year. But now, it is getting fixed and we are considering buying another ar sooner! I should crash cars more often!"

"event","Before I tell you all about the catastrophe that was my first high school party, first let me tell you about the good day I was having yesterday. All I did in 1st period ICPE was do my math homework and read the school newspaper. Third period Geo, all I did was do the homework that was assigned that day and watch T.V. Fifth period as the best. Math, we ate donuts and this kid ordered pizza, though I HATE pizza!, took really easy notes, and finished my homework while we watched Halloween episodes of The Simpsons. StuCo 7th period is always fun.
Last night was Trick-Or-Treat Street at FRHS. Trick-Or-Treat Street is organized by StuCo which allows little kids to come to the school, trick-or-treat at the classroom doors and play games. It was actually really fun. Chelsea and I were assigned to he same room, because out outfits matched. We finished around 8:30, then Troy, Jeremiah, Megan, Joanna, and Ashley went to Josh Rudkin's party. Thus we get to the horribleness!
So, the party was really lame, there was like 15 people there and they all sucked! The music was horrible and everybody there was just standing around - if they weren't leaving already. Everyone we came with left except Jeremiah and Troy, and it was - I'm guessing - because Eric was there. I really didn't want to stay, but Jeremiah refused to leave, so I sat in his car for an hour-and-a-half! I finally called Chelsea and she and Kim came and picked me up! Troy called me as they were leaving the party which was the same time Chelsea came and wanted to know if we were still hanging out later that night. Obviously not! Chelsea and I drove around, got some Wendy's and that's about all that happened last night.
So, today I had to go to FRHS from 11:00-4:00 for a work day, spent basically the whole time covering the exterior sides of the gym windows for the assembly because for some idiotic reason they didn't install shades and all the lights are set to motion sensor so we have to unscrew every lightbulb so there isn't any light during the assembly.
I am going to the FCHS play of 'The Rain Man' tonight, Erin is in it. Might trick-or-treat tomorrow, might not. I am really mad that nobody has parties, good parties, like at other schools - IT SUCKS!
But that's my eventful life so far..."

We were coming back from getting our costumes when she wanted to drive through THE neighborhood (Harbor Estates where the accident happened). She wanted to see where it happened, so we went by it. Supposedly, she thought it would be therapeutic or something. So, anyway... on the way out of the neighborhood on the same street it happened, she pointed at a house and stupid me looked. She then decided to slam on her breaks. I FREAKED OUT! I seriously almost pissed my pants, not even joking! I was almost hyperventilating, and she was laughing.

Plus, we had to take an Inagural Picture. I was in the front row next to Molly and Cassidy. The photographer was a total douche.
Today, Jeremiah and I asked Shanna and Hannah to Homecoming. We got them flowers and left them in their locker with notes attached to them. They both said yes, I asked Hannah and Jeremiah asked Shanna, in case you were confused. I think we are planning on Jeremiah driving over to my house, picking me up and we would go to Hannah's house and pick them both up there and then possibly go to dinner or something. Probably with Addy and several of her friends if we decide to go.

I found out today that I am walking with my friend Molly at the Inaugural Assembly for Homecoming Royalty. (FYI- I got in due to a default, some kid dropped out and I was an alternate.) I think it should be fun, we are in the first group to be announced. It will be set-up as a fashion show in Paris, we will be walking to runway music and stuff like that. I am excited!

The O.C. stuff is awesome! I was disappointed though because they didn't have the Chrismukkah CD. Oh well, they said to check back on Friday.

I paid attention the whole movie and I still have no clue what it was about! But oh well, it was funny because for some reason, my dog kept barfing and Troy was freaking out. It was pretty funny!

After school, I went to the first meeting for the Fossil Ridge Writer's Guild, totally sucked! Apparently the idiot that is Mr. Heartshorn announced the date wrong, so only 2 other girls and I went. Unfortunately, the 2 other girls were Ana Ilic and Michelle Barry. Two of the dumbest, most retarded girls EVER! They were talking about last year's Halloween and how Michelle threw a ""Party,"" basically she invited her reader geek friends over and they wrote and read scary stories! Who does that? We had to read a sample of our writing to eachother - I read the first little bit of the book I am writing. I am very proud of it, it's really good! However, I am not going to tell you because you will copy it and write a (not as good version) book of your own and steal my idea - IDIOTS!
After that, Troy and I had to walk home because my stupid sister wouldn't pick us up because she was ""Too busy doing everything else."" On the way - funny story Ha ha- this guy Yama who used to go to school with us drove by with his posse, actually, his friend was driving. And since I was with Troy, who is the biggest white (1/4 black) person I have ever met, they were yelling at him. He put his arms up, which I guess is the international sign for ""You wanna go?"" I don't know, I don't speak thug. They actually turned around and drove by again really slowly and said that they wanted to beat the shit out of him, he was SO SCARED I am not even joking! They were parked in the parking lot of Celestica or something like that, and Troy was so nervous they were going to jump out and run after us. Seriously, I was not scared one bit. Probably because they didn't want to beat me up. I was laughing at Troy because he kept looking back to see if they left the parking lot, they never did. It is funny how Troy talks so much like he is black and whatever, then when he is faced with something like that where a normal black person would step up, he shits bricks! I will never forget that!
Tomorrow I have an ICPE quiz, not looking forward to that. Then in Geography, I have to sit through country presentations. THe good thing is I get to miss math, because I get to go to the Loveland High Homecoming Assembly, since my committee in Student Council is in charge of it, Michael wants us to see how one looks. Should be fun!"

"event","Today, they announced the Homecoming, or rather Inaugural, court nominees. A few of the people I nominated made it, and I know who I am going to vote for for the final election. Since Sam T. didn't nominate me initially - and I blame her for me not being in the court (Really, I couldn't give a shit though!), I am not voting for her. I am voting for Joanna C. because she is awesome and deserves it! For the guy, I think I will go with David L. And if we can vote for Juniors, Dan K. and either Nikki O. or Chelsea J. Sorry Chelsea, but we all know that Nikki will win. My committee is in charge of the Inaugural Assembly, and just found out today, 2 weeks before the assembly is dated, that most of everything we have planned has been changed by Michael, my student adviser. That really pissed me off, at least they are slight changes that will be fairly easy but STILL TIME CONSUMING!
My yearbook partner, Tyler, and I are totally screwed tomorrow. It is the first deadline, and we have nothing to show for it! No pictures have been downloaded to out template which means no captions have been written and our story is still at a draft stage. If I fail to meet this deadline, I basically fail the quarter! That would piss the shit out of me! (Piss the shit, that's funny!)
Tomorrow, I am so busy. We have the first ever meeting of the Writers Guild and I have to go to a play at the Lincoln Center in the evening for E.C. in English - not that I need it or anything.
Tonight, I have to make a very difficult phone call. I need to call Everett Schneider and tell him that foreign exchange student thing isn't going to work out - I am scared! I feel bad too because they have invested all this time in me and I have sort of been leading them on, making them sense that I am fully interested - but I am not!
Gave my Geography presentation today, the one on greece with Addy. It went really well! I was disappointed though, because I brought in 2 bottles of Sparkling Cider as ""Wine"" and I was hoping that I wouldn't use all of it so I could drink it at lunch. But I used every last drop - que the violins!
I chewed my former friend Spongebob* out on the internet last night - it felt good! I told him I wanted my movies that I let him borrow like FOREVER ago back, and he said that he wouldn't until I pay him back the 40 bucks I borrowed from him like 2 weeks ago. I told him that due to the accident, it would be a while but I would and in the meantime, I wanted my movies back. Then he got all butt-hurt and started to say that he shouldn't be punished for my stupidity and shit like that. What really pissed me off was that he was saying all these things about the accident- like that I was speeding when it happened, I totaled my car (which, by the way - he has no idea what totaling a car actually means - and I am sure you don't either! Hint: It's not just totally destroying your car). And all this other shit so I started to yell at him. Nobody likes him and the sooner he realizes that, the sooner he can go away! I think he finally realizes that I hold more power than he does, I can control people's opinions about him and I love to do it! I am sure that I sound like a total bastard right now - but trust me, if you knew Spongebob*, you would be one too!

Troy, Addy, and I went out to Starbucks by Cinemark last night at 9:00, we had to walk which wasn't that bad. I got a Carmel Macchiato, Mmmm! After that, Troy spent the night at my house. I went out to lunch today with my siblings and my mom, Troy was still asleep at my house, then I went out shopping a little bit in the afternoon, Troy was still sleeping - kinda. Troy and I have been trying to find something to do all afternoon and it is closing in on time to give up! Even though we have late start tomorrow morning, I know my parents will want me back at 10:30 at the latest! Retards!
I am getting really frustrated at my Spanish 3 teacher because she hasn't updated our grades yet and I want to know what I am getting on my report card. IDIOT!
Troy and I were searching for jobs this afternoon, I want to work at American Eagle but they ""Prefer to higher at 18."" Aeropostale is hiring but I don't like that store as much, but it's money. Safeway is also and I heard they pay well. And my last choice would be IHOP.

I have seen it 3 times in the theater, which is not that much- as compared to my friend Shane who has seen it like 8 times. I am going to buy the movie on December 21st so fast! And the real reason I brought this up is that I bought the soundtrack today at Best Buy. It is awesome because it has all the cheesy songs plus the great dialog from the movie.
I am ""working"" on my Geo project now with Addy, and watching Freddy Vs. Jason, with Troy. So, also you can tell, I am a little preoccupied by all the things cooler than my project.

I read in the review in the Ticket yesterday that it was originally rated NC-17 because of a graphic sex scene between two of the puppets. It was really ""Graphic,"" they were getting into all kinds of positions - missionary, 69, doggy-style, and blow-jobs and stuff like that. There was a trailer for SAW which looks absolutely terrifying, I read it was originally rated NC-17 but got re-rated to an R. And The Grudge, which looks equally as scary! Rated PG-13 though.
 My friend Chelsea was supposed to call me when she got home from Denver tonight so we could hang out, still expecting that call... Tomorrow I have to work on a Geography project with Addy all day and then I have no plans for Monday, since we have it off...

We sort of have this joke going on between our two journals, so I want you to know that I am not a ""Pig."" But I am sure that the only people to read this are the few friends I told I keep this... so no worries.
 Just finished a really good movie called ""Saved!"" I definitely recommend it, except for extremely religious (Christian) people because they may be offended - Like my friend Addy. I told her about this move before I watched it and thought it was slightly mocking religion in general, but after watching it, it's definitely more! But for all of you, like me, who are atheist or some other religion, it's worth a check! Just don't watch it with a Christian because you will never hear the end of it! 
 I also can't wait to see Team America: World Police tomorrow! I have to go with my family unfortunately, but it's because I am 16 and it's ""R."" I know that may sound anti-punk or whatever, but I am a prep so BACK OFF!- Plus, I won't have to pay."

We were gone from 3:00 to 6:00 and it was soooo boring! It seemed so repetitive because we went to two different places and did all the same things, like 20 billion times. But anyway...
 I got an E-Mail from an anonymous person saying that they thought I talked about my Friend Hannah a lot and wanted to know more about her, give me one guess and I bet I can name her! But, she is really cool, red hair, bluish eyes, big jugs - Ha ha, now I am going to embarrass you! Tight ass, not that I look... She is a dancer, so I bet she can contort her body into all types of positions! ;-)
 Took my Spanish 3 final today, 2nd period. Yeah, I pretty much failed it big time!!! I left like 6, 2 point answers blank and guessed on the other half! But oh well, at least it's done now.
 *REALLY FUNNY STORY* During English 4th period, we were discussing the differences between Fiction and Drama. This girl who I hate sooo much and is a total bitch - Ana Ilic - said that fiction was, ""Well Fiction."" And so I turned to my friend Sarah and said - aloud mind you so that the rest of the class could hear - ""What, fiction is fiction? No way, don't even. I don't believe you."" I said it in such a sarcastic way that it was hilarious (You probably had to have been there, but...). Sarah and I spent the rest of the period compulsively laughing!"

"event","Holy Crap! Today was one of the longest days in my entire life! I woke up and the first thing I though of was that I forgot to finish my Lab Report for ICPE. So I quickly got up and finished that, but the lab questions were cut off so I couldn't read what it was asking so I didn't do it. got ready in enough time... then school.
 Period 1 (ICPE) Turned in my Lab Report and, with the help from some good persuading skills, got an extension on the questions. Then we began on a shit load of notes and got assigned like a bazillion homework questions.
 Per. 3 (GEO) Took FOREVER for Ms. McCabe to start class and allow us time to start on our projects. Then, when we finally did, the F-ing fire alarm went off! We have had a fire alarm go off almost every week since the beginning of school, not even joking! So, of course, it was freezing and the firemen were douches and took forever to come so we were out there for like 20 minutes. When we got back, I hurried to finish my lab questions for ICPE so that I wouldn't have to worry about them, got nothing accomplished for GEO though.
 LUNCH - Did most of my unit review questions for the test on Friday, sort of hard, but manageable...
 Per. 5 (Math) Of course, boring and pointless, just worked on another section of review questions for the test.
 Per. 7 (Student Council) Did nothing worth while in that class either!
 After school, I had to wait until 4:15 to have a meeting with the counselor about the whole credits/foreign exchange student thing. Luckily found out that if I get transcripts, I can get credit for my time away. Still contemplating going.
 When that was done, I had 45 minutes before I had to be at school again, this time for Advertising Night with student council. Basically, we mass-produce a lot of psosters and advertisements and shit.
 After that, my mom picked me up because the car is still in the shop from when I wrecked it. She had to go somewhere to get candy for some project she is working on with her work... Get back at like 8:45 and now I am typing and avoiding studying for a HUGE Spanish 3 test I have to take first thing in the morning tomorrow!"

I think the only reason she was accepted was because she flashed the guys who were conducting the interview - JK! But really, my interview went really well and hers was alright. But I'm over it, the only con of this opportunity is the credit situation. Apparently, you get no credits for the year of school you do in the other country. So I would be gone a year and have nothing to show for it! I don't think so. Hannah will probably get credits if she flashes the counselor or president of the Rotary Club or something. Hannah wants to go to Argentina, I want to go to Australia. I have no idea what seems appealing about Argentina! Australia would be awesome!

The scariest part for me, and the funniest part for my friend Hannah, was when all of these guys came out dressed at serial killers from the movies.  They were all around us, and I was very disoriented... I backed into this guy, turned around and found it to be a guy dressed as Michael Myers (From Halloween, not Austin Powers).  I got so scared that I covered my mouth and gasped so loud it was almost a scream!  I was terrified, she was laughing hysterically!  The part that sucked was that it cost like $13!  Now, I am not cheap, but now that I am in a financial bind because of the accident, that really sucked!  But I am over it, I'll just steal 20 bucks from my parents.
 After that, I spent the night at my friend Troy's.  Not very eventful, watched some South Park - the one where Eric tries to win $1000 in the special olympics - and went to bed.  What makes today suck is that I have a shit load of homework and due to the fact that I had to sleep on the floor last night, my back is KILLING ME!"

   Welcome to my journal. A lot has happened to me recently, so let me take some time to clue you in.  I just recently turned 16 and even more recently got my license.  Yesterday, my highschool held a Peach Fuzz Volleyball Game (Volleyball for guys) and being in Student Council, I had to attend.  Afterwords, I drove my friend Brooke home, but on the way, we stopped in this really nice neighborhood to look at this awesome house... and I drove into a parked car! PARKED CAR! I totally screwed up the hood of my car, got a reckless driving ticket, etc.
   But besides that, my life is pretty good.

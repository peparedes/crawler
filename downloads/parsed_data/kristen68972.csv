Holly wouldnt move down a god damn seet god only knows why so i went to the end next to her and i was like holly can you switch seats with kerri because i need to talk to her about the spanish homework (which was non existant) and she gave me the look and i just stared at her and then she moved and then trish came and sat next to me on the other side. I dont think she gets the point yet. So after the meeting i was supposed to go to my grammas because her birthday is today but my dad was like were going to get you a new glove and i was like ummm i dont want a new glove and he goes does it look like i care.

So okay it was like 10:45, and I went upstairs to make shure that the (4) boys were sleeping and I go in the room that the older two share and Mike is playing his gameboy under his covers. I could see the light and I could hear it so I go Mike what are you doing and hes like what? whats going on? Is it morning yet? (In a I just worke up voice) so I went and took awat his gameboy. So mind you this kid has ADD so he was like screaming DON'T TAKE MY GAMEBOY! So i just walked out of the room and closed the door and went back downstaris thinking he would just go to sleep. But noo. He decided that he would wake up his younger brothers to get back at me. So all of a sudden I see Mike with Nick and Matt (the younger 2) at the balcony so I was madd pissed. Then Mike was screaming so the oldest brother woke up and he was pissed that mike woke up the younger two and he started whipping mike with a laundry basket. So I went to put the little ones back to bed and left Chris beating Mike cause he deserved it. So luckly the little two went right back to sleep so then I had to deal with Mike. So he claimed that Chris hit him real hard in the lip and he was like screaming so I was like you know what Mike.. and I was going to say somthing but I caught myself and I went to go get him ice and Chris went after him again while I was gone then I like bitched the kid out and he was like woah and he finally went to bed.

Just got home from softball 9-1. Thats crazy. Oh well it was alright i guess. Then me and my dad went to Tim Hortons to get bagles and I got an iced cap. yumm. So yeah I'm gonna type like 3 of my sisters poems and my moms gonna give me $20. I'm gonna go take a shower now.

"event","Today was good. In lunch Sam was getting pissed off at Michelle and he like whipped out his can of pop and it went all over Michelle. It was quite funny but Michelle didn't think so. So the lunch monitor comes up and goes Sam do I need to write you up and he goes no Michelle throws things at me all the time which is a lie. So then the lunch monitor like sat downh at our table and was like talking to us it was weird. And she started talking about this kid Bill who is in our lunch and how me has ""family problems."" He harasses Sam all the time its madd funny. Then in Spanish today Arroyo wasn't there so we didnt really have to do anything and Amanda was taking random pictures of everyone on my phone. Then she was listning to the little radio i got with my shampoo lol. It was dead quiet because the sub started talking and I went to grab the radio from Amanda and she goes ""DON'T CHANGE IT.. I LOVE THIS SONG,"" while it was dead quite it was great. The Tolu started singing a thousand miles by vanessa carlton to me it was a classic! I love my Spanish posies. The rest of the day was gay but o well. Had softball tonight. It was okay. A ball hit me in the knee and it hurts like a bitch right now. Oh well. I'm gonna go ice my knee.

"event","okay so this morning my dad was making a ton of noise so i went to go see what he was doing and he was in my bathroom looking for tape. What a weirdo. So then i was up even though i could have gone back to sleep i didnt because i was like excited for shcool and i don't know why so i got out of the shower at like 5:50 lol and then i groomed myself untill 6:30 and then i sat around untill 7:30 to go to school.. exciting life i have..
  So were in Spanish today and Amanda sits next to me and we were using arroy's imported Spanish chalk and drawing on the desks. Then we reminised about past conversations we have had online with other people. ..enough said.. and the Amanda turns to me with the most serious face i have ever seen on her and she goes.. on saturday i went to don pablos and they gave me these spicy beans... and i had gass. hahaha it was a classic! Then arroys was using his *colored imported chalk today and then he must have gotten sick of writing on the board so he goes to use the overhead and what do you know the ""man"" pulls out his god damn collection of colored overhead markers. It was great. Oh yeah an me and Amanda stol some imported chalk.
  I have softball and religion tonight. Oh and my uncles in the hospital. I'll write back later tonight if i have time.

"event","Yesterday I went to the gallaria with christine. Twas fun. I blew $80 on 2 tank tops, 2 bras, and a wallet. great. So anyways christine was pranking her brothers friends and she doesn't have mute on her phone so we had to be real quiet and she started to laugh so i took the phone and was like ""hey it's christine"" she was pissed for like 10 seconds then forgave me! So then we went home and i didn't eat dinner because i wasn't hungry. Then at 8:30 I went with my mom to get her hair highlighted and cut because i have no life. We got out of the hair place around 11 (the lady takes forever!) and we went home. I went online and went to bed at like 2.

Ok so today i woke up at 10 because i had to go get my hair cut at 11:30. I got side bangs but they look kind of queer. O well. So i went to tim hortons after and i an iced cap! yumm. Then i went to the bank with my momma. Then i came home and sat around the whole day and at 5:30 i went out to dinner with carli and her family and steve. Then we came home and me, carli and steve watched the grudge and jersey girl. I just got home and i'm talking to tricia about someone who is clearly on crack. Some people never grow up."

wow...where to begin with today...i went to lake orion hs with katie
and callie for the relay for life thingy. it was on the track field and
there were all these tents set up on it and everything and ppl were
walking the field and there were games set up and a lot of other stuff.
so we walked around the track field a lot...then we layed on the
bleachers and tanned..actualy we got burnt, but its better than being
white! then ryan was like rachel come here i gotta tell u a
secret,&nbsp; so i went by him and he was like UR MORE WET THEN KATIE
then he poured his water bottle on me..but luckily katie was there to
get my back and she poured her pop on him. then it was pretty much a
water war bw me, katie, callie, mike, and ryan. except thank god i
didnt get anymore wet. ryan poured his water on callie who's pants were
see thru...so i gave her my sweater thing to tie around her waist. then
mike came running at katie with 2 gallons of water and poured it all
over her...ohhhhh god that was hilarious!! she was soaking wettttt.
then ryan pushed her into this pool andhahha poor katie..but it was
SOOO funnyy, and it took forever for her to finally dry off. um..i lied
to the public..ya see..there was like a stage thingy with guys who had
microphones and were like hosting it or whatever and like there was a
bell that u could ring if it was ur bday&nbsp; like if there had to be
announcments made or whatever. so i really really really wanted to go
onstage and do it and everything. so the guy was like well there isnt
anyone else who's bday was today so...then i was like MINE WAS
YESTERDAY DOES THAT COUNT?! and he was like yes it does! so i was like
yes! then i got to go online and ring the bell like 10 times. then say
my name. then he was like what team are u on and i wasnt on one..so i
was like umm katie what team are we on?! and he was like well she
doesnt know . so then as i was walking off the stage he was like happy
birthday to rachel bc her bday was yesterday. haha it was SOOO funny!!
so then we went back on the bleachers and this guy with green hair came
up. he just had it like colored green for the day it wasnt actually
green. and i got a picture with him!! it was pretty awesome. so then
yea we just kindof hung out a lot and stuff. i met a lot of katies
friends who were extremely awesome and nice.&nbsp; and there was this
thing where if u pay 2bucks per person both ppl put on like this suit
of like a sumo wrestle and ur like really fat and its hard to walk in
it and stuff and neither kt or callie would do it with me so i did it
with grant&nbsp; and I SO TOALLY BEAT HIM! hahaha it was sooooo funny.
then later on i did it with callie..and i beat her!! yeah..it was great
fun. then we all danced. everyone was doing like the cha cha slide,
hockey pockey, and all those other fun dances. then we hung out with
BENNY BOY and all those other ppl. including the green head guy that we
named greeny. then greeny was rolling his eyees at kt ((HOW DARE HIM))
and idk just saying stuff to her so she got sooo pissed and like wanted
to kill him.... hahaha it was SOO hilarious. there were like 3 ppl
holding her back. she was a vicious lil girl. then her kicked his
bootay and ohh so spazzed and went after him. it was soooooo funny. so
they were going at it pretty much the rest of the night. it was the
funniest thing ever. so then it was like 10 30 and we were having to
leave soon bc we couldnt spend the night cause we have a dance
competiton early tomorrow :( so we went to say goodbye to greeny and kt
was like greeny i love u. and he was like ur weird. and she wanted to
hug him but yeah he kept running away from her. so then i stole his
cell phone and programed our #s in it. then kt was chasing after him
and he drove into a lil tent. and he wouldnt come back out! then his
friend named phil was like hitting on me...GOD he was a freak..and
greeny was like take this girl outta my hands((kt)) and he was like i
cant do that but ill take the other one. (me)) AHHHH that was terrible.
so then we pretended like we were leaving but really we hid behind
another text bc we were gonna wait for him 2 come out then we'd attack.
and that phil guy gave us greenys # so we called him haha he hung up on
us! so then he finally came outta the tent and kt hugged him even tho
he didnt want it. lol&nbsp; then i forget what greeny said but KT
SLAPPED HIM!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAH IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY she didnt even
realize she did it til after she was like OMG! it washilarious. wow i
left out a lot of details but oh well..today was SOOOoooo fun!!! greeny
didnt give us his s.n...:( aww oh well he'll call us katie!! haha today
was freaking awesome!!! I LOVEEEEE EVERYONE WHO WAS THEREE!!!! </span><br>

yesterday my little sisters 6-8th grade soccer team was playing that
9-12th grade soccer team again so they asked me to play. i wanted to
drive so i did and on our way we stopped at mcdonalds to get something
to eat. it was my 1st time going to a drive thru while i was driving.
so i ordered and paid the guy which was extremely funnnn. then i was
suppose to pull up to the next window to get the food. idk what i was
thinking but i zoomed past the window and was about to pull outta the
parking lot. then my mom was like rachel...what about our food! then i
was like ohhh whoooops. so i reveresed the car and went back, but i
ended up about 5 feet away from the window. so i put it drive and was
gonna go forward then backwards and keep doing that til i got to the
window but my mom was like RACHEL JUST GET OUT OF THE CAR AND GET OUR
FOOD! so i was like oooook. so i uhhh..didnt put the car in park i just
got out and left the door open and didnt realize that the car was
moving forward. so i went to the window and the guy who was realllly
hot was laughing and i was like whatttt and he just pointed to my car
so i looked behind me and was like Ommmmmmggggg! so i ran up to the
car, put my foot in it, so i was half way in and was hopping on one
foot while the car was moving then i finally pressed the brake...omg it
was hilarious. then i started laughing and couldnt stop while my poor
little sister was screaming and my mom was yelling at me. the guy in
the window and the ppl in the car behind us were cracking up too.
yes..i know...i am such a loser but oh well it was hiarlious. then my
mom got outta the car and was like we're&nbsp; switching right now u
rnt drivine ne more. so then the guy in the&nbsp; window was like ""just
got her liscense?"" and my mom was like NOOO SHE IS NOT A LISCENSE
DRIVER SHE HAS HER PERMIT! then he started laughing and it was
hilarious. then we finally got to the soccer game. i was the tallest
one compared to all of stephanie's little friends it was pretty funny.
the team they were playing against were HUGE there were even seniors on
the team.&nbsp; so yeah i scored it was sweet. then this girl pushed me
down and this other rolled on top of me? yeah she was pretty weird but
she pissed me off&nbsp; so i gave her dirty looks and stuff. then the
same girl that rolled on top of me grabbed my poor little sister and
pushed her to the ground. i wanted to killlll her. but no..i was nice.
so yeah i&nbsp; got pushed down a lot and it was pretty fun. then after
when we slap hands w. the other team this one girl called me a
bitchhhhh. she was like good game , good game, good game *comes to me *
BITCH&nbsp; yeah i maddddd but i held back my anger..way to go me. and

was so fun!!&nbsp; school was...okkkkk. i couldnt get my locker open bc it was jammed so i had to go to the office and ask to get it fixed...so i was late for bio class oh well. then in math...i got back my test...failed it just like i thoughttttt yeah&nbsp; it wasnt too good
the father is definately gonna be upset over that.&nbsp; then after
school i stayed after and hung out with kayla and we took a lil walk
outsideeeee. then i went home and decided id be a good big sister and
go to my little sisters soccer game. they were playing some 
high school team bc they were like too small to play an actual
highschool and they werent the best either.&nbsp; but they were huge
compared to my poor little sisters 6th and 7th grade team.&nbsp;
stephanie's coach knows me and was like oh rachel i think we have an
extra uniform somewhere in the school will u pleaseeeee play. and i was
like YEAH. so i go with one of stephanie's little friends and we go to
look for a uniform, it took us about a half hour to pull a uniform
together...hahah i looked SOOOO different from everyone else the only
thing that was the same was the jersey...i had one of the boys
basketball shorts on and they had a yellow strip down the middle when
no one else's did, and&nbsp; i was wearing one of the guys gold socks
bc that was all he had when everyone else was wearing black ones...and
i had to wear my tennis shoes...which was hard to play in. so neways it
was sooooooo much fun playing on my little sisters team!! haah they
were sooo bad tho lol. they lost...even tho i was playing with themmmmm
but hey it was still fun. my sisters team has mexicans who board at
their school for 1 year and most of them have never played soccer
before in their life..so yeah they didnt really know a lot of the rules
and stuff. so our team had a goal kick and one of the mexicans didnt
know where the ball went..it was pretty funny. then a girl on the other
team was like laughing was like oh my god i cant blieve she doesnt know
where the ball goes for a goal kick...how pathetic. and she didnt know
i was behind her so she turned around and i was like SHES A MEXICAN ,
ENGLISH ISNT HER 1ST LANGUAGE,&nbsp; AND SHES NEVER PLAYED BEFORE SO
BACK OFF&gt; hahah it was soooooooo funny i got really mad at that girl
too bc she kicked the ball in one of my sisters faces. so yeah it was
extremely fun. </font><br>

yesterdayyyyyyyyy..i had a dance competition and oh boy it sure was
interesting. while i was waiting backstage to go on with a bunch of ppl
during intermission we wanted to go on stage and like practice turning
and stuff like that&nbsp; so i asked the backstage guy if we
could.&nbsp; and he was like umm sure then he grabbed my arm and started rubbing it and was like just...don't let the judges see u. woww
he was definately gay. it was soo funny tho. so then i was like
practicing my back walk over and stuff bc i wasnt sure if i wanted to
do it in my dance and i did it like 5 times so&nbsp; i was like yeah i
can do this. so i go to do my solo and ummmmmm it sucked. i fell outta
my backwalk over&nbsp; ahhh it was terrible. thank god the judges didnt
hear me swearing while i was like falling outta it.&nbsp; then i was
sad and like wasnt trying as much as i should have THEN i saw allison
backstage and she smiled at meeee and it made me happy so i started
trying again. i love u allisonnnnnn. then after my solo i was like
practically having an asthma attack. yeah i was like coughing like
every 5 seconds like nonstop for like an hourrrrr. bc i was retarded
and didnt have my inhalor with meeeee. and water wasnt helping so then
me callie kt and all our moms went out to dinner and i continued
coughing and yeah it was just sucky. i downed 4 waters and 3 sherly
temples then my throat fell better and i stpped coughing. so then we
went back and watched other dances. ohh yeah licked our aliens...kt had

turned around. so it was my turn to PRAY but unfortunately i was not
prepared...bc i didnt know it was my day so i didn't have
anythingggggggg. so i went up there and&nbsp; yeah that was pretty
funny i started cracking up and couldn't stop...mrs. mattera looked
like she wanted to kill mee.&nbsp; then&nbsp; we were working on work
in class and i didn't have my book so i was sharing wth Lynn and mrs.
mattera was like WHERES UR BOOK then she said she wanted to see me
after class...yeah then i was scared for the rest of the hour.&nbsp;

ppl they woulndt shut up and they'd scream during the parts that werent
even scary so like me katie and the guys we met were all yelling at
them to shut up..it was pretty funny...then whenever the scary parts
happened id curl up in a lil ball and rock myself back and forth and
the guy would be looking at me asking katie ""is she alrgiht?????"" it
was soooo funny. SAMARA'S MOM...LOOK!!! ITS MICHEAL JACKSON!!!! lmao!

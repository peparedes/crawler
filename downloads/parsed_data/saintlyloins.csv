"event","It really has been too long since my last update.  And it's not like I've been too busy to update either.  I've just got to get over my intimidation of these online journals.  

Getting up lately has started to get out of control.  I mean, most people set one alarm, maybe hit the snooze button a few times and then haul their ass out of bed.  With little sportswatch I use as an alarm clock, you can actually set three different alarms.  So, while I can't snooze the watch, I'll always set the three alarms within two minutes of each other, and then use the countdown timer to get another 5 minutes of shuteye.  I mean, the whole process takes upwards of 15 minutes.  Maybe I should just pass out earlier....But that would mean I would have to stop browsing Wikipedia late at night.

Damn Wikipedia and it's hotlink addictiveness!!"

"event","As I slowly get up this morning, shaking off the muscles aches brought on my amateur snowboarding and a car accident. Turning on my computer, I found out that a lot had been going on while I was away.  Before anything else...

*intergalactic shout* Merry Christmas!!  And Happy New Year!!

...*ahem*  Sorry 'bout the lateness of that.  Well, the New Year's comment isn't late...yet.  But there is,however, a good chance of me forgetting it.  I don't know if it's the speed of the city and I'm being left behind, but time always seems to slip away from me while I'm living in Tokyo.  Even as I told myself that I would be cleaning my dorm room as soon as I got up, here I am checking livejournal.

Just a quick note before I get started on my cleaning, I just got back from a crazy vacation with three other guys that live in my dorm.  We all drove over to the Nagoya, Nagano region of Japan, antics occurred, and we came back.  I thought I would be able to find a manga cafe at least once during my trip, you know, so I could update on what's been going on (read: let everyone know I'm still alive)....yeah, I didn't quite realize just how back-country this actually was.  Anywho, if anyone is interested in my travels, they can get ahold of me and I'd be more than happy to spin a yarn of grand proportions.  One that might or might not be true.  

But that's how spinning yarns go."

"event","I think I'm beginning to realize that things in my head are never going to be ""ready"" to write down.  Usually I wait for the ideas I think about to simmer a bit in the back of my mind.  When they're ready, something clicks and I know it's done and ready to be said.  Everyday here in Japan things I don't understand just keep coming into my life.  None of it ever simmers to where I want it to be, because new things are always being added to the pot.  I'll just have to make due with what I have.

Smooth Steppers (my dance club) is having a show tomorrow night.  It's a little unusual, first in the fact that it's at a club.  This has a few implications.  First is that we have to pay cover.  Apparently providing entertainment for their guests doesn't waive that fee.  Whatever.  Secondly, because it's a club, the ""show"" doesn't actually start until 1am, and it's supposed to run until 6am.  Our club is supposed to perform at 5am.  I just hope I'm awake at 5am, much less be in a condition to dance.  

Tonight we had our last full practice with all the members in the dance.  Some of the older members (read: senpai) came tonight to watch us.  What went on was a prime example of me not understanding something extremely fundamental in a Japanese social structure.  Usually these older members come to watch and give us a few words of constructive criticism.  We try to correct whatever it was they told us to correct, run the song a few more times, and call it a night.  I understand this.  This makes sense.  

However, the older girls that came in tonight had nothing but negative things to say.  Ok, I can kind of understand this.  We haven't really been working on this show nearly as long as we did for the first show.  There are probably a lot of spots that need work.  But this one girl in particular wouldn't stop.  She verbally drove every spot of our show into the ground.  The two girls that created this show started crying, and this girl still went on.  The show highlights four different dancing genre (locking, hip-hop, breaking, and jazz) and she berated all of it.  The second half of the dance has everyone in it, and she criticized that to death as well.  It completely destroyed the fun and positive atmosphere that we had.  

I could maybe understand this if it happened a week or two before the show.  This girl could have wanted to get everyone mad in order to motivate them to work harder.  But the night before the show?  What are we supposed to do?  All she managed to do was make our two leaders breakdown, and kill the atmosphere that we had enjoyed.  It was pure negativity.  

I don't like negativity.  Even when I don't about negative subjects with friends, we're usually joking about it.  A favorite topic of conversation between me and my friends is the weird kids in our Japanese classes.  But even when we're talking about them, it's usually joking around.  I don't even like to be around negativity, if I can help it.  But apparently this berating that happened tonight is nothing out of the ordinary.  

This is a prime example of a facet of Japan that I just haven't even begun to comprehend."

"event","I hear laughter echoing down the halls of my dorm.  I would join in, I really would.  You know, if it weren't for the fact that I'm so jet lagged right now. (>_<) 

I went back to the states for about 10 days during fall break.  Things went pretty good.  I spent most of my time driving around with random friends that I have out there.  None of my friends are in the same group, or know each other, so I see them individually.  This can take a lot of time and money spent at fast-food places.  But, it was fun.  Part of my master plan of going back to the states was to gorge myself silly on things like pizza, in-n-out, mexican food, and steak (in that order), so....gorging complete.  Show me another slice of pizza and I'll smash your face in it.  Mission accomplished!

Due to temporary medical (shitty prescription ""suggestions"") circumstances, I'm not allowed to drink alcohol for two weeks.  When I first looked at the bottle, I was like ""you know, that's not going to be so bad.""  Then immediately I had a flashback to my last week before I went back to the states.  I was at izakaya's.  Every.  Night.  

I'm not an alcoholic.  I swear I'm not.  I went back to the states, barely drank, and felt no craving for the bottle.  It's just that drinking at public places is the sure-fire way to make Japanese friends.  Seriously.  It's like a hack mode.  You can play through the game normally and go through the long (emphasize long) and often arduous process of making friends in Japan.  Or, you can turn on cheat mode, give 'em a few beers and you've got instant friends for the night.  Alcohol produces such a complete reversal in personality, it's scary.  

...what the hell am I going to do?"

"event","Once again I find myself up at 4am with nothing much to do. I got back from Gusto (the Japanese equivilant of Denny's) a few hours ago. Josh, Jin, Theo, and I were supposed to be studying Japanese, but drifted off into other conversation. We eventually just left and then talked more outside of Global House. This is my life during finals. I usually restrain myself from blatently going out with friends, so do it under the guise of studying. You all should know better, I'm not really studying... (^_~) 

I really hope my club starts up activities again soon. While I was practicing for the student festival, I would only go out and drink maybe once every few weeks. I was busy with practice every night, I didn't have any free time. But now that the festival is over, I'm out drinking three times a week. It's not that I'm an alcoholic. I'm really not. No, seriously... It's just that drinking is a very social activity in Japan. Much more so than it is back home in America. Drinking is the only time that Japanese people are socially allowed to lower their guard, so they try to do it as much as they can. 

This weekend was recovery. Friday night I went out to drink with some friends at our favorite (cheapest) bar near the school. After 11pm, drinks are half off we got there around 11:30pm. We stayed until the bar closed at 1am, and then proceeded to another bar, which we stayed at until it closed at 5am. Really, I didn't mean to stay out that late, but it was a good group of people and we were having fun. 

Ok, I know the English in this post is a little awkward. I can usually do better than this. It's a combination of it being 4am right now, and since coming to Japan, my English (especially my written English) has become somewhat less than fluent. I've started to do things like construct my English sentences with Japanese grammar. This is not good. Pictures are up. I finally got around to posting pictures from my Okinawa vacation.

"event","Long time no see, everyone.

There's been reasons for my long absence.  Some of them are valid, I think, while others are just...well, there are no others.  Just laziness.  The (valid) reason I haven't posted is because I was trying to figure out how to write in one of these online blog things.  But seriously, I've been doing it for a long time now, what's the deal?  Truth is, I've always been walking the line between telling too much and telling too little.  I mean, I've definitely seen online blogs where people just tell WAY too much about themselves, to the point where my opinion of them changes dramatically.  I mean, there is just some stuff that you need to keep to yourself.  Or at least, within a close circle of friends.  Everyone and their mother on the internet does not need to know every privy about your inner self.  They don't WANT to know.  Neither do I.  On the flip side, if you tell too little, there's no point to keeping one of these online journals at all, really.

So one of my American friends here gives me this tip last night.  He said:

 ""my rule of thumb is...if i have no shame in talking about it in a busy restaurant, then it's fine.  if i wouldn't say it in a restaurant where someone would hear me, then it doesn't go in an online journal.""  

Pretty good advice, I'd say.  So, using this newfound rule of thumb, I'm going to try another crack at it.  Seriously, I've stopped and started online journals so many times, it's dizzying.  I'm hoping this time it'll stick and I'll keep doing it.  

Rules of thumb are pretty useful.  I think one of the most useful ones I've come across was something I heard over the summer.  All the foreigners were confused about the garbage sorting in Japan.  You have to sort the garbage between, P.E.T Bottles (plastic bottles) and cans, which is not so bad.  But then you have to also sort the rest between combustible and noncombustible.  I mean, what the hell does that really mean?  But we figured it out!  If you think it would smell alright when you burn it, into the combustible bin it goes.  If you think the smell would make you vacate the area, noncombustible baby!  Anywho, that was a random tangent. 

Finals are all this next week.  I have a paper to write, a calligraphy project to put together, and a four-day long Japanese test.  Yes kids, a four-day long test.  I don't make this shit up.  Davis kids, you think Japanese back home gives it to you in the behind?  The Japanese class here finds holes I didn't even know I had and rapes them. 

 But hey, because it's Japanese, I don't mind that much."

"event","Did you ever see those movies where all the animals are high-tailing out of the forest because of some natural disaster while the thick-headed hero continues onwards?  I ain't gonna be that guy.  

Alright.  The time has come to flee with the rest of the animals.  I just check the super-ultra-infared-high definition radar like thingy at weather.com, and the typhoon that's coming does not look fun.  In fact, it just looks like a massive swirling blob.  BIGGER THAN JAPAN.  I do not want to be here when this thing hits.  Not that I'm really fearing for my life or anything.  I'm sure I can hole up in some bed and breakfast type place for a few days.  I AM pissed however, because we just found an awesome campgrounds and while we stayed there last night, I would like to stay there more.  

But anywho, I digress...  I'm just saying 'fuck it' to the whole situation and evacuating the island.  The tricky part is how I'm going to go about doing that.  

Because of the taifu (actual spelling, bitches) most of the boats leaving the island have been cancelled.  The ones still remaining have already been booked by my sneaky islander neighbors.  This means that only uneconomical first class accommodations are left and yours truely doing his best to find a way off this island without losing the shirt off his back in the process.  

Other than that, things have been good.  This vacation is really the first extended vacation I've taken with friends. And I must say, it has made a difference.  We don't make plans until the day they take place.  No itineraries.  Fuck itineraries.  

Last night we stayed at that awesome campgrounds.  Since we've been here, we've all been wanting to have a beach party.  Apparently the Japanese people have never put beach and alcohol together, and therefore beach bar technology has yet to be developed.  Well, in our desperate attempt for a beach party, we bought $60 worth of beer (about 40-50 cans), a few bags of ice, and just started randomly inviting people from the campground down to the beach.  Less than ten minutes and a bonfire later, we had a kickin' party going that lasted until very very late.  What lesson has this taught us?

If you bring beer, they will come."

"event","I don't know if you know this, but usually when you go to the bathroom in Japan, there are no paper towels.  I know that this cuts down on consumer waste, but I see no real good alternative to paper towels.  Unless you have the hyper-jet-engine-hand-dryers, paper towels in the bathroom are a necessary evil.  I guess when you get down to it, there is really just a difference in thinking.  There are tons of examples of things that Japan does, or ways of doing things, that I think are just dumb.  For example, why are the ATM's not open 24 hours?  Why are there no public trashcans?  These are just ""paper towel things.""  

But, in thinking about all these 'different' ways that Japan handles things, I've begun to think about America, about home.  I've been inadvertently thinking about things I miss.  At first, it was just the food.  I miss real pizza, I miss real Mexican food, I miss real salads.  I mean, Japan has all of these things, they've just thrown their own little twist on it.  I'm still wonder who the dude was that thought it would be a great idea to put salad and/or salad items on pizza.  And since when did Caesar salad NOT come with Caesar salad dressing? 

Whatever.  These things don't irritate me.  At least, not much.  But, the thing is that thinking about the great food at home has led me to think of other great things about home.  I never really thought of America as home when I lived there.  I always thought that I would have to travel around a lot in order to find a place that feels like home.  Perhaps it's in order to realize that it may be my home after all.  

On an unrelated topic, I'm very excited about moving out of Canada House and the subsequent heat.  As much as I love the group of guys here, living on the third floor of a non-AC building has taken a bit of toll on my health."

"event","I don't think I really play by the same rules as a lot of people.  I know I said I wasn't going to talk about relationships on this journal, but you know what?  Important rules are those that are made to be broken.  

I'm not really frustrated by the games that people play.  We love the games.  That's why we play them.  If they became boring, or if we became disinterested, the games would stop being played.  A majority of people view relationships as a ""do or don't"" kind of thing.  You are either a friend or a boyfriend or an acquaintance or a girlfriend or an ex or something that has a clearly defined label.  I don't think I really feel that need.  I've had people tell me that once they change their mind about someone and shift their thinking about somebody from boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other to friend, that's it.  You are hereby kicked off the ladder of love and never allowed back on.  

I just can't believe that kind of thinking.  People and their relationship to you are constant changing.  People are always in a flux of drifting apart or getting closer.  But, those clearly defined labels don't account for that.  There is no grey area with those boyfriend/girlfriend terms.  That's why I don't like them.  If I ever want to change from being with someone platonically to being with someone romantically, social status has to change.  But, instead of small, gradual changes, you're forced into black and white labels.  And people get pissed if you want to change too much.

That's another thing that bothers me.  I don't like people who make my business their business.  I consider those matters to be private things.  It bothers me, like sandpaper fraying my nerves, when I think other people are watching me and judging me.  

--Go to hell!"" or other insult direct is all the answer a snoopy question rates--

The way I think about a relationship is simple.  The other person is merely someone who chooses to spend time with me every day.  The day that changes and she would rather spend time with someone else, then it changes.  I just dislike binding ties.  They're always painful when broken.  And if you have enough confidence in yourself, you don't really need them.

Maybe that sounds contradictory to some people: that I dislike the strictness of direct relationship labels, but I treasure the privacy of a relationship.  Personally, I just feel like the way I think about relationships is just very different from most people.  I'm sure someday I'll meet someone who thinks the way I do about this.  I just hope it's sooner rather than later."

"event","This summer session is about half over.  They only way that I knew that it was half over was because I checked a calander.  Since I didn't intuitively know it, that means that time has been passing pretty quick.  It also means I've been having a damn good time.

This is something that I've never really had before.  That is, my camaraderie with the Canada house boys.  I've never really been close to guys, or had many male friends.  At least until this year, most of my friends have been female.  I just tend to get along with them better.  I started to have a small group of guy friends at the beginning of college.  That was disbanded the next year when one guy went abroad and the other dropped out of college.  Now, this last year I've had male companionship again (even picked up a twin!) and then now with the boys of Canada house, I'm really happy to have guy friends.  I know this may sound like an insignificant issue with a lot of people, but to me, it means a lot.  I'm really happy now that I wasn't put in Global House during the summer.   Even if it is a lot cleaner and has air conditioning.  I'll make you rue that air conditioning!!.......start ruing!!!!

I'm feeling very antisocial tonight.  I had a pretty fun day out in Shibuya, Harajuku, and Kichijoji today.  Hina, Dave (UK Dave), Dave (street Dave) and I all hung out as we bummed around, shopped, took purikura, and just had general craziness.  I think I should be feeling quite social right now, after all that.  But, I don't.  I just feel anti-social.  

I think some comments rubbed me the wrong way earlier.  One of the guys in Canada house, an especially hard-working and somewhat elitist (in my opinion) told me he was going to (unnecessarily, in my opinion) study up on some keigo (or formal language) since he was going to be meeting with some older Japanese people in class.  I jokingly told him that I just would tell the older Japanese people that I can't use keigo and ask them to please forgive me.  Hell, even normal Japanese kids our age can't use keigo.  They only learn it when they get a job at a company.  But he replied with something to the effect of ""I don't want to be like that.""...Fuck you dude.  We all work our ass of studying this language.  You don't need to be an elitist ass who is fretting being brought down to ""our level"".  I'm usually a fan of elitists (me being somewhat of one myself), but don't put other people down because of it.  

.....k, that's out of my system.  

I periodically get my anti-social spurts.  I'm usually a very social person.  'Cept tonight."

"event","The closer I get to enlightenment, the more I feel like I've lived this life already. 

Essentially, I have.  When viewing time from a ""movie reel"" construct, this live has already occured.  It is pieced full of problems and situations that would force me to learn and grow, with plenty of fun thrown in.  Well, I guess my level of fun is my ability to not take the problems and situations too seriously.  In viewing life from a top-down, or ""movie reel"" construct, you must see it was you would see a movie.  Time, your time, has been created.  You're merely watching it right now.  Sure, you change what happens, as we all have free will.   But certain major events will still take place.  The more I come to terms with this way of thinking, the more I'm able to jump a few frames ahead every now and again.  It's random and awkward at best.  I'm still convinced this is part of de ja vu.

My forehead has been acting up again.  In the last two days, there has been constant activity there.  I'm not sure what it means.  I've felt it in spurts.  I seem to notice though a corrilation between remembering certain truths and forehead tinglings."

"event","Before I continue on with this livejournal experiment, I`m going to make one thing perfectly clear.  None of my love life will appear on this site.  Reason for this, it`s none of your fucking business.  I crossed back and forth on this subject when I posted on xanga, but I will waver no more.  Telling selective bits of the truth is still the truth, and sometimes lies are more sincere (and more interesting) than the truth.  You take what you can get.  Or you can shove it.

Sorry, had to get that out of me.  And before I go any further, let me say that Japanese keyboards are not for the intended use of English typers.  I`m having to learn to hit the spacebar with my left thumb, and hunt down Mr. Apostrophe every time I want to use him.  Which, in the land of conjunctions, is frequent.  

Things are well, as well as they could be.  I took the overnight bus with Niban from Tokyo to Osaka.  Since we`re college students, and I don`t want my parents to notice my expenditures too much, we took the getto bus instead of the shinkansen, or bullet train for those not in the know.  The first third of the trip I had a grueling match with my lungs.  I was trying not to hack and cough all over my cute-bookish-Japanese-young-woman-of-a-neighbor, but I AM pretty sick.  And I know what you`re thinking, `looks like Nick sat next to the cute one on purpos, trying to get his mack on and such.` That would be a`negative, as we had assigned seats, and I usually wait until I`m sufficiently well and healthy to start `prowling` as my grandfather put it.  Yes, he was a prowler as well.

By the time we reached the first rest stop and convenience store, I knew the true value of cough drops.  A few cough drops later and I was passed out on the bus, cough free and my head bent at an awkward angle.  

When we arrived in Osaka at 6am, Niban and I walked around for a bit looking for some decent breakfast.  Let me just say that 6am is a prime time for shady characters of both sexes to be walking around.  After settling on curry, medicine {for me} and water, we make our way to where we are now. 24 hour Manga Kissen.

These places kick ass!  For a pretty cheap price, you get to chill in a big recliner in your own booth, with computer, PS2, tv for movies, and all the manga/magazines/porn you could possibly want.  You can also get free drinks, non-alcoholic of course {sorry guys, this isn`t nomihoudai} pillows, use of shower facilities.  Basically, the works.  So now, as I am pretty tired and sick, I will bid you farewell, as I need some shuteye.  Pictures later."

"event","Hello LiveJournal! *shakes hands*  Xanga wasn't doing it for me, so I'm going to hang out with you for awhile.  Yoroshiku~

This morning was hellish waking up.  After a full 12 hour day in the city, first with Maki, then with the boys from Canada house, my cold has progressed from noticeable to downright annoying.  I rarely get colds, and when I do, I'm usually pretty good about taking care of myself.  Welcome to Japan.  Now, when I get a cold, I'm pissed and as impatient as ganguro (those ugly bleached hair/burnt skin japanese girls) waiting for purikura (photo booth plus acid trip).  I skipped my last two classes this morning because I just needed to rest.  Now that I took a nice three hour nap, I actually feel good, except for a gagging pain in my throat.  

I never thought I would say Japanese girl and ugly in the same sentence, but this new fashion trend of girls bleaching their hair and burning their skin is just gross.  I'm seriously, I never thought I would ever see people try so hard to make themselves uglier.  These are good looking girls that would tempt my inner pedophile if they didn't go and make themselves so ugly.  Maybe they knew I was coming to Japan, got scared, and resorted to desperate measures...

I wonder how this Osaka trip is going to go.  I think if I dope myself up on enough Japanese-style Dayquil, then I should be fine.  Kevin and I are taking the overnight bus, so that's where all my napping (as opposed to sleeping) is going to take place.  I can always sleep all day on Monday after class.  

Short entry for my first one.

Quote from last night:

Eugene: Man, I feel sorry for you tall guys.  You know that tall people die younger, because their heart has to pump that much harder.

Paul: Oh yes, all that sex we get for being tall is going to make it pump a lot harder."

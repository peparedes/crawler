"event","I actually saw Avengers on its opening night a couple of weeks ago. I&#39;m dying to go see it again! It&#39;s rare for a much-hyped movie to actually live up to its hype, but I think it&#39;s actually the case here. It&#39;s amazing what can happen when you put an actual writer on one of these blockbuster smashes.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how anyone can beat Ironman (who has the most screen time, the best quips, and just about any AC/DC song you can think of as his personal entrance music), but the movie did a great job of showcasing everybody (with the possible exception of Thor, who still had a great one-liner just for good measure).<br /><br />Still, as much as I like Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, my favorite line from the movie had to be from Cap: &quot;<span style=""color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "">All right, listen up!

"event","It&#39;s time for me to really get back to writing, and that means posting here somewhat more regularly.<br /><br />I do have some great news! I already have a contract for next year at the same great place I&#39;m teaching this year. I&#39;m even going to be teaching 2nd graders again, so I already have a solid start. This year has been so awesome, and I&#39;m pretty fired up about some of the stuff I&#39;m going to be adding in the coming year. Now, if the end of the year testing (which begins next week) is as good for my current class as I&#39;m expecting, this year will truly be one of the best years of my life. I am scheduled to take a two week class in June (where they are actually paying me to take it, is that crazy or what?), but the rest of my summer is looking pretty free.<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""On to other stuff...""><br />On to other stuff...<br /><br /><b>What I&#39;m Writing: </b>I&#39;m in the early stages of an adventure for &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot;, which I&#39;m calling &quot;Hunter&#39;s Island&quot;. I&#39;m still trying to figure out the exact format of the thing, but in general I want it to be an adventure/villain/bestiary sourcebook. I&#39;ve got some great ideas, the only real problem I&#39;m experiencing (other than sitting down and typing away at it) is working in some hints of future products. I&#39;m also initially working in Word instead of Googledocs, which is improving my output significantly over &quot;Spy Racers&quot;. I vow that this will not take two years to get out! After &quot;Hunter&#39;s Island&quot;, I will move on to &quot;Submariners&quot;, my underwater sourcebook for &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies.&quot;<br /><br /><b>Other Stuff:</b> Believe it or not, GenCon is right around the corner. The events listing is up and event registration is nearly upon us. I&#39;m going to be running three events, all of them on Saturday and all of them &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot; related. I&#39;ve got some great ideas for all three. For the traditional Ministry Q event, I&#39;m planning on hacking the plot from the pathetic &quot;Devil May Care&quot; James Bond novel into something with Ultraspy goodness. The villain in that work has ape-like hands, where my villain will have ape-like arms! I&#39;m going to be doing a Speed Racer episode retread for &quot;Submariners&quot;. I&#39;m also introducing a new event for &quot;Agents of DEAD&quot;, which is my take on the darker side of the &#39;60s (a la Twilight Zone and Outer Limits). I&#39;m pretty sure the adventure is going to have something to do with zombies (but my own special take on zombies, which will kick the living crap out of the traditional Romero ones). This one is going to take the most work, since I need characters and background writeups.<br /><br /><b>What I&#39;m Reading: </b>I have become enamored of a &quot;Young Readers&quot; author by the name of Matthew Cody. On a whim at my daughter&#39;s book sale, I picked up his novel called &quot;Powerless&quot;, and discovered he had a seriously great take on the superhero genre. I recently bought his book &quot;The Dead Gentleman&quot;, which is his take on Steam Punk/Time Travel. &nbsp;While I love the main characters (including a hella scary villain) and the setting, the plot is a little too much &quot;stuff happening to the characters&quot; rather than &quot;characters making stuff happen&quot;. Still, for some absolutely marvelous gaming ideas, it&#39;s hard to go wrong with some of the stuff being produced by authors in the &quot;Young Readers&quot; (Grades 5-7) category.<br /><br /><b>What I&#39;m Watching:</b> I finally got into the more recent Doctor Who stuff on Netflix, and burned through about six years worth of stuff in a little over a month. This is truly amazing for me to say, but I think that David Tennant is the best Doctor Who ever (even if the end of his run was fairly weak). The saying is that your favorite Doctor is the one you grew up with, and for the longest time I would tell you that Tom Baker was the Doctor for me. Now, I&#39;m looking to get into another scifi series on Netflix. I&#39;m trying Farscape, but it&#39;s been pretty slow going at the beginning.<br /><br />Other than that, my family is outstanding. My wife has started working in a new area at her hospital. My oldest daughter scored a 31 on her ACTs and is looking at colleges (She&#39;s a high school senior next year). My youngest daughter is set to become the ruling class at her school, moving into the 6th grade. My cat is awesome and currently curled up and purring at my side. I&#39;ve inherited two of the cutest guinea pigs you have ever seen as class pets. Life is pretty darn good.<br /><br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br />"

"event","Okay, it&#39;s been quite a while since I posted here. Maybe we should start with a general update.<br /><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Lots of life details follow..."">Last April, I got some bad news. The charter school where I was teaching was not going to be offering me a contract for the next school year. &nbsp;The official line was &quot;behavior management concerns&quot;, although that didn&#39;t seem to make sense to almost anyone with whom I had worked. This was particularly baffling considering I had made 100% of the bonuses they had set up based on student scores and teaching observations.<br /><br />Still, I decided I would make the best of it. The good news was that the teaching job market was way better than the previous year, with many, many more opportunities. I had 3 interviews, but unfortunately I had no response from any of them by the time the new school year was about to get underway.<br /><br />I decided to go with substitute teaching (which I had pretty much expected to be doing a year earlier anyway). I went with a service that provided substitutes for charter schools across the cities. We had used them at my previous charter school. At first, it was very slow. I only got four placements in my first two weeks.<br /><br />Having time to sit around and think about my situation was not a good thing. Before it was over, I had signed up as a substitute for three nearby districts, applied for a job at a local convenience store chain, and even visited one of those day labor places.<br /><br />Everything started rolling along after that. I found substitute teaching to be pretty fun, once you got beyond the mad scramble, wait to see if anyone needs you, walk into the unknown part of the job. I made a couple of great connections at charter schools at which I wouldn&#39;t mind eventually working. Teachers were starting to request me. Also, I did get that convenience store job over the weekend to help supplement any shortfalls I might have had during the week in addition to the times I knew I wouldn&#39;t be working (holiday and summers).<br /><br />Then, a fateful Wednesday in mid-October happened. &nbsp;I came home from what had been a pretty terrible 3rd grade class, probably my worse substitute assignment to date (and they were actually happy with my performance, but more on that later). I noticed on my caller ID that a friend and co worker from my previous charter school had called me. She had moved on to a different charter school in the area, and we had briefly talked and exchanged some files we had worked on together the previous year. She hadn&#39;t left a message, but since she had just tried calling me 5 minutes before, I decided I would give her a call back.<br /><br />&quot;Are you still looking for a job?&quot; she asked. &quot;Submit your resume to this email address now.&quot; I quickly did it and almost immediately got a call back from her principal, asking if I would like to substitute teach at their school for the next two days with the possibility of being brought in permanently.<br /><br />Now I had already set up something at my youngest daughter&#39;s school for the next day, but with the possibility of permanent work, I would have to cancel it (at the risk of being blacklisted there!). Somewhere in the flurry of calls between the principal, my previous co-worker, and my daughter&#39;s school, I got a call from the teacher I had been a substitute for that day (remember the bad third grade class?) wondering if I could fill in for her again because she had pneumonia (I had to tell her sorry but no).<br /><br />So, what was going on at this charter school suddenly in desperate need of a teacher? Apparently, they were bringing in my previous co-worker to the kindergarten class to model classroom management for that teacher (she is one of the best teachers I&#39;ve ever seen at handling urban students) when the kindergarten teacher decided she had enough and just quit.<br /><br />Now, they wanted my co-worker to take over the supposedly rowdy kindergarten, and they would bring someone for her well-behaved second graders. She made a strong recommendation for me. I came in and substitute taught for two days, was offered a contract for the rest of the year that Friday, and the rest is history.<br /><br />I am now the teacher of an absolutely fabulous group of second graders (already broken in very nicely by my previous and once again current co-worker). I even inherited two class guinea pigs!<br /><br />The only problem I have in my life right now is that I&#39;m still working at that convenience store over the weekends. The work is easy and I feel a strange sense of loyalty to them, so I haven&#39;t been able to bring myself to quit there, but it does sometimes make for working many days in a row (my record so far has been 21 straight days after Black Friday).</lj-cut><br />"

"event","The next writing project I am working on is called &quot;Racing Spies.&quot; I originally intended it to be something of a supplement/brand new thing dealing with '60s spies for QAGS, much along the lines of &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies.&quot; Since that initial conception, however, some things have changed.<br /><br /><lj-cut>First, a big chunk of &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot; got cut. Specifically, it was the vehicle and chase rules. Conveniently enough, that is exactly the same grounds I planned on covering for &quot;Racing Spies,&quot; just more geared towards racing and spies of course.<br /><br />Second, Hex Games released a product called &quot;Cops and Robbers,&quot; which also covered vehicle and chase rules. I based my own vehicle and chase rules on a previous Hex Games product called &quot;Rocket Jocks.&quot; Unfortunately, the rules in &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; differed fairly significantly from these, and I feel I should adapt what I have done to better match &quot;Cops and Robbers.&quot;<br /><br />Third, and finally, I've taken a good hard look at the racing spy genre itself, mostly at its general popularity. My &quot;Racing Spies&quot; convention events are generally the most poorly attended ones that I run. The Wachowski brothers made a reasonably decent film about Speed Racer and it bombed. The undeniable truth of the matter is no matter how infatuated I am with Speed Racer and Racer X in particular, it has a fairly limited audience appeal (and it didn't even cost me $120 million dollars to figure that out like the Wachowskis).<br /><br />I really want my follow up to &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot; to be successful. So, I have decided to focus &quot;Racing Spies&quot; less on the the racing spy stuff and treat it much more as a Vehicle and Chase supplement for &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies.&quot; Keeping this in mind, I'm going to simplify &nbsp;and align the vehicle design rules more in accordance with &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot;. I'm going to simplify the chase rules to some extent (while still keeping all those nifty chase tables). I'm going to present organizations and an adventure that the Ultraspies from &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot; will be more than comfortable participating in.<br /><br />I've really been debating how to get myself fired up to get back to writing &quot;Racing Spies,&quot; and I think I'm starting to figure it out.<br /><br />&nbsp;</lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;Well, since I've updated my livejournal about my life, I might as well start updating about my writing and gaming.<br /><br />Last August, Hex Games released <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies </em>in .pdf format (you can find it <a href=""http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=82744"">here</a>). It has apparently generated decent enough sales (It was the hottest item for Hex Games on rpgnow until recently getting supplanted by their <em>Frat Boys Vs.</em> game. Of course, I don't think it ever got above 12th on their sister drivethrurpg site, but go figure.) It has also received some favorable buzz on Hex Games forums. I'm anxiously awaiting the first official review for it.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Designer Note Stuff"">In a perfect world, I would have used this livejournal to post a type of Designer Notes for <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em> immediately or very soon after it was released. I enjoy reading this type of thing (just as an insight into what the author is thinking), but I can also understand those who are completely uninterested and are put off by having to pay for something like it (when it is included in the actual product). Posting it online would seem to offer the best of both worlds.<br /><br />Since I couldn't get it done in a timely manner, this will have to suffice.<br /><br /><em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em> is something I was born to write. I know, I know, you were probably born to write anything you've actually wrote. Still, I feel uniquely qualified to have done <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em>. You see, I'm a '60s spy fanatic. While I'm too young to have watched it first hand on television and the movies, I definitely caught the reruns. One of the first movies I can remember watching on TV was James Bond's <em>Thunderball</em>. In high school, I was obsessed with <em>The Avengers</em>, catching it whenever I could in reruns. Later, I even collected the entire VHS collection of the Emma Peel years, and a good smattering of the Cathy Gale and Tara King episodes.<br /><br />As far as roleplaying games are concerned, the very first one that I owned was <strong>Top Secret </strong>(although I did hear about D&amp;D first). I was never into the fantasy genre (I could barely make it through <em>The Hobbit</em>, forget about <em>Lord of the Rings</em>). Of course, I collected the entire <strong>007 Roleplaying Game</strong> line. <strong>Spycraft </strong>was even the game that eventually made me decide to purchase 3rd Edition D&amp;D.<br /><br />One of the things I've noticed with the more recent roleplaying games about spies was a tendency to fall into one of two traps. <br /><br />The first is what I call the Cold War trap. The Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union was a dominant political and social force during the '60s. It's all too easy to assume '60s spies would be directly concerned with that aspect as well. I almost fell into this trap while I was writing <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em> myself. In looking back at the genre, however, '60s spies tried their best to avoid dealing with the Cold War at all. The threats tended to be shadowy organizations, often led by individuals with Eastern European accents, but never coming right out and claiming sides.<br /><br />In order to have <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em> avoid the Cold War and better emulate the genre, I created an incident and a truce between the two sides of the Cold War. I'm definitely planning on focusing on Cold War anxiety in a future supplement.<br /><br />The second trap is what I will call the Austin Powers trap, since that character is the most recent and familiar of the '60s spy farces to have come along. For some reason, the spy genre makes for excellent farce. For one thing, I believe because it is so rooted in our own real world, the spy genre can always dial back up to more seriousness and reality. <br /><br />To give a better example, I have a hard time watching any western and seeing cowboys sitting around a campfire and not think about the scene from <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, no matter how serious the movie is trying to be. <em>Blazing Saddles</em> has seriously impacted my ability to watch any western with a serious mind. On the other hand, watching James Bond talk into a miniature radio doesn't necessarily always make me think of Maxwell Smart talking into his shoe. I would argue that spy farces have been among the most successful of any genre farce in history. You have Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Maxwell Smart, and Austin Powers are prime exhibits.<br /><br />Still, for the most part '60s spies were meant to be reasonably serious, with an occasional foray into wit and amusement. Again, there are certainly enough counter examples that I am strongly considering doing a farce supplement for <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies </em>in the future as well.<br /><br />As far as actual game design is concerned, my main philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible. I have really grown to appreciate the QAGS system. I've been a fan of too many other systems (<strong>Champions </strong>and <strong>BESM </strong>come to mind) that became bloated an ultra complicated. Any rule I introduced I wanted to make sure that there was an easier, if less structured, way to do it as well. So, I came up with the easy way, and the slightly more complex way, and it seems to have been accepted by QAGS fans.<br /><br />Next up, I plan on completing <em>Racing Spies</em>, a supplement for <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em>. I write more about where I'm headed with that product next.</lj-cut>"

"event","<br />&nbsp;Long time, no post. Well, I might as well update my life situation at this point. <br /><br /><lj-cut>For anyone that missed the references in my GenCon postings, I did get a job as a first grade teacher at a charter school in Minneapolis. That job started right away in August, and has kept me pretty busy since then. One of the philosophies of this particular charter school is longer school days (the actual school day goes from 8:30 to 5, I'm usually in by 7:30) and a longer school year (we started classes in mid-August and will go to the first day in July, effectively making us year round).<br /><br />So far, I've found teaching to be a tiring but definitely worthwhile endeavor. My class is almost looking like what I would consider a first grade class should look like, and we've started getting a lot of compliments from onlookers. I've felt very well supported by my administration (I have a wonderful, highly experienced teacher's assistant in addition to a paraprofessional for one of my students, and there have been numerous suspensions which seem to have proven the point to most of my class that I'm the one in charge).<br /><br />And yes, the days are very long and the pressure to perform is great (For example, I will give my first graders four quizzes tomorrow, one spelling, one timed computational math, one conceptual math, and one language arts. This is pretty much the drill every week except when we do the bigger unit tests, which begin next week. Remember this is first grade!). Still, I really don't think it's any greater than what I came from in the corporate retail world (and so much more fulfilling for me). Even though I work longer hours and more days than regular school teachers, I still remind myself that I get 9+ weeks of vacation (one week at Thanksgiving, two weeks at Christmas, one week at Easter, four weeks in July, and five Paid Time Off days, plus all of the regular holidays). I've never worked at a job before where I had more than three. I also have almost every night free with my family.<br /><br />So, I'm slowly but surely getting a grip on this teaching thing. I've decided to get back to posting to my livejournal because I find it's a good way to get me started writing, and I'm comfortable enough where I'm at in my new profession to spend a little time writing. So, more to come. First up, where I've been in writing games.</lj-cut>"

"event","&nbsp;After all my preparations for GenCon to try and make sure whoever is running the events I signed up for (and cannot make) go extremely well, I've had some gaming burnout. I was planning on going to Mage-Con in Sioux City over Labor Day weekend (and this year, I'll actually be able to attend a larger chunk of it since I'm not working retail anymore). Usually, I run a miniature war game event, but after all of the work I put in for GenCon (even when I'm not going to be there), I was feeling pretty burned out. I figured I would go just as a player this year, since they seem to need more players than gamemasters anyhow.

In talking with my brother-in-law last night, he managed to convince me otherwise. So, I'm going to not only run my AK47 Republic stuff in Modern Africa, but I'm also going to try a role playing event for the first time there (Jawgrinder, which I already have prepared conveniently enough from GenCon). Hopefully, his enthusiasm will transfer over to me sometime during this month."

"event","&nbsp;I've really been in a &quot;Jawgrinder&quot; kind of mode lately. I've become obsessed with the so-called &quot;Iron Age&quot; of comic books, particularly its most notorious artist (and I guess you could call him a writer as well). I've picked up two superhero book collections recently: <em>X-Force Cable: The Legend Returns</em> and <em>X-Force Shatterstar</em>. <br /><br />The first is a collection from when Marvel apparently welcomed Mr. Liefeld back to try and revive a book (X-Force) that they had pretty much destroyed. It is absolutely what I expected, which is that wacky meant-to-be-serious-but-absolutely-hysterical combination of in your face graphics and absurd storyline. Everybody talks tough and fights a lot (even each other). In the book, Cable returns and collects a motley &quot;team&quot; to battle the most vicious threat to mutant kind that nobody had ever heard of before or since, an alien with the wonderfully&nbsp;misspelled&nbsp;name of &nbsp;Skornn. Domino starts the story off, then a future version of herself makes an appearance dressed up as the supervillain Stryfe in a homoerotic wet dream kind of way, ending with the original (or was it the future self, I'm so confused). The Shi'Ar Imperial Guard check up on things just so Rob can draw some cool looking spaceships. Deadpool makes an appearance for no apparent reason other than to say that he was there. Fantastic stuff!<br /><br />The second book starts off with a story which leads up to the first book, where Shatterstar, the what-the-hell-are-you-doing-hanging-around-with-mutants-pretending-you're-one-of-them-when-your-really-a-genetically-enhanced-freak-from-another-dimension warrior, must fight to obtain the weapon which will eventually destroy Skornn (but not really). Unfortunately, the artwork is not by Mr. Liefeld, so it's not nearly as good (in a bad way). He is listed as the &quot;plotter&quot; of the story, so I'm guessing he must have explained his vision to someone who tried to hammer it into something sensible. It's okay, but I wouldn't have wasted my money on it for that part. The really fantastic part of the book is in the last half, which features the last three episodes of The New Mutants before X-Force was launched. Of course, these are all done by Mr. Liefeld, and are incredible (if you are as obsessed as I am). It's like the start of a super hero roleplaying game where you have to somehow mash everyone's individual story lines into some kind of cohesion, and don't quite succeed that makes any sense, but at least everyone is together and fighting things (including each other). Shatterstar and Feral make their first appearance, replacing Rictor and Sunspot on the team, and there's that glorious moment where Stryfe reveals himself to be Cable at the very end. I was almost squealing with joy at the memories of my&nbsp;misspent&nbsp;youth!"

"event","Well, for those who may not know, I got good news and bad news recently. The good news is that I have been hired as a teacher for this coming school year. The bad news is that I start my duties right away in August, so I will not be able to attend GenCon this year. This will be the first time I have not gone to GenCon in 23 years!<br /><br />This caused a mad scramble to try and get someone to run my four spots for Hex Games (which they did). I also felt obligated to put together some pretty concrete material for this nice person, so I've been hammering away at that for a few weeks now. I'd thought I'd post some of the stuff I've put together just for a teaser.

Players will design their own &quot;kewl&quot; superheroes using the QAGS system. Each player will randomly pick five different cards (from 80 different ones, this is only nine of them). As you can see, each card has a number (which will be used for the stats) and some ideas regarding Names, Jobs, Gimmicks, and Weaknesses. I really like the way they turned out, and I hope these cards not only make character creation super easy, but evoke the spirit and mood I'm shooting for in this adventure. Obviously, I gave this artist's better known character creations a higher Number, and the words may or may not have much at all to do with the character depicted on the card."

"event","&nbsp;For Father's Day, my family got me the book &quot;Ironman, the Ultimate Guide to the Armored Superhero.&quot; They know me so well! In looking it over, I've made three observations:

1. &nbsp;I'm thinking I should be following what Matt Fraction writes more closely. After reading his Foreward in the book, I was struck by how similar some of our brainwaves must be (he even writes about the theme song from the '60s &quot;animated&quot; television show). I think Fraction &quot;gets&quot; Ironman (his conclusion that Ironman is one of the few superheroes whose alter ego--Tony Stark--is as much, if not more, fun being up front and center stage is spot on). After checking out his work on Casanova, I think Fraction also &quot;gets&quot; '60s superspies as well (it's not about Jack Bauer capping some guy's kneecaps down at the 7/11, although Fraction certainly does like to throw in a bunch of tangential and just plain weird stuff). I might have to check out some of his current Ironman comics, as well as the Mighty Thor (which will be a challenge for me, since I've never been a big fan of the blonde haired Norse wonder).

2. Ironman has become the center of the Marvel Universe. I used to think it was Spiderman, and I supposed a strong argument could still be made for him. Still, it seems like Spidey is often on the fringes of so many of Marvel's big storylines, while Ironman is right smack dab in the middle of them (even the whole House of M thing, which surprised me as I was reading the book).

3. Marvel's character bullpen is so much deeper and wider than DC's that it's scary. I know these are fighting words, but after Batman, I have a hard time caring much about any other DC character (although I can appreciate Superman's significance). Then you move on to what? Green Lantern? Wonder Woman? Flash? Green Arrow? (Okay, I like Flash when he's not being comedic relief.) I'm saddened to say this because I was a big DC fan during &quot;Crisis,&quot; but returned to Marvel shortly afterwards when not a lot seemed to be happening in DC-land (and moved on from there when &quot;way too much to comprehend&quot; seemed to be happening in the Marvel-verse). All in all, I can easily be interested in about&nbsp;10 different major Marvel superheroes (Ironman, Spiderman, Wolverine, Hulk, Captain America, the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Silver Surfer, Punisher, Thor, and I can even get intrigued by some minor ones too, Moon Knight anyone?)."

"event","&nbsp;I was hunting through the DVD section of my warehouse sales the other day after I noticed one member had purchased the movie &quot;Sideways&quot; for only $4.99. One of my coworkers is always talking about this movie (which is apparently wine related so comes up fairly frequently when working in the liquor department) and I thought I should check it out at some point.

In true warehouse sales fashion, I couldn't find &quot;Sideways&quot; anywhere, but I did find and buy the complete collection of four Matt Helm movies for only $12.99. These are campy spy parodies from the '60s starring Dean Martin. I've watched three of them now (&quot;The Silencers&quot;, &quot;Murderer's Row&quot;, and &quot;The Ambushers&quot;). I think they're almost better now than they were back in the '60s, as they have a lot of '60s panache (Mike Myers owes these movies a significant royalty for all the stuff that he stole in Austin Powers). 

Helm has three signature moves that have turned up in every movie so far. He drinks a lot (often while driving), he strips the clothes off from women (sometimes accidentally, sometimes not), and he's always armed with at least one quirky gun (i.e. fires backwards, freezes target, takes ten seconds before going off, fires an anti-gravity beam). What's not fun about that?

I was almost thrown for a loop when I saw the Producer of these movies was Irving Allen. I thought &quot;Is this the guy that did 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea', 'Lost In Space', 'Land of the Giants', and 'Time Tunnel'?&quot; Nope, as it turns out, that was actually Irwin Allen (no relation apparently).

Also, I saw &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; on its opening weekend. It was fantastic, 'nuff said!&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;I thought I would drop by the GenCon website to see how my events were faring. Here's how they look so far as pre-registration is concerned:<br /><br /><strong>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</strong>--8 tickets sold, no tickets left (this event selling out is not a big surprise given the provocative name and the extensive fan base that has been building at GenCon for about five years now);<br /><br /><strong>Submariners</strong>--4 tickets sold, 4 left (this event also seems to be gaining some traction with some of the regular GenCon attendees);<br /><br /><strong>Racing Spies</strong>--2 tickets sold, 6 left (this event has always been problematic and I'm not sure why);<br /><br /><strong>Jawgrinder</strong>--no tickets sold, 8 left (this surprises me somewhat, since it seems GenCon attendees almost like superheroes better than fantasy adventurers, still it might be the obscure title causing problems).<br /><br />I'm pretty happy that 14 people have laid down money so far to be in my events. The flip side of the coin is that pre-registration has almost nothing to do with who actually shows up to your event. It almost seems that getting sold out early is a bad thing, as that may mean some large group has decided to give your event a shot, but will collectively stand you up once they discover other stuff going on during the convention.<br /><br />It's about time I get cranking on preparing my events."

"event","I've been keeping busy lately, both in checking out DVDs and reading books.<br /><br />I finally got around to watching Heroes Season 2. I've had it for a while, but the rumors were it was pretty bad, so I wasn't inspired to check it out until I got Heroes Season 3 for Christmas. The good news is that I don't think Season 2 was all that bad, and there were actually parts of it that I thought were fairly inspired. The bad news was that I thought the first half of Season 3 (&quot;Villains&quot;) was pretty awful. Still, it picked up very nicely during the second half of the season (&quot;Fugitives&quot;). There are definitely times when I feel that Heroes writers just throw stuff in with no real purpose in mind (like the Eclipse and the B&amp;W scenes from '61).<br /><br />For reading material, I've been collecting more of the Alex Rider teen series. They read super fast and the writer is pretty good at action pacing. I have also been working through <strong>Pirates </strong>by Ted Bell, another novel which is supposed to have a James Bond-y feel to it. It's decent enough, although the author has some kind of grudge against the French (the big villain is France, seriously?) and gets little details wrong (China has the world's largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, since when?). He also has a character that is so much of a caricature (of a big, scary black man) that it's almost uncomfortably racist (although the attempt is meant to be actually heroic and positive).<br /><br />For comic books, I just picked up the <em>Cable and the New Mutants </em>collection, which should hopefully get me properly in the Rob Liefeld mindset just in time for my &quot;Jawgrinder&quot; event at GenCon in August.<br /><br />There's also stuff I've been reading for school, but that's pretty dry and boring and best left undetailed."

There's not too much in plotting, since I'm basically ripping off one of the major plots in my introductory adventure. It involves a war between vampires and werewolves, but in true '60s ultraspy fashion, neither side may or may not be really supernatural. <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""More stuff"">The toughest thing for me was trying to decide the opening &quot;hook&quot; scene. I had two good ideas. On the one hand, I thought of a scene where the agents were checking out Hyde Park in central London on a moonlight night, only to be attacked by wolves. The other involved them discovering someone who had been attacked and killed in a vampire-type manner&nbsp;at the London port. In the end, I decided the vampire angle left more investigation possibilities. It should be a good scenario. My Sex, Lies and Ultraspies events at Con of the North have always gone off pretty well (even if Con of the North goers have a tendency to really ramp up their super powers).<br /><br />One nifty thing I've done is create characters sheets for Sex, Lies and Ultraspies. I've been nursing my poor old computer along for about a year now (with all of 250 mghz of RAM, yippee), but I've discovered some pretty nifty things can be done just with Microsoft Picture It Easy.<br /><br />Here's&nbsp;an example of the sheets:<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ruckusmanager/pic/00006gyp/""><img border=""0"" style=""width: 209px; height: 273px"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/ruckusmanager/pic/00006gyp/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />&nbsp;It pleases me to no end that the font featured at the top is called &quot;Original Avengers&quot;.

"event","Well, my obsession with James Bond is going into overdrive lately. I just picked up a Sean Connery DVD boxed set, which included ""A Bridge Too Far"", ""Cuba"", and ""Never Say Never Again"" (the ""unofficial"" James Bond movie which was NOT produced by Cubby Broccoli and allowed for strange copyright reasons involving the movie ""Thunderball""). Considering I only paid $9.99 for all three (which I would have gladly paid for just ""Never Say Never Again""), I think I got a bargain, although I've never seen ""Cuba"". 

I watched it this afternoon, and I must admit, it's probably in my top 3 Bond movies of all time. It has a decent villain and great underwater scenes. Where it really scores (literally) is with its Bond babes. Kim Bassinger does a very nice job as the love interest. Barbara Carrera also does excellent work as ajaxtalbot's favorite femme fatale. It only really struggles in the music department (I've even revised my previous opinion of the scene where Bond squares off against the villain in a videogame--it's really not as bad as it sounds).

One of these days, I'm going to have to watch and rate all of the Bond movies."

"event","Per threatening orders from that most demanding of Knomemasters, ajaxtalbot, I came up with my game plan for next year's conventions over this past weekend (the preregistration deadline for GenCon is probably closer than I imagine). 

Of course, I will continue the triple threat of <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies </em>(Ministry Q, Submariners, and Racing Spies). Ministry Q will get a double dose of love, both at Con of the North in February and later at GenCon in August (with different adventures no less). I have some solid ideas (Ministry Q at CotN will feature the Vampires vs. Werewolves portion pulled out of the &quot;Hard Week's Night&quot; adventure, Submariners at GenCon will borrow heavily from the published adventure &quot;Operation: Atlantis&quot; for <em>DC Heroes</em>), some hazy ideas (Ministry Q at GenCon will riff off from the &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot; episode of <em>I Spy</em>), and some fantastically vague ideas (Racing Spies will take place in the American Southwest, should have some type of shootout at the OK Corral situation, and Motorcyle Apaches).

That leaves me one last event to run at GenCon. After serious deliberation, I've decided to make it a superhero game (generally well attended) that takes every really bad trope from the so-called &quot;Iron Age&quot; of comics. Of course, it will have to be illustrated by Rob Liefeld, feature corrupt politicians, anti-heroes on the run, gratuitous violence, and involve enough time travel to make your brain hurt. I'm even planning on letting the players design their own characters within certain guidelines. I'm going to hand out five small cards with illustrations of various Iron Age characters (every one created by the master himself) which will not only have an appropriate number (none of that complicated &quot;divide in half and add six&quot; math that confuses so many!) but also keywords related to that character (easily usable as Jobs or Gimmicks). Players will be awarded Yum Yums based on how well they design a character according to the Iron Age tropes (and combining the elements of their character cards). I'm calling this masterpiece &quot;Jawgrinder&quot;.
 
In case you don't remember, I wasn't very pleased with the way many of my games went off last year. Some of it may have been the players, but I think a lot of it was what I was bringing to the table as a gamemaster. This year, I'm going to be more prepared and practiced than ever. Which means I'm going to make sure every event is playtested. This might involve kidnapping my friends at gunpoint to role play. Stay tuned!"

"event","I recently finished the next in the ""Union Trilogy"" of James Bond novels by Raymond Benson. It was called ""Doubleshot"" and had a fairly standard doppelganger plot. You know, the one where the secret agent has an exact double about to commit some nefarious deed, only to be replaced by the actual secret agent who tricks the bad guys into thinking he or she is the double.

It's really standard fare in the spy genre, particularly on television shows. I can probably think of at least a half dozen variations of this theme covered in the Avengers, for example. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work in novel form (although I must admit ""Point Blank"" in the teen spy Alex Rider series was a variation on the ""replacing important people with obedient doppelgangers"" plot that didn't suck). Unfortunately, Benson writes next to nothing about the action surrounding the doppelganger, choosing to focus on Bond stumbling around from one plot point to the next. 

After suffering through this novel, I felt compelled to watch the Avengers' episode ""They Keep Killing Steed"" (One of the better Tara King efforts). One of the reasons doppelganger plots work so much better on television is that you actually see that the doppelganger looks just like his or her victim (because they are played by the same actor). If it's an actor as talented as Patrick Macnee, you can also tell by his basic mannerisms that, even though the doppelganger looks just like the main character, he is not actually John Steed. No wonder they kept going back to this plotline again and again.

I did have to laugh because the back cover promo for ""Doubleshot"" said that this adventure would take Bond to the ""seedy"" side of Soho. Basically, it meant that Bond visited an adult bookstore."

"event","I bought the Hero System books last week. Even though it wasn't my first (that would actually be Top Secret, followed by Traveller and AD&D) this was the first role playing game I really fell for in a major way back in the day. Back when I first picked it up, it was 90 pages long. Now, it's not just one huge book, but two. It's amazing how much it's bloated over the years, and I think Hero System fans really like it that way.

I mostly bought the 6th edition for nostalgia purposes. I own every edition except the first (which I'm convinced is just a few dozen mimeographed copies lying in a few select people's collections). I doubt I will ever run it again, although I certainly wouldn't be opposed in joining a group that played it.

I will say that in looking through the new books, there's something comforting in seeing that not really all that much has changed. If you knew the second edition, you could adapt to the 6th edition pretty quickly.

It's even taken some cues from QAGS (Hero Action Points = Yum Yums)."

"event","I've been working and reading quite a bit lately, but writing not so much (particularly to my livejournal).<br /><br />The fall semester is well underway. I'm taking one class (Teaching Literacy in the Elementary School) and that will be it until I begin student teaching in the spring. This class has a clinical component to it, meaning I'm going to an elementary school one morning a week to help out with their reading program for kindergartners through 3rd grade. It's been very inspirational for me, because it's been something of a worst case scenario so far. The classes are absolute chaos (one teacher has either left or was fired during the four weeks I've been there), and I decided to pick the one that seemed to be the worst (I'm always working on the learning edge, doncha know). So what's my inspiration? Knowing that I should be able to do a better job (or at least no worse) than any of these&nbsp;people! Next week, we start presenting our own lessons, and I'm really thinking about trying to do it in front of the entire class (leading edge, remember?) rather than small groups.<br /><br />I've made an effort to really ramp up my reading this year. One of the things my literacy class has taught me is how much of&nbsp;the reading I've done the&nbsp;last ten years or so has been about <em>efference</em>, basically reading to acquire information, rather than <em>aesthetics</em>, which is reading for pleasure.&nbsp;Prior to this&nbsp;year, I mostly read game books, some non-fiction, text books and other material in an effort to acquire information.<br /><br />So in that vein, here's what I've read lately. I finished <em>Point Blank </em>by Anthony Horowitz, the&nbsp;second in the Alex Rider teen spy series. It was pretty decent, even if it borrowed heavily from Ian Fleming's <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em>. It even had a cloning plot which didn't require too much suspension of belief for me. For my birthday, my oldest daughter gave me the third and the fourth in the series (she definitely&nbsp;has ulterior motives in&nbsp;that she like to read them too).&nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking of Fleming, I finished <em>Moonraker</em>,&nbsp;his third James Bond book.&nbsp;You can tell Fleming is struggling to come up with ideas, as for the second time in three books, he&nbsp;has James subdued&nbsp;via automobile accident. Bond gets first involved in the plot by tricking a card cheat (which will come up again in <em>Goldfinger</em>). He also really goes into the mastermind monologue this time. Obviously the book has absolutely nothing to do with that glorious action/near parody produced in the '70s with space shuttles and laser beams and Jaws.<br /><br />In keeping with the spy theme, I've also been reading the so-called &quot;Union Trilogy&quot; for James Bond by Raymond Benson. I've never read any of Benson's take on Bond, as I had already given up on John Gardner's take on the superspy after&nbsp;he had a fairly&nbsp;decent restart to the series, but quickly devolved into stupidity. I figured Benson has two major points against him in writing Bond. 1. He's an American. 2. He's a gamer (he even wrote a supplement for the 007 RPG).<br /><br />As it turns out, my prejudices were on target. I've finished the first in the trilogy, <em>High Time To Kill</em>. The set up of climbing Mt. Everest (actually one of its sister mountains) in a race to retrieve a macguffin sounded promising. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on many different levels. Benson throws in so many product placements you begin to wonder if he's getting sponsored to do it. Then, not just once, but twice his James Bond decides to take a break to have sex even while the mission hangs in the balance. I mean, you almost thought Gardner's Bond was going to settle down and have some kids, but this was unforgivably in the opposite direction.<br /><br />As for my own writing, I'm working on creating a believable &quot;evil&quot; conspiracy for <em>Racing Spies</em>. Actually, they aren't all that evil, just motivated in a particularly negative direction. If only I were more motivated to write about them in any direction."

"event","I'd like to take yet another episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; and &quot;Ultraspy&quot; it. This one was called &quot;Father Abraham&quot;, and was about a young physicist who decides to sacrifice himself to feed the commies bad information and interfere with their solid rocket fuel program. Our two intrepid heroes, Kelly and Alexander, are directed to break him down, basically interrogate him until he spills the beans in a convincing enough manner. <br /><br />They then escort him around Rome, with the backstory that he is a brilliant, but embittered and alcoholic American physicist responsible for a breakthrough in solid rocket fuel, hoping the enemy will&nbsp;take the bait. Unfortunately, the young physicist's father, a powerful and influential general, gets word of his son's shenanigans and confronts him about his unAmerican ways (he would rather see him dead than turn traitor, hence the &quot;Father Abraham&quot; title). <br /><br />Kelly and Alexander think the whole thing has been blown, but the confrontation between father and son is just the sign the commies are looking for that the situation is for real, and they kidnap the guy (it's amazing how many one punch knockouts they have in this series!) for interrogation. To further complicate matters, Daddy comes to the rescue before the physicist can give away his &quot;information&quot;. Kelly and Alexander have to knock out the father and return the physicist to his captors, where he can finally spill and beans, and they can finally get back to rescue him (even from his own father, who witnesses the &quot;betrayal&quot;). In the end, father is set straight, and the physicist is set to disappear, supposedly killed in the scuffle&nbsp;(but with a posthumous medal to make Dad proud).<br /><br />Obviously, between this episode and the one I detailed previously, some of the writers for &quot;I Spy&quot; had some real Daddy issues.<br /><br /><strong>The Ultraspy Version</strong><br />Take out the rocket fuel angle, and make it an Ironman-like&nbsp;battle suit!&nbsp;The young guy, who is a certifiable genius,&nbsp;has invented a great suit of battle armor. Unfortunately, only one has ever been created, and the government has spent millions of dollars trying to create others to no avail (some kind of psychic link between the guy and the suit). The guy, feeling guilty for all of the money he's wasted and useless because he can't create any others, comes up with this plan to derail the commies in their own battle armor program.<br /><br />Everything else can proceed pretty much along the same storyline, except the commies should be equipped with some high tech gear of their own, and Dad should definitely show up for his rescue in the battle suit, which could be subsequently claimed&nbsp;and used by the commies.&nbsp;"

"event","In addition to reading a lot during this brief break, I've also been watching some stuff I've had for a while on DVD. Mostly, I've been checking out &quot;I Spy&quot; seasons 2 and 3. It occurred to me that I could &quot;Ultraspyify&quot; most of these episodes to come up with some nifty adventure seeds for my &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot; roleplaying game.

One of my favorite episodes that I've seen so far is called &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot;. It stars Opie (a young Ron Howard) as a kid neglected by his rocket scientist father (played by Napoleon Solo, aka Robert Vaugn). Opie&nbsp;decides to get Dad's attention by stealing a miniature guidance system and running away from home. Our two intrepid agents, Bill Cosby and Robert Culp, are assigned to find the kid and the guidance system before the Russians (or at least some vaguely Eastern European types) do. Added into the mix is a sweet hearted secretary who is a little too sweet hearted for her fellow man (she bleeds pink, if you know what I mean, and is an obvious dupe for those swarthy Eastern European types). In the end, the hip cat agents find and befriend the boy at an amusement park, beat off the communists, and retrieve the guidance system. I do like how the episode avoids syruppy sap at the end (that would have been the '80s style) as father and son still seem to have some issues.

The Ultraspy version should have the kid possess &quot;special&quot; powers, and I'm thinking teleportation (a la I Dream Of Jeannie) might be fun. Keep the kid hanging out at an amusement park, but add in some Paladin-types from the movie Jumpers looking to eliminate one of their own who has gone bad. Also,&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;give the commies some &quot;special&quot; powers of their own (I'm thinking at least a wolverine-type sniffer/tracker combat monster type). Change the setting from Malibu to the Brighton Resort area in southwest England and most of the rest of the story would be good. The only thing that doesn't ring very British is the &quot;Poor me, my father ignores me&quot; vibe. I suspect most upper class British children would actually expect that sort of treatment. It could easily be altered with a &quot;I'm special, but Daddy doesn't&nbsp;want me to show it. I'll show him by taking away what make him special&quot; vibe, particularly&nbsp;given the kid's powers.

Voila, an ultrapyified adventure awaits!&nbsp;"

"event","Since I'm finished with my summer classes and have yet to begin my Fall class, I've had some time to read, and I've actually made the most of it. Here's what I've gotten through so far:<br /><br /><strong>The Gunseller </strong>by <em>Hugh Laurie</em>: Early on in reading this book, I was really hating Laurie for not only being a talented actor, but a talented writer as well. Fortunately, the story, which was about a secret agent-type named Thomas Lang who becomes involved in a terrorist plot designed to increase weapon sales, falters a little in the middle (so Laurie does have some faults to my mind) but concludes very nicely indeed. The protagonist, a capable and dangerous smartass, is my absolute favorite archetype.<br /><br /><strong>On Writing </strong>by <em>Stephen King</em>: After running across this as a strong recommendation for the second time in as many months (the first was by Kelly Gallagher, a teacher/writer whom I greatly respect, the second was from cybersluagh), I decided to pick this up and check it out. I'm not really sure about the advice on writing (it strikes me mostly as a &quot;this is what works for me&quot; manual) but the autobiographical incidents from King's own life are priceless. It did make me realize that I don't want to be a novelist at this point in my life, even though I (like King) have vivid memories of the first novel I read where I thought &quot;I can do better than this.&quot; It was <strong>Sahara </strong>by <em>Clive Cussler</em>. I probably read a few other stinkers&nbsp;before then, but no one makes as much money off from his or her crap as Cussler.<br /><br /><strong>Stormbreaker </strong>by <em>Anthony Horowitz</em>: Speaking of crap (just kidding, sort of), I picked up a couple of the early Alex Rider series about a teenage spy. I read <strong>Ark Angel</strong>, a later novel in this series, for my literature methods class, and found it light and fun reading. <strong>Stormbreaker&nbsp;</strong>is the first in the series, and it was quite a bit rougher (which is actually nice to see Mr. Horowitz has improved in his craft).<br /><br /><strong>Destroyer #55, Master's Challenge</strong> by <em>Warren Murphy </em>and <em>Richard Sapir</em>: During my adolescence, I read more Destroyer novels than I should admit to, and I couldn't resist picking one up when I found myself at a used bookstore during vacation. It was actually as much fun as I remember them--kind of like Alex Rider but with more sex, drugs and rock and roll (to think I was reading them at the exact same age all of these &quot;teen&quot; novels are geared toward. Bah, in my day, we didn't have no stinking &quot;teen&quot; section in the book store!).<br /><br /><strong>Damnation Decade </strong>by <em>Robert Toth</em>: This is one of the few roleplaying products (minus all of the quality Hex Games stuff, of course) I picked up during GenCon (for D20 Modern, no less). It does a pretty good job of interweaving many of the classic '70s movies into quite the hodgepodge setting. I really like the overall &quot;In Search Of..&quot; motif (I have to see if that series is on DVD, I am such a child of the '70s!), but I dislike the author changing the name of literally everything (people, countries, oceans, etc.) in this setting.<br /><br />It's nice to see that my reading habits have picked up quite a bit during this break. I'm ashamed to say they've really slacked off quite a bit for the last ten or so years."

Today, we went to the local Renaissance Faire. As I wandered alongside the costumed &quot;performers&quot;, trinket shops, and people chomping on turkey legs, I pondered the intricacies of the various levels of geekdom. I wondered why I was completely comfortable telling my coworkers that I was going to the Renaissance Faire (and they were completely comfortable accepting this fact) while I&nbsp;dare not ever mention going to the GenCon Roleplaying Game Convention (for fear of the uncomfortable attempts at explanation and the silences that follow). 

When did it become more socially acceptable to actually dress up strangely and waltz around&nbsp;some constructed fantasy of a medieval village than to simply pretend that you're doing almost the same thing by rolling some dice? 

Maybe the RenFaire types have better PR people than gamers."

"event","I've had a week to ponder the events of GenCon, so here goes.

I ran six events this year. I had a total of 29 players for an average of 4.83 players per event. Not bad, especially considering my Sindbad event didn't go off at all (0 players) and my Spy Racers game only had 2. They were both on Saturday, generally the busiest day of the convention, which was especially discouraging. Spy Racers also proved that an event which fills up in preregistration&nbsp;can be&nbsp;particularly problematic, as it's likely that a large group signed up together and may have found something better to do.

My general impression is that the 3 hour format I tried out this year didn't work all that well for me. I had two events go right up to the&nbsp;three hour mark (which in turn caused problems for the next GM at the table) and the rest all went less (some almost criminally so). It was very difficult for me to gauge pacing, as I'm much more comfortable with 4 hours. Most importantly, the 3 hour event did nothing to attract more gamers to my event. I had thought the busy gamers of GenCon might give a 3 hour event more of a try, but GenCon forces you to charge the same amount as a 4 hour event, so that really didn't happen.

So next year, I'm going to only run 4 hour events. I'm going to stay away from Saturday, which means I'll be running four events. Gone will be Qerth (which actually had a fairly decent conclusion), Sindbad (which unfortunately did not, but the only reason I wanted to run it this year was because of how awesome it was last year), and Rocket Jocks (which is a game I've discovered is very hard to keep from turning into purely ridiculous camp).

Set in stone will be three Sex,&nbsp;Lies and Ultraspies games: Ministry Q (which went off almost perfectly this year, except for that one &quot;problematic&quot; player who dwells a bit too much on a tiresome theme, Submariners (ditto, except different tiresome theme), and Racing Spies (my new name for Spy Racers).

I need at least one more female character for Submariners (we ran short during this session). The second lieutenant role wasn't taken (and he tends to be awfully similar to the grizzled veteran role) so I thought about changing the genders up. I just needed to find an actress from the '60s in scuba gear. I tried Zale Perry from Sea Hunt (Lloyd Bridges was currently filling the role), but I couldn't find any decent photos of her in scuba gear (or at all actually). So, it's going to be Claudine Auger from Thunderball.

For my final event, I'd really like to try something reasonably &quot;serious&quot;. I'm thinking about a &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; type adventure with &quot;Ultramercs&quot;, i.e. mercenaries in the '60s with limited paranormal abilities. I'll have to think about it a little more, but I do have at least a year to ponder it."

In setting up 18 different character sheets, I find myself somewhat melancholy (and not just from writer's cramp). As much as I'd love to see my Diviner, Pythia Ouija, or troubadour, Madonna Baldwin, selected by a ready, willing and able roleplayer this year, sadly it's probably not going to happen.

I predict that the Rabbi and Godi characters will definitely be played. If there is a female roleplayer at the event (there always has been), she will pick the Elf. In the end, the Rabbi player will be selected as the best roleplayer.

In case you don't remember what happened in the last two years, you can check out my update handout for the players: <br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Lengthy Background Text""><strong>Qerth: Labyrinth&rsquo;s End </strong><br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>: This is the third and final Qerth adventure of the &ldquo;Velveeta Underground&rdquo; trilogy being hosted at Gencon. This may mean your characters are about to embark on a grand epic tale of amazing exploits and armed robbery, possibly like <em>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em>, but they might also have to fight alongside cute teddy bear creatures for the kids in the audience, like in <em>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</em>. <br /><br />In the last two adventures, our heroes went on a quest in order to defend the poor city of Oftenraidedberg in the country of Regalia on the world of Qerth from an approaching goblin horde. Of course, this expedition involved plenty of armed robbery and murder. <br /><br />First, the characters broke into the Last Bastion of the Brujahaha. They killed (maybe permanently this time, maybe not?) the undead freaky Chinese hopping vampire known as Baron Bobby and took his stuff, which included a powerful weapon known as the Cheese Grater of the Apocalypse. The heroes hoped to use this weapon to destroy the powerful Goblin King and send his forces into chaos and retreat. <br /><br />Unfortunately, our hardy band of fantasy adventurers discovered that the goblins were not actually responsible for the horde approaching Oftenraidedberg. Instead, a powerful Magic Man known as Billy Bonka and goblin-like creatures known as Umpalumpas had kidnapped the Goblin King and were conquering their way toward the beleaguered city. <br /><br />Luckily, our fortune-hunters broke into Billy Bonka&rsquo;s Cheese Factory and managed to free the Goblin King and use the Cheese Grater of the Apocalypse to kill the Magic Man and take his stuff. <br /><br />Throughout these adventures, the heroes were plagued by Neo-Cheesites, misguided cultists of the Church of Velveeta Eaters, who had allied themselves with Billy Bonka in an attempt to gain control of all of Regalia. <br /><br />To top it all off, the adventurers didn&rsquo;t actually need the Cheese Grater of the Apocalypse (although it certainly didn&rsquo;t hurt in their efforts at murder) and have had several nasty run ins lately with Queso Demons, who seem to be attracted to its powerful and naughty presence. All attempts to rid themselves of the cursed artifact have failed. <br /><br />Still, life is pretty good. The characters have been welcomed back to Oftenraidedberg as true heroes. Our story picks up at a citywide celebration, featuring a potluck and hanging (of the remaining Neo-Cheesites), in the adventurers&rsquo; honor&hellip;</lj-cut>"

"event","<p>I picked up the <em><strong>Lucha Libre Hero </strong></em>supplement for Hero Games the other day and have been looking it over. I was a little worried about&nbsp;this product. I have my own take on the &quot;Masked Professional Rasslin'&quot; genre wandering&nbsp;around in my head and was thinking about using it as&nbsp;a possible future supplement for &quot;Sex, Lies and Ultraspies&quot;. I know a ton of these inexpensive flicks were made in the '60s, and some of them even have to do with international ultraspying. I was hoping this book wouldn't already cover most of the ideas in my head.<br /><br />Luckily, not much of what I've read of <em><strong>Lucha Libre Hero </strong></em>coincides with my take on the genre. The book focuses a lot on the gonzo zaniness of the Luchadore genre, which is fair enough. In true Hero form, there's also literally hundreds of&nbsp;rasslin' maneuvers presented.<br /><br />What seems missing, oddly, (and what I'd really like to focus on) is the &quot;myth of the mask&quot;. Mexican rasslers probably started wearing masks as a simple and inexpensive way to increase the rasslin' personalities in a performance. Using a mask, one rassler&nbsp;could play several different roles. But&nbsp;I think it grew beyond that. The mask began to mean something&nbsp;more, in much the&nbsp;same way it does in the superhero genre. That's what I'd like to focus on.<br /><br />Anyhow, that's all way down the&nbsp;line for me. First up&nbsp;is hammering out my GenCon events. I've looked over&nbsp;last year's&nbsp;folders. Some of the handouts need a little updating, but everything seems to be in good shape.&nbsp;</p>"

"event","I picked up a copy of the <em>Wild Talents </em>Role-playing Game a couple of weeks ago. It's the essential edition, so it was only 10 bucks and pretty hard to pass up (not that I've passed up many super-hero role-playing games in the past).<br /><br />For those who don't know, <em>Wild Talents </em>has a pretty funky die rolling mechanic. Its a dice pool system, meaning your stat plus your skill tells you how many dice you will be rolling.&nbsp;As long as two of your dice results match, you've succeeded. That's fairly straightforward, but the funky thing for <em>Wild Talents </em>is&nbsp;the number of matches tells you how fast you succeeded, while the number matched tells you how well you&nbsp;succeeded. There's some other added stuff to the dice rolling, but that's the basics.<br /><br />I'm not sure I completely like the system, since it implies that the more skilled you are in an area, the faster you can get things done (not necessarily the higher quality work you can produce, which is mostly just a random number). It also uses 10 sided dice, which makes&nbsp;my inner mathematician&nbsp;cringe (they're not even symmetrical polyhedrons!).<br /><br />Another thing I didn't&nbsp;like was the combat example in the book, which had a scuffle between two supposed teammates (in a bar, no less) devolve into near-death for one of them. The example also only detailed the player's rolls, with the gamemaster apparently rolling behind a screen and simply telling the results. I guess I've been rolling in front of my players and&nbsp;fairly applying the results for so long now that this just felt completely wrong.<br /><br />I really like examples in a role-playing game book, however. So much so, I've been working on a fairly&nbsp;extensive one for the Vehicle Chase Rules in <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em>&nbsp;(involving 8 vehicles, no less!)."

"event","After having read the original novel, I bought and watched the &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; James Bond DVD the other week. Of course I've already seen it multiple times, but it brought back fond memories of how much fun Bond movies used to be.

Ever the contrarian, I've decided that Sir Roger Moore has been the best James Bond so far. Most people put him at the bottom of their list. Obviously, it helps that he was the James Bond I grew up with in the '70s and early '80s, but there's certainly other reasons I can make this claim as well.

He made the most &quot;official&quot; Bond movies, clocking in at 7 (which actually ties Sir Sean Connery if you count that unofficial &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;). Through his run, he dutifully played the role, never complaining, quitting, coming back again, quitting again, making an unofficial one, etc.&nbsp;He even strongly suggested that he was getting a little long in the tooth for the last couple (&quot;Octopussy&quot; and &quot;A View To A Kill&quot;) that they wanted him to do. All of his movies were considered highly successful at the box office.

Most of all,&nbsp;he seems to have known exactly what&nbsp;his Bond was all about--and that is pure fantasy escapism. &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, his first Bond movie, is a perfect example of this. Although dealing with potentially controversial issues (drugs and race), you never get the feeling that this movie is taking itself very seriously. I had almost completely forgotten about the southern sheriff stereotype found in this film (one of the earliest incarnation of the many which would follow). The boat chase scenes are now the stuff of legend (they actually unintentionally set a Guinness World Record with one of their boat jumps).

Because of their focus on fantasy escapism, Moore's Bond movies are still entertaining even at their worst (&quot;A View To A Kill&quot;). It's hard to say the same about some of the others which tried to take a more serious approach to serious issues (Timothy Dalton's &quot;License To Kill&quot; which also dealt with drugs, and Pierce Brosnan's &quot;Die Another Day&quot; which dealt with North Korea)."

"event","I bought the <em>Youngblood </em>hardcover last weekend. I think I've already explained my unnatural attraction to the comic book &quot;art&quot; of Rob Liefeld. It's so over-the-top I can't help but stare at&nbsp;it--sort of like&nbsp;an automobile accident.<br /><br />I&nbsp;can remember buying Youngblood #1 back when it came out (didn't everybody?) but quickly gave up on it when the second issue seemed to never materialize in true Image and Liefeld style. Anyhow, this hardcover appears to be a compilation of the first five issues, spiffied up with new coloring and even new dialogue that actually makes a little sense.<br /><br />The best parts of this book are an opening commentary by Mark Millar and some concept artwork Liefeld did way back in the day which featured Youngblood characters. Millar's piece is a&nbsp;delightful bit of wankery which not only gives Liefeld credit for every popular comic book title that has been released since, but actually compares him to Jack Kirby!!! The concept art is very interesting because it proves that, at one point,&nbsp;Liefeld could actually draw people fairly normally.<br /><br />Fantastic stuff!<br />"

"event","One of the amazing things about the Twin Cities is how many bike paths that can be found crisscrossing throughout them. Unfortunately, there's very few decent maps detailing these, so you start to feel a little like Lewis and Clark blazing a trail to discover the routes that link them up. 

Over last weekend, I finally discovered the last segment of bike paths linking my house and my work (about 21 miles away). For the Monday Holiday, I decided to put myself to the test and ride there and back. The trip was truly epic, taking me through several parks, up and down thigh burning hills, and in view of one of the greatest sites in the entire Twin Cities, which is on a bridge where you can clearly see the downtown skyscrapers&nbsp;of both St. Paul and Minneapolis.

While I was in the vicinity of my work, I also decided to try out an Indian restaurant which always gets rave reviews, particularly for its lunch buffet. Its owner occassionally comes into the store and seems like a very nice guy. 

I've always thought I didn't like Indian cuisine very much. I'm not a huge fan of curry and haven't particularly enjoyed what I've had. Well, it turns out that the Indian food I've tried in the past was crap. The buffet was spectacular (working up an appetite during a 20 mile bike ride probably didn't hurt)&nbsp;with about eight different vegetarian entrees alone.

All in all, it beat the heck out of the traditional Memorial Day barbecue and beer."

Although I thought they were pretty fun, admittedly neither one of them has much to do with '60s Ultraspies. So I decided to remove them. In order that they not completely go to waste, here they are:<br /><br /><p><b>The Bluesmobile</b><br />The Bluesmobile is a <a>1974</a> Dodge Monaco sedan equipped with &ldquo;a cop motor, a 440-cubic-inch V-8 plant, cop tires, cop suspension, cop shocks, and made before catalytic converters so it runs good on regular gas.&rdquo; Because it is on a mission from God, it can roll its Gimmick to avoid taking any damage and escape from perilous situations.</p><p><b>Body:</b> 18<br /><b>Brain:</b> 6<br /><b>Nerve:</b> 15<br /><b>Size:</b> 3<br /><b>Maneuver:</b> +3<br /><b>Redline:</b> +3<br /><b>Gimmick:</b> On a Mission from God (18)<br /><b>Weakness:</b> Wanted by Authorities (18)<br /><b>AR:</b> 3<br /><b>HP:</b> 72<br /><b>YY:</b> 5<br /><b>Total Cost:</b> 90<br /><br /><b>Happy Toyz Goblin Truck</b><br />A <a>1977</a> White Western Truck with an eerie green goblin face mounted to its front, this scary truck has turned sentient after being doused with strange radiation from a passing comet.

"event","<p>I went to go see <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </em>yesterday. I have to say I was pretty disappointed in it. I was a huge fan of the three X-Men movies, but I dislike the current direction . <br /><br />First off, making it a prequel is so Lucas-like (as in stupid). We know Wolverine is going to&nbsp;survive the movie. We know&nbsp;Sabretooth is going to survive the movie (but somehow be really tight-lipped about being&nbsp;Wolverine's&nbsp;brother in the first X-Men movie). Hell,&nbsp;by the&nbsp;end I even felt the guy who had his head cut off is probably going to survive somehow (Oh wait, I didn't even wait to see the scene after the credits to prove this).<br /><br />Secondly, I think Hugh Jackman has outgrown this role. Don't get me wrong, he was incredible in the original trilogy. In this movie though,&nbsp;I had&nbsp;a hard time believing he's such a badass guy. This&nbsp;would probably be okay&nbsp;if the action occurred after the original trilogy, because&nbsp;the character of Wolverine should be somewhat changed and redeemed after those events. Previous to those events, he should have been even more badass, but he actually seemed tamer in this prequel.<br /><br />Finally, the new actor playing Stryker was nowhere near as subtly menacing as the guy who did it in X-Men 2. I never got the same self-righteous &quot;Mutants should be controlled or eliminated&quot; vibe from this guy, who mostly spent the entire movie with a smarmy &quot;I am evil&quot; look on his face.</p><p>It was disappointing on so many levels. This is not a good way to start the summer movie season.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

Oh well, I might as well start May off right with a quick update post.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago, I got back another round of editing&nbsp;for <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em>. I started to work my way&nbsp;through it, but I found my schoolwork interfered with getting much done.&nbsp;The good news is that&nbsp;I only have about a week and a half left of school, and most of the major projects have been completed. Also, this round of editing was done by the &quot;crunch&quot; guy for the QAGS system (if there really&nbsp;could even be&nbsp;such a person), and most&nbsp;of&nbsp;the &quot;crunchy&quot; parts (i.e. rule expansions), while needing some major revisions, at least didn't completely crash and burn with him.<br /><br />School has gone well&nbsp;this&nbsp;semester. I am now less than a year away from student teaching. I recently took my initial round of Praxis test&nbsp;and did well on two of the three sections that were graded on sight (I'll need to wait a few weeks to find out about the other one). I also found out that the instructor for one of my summer classes wants to try and cram it into half of the time. This means I'll be done in plenty of time to go to GenCon.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I should start working on my GenCon adventures (right after I'm through with <em>Sex, Lies and Ultraspies</em>). Checking out online registration, I see that Spy Racers has sold out, Rocket Jocks only has one ticket left, Qerth has four remaining, Ministry Q has six left, Submariners has all but one, and poor Sindbad has all of its tickets just waiting to be snatched up.<br /><br />My philosophy this year is that even though my events are an hour shorter, participant will still get their month worth!</p>"

"event","<p>It seems that yet another &quot;industry expert&quot; is predicting the end of role-playing games. You can check out Allen Varney's article <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_193/5856-Internet-Killed-the-Tabletop-Star"">here</a>. <br /><br />It seems like every ten years or so, something new comes onto the scene that is going to kill off role-playing games forever. First, it was video games, then computer games, then collectible card games, now it's online computer games. I have no doubt role-playing games will survive now just as they did before.<br /><br />I think part of the current gloom and doom is last year's release of new edition of D&amp;D. It strikes me that this 4th edition has not been as universally accepted as the 3rd edition. I know there were plenty of people who rejected 3rd edition (hence the whole Hackmaster phenomona), but overall I thought it (especially thanks to the whole open gaming content) really propelled role-playing games into becoming more mainstream. I'll never forget when I actually went to a Barnes and Noble one Friday night after 3rd edition's release and found several groups of high school students playing D&amp;D there.<br /><br />I do feel there's a tendency to make newer editions of games more complicated (give them more &quot;crunch&quot; in the proper lingo).&nbsp;I've seen this happen to many of the games I enjoy. Champions has certainly changed edition to edition, although it still remains fairly true to its core (although rumors abound that may&nbsp;change with a new edition coming out soon). BESM added an incredible amount of detail from 1st to 2nd editions. Even QAGS has added some extras between its 1st and 2nd editions.&nbsp;<br /><br />There also tends to be a lot of people who like older rules editions better. I believe this is called the &quot;grognard&quot; effect, named after Napoleon's Old Guard &quot;grumblers&quot; always complaining about how much better things used to be &quot;in the old days&quot;.</p><p>Through it all, games continue to thrive. Everyone thought board and war games were on their way out when Avalon Hill was purchased by Hasbro and practically&nbsp;ceased&nbsp;to exist. They now seem stronger than ever. Give it another ten years, and everyone will still be talking about how role-playing games are dying, and grognards will be talking about how great things used to be now.<br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>In my ongoing quest to become master of all things '60s spies, I have decided that I need to collect and read all of the James Bond books (the ones by Ian Fleming at a minimum, I may waver slightly on the updated ones).<br /><br />During my misspent youth, I probably read over half of the Ian Fleming books. I can easily remember <em>Moonraker</em>, <em>Diamonds Are Forever</em>, <em>Dr. No</em>, <em>Goldfinger</em>, <em>For Your Eyes Only</em>, <em>Thunderball</em>, <em>You Only Live Twice</em>, and <em>The Man with the Golden Gun</em>. That's&nbsp;8 of the 14 right there. I'm a little hazy on <em>Live And Let Die</em>, <em>From Russia With Love</em>, and <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em>. I may or may not have read these, and unlike some of the previously mentioned novels, the movies are somewhat close to the books, so that's adding to my confusion as well. I'm absolutely positive I haven't read <em>Casino Royale</em>, <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em>, and <em>Octopussy and the Living Daylights</em>.<br /><br />So, I've purchase Fleming's first three Bond novels (man are paperbacks insanely priced nowadays or what?) and I've finished the first one <em>Casino Royal</em>, and I am now well into the second one, <em>Live and Let Die</em>. I have to admit I enjoy Fleming's style and I can see why he practically invented the fictional espionage genre. Even in <em>Casino Royale</em>, where he really seems to be struggling as a new writer, there's enough decent material to keep me interested. He really picked up the pace in what I've read of <em>Live and Let Die </em>so far, (although he suffers from that very British form of paternalistic racism).<br /><br />I also decided to check out the young Bond series. It's opening novel is called <em>Silverfin</em>, and I'm sorry to say that I thought it was pretty poor reading. There's absolutely nothing other than the Bond name to distinguish it from nearly any other young adult stuff. It's set in the '30s with a 13 year old Bond, which makes sense from an age perspective, but still loses a lot of the '60s feel that I'm looking for. Even worse, there's absolutely nothing distinguishing about&nbsp;this young James Bond&nbsp;other than the fact that he says &quot;I'm Bond, James Bond&quot; a lot.&nbsp;He somehow gets&nbsp;wrapped up in a bizarre genetic experiment (???) being conducted by an American (???) turned Scottish Lord (???). It's even worse when you're thinking like a language arts teacher and looking for things like characterization and themes. Unfortunately, it looks like there's at least four more sequels already out.</p>"

"event","I really haven't posted much this year, have I? Well, I might as well get in an obligatory update.

I started a new semester of classes last month. I've made it through all of my theory classes, and now the focus is on teaching topics. I'm taking four very short classes (health, music, physical education, and art) and one more lengthy class (language arts in middle and high school, which will give me my middle school teaching certification). 

All of the classes are going very well, particularly the language arts one. My instructor's educational philosophy closely matches my own (when she's not teaching us, she's teaching teachers for a school district in the suburbs).

One of the guilty pleasures that I've discovered about myself this semester is that I really enjoy making up lesson plans. I'm pretty sure this won't actually be very useful as a teacher, though.

The good news is that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel more and more. I've got two more classes this summer, one in the fall, and then it's on to student teaching is less than a year from now."

"event","I saw the Watchmen movie this afternoon. Overall, I thought it was&nbsp;really damn good (although the softcore pornno moments made&nbsp;me glad&nbsp;I didn't drag my wife to it). While mostly staying true to the series, they&nbsp;did alter the plot slightly, and I thought it actually made for a better story. The only really bad thing I can say about it is they added in a lot of fu action, which sort of ran counter to one of the series' themes of fighting violence with violence. Nite Owl is no longer the bumbling guy with the middle aged spread, he can really kick ass.

I'm not real sure how the movie is going to do overall, though. Granted it was in the middle of the afternoon, but the theater was basically full of males about my age. There may have been one or two women there. It certainly is not much of a date movie."

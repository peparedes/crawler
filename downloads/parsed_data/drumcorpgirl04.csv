"event","before i go into the events of the grants pass trip, ill revert back to my previous entry. when we were practicing on friday for marching band, krisitn said that she had been the one to tell mr prunk that kasey and i were making out in the stands...like she has room to talk, shes never there! but anyway, that pissed me off royaly, and even worse with kasey. that was really scary. i thought he was gonna hit something or kill her. but anyhow, i talked to mr prunk about it and he said we were not the problem at all, and that there was nothing to worry about with us, its the other people he was talking about. i asked him to tell kasey that, and he did, and for the most part, that helped. the day got alot better from then on. now, leading into the grants pass trip. after practice was over we got on the bus and ofcourse, i had to hurt myself within the first few minutes. my foot slipped and hit the metal footrest...owie pain! but anyhow, i sat next to kasey, of course, well, more laid on kasey, lol. we stopped in springfield for dinner, which was...not fun i guess due to sheer humilation at the cause of my sister! grrr on her! whatever. kasey wanted to buy me dinner, so he did, we had carls junior, which is always yummy. anyhow, we got back on the bus for another 3 hours, and i tried to sleep, and so did kasey, but that didnt work, lol. we got into grants pass at about 9pm and got to hang out until 11, which was bed. bed time kinda sucked cause no body really got any significant sleep. beds were loud, people wouldnt shutup, and it was hot, oh my gosh it was hot. i was asleep for the most part until about 6:45, 7ish when kasey woke me up. he was playing with my hair and it woke me up. it was nice to wake up with him by me, i dont know, it was just nice. he said he had been there for a while, but i didnt wake up until then. it was funny cause i moved or something and i opend my eyes partially and i thought i saw him laying by the head, but i just dismissed it thinking it was a dream or something like that, but it was real. he layed by me for a while until one of the old hags of moms told him to leave. after wake up and breakfast and all such like that, i met up with the guard for hair and makeup and all that great stuff, and of course, got reemed on by kristin for not being smart enough to have uniforms and flags not loaded on the truck and for not having the guard all have their own makeup and hair curlers. what a whore. kasey got sick on saturday, which wasnt good at all, but he got better after finals preformance. finals preformance kinda sucked for me, but whatever. so anyhow, i just realized how much im typing. so long story short, we got 5th out of 10, no caption awards, and a very cold color guard captain...grr on you mr prunk!!! on the bus ride home, i slept for a lot of it, i felt bad though cause kasey couldnt find a comfortable spot until like, an hour before we got home. mr prunk came back to find out who was sitting by who, and he told us to ""make smart choices"" lol, it was funny. slept for a while, and then both kasey and i were awake, but really tired. the bus makes it difficult to sleep i swear, lol. ga, i love it when he says he loves me. he said it a couple times last night and everytime it gives me butterflies. i think my heart honestly skips a beat. i swear, its like the josh grobin song. we got in at about 2 am, and my dad wont let me go home now, and ill i really wanna do is lay in my bed. oh well. i guess im done avoiding my homework now. love"

"event","ok, so im gonna make this short and as little ranting as possible. we had a football game tonight and i think that we did reall well, at least the guard did, but so did that band. after the show, mr prunk gaves us the usual talk about the show and then told us that there was to be no making out in uniform. just about everybody in the band looked at kasey and i. we have NEVER ONCE made out in public, nu uh, not cool. that statement was directed at a certain band dads child, and the only reason they never get in trouble for it is cause his dad is like, the life source of the band. well, kaseys parents work with the band too! seriously, right now im so mad, so embarresed, and just plain insulted. im being such a baby about this, but seriuosly, we both have more moral and intelligence to do that in public. im have no idea why, but im almost on the verge of tears because of those stupid idiots. ok, so im done, i just needed to get that out of my system. so wish us luck tomorrow at the grants pass marching band compitition! love!"

"event","so today was great. i got 12 hours of sleep...first time in a LONG time. i woke up, showered (mind you, showering is a privilage now, especially to shower alone) and then kasey came over about 11:30. well, needless to say, i had an amazing time. im not sure about him however cause hes rather worried about something that happened. i honestly dont think he has anything to worry about. sure, maybe we coulda cooled things down abit, but other than that, i didnt see anything wrong. i dont know, i had fun, lol. i swear, i think hes one of the best things to happen to me. just like tessa. i mean, to be dating my best friend, yeah, i dont think i could ask for anything else. people keep thinking/saying that were going to get married, and its kinda funny. it honestly doesnt seem like that odd of a concept to me, but its so far away that im not even thinking of it. yeah, but anyway. so after he left i took a nap (still catching up on my sleep), talked to tess, did laundry and took the dogs for a walk. i can out run them now!!! I GET TO GO TO THE BEACH WTIH TESS TOMARROW!!!! yeah!!! im so excited! i cant wait to spend time with her!!!! i missed her so much this summer. shes the bestes friend i could ever ask for. anyhow, i should be going now, time to finish laundry. love!"

so yeah, i got home about 2 am this morning, tess, kasey, and my mom and sister all came to pick me up, it was great. and today i went to my dads house and ate mac and cheee...mmmm. and then went to kaseys house. i missed him so much, i was really glade to go over there, and i think hes coming over here tomarrow, which is great. i swear he spoils me. on our anniversary he gave me 3 roses (fake, but thats better cause i was living on a bus for a month) and when i came home there was a resent for me on my bed...little penguins holding a purple heart, it was the cutest thing ever! i missed tessa so much too...nobody at corp reaLly got my little quirks or habbits or thingsof the sort. i get to go to the beach with her wednesday night, and thatll be so much fun. im so ready for that. but now i thin ill go and clean my room.

tess- smile and dont let the bad things get to you. i love you and i know youre gonna be great and im gonna miss you terribly all summer. no one gets my randomness! 
kasey- i never thought wed end up here again, but i sure as heck am glade we did. im gonna miss you like nothing else and i cant wait till we get back and can talk in person again. i love u."

"event","yeah for the 4th of july! lol. it was like, the best day ever. i spent absolutly all day with kasey, and dont regret a single moment of it. he came to church in the morning, which was cool. and then we went and saw spiderman 2, lol, i think we held hands the entire movie. the movie was pretty cool, left it open for yet another spiderman. after the movie we went to his house. id never been over there before so it was fun. basically all we did was eat lunch and sit on the couch and sleep, which i think is all i coulda asked for. he slept on me for about an hour and a half, and i did the same. it was almost sleep though, so we were still kinda talking. seriously, i was so comfortable just sitting in his arms. his parents came home to discover me in the house while no one was home and didnt like the idea to much. im really hoping he doesnt get in trouble. yeah, so after we hung around there for a while, we went for a walk and as soon as we got back, we left for independance to see fire works with his brother and brothers girlfriend. ive never ridden in a topless jeep before(that sounds so funny) so it was an entertaining ride. he just put his arms around me and we went on our way. :-D. the fire works were awesome, especially now that (sappy chick flick moment...) they have kind of a special thing to em. we decided to get together officially last night. it wasnt an asked thing, it was more mutually decided upon. it was great. we drove home, and again, i almost feel asleep...i swear its something about the boy. we light off fire works at his house with his brother and his girlfriend, actually it was more they light them off while we watched. they like to play with fire appearantly. but yeah, i got home about midnight. now to tell my parents...lol. im not ashamed in anyway, im just worried that they wont let me see him as much now that were together, and thats definetly not what i want. eh well, itll come out sooner or later. i think thats all. have a great day guys! i know i did! love"

"event","so yeah, ASHLEYS SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW!!!!! these past couple of days have been totally out there and such a blur. i got home sunday night/monday morning. monday when i finally got out of bed, i read an email from kasey that explained his feelings for me, a little vague, but he still just absolutly made me melt. ""Ash, im not quite sure wut kinda spell u put me under, but it sure is workin its magic...that hug today, thats gonna last for a very long time....the laughter (whether it was forced or not) is going to stay in my mind for a very long time. and if u remember any of the songs (particularly the first song that we actually listened to the whole thing) on that cd that i had..that one song right now is makin u circulate in my head like a frickin carousel."" we talked about the email a couple days ago, and at the point, i really didnt have any feelings for him, atleast romantically. but believe me, the thought has crossed my mind on more than one occasion. so yeah, then he told me to go to this site where hes been posting and when i could read what his true feelings were about the whole thing, and what other people had to say about it. yeah, there was alot there that i didnt know. GA!!!!!! this is crazy! because i think before i was kind of denying any feelings i had for him because of his gf, and the fact that we had already happened and it didnt work. but now, i dont know, those feelings are starting to resurface, and their coming up strong. but at the same time, i dont want to jeprodize anything...our friendship, his relationship with anne marie, tessas feelings on the subject and her involvment...theres just so much to be thought about! but its a good thing im leaving this summer because that way we can think about it without being in close contact all the time for more of a logical decision, if that makes sense. if he finds my journal, then hell know what i think, but im not entirly sure he reads these. the more and more i think about it, the more and more i want to persue something again and see what/where it ends up. i love the boy, and the fact that im considering him romantically again is kinda freakin me out. i feel so bad that his gf has to be background to this, and that she really doesnt know, as far as anybody knows. i think shes a sweetheart, and i dont want her to be left hanging while kasey and i play this stupid game of what to do. but omg, just thinking about it is kinda making me happy. the thought of us together again is becoming more and more plausable and right. i really wish tessa was home for help with this. i know shes talked to kasey about it all, but i really havent had a chance to talk to her yet. GA! anyhow, i think thats all i have to say for now, i think i need to think somemore, lol. love"

"event","ooooh wow, ive said before that high school should be a soap, but ratings couldnt be any higher then if they showed the events of today. ok, to start the day off, im freaking out over leaving for corp and about went into major melt down last night and today. i guess im just scared of being forgetton or replaced or something like that. but whatever. so anyhow, i get to lunch today and none of my best friends are there, just a butt load of freshman *grr*. but when my friends finally show up, they look PISSED. no one would tell me what was wronge either, so to add to my paranoia, im freaking out because im really worried about whats going on. now i know, but still, talk about emotional collapse. and to top it off, i have corp tonight. all i can say is that if ron is a butt head today, i dont know that i can handle, he better be nice!!!! maybe sam can make me feel better, lol :-D. anyhow, i best be off, see yall monday! love!"

"event","just got back from another weekend at drum corp. it was really good actually. i really feel like ive improved so much since the last camp. i can actually do the work AND march at the same time!!! lol. ron, my coach, is a butt head though, hes so rude sometimes. but people keep telling me i just have to get used to him. they did however tell me that i was lead flag in flag line! flag line is when half are on flag and half are on riffle, i was kinda excited. ug, im so sore and achy right now its not even funny. i talked to sam just a little bit cause i thought he was gonna drop a water bottle over my head, but im not gonna explain that one. i think thats about all i have to say for now. 2 more camps till tour!!! love"

"event","drum corp is this weekend, yeah! sorta. i still get nervous going up there, and i really dont know why. i guess its cause im like, one of the least experianced people there, which is crazy cause ive been doing guard for almost 4 and a half years, counting 8th grade. oh well, ill eventually get it. but it just seems they all have an advantage over me because they all live up where camps are held, so they can have extra practices and are already used to the coachs and their techniques. whatever, ill live. i do however, get to see sam, and i intend on stricking up a conversation with him, over what i have no idea, lol. 
kasey decided to drop by last night, scared the bejebus outta me. i was sitten on the phone talking to tess and my sister comes running in telling me hes here, and of course, since it was laundry day, i was in my pjs. so i had to get dressed really quickly. but it was fun, we talked to tess on the phone for a while.
whatelse happend today...i dont think a whole lot did actually. oh, congrats to jon for drum major, even though the way they chose was not in the least bit fair, i mean, jons good and all, but if they didnt want a senior to do it, they should have said so. its only common curtosy. 
anyhow, i think thats it. see you all monday! love!"

"event","Last night i went down to portland for the exploding hearts tribute show. It was like 100 fucking degrees out and about 200 in the venue. The first show the briefs and spits played , it was fun but hot as hell. Then there was a bar show with the riffs and the epoxies. I got in through the backdoor. That show was really fun , i havent seen the riffs play in a long time. The epoxies were cool too. The riffs did a couple dead heart songs with terry, that was cool but u know sad.  I've only gotten a few hours of sleep so im writing weird short sentences. This is why i've only gotten a few hours sleep- We left portland around 3 a.m and on the way home my FUCKING car stopped working.We got off the freeeway and at this stoplight it just totally stopped working so we had to fucking push it , you would think that someone would fucking stop and help 2 girls in mini skirts, but no.  So about 45 mins from home we were at an ampm and my parents didnt get my phone call until like 5. We got bored as hell so we played scrabble outside on the sidewalk lol. So anyways, we finally got home around like 7 am, i slept for a few hours but now im awake and blah blah blah ."

"event","Well..this weekend was somewhat interesting. On friday night quiet riot played at a bar in downtown olympia. My friend mandy was with me and we couldnt get in because we arent 21 and we weren't going to pay 15 bux. screw that. So we were standing outside listenin to them and this guy comes up and hes like hey you ladies wanna get in follow me. So he goes to the backdoor and tells the person oh im a roadie and these chicks are with me. so we get in for free, and then he buys us beer ..theres only a few songs i like by them and one of them is a song they stole from slade (cum on feel the noise) but it was still fun.  Ok then Saturday night i went and saw the briefs and the rabid dogs in seattle.. pretty good show. Except for afterwards there was like one party and it sucked. Now ive just been sitting at home bored .. been writing some shit in my notebook. Thats all for now."

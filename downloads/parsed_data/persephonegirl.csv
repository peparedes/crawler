I celebrate the time and effort I put into my daily rituals.
Washing dishes, sweeping floors, brushing my hair, these monotonous mindless actions put me at ease.
In them I can revel in thought.
I give thanks for my loved ones, people who come into and out of the tide of my life. 

A Poem for love that surrounds me........


""Salutation""

O generation of the thoroughly smug
   and thoroughly uncomfortable,
I have seen fishermen picnicking in the sun,
I have seen them with their untidy families,
I have seen their smiles full of teeth   
   and heard ungainly laughter.
And I am happier than you are,
And they were happier than I am;
And the fish swim in the lake
   and do not even own clothing.""

Ezra Pound~"

""Beware of turning into the enemy you most fear. All it takes is to lash out violently at someone who has done you some grievous harm, proclaiming that only your pain matters in this world. More than against that person's body, you will then, at that moment, be committing a crime against your own imagination.""

I was alone like a tunnel. The birds flew from me,
and night swamped me with its crushing invasion.
To survive myself I forged you like a weapon,
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling.

But the hour of vengeance falls, and I love you.
Body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk.
Oh the goblets of the breast! Oh the eyes of absence!
Oh the roses of the pubis! Oh your voice, slow and sad!

Body of my woman, I will persist in your grace.
My thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road!
Dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache.

A Poem (not by me).


Confederate States

It is so simple: our domesticated life
of tea and speculation, the armature of the trees
ample and contained outside the windows. We dream of Georgia,
of Michigan and Paris,
and go nowhere. This morning
     our bodies
might have saved us, but they didn't, charged
with nothing but physical contortion, a petty
fervor soon waning. We read books
and talk, assessing this, assessing that.
I have become more careful
than I ever thought possible, suited to an arrangement
which I don't defy. Why don't
     we light a fire in the middle of the room?
Why don't we sell bits of colored glass
at the beach? I am tired
and almost happy, though still I want to throw my life away,
some way I can't remember. The wind climbs furiously
in the oaks, but it is only wind,
no voice or metaphor for anything else. It is
     an adjustment, they say,
marriage, these orderly days, card games
and late supper, radishes carved to crowns. Brevet husband,
     I picture myself at twelve
sitting by the clear river I was raised on,
dragging a stick to attract bream. Trees
     stood in the water
and I imagined them drowning, the water
heaved upward through muscle of pine,
choking resin, seeping into the spines of the needles-
     nothing else to do but fall.

People you hate will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down
You'll frown
They'll tie you and drag you through town
But you still don't like to leave before the end of the movie
No you still don't like to leave before the end of the show.

I can clearly see which direction I am heading.
My eyes are clear.

It is good to know where my energy is best served."

"event","being back at school.
Don't get me wrong, i know it's tons o' work but i love the environment.
Learning is good.
I will thrive and give myself drive so that I can feel alive.
Hah! I make myself laugh sometimes over the dummest thing like a silly ryhme-
i am a weirdo for sure....

I believe that education is the only thing that nobody can ever take away from you.
So mote it be."

"event","Soul food
Black Bean and Ham 
Potato
Lentil 
Minestrone 
Hungarian Mushroom
I'd like my bowl piping hot with a thick slice of bread the butter falling off it
Fill it all the way to the top 
Spilling over onto the linen beneath.

Finishing my share
I begin to think about it
Life that is; 

Suddenly
I feel satisfied."

"event","So sad that the sun will hide behind clouds of rain for the next seven moons.
i love Fall don't get me wrong, its just that I really really love sunshine.
I prefer tanktops to turtlenecks, bathing suits to gollashes.
I want to feel heat radiating on my back, warming me from the outside in.
If the rain must come then I will find refuge in the solitude of Winter.
I will go inside and burrow into my brain, encouraging growth and depth.
Warm waters of Breitenbush wash over me and keep me content.
Great forests I will walk with you and listen, 
quietly waiting for the sunshine to Spring up."

I just sauteed the best rainbow of earth out there.
Green Beans, poatatoes, zucchinni, tomatoes = yumminess.
Energy.

It almost makes me forget my hair is so short.
growth is good."

<b><u>JANUARY</b></u>
<s>1/20 - Underworld: Awakening</s> [aka Underworld 4]
<i>[Review:]</i> A+. I fucking love everything about every Underworld movie. This is no exception. More please!

<b><u>FEBRUARY</b></u>
2/3 - <s>The Woman in Black</s> Good!
2/17 - <s>This Means War</s> Good!

<b><u>MARCH</b></u>
<s>3/16 - 21 Jump Street</s>
<s>3/23 - The Hunger Games</s>
<i>[Review:]</i> I liked it well enough, but still wish they would have allowed it the R rating it needed to really make it truer to the book. The injuries, terror and desperation are much more palpable in the book because Suzanne wasn't trying to go for a PG rating. Still a good movie though.

<b><u>APRIL</b></u>
<s>4/1 - Three Stooges</s>
<s>4/1 - Game of Thrones Season 2 Premiere</s>
<i>[Review:]</i> Amazing. It's Game of Thrones so of course it was.

4/13 - <i>Lockout</i>
4/27 - <b>The Five Year Engagement</b>

"event","That's right, on this day 1 whole year ago Justin turned to me and said ""I caught a promo for this show at work Today; never heard of it before but it's supposedly meta with them breaking the fourth wall, wanna watch?"" 

Yup, it was 'The French Mistake' 6x14 and we laughed so hard that even without knowing any of the backstory we went out and bought the Season 1 DVDs. By 1x02 I was more than hooked, we ate up every morsel of this show that we could (funnily enough, every time we were close to being done with a Season, the next one would drop drastically in price so we were able to afford it-divine fucking intervention people!!) We loved it so much that we stayed up wayyy later than usual, we watched for weeks and were actually able to catch up to the current episodes and watched 6x15 live when it aired last March.

And then I found minion-dome, and kale, and GISHWHES'D til the last second, and made a fucking 6 lb dress out of bacon, became a calendar girl (Miss September), helped break a fucking world record, helped actually save lives with charity work, did so many random acts of kindness and donated so much that I'm not just addicted to Supernatural but addicted to doing more good things.

I LOVE Dean, Cas, Sam, Bobby, John, Mary, Gabriel, Death, Lucifer, Ellen, Jo, Crowley, and Ruby. And I LOVE Jensen, Danneel, Jared, Gen, Misha, Vicki, West, Rich, Matt, Mark P, Mark S, Chad, Rob, Jim, Kim, Alona, Sam (Fucking everyone in this fucking bar) I don't care what you ship as long as you don't care what I ship.

I've seen every episode at least 4 times by now, gotten dozens of my friends into the show as well and sat next to them as they went down the same Winchester Road. Sat on twitter for weekends at a time waiting for fellow fans to update from cons, watched insane amounts of panel footage and interviews.

I'm also still shaking my fists at the CW for their piss-poor advertisements, where the fuck were they 7 years ago? I'd been watching Smallville on the same damn network for YEARS (I mean, fuck Jensen was ON Smallville!) and I'd never heard a whisper of this glorious show before my Fiance last year. The Fuck CW? This show is a masterpiece, you damn well need to showcase it!

Because Supernatural is so much more than a TV show, the actors, the crew, the cast; they stick together and get each others backs and try and start charity's to use their fame for good; they meet fans on weekends and make fucking month long trips to Haiti to build orphanages."

"event","<i><b>1. Your first cosplay.</i></b>
Technically I suppose my first cosplay was an awful Sailor Neptune costume I bought off ebay and wore for a shotty picture when I was at home. But in my eyes my first ""official"" cosplay that I  wore to my first Anime Convention (Anime Central 2001) was Sana Kurata from Kodomo no Omocha. I then re-wore it at Shoujocon 2001 because I'd had absolutely SO much fun with it.

<i><b>2. How many costumes have you done?</i></b>
Somewhere in the 25-30 region I suppose, I don't actually have photos of ALL of them though, which is a great sadness to me.

<i><b>3. Your most recent cosplay.</i></b>
Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood at Youmacon 2010 in Detroit, MI.

<i><b>6. Your favorite cosplay (that you have done).</i></b>
I'd have to say <i>Wonder Leia Version 2.0</i> (though I love the feeling I get when I'm in my Beetlejuice Costume...I just love stripes!) the level of craftsmanship and time from version 1 to 2 was like leaps & bounds. I like that there aren't a million of 'me' going around at conventions beause I'm the person that 'brought life' to the idea that Jay had, and its always fun to hear the wide range of compliments people have regarding it.

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/vannadear/pic/0003b9xb/s640x480"" />

<i><b>7. The character that you have cosplayed that is *most* similar to you (if none that you have cosplayed, then one that you will cosplay)</i></b>
I typically only cosplay characters that I share either a personality or a lot in common with; it's difficult for me to toil away making a costume for a character I don't ""believe in"" though I suppose the ones I am most like are: Sana, Remus, Hermione and Lydia Juice. 

<i><b>8. Your cosplay plans for the rest of the year (if you have no more for this year, then do next year!</i></b>
A lot of necessary life expenses are coming up/have been coming up lately (House/Wedding/School etc.) so I'm trying to keep it to the 'bare minimum' of one costume per season.

<b>Fall 2011</b> - Kaylee Frye from Firefly at Detroit Fanfares, Youmacon (if I go) and Halloween
<b>Spring 2012</b> - Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen from Game of Thrones at Motor City Comic Con

<i><b>9. The dream cosplay that *might* just happen.</i></b>
My dream cosplay list is insanely long, but the two I've always wanted to cosplay as are Usagi Tsukino as Sailor Moon and Duo Maxwell from Gundam Wing. I have a lot of the components but have never had the chance to complete them. So they just might happen someday.

<i><b>10. The dream cosplay that will *never* happen.</i></b>
I have a hard time letting go of the hope that I'll eventually get to cosplay all the characters I love, but the truth is that like 90% of the ones I really want to do will never happen...and the list is just so so long ^^;

<i><b>11. Something cosplay-related that you will never do (eg. crossplay, cosplay from a certain series)</i></b>
super!Skimpy costumes for sure! (I know a lot of you are about to argue that Wonder Leia and Black Canary classify as 'skimpy' but they are both relatively covered up compared to a lot of costumes that only consist of a few shreds of fabric, (barely there bikinis for example) BC and Wonder Leia? those two are as skimpy as I'm ever willing to be!

<i><b>12. Your cosplay idol(s)</i></b> (alphabetically because I love them all equally)
<lj user=""daenerys""> <lj user=""lovemeeko""> <lj user=""proplady""> <lj user=""queenginny"">
<lj user=""sailormoon""> <lj user=""sarielchan""> <lj user=""scruffyrebel""> <lj user=""sunseenli"">

<i><b>13. Your cosplay specialty (i.e. something that seems to apply to a large amount of your cosplays, it could be a specific series, or a common feature in their appearance, such as glasses)</i></b>
I seem to have an inordinate amount of cosplays with pink hair, but I think the armor that I've been getting into lately (Wonder Leia & Ed Elric) would be more where I'm headed lately...

<i><b>14. Your cosplay-making habits (eg. singing while working on cosplay)</i></b>
Complete and total focus. I sketch and doodle and pull up reference pics and take measurements and research other cosplayers that have done similar costumes so I can get an idea of what fabrics/materials work/don't work. Then I'll typically put a DVD box set on the TV for background noise, but then I also tend to completely ignore it and everything else (bathroom, food, human contact, the sun) and I go to town until I realize 15 hours later that my back is killing me from crouching over, my stomach is growling ferociously and my bladder is screaming. 

<i><b>15. Your least favorite thing about cosplay</i></b>
<u>The judgment & The cost.</u>
Everyone knows that cosplay is an expensive hobby, and I often feel guilty about the amount of money I spend getting the costumes right. The judgment part is the real killer though. First there's the personal judgment of physical attributes & ability to pull off the costume, then there's the personal judgment of putting the costume on when its done (after spending hours and hours and sweat, blood & tears and realizing that it's just not something you'd want to wear in public.

Judgment from the public is even worse, though I don't mind judgment so much when it comes from other cosplayers (more specifically cosplayers that have really good costumes) because at that point I'm listening intently for constructive criticism-but that's just not the case 99% of the time.

The type of judgment cosplayers face? It's usually someone who's never dressed up beyond a cheap store-bought costume for Halloween, who doesn't even know the character/show and who couldn't sew together two pieces of felt with a needle & thread. Or to a lesser extent, its another cosplayer who isn't up to par with you, either way-words hurt. I'm proud to say that if I ever feel the need to point out a fellow cosplayers flaws/inaccuracies, its either in private or a very hushed whisper when said-cosplayer is in sight and 20 ft or more away, because I would never want to be so terrible as to drag someone down when they're proud of their accomplishment.

There's a million different 'levels' of cosplay in my eyes, at the tippy-top there's the fabulous ladies that I idolize (see #12) and look to for their standards, and there's a million different levels below them. I see myself as somewhere in the middle, I'm certainly not the worst cosplayer out there, but there is no way I'm close to the best, but just because I'm average doesn't mean that 

I'm not going to keep trying to do better, and it doesn't mean I'm going to scoff at someone to their face and tell them that they're too short/tall/scrawny/fat etc. to wear that.

<i><b>16. Do you belong to any cosplay groups? If so, what are they?</i></b>
I've joined in on a couple skits, but not a dedicated group, no.

<i><b>17. What events have you cosplay to?</i></b>
Anime Central 2001-2002
Shoujocon 2001
Motor City Comic Con 2002-2010
Nekocon 2002-2004
Youmacon 2006-2010
Harry Potter Midnight Release Movie/Book Parties

<i><b>18. What is your best cosplay memory?</i></b>
In order of when they occurred:
<b>Meeting Scott McNeil</b> (Duo Maxwell- Gundam Wing) in the dealers room of Acen 2K1 on Friday and having him (on camera) say to me ""And I'll become the God of Death once more - but right now? I need a hug"" and glomping me. Then waiting in line the next day for he and Kirby Morrow(Trowa Barton - Gundam Wing) to sign stuff and having Scott not only remember me from the day before, but for him to have remembered my name-introduce me to Kirby and then ask if he could have another hug. Scott then had Kirby take a picture of the T-shirt I had airbrushed of Duo & Heero once he and Kirby signed signed it on his personal camera <3 [There may have also been a moment where Scott swooped me into his arms princess style for a photo-op, commented on how light and tiny I was and then gallantly set me back on the ground <3] What a con to NOT have a camera at T_T

<b>Being a (small) part of the group that Won 'Best in Show' at Nekocon for the 'Quest for the Sword' Skit that Jen wrote.</b> The most hilarious script ever in suessian rhyme. That fine group of ladies I spent every waking moment of that convention with (We even did a Gravitation Cosplay <3 soooo fun)  We stayed up insanely late to finish my crappy Jakotsu costume, and throughout the following days would have the most random nap sessions at the most random times, go to Zennys and talk with fun old waitresses about the costumes that we were still wearing. I'll never forgot those ladies and how amazingly awesome they were with me, a total brat from MI.'

<b>Wearing the Wonder Leia costume.</b> It didn't seem to matter to anyone (but me) which version I was wearing...but the response of people to that costume ranges from tiny adorable toddlers shyly tugging on my skirt wordlessly so their parents can ask for a photo for their kid to brazen little batgirls mischievously whispering to me ""My mom is gonna be SO sad she missed out on meeting you! Imma tell her we had a real superhero here and she MISSED IT!!"" to the Rebel Legion and 501st members (the REAL star wars costumers!) asking to take a photo with ME (and I'm thinking ""Why me? You're the one with the REAL costume, huh?"") to groups of Stormtroopers huddling around me and muttering 'ding' when I walk by LOL.

I've made John Schneider blush with Black Canary. But Wonder Leia somehow inspires celebs to come up to me. To me. Like wtf? Daniel Logan, Doug Jones, Ray Park and *Carrie Fisher* (yes, Leia herself!) all at some time or another have come up to me and said how much they loved my costume and the originality of it. And I stand there like 'Guh, Ger..uh..thank you so much!' and that doesn't even feel like it means anything because its inadequate to the complete and total SQUEE that they make me feel inside. 

<i><b>19. What is your worst cosplay memory?</i></b>
Anytime something fails. Anytime I realize that I killed myself researching, drafting, dieting, creating and the finished product isn't good enough. That I wasted all that time and money, and I've built up anticipation for this costume and now its not even good for scrap.

Anytime I finish a costume and wear it all day and realize I didn't get a picture of it. Memories are amazing but pictures are so much more solid. 

Anytime a friend sends me a link to some website that rips apart my and other peoples hard work. Why would you sit around all day finding photos of people so you could comment intelligently on how you'd like to 'hit that but only if her face was covered' or to say how it was 'a piss poor attempt' or that they're 'too out of shape' or 'fat' for that particular costume.

<i><b>20. Have you won any cosplay awards?</i></b>
I don't enter costume contests usually, the last time was Nekocon with the Best in Show skit award, but we all know that was solely due to Jen, Kell and Beth :)"

"event","I woke up this morning to an even shinier day than I imagined. New York actually pulled the blinders off and passed the gay marriage law! *squee*

My heart actually swelled when I read that, and then I felt immensley saddened because we really shouldn't need to define ""Gay Marriage"" or ""Straight Marriage"" - its just *love* people, all of it.

I'm so happy New York opened their eyes but so sad the other 44 states (Michigan included) are still grasping strong to their old archaic beliefs.

And call me naive, but I really just can't understand why so many people can't mature passed the ""way they were raised to think about homosexuality,"" and open their eyes to the truth of it.Yes some girls like other girls, yes some boys like other boys, and some boys like girls. WHAT is the issue with that? WHY has it taken this long for these laws to get passed?

Also, if you comment on this with some insane rant about 'God hating homosexuals' I will graciously come over to your house to hit you with a shovel-in your face. Don't be stupid. If you believe everything that came out of the bible you'd be one of those Westboro loonies and I'd (again) have to get out my shovel.

Okay, so if you click on the Canary you'll be taken to my FlickR with all the pictures I ninja'd away from Justin yesterday. These are all I have of the con and my costumes until Jay Fife or Justin Chung e-mail the rest of them to me...I'm most exited about the Wonder Leia with the action figure backdrop <3 teehee"

It's a question of if FOX will royally fuck Dollhouse's chances of success by giving it the shittiest air times in favor of its reality show blunders.

Fox did it to Kitchen Confidential, and then to Firefly...will we let them bury Dollhouse too?

Watch the Premiere episode tonight at 9PM, or DV-R it, whatever, just GIVE IT THE CHANCE THAT FOX WON'T!!!

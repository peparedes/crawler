Pick ANY 20 lj users on your friends list. Without revealing their names, say something about (or to) each one of them. Never reveal who is what.

1. We have the best childhood memories together. You are always a week older than me! :) We have unfortunately grown distant over the past few years.. But, we are going to work our '<i>weekly luncheon</i>' into both of our busy schedules this summer.

2. In the past we '<i>had it bad</i>' for a sexy stud & a sexy mexican. You lost my new cell phone in the ocean while we were acting stupid & singing '<i>Sex On The Beach</i>'.. But, I still loved ya anyway! :)

3. You sat with me for hours in the ER when I burnt my eye on the curling iron. '<i>Girls, this is History class not Cosmetology</i>'. We always got yelled at in there for putting on make-up. & at state when we heard those '<i>people</i>' running up & down the halls.. gosh, who does that? ;)

4. You used the name '<i>Danielle</i>' when you called someone late one night. So, the next time I do something like that, I'm using your name! :)

5. We hated each other Kindergarden-3rd grade but now, you're one of my best. We had an 8th grade after-prom party at your house & we all had a blast. We had 2 classes together this year & we always had something/someone to talk about. We really need to get together sometime over the summer. I miss ya!!

6. Remember a few years back when Bryan Bentley dumped me for you? Gosh, I hated you for the longest time.. I love ya now, tho! :)

7. I put you as #7 because well, you know why. We have known each other since Kindergarden. You're my *twin* & one of my bestest. Our first trip to Kingsport ALONE & the quick trip into GC. '<i>Omg, that was his brother</i>'. We have so many memories!!

8. The first time I saw ya was in Reno's one night while I was with Jill. We didn't get along well at all after I told you who my boyfriend was.. because of all the rumors! :) But, I'm glad all that has passed.

9. We try to get along but, it doesn't work too well. In 3rd grade me, you & Courtney would take turns being friends. & one year you took Linzy, Hannah & I to Gatlinburge with ya & we stayed in our own room. We thought we were so cool! :)

10. Last year we would take '<i>road trips</i>' to Gate City & places. & on the way back from the pageant a few '<i>PV</i>' guys were beside of us wanting to race. '<i>I can't look, I can't look</i>'! We were really close for a while but, we hardly talk anymore.. I miss ya, gal!

11. We literally hated each other for a while & one time even had a n/a war. Then one night, Jerrett, Erik & I came by & picked you up & we resolved everything later that night.. I think? :)

12. We were best friends for a while & would sing '<i>Spice Girls</i>' on the phone to each other. Viva Forever! :) & remember that restaurant thingy we had up in my room? We made all those stupid menu's & stuff. Gosh, those were the days.

13. We recently went to a baseball game together. We had all those guy talks & everything else. We never ever talk anymore either.. Oh yeah, my blanket & stuff is still in the back of your car.

14. It was a lot of fun helping you with cheerleading. It's also cool because we have the same name & act alike. You were keeping me informed about what '<i>those girls</i>' were sayin' about me at the BFF. haha!

15. I'm not even sure how we met.. But, one day we just started talking on ICQ. Hint-I was talking to you today about how your aunt & uncle live in Wise! :)

16. We go to the same church & had a pretty intense tennis match one day in gym class. haha.

17. Everytime I would see you *2*, you all would have a different guy with ya at the BFF. Spanish was great with you all.. Everyday you all would have a new joke to tell. & I still remember your song '<i>In Southwest VA born & raised</i>..'

18. Only 2 things to say.. Your Parents & High Knob! *<i>laughs</i>*

19. You gave me your seat on the bus on the way back from DollyWood & I was so thankful.. minus that person staring at me the *<i>whole</i>* way back! :) We will have to hangout again sometime, sister!

20. Alright well.. this person isn't a LJ friend but, oh well. We have became SO close this summer. You're definitely my bestest! I have no clue what I'm gonna do without ya for the next 2 week while you'll be on your cruise & at basketball camp. But, when you get back we will be going to the *BeAcH* woohoo! :) We always have so much to talk about & we have so many memories that of course we don't need to go into. <i>*laughs*</i> Just remember to keep our '<i>theme</i>' song in mind at all times! :) But, oh gosh.. I have some stuff I need to tell you. You'll be happy too!! LOVE YOU!

Okay, enough with that. It was pretty fun, though!
My summer is going wonderful. Summer & I have been keepin' the roads hot ever since I got my licenses. Gosh! It's been fun.

I got a job at the Wise Pool & so far, so good! :)

Well, today was the worst day ever! I didn't want to get up.. I guess staying up late every night on the phone with Brian is slowing catching up to me. I didn't feel well this morning so, that might have been it, as well. & to beat it all, I fell on my butt going down the stairs. I think that was the most embarrassing experience ever! Luckily, Jerrett happened to be walking up as I was coming down & he helped me up. *<i>haha</i>* It's pretty funny when I look back on it. 4th block is always fun! I love my girls..
'<i>U G L Y</i>' Oh yeah, I couldn't get my gym locker open either.. Everyone tried for about 15 mins then I finally realized that was the wrong combination. Gosh, I'm ditzy at times..

I get my hair cut tomorrow after school.. I'm excited! I'm so ready for a change.

We have our first cheerleading practice Friday. I'm anxious to see how that goes.

4 months for Brian & I on the 11th. Aw! It's precious.. :)

Wow, what a day! Sumpter wasn't there so, that made my day 100 times better. Cheerleading tryouts went great. I made Varsity.. & so did Jill. & my 3 D's (Dee, Dez & Danielle) made JV.. I think I was more excited for those 3 than I was for myself. They worked so hard & really came a long way! So, congrats to you all.. & everyone else who made it.

I just can't control myself
Can't be with no one else
Seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the Words you speak so deep
Our bodies meet, I have to have you

I love you you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

I think God made you for me
A mix of passion and fidelity
Baby you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be
To me, my lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend and my king

I love you you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different thing
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy."

Tori was suppose to spend the night with me last night. When we got back here I decided to take a shower. As soon as she heard the water running, guess who she called? The person whom she knows that I like very much...Travis. My mom over heard this convo and when we asked her about it, she lied. She was telling him <i>""you should be able to tell how much I like you, considering I'm calling you from Danielle's""</i> and that he should <i>""come and visit her soon""</i>, even though her house is a mess. I was mostly in shock that she would do that to me again & even more so that she called him from my own house. I come to find out that they have been talking on the phone for the past 2 weeks. That's definitely not what <i>""friends""</i> do to eachother! So, needless to say, she left last night!
People can be so deceiving!!

A big thanks to Adam! I talked to him for about 4 hours on the phone last night about everything. I don't know what I would have done without him. Love Ya!*
I plan on going out tonight and having a blast with Nessa & Linzy. If you need me, feel free to call my cell. :)"

"event","This week has been so hectic.. But over all, homecoming week has been a major success. I dressed up everyday so, I was proud of myself. The Male ""Beauty"" Pageant was definitely the funniest thing ever. <i>*laughs*</i> I enjoyed watching it.

Today was <i>Beach Wear Day</i>. With the help of Britt James, I dressed for the occasion. :) It was a little cold, but I seemed to manage. We played Coeburn tonight in girls basketball. We won! I think that we did pretty good cheerin'? Chloe'-Sssshhhh!! I did get to say hey to Christy though. I  miss ya, gal!

I have an FBLA Fall Conference at UVA--Wise in the morning, which will last until 4th block. Then, we are having a Pep Rally. I have to be at the Middle School at 5 to ride the fire truck with my fellow JV cheerleaders. :) Afterward, I'm coming home to get ready for the game/dance very quickly. Going to the game, then at 9:15 walking over to the dance. Monica is coming to pick me up afterward. We are coming back here & she's spending the night. Shew! I've got a busy day! On Saturday, Monica, Tosha & myself are going out..which will be fun. I Love You, Tosha..*haha*

-g'nite.
<i>*ssshhhh*</i> :)"

I guess I'll give a quick recap about my weekend. Friday Monica & I went to the Wise/vs/PV game. Saturday we went out again. We always seem to have the best time. We found Ness & Cat and rode around with them for a little while. Today I went to church then out to eat. My usual Sunday thing :)

<i>""and it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time""</i>--That's something I can relate to so much right now. What it is about him.. I have no idea. I just cannot seem to let go!

ive lost few friends but they are a large percentage of my over all social,
i miss lauren quite alot,
she was the best, and far too good to me,
i want to go out more and do things, meet new people, make some decent bridges,
re-build old-ens, find some one, one being the optimum word here,

i am not very content with my life most of the time, but every now and again i get to the point where i think i may have fuckerd it up and have trouble seeing where it will go from here, 

I have even more trouble seeing if it will get any better from here,

why am i boreing you with this? maybe because if no one is there to listen, you have great difficulty telling people, or both, then typing away on the internet is the easiest way of getting some things ""out in the open"" as such.

it still hurts just the same.

Work in progress...

Certain feelings you can ignor or at least try it they dont buy it, you cant deny it for sure.
Before, after you knew what you lost or threw away, you start to forget and bam, your
reminded one day, some way. Out of the blue she walks by, in here hand is the hand of some
guy you dont ask why. Blinded by pain, shocked from seeing her again.
She's so beautiful, some things never change. I turned over that page, and i cant re-write this tale.
Lets see what the next chapter brings, im sure pure failed, metaphotically i sailed,
but when on top reached the drop, i just jumped right off and impailed.
""I'm dont with it"" quoteation marks attached, not my words, but me they attacked.
There goes my last chance now i cant get it back.
Tried to turn back time but the clock hands snapped.
The memories of her now few and far between, try and hold tight presious thoughts
im harbouring, you cant replace the face of an angel with another,
she'll never look back at me like we were made for each other.
I used to drown myself in her soft gaze for hours,
felt like super man boosted with some crazy powers.
But this relation-tower, i made foundations cower.
The stupid choises i made leave a taste so sour.
Tried to have my cake and eat it but i made myself sick, bit off more that i could chew,
dont sugar coat i was a fucking prick,
Dont wish you to sympathize, the fuck up's was mine, ask myself repeted question, like
time after time. How could i hurt some one so much that i love so dearly.
Nearly felt like leaving but i know thats cowardly really.
I'm a new man now i hope, learnt from my mistakes,
They say lightning never strikes twice in the same place....

Fuckers.


I read some random fact on this website that said that there are more ways to arrange a standerd deck of playing cards then there have been seconds since the universe began. 

Bollocks right?

They even provide proof.  Check it.

-----------------------------------------------


Proof
 
There are 52 cards in a standard pack of playing cards.
The total number of ways of arranging such a pack of cards=52!

52! ~ 8.06582 x 1067 

The Univesre is thought to be between 10 and 16 billion (16,000,000,000) years old. That is 16 billion years since The Big Bang.
Let us assume the highest value of 16 x 109 years.

There are 60 seconds in a minute.
There are 60 minutes in an hour.
There are 24 hours in a day.
There are 365 days in a year (or 366 in a leap year). 

Therefore, the largest reasonable estimate for the number of seconds since the Universe began can be calculated as: 60 x 60 x 24 x 366 x 16,000,000,000 = 505958400000000000 seconds ~ 5.1 x 1017 

8.06582 x 1067 > 5.1 x 1017 (by a factor of 1.59 x 1050) 

Therefore it can clearly be seen that there are many more ways of arranging a standard set of playing cards than there have been seconds since the Universe began. Moreover, this will continue to be the case long after our own Sun and every other star in the Universe has run out of hydrogen and faded away approximately one hundred trillion years (1014) after the Big Bang, when the Universe will still be less than 3.2 x 1021seconds old. 

In fact, remarkably, there are even more ways of arranging half a pack of playing cards than there have been seconds since the Universe began, as 26! ~ 4.03 x 1026 > 5.1 x 1017

Thats it, im forcing myself to stop being a lazy twat, im going to do so much more shite from now.

For example make more web comics, maybe even draw some of them.


Sounds like a plan for now but i dred to think how it will plan out, im sure drinking heavily will be involved.
Last beer in the house and its been sat in the freezer for far too long. 


I miss people.

^^zowie was safe. Lalb.

"event","Now heres an interesting subject to think/talk about.

Im currently looking around alot of religions to help find one thats right for me and one that makes me feel comfortable. So far i am out of luck. 

I was bought up for most of my life as a christian, because of this i find it very difficult to deny any other beliefs (as my mother and father are still christians) and i do not find any reason to force my thoughs on religions on those who find comfort in what they follow. AS this is in fact excatly what i am looking for.

One thing i have found very interesting is that as it seems, i am most suited to Buddhism and its variations, however there are certain factors that lead me away from this as its seems to be that i would have to change myself and my own beliefs to follow as strictly as is required. This now opens up the argument of ""why is it required to floow religions to the T in order to be part of them?""


Generally im not getting anywhere fast and i have though about trying to form my own version of a religion through my own beliefs using others (adapted to suit myself of course) in order to find excatly what i am searching for. So far, not too good.

Take care.

Me, whitman, max, thomas, and gareth went to see bring me the horizon at the nexus with bella kiss supporting and jesus fuck was it damn funny.

Bare opportunities to beat down on some scene kid ass, you couldn't turn around with out seeing some one adjusting their fringe or passing out from the sheer face that their jeans are far too tight for comfort.

A few sucker punches and a random snakebite and black later and were on our way home, happy as larry at christmas.

"event","Phoebe walked along the beach for a very long time, just wandering.  She had no destination in mind, so long as she stayed on the beach. The waves and the wind were a little soothing to her as she remembered why she had come here today in the first place. <br /> <br /> Prue and Cole.<br /> <br /> It had been two years since Prue had died and one year since she had been forced to vanquish The Source and he had taken Cole with him.<br /> <br /> And so, she had come to the beach.<br /> <br /> Her sisters knew that she came to the beach a lot to think and to clear her mind. They didn't realize that she also came here because she felt she could talk to both Prue and Cole when she was here. She knew that Paige and Piper wouldn't say anything about her coming here to talk to Prue.  After all, some witches believed that their powers and their abilities had ties to nature. Her latest stint as a Goddess has given her a lot to think about where that was concerned. So, it was natural that she would come to the beach and the waves to talk to her big sister's spirit. There were times she could swear she felt Prue nearby and if she ever told her sisters about it she was positive that they would believe what she felt.<br /> <br /> However, she wasn't sure how they would react to the fact that she also spent a great deal of time talking to Cole when she was out here. She was still torn up about his death and hoped that wherever he was he understood why she had had to do what she had done. She hoped that he knew that she loved him and that she had never blamed him for anything the Source had done while possessing his body.<br /> <br /> She hoped that both of them knew how much she had hated having to say goodbye.<br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Muse:</span> Phoebe Halliwell<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fandom: </span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Charmed</span> <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Words: </span>326"

1. Write a ficlet that starts out with the phrase ""Untie me..."".</b>



""Untie me,"" Phoebe demanded as she glared at the demon standing in front of her.

""You're in no position to be making demands, little witch,"" he said as he drew the side of his knife gently along her face.

""And you're not going to be in much of a position to do anything when my sisters get ahold of you."" Phoebe glared it him as she tried to work her hands free from where he had tied them behind her and behind the chair.

""This trap isn't for your sisters. Of course, once you're gone, the Charmed Ones will be destroyed and I can track down your sisters at any time I want to.""

""Not for Piper and Paige, then who are you trying..."" Phoebe's voice died away as realization set in and her eyes widened.  ""Cole. You're after Cole.""

""Give the bimbo a cookie.  You're nowhere near as brainless as you look.""

""My brain isn't going to be the one spread across the entire county when Cole finds out you've taken me. He won't put up with anything like this.""

""You have such faith in your lover's human side, don't you? What about his demon? Do you think that when I force him into a rage large enough to shift into full demon form he'll give a damn about you? Hell, he's going to be the one who rends you wide open, little witch.""

Phoebe swallowed past the fear that suddenly rose up within her.  ""No matter what, Cole would never harm me.""

The demon smiled and then cocked his head, listening.  ""Looks like we're about to find out which one of us is right,"" he said as he moved behind her, yanking her hair back and putting the knife to her throat. ""He's coming.""

"event","There is one example of seeking absolution I can cite over and over again.

Cole Turner.

Cole is half-demon which by all rights should make him a deadly enemy of my sisters and I --- and at one time he was. At one time, he thought of nothing but how to kill all of us. There were a couple of times that he came pretty damn close to accomplishing that goal, too.

Then, something changed.

He had a prime opportunity to kill me and thus sever the power of the Charmed Ones forever. However, instead of taking advantage of that golden opportunity, he sent me back to my sisters so I could be safe and the three of us could work on our issues.

This in no way made him popular in the Underworld... and then when he killed the Triad instead of me and my sisters, the Source put a very large price on his head.

It didn't instantly garner him trust with my sisters, either. He had to really fight to earn everyone's trust... and prove that he loved me enough to turn his back on the Underworld and stick by that decision. I <i>knew</i> he loved me, or else I wouldn't have lied to Piper and Prue and pretended to vanquish him. However, my sisters required more than just what I saw in his eyes or felt when I looked at him.

Cole is still seeking absolution... and I have promised to be there the entire time.

b. You've been living a life filled with lies and it's time for you to come clean. There's one lie in particular that's been eating at you and you have to make right. Start off your response with: ""I have a confession to make. I never really . . . "" and explain the harm the lie caused and how you intend to rectify it.</b>


""I have a confession to make. I never really vanquished Cole,"" Phoebe swallowed hard as she looked across the table at her two sisters. She saw the anger filling Prue's eyes and the disbelief on Piper's face. ""I know I told you I did, but when it came down to it... I couldn't kill him. I loved him too much and I realized I could never do it when he killed the bounty hunter demon that was about to kill me."" She looked at the two of them, her eyes begging them to understand. ""When he saved my life, I knew what he had been telling me since we left his --""

""You mean since he kidnapped you!"" Prue corrected angrily.

""-- place was all true.  He did love me and he couldn't hurt me.""

""Phoebe!"" Piper exclaimed.  ""He tried to kill us... more than once!""

""I know,"" Phoebe whispered, her eyes filling with tears. ""When Andras caused that big fight to happen between us and we all lost our powers... he had a very good chance to kill me and he couldn't do it. He couldn't hurt me that night.""

""He attacked us later that same night!""

""It wasn't his fault,"" Phoebe pointed out.  ""Andras possessed him and used his body to come after us. Cole killed the Triad and made himself be put in danger because of me. I couldn't kill him.""

Prue started pacing angrily.  ""Not only have you been lying to us... but you put all three of us in danger.""

""He wouldn't hurt us,"" she said plaintively. ""Not now.""

""How can you think that?"" Piper asked her.  ""He has spent an entire year trying to kill us!""

""I know,"" Phoebe whispered.  ""But he's not going to hurt us... not now.""

""Why? Because you think he loves you?"" Prue demanded.

""Yes!""

""Phoebe, demons don't love!  They can't.""

""He's half human and he can.""

""I cannot believe you kept this from us, Phoebe,"" Piper frowned at her.

""I'm sorry,"" Phoebe whispered, looking down as the tears slipped down her cheeks. ""I know that I could have put us all in danger and I am so sorry. I know I could have caused us all to be killed when I let him go.""

""And yet you did.  How do you intend to try to fix this?""

""I don't know.  What I do know is that Cole is gone and he's not ever going to come back."" She shook her head. ""He's gone and he killed the Triad... that buys us some time.""

"event","She had been staring at the Book of Shadows for what seemed like days.  In truth, it had only been about four hours, but the frustration was the same. Banging her head on a desk would probably elicit just as many answers as the Book was giving her.

Phoebe sighed and ran her hand through her hair.

She had to keep trying to find answers.  She had to. The lives of Piper and her... as well as the orbing girl she and Cole had seen... could very well depend on it.

She started flipping through the book again, trying to understand everything that had happened.

Prue was dead... and instead of making the demons lay off of them, the Source was sending more demons out after them. Nobody seemed to understand why, but the Source was worried about the Power of Three re-forming to come after him. Which was impossible due to Prue being dead.

""Grams!"" she called out in frustration.  ""A little help here?!""

"event","She had never felt so powerless or so terrified in her life.

She was chained to what resembled a metal lattice...which was actually a type of human-sized grill.  When the Reverend Politician Craig ordered the switch to be thrown, she would be roasted alive.

A modern-day witch burning.

She could smell the fuel that was used to run this machine and it only made the fear turn into a near-choking panic.

It really didn't matter that <i>she</i> wasn't the correct guilty one, but there was no way she could explain it to Craig. If she told him that she was from the past and had come forward to see why her future self was about to die and had accidentally gotten trapped in her body... well, he'd have even more reason to burn her.

She still couldn't understand how all of this had come to pass. She didn't get how her future self could have used her powers to kill anybody.  Hers were passive viewing powers... precognition and empathy!  She didn't have any active or aggressive powers at all.

Craig was getting ready to have the switch thrown when everyone froze and went completely still.  Phoebe turned her head and there were Piper and Prue.

""Come on, Pheebs,"" Piper said as she and Prue unlocked her shackles. ""We have to get you out of here.""

Phoebe shook her head.  ""No, we can't."" There were tears slipping down her face. ""My future self killed someone and we were sent here to find out why I was going to die. Now we know.""

""He was a murderer!"" Prue protested.  ""We're not going to let you die because you killed a murdering bastard.""

Phoebe shook her head.  ""Murderer or not, it doesn't make what was done right.""

""Phoebe...""

""We protect the innocent... not punish the guilty."" She swallowed a sob.  ""With our powers comes respnsibility.  What she did wasn't responsible.  It was vengeful and it was wrong.""

Somehow, she held on to her courage and her determination to do what she knew was right.  She had tried to get Piper and Prue to leave so they didn't have to watch... but they wouldn't budge.  They refused to let her die alone.

The fire had been hot and it carressed itself around her as the body started being consumed.  She felt the heat as she started burning.

Just when the pain got overwhelming, something happened and the spell reversed itself.  She was safely back at home.

But she never forgot about that fire.

"event","Phoebe pressed herself as flat against the wall as she could as the demon stalked towards her with single-minded determination. He was between her and the door and she was pretty well trapped. He conjured a fireball in his hand and tossed it from hand to hand as he got closer to her.

""I'm going to make you burn, witch,"" he snarled, enjoying the fear he could see in her eyes.

Phoebe shook her head mutely, trying to figure a way out of this one.

How many times since becoming a Charmed One had she been threatened with fire or with fireballs? How many times had she come close to being set on fire just so a demon could prove a point or try to make an example of her?

""Phoebe duck!""

Phoebe dropped to the ground and watched a bottle slam into the demon threatening her.  Her eyes widened as he started burning in front of her and then exploded into little demony bits.

She shook her head and then looked at her sisters.

""Haven't these guys learned yet that it's dangerous to play with fire?""

"event","What can I say about Victor that would be fit for public viewing? Don't get me wrong, I love my father. It's just... it's difficult to explain.

See, I used to have a very romanticized idea about my father. True, he had walked out on our family after our mom died. True we didn't hear from him again until a few months after we got our powers.

I wasn't even two when Victor walked out on us and a big part of my life's drive when I was younger was to find my dad and reunite him with me and my sisters. I never knew him and I wanted to. I had this stupid idea that if I had my dad in my life, things would be so much better all around.

Then he came back and things got even more confusing. The first time I saw him... he called me Piper. He didn't even know who I was. I guess I understood. I was a baby the last time he saw me, but the first sting was still there.

That first time he came to see us, he wanted us to stop being who we were, he didn't want us to be witches. That's when he learned that we weren't little girls any longer and that if the three of us stuck together we'd survive. He left shortly after that... of course, that leaving included standing us up... again.

There have been any number of people that have passed through my life who have hurt me and made me wish that I had never come into contact with them at all. But in all of the time I've been on this Earth, I think the one person I probably need to forgive the most is Victor Bennett.

Sometimes he's called Dad, sometimes he's called Victor. What he's called is usually indicative of how much he's screwed up this time.

Ever since I was old enough to remember, I've wanted my dad to be a part of our lives. He was never around when I was growing up...and the main reason I had gone to New York was to find Dad.

The last time we saw him was at Prue's funeral.

I have a lot of sadness and a lot of anger where our dad is concerned.

I hope that one of these days I can learn to forgive him.

He comes in and out of our lives a lot now, kind of like a moth going from light to light. I try to keep him away from Cole. He's never liked the fact that I'm in love with a demon, and I doubt that's going to change now that Cole is back. I also know that Cole doesn't think much of him.  Part of his over-protectiveness about me getting hurt.

I know Dad is trying to change... I have to fight to remind myself of that sometimes. He loves us and we love him.

I just know now that having a dad around doesn't automatically solve all of the problems in your life, no matter how much you want them to.

"event","I think the best advice anyone ever gave to me was when Grams told me to be myself and embrace who I am.

When I was a teenager, I thought that was a strange thing for her to be saying to me.  I was the wild one as a teenager.  I was always pushing the limits in life --- and pushing the patience of those around me. I wasn't exactly the most responsible and I was hardly the good girl. Literally, I was a handful to both Grams and my sisters.

Yet, Grams always repeated that same advice to me throughout the years.

It wasn't until I was older and she was gone that I finally understand what she had been saying and why.

I was the youngest in the family and I never really felt that I fit in. Prue was the popular one.  Piper was the smart one.  I was the wild one. They both knew exactly what they wanted to do and what they wanted out of life.  For the longest time, I didn't have a clue.

Then, everything seemed to change.

I came back from New York a little worse for wear than when I had left. Piper welcomed me back with open arms. Prue didn't want me there.  It hurt, but I was used to it and so I pretended that it didn't matter.  I was still me.

When I read from the Book of Shadows and the three of us embraced our destiny, I finally understood what Grams had been telling me all those years.

I was just like her and I felt everything the deepest and the most intensely. For awhile, I was seen as the weakest of the Charmed Ones because I didn't have an active or aggressive power. I thought that way, too. That's how my own personality and everything I had done as a teenager helped me.  I embraced that I was sometimes wild and I embraced that I usually thought more with my heart than my intellect.

It's kept me alive.  It hasn't kept me from being hurt and heartbroken, but it has kept my sisters and I alive.

It was the best advice I have ever been given... even now.

"event","We all dream... some of us more than others.

I have several dreams that I dream on a regular basis.

I dream that my sisters and I will live to see our children be born and grow up healthy and happy. I have the dream that we will be able to marry the men we love and be left alone to be happy with them.

I dream that at some point, we'll be safe again and able to live free from demon attacks on us every day. I know that we're the Charmed Ones and we have a duty and a destiny... but it would be nice not to have to worry about being attacked every day.  It would be nice to have peace and safety.

I also dream of something that may seem much smaller than the demons attacking... but to me it is so very important.

I dream that someday, my family will accept that Cole is my husband and that he has changed for the good.

My dreams are what I cling to when things get dark and dangerous.

"event","<i><b>RotM 1.3 - Prompt Choices For Week of 4/16/2006---1. Write a first person ficlet that starts with the sentence:

""I know what you're thinking, but it wasn't my fault...""</b></i> 


""I know what you're thinking, but it wasn't my fault, Prue. I honestly didn't know that the Egyptian urn that Clay brought in was stolen.""

I could see from the look on her face that she didn't believe me. And why should she? It was well known that I was, am and always will be the Halliwell screw-up. That was accepted and expected and it didn't matter what I did or said differently. However, this was one of those times that I was indeed completely blameless in the events going on around me.

""Phoebe!  He could have cost me my job!  How could you be so...""

""So... <i>what</i>, Prue? I didn't know! How was I to expect that a flame from my past was going to show up on our doorstep in hopes that you'd fence stolen property for him!"" I think my voice almost turned into a wail at the end there, but how could it not? It hurt that even after everything I had tried to do to change myself, she would still see me as nothing but the failure and the screw-up. The anger I could deal with and handle. It was the disappointment in her eyes that was cutting me to the bone.

""How could you trust him again so easily after what happened in New York with him?"" Piper asked me quietly.

""Because I care about him and people change.""

""People don't change that much, Phoebe,"" Prue cut in again.

<i>I will not cry. I will not cry.</i>

""Why not?  <i>I</i> changed!  Do you remember what you thought of me even a few months ago? Do you remember how less than thrilled you were to see me again and have me back at home?"" Oh I did.  She hadn't wanted me anywhere in the vicinity and when she found out I was home... well there wasn't exactly a celebration.

""That's different,"" Prue said.  ""You're my sister and I've seen what you're capable of.""

I really didn't have much of an answer for that.  I didn't know if it was an insult or a backhanded compliment.

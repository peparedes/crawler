"event","hiked like hella to get to this internet cafe! i emailed a very select group of friends, so sorry to everyone who didnt get one. im staying in a village that is seriously more rural than most of you have ever imagined. me and my partner kayla are teaching classes to 45 little honduran kids, 4 days a week. all in spanish. thaaats right, bitches. its amazing here. too bad the food is terrible. but today we hiked into another town to go to this marketplace that happens twice a month. bought soo much fruit for wayyy less than a dollar. oh yes. anywho, this is way to crazy to explain in one little lj entry, so ill just stop trying. basically my summer is awesome, and all you idiots are doing is sitting around, getting drunk and getting fat! 

sincerely suck it,
jean"

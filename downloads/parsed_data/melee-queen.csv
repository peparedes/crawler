"event","It is nice to be back at school! <strike>Kind of.</strike> I am looking forward to working at the Magical Research Institute again this year. Hopefully I can help a bit more with research. 

But right now, I am having trouble falling asleep. It is more like the third of September already...I was up and went out to talk to Zelos. 

Earlier on today, I ran into Lloyd. Him and I went training a bit so that I could show him a summon. For a first year, he is pretty strong; he took a gray wolf out with one strike. <strike>He is really nice...</strike>

Okay, now I am tired, thank god!"

Well I hope it goes fast and I mean really fast, I'm talking as in fast as in fast as summer vacation went by. I don't even know if that last sentence made sense. Well I have to get going.^_^ bubbi!"

Yes.... the girls that were urging me plus one more. AHHH! I think I'm gonna die if they... I'm not even going to finish that sentence.LOL! Well.... anyways enought about that. I was working on my fanfiction story or stories and well... they aren't that good. But I was fixing one, then typing another one but got kind of far then deleted it then again and again because It would be too long plus after awhile it would be all my chapters together. LOL. It is really fun to do fanfiction though. I have to admit that. I have some ideas what to do for my fanfiction. So the one me and my friend worked on is going ok.The one me and my friend did is mine to begin with. She just helped me and got me started.The one I am doing on my own is going well bad.O well.....*sigh*.Timberwolves are winning right now. A lot is going on right now and life is chaos. Also I'm sick and tired. I went to sleep late last night because I kept coughing and it kept me up all night. Well my brother seems to be pissed off. LOL. That's his prblem not mine. There is sooo many things that I want to buy. Like I want to buy another anime dvd. I'm saving up to buy the new manga friuts basket(furuba) that is coming out in June. Also I have to save some money for my yellowstone trip in June to earn high school credits. AHHH! I'm not very good at handling money. When I have money I like to spend it not save it.LOL!

I just wanna yell at all the people here and just tell them to go back home! I just want to have my peace and quiet I want!!!! Maybe I just go on my roof and just sit there and think things over! I think that sounds good right now! But I'm not going to, even though it wounds really good. Peace and quiet I wish there were really such a  thing as peace and quiet. Except I don't think that will happen very often now that Matt(my brother) always has freaking people over! They are making fun off all the people on the tramp.

"event","Hi! what's up. well.. I'm new with this stuff so yea. It may take me awhile to replay so I hope you will have some patience with me. Yes, well.... high school..... I don't even want to think about it because I'm so nervous. School is as boring as ever (same as always). All this stuff is all random that is why the subject is called randomness! Lol. You all probably think I'm some mad crazy person but I'm not(or at least I think that). Yea.... so. 

Did you know that there are to many red and silver cars in this world it's CRAZY! With my friend I looked in her eyes from the side and said, ""Have you been eating glazed doughnuts?"" 

She said, "" HOW DO YOU KNOW?""

Me: ""Your eyes are glazed.""
Oh that was great. Lmao we are insane mofos! O well.... All around it's still good. ^_^"

"event","Have you ever realized that you've become something your not, and don't like how you are, only to find out that you're too late, and you've lost the people that mattered most to you?  Have you ever awaken from a nightmare and realize that your nightmare was better than reality?  Even though I did not sleep last night, when I got in the shower I felt like I awoke from a nightmare.  Unfortunately my nightmares have become reality.  Have you ever thought you knew what was best, and were so frustrated and mad that you made a disition that you thought you had to make, only to later realize that none of the stuff that made everything horrible, didn't matter anymore?  I'm in this crazy limbo that Keney and I have always seemed to be in, between loveing eachother and thinking it best we're not together, at least right now.  It's so frustrating, but the worst part is, it's all because of me.  I've become poisoned with lies that I've told myself, and I was foolish enough to believe them.  Now I'm angry and sad with myself for lieing to myself, and have no idea what to do.  All I can do I give everything over, just trust that God will show me what's best for me.  

I've never loved like this.  I've never wanted so much to just throw everything down and scream I'm sorry.  I've never felt unworthy of forgivness, and desire it so much than I do now.  I pray so much that Keney will not get lost in the army again.  Tonight he's going to the armery to talk again, and I'm afraid that he's going to sign up to be shiped out.  The worst part is, that I've pushed him in that direction.  I've pushed away two people that mattered so much to me, and I am left with a feeling of emptyness.  I know that I'll be spending the rest of my life trying to make it up to them, in hopes that they wont leave completely.  I don't know what I would do if I lost either one of them.  

Today my dad is picking me up at one to go to the district super attendant to tell about what happened to me.  I feel overwhelmed!  Do you realize how hard it was to finaly tell someone, then was pressured into telling my parents, and now my dad is off telling everyone and now I have to go do this!  I just don't know if I'm ready or not.  I feel so sick, my nervs are all over the place.  All I want is for him to hold me, to tell me everything's going to be ok, to tell me he loves me, but I know that I deserve none of it, and I know that he couldn't possibly want to be close to me the way I've been lately.  All I can do is pray."

"event","You offered me drink, 
I wanted more than a sip
I couldn't let go of the straws 
I was clinging to
I'm giving it over, giving it over, to you

I was flat on my back, I'd slid 'til it hurt 
You put my head in the clouds 
And my feet in good dirt
Tainted thoughts were crowding my head
With lies and distractions that spread
They would convince me of 
What fools know isn't true
Quick as an Outkast rhyme 
You took me back in time
Back to the first love I ever knew
I'm giving it over, giving it over to you
 
Got my broken heart healed 
And removed from its cast
I'm giving it over, giving it over to you
Yeah, I'm giving myself to 
A true love at last
I'm giving it over to you at last
You don't know where 
This wind's gonna blow
And since you can't take it with you 
better give it away before you go
Yeah, I'm giving it over, giving it over to you

Greed is the word, it's a verb
Wants to bind us all
Bind us together like a platinum truss 
I'm putting my heart into treasures 
that don't rust
I'm giving it all over to a face I can trust
You don't know where 
the wind's gonna blow
And since you can't take it with you 
Better give it away before you go
Yeah, I'm giving it over, giving it over to you"

I was looking for a poem aimee wrote about putting my love in treasure that last.  Because from now on I'm only going to love the one that I know will always love me back, God.

"event","Faith.

allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY  : fidelity to one's promises : sincerity of intentions : belief and trust in and loyalty to God : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion  : firm belief in something for which there is no proof : complete trust
: something that is believed especially with strong conviction; especially : a system of religious beliefs

What does this mean to us?

Everyone has their own definition of faith.  Some it is strickly religious toward God, while others it may be in people.  I started really thinking about this the past few days.  I believe that it is my devotion of faith to God that makes it easy for me to forgive and trust people.  I'm one of those that will believe you are innocent until proven guilty.  Why is it that I'm talking about this now?  I'm not quite sure.  

What is it to have complete faith?

I may not have all the facts about God, I know I'll never know everything that I would want to, but to me the facts aren't what are important in life.  I have faith in God because I can feel him, I know when he's there, He helps me everyday giving me strength.  When times of trouble come He's always supporting me and always there comforting me.  God's never given me a reason not to believe in Him.  In the same way, I have faith in Keney.  He's never given me a reason not to trust him or to believe that he would lie to me.  The important thing isn't the facts but the outcome, the description, the way it shapes you.  Ken is back, I have the old Keney back!  

With all the happiness I have, hearing his laugh again, talking normaly again, his presence, it all brings joy.  But then why is there still something that saddens me?  *sigh*  I know what it is, I'm just hesitant to write it, which is prolly a good sign that I myself am not ready.  I hate jealousy!  I mean I have no problem with them being friends.  But the things that she says, I don't know what to believe and then how she looks at him, looks at me, talks to me and acts.  It's like she things she has him in the palm of her hand.  I think it's just a burdon on me more than anything.  It's not really anything else now that I think about it.  It's just that once again I have to live in secret, I have to hide something from a lot of people.  I totally understand why, and I feel the same way in some ways, but then I don't

I was watching spiderman 2 today, and it's funny whenever I watch it I get a different quote from it that applys to what is going on with me.  It was when they asked if he had a girlfriend and he said he didn't really know.  ""Love should never be a secret. If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside, it could make you sick.""  Wow, if I've ever been able to relate to something in a movie, that would be it.

I'm just going to try and have fun, and just try and be myself.  I'm not going to hide anything from anyone any longer."

What do I really want for christmas...?  That song has been stuck in my head for a while.  <i>I don't want a lot for christmas, there's just one thing I need, I don't care about the presents, underneith the christmas tree.  I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know.  Make my wish come true, all I want for christmas is...you!</i>  lol... ^_^  Last time I was on break I became obsessed with finishing this puzzle, a big puzzle.  And the picture was of a basket, a woven basket.  Oh, but there were these four small holes in the basket that little kitties looked out of.  It was a hard puzzle, and I finished it!  With the help of phillip of course, and that puzzle brought phil and I back together, even though we aren't now.  

This year I would like to hang out more with friends and go do stuff, but I don't really have much by transportation nor cash, this sucks!  Oh wells...wow it's been forever sense I've just randomly wrote stuff, I feel pretty good...teehee.

"event","I met you when we were both carrying bagage.  Somehow we fit together as two peices to this puzzel we call life.  We've both made mistakes in our past, we started new then again our world came crashing down, when will it be ok for us to be together agian?  So many nights I spent there by your side...watching you sleep, listening to your heart beat, how I just want you to hold me.  Your smell captivates me and sends me to a dream world of happiness.  I don't know how to feel, please take me back to those simple nights, walking undernith the stars.
<i>
On this night of a thousand stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore

In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me
</i>
Runing away from our fears, makeing only things worse, never again.  Still I think of those times together where we found intimacy.  A closeness grew between us and emotions that weren't predicted.  Within us our feelings are hidden, and for some reason they seem to grow there.  Being alone we can't help our actions, attractions pull us closer and closer and our love longs to be fulfilled.
<i>
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason that I caught your eye
Which has to imply, I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
</i>
Unable to show the world of our love and only hopeing that the future will bring ease upon our hearts, we wait.
<i>
 So what happens now?
 Another suitcase in another hall
 So what happens now?
 Take your picture off another wall
 Where am I going to?
 You'll get by, you always have before
 Where am I going to?

"event","I just want to get away, I need to get away!  I can't take him anymore, I can't take his bulling and his painful presence.  There's so many hurtful things that he says and does that I can't even say one without going into another then getting lost in my words and feeling faint.  I just want to disapear, I want to vanish from here.  This pain is too much, I can't carry it anymore, and I don't know how to put it down.  I've tried so hard to, but all it does is draging behind me as I try to walk.  I have so much to say, I can't say anything at all.  

F*ck man...I'm listening to him right now arguing with my mom, and she can't win.  He's backing her into a corner like aways, and we're feeling the same way.  She feels the same pain and stress as I do!  She said to me just last week that she feels like she should commit herself because she's going crazy with all the stress and stuff.  I was talking with Rita just yesterday about all this and she told me that if my mom and I ever needed to get away we could go to her house, she said she was totaly serious about that.  She understands how my dad is, but we all know nothing of what to do.  I don't understand, I might sound unhuman by saying this, but I really believe that he was saposed to die when he had his heart attack when I was in like fifth grade.  Ever sense then, I've wanted to die.  There were so many nights I cried myself to sleep praying that I wouldn't wake up.  I want to end this suffering, I have no more energy to fight, and no more will to press on.  So where am I?  I'm stoped, stuck in the middle of a desert...to die with all my memories."

Nobody heard her, as she cryed,
But still she lay moaning:
I was farther out than you thought
And not waving but drowning

She was calling out for someone
Why didn't anyone hear
To cold for her heart to survive
From her eyes came out tears

Oh, no it was too cold always
Still the dead one lay moaning:
I was too far out all my life
And not waving but drowning"

Emblazoning my mind.

Through the torture and the thunder,
Will imprison me to insure my own destruction."

"event","I feel like a horrible person, but I can't help it.  I think terrible thoughts, but I can't help it.  Every time I try and ignore it, get over it, let it go, it happens all over agian.  I feel so traped and I just want to excape!  I can't live like this, with him breathing down my neck, waiting for me to mess up so he can scream.  I can't help but think how much better things would have been if he wouldn't of survived.  I always wish that he didn't, he shouldn't of.  My father should've died when I was in fifth grade, when he had his heart attack.

Every night I go to bed hopeing I don't wake up.  Thinking it would be better in hell than on this earth.  Yeah I have joys, but when everyday I come home to see him bulling me, it takes away most of them and only the really strong ones will make it through.  I would rather be living on the streets than at my house.  Everyday I cry with such pain that I gag and sometimes through up. 

I'm going to e mail Jacob to see if I can talk to him, before I reach my breaking point."

Are running slow and running late.

"event","I've become consumed with the things that you do or say that upset me and make me sad. I accepted them and tried to forget them and kept pushing you toward fixing them.  As time continued, the more I thought about them the more they began to escalate.  I would always doubt myself, thinking I was in the wrong.  I would always give you more time and more opportunities.

Some days are just going to be bad and we're going to have our times of difficulties, so I tried to let those times go.  Things that you said to me that were loving became fewer and fewer and even the sound of your voice in conversation has become scarce.  The reasons that were keeping us together are slipping from my view.

""What remains of me are shades that I once knew.""

Now things are a little bit harder, now that I'm a little bet smarter than before, I'm not just going to let you fade away, but now we're a little bet farther apart.

I wonder sometimes why I was so forgiving, why I was so incomplete, and why was your touch so important, necessary, true and real to me?  Maybe it was more about my loneliness, wanting to quickly  forget and let go of everything so I could be in your arms again.  I didn't want to come up with this conclusion, I want everything to be wonderful between us.  I tried so hard to be perfect for you, not knowing who you were and wanted.  Now past compromise some things need to be figured out and fixed.  I want to know what you're really about and what you think a relationship is.

Because right now I see a friendship that goes too far, and one person wanting one things and the other another.  What do you really feel...?  What do you want in your life right now?  I'm off balance!  You were the essence I held myself upon and with the concern of you, I've lost myself.

please...
      wont you come find me?"

Now a little bit harder and a little bit smarter and a little but farther from you. But why was I so forgiving? Why was I so incomplete? Why was your touch so true to me?

I watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless Mind again, and it ment so much more and I got so much more out of it then when I first watched it.  It's touched me in a way that I cannot explain!  Quotes like the one above and emotions attracted from it, were incredible.  Actually it was the only movie that i've liked with Jim Carry having a serious roll, he played it so well.

"event","Phillip called me last night and he was with brady.  As usual Brady was trying to get a whole bunch of girls together to go bowling, well at least one, kelli.  From what Phil told me before she's ""hot"".  I feel asleep last night so fast, knowing that when he called he would wake me up.  I had a really bad dream...I woke up to my phone vibrating...at 5:45am, my alarm.  He never called.

I called him, he said he was at Brady's.
""what did you do last night?"" 
""we talked.""
""I thought you were going bowling""
""..Yeah, we bowled a little, then we went to kelli's.""
""why didn't you call me.""
""I'm sorry, but we didn't leave till 3 and didn't get home till 4am.""
Then I asked if stuff went on and he said no, but through all this I had this gut weird feeling, and it felt like he stombled a little.  I have chosen to trust him, what else would I do?  But I still feel like I want to cry? why?  I feel some jealousy because even if nothing happened, he was up till 3am talking to a ""hot"" girl.  Do you do that?  Do you go to a girls house till way eierly in the morning with a friend when you have a girlfriend?  Am I over reacting?  I don't know what to think...

I trust him, because without trust there's no love, so I'm trying to put it over me, but something hits me in my gut.  I feel like I'm losing him for some reason.  Maybe I should just trust him never question and just be happy, but that's what I do to everyone else, I want him to see the real me.  But I don't like the real me, and I don't think he would love the real me.  I feel like he thinks that he's more mature than me, and I'm scared that he feels like I'm acting babyish.  But I feel like I'm acting my age, at least.  *sigh*

I want to be his all, I want to be everything he wants.  I want to be...*perfect*  I feel like I'm all over the place.  I'm going through this really rough time in my life with my emotions and how they effect me.  I've been either really high, or really low, and it really sucks when my dad's home because he messes these up even more.  

I just want to stop feeling pain.  So...I'm going to stop!  When ever I feel it, I'm going to evaluate wether it's something I can control or not.  I'm not going to feel pain on this anymore, or think about this ever again.  I'm just going to forget about the things that cause me pain.  Why dwel on them.  I think I made myself do that because it helped me write, draw, ...it helped me grow stronger and fuled me to move on.  But now it's lagging me behind, so I'm just going to be happy, and someday I'll feel as happy as I show."

I don't even know who I am anymore, I've been trying so hard to make other people happy, I don't know what makes me happy anymore!?!  Do you know what that feels like?... not knowing who you are, what you like, what you're capeable of!  I just want to be happy again, to be carefree, to not have to worry about something when I go out with friends or when I'm trying to relax or go to sleep be constantly thinking about everything that I have to do.  I have headachs everyday now, I always feel dizzy, and I'm so exhusted all the time.  I feel like the world has come crashing down on me.  My chest hurts so bad, I feel so...empty.  

I don't know how to take all this pressure and how to deal with it.  Please!!! Someone tell me, help me, I want to be free!

I called Phillip and his to try and calm down, and then his dad said he went to evans.  Evans!  Earlier he was just telling me what a bad day he was having and he was going home.  I know that when I asked him if he smoked he's going to say no, and he might be upset if he hears my message telling him how I worry and stuff and don't like him going over there, and I don't know what that will do.  And when he tells me this, I'll say ok, but inside my heart will be doubting him and I know it's breaking right now worring.  I love him so much, and I care so much for him, and I want the best for him.  I want to believe him, to trust him when he tells me he wasn't smoking, but the last time I did that he was lieing.

*sigh*

I want to give up job's daughters, my life would be half as complicating, and that would be a lot!  But I can't, there's just no way, without the bethel going down.  I'm to exhusted to think any more.  I'm just going to go read grendal and then go crazy looking for my chem work."

I went to water world today!  We finaly got in around one o'clock because we were running around to try to find a deal for the tickets because they're $30 each.  We went straight for the dinosoar ride, one of the best.  Well at that time I had nothing to eat or dring sense lunch the day before.  We were like third to go after waiting for about an hour and I started feeling sick an dizzy.  I told phil that after this I <i>needed</i> to get some food and water.  About 20 seconds after that I griped onto him and told him that I was passing out.  I started feeling faint and I began to black out, and then boom, I think my head hit his shoulder.  Him keeping me up and hearing his voice kept me awake and the next time I opened my eyes and could see there were like ten people standing around me and three life gaurds were asking me questions and getting me water.  I felt really bad, and phil and I never got to ride that ride.  Andrea, phil's sister, thought he was kiding when he said ""Andrea, Aly's passing out."" .... ""Andrea, we need to get out of this line...<i>now</i>"".  Then she saw me and Eddie, Andrea's sig. other, helped me away.  It's never been that bad before, but the funny thing is when phil and the life gaurd were walking me up so they could refill my water and let me go get food one of my old friends Mike, came over.  He was in ROTC when I was a freshman, and that was the last time that this happened to me.  I didn't say anything to him, because I couldn't find my voice, so he walked away.  I hope he's not mad at me, but yeah, I thought it was funny.  

Water world has some new rides, Storm, is one of them.  It was so awsome, it was pitch black most of the time, so you didn't see which way you were turning and it felt like you were going to tip over so many times.  It was AWSOME!  Then there's this other one called the Revolution.  You turn and slide down for a while, and then to a realy dramatic drop and then spin around in this big bowl like a tolit and thing go through this tunnal in the middle, droping durastically again and going through a waterfall.  this was in a square tube able to fit four people.

It was fun, but then when I came home I had to deal with this infection and my dad giving me a hard time because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't eat much.  My day would have been great if phillip and I weren't so tired, at least I hope that's what was wrong.  He hardly smiles anymore and he doesn't show much affection towards me anymore unless were alone.  I just want him to hold me, and tell me, ""I love you."""

"event","I went to talk to Matt just an hour ago because I can't stand it when someone's mad at me, I had to go to make peace.  We talked a little, not anything really in particular.  I felt like I wanted to burst into tears and all I could do to stop it was bite my lip or smile.  Tonight was the last time we'll ever talk or see eachother again.  That's what he told me, and I believe him.  I could tell by his body language that he still liked me, and he wanted it to not be this way so badly.  He tells me that he'll never get over me, and every time we talk or see eachother...  I loved talking with him, I liked hanging out with him, but I knew that there would always be this tention because I knew he liked me, and he knew that he couldn't have me.  I hate myself right now, I hurt him so badly, I wish I could take it away, but I can't.  As we were saying goodbye, I couldn't read him, for the first time I didn't know what he was thinking, and I didn't know what to expect.  I didn't want to say goodnight, knowing it would be the last time I saw or heard from him.  He's been such a good friend, I don't want to lose that.  It hurts so much... to know that I caused him pain...I just want to make people happy.  There's so much I wanted to say to him, but I knew I couldn't and I didn't have a lot of time either.  I just hope that he finds someone else, and will be happy again.  I'm so tempted haveing his number and knowing where he lives and works to contact him.  There's so much I want to say to him, but I know that even if I had the chance, I wouldn't say it anyway.  He's a great guy, and he has a lot of potential in life.  I just feel like...I just don't want to be out of his life, I feel like I could give him so much...  but he doesn't want what I'm willing to give, and I'm not willing to give what he wants.  I just think from now on, I'm not going to make any friends with guys anymore, except for the ones I already have.  I guess I just feel really bad...and I should.

I'm going to miss him! I'm always going to be looking around when I go out, I'm always going to be anxious when my phone starts ringing, eventhough I know he wont call.  I know I'll go to bed thinking about it tonight, and then forget.  Then when school starts I'll see his car and I'll be sad, and always be looking over my shoulder to see if I can see him in the hallways.  Even if I do, which mostlikely wont happen, I'll end up hiding somewhere and then watch him till he goes out of view.  Because if he saw me I'm sure he wouldn't make eye contact or say hi anyway.

"event","Everything seems to be going wrong lately that could go wrong.  I just want my life to be simple, but whenever one thing is solved something else comes in to ruin it.  My dad has been horrible to my mom and I for as long as I can remember, and it's starting to really effect us.  He just sits around all the time, complains and bitches about everything, and yet does nothing himself.  Then he goes selfish and becomes a drama queen by wining how nobody loves him and treats <i>him</i> bad!  He's made my mom feel miserable and now she's become cranky and agitated because she's tired all the time, works hard, comes home late from work and still has to cook and clean.  Then she has to put up with my dad wining how we're always eating late while he's sitting there watching TV!  I know this may sound cold hearted, and most of you wont understand because you haven't lived with him, but so many times I wished that he would have died when he had his heart attack when I was in 5th grade.  Things would have been so much better, with just my mom and I, our credit would be better, we would of had more money, and maybe we wouldn't be so nasty like we are now.  

I just want to get away from here, but I don't know how to take care of myself.  Maybe that's why I want to go into the army so much, they would take care of me then.  They would tell me what to do, and show me how to do it.  I've never been in really bad situations, I've never had to make desitions for myself.  Ever sense I was little my dad has always found somthing to yell at be for.  I still remember the words he would use and how I cryed so many nights just wishing that I wouldn't wake up in the morning!  He would tell me that I'm...I'm worthless and will never amount to anything.  He would cuss me out and no matter what I did he would always be disapointed about something. <b> I'm sorry I'm not perfect!!!</b>  Then in front of other people he would always act like he's this great person and that he loved me.  He would brag about me to other people because he wanted them to think he was proud of me and that he had a great daughter, when he really thought none of that.  I feel like I'm nothing to him but something he needs to brag about.  That's why I stoped caring about my grades, because without that, he would have nothing to brag about, then he just gave up and dissowned me.  

I have these bad moments sometimes, when I get this glare in my eyes and I become quite.  It's that look he has hunting me, it's those words replaying in the back of my head over and over.  The thing I hate most of all about this is, I hate talking about it, I never want to talk to people about things that bother me because I know other people have real problems and I feel selfish.  I don't want people thinking I want pitty or attention, I don't want that at all...  I just want these feelings to go away!  I want to accomplish something in my life..<i>for me</i>.  That everyone can be pround to say that they know me.  I just want to be wanted...all my life I've grown up believeing that I was unwanted by my family except for my mom, but now, I think thats gone too.  

I know I don't write in my journal offten, I've been really busy, and I only usualy write when I'm depressed, and I'm just so tired right now.  So many nights I go to sleep, hopeing that I don't wake up."

"event","I know I haven't written in my journal lately, quite frankly I've been more than busy!  So much has been going on in my life and I can't even begin to write it all.  I guess it's always the depressing things that bring me to write.  Maybe that's why I've been so built up inside and felt so heavy, because all my woes have dwelled in me and I haven't written about them.  

I love Phillip so much; he means the world to me.  He said something last night that made me the happiest I've ever been.  Evan called him and told him he bought an ounce and asked him to go smoke it with him.  And Phillip replied, ""Sorry man, I found God.""  I was so happy I just wanted to cry.  That meant so much to me and was worth all the heart ach of his past problems.  That mission trip I took with the church was awesome, but I'll have to write about that in another entry because that isn't what this is about.  I've been disappointed lately because we've been so busy that we couldn't see each other, and whenever it seemed like he could go out, he would always go out with his friends instead.  I mean think that we should hang out with friends, and I don't care about that, it's the fact that he always cancels on my at last minute and then goes out with his friends instead.  I texted him saying, ""I don't believe you anymore.  Some things you don't just say with words.""  He tells me that he loves me and that he doesn't want to lose me, but he sure isn't acting like it.  I mean, I believe that he can be a different person, and I believe that he loves me somewhere deep inside him and wants to see me.  However, I feel like he's pushing me away...just like last time. *tear*  I'm not obsessive and I'm not controlling, is it so hard to just talk to me and come and spend some time with me?  I don't even feel like I'm his girlfriend, he always brings my hopes up and makes me believe that he'll be there, and then doesn't show up.  That disappointment hurts so much and I feel like my heart is empty, it's pumping out blood, but not it's not circling around.  

All I want is for him to be there!  Every girl wants that romantic stuff, but I don't care, I put that foolishness aside and just ask for his <i>presence</i>, I never asked for anything more.  Like they said at youthworks, ""your presence can change a life...""  A lack of it can also, please...Phil; I just want you to show up.

I'll be waiting, just as always...no matter how long it takes, I always have faith you'll come."

Waiting on a shooting star

And ice cream castles in the air

They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done

The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh but now old friends they're acting strange
And they shake their heads
And they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
It's life's illusions I recall

"event","This markes one of the worse days of my junior year!  Today started out normal, the only thing different is that Joy and I talked, and we seemed to get along.  I have high hopes there, but I might get the rug pulled out from under my feet because of one stupid thing I said at lunch.  I don't know how it was brought up or what we were talking about but before thinking and stoping myself I said ""I don't think I could ever marry a Catholic.""  I must be the stupidest person alive, it's not that I hate them, it's not that I don't like them, have anything against them.  I have many friends that are catholic and some I have been attracted to in the past.  I just wasn't thinking, I was in one of those free feeling moods like when I'm with aimee because I caught Eric in the hallway and I got to spend lunch with them.  I feel horrible and I wish I could take it back, Eric got really affended, and he's not catholic, but his parents were/are I don't know and his grandfather was catholic.  Right there, you don't say anything about anything bad towards anything related to his grandfather, he is way protective of him.  

Anyways, after seventh I say hi to Matt and the first thing he says is, ""So you wouldn't marry a catholic person!?!""  Oh man...""Eric said that out of no where in ROTC.""  Right then if Eric was there I think I might of smacked him.  From the way Matt talked it seemed like I had something against them.  Like I was a natzie and I was killing a jew.  I dug myself in a whole I admit that I was wrong, and that you can't talk about religion with people because they'll hate you for it.  But for Eric to just go around telling people that I said that, it just really pisses me off.   I came home and I just wanted to cry!

Well it's not like I have tons of friends at kennedy and that that school is my life.  I'm just going to not say anything the rest of the year unless it something in class to the teacher or a close friend. I just wish that Eric would tell me that he hates me and doesn't want to be my friend, at least then I could leave him alone.  I was so happy that one day when Aimee came to school and he was talking to me and just made me feel like he at least knew I was there, not just when he needed something.  Now it's back to usual, the only time we talk is when I go over to him and ask about a class or something.  Eric used to be someone I trusted and loved, he was my brother.  I guess you could say he's really being a brother, because I'm mad at him.

I thought of this title from Quan's shirt, it read, ""hot as fcuk"" I guess it just came to mind."

"event","So I'm going for two.  Paris and Nicole.  Those two bimbos deserve a good slapping, and probably a good spanking too while we're at it.  I mean seriously.  Come <i>on</i>.  They have everything - looks, money, looks, more money, a TV show - and what do they do?  They have a freaking fight and declare war on each other!  What the hell is wrong with those two?  All that shit they have going for them, down the crapper because of some petty freaking fight.

Talk about cats.  Me-<i>ow</i>, anyone?  

The whole thing really just makes me sick.  The worst part is that I give enough of a damn about this to <i>be</i> sickened by it.  I worked for an organization that dedicated itself to helping people, those less fortunate, those whose lives were <i>really</i> turned inside-out and upside-down - and I am completely engrossed in this goddamn fight of theirs, wondering what it means for the future of <i>The Simple Life</i>.  What the hell is wrong with <i>them?</i>  Nuh uh.  What the hell is wrong with <i>me</i>, more like it.  Maybe <i>I'm</i> the one who needs fish-slapping.

It's just disgusting, and I can't believe how jealous of them I am.  <i>I</i> could have been either one of them.  <i>I</i> could have done what they have, what they're doing.  <i>I</i> have an appreciation for the finer things in life.  Don't see anyone offering <i>me</i> my own show.  No, I just have to slut myself out for the sake of the team, and what reward do I get?

Hey Kyle?  Yeah.  I kept that diamond necklace.  Right here, buddy."

"event","I was considering laughing at this question and shrugging it off - is there anyone out there I'd want to trade places with?  I have a pretty good life, I guess.  Or I did, at least.  Not so sure anymore, what with where events lately have taken me - but for a while after joining Team Knight Rider things weren't so bad.  And in case anyone is wondering, forget it - I'm not talking about my ex <i>or</i> my time in prison, capiche?  

So if I could trade places with someone for a day, who would it be?  Took me a while to come up with an answer to this one, I'm tellin' ya.  But... I think I'd have to go for Domino.  Yeah, yeah, I know, she's an AI in a car.  But she's a lot like me in a whole lotta ways.  A lot more so than the AI I somehow ended up getting paired with.  Domino isn't actually too bad.  She likes to flirt, she's sexy and shiny red with nice lines, she likes to get Jenny's goat, she can go fast, she's a convertible - really, what's not to like, right?  Might be fun to be a car for a day, get that unique perspective thing going on.  I mean, I've already got the sexiness and the nice lines thing, and I can wear a red dress, but I can't quite fathom the whole what it's like to be a car deal, and that might be sorta fun.  Mustangs are fun to drive, why not fun to be?  Really, the only drawback to this plan that I can see is the fact that I'd have to put up with Jenny all day.  Still... I wonder what sorts of things she confides in Domino... interesting...

Yeah.  Domino it is.  I wanna be a car for a day."

"event","Oh, I'm dissatisfied with a lot of things in my life.  Want a list?  Where do I start?  Kat, she's one.  She puts serious limits on any fun I may want to have.  Yeah, thanks, mom.  I'll be sure to check in and be home by midnight, 'kay?  *rolls eyes*

*grows thoughtful*

I think the thing that disappoints me more than anything though is Kyle, and his acceptance that Trek was gone.  We looked for him for a while, off and on as time allowed, and yeah, we all got pretty defeated.  One of our own had been abducted and we, Team Knight Rider, couldn't find a trace of him.  I mean yeah, Trek could be an annoying little pissant, and his room smelled like a compost heap!  I swear to god his clothes were <i>fermenting</i> in there - but... he was <i>our</i> Trek.  One of ours, one of the Team.  We owed him that.  We owed it to him to keep looking, no matter what.  Even <i>if</i> the official investigation had ended.  *shrugs her shoulders*  We did, for a while.  And then one day it came through the channels that some higher-ups knew what we were doing, and wouldn't condone the expenditure of any more of the Team's resources looking for someone that obviously was not going to be found.  Trek's a millionaire, did I mention that?  *shakes her head*  In this whole time not one penny was ever spent from any of his accounts.  So of course that <i>proved</i> he was dead.  'Course.  And then Kyle just sat there and had the nerve to turn around and look at us and say something like, ""well that's that"" and that was just the end of it, no more searching for Trek, our <i>friend</i>.  I tried to talk sense into him - Kyle's the Team leader after all - and in that fucking oh so calm voice of his he told me that it was high time we all accepted that Trek was gone, we'd done our best, and if the rest of us wanted to continue together as a Team we had to get past it and move on.

*another shrug*  I don't think so.  That's not how I operate.  Took me five years, and I'm sure my ass'll be in a sling for ""borrowing"" Kat if the Team ever finds us again, but it was worth it.

We found him.

"event","""... Bullshit, Trek.  Michael Knight is... practically a myth.  A fairy story.  Okay, yeah, I guess maybe we sorta met him, but personally?  I think the jury's still out on that score.""

Erica looked on Trek with a mixture of fond amusement and clinical concern.  He'd met Michael Knight in a cafe, was it?  And they'd talked over cheesecake, of all things.  And then she'd bet that Michael gave him a ride home in that supercar of his, too.

She brushed some of his non-existent hair away from his eyes.  Short hair on Trek was still among the changes she was trying to get used to.  

""Maybe you should get some sleep, huh?""  Her fingertips trailed lightly from his hairline, down his face to grasp his chin and give his head a small affectionate shake.

Michael Knight.  Yeah.  Right."

"event","It took a long time, and a lot of me wanting to give up, but we finally found him.  Not in the place I would have expected, but I don't know what I was expecting anymore.  A bar isn't that strange, I guess.  I just wish I knew where the hell this bar <i>was</i>.  Kat has no idea, she can't figure out any sort of coordinates.  We're totally frikkin' <i>lost</i>.

But we found Trek.  

He looks really different, though.  Weird.  I mean, don't get me wrong, the boy looks <i>good</i>.  Great in fact.  He got a haircut, he's got muscles that won't quit - Trek has <i>pecs</i>, my god! - he's totally ripped.  But along with the drool-worthy, there's something else.  He's <i>haunted.</i>  Trek was crying.  He was <i>crying</i>.  Scared is one thing, I can deal with scared.  But crying?  Trek?  What's happened to him?

I wanted to find the old Trek, somehow, someway.  I don't know what I was expecting to find, but it wasn't this.

I miss the old Trek."

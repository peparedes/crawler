"event","it's been months since i've posted. with a myspace and a facebook and a twitter (which i deleted with huuuuge enthusiasm) i am overwhelmed by online postings. i hardly find enough time to pee.(true i hold it for hours)(which i know is bad, but whatev. haha) so this may or maynot be my one posting of the year. i hardly doubt anyone reads this anyway. lets see okay. my year in a nutshell. the beginning sucked. i will admitt. i got promoted to store manager at the boardman store. but i couldn't take the drive so i'm back in canton since march. i started off the year still sharing a place with hally. we actually made pretty good room mates but i was excited to move back into a place with karl. Yep we bought a house! we live in Akron and we love it. i'm skipping around alot. okay so back to me.we bought our house in july . it took 5 months becuase we bough a 100,000 dollar home for a little over 50,000. folks! just a quick side note, short sale does not equal the length of time it takes to close on a house. thats for sure! but patience pulled off and we are loving our home. minus a ghost here and there. and even that has been comical at times. but seriously. and not so much at others. hah. also this year my dad moved from south carolina to washington state. so so sad. but his choice to be closer to his mom. i guess that would make her my grandmother. but i've met other grandmothers and well i feel jipped! tim is back from san fran. brian is living on his own with tim.A . hally bought a house as well. emily is in third grade. kaiden is in head start. we have a petting zoo in our house. i got a cha hua hua for emily for xmas. her name is mia. she is beautiful. karl couldn't stand to be patient in the training process and made me find her a home. emily took her. so i know she will be just fine. karl is eternally kissing my ass for making me spend my new years crying. lets see...ohhhh biggest news. i got engaged. our wedding is oct.30th. fun fun details to come! or an elopement. haha lets cross our fingers for elopement. karl wants a wedding i want to just run away. i quit smoking in march. karl quit smoking almost 2 years ago.lots healthier for us and the kiddos. he loses weight eating cookie dough. i dream of smelling cookie dough and not gaining weight(random fact:) xmas was amazing. kaiden and emily got sppppoiled. i got sppoiled and karl got jipped i think. not my fault he went waaaaaaaaayyyy over the limit we set. why set limits? dont ask him.he got me a plane ticket to go home to colorado as an extra suprise gift. i cried. okay i cant talk about myself anymore. love ya bitches. i hope 2009 was all you dreamed!! xoxoxox muuuuaaah"

"event","since i've updated...and i'm gonna lay it all out.:)
doesn't seam like that long. lets see..what i have as far as an update can go. okay..most important..(as ladonya says it in her color purple accent) IZA GETTIN MAAARRRIED. karl asked me to marry him . on his birthday at the resteraunt where we had our very first date. it was cute and the ring is gorgeous ladies. it's a one of a kind. that he had made. he also took part in the crafting of the diamond. so not only is it beautiful but it's very sweet and sentimental. i guess he asked my dad back in december and hally has known since october. she said it was the hardest thing keeping it a secret. especially when i would say things like ""it's never going to happen"". you know how we get. (us girls) :) so now it's just plan plan plan. and i love it. our engagement party is set for june 7th. invitations and all will be sent out probably about 2 weeks in advance. we'll probaby email alot of them. it's just easier. 

We bought a house. it's outside of Akron. Karl was very apprehensive about even looking in Akron. (you know how those jackson boys can be. anything outside of jackson is the ghetto) anyhoo...we are buying and i'm excited. i would like a bigger yard. but the house has alot of potential to be amazing. i like the neighborhood too. its like a cute little highland square. and i know karl would NEVER go for highland square. so we live in highland hills..haha. it's close enough to both our jobs. so we dont have to worry about to far of a commute. which is nice. in this economy your lucky just to have a job. 

oh and shoot me!! i want another baby!. but lucky for us we cant have anymore. but we would have the room now!!
okay so here is some other stuff going on in the future.
may 15,16th and 17th i'm going to indiana and chicago. my freind jamie smith is getting married so i'm going up there for 3 days.
june 6th my daddy will be here from s. carolina
june 7th is my engagement party . 
june 8th he is taking emily ,kaiden and hallys daughter brooklyn for 2 weeks!! oh and 
june 7th through 13th i'm on vacation...oh and i'm roadtrippin it to boston!!
then the storm clears and then on 
july 26th i'm going to colorado for a week!! ten year reunion baby!!
and then it's serious planning on this wedding.
some shows i'm going to 
well besides the fact that our show at the cleveland h.o.b got canceled tonight:(  which means no hypercrush*:( *:( double sad face.
electric six may 8th at the grog.
NKTOB in june.
possibly warped tour. we're debating. because i want to see flogging molly but i have never had all that much fun sweating all day at warped before. and i already saw them in february.

"event","i have no drama in my life right now. which is a good thing. maybe just maybe. i'm finally becoming an adult. trivial little mishaps just aren't that big of a deal anymore. 
last night i called a couple friends to catch up. i've decided that i'm no longer going to persue a friendship with lisa anymore. it's always up and down up and down and hardly back to up. i have to constantly walk on eggshells with her. i love her to death. dont get me wrong. she can be one of the most fabulous ppl i have ever met. but she's an infection sometimes and i no longer want my life to be infectious. i guess since i care to much about certain aspects of her life. and i'm a friend who is not always going to tell you what you want to hear. i'm a lecturer. so apparently thats why she probably dosn't talk to me anymore. so i hung up on her. goodbye. i'm done. chapter closed. for now.
karl kaiden and myself are going to chicago on aug.10th. to pick up emily. i need a vacation. and i really need my jeanette. god how i miss her!
went out with the girls on saturday night for kaylas bday. had a blast. met some cool ppl. didn't care much for the girl that came to breakfast with her cousin joe. a little (very)opinionated for my liking. and damn that girl never shuts up!
all in all. didn't get kicked out of denny's had a blast at on tap. it was a fun night.
karl is good . em is good. kaiden is good. myself fabulous.

"event","EISLEY has a new album coming out AUGUST 14th. i'm sooooo <b>excited</b> i've heard samples of it and it's <b>amazing</b>! 
the only thing that makes me a little sad is that if i want to see them on their first 4 month tour i will have to go to chicago on aug.7th. and i'm already going aug.10th. descisions... <b>discisions</b>...descisions....
i really need to get my hands on a sneak preview of this album. but i will be in the stores on the 14th to buy it. they put so much work and so much emotion into thier writings. they are one of the few bands i can think of right now that are worthy of my 12 dollars. 
i'm super excited that not only is the 14th the day emily comes home but now we will have some sweet music to listen to on the drive home!!!!!!
i'm now in love with august 14th

"event","I had the worst anxiety atack ever today :( i guess the stress of life and all the things that go with it finally caught up with me. i called my dad and he was really worried about me so he sent my sister over. and he was right as usual. having her around really helped me not to focus on myself. sad how hearing other peoples problems can make you feel better.
i had to work today. and for the first time i didn't want to go. not that i didnt' want to go to my job. just that i wasn't motivated to leave the house. but it was good for me. i texted karl and told him it would make my night if he came to see me. and it did. i saw him walk in with his big huge i could rid the world of poverty with my smile and i was ecstatic to see him. yet i was even more thrilled when i looked down by his side and he had brought me the most beautifull arrangement of gerber daisies. regular daisies and roses. sometimes i wonder how i got so lucky. *note to self** ( read this entry later when he pisses you off) hah
Emily's last day of school is thursday. then the following week she leaves for her dads. I cant beleive how fast this year has gone by. and i cant beleive she'll be gone the entire summer. and she'll come back and she'll be a first grader. I HAVE A FIRST GRADER!!...okay now i feel old once again
Kaiden has descided that his new favorite word is SHIT he says it all day long. i try to ignore it hoping that my lack of interest will make him lose interest. but he only says it more. Karl finds it absolutely hilarious and even encourages him. so now karl will be like put OH shit on the phone so i can talk to him. because not only does he say shit . but he loves to say OH SHIT as well . it is funny i'd be lying if i said it wasn't. :) and i'm probably partly responsible because i have a mouth like a drunken whore in a titty bar. so it's really made me take a look at my choice of words when i'm around him. and emily.
well i'm off to spend time with my man. he deserves it . after all i should be greatfull he is patient enough to put up with me and loves me even when i'm psychotic. hahah
oh and i lost 23lbs last month. yeah!!

"event","i'm in this stage right now of my beautifully fucked up chemicalness where i feel alone. i hate when i get in this stage. because no matter who i talk to i still feel like shit. my dad talks to me but he always states the obvious. karl is not sympathetic. all my friends just tell me what i want to hear. lisa is the only person who makes me feel better. she is the only one who gives me the godawfull truth no matter how horrible it is. i can always count on that. i love her for this. 
i'm sure this entry seams a little like one big run on sentance. i'm not even sure that i'm expressing exactly how i feel. 
i feel like my relationship is in the shits. (it's not) i feel like a fat obese cow(i'm not) i feel like i'm not good enough for anyone(so not the case) i feel like i want to run away and never look back(cant because of my kids) this is what it's like for me when my depression kicks in. i start to feel like i'm living on the outside of my life. like no one cares about me. i get sad and depressed. and all i want is to numb these feelings. god i wish i had some vallum or a vic. something something to make me not give a fuck. this is why is started doing drugs in the first place. instantly i didn't feel so alone. and so sad. i felt numb and i didn't give a fuck about the world around me. of course those feelings come back once the drug has escaped the system. but then there is always a back up. alcohol really dosn't do the hole numbing thing for me. but drugs. man i miss drugs right now. dosnt mean i'm going to start doing them again. i've been clean for so long. and i love my babies to much to be a shit head drug addict. but that dosn't mean i'm not alowed to miss them. to miss the feeling of escaping my body without taking a step. 
i would love to pop 2 or 3 750's and lay back and feel my hole body just go limp . giggle when nothings funny but just because i feel so distant from my sadness. almost like an instant fuck the world!! i miss that feeling. i miss X. not for the amazing sex. for the amazing pleasure it brought all over my body. for the way it made me love my entire existance. i miss shrooms because well...well they are fukkin great. 
i'm tired i havn't been getting that much sleep. i'm going to drive up to akron today and go to alladins. and sit in highland square and drink tea and read a book maybe take my laptop. and just be. be by myself. alone me and the mind that races . free of substance. wanting substance. and knowing that in the end i'm stuck with me."

"event","mothers day was great. haha. karl woke me up with a mothers day song he wrote for me. i told him that i didn't want him to buy me anything instead i wanted something from the heart. hahaha so he writes me this mothers day song. i cant even remember the words but it was hilarious.
we had brunch at rani's and then me and sandy went to see the movie Georgia Rule. it was not that it was a bad movie. it was that i really think lindsey lohan is a talentless cracked out whore.
i had 2 outbursts yesterday. i have no idea why. i was just running a rampage screaming my head off. i was pissed at everyone. but they only lasted like 10 mins. and then i was nice amanda again. i really hate the feeling i get when i am so filled with rage. i try to be carefull to yell at everyone but the kids. it takes extra effort. because kids are extra irritating. buttt it's not their fault. they're kids they're supposed to drive you crazy. 
well i know were they stem from. they stem from feeling like i have a gazzilion and one things to do in a short time. everyone is pulling at me from 3434 different directions and i feel like i cant get enough done. 
i need a vacation. for a month
hahha
off to work! i hope everyone has a great day!"

so i'm gonna make a list because i'm not motivated to write about everything. haha so so sad!!
there are really in no paticular order sorry not motivated for that either:)

*drama drama witht the babysitters drunk mother. total cunt. her daughter called me crying about how horrible things are at home and i feel terrible for her. but because her mom is psycho i cant have her over here anymore..i'm not dealing with that crazy shit.

*i kissed to sisters in one night. haha (they know who they are) 2 of the funnest girls i've ever met!!

* me and kayla made 2 road trips to columbus. some would say pointless roadtrips but i had a blast. listening to loud fun corny music. seeing how many semi's we could get to honk. and possibly coming into contact with some of the most fashionably retarded people we've ever seen. columbus natives have some serious closet issues!! hahaha although the mcr concert was canceled twice on us. and eventually they got smart enough and canceled it until further notice . i have lost all faith that they are actually a band and have live shows. haha jk. i hope they dont die and go back to their pampered manions with all their hot hoes and not even worry that they caused broke ppl to spend their money on their lack of eating non contaminated foods!!!!  i hope you get the house in the divorce kayla!!!! we'll sell it for clothes to wardrobe columbus ppl who dress up as lebricons and ride bikes!! hahhahha

* i lost 5 more inches and 6 more lbs. i'm so hungry right now. not because i starve myself...because i'm lacking motivation to eat. i'm exhausted. kaidens been getting me up 7. little adorable shit that one!!

*gavin turned 3..i cant believe how much he's grown in 2 years. i remember when i first met him and me and karl got him tad. and a balloon and he walked around the living room playing with that balloon for hours. awwww...kayla he's precious.

*sorry to everyone who missed the kayla and amanda show. but atleast we show up for our performances!!!

*i'm going to akron idol this week!!  i think steph will win!

*i love love love love love my job! wont say where i work because i dont want to be stalked by some livejournal creapo!

*my sister moved back to ohio!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*i miss timmy so much it hurts. and i think it's a reason i've been suffering from some depresion lately. i used to fix all his problems and now i cant and that makes me miserable and him happier because he's doing things for himself. but whatever i like being a fixer( is that even a word?)haha

*i didn't go to colorado:( everyone canceled on me and besides i didn't really have the money to go. :( i'm homesick!!

*aunt flow is visting .what a fukkin cunt cant wait till that aunt dies!!
oh speaking of dead aunts

*my great aunt died today. but i really didn't know her that well. and i think my grandma is getting a ton of money cause she was awful chipper today. although she really dosn't need it . because she acts like she's so broke because she only has a couple hundred thousand dollars left out of like 2.5 million she got when my useless fukking peace of shit grandpa died. but whatever

*i have to get my teeth cleaned on monday. yay for me!! i love the dentist..NOTTTT!

*mothers day is coming up and all i want is for my kids to let me sleep!!

*ed mcMan lost my address! fukker!!!

*i'm going to sleep

you know as we get older and our lives become more chaotic it's really hard to make as much time as we would like for our friends. we have work and kids and boyfriends, and girlfriends,and family functions and school activities. some of us are working multiple jobs. and even though i may not see some of you on a regular basis the times we spend getting together. having lunch, going shopping, walking in the park, dancing all night and doing shots at the bars. talking out our dingbat boyfriends who we love ,whatever it is we're doing i'm glad that i share those times with you guys!!!
i just felt that in memory of the people who maybe have a friend that is feeling like they didn't get to say goodbye, or maybe they were in some petty arguement at the time, or maybe their lives got so busy they didn't get to see or talk to eachother that much. i would let all of you know that inspite of all those things if i exit this precious existance at any point none of those things would matter and i would want you to know number one ...i aint got nuthin but love for ya!!:)

karl had an episode on sunday ..he was mouthing some shit about the fact that we are in a relationship and that i never come to him to help in making descisions..and blah blah blah..mostly i say that because his mouth was moving but all i heard was wah wah wah wah ...he is hysterical becuase he is always telling me "" i dont care what we do ..you plan it..i'll be there"" or if anyone asks him about something he tells them that he has to check with me first...he has always relied on me to make all the plans..and now what 2 years later ..all of a sudden he wants an opinion..he cracks me up..i love him but he needs a nod in the jugular...haha we are fine he yelled at me i got sad (pretended). and i got quite an amazing foot massage. boys!!! fucking boys!! hahaha
  tomorrow is his birthday and i got him 4 amazing impossible movies to find...he is such an ass..he finds himself so amuzing i find him a pain in my ass..he says"" all i want for our anniversary are these 4 movies..but they are basically impossible to find...jeez thanks...next time i want a gift i'm gonna tell him i want this blue shirt made by i dunno some brand..but it was 2 seasons ago..find it!! 
so anyways i found them because i have skills...but still...
you know this is what i love about the hole gift card thing. you give them money , they buy exactly what they want. and everyone is happy.

"event","yesterday was just retched!!
me and karl couldn't get along to save our lives. i had the conversation from hell from sandy. and then i went to work...and all was well with the world again. who wouldn't love playing with dildo's and vibes all night and talking about sex with perfect strangers!! definetly is an intrusting job to say the least. and the ppl i work with are amazing!!
the night ended well...i came home and karl came outside and talked with me. and apologized for the way he had acted. and apologized for his mom. and said that he had told her she cant talk to me like that. i guess she felt she was to harsh and felt bad but i'm just sick of her shit. 
we came inside and joked and talked and i told him that i wasn't going to stand for some of the things he said to me.(they weren't mean, they were just typical things karl says before he speaks.) and he said he was sorry. and we moved on. no point in continuing to argue over petty things. right? right! 
plus i can never stay mad at him. he has this affect over me. plus when i rolled over this morning to stretch he planted the cutest little kiss on me. it's those little things that get me everytime. 
so today it's work , then i'm picking up gavin. then tonight me and karl are going for martini's at the martini lounge. and to dinner in akron. and then home. 
k off to play with dildo's 
hope everyone has a good day!!!

"event","this morning my heart melted when kaiden started crying and running to karl as he was putting his shoes on..karl hurried up and got them on and picked him up and played with him. and made him laugh. it so sweet the way he is with kaiden. it's just sweet to see guys with thier kids especially when you can see the love they have for them.

since i started my new job i cant really ask for a vacation so i'm postponing my colorado trip:( i'm upset i want to go home so bad..i miss my friends i miss the feeling i get everytime i go home. no place on earth can replace the feeling i get when i go home!  sicne we cant go now my freind jeanette is coming here instead. since i might be going to school in pittsuburgh she's going to go with me and check out the school and we're going to do the hole tourist thing since she's never been there. 

i'm going to take her to see a couple bands while she's here. and i'm not really sure what else. of course take her to highland square. and cleveland. possibly columbus.i'm not quite sure of the hole agenda yet. but i know she is also dissapointed that we're not going. so i have to make it as fun as possible


i'm excited to get out of town for the weekend of karls birthday. we're not disclosing our info to anyone and we're just getting away!!!"

"event","today was a pretty descent day. I miss emily she's with her dad and i miss her terribly!! i went to kareokee last night with my siss...it was fun . the crowd was dull..but of course i rocked it. i got a little drunk and even made some comment about being dissapointed in the song selection because everyone was poisoning my ears with all ""this emo shit"" you know i was drunk..hahah 
so like i said today was good..i woke up at 8 had sex twice before 11. you know its a good morning when you fill every hole before lunch.
we went to luci's for karls family thing today. it was chaotic and crazy as usual. but nice that we only had one child and everyone else had a gazillion. we colored eggs . mine are so much prettier then karls. haha his are so ugly..oh he grabbed one and he scribbled all over it and he said that it was an expression of his anger..haha
amii was there and i didn't say a word to her.
i was serious when i said that i gave up on her. no matter how hard i try i can not seam to help that girl achieve a higher level of common sense and i'm exhausted from trying. when she pissed me off 2 weeks ago i told her i wouldn't be hanging out with her anymore. and seriously i just cant and dont have the energy to teach that girl about things she should have learned by the age of 6.
i'm tired. i wanted to go out but everyone was such a party pooper tonight.
tomorrow is easter at my moms. and it will be nice again to just relax not have to chase kids around and just eat and be peacefull.
i got an early anniversary present today . karl got me some new shirts. and they are uber cute.  i love my job at ambiance.. nothing better then talking about sex allll day!!!!
i hope everyone has a nice easter. filled with lots of chocolate and ham!!! not exactly in that order:)"

"event","I'm going to pick on someone for a moment that i actually dearly like and respect. sorry stephanie.
i know that alot of people think it's no big deal that i get heated over this hole american idol ordeal. and it is i'll admitt nothing really to get worked up all over. but i think it's more to do with common respect for the individuals who are avid watchers. I personally am not the type of person who cares what people think about me . or how i choose to spend my tuesday and wednesday night. what i care about is people who are trying to ruin my evening based on the fact that they think american idol is a popularity contest full of talent lacking individuals who are just using it to break into the music industry the ""easy"" way. There is no easy way to break into the industry no matter which direction you try to take. sure it might open doors for you that weren't so easily accesible. but soo what. who hasn't heard the phrasse ""it's not who you know, it's who you blow"" who hasn't used these tools in your everyday life. such as getting a job because a friend of family member can get you in. or using someones employee discount at a store you shop at. or getting in the movies free because your neighbor is a manager. or getting out of ticket because you have big boobs.  Or getting into a show free because you get to know the band.

life no matter how much you try to fight it. is pretty much one big popularity contest. everyone sometime in their life has based an opinion on someones look. someones atire. someones lifestyle. someones weight. 
i'm no exception. you (everyone) are no exception. 

basically if you dont like american idol and what it stands for TURN THE FUKKIN THE CHANNEL. AND GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!

i'm certainly not going to find something your enjoy and try to ruin it based on the fact that i think it sucks...trust me i could come up with a list of things and entertainers that i find thouroughly annoying and wish would go away!!! i simply just dont go see their movies. watch their t.v shows or  buy their cd's.

thanks for listening to me bitch..even if it dosnt matter"

"event","kaidens not throwing up anymore!! good sign...but he has diareah real bad and i called his dr. today and he's still contagious..which means that i can get sick!! and i swear i'm going to get fired if i dont go to work...karl had to call off yesterday because he was sick..and emily was up all night last night complaining of her stomach hurting and now she has diareah!!! uuughhhhh...i swear ..so there's this girl that offered to watch them..i warned her of the flu going around my house and she said she didn't mind...she wants to stay home from school...i know it's bad but i was just like okay...cause i need to go to work and get out of this house.
it's pretty bad when my dad wont even come over because he's afraid to get sick.
i need a break!! last night i got woken up from kaiden crying because he shit all over his bed all over himself . nothing like waking up at 3 in the morning to diareah all over the place. 
there's a little girl in emilys class who hasn't been to school all week..because she is sick with the same thing. they admitted her into the hospital last night. for dehydration. and emily was playing with her last saturday at a birthday party and the nurse sent a letter home with the kids stating that over 50 kids were absent this week with this flu...GREAT!!!!
you seriously have no idea ...what its like to be constantly thrown up on and constantly shit on. until you have sick kids...and it dosnt last like 24 hours it lasts like a week!! GREAT!
I'M GONNA LOSE MY MIND IF EMILY GETS SICK TOOOOOO
so yeah i'm irritated!!!!
but i'm sure all of you can understand why
and stay away from my kids...they're deadly...hahahaha"

"event","sometimes i get a little depressed because since moving to canal fulton i feel like i've lost touch with some great friends. it's always nice when finally i get to make plans to do something. me and kayla made plans to go to kareokee wednesday night and i told her that she should invite stehphanie and renee.. (these girls are incredibly sweet and incredibly fun). 
first me and kayla descided to get some dinner . we went to the sahara grille . had the buffett and ate until we almost exploded...( with complete delight)..hahahhaaha not as good as alladins..but pretty darn good. at the end of the dinner i spotted this cute candle holder sitting on one of the tables. me being the restraunt klepto that i am totally took it. kayla got a litte adventurous too..she went to the bathroom and grabbed her a little souvineer as well...hahha 
karma totally bit me in the ass because when i got to the car a black sharpee exploded inside my purse...fuck totally learned a lesson there...NO MORE SHARPEES IN MY PURSE haha ...
we headed out to kareokee and to my delight kayla told me that renee and steph were coming!! 
when we got to the red dog we noticed no smoking signs posted outside , we were sadened by this .. but completely uplifted when we walked in and kayla noticed there were ashtrays...they are not enforcing the law yet!! hell yah!
the night started out a little dull the kareokee machine didn't want to work. renee and steph weren't there yet, when the machine did work it was all honky tonk redkneck tone deff people singing. it was rediculous...but then renee came, and the shots apeared and then steph came and the shots apeared then kayla went to the bar and the shots apeared. renee bought me a drink and i think kayla but i'm not sure and the bartender and i bought 3. yah i was lit! we had such a good time. we danced and sang and wow stephanie tore the mic up!!!! she was awesome...
over all it was one of the funnest nights i've had in a really long time!!!! 
so that was wednesday 
thursday was my actual birthday (not even almost as fun as wednesday) i had to work from 11-7 my boss makes me go outside and clean all the pumps!!! what a fukkin bitch right...but i did it . cause i'm a little worker bee the queen shouts and i scramble...fukkin cunt...haha 
i went to dinner with karl and his family and my mom and her bf came...in all there was 23 of us..and everybody wasn't there...god we have a huge family...
dinner was nice and karls family gave me 120 dollars which was so nice. 
me and karl were going to go see the new drew movie..but instead we went and bought borat...we were supposed to do it..and i was suppose to get my gina eaten ...IT'S MY BIRTHDAY...I DESERVE BIRTHDAY GINA!!!
but god we're so old..i was exhausted we put borat in..he was holding me and we passed out within 5 min...i'll probably start my period today...cuase it's just been one of those days...anyhoo..OH we got home around 11:30 my brother was watching the kids...i walk in the door...and the kids are both awake!! i was soooooo LIVID..they are supposed to be asleep at 8:30 and i'm very strict about that. i get them both to bed and i walk downstairs and something is all over my couch. i questioned my brother becuse it looks like mud and he said he has no idea what or where it came from...I'M SO SURE...so i try to wash it out...and it looks like it's gone but i wake up and it looks as if someone splattered vegetable oil all over my furniture...i'm crying and upset and em tells me that ""uncle brian spilled quacamole"" WTF!!! i'm livid i call my dad and he said that he would steam clean it out...well it's almost 5 and he is still not here! 
so it's friday and you might ask ""amanda why are you home on a friday night"" becuase my bitch boss said that i didn't do what she asked me to do...and i totally did and she takes me outside and says that she had to re wash the pumps because i didn't do them right and i said that was false because i totally washed them and i wipe my fingers across them and omg...there was dirt...on a gas pump OUTSIDE..go figure so i said to her ..now...if i washed them last night and you washed them today...then why is there dirt on them? they should be spotless...and she tells me that she is not in the mood for my sarcasm..blah blah blah and basically she said well what are you going to do about these dirty pumps and i told her that i was going home i was tired of her picking on me i was tired of her enbarrasing me in front of customers i was tired of her crap..that she was a fuking bitch and she could take her power trip and shove it up her ass...and i clocked out and left!!!!!
then i thought shit i just quit my job...fuck!!!
but no one deserves to be talked to like that. especially in front of people . in front of customers and thats not the first time she has done that to me...
i called karl and he told me he would have done the same thing and things would be alright . and i already had a job interview lined up for monday. 
so i've had a weird couple of days ...filled with all kinds of excitement..some good and some not so good...
but then i just think i need more nights like wednesday!!!!!
thanks girls
thanks again
xoxoxoxo
oh shittt almost forgot..i'm getting a car tomorrow morning!!!!!! as long as the auction goes well...

"event","a couple days ago amii had asked me to attend an aa meeting with her for a research paper she has to do for sociology. i guess she didn't want to go alone. tonight was the meeting . i have been to an aa meeting before so i knew what to expect but before i was going because i had to attend one after i left rehab. basically they want you to attend meetings that are based on anything substance relaited. anyhoo...before i went i basically had no expectations i ws just going to try and blend in and hopefully not be called out to talk about why i was there...and that did happen..however i felt really guilty for going and prying in on their lives. listening to them pour their hearts out and i'm a big fat liar for being there. i am however an alcoholic i was born an alcoholic. i however refuse to be sucked into the degree that it takes to let alcohol consume my life. i have seen and been around way to many alcoholics to be anything like them.
these woman were so amazing and so supportive of eachother. that i am going back...
after the meeting amii and me went to wal mart. however amii never made it in because fortunate for her i took my meds and didn't knock her fucking lights out. i was talking to karl on the phone. and she was parking and it was cold and windy and i wanted her to park close and she said ""c'mon you can walk some extra steps and lose some poundage"" at first i was in shock and then i said so loudly to her i think i scared her (with karl on the phone) i said who the fuck do you think you are to EVER speak to me like that..if you weren't karls sister i would fucking knock your lights out...just because your a youngblood dosn't mean you can open your goddamn mouth and speak to people however you want. you fucking apologize to me right now. that was so fuckin rude. you discust me...and then i slammed the door and went inside. 
once inside i called her phone and i told her that i was extrememly pissed at her that i couldn't beleive she said that. and i was really pissed off. she said she knew and she would take me home when i was done. i think she got the point i was pissed. 
when i got in the car i looked at her right in the eyes and i said "" i'm going to pretend you never said that. and we're going to pretend that you have common sense and that you speak before you speak"" 
wtf does she not realize i dont take shit. that she is lucky she is karls sister. because i've been seriously dying to knock someone out.
i'm over it now but i know in the future she will think before she speaks. atleast when she is around me:)"

"event","thursday is my 26th birthday and i'm kind of depressed...i feel like i'm getting old and that scares me. there is still so much in my life that i feel that i should have accomplished up to this point. so many people my same age have progressed so much farther at this same stage in their lives and i cant help but be a little envious. my friend jeanette always reminds me of the things i'm lucky to have and then i always remind her of the things she's lucky to have. truth be told, if you combined our lives we'd have the perfect life!!
i have 2 amazing kids..and a great (hopefully one day) step kid. i have karl. we are pretty much perfect for eachother. i have a perfectly functional, disfunctional family. i have great friends.. although sadly enough most of them are spread out on every coast. 
she has a good job in a high end retail store in downtown chicago. she has an amazing body ..so naturally curvy and just perfect. she has a smile tht could brighten a suicidal teens day. it litterally beams from ear to ear. she has the MOST perfect curly hair. so unfair. she comes and goes as she pleases and has no one to answer to .  
so as you see..if you combined our lives...there really wouldn't be any reason to complain...and i defeintly wouldn't feel bad about getting older.. 

my mom took me shopping today at old navy and dropped 250.00 dollars on me..it was fun.. and i filled a cart..NOT on purpose. and i almost felt bad when we were at the register. but all she said is thank god for me your birthday only comes once a year. she knows i've been stressin about my birthday. plus she's been in a good mood everyday it gets closer to her vacation. she getts happier.. i think her vaca being only 2 weeks away totally benefitted me. 

then we went to lunch at don pablos. we had fun and laughed and my mom STOLE me set of steak knives..hahahaha i love my mama...she is a blast!! and i gave my dad my left over food and forgot the knives were in there. and i said dad have you looked in the box yet..and he said no why...and i said cause there are some steak knives i need out of there..and he just started laughing and he said you are so your moms daughter..and i was like i know...and then i said ..she stole them for me and he laughed harder...truth be told she hardly ever leaves a restraunt empty handed...it's kind of fun to come out with new salt and pepper shakers or spoons or glasses...hahahaha 

and the best thing about today is that i'm definetly getting an interview for the job in cleveland. i'm not guranteed the job but i am for sure getting an interview. i'm so excited. but i'm not going to get my hopes up to high . but keep your fingers crossed for me!!!! 

peace out"

"event","i have so many random scattered thoughts right now. and i dont which one i want to start with first. 
okay i'll start with my past creapin up on me today out of nowhere. i kind of knew it was going to happen but i wasn't sure when or how. i was kind of numb to it at first and now it's all i can think about. not that i ever want to revisit that part of my life but because of the fact that i was so numb. i dunno 
moving on.

i hung out with amii all day yesterday. sometimes she frustrates me .only because her sense of humor needs some serious adjustments. but i think we are getting more comfortable with eachother. we went thrifting and we got her a fish and i got emily a water frog and then we came back to my place for a while till karl got home and then me and her went to cleveland to see tim. 
his appartment really looks great. hes got this cute ass new puppy named tilly. and he confirmed that his band will indeed play at kaidens party . so i'm really excited for that. they are going to play some kids songs for the little ones. 
oh i got kaiden a curious george cake . it's half banana and half chocolate with whipped frosting. mmmmm
i dont think anything sounds yummier then banana birthday cake.
i had to call all my family and invite them yesterday. my mom said i should have sent out invitations but i'm not much of a formal planner. it's like okay if you want to come this is where when and why so come if you want
haha
we are going to have face painting for the kids. and live music and good food we are doing this baxter style. haha
hope everyone is having a great beginning of the week. i am because i am not at work"

"event","i had a pretty good weekend..i worked most of it. as usual. i hate working 2-10 it's like your hole day is gone. and that really sucks. i came across a very possible career opportunity last night, in banking. my friend works at a bank in cleveland and he said that he dosn't think he would have any problem getting me a job. if i got this job . we would have to move closer to cleveland.like the fairlawn area. and karl could switch home depots.
It's alot more money. shit carneys make more money then i do.
it's an actual career. i would have to dress up in cute little business suits every day and i would have my own little cubicle ,paid vacation no weekends every holiday even the dumb gay ones and mike was saying last night they give frequent bonus's. the only thing is the next training session dosn't start until may. keep your fingers crosses for me. I need a career so i can transfer to a state where it dosn't snow!!! i need to start making some more money so i can take karl on little trips and show him the country so we can get the hell out of ohio.
Saturday night we went out to thursdays and annabells. Thursdays was really dissapointing which made me really sad becaue i've always been so in love with that place. in a way i know that hanging out with angie is what made that place fun. sometimes i wish that things could have been different. we had alot of fun hanging out. but to many hurtfull things have been said on both ends and it would never feel right to hang out with her again. and the things that bugged me about her then. would still bug me now. but i would be lying if i said that  i didn't miss the going out and having a kickass girls night. I stopped by adams street as well . to see skip. he was so excited to see me and vice versa. if the weather permitts it i'm going to head out there tomorrow night. one because i drink for free..2 because i miss his sexy queer ass. and three because some of the people i worked with at alladins are going to be there and i would really love to see them.
kaiden is turning 1 on friday and i'm having so many emotions about it. I'm proud to see him evolve into this little amaing person, but i'm sad to see him growing up. it's going by way to fast. A  year ALREADY where does the time go? i have to work on his birthday too:( so we'll probably celebrate it early in the week. i need to change the subject before i actually start crying...sad huh? 
i'm suppose to go thrifting with amii tomorrow. i love thrifing. i love junk . i love worn in clothes. precious little cheap finds. i love buying things for my friends that are odd and obviously a thrifty find :)
I cant wait for colorado in may. i really need this vacation. karl really wants to go and i think he feels a little left out. be he totally understands i need some girl time. i actually would love for him to go. i want my friends to meet him. but if he goes then philip will want to go and jeanette is singe and i dont want to make her feel like some sort of multiple wheel. third or forth or whatever. haha
i miss flying i love to fly
why would anyone want to spend hours in a car. when you can get there so much faster by flying and save so much time on your vacation. that you would have spent traveling.
well i've wrote a mini novel 
i hope everyone had a good weekend...oh and the kitties are doing GREAT
we love and adore them and we are so happy to have them in our lives. and i cant wait to get a house so we can get a dog!!!! and probably some more cats becuse my bf is the cat man...haha 
goodnight everyone ..sleep tight xoxoxo"

"event","i slept on the couch last night. karl was really upset about it this morning..he said he figured i would come to bed and in the morning we would wake up and apologize and everything would be all better and i asked him if it was all better and he said ""no"" ""because when i woke up you weren't next to me"" he asked me to remember what i feel like when he falls asleep on the couch and it's exactly like that for him too. maybe i did blow up over nothing last night but i dont think so. but we talked about it this morning and i dont know that it's exactly resolved but some things cant be fixed over night. i know that we love eachother and that we will be fine. everytime i even get a little pissed off at him all he has to do is flash me that smile and put his arms around me and i forget why i was upset..
when i get down i tend to put on happy music. music has an effect like nothing else. it can sweep over your body and bless your inner soul. especially the bloodhound gang.
xoxo this is the song currently on my myspace page.

"event","wednesday is vagina appreciation day...or as some call it V DAY...anyway karl has to work all day until 7 but he might be getting off work at 6 instead!! my dad is taking the kids and karl said he wants to cook me dinner but i kind of want to go out..because then we can have a nice dinner and we dont have to clean up!! i'm thinking of surprising him and taking him to bd's mongolian bbq in cleveland. he loves that place!! i'm not sure if i'm going to make him a card or buy him a generic hallmark card. right now i'm in favor of taking the generic way out. but i know it means more if i make it. but he's a guy so i'm not so sure that he is going to be like blown away or really care either way and he probably wouldn't care either way and in fact he probably wouldn't even notice i didn't get him a card..but i on the other hand aleady know that my card will rock!! because i got hima damn cat!!!! hahha 
anyway i guess the point is that we're together and in love and thats what the day is about.

"event","i think i may have mentioned ..if not in my live journal . then i might have in a blog on myspace...that for valentines day i got karl a kitten. the thing is i went to pick one out and came home with 2..they are so adorable and loving and i am so attatched. 
it was so cute because i told emily all day that i had a surprise for her. we went to the store and bought all the stuff for the kittens and she thought we were buying it for someone for a gift for their new kitty. she seriously had no clue. we went to get them at noon and as we were walking in the house she saw kittens and she said awwww you have kittens...hah she still didn't get it..so i said ""emily how would you like to take one home. her eyes got so big and so full of anticipation , it was so cute!!
well there were 3 kitties left and 2 of them were identical twin boys..they have all the same markings to a t. we had to take them both!! haha well...i had already mentioned to karl that she had 2 left that looked exactly the same and he said we should just get them both, and me being the non cat person that i am was not to keen on that idea..but after seeing them i couldn't resist. and actually fell instantly attatched to them ..which is odd because i never felt that way about drew. 
on our way home  i told emily she could name one. together we came up with the name boston. 
after arriving home and getting settled in and placing different collars on both cats to tell them apart and after 3 name changes to the remaining un named kitten karl came up with the name Punxutawney. hahaha karl loves the movie groundhogs day and we had already chosen a city name for the other kitty..so our new babies names are Boston and Punxutawney. they are actually quite a joy to have around. they keep occupied ..they give kaiden a constant chew toy..and the best part they are liter trained and ready for neutering and declawing!!!
so their full names are...
Punxutawney Pennsylvania youngblood (punx) and (Punxin) are his nicknames
and Boston Brighton youngblood  and (BB's)

i will have pix posted on myspace later tonight...
xoxoxxoxo
the ever growing family!!!"

"event","yesterday i got my hair done..i'm not sure how i feel about it yet...she said she had to cut some of my hair becuase the bleach and color still didn't take some of the black off the ends...but i think hairstylist get all caught up and addicted to the chop chop chop sound of the scizzors becuase she took like 5 inches off my hair!!! i've been trying so hard to grow it out...and she just cut like 8 months of hair off..so i was pretty sad...the color looks alright but i'm going to have to get it done in a couple months have it rebleached becuase after 2 applications of bleach i still have black in my hair...eventually i'm hoping my hair will grow long all the black will be out and i will have a pretty copper color in my hair...
also yesterday i had an appointment with my pyschiatrist he doubled my dose of wellbutrin and put me on lamictal ...right now i'm on this 5 week kit..which will eventually get me up to 200 mg. but last night i only had 25 ..and it knocked my ass out..like i had taken a tranquelizer..it was pretty neat.. 
and last night i had the best nights sleep i've had in a long time long time!...

this morning around 4 in the morning i had a past life dream. in this dream it became so clear to me why i feel so close to emily...i have alwasy thought that me and my daughter shared this really strong bond..if you saw us together you would completely understand...

in the dream i was emily. I had to very loving parents. my father was a general in the british army and my mother was an extremely beautifull socialite. i'm guessing i lived sometime in the 1700's.. i was about emilys age she is now, in the dream. its all a little foggy now..but basically we died in a housefire that was set by a radical group that hated my father becuase he was a leader in the military. i think we may have been living in england. but i'm not quite sure. 
it all felt so real and so comfortable..and i remember waking up and imidiately i went and checked on emily becuase the dream was very vivid. 
so thats all for now..i have a gazillion things to do before i go back to work. my 3 days off went by wayyyy to fast!!!"

"event","me and karl are getting a joint checking account...this is a serious step in the direction of you know what... we're going to see how well we manage finances together..before taking the next big step. :) 
he got fucked by first meritt today...i've been telling him how shitty they are as a bank for a couple years now..and today he finally got it. FUCK FIRST MERRIT!!!! i used to bank with them and they fucked me over so bad..and i know of so many other ppl they have fucked over as well..the only ppl who don't realize how bad they fuck ppl over are ppl who have enough money in their account that they dont see the fees they constantly take out of your account. seriously if your considering banking with them DONT. and if you already do cancel your account. because if you dont you will eventually see that what i'm talking about is so true...on a lighter note!! 
my little stud muffin kaido is walkin like crazy..talkin like crazy and turning 1 this month. i will call everyone to let them know of his party!! i'm having a huge curious george cake made for him. actually mom is getting it made by a custom cake decorator that she knows. for christmas her friend gave her a 50 dollar gift certificate to her shop. so my mom said she is going to have the cake made. and then of course a little cake for kaiden he has to have a milk free cake..anything for my prince . i cant believe my baby is going to be one. me and karl were talking about it last night and we both got a little sad. our baby 1 years old already. it has gone by way to fast. and then it kind of made me sad that i wont get to have any more babies. sometimes i do regret getting fixed . there are things i dont miss about babies ...like the lack of sleep . fussy tummies...the first cutting of the teeth...but the positives WAY out weight the negatives. and there are so many things i will miss. i will never again have a first birthday. or hear my little one say mama for the first time. and actually i'm a little sad to never be pregnant again or experience childbirth. sometimes i still think of my time in the hospital and how amazing karl was. and we had such a good time laughing and how much of a support system he was for me. and how everyday he made me feel beautifull. and after kaiden was born he told me there was no other place he would want to be and how much he loved our baby and that melted my heart. he was so adorable and so instantly in love with kaiden and sometimes it still melts my heart to see how amazing he is with him and how much he loves him. both my kids are lucky their dads are great.
another thing lately is i'm hating turning 26. i feel like i'm getting so old and it depresses me. 
i however am getting so excited about going to colorado in may. i cant wait to see everyone back home!! 
i made a list of things i want to accomplish this year to make me feel not so unaccomplished. a couple of the things are
play my bass more
play my sax more
take a pottery class
join an excersize group
go back to colorado 
go snowboarding atleast 6 times
get emily on the slopes
start learning how to sew
and by the end of the year!!!
START MY OWN DAYCARE
there are more. i've already accomplished 2
*get back in the pants i was wearing before i got pregnant
*stop drinking pop and eating sugar
and on wednesday luci is helping me accomplish one more goal...i'm changing my hair color...
i'll post pics on myspace thursday....it's going to be alot different!!
oh and the superbowl sucked ass this year..and i was going for the bears and they totally dissapointed me..well gotta go change a shitty diaper!!! 
love

went home hungry cos each dish took an avg of 1/2 hr to reach us :/ and it'd be cleared within mins while we were elsewhere taking photos. boo :( but otherwise, those i've tried were quite yummy :)
programs were so-so. las vegas-like dancers..runway show.. i doubt anyone was paying attention thou. only until the segment on retirement of the managing partner. pretty touching.  scary thou to think about our staff directory photos appearing on a collage of his face :/

didn't sleep much that night.
ended up not being about to go for main comm outing :(


can someone enlighten me on what's happening to me?
is it the wrong environment? or wrong perception on my own?

i don't wanna feel this way everyday. and it gets worse on sundays :("

"event","went for tcm yesterday evening, which resulted in a severely bruised leg from then on. and ache/pain even when i stand still. and slight fever. sighh.
the treatment had hurt so freaking much that i screamed/cried out in pain uncontrollably. paiseh ttm *'.'*


last wednesday marked the 1st anniversary of my <S>career</s> <S>working</s> shitty life.
had super xiong training whole of the week.
met daughter for lunch (lucky girl who's going to start work only like later).
received more news of ppl leaving. currently, half out of the 15 headcount we had has left/is leaving.

we have realised,
people leave not becos of better job opportunities. but rather, they're so sick and tired of the environment here. which i find quite true.
the sector wouldn't be shitty,
if we have nicer seniors/mgrs around.
if we have less politics.
if we have less gossips/backstabbings.

anyway, 1st anniversary means, start of the cycle again.
back to centennial.
back to a 8-month engagement.
back to the nightmare."

"event","i have a new boss named matthias.
don't understand why the whole world calls him mer-thigh-yers.

buffet with him, the partner, my fav sm, and clients at furama few days back.
the sashimi was soooooo good! :D
desserts were nice, except for the plate of probably 0.5kg of durian paste which looked like, quote from somebody, ""a lump of shit.""
and it doesn't have the durian scent at all.
food was quite okay. it's one of the few places with halal food so that rina can join us :)

overall, nice. but i think it's only worth the 1-for-1 price for most cc. which is about 30+ per pax. otherwise, i probably wouldn't go back to the place again.



had viral infection the next morning after the buffet.
i had thought it's food poisoning or something. wahahaa. but wells, apparently it's cos of the rain i got last week. 
anyway, it was the very nice doc on duty again :) so i booked an appt for surgery/consultation at the same time (finally).
the nurse would call me back within this week.. but i'm beginning to chicken out (again). and i can't decide if mt E, or gleneagles is better. or just the parkway medical clinic which is more convenient :/



i cannot stand ppl who sends me SMSes continuously. every morning/afternoon/after work. sends even when i'm not replying at all.
#$@^!&*



1 of my friends tendered yesterday.
1 of them left officially yesterday.


when is it my turn?"

"event","just when i was hoping for a REAL escapade, it came to me (:
finally a trip without having to plan single thing, no worries about expenses and itinerary, and being chaffeured throughout is enjoyment ttm!

go-kart was superrrr shiok. esp the race part, lol.
so was impromtu durian experience.
the non-seafood seafood feast was just weird. but yummy anyways.


my HP laptop is dying ): have to send it for servicing for at least 2 weeks! pffft.
was doing a clean-up and back-up for the laptop when i realised i haven't got many photos in my HD. HOW COME??? that kind of disappointment shucks man. just when u finally have time and as so looking forward to view some old pics, you CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE in any laptops. roar.

STILL, the backup needs about 5hours? ohmigosh. dunno why so freaking long.
so i decided to do it on monday instead.
probably send the laptop for servicing on tues then.

*prays hard*

discussion meeting was good just now. quite joyous!
i like the 1/2 interaction thingy. instead of just sharings-that-the-presentor-is-not-interested-in-sharing-or-doing-so-for-the-sake-of-doing-it-and-listeners-not-interested-in-even-pretending-to-listen :X
honestly, the good thing is, the ywd leader wasn't present. no need for anybody to act busy, to spare the awkwardness. ahems.
i hope it continues.

"event","broke down in office last night. too much pent up tension.
thankfully most people had left. 

abit of 'counselling' from the manager.. jw got me milo from the vending machine for dinner, and we carried on with work. sad life.

the sis having her birthday celebration overseas and we're intending to surprise her with a cake at the hotel!

i'm super envious.
my birthday was spent working, tired from the previous few days of late nights. my family members were either sleeping/doing their own things/having exams.

what celebration? what cake? i had to dinner alone n wash the dishes in the dark.

sigh.

sucks to be me.


wanted to drop by the pc show to get the lh700.
but i seriously do not wish to see the crowd.
what's more, not yet done with the planning of the trip. haven't changed currency. and tired physically/mentally.

so much for bringing the family for a holiday. it seems to be adding more pressure than lessening it.

really sucky life."

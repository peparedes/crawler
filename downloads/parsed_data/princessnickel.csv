"event","ever feel like sometimes youve been kicked to the side of the road while life moves on?
feeling like im left to pretend that every things okay and that its time to move along myself and just shut the hell up 
hard to go forward when it feels like history is swallowing me alive yet erasing me at the same time
that the future is just going to be a series of steps i may never climb and i'll just be sitting at the bottom waiting for someone to take my hand and show me that i can walk though them and something so much better is on the other side.
such an evil circle i sometimes feel i dont have the power to break free, to let myself go, irresposibility is no longer an option and heavy is the burden i feel i shall carry alone for a long time, there are those points of light, those laterns along the path, and i am eternally in debt to their guidance and warmth, its hard to live along the waters edge"

And poor Vinny, he was standing around just sweating, i think so far in the week he had taken 20 baths/dips in the mini pool...hes just like his mama no tolerance for the humid heat. It was so humid one night I walked outside and actually started choking on the damn air! Hes doing excellent with the potty training at my moms, but hes still a little skittish on the potty at home. And how cute is he that he puts himself to sleep now. Just 20 mins ago he comes up to me a goes ""nig nig"" and then takes my hand and walks into the bedroom and waits for me to put him in the crib, then he lays down and has been out for like 17 mins. I love him :-)"

Sometimes I just dont know where it all goes. But I know I dont waste it, hell the only money I spend on myself is my lunch money for work and this month I bought myself a mothers day gift:A cute little ring with mine and Vinnys birthdstone in it.
Ive decorated and sent out my notebook plus two other notebooks which i must admit is a little more costly than i thought it would be, but its fun having mail to look forward to and to do something thats got nothing to do with work or anything in general really. 
Going to be working a couple long day stretches over the next two weeks, which is totally going to suck but I need to save up $ so I can file my custody papers, Im tired of vinny being exposed to halfass parenting on the y-chromosome side.

"event","Life is finally slowing down! 
Things are getting normal again at work, jess and eddie are adjusting as well as can be expected and things with me and scott remain about the same. Its hard not having emmy here but I know in time it will be easier...Vinny misses her though....he points at her pic and says ""mem me"" and gets mad when he cant find her. That really pulls the heartstrings...
The newest excitement is that we have started potty training Vinny...he uses the potty all day for my mom but for me forget it....youd think i was setting him in front of the firing squad when i sit him on the toilet. I got to see Becky over the weekend...its nice to see her being the person i remember even though i am so different it seems now. I wonder how much the prettiness has changed, but then again im sure shes much the same.
Life moves so quickly, i feel so accomplished and such a slacker all in the same day, prioritizing gets harder and some days i wish i could just stay in bed. But i tell myself I have to move on, have to be the best i can in all my relationships, and put vinny and work first, but its hard when i just want to maintain some version of a social life...i had no where to go and no one to be with when my mom had vinny, i felt really low
but im trying to fill up my spare time and cram each day full of life as much as possible, i dont want to ever take the little things and doing nothing but watching him sleep or play alone for granted either. Balance is hard for a reason though I guess. i dont if any of this made sense to anyone else but I just had to put it all down. 

-ive started my notebook, hopefully i can get it out on time- and if you are my m4m partner im starting to think of little things to get sent out for ya!"

Which meant i drove down there @2am and i've only had 9 hrs of sleep over the past three days and i drove back here to go to work in the wee hours of the morning today. I worked today and I'm working sunday and headed back early monday morning and drive back here later again tuesday night. This disease is really starting to take its toll on us all physically, emotionally and financially.
 Thankfully its looking like shes only going to need a bi-pap machine at night and continous nasal oxygen throughout the rest of the day. I know how shitty does that shound, such a beautiful baby girl on oxygen for the rest of her life. We have had the worst experiences of our lives during round of sickness from not breathing at all to, not being told about her lung collapsing, to being told about if we needed to make DNR orders, to the terrible lack of medical attention, to the deplorable conditions of the ""parental rest areas"" We hope she can come home soon, as long as we can get her eating and nothing else collapses or relapses maybe mid week *crosses fingers* This disease(SMA) sucks and I would never wish it on anyone. Say a prayer for my lil niece, she needs all the help she can get."

Speaking of the kiddo, hes learned a new word....Sh@t! Nice and loud and attention drawing in the middle of places like Walmart and blockbuster video..im so proud! More surprised that its not F^ck, which is a word i use in probably every sentence i utter while driving. 
How about my mother just gave my sister $100...uh hello, Im the first born what do I get? I'd call her but then I would feel bad that Im just using her for the money, but then again this is her and to a certain extent i think she deserves it...

I have passed my 30 day mark at work, I would be more excited if I knew that I got my dollar raise or not...my supervisors help ""just look at your pay check, if your check is bigger then you know you got it."" Meanwhile there is no formal review process so if I didnt recieve a raise I may never know why not. 
Grandma is now home from the hospital after a two week stint, only now to be lugging around O2 tanks and cord wherever she may go. Carols knee replacement surgery is about 3 weeks in the books and she still cant bend her leg or do most things involved with life remotely close to on her own.
Carla and the kids moved in with my parents and I believe thats going so-so. My dad is totally stressed from the above mentioned details and my entire family is stressing over lil em because  the doctor shes hypotonic and thats a possible early indicator for C.P. We were supposed to have early intervention services come yesterday but the woman went to the wrong address and never bothered to call and let us know she had 'attempted' to come. So now we have to wait for another uncertain amount of time until they can get her in again. 
Vinny is growing so fast, he walked across the room at Missie's last night! Thats the most steps hes ever taken on his own, I wish I would have seen it, but of course working mommy had to miss it. His birthday plans are finally finalized, 2-4:30 at the YMCA pool on Nagel Rd on Nov 27th for those who are interested. He is also taking to sippy cups well and should be ready to start milk very soon, lets just hope its not a repeat of the formula fun we went through, quite honestly I dont think I have any more clothes left to puke on!

*Vinnys up by 8:30, after playing, chasing him around and saying my new favorite words ""Vinny NO!"" about a million times, its time for my breakfast while he drinks his morning bottle. Except theres a kitchen full of last nites dinner escapade I was too tired to clean, so I had to clean it this morning.
*Its now 10 and Jess calls and tells me shes coming over now, because for some strange reason she and emmy are ready to face the world before noon.
*10:30 arrives and Vinny is finally ready to eat his cereal, I munch a handful of apple jacks...
*10:40 Jess arrives,with breakfast from mcdonalds (i quickly decide the steak egg and cheese bagel is host to bad foreign meat that smells funny and I should never eat it, i toss it aside eating only the bagel, scraping off weird seasonings) I leave Vinny to finish his cereal alone knowing the chaos I'll have to clean up, I gather things for a kitchen sink bath cause I just cant bend over that long and squeeze between my tub and toilet which are about 18 inches apart for the next 20 mins.
*10:53...Vinny decides to rain on the floor via spray nozzel getting none of it in the sink
*11 Vinny is clean and running amuck naked in the living room...im praying he doesnt pee on emmys car seat just a few steps away
*11:15 Vinny is diapered and viewing teletubbies. Jess is calling to get em a new dr...I sort through Vinnys clothes to find something that a.) fits the lil bugger and b.) is weather apporpriate, got to love erie, jess decides he needs to wear cool,jeans and a tee it is 
*11:33 I finally get to the shower. Vinny manges to let Jess dress him 
*12pm  Everyone is dressed, fed, and ready to go.
*12:15 Enter pnc bank, want to cash in loose change, order new checks
*12:35 Leave pnc bank with 27 dollars,a box of checks and insight into the crazy co fair lady and her thoughts about maggots
*12:45 Stop at Jess's house..emmy peed through her outfit, eddie forgot to pack a spare in the bag
*1pm Get to ems dr office to forward her records and even though shes supposed to have an apt on thurs, the office is vacant and closed due to remodeling
*1:20 get to co fair, buy gas with my discount card for $2.68!
*1:30 get to halloween store to discover, online costumes much cuter and cheaper!
*1:45 enter mall: stop at a variety of stores
*sometime around 2:30 realize Vinny has stolen a skirt from the Childrens Place, quietly return to the shelf, wondering how the alarm didnt sound exiting or re-entering the store...spend next 20 mins laughing about it, do some more mall crusing
*4:30 exit mall
*5pm enter walmart, proceed to spend 45 minutes buying only $30 of stuff, very proud of self 
*5:30 exit walmart
*6pm get home, unload purchases, say good bye to jess, arrange carols flowers, get ready for dinner
*6:30 feed Vinny entire jar of stage 3 dutch apple desert, give bottle,put in play yard and think about making dinner
*7pm scrap plans to visit carol in hospital (only cause vinnys napping) scrap dinner plans order take out
*8:30 Vinny is in bed
*9pm-present I settle down for a nite of primetime tv, only to be disappointed when JD is selected to be the new lead singer of INXS...

But a great sadness follows, in that now I must spend 8 hours a day away from my lil guy and lets face it folks he really is my whole world. 
 The job is at a national answering service...not so much a callcenter (there is no telemarketing) but more of an answering machine with a real person on the other end. I work second shift and alternate weekends and holidays. Its nothing even remotely close to my field but its a job, it pays around $200 a week and gives me free health insurance after 6 months.
 On a semi related note, how is it fair that the day I find out I have a job, my boyfriend goes out with his friend...Eh Im not really that upset but he better bring me home something cool!
 To the left of this entry you will find proof that my son is doomed to be some sort of geek, he already likes to spend time on the computer. *Gold star* to anyone who can tell me whats on the screen (and no enlarging the image, besides it will probably be too pixelated to help!)"

Well, I'll tell you...every single interview I have went on this summer has resulted in me being sent a politically correct letter of rejection. Why don't they just use a big rubber stamp that says ""Unemployable"" and plaster it across my forehead?!? I have never felt so useless in my entire life. Tell me again why I even bothered with college? And let me just say that my ability to tolerate other peoples B*ll Sh*t is starting to rapidly decrease...I dont care how much hair gel he had or where he gets his perfectly pressed khakis and pin stripe shirt....I just want a damn job!

"event","I've begun planning Vinny's first birthday party...have almost all the decorations, all the invitations, but the place to have it is proving to be quite difficult. My place is totally too small, and no family member has a big enough place inside to have it at, seeing how I had to have my darling little boy in NOVEMBER!!! I know it doesnt matter to him, but it matters to me and i know it matters to my some day could be inlaw family,  which i totally want to invite but who knows who will actually show up. They are all so far away and so much older, literally, like most are close to senior citizen discounts! Then its all about what do i have at the party~ appetizers, coffee, tea and cake, or a pot luck dinner, or find an inexpensive way to cater it. If its too kids based, the adult family wont come, if its too adult, the kids will be bored....games, prizes, dj? Id worry less (only mildly) if I didnt have to start paying on my student loans next month as well...

Oh well I'm giving up for the night and turning of my mind to watch SheSpies!"

 I had the most non irish st pattys day ever, a grilled stuft burrito, diet pepsi and phish food ice cream, not that I am complaining but I would have killed for some green beer...even the cheesey little quarter draft kind! oh well, life goes on.
 I cant wait for classes to be done, 1 month and 17 days not counting weekends and holidays...i think i will apply and work at west, potential to make a ton of money there and i dont think i really care what ill be doing anymore. 
 The only thought that crosses my mind is must leave the boro, must move on with life, explaing that to my brain as i have another whole year of school to finish. Next semester should be easy class load though, only 2 SHLD classes, but damn math is trying to kill me again.
 The presidental election is next week. Eric and Andrea are my competitors so far, i'd be concerned only to the fact that andrea may pull votes from me and eric may win on a stupid technicality...god i dont want to go through that again.
 But alas the formal is next weekend, jenny is coming up and all will temporarily be well with the universe, one would hope."

Thing is I didnt have a horrible time and I might actually go back...but the nite I see my sister there...thats the day I never go back...

"event","I was just reading all the convos i saved...and my journal things...and now im just thinking of shit that happened to me. And things i miss. And things i will always remeber...
 
1. Camp...camp was ooo great i had a kick ass time. met some awesome ppl. I love them all and miss them. Cant wait to see them...Briuana i have never laughed so much in my life!

2. Wildwood...omg wildwood. Im so glad i went. We had the best times down there. I met 2 kick ass hotties who i love...and met the love of my life. Who knows how i feel...and i just remeber all the laughs we had down there...boardwalk beach waterpark lawn chairs the floor 4:21 ""bye sweetie"" and so many more mems...cant wait till next year!

3. Sydney moving...boo hoo...i miss that chick...i will never 4 get her...and the mems we have...I remember when we said good-bye i didnt wanna let go..I miss her!! I love u...u zesty bitch

4. New Years Eve...LOL that was a great night...me briana Chris Dennis and Brian....lol we had some fun

5. All the track meets this year. And i think of how good i am and how much better i can be. I think of the laughs me and Briana had and meeting all new ppl. And now im going to miss that cause im not running indoor track nect year...cause im going to new school.

6. Falling in love...I love this kid to death. I love him like we were together for ever. I will never stop loving him. He means everything to me in everyway. I never thought i would feel this way for someone. But when i saw his face i knew it. Its like that saying...""do u believe in love at 1st sight?"" My answer to that is yes. I would ne thing for this kid and do ne thing or give ne thing to be with him. All i have to do is when im down is think of him and im all happy and all my probs seem to go away! I love him alot.

7. Me and Briana have our 1st ""deep"" convo. Me and her talked for like 3 hours and it was such a good convo. She made so much sence when she was talking. She didnt have to re-explain her self. I have been friends with her since 8th and 2 years later we have one of these best friend convos. I hope me and her have one of these ""deep"" convos soon! I love ya girl. Briana u always make me smile when im down! Thanks babe

8. Katie becoming my sister...even tho we really anit sisters...but yeah. I can tell that girl ne thing ne time of the day. And i can say it ne way and she will understand! Shes i only one i can really trust to talk to about things i feel. I love her alot...and i dont know where the hell i'd be right now if it werent for her. Ktie i love u chicka...ur the best and i have a kick ass times when we are together!
    There probably more shit...but those are some of the best times i can remeber! I love u guys alot! Thanks! Love always Cassie"

I dunno someone just said something about dennis and how he dicked me over...and i just lost it. I dont even know y i even botherd with him. Rj was right from the begining. But i made the dumbass mistake to go for Dennis and not Chris. But o well. I dont even wanna bother with them. Me and Chris are better as betsest friends. But than Briana slept over. We stayed on line till about i say...12:15. Than we went downstairs. Me and her had a deep ass convo. Me and her never talk like. She made me think so much. But i thought about good things. She just talked about how her and matt were 2gether and everything that they had. And it made me realize...that that is that i want from Paul. Like i dont want to see him everyday. Like maybe every weekend or other weekend. And talk as much as we can in between. I can truly see myself with him for a long time. I never last longer than  a month. Cause im to scared to love someone and have my heart broken. But im like already in love with Paul. And i have to figure out away to tell him that?! But ne ways...Than today...NO SCHOOL!!!! O yeah me and briana talked till about 3:45 in the morning. My mom wakes us up at like noon...cause brianas mom was coming in like an hour. Chris calls and asks us to hang out. So we make plans to go to the mall. We meet tham at the mall. And hung with them. After briana left me and Chris talked and had a good talk. And yeah. But ne who...tiffanys party was soo sweet!! Besides Paul and Nick being there...i had the time of my life! Me and katie danced took mad pics of everyone...(mostly Paul and Nick) So i have to leave my mommy a note in the mornign to take my cams to a one hour photo...cause i want them back really bad!!! Ne ways...mid terms start morrow. Boo hoo!! im going to fail. But now i know that next year im going to sussex tech. I'll be with Chris!!! YAY!!! Im going to shadow him one day at school.

"event","Jefferson Township Highscool sucks big time. I hate it and dont want to go there next year. But i got suspened on friday. @ days in school on tuesday and wednesday. What i did...i told off my english teacher. (mrs. scudder) shes a fucking bitch. I just had it with her bull shit. She cant teach for her life. And if she ttied i wouldnt understand it. So i flipped a shit on her. I said something like this....""your class is bull shit. we dont do crap. U cant treach for ne thing. All u do is put work in fron of our faces and say hear do this. I havent learned jack shit from u. I have had u for 2 years dide i learn freaking thing no. That bull shit work book we have dont teach me shit either."" And i think there was more nut i dont know. And on the paper thingy she sent up to mr perzaks office was all bull shit. She said i called her a fucking bitch and that her class fucking sucks. All i said was the her class freaking sucked that was it. No word fucking in there. So i got 2 day in school for that. If i ever saw her outside of school i swear i would just knock her out. Last year she use to be all nice. This year shes a bitch. She said that ll the stress she has right now is from me cause i what i did last year. Last year i gave her some probs but i was sick than. Dude i just hate her!!!!
     Ne ways.... Ashley G is pissed at me for some reason and i have no clue why? I think its cause i had julie sleep over after thanksgiving and went ot the mall with my bro the next day and went to dinner with my mom and dad...and i didnt go and sleep at her house afterwards. Well i dunno but sorry 4 what ever i did. I talked to Paul today. He go into a motcylce crash on route 80. But hes OK!!! thank god. He said he dont think he has ne broken bones or ne thing. Well Paul i hope u r feeling better!!! I miss u! Nick hasnt been on line in long ass time. I miss talklin to him. I want to ask him when hes coming up tp vist me and katie?!
    But hmmm....yesterday was fun. Me aktie my mom and her mom went to the mall. Me and katie walked around by our selves. And we meet up with her b/f. Hes a little cuttie. Him and his friedns are a little crazy. But thats ok. Than that night my family and her family went out to eat. That was fun. Me an katie talked about wildwood and all the fun we had. And next year is going to kick ass!!! Ne ways...ahley just told me that she dont want to go on the crusie with me ne more. Because she thinks julie is more important to me. Thats not true. Me and ashley are just growing apart and i still love the girl but i dunno?  But i done writng in this thing....i need to think. i do that to much but thats all i can do now a days....im out love always and 4 ever Cassie"

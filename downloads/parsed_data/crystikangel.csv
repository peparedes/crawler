Yea so the Spurs fuckin' won!  And I'm pissed about it...
But more pissed at what the Dallas Mavericks owner said...ok...I don't like the Spurs.  But I love my city...I love my state!  Here's what he had to say...

""Would we rather have Jason there? Of course,"" Cuban said . ""There's not going to be one fan in there that doesn't believe that we can kick their butt all the way back to that ugly-ass, muddy-watered thing they call a Riverwalk.""

Ok...now...you're the fuckin' owner of a team. Show some maturity and leave the shit talking to the fans!  Who does that...honestly???  Not to mention a while back ago he pretty much said that Phil Jackson was his bitch.  NO!  I don't think so.  Phil is prolly the most powerful coach out there and Mark Cuban isn't but a fuckin' flea on Phil's zen tofu turkey or something of the sort!  So this guy is on my hit list.  
Anyway...everyone knows I don't like the Spurs...and my friend decided he wanted to argue with me about non Spurs fans in San Antonio...so I decided I'd share this with y'all!
(JennZ...this is where you can stop reading! haha cuz I already sent you this on my space)

Victor: your just hating cause me and the rest of the spurs fan can strongly feel another champion ship trophy goin into that case at the at&t center. your no better then the people and commentators that talk shit about the spurs cause they are humble and dont bragg about winning championships and dont sell out to corporations like nike and do dumb ass commercials like lebron or hamilton. and especially fuck charles barkely !! lol

Crys: wow, you're puttin' words in my mouth...but if thats what you wanna believe go for it...
Victor: hey if you live in sa and you dont like the spurs then just move to another city !! lol
Crys: yea...a spurs fan would say that...i should know better...but you know what...you keep believing that all san antonians MUST like the spurs...how close minded can you get
Crys: btw...because your mexican you can only listen to beaner music
Victor: lol close minded ? you prolly lived as long as i lived here remember you graduated a year after i did... so your calling yourself closeminded as well 
Crys: what?! lol i don't know what you're talkin' about...im callin' you close minded bc you think that people from SA must like the spurs...how does that put us in the same category??

I had this horrible dream today.

I was babysitting my cousin Annabella when some guy asked me to go out with him.  I really wanted to go out with him so I decided I'd go drop Annabella off at my friend Candace's house.  I was feeling really bad for what I did, because she was my responsibility so I had no right to leave her in the care of someone else.  Anyway, we're on our date...which oddly enough is held at Candace's house.  We're just sittin' in her living room talkin' with her family and watching a movie.  Annabella is in Candace's dads office playing with CJ (Candace's brother).  I'm still feeling completely shitty...then there's this loud explosion.  It sounds and smells as if a giant airbag just went off (trust me, I'm a fucking expert when it comes to airbags).  I see flames rising from the office and I try to run to make sure Bella is out of there.  Everyone holds me back and I'm crying, and tryin' to get loose so I can get to her.  They drag me and take me outside and I figured CJ had grabbed Bella and ran outside with her, that's why they weren't letting me get into the office.  Well when I'm outside I'm lookin at everyone's face checkin' to see if it's Bella.  I look at everyone at least 5 times.  It took me a while to realize it.  She wasn't out there.

I woke up scared half to death, and I was shaking, and I couldn't breathe.  It felt like I was running around screaming like a maniac, but I was just layin' there."

"event","I honestly don't know what I want in life.  The guy that I mentioned, the one I think is starting to really like me came over the other day.  We messed around...BIG TIME...and I dunno...I think my favorite part of the day was when we started watching the movie cuz I was curled up against him.  And also when we fell asleep together.  After he left I was kinda thinkin' for some reason that I wouldn't hear from him again.  That night I had officially made up my mind.  He wasn't gonna call me anymore...and just as I said that he messaged me sayin' ""Hey I just got home, I'm kinda buzzed I don't want you to think I dissed you.""  I talked to him on the phone today but I was kinda rude, I don't know what my deal is!
OK, so the physical thing is fun sometimes...but I don't think that's what I want.  I want someone who loves me for me...who can put a hold on all things physical.  Someone who I can have come over to my house and we can actually JUST WATCH a movie.  We didn't even watch 5 minutes of the movie when he was here!  But then again I could be making this shit up...maybe all I want is something physical, no feelings attached.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!!!
It pisses me off that I'm the way that I am.  I wish I could just make up my mind.

I don't understand why!!  I mean I want that fairy tale romance.  Maybe since I've never really had it, the thought scares me.  I think it might also have to do with bein' scared of heartbreak.  There was only one other guy that I KNEW for a fact would have treated me like a fuckin' queen...who woulda bent over backwards for me...and I got the same feelin' for him that I'm feeling now and I never talked to him again.  I ignored his calls...his IMs.  I could prolly be happily married by now.  I dunno, I am gonna give this guy a chance though, maybe he's the one that can make me NOT SCARED of love. Maybe he's the one that can tear all my walls down..."

Yea...
Today we were goin' to a funeral at 10 in the morning.  While leaving our subdivision we saw this car FLY out of the Shell gas station...that was the last normal thing I remember.  Everything else was in slow motion.  He was drivin' like a bat outta hell so he ended up in our lane.  My mom tried to veer into the left lane to avoid him, but at the same time...this ASSHOLE straightened out and hit the entire passanger side of my moms car.  I remember my head wobbling around...and I remember pain...once I was able to tell which way was up the first thing I did was reach to feel my nose, good...my nose ring was ok.  I couldn't open the door cuz I was sittin' behind the passanger seat and our side was completely smashed in.  The FUCKER took off.  He was nowhere to be seen.  I was pissed the fuck off.  I was cursing him and I was just angry.  People came out from the Shell and they told us that they had seen the guy, he was flaming pissed when he got into his car.  Well anyway...this man drove up and asked my mom if it was her car.  When she said yes he told her ""I know who hit you, I live across the street to him and he's a drug dealer so I can't give you my name.  But he lives...""  So he lives in this house on my street in a house that STANDS OUT.  Because their house is painted like an american flag.  So we give the cop all the information...and he tells us he's gonna go check the house out.  We were able to drive the car home...I felt so bad for my mom cuz she was crying...when it rains...it pours.  She's the only source of income, and havin' a wrecked car doesn't really help.  The cop stopped by and told us that he went to the house and what happened was it was a ""girl driving and she got scared so she drove home...what had happened was the car is standard so it got stuck in 1st gear thats why she lost control of the car.""  BULL SHIT....THERE WERE WITNESSES THAT SAW THE DRIVER WAS A GUY!  But my mom was like whatever as long as my car gets paid for...the girl had USAA insurance.  Anyway...later on this lady came to our house and said she lived across from the people.  She said that she heard the guy talkin' on his cell phone outside...he was talkin' to his dad who is a bails bondsman...and he's the one that told him to tell the insurance company that the girlfriend was driving.  She told us to watch out cuz they're not good people....just to becareful. She said she had already called the cops and told them what she heard.  As she was leaving she said ""I didn't tell y'all anything!""  
So...at this rate...I'm scheduled for another accident in November.  So far for the past 8 months I've been in 3 accidents, one every 4 months EXACTLY!  Come November...I'm goin' on lockdown.  I'm not leavin' this house!
I should get back to the guests at my house..."

What am I supposed to do late at night when I wanna get online and find some completely weird people to talk to?!   I really dislike her right now.  What do I get in return for my precious precious computer?!  A CHEST OF DRAWERS!!!!
It's ok though because my baby senses bitches, and doesn't like them.  So eventually my mom will get tired of tryin' to work her.  It always happens...as soon as she tries to get on the computer it starts acting berserk!  I've taught her well :)  I'm really bummed out about this whole ""sitiation"" (Joyride ha...)
MAYBE...just maybe when I start goin' to school I'll be able to con her back into lettin' the computer stay in my room.  Yeah...that's it!!!

"event","Hey y'all.  I realize it's been like forever and a day!
Sorry I've neglected y'all.  Quite a bit has happened.  It would be crazy for me to try to go into detail on what I wanna tell y'all.  So...here's the overview...
In December/January I went to spend Christmas/New Years in Mexico!!! I hadn't gone to Mexico in about 4 years and I missed the HELL outta everyone!  I saw my friends...including my 1st love.  He tried to get in my pants, I acted like a bitch towards him, and I never saw him again.  I came home feeling that I still loved him.
In February I got my nose pierced one week.  The next week I turned 21.  And the following week I had a really bad accident.  I totaled my mom's Sentra, and the airbags fucked up my face.  My lips got super swolen, and I had to get my nose ring taken out.  IT HURT!
After the accident my body started actin' really weird...I went to the doctor.  I was diagnosed with Diabetes and High Blood Pressure.
I got my nose REpierced in May.  It hurt 2 times as bad as the first time!
Late May I got tired of the manager that took Qs place and I quit my job.
First week of June we went to Mexico.  My mom and my aunt stayed for like 5 days, I stayed an extra week.  I saw my friends again.  Flirted with my first love and messed around with my friend Ivan.  Ivan made me promise I'd go to his wedding in September...DUH I'm goin'.  He's a great friend.  Although we mess around sometimes (well everytime we get together for the most part)our friendship comes first.
I almost did something really stupid in regards to Jose (my first love).  I have no doubt I would have done it if he actually would have shown up for my goin' away party.  Fucker...that's what he did last time...when I went in December...he went to my ""Welcome back"" party, but not the goin' away one.  It makes me sad.  I really wanted to see him.  Oh well...I'm tryin' to convince myself that I am worth more than him, and that I love MYSELF more than I love him.  It's hard y'know.  For 8 years I've lived my life loving him more than anyone.  Now I'm tryin' to undo all the harm.
""One day I'll be able to look at him and my heart will stay in one piece.  One day he'll realize all I could have given him...and might still.  One day...I'll love myself more than I love him.....""
It really is hard...but I'll pull through.  He can never give me the love I dream of.  And I can't let myself settle for some mediocracy of a romance.  I want the kind of love that people envy.  One that lasts through the ages.  One that makes me want to be his and ONLY his.  Where he's mine and ONLY mine.  Right now I don't believe it's possible to be faithful to one person for the rest of your life...I don't really believe in love...I want more than anything to be proven wrong!
I don't really wanna get TOO heavily into this...I've gone a day without bein' depressed...I'm tryin' to see how much longer I can go.
Anyway, I think this sums up my first entry back.  I'll try to keep you posted more often, I definately don't wanna go months without writing again!
Have a great day y'all!"

"event","Just got home from work...it went...BLAH.  At first it was fuckin' busy, almost like a weekend.  Then when it started to die down I decided I was going to mentor someone.  So I'm listening to his calls and after a kinda rough call it sounded like he called the guy a jerk...I thought I was hearing things so I left things at that.  Like 3 or 4 calls later this person was trying to get a credit for a call because he'd gotten 3 wrong numbers.  He was lookin' for the police station.  The guy reads him the number and they guy said ""thank you"" and he was going to hang up so the person I'm listening to tells him ""excuse me...sir...excuse me...I'm trying to get you that credit sir, ONE MOMENT!""  Then after that when he was connecting the call i SWEAR TO BOB I HEARD him say ""asshole"" under his breath.  I talked to my manager and he said I needed to listen to more calls and then go talk to him.  If I heard anything like that again to go tell him and then he'd listen to some of his calls.  So I listened to a few more and they went well for a while.  Then came one in Las Vegas, they were lookin' for Office Bar on S Maryland Pkwy. He looked and looked and found 2 others on different streets.  So the guy is tryin' to tell him to try the name of another bar...or try a different street.  The CSR keeps talkin' over the guy and bein' rude.  So I called Q again and told him.  He told me to go pull him off the phone and let him know what I heard and the severity of it. I didn't feel comfortable doin' that because I'm not management...yet!  

So I went over and when I introduced myself he seemed ok..then I went straight into the calls...I told him it had sounded like he said something under his breath to that one man and he was kinda like ""...ok"" in a shocked way, then shrugged his shoulders.  Then when I went over the Vegas call with him I told him he needed to apologize anytime he interrupted a caller.  Even if it's the callers fault...he needed to interrupt.  Once again...he just said OK.  So yeah, that wasn't cool. 

 THEN when I was walkin' past my manager he tells me ""hey how'd it go Michelle?""  ***side note:  Michelle is my team lead, she's crooked, she walks lopsided, she wears her socks OVER her stretch jeans, she's big, ugly, white, she doesn't wash her hands when she goes to the restroom AND SHE PICKS HER FUCKIN' NOSE IN FRONT OF ME!!!*** So anyway...I looked at Mike...kinda baffled at first...I gave him a few seconds.  He's lookin' at me like ""well how'd it go?"" Finally I ask...""What did you call me!?""  He looks like he's tryin' to remember...then he says 'OH SHIT! IM SORRY! THAT'S TWICE!!' Yeah..cuz he called me Michelle like a few weeks ago!! So after that I avoided him the rest of the mornin'.  He kept tryin' to make me smile and GODDAMIT it was soooo fuckin' hard not to smile at his charm!!  But I bit my fuckin' lip and was able to carry out a serious face.  When I left I didn't tell him goodbye...I didn't even look at him.  And I just knew as I was gettin' into my car that when he got off work he'd call me...

At 6:40 my phone rings...and WHO IS IT?! Mike Q.  When I answered the first thing he asked was ""HOW IN HELL did you manage to get Thursday night off?""  Because people were denied left and right for that night off.  I was still serious...told him Brisa (my friend that is in charge of that)was able to approve it, that's all there was to it.  He apologized and explained why he'd done it.  He told me I couldn't get mad because I'd called him Gilbert once.  I told him that that wasn't as bad as this though.  Then he says ""oh really?  whos better looking? me or him?"" Of course I wouldn't answer that...but I told him that him and Gilbert were closer in galaxies than me and Michelle.  He agreed...but then reminded me of all the times that I promised I'd take him Starbucks but didn't.  So...I couldn't be mad anymore...then we started talkin' about one of my friends that is really touchy touchy with him.  He kept askin' me advice and he made it clear...""as a friend..."" It was just really awesome!  I love him...and I would OMG love to just kiss him.  But I really respect him.  And he told me that he's a big flirt but he'd never cheated on his wife.  Because he was all about sex in HS and he kinda got tired of it.  He said he's still a man though and has hormones...he said he wasn't sayin' that he'd never cheat on his wife...he wasn't plannin' on doin' it though.  Cuz shit happens...so...yeah.  He's awesome!  It really makes me feel good to know that he sees me as more than one of his workers.  To be honest friendship is the GREATEST thing that I could want from him.  He's a great guy...like he told me, he's always had a lot of girlfriends because he makes a good companion.  We talked for a while...about a lot of stuff.  Sorry...I'll stop ramblin' on.  :)  Just wanted to tell someone...and I have no one to talk to right now...so my journal is as best as it gets!"

"event","Yea...that weekend will be memorable because of all the GREAT things that happened.  But it will also forever suck because that same day that I wrote all of that.  About 5 hours later to be exact I had an accident.  I was waken up at 5:45 to go to the bank for my mom.  When I got back home I took an hour nap before I had to take Ernie to school.  On the way home from dropping him off...I fell asleep. All I remember is turnin' onto the main street in my neighborhood and seeing a long line at the 4 way stop.  Next thing I know I'm awaken with an airbag in my face somehome 5 streets AFTER the 4 way stop.  So I obviousely stopped at the stop sign but I don't remember.  It's a 2 lane street and I started driving into oncoming traffic.  The lady I hit had just backed outta her house and started goin' when she saw me comin' at her.  She tried to vere away, otherwise I woulda hit her head on.  She was drivin' an F250 so my lil truck didn't do much damage to her truck. My truck ended up being totaled...I now have no truck.  But on the good side, I also have no 400 dollar payment every month.

I've kept away for some reason...don't know why.  I need to get back into writing again.  Because I feel less depressed when I write my feelings down.  Plus...I still really wasn't completely over the accident.  Don't know if I ever will be.  I don't know if something could ever hurt me as much as my mom hurt me that night.  I was crying all day because I couldn't believe it...plus...IT WAS SCARY.  The sound, the smell, the burn of the airbags.  Waking up to that...I just can't explain it.  Anyway...EVERYONE was there to support me, hugs, kind words.  What does my mom do?  I go to her crying...she looks right past me and walks into the bathroom.  When she came out she tells me...""What are we going to do about Ernie?""  HELLO!!! ERNIE IS 11 YEARS OLD HE CAN FUCKIN' WALK TO SCHOOL...I'M YOUR DAUGHTER WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT AND I JUST HAD A FUCKIN' TRAMATIC EVENT!!!  Pissed me off.  THAT still hurts me.  And one day I hope I can tell her just how that made me feel.

Anyway...Candace was there for me the whole day...we spent all day together.  Luis came over, which kinda shocked me because I thought he didn't wanna see me anymore.  It was nice though, to have someone, rather, a guy...be there, you feel protected.  So yeah...Candace is great :)  She's always there for me no matter what...and I hope nothing like this ever happens to her, but I want to be able to be here for her whenever she needs someone.  

So, like Candace told me...this was a blessing in disguise.  NOTHING happened to me, but yet my truck was totaled.  The insurance is paying for everything.  All I have to do is get my jeep fixed.  That shouldn't cost too much money.  God really knows what he's doing.  And I know that sounds rather redundant...because...WELL DUH!! But still...he puts these things in our lives that we may think are horrible, we may think we'll never get out of.  But the benefit outweighs whatever pain you mighta gone through in the process.  He only makes us stronger.

That's crazy...Amber once told me that she had written something to Yamairah...words of advice...and she said that when she was writing them she couldn't remember where this stuff was coming from.  She didn't realize until after she'd written it what exactly she was saying.  That just happened to me right now...with what I was saying about God.

Anyway...I really gotta go...my mom wants me to call about our cell phones...Take care y'all"

"event","Ok, so this is the first time I relax in my house since Thursday I think.  My weekend was completely PACKED with lots of shit to do...some freakin' awesome...some not so awesome.  I don't really know where to start...but I've heard the beginning is pretty good....soo here goes...

Friday:  
Amber's in town so me n Candace want to hang out with her.  At around 10 pm we were supposed to go to the movies but when we got to Ambers house she said she didn't really feel well and told Logan to go with us.  Logan is her lil bro...I think he's 16.  We hung out at her house for a lil while.  Then Candace wanted to go to Bennigans so we took Logan with us.  We saw the hot waitor guy from the time that we went with Luis.  A black guy totally checked Logan out.  Logan wasn't happy about that.  Then Logan was tellin' us about his Bronco and the shop he takes it to and when he goes mudding and stuff.  He asked if we wanted to go with him...or rather take him by the shop.  We did and we decided to look around.  Not even 5 minutes after bein' there this guy...I think they call him Red asked me n Candace if we wanted to go mudding in the back of his ""dullie.""  We didn't know what the FUCK he was talkin' about so we're like sure!  We had no clue what we were gettin ourselves into.  We get into the back of this red truck...there are broken glass bottles everywhere...we go sit down and this other guy gets in too...his name is Thumper.  Red starts speeding off and we're like FUCK...what is he doing?  He was going super fast.  Then he starts doing donuts in the mud...he hits his big rock and we flew up at least six inches up...that's when I started to get real scared.  I thought he was going to fuckin' kill us.  Plus he kept getting really close to this ditch thing.  We were holdin' on to the railing of his truck for dear life and he goes thru this pile of wood.  Well a piece of wood (hard wood I might add...lol)flew up and hit my fuckin' middle finger.  It started to hurt real bad and I couldn't really hold on anymore.  Thumper kept askin' me if I was OK...I told him yes.  Right when we thought he was headin' back I hear Thumper say...""alright hold on!!""  and he goes full speed and started with the donuts again.  FINALLY we get back to the shop and Thumper is lookin' at my finger to see if I can move it and stuff.  It's obv. not broken he tells me it's going to be bruised.  This JACKASS (I don't know his name so if I need to refer to him again his name shall be JACKASS) asked me what happened and since I knew NOTHING of the pile of wood I told him a rock had flown up and hit me.  He looked at me...""A rock?""  As if I'm a 5th grader.  ""Yea...""  ""A ROCK?"" again he looked at me like I was a moron.  That's what I fuckin' said wasn't it?  Thumper explained to US the pile of wood and that that's what had hit me.  So then Logan tells us they're goin' to the ""den"" and asked us if we wanted to go.  Candace said she didn't and said she'd stay.  But I wasn't going to leave her.  There was this guy that was going to take his Jeep Wrangler.  It was real nice.  Everyone kept tryin' to get Candace to go.  She kept sayin' NO.  Finally Red was like alright get in the back of the Jeep.  Candace turned around REEAAAL fast and said ""oh HELL NAW..."" and climbed into Logan's Bronco super fast.  We wanted SOME kinda protection for our head.  So we start down' this bumpy ass muthafuckin' trail.  It's pretty cool...we go thru mud and stuff.  Then Logan's bronco got stuck and when he was tryin' to get out the knob for the 4WD had fallen off so he was holdin' it with one hand...and he pulls his cell phone out.  Someone asked ""are you callin' John?""  Logan goes ""No, I need it to see."" It was really funny cuz the knob shoulda been connected to the shifter thingy.  So then Thumper climbs outta the back window of the Bronco so he can try to help get Logan out...and as he's climbing out he yells ""Hey if you back up I'm gonna be pissed!""  LOL no sweetie if he backs up your gonna be DEAD!  So finally we get out...yadda yadda yadda.  We're standin' around watchin' the Wrangler and a Cherokee go up this really steep ""area.""  There was this one particular area that was about 4 ft high...when the Cherokee went up it only one tire was on the 4ft part...the other front tire was like kinda on level land...so the bitch flips to it's side.  It all kinda happened slow motion-like and I'm startin' to think tragedy here...all the guys hand us our beer and they run over to the Cherokee.  It's real quiet for a while then you hear...""THAAAAAT WAS AWESOME!!!""  They kept tellin' the guy drivin' that he had balls of steel.  So all the guys turn the Cherokee right side up again...we're there a lil longer...then we head back to the shop.  The JACKASS looks at Candace and tells her...""you have a lil somethin' on ur face you might wanna wipe off""  NO SHIT...we went mudding in the back of a truck a lil while ago...AND...we just went into the den with windows down!  Cock sucker!!  Then we went back to Candace's all dirty and shit.

That's enough about Friday...

Saturday: 
We wake up kinda late and we go to IHOP in our dirty ""mudding"" clothes.  It was cool.  We spend most of the day shopping and stuff.  We're supposed to take Amber back to college station later on.  We don't end up leavin' San Antonio til like almost 8pm.  So on our way there Am asked us if we wanted to stay there and go to a party with her.  Hell yeah!  So once we get to College Station she gets dressed and we're off to the party.  As soon as we get there I'm standin' by a car and I think I was messin' with my hair, cuz when I let my hand down it got cut on this car antenna that was broken.  I got a deep fuckin' cut.  It immediately started bleeding and it looked gross.  We go to the backyard, where the party is and we start walkin' around.  There are some pretty creative costumes.  They have this big block of ice and later I learn that it's the ""shot block""  So I meet some people...there's Nuttin, Eeyore, Booger, Disney, F'wagon...I start drinkin' immediately.  There's this orange juice mixed with something...I don't care what Candace said...it was STRONG.  I had 1 1/2 when Eeyore asked me to do the shot block with him. Fuck it...i've never done it but there's a first time for everything.  The first shot I take is Rum and it's...interesting.  The way the alcohol just goes down the ice and straight into ur mouth.  I go drink some more OJ stuff.  Later I challenge Eeyore again...so we go back to the shot block.  This time I have the Vodka.  I wasn't a big fan of it...I go back to my OJ.  I'm startin' to feel pretty good after about 4 of the OJ drinks and my 2 shots.  There's no more OJ stuff so what's a girl to do.  Start drinkin' beer of course.  I had Eeyore as my beer slave and he'd go get me beer.  I met this guy that looked like one of Candaces' Exes...I've never met the guy but it looked like him from the picture.  So I introduce myself then I tell him that he looks like this guy I've never met.  He was obviousely lost.  Oh...yes...everything that night...was hot. lol...for everything I'd say ""That's hot!""  Amber's room mate kinda ticked me off because she started talkin' about me like I wasn't there.  OK i was drunk...but dammit I still know you're talkin' about me.  She was like ""And where is she supposed to be stayin' tonight?  Yea...she's gonna sleep real well.""  OK granted the stuff wasn't horrible what she said...but just the way she said it...she coulds looked at me...but she completely failed to acknowledge my presence.  After about 4 beers...I'm startin' to not be able to control myself and the things I say.  Candace started playin' this game with this guy where if he guessed the Domino she had in her hand all three of us had to kiss him (Me, Am, n Candace).  I went to the bathroom and Candace then played by herself and she'd kiss him on the lips...the guys name was Fuck Wagon.  But everyone calls him F'wagon.  I don't remember who it was I told this to...I think I told it to more than one person.  But...Am was upset because her ""BF"" never LOOKED at her the whole party.  He was with some other girl.  I thought it was fucked up so I mentioned that to someone.  And I told them...""Look at her!  My sister is beautiful.  I'll tell you what...if she wasn't my sister...and if I were a lesbian...I'd want her!""  lol...i made such an ass outta myself.  Right before we left I had a cup of wine...i chugegd that shit down because they were makin' me leave.  Amber was drivin' and we had to ride in the back of a truck. There were like 6 or more ppl back there.  I looked and F'wagon and was like ""hey! I kissed you!"" and he goes...""yea! you did""  It was just on the cheek but yeah.  Then Eeyore was like ""Hey you didn't kiss me!""  So I don't remember this but I started makin' out with him.  Like I vaguely remember but I dont remember if he kissed good...or anything...lol  Candace said it was a long kiss too...like more than a minute.  I cannot believe that shit!!  Amber dropped us off at her dorm and said she'd be back cuz she had a truckful of ppl to drop off.  She gave us her ID so we could get into her dorm.  I tried to go into every other dorm building...then every other floor and then every other room that wasn't Ambers.  Once we got in Candace tried to look up directions to get back home.  I called everyone and made an ass of myself.  I left messages to like 3 different people.  Called my ex and I talked to him for like 1 minute...gave Candace the phone...and I was like ""Hey...who ya talkin' to? Is that Rufino??""  (another ex) OMG...it was just bad.  When we were goin' down the stairs I was runnin' down them and I'd tell Candace she'd better hurry up and open the door cuz I wasn't stoppin...  We get out to her car and I would NOT get in.  I still don't know how but I hit her door with my forehead and I have a big ass bump on my head...it HURTS!  I asked this guy that was walkin' by if he could help us get home.  I tried to ride away on a bike that was out there.  That's when Amber got back and whooped my ass into shape.  She was SO angry at me and made me stay in the car.  We left and I had to make Candace stop so I could throw up 2 times.  One of the times I saw a car full of guys and I was like ""Hey!!!""  Candace was like ""Crystal get in THE CAR!""  The guys yelled ""Hey"" at us and were startin' to turn around when I got in the car and Candace sped up.  In Bastrop after bein' lost for I dunno how long we got pulled over.  The police sirens wake me up...and when we stop I non challantly put on my seat belt.  lol.  He just gave Candace a warning because she failed to dim her lights.  He tried to give us more directions but we still got lost.  She called her sister because her sister lives in Round Rock and somehow she was able to get us to her house.  We stayed the ""mornin'"" there cuz it was like 6 am when we got there.  When I woke up at around 12 I was still fuckin' drunk.  Then my head started pounding.  It was bad.

Sunday:
We go eat with Candace's sister.  I make myself throw up and I feel a lil better.  But it doesn't help with the headache.  We go back to her place and she makes me some tea.  We head back home shortly after.  I sleep the whole way back with a blanket covering my eyes from the sun.  My headache won't go away and Candace was gonna make me go to a party with her at night.  We get here around 6 or so and I take a bubble bath then a hot shower.  Immediately I feel a million times better.  We get dressed for the party...ummm...yeah nothin' to say about the party.  It sucked...and...yeah...I've got nothin'.  OHH...the only cool thing was that I saw this guy that works with me and I've always thought he was soooooo hot...but yea he was there...and he was flirting with um...this guy dressed up as a cow    :(  Why are all the hot guys gay?!

So that was my weekend.  Prolly the best weekend I've ever had.  So what if it ended on a sucky note.  I still had a hella lotta fun!!"

"event","I woke up early...took a 40 minute shower...got dressed and went to church.  Church was eh...there's this girl there that is 17 I think.  She's friends with my 11 yr. old cousin.  She looks sooo incredibally conceited.  I was tellin' my aunt that and she said that she was one of the nicest ppl ever.  I said ""Maybe so, but she still comes across as conceited.""  She told me ""So do you...""  HOW RUDE!!  This is true tho, I guess I look down at ppl.  I don't mean to...not all the time anyway. lol...eh...if you don't like it get over it. :)

Same aunt was talkin' about this guy Edgar that lives in El Paso.  OK...REWIND 3 or 4 YEARS...I was at a debut with all my family.  A GORGEOUS GUY walks in and says HI to my aunt Lisa and uncle Marc.  His name is Edgar at the time he's I think 23.  He works with Lisa and she introduces him to everyone.  He looks at me and we just completely gaze into each others eyes for a while.  He gives me this cute smile.  That night I kept carrying one of my cousins.  My crazy aunt told me to put him down because ppl were going to think he was mine.  Particulary Edgar.  The whole night he'd look at me and smile.  I was like SCORE!!! MY UNCLE APPROVES OF HIM...HELL YES!  So a bunch of us are dancing and then somehow it ends up bein' just the 2 of us.  We talk a while and he tells me I have a beautiful son.  Damn my aunt she was right!  Of course I clear that shit up real fast!  So we go back to the table...and I'm tellin my mom I'm thirsty.  She tells me to go buy a soda...I'm about to go when he goes...""No, here have some of this.""  And he gives me some of his wine cooler.  I get a lil bit since my family is all around me...and give it to him and say ""Thanks""  he says ""No go ahead...keep it""  I smile but my uncle (the one that KNOWS and LIKES Edgar) grabs it away from me and tells him...""Hey man chill out she's only 16"" (maybe I was 17) He looks at me and says ""OH!  I didn't know...""  He didn't talk to me AT ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT!!! :(  Later later I find out he moves to El Paso, he gets married and has a kid.  He opens his own day care...I never thought too much more about him after that...
Back to today...Lisa was talkin' about wanting to go to El Paso and she tells me ""OH, by the way Sissy.  He never married that girl, they had a kid but she doesn't talk to him anymore!""  I HAVE A CHANCE!!! lol!  I reminded Marc how he screwed up my ""game"" because he told him I was underage.  And he said ""That's kind of a good thing to know.""  I said ""Nah, my mom wouldn't have pressed charges.""  
So it's quiet for a while...and I break the silence with...the most natural thing I could think of.  ""Hey Lis, let's go to El Paso!""  :)  This man is beautiful, he's a hard worker.  He loves kids!  I want him. lol

Edgar's hot!  Way hot :)  I gotta find the pic that I took with him and my uncle that night.
Otay...I'm tired of typing man, so I'm gonna go...night"

I did everything you're supposed to do in a movie.  Including, of course, make fun of Hilary Duff to piss my brother off.  I didn't think she could pull something like this off, but she did.  Like, all her movies are alright...corny, but cute.  I didn't think this one was corny at all.

Candace...once again...I will deny all of this when you bring it up to my brother!! And if you do...then...I'll just have to remind him that um, you owe him a game of Life and 20 dollars for betting against him during a BASKETBALL game! :)

"event","Hey y'all.  How's it goin'?  I've been doing pretty good.  Not too much to complain about this time around :)

So, I'm seein' this guy right?  His name is Luis...I think I already touched base on this on my last entry.  Candace went out with the 2 of us on Monday night.  He bought her 2 BIG HUGE drinks (MY date spent more money on my friend than on me...:(...lol jk, it was all good)  I couldn't really drink because I was driving.  It was so funny to watch Candace down these 2 drinks that were bigger than MY head let along hers.  I helped her a lil...but not much.  Maaaan...I know where I wanna go for my 21st birthday and I'm gonna make everyone that goes with me buy me one of them drinks.  They were really good.

So anyway...leave it to me to bring something good to an end.  It hasn't really come to an end but I've been going back and forth on a particular issue.  Ok, I say I don't believe in love anymore...so it's ok that I'm havin' fun with this guy...and later if something happens between us, if we decide we really really like eachother and end up fallin' in love...then cool.  But deep down I still long for that ""you know when you meet the person you're going to marry"" kinda thing.  The first look, first kiss magic.  I want that.  As much as I tell myself I don't.  OK...like I don't believe it will happen to me, but I still HOPE and DREAM that it will...y'know.  DO I MAKE ANY SENSE?!  And like Ione Skye said in Dream For An Insomniac ""Anything less than mad, passionate, extraordinary love is a waste of your time.  The world is full of mediocre things, and love shouldn't be one of them.""  So what do I do??  Do I continue seeing this guy?  Cuz this is what I'm thinking...what if I decide not to see him anymore?  He COULD be the love of my life and I'm missing out just because it didn't happen ""at first sight.""  Then again, say I do start something serious with him...and THEN I meet the man of my dreams.  That's not going to be very fair.  It might be too late.  AHHH...Why do I overanalyze things????  *sigh*  I think I just need to chill out and live life moment by moment.  I'm tired of just sitting and waiting for Mr. Right.  So...I'm going to continue seeing Luis.    I pretty much knew that I was going to continue seeing him...but this argument has been goin' on in my head since I got off of work and I just needed to lay it out so I could see it in black and white.  

Work was...eh...there.  It was pretty cool because Mike (""Q"") my manager, was the one in charge of the MOD squad meeting today.  And when we were talkin' about the bilingual standards he said that the call center manager said something along the lines of ""we have to keep the standards between our best spanish rep, which is Crystal, and the person with the highest cpt"" And then later in the night we held meetings with 2 people I needed to mentor.  And he just told them that he doesn't expect them to be where I'm at right now because I have an excellent CPT but they need to lower theirs.  I LOVE when he says things like that.  It makes him so much more hotter to me. lol

Ok...enough for today.  I need to get some sleep since my brother is making me take him watch *gag* Riase Your Voice with Hilary Scruff.  Cyall later :)"

"event","I haven't been able to update lately because I was involved in a top secret FBI experiment.  To make a LONG story short...I spent a few days in space visiting with the aliens and communicating their living habits with the gov't.

So I just wanted to update today just to let y'all know that everything went well.  I still haven't been able to figure out why one day while in space I took a nap and when I woke up EVERYONE had a big smile on their face...and after that ANYTIME I would clean my ears they'd laugh and beg me to go back to sleep.  Hmmm?

So...yeah...BOYS SUCK!  ESPECIALLY YOU RUFINO!!!!  I swear I'll be able to stop talkin' to him fo' sho' this time.  He pissed me off!!  I hadn't talked to him in almost a month.  First my phone was disconnected...then his.  Last night I called and he finally had it back on.  He was playin' pool so I told him I'd call him back during my break.  I didn't, but I called him when I got off of work.  He was on his way to work and he asked how work had gone. I told him it was fine but there were a lot of haters.  He PERSISTED on askin' why so I explained to him that since I mentor a lot of ppl see that I'm off the phone and they're jealous.  He says ""I guess.""  HELLO he was the one that PERSISTED!!!!  Then I asked him how playin' pool went.  He said it was alright.  I asked him if he had gotten any booty (because I heard a girl in the background...) and he said no.  So JOKINGLY I said ""that sucks!""  He says ""I GUESS"" (with the emphasis on GUESS).  He pissed me off even more so I said ""You know what I'll just talk to you some other time."" And I hung up on him.  Why is he like that???  If he doesn't care then just say so.  I don't wanna talk to him if he finds me boring...y'know?

Yeah...that's why I'm hatin' boys right now.  Except for one...one isn't so bad right now.  In fact he makes me feel good.  He thinks I'm beautiful :)"

"event","Yeah...so I disappeared again.  Eh...you'll get over it.

I haven't talked to Rufino in...umm...almost 2 weeks.  Mainly because my phone is off right now so I can't call him.  It's cool though, I don't want to call him.  When I call him all I get is more and more confused.

My cousin Nick is making a bad decision.  I'll take it to my grave, but just had to get it out there that I'm kinda scared for him.

There's this gay guy at work...can't remember if I mentioned him before.  Anyway...the other day he told me I was his new best friend due to my hair and my ridiculously gorgeous face.  Made me feel good.  Don't know why but it just seems so much better comin' from a gay guy. LOL

This past week my mom was off of work, and we were really cool.  We got along real well the whole week.  Hopefully things stay that way.

On the 16th it would have been my grandpa's 75th birthday so we went to the cemetary for a while.  Me and my mom went with my uncle Marc and my baby, Annabella.  It was really weird...I mean she knows nothing of what a cemetary is or why we were going.  She's only 2 1/2.  Buy anyway on our way to the cemetary COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE she started singing ""Happy Birthday.""  We were in shock.

I spent all Sunday at my grammas house.  We went over after church and didn't leave til about 8 or so.  I missed havin' one of those Sundays.  Church then get together as a family.  The way it should be.

If you know me or talk to me on messanger you prolly have already heard of this video...but if not...go check it out!  http://www.ccb.ufsc.br/~anselmo/12062004/01.htm  this is the greatest video in the world.  I love it!

"event","So Rufino and I were doing well for a while.  I was really happy.  I didn't care about all the other shit that was going on BECAUSE I was happy.  Then he completely closed off, as he'd done so many other times before.  Pisses me off.  All of a sudden when I call he's asleep so we barely talk.  God I hate him but I love him.

""Shut up, come back, No- I didn't really mean to say that.  I'm mixed up, so what.  Yeah you want me so you're messed up too.  I love you!  I hate you! If you only knew what I've been through.""  ""Love Me For Me"" -Ashlee Simpson

Anyway, I've also been thinkin' about a certain someone who I screwed up with.  He was really nice to me, but I got scared off.  I started to ignore him.  I don't understand why girls are so evil.  I say I wouldn't hurt anyone intentionally...but would I?  I don't deserve anyone...I deserve to be treated like shit.  I guess you could say I'm getting what I deserve.  I really confuse myself sometimes.  Sometimes I'm like ""what did I do to Rufino to make him not care? To make him treat me like shit and only talk to me whenever he fuckin' feels like it??"" Then I get to thinking ""I'm gettin' what I deserve I'm reaping what I sow""  I still think there's something wrong with me.  I feel like I might be pushin away some ppl that really care about me.  But tryin' to hold on to ppl who need to move on with their lives.  I also think I would do well to see someone...about this I mean.  Sometimes I go from one extreme to another.  I'm happy one minute and pissed and depressed the next minute.

I'm content right now.  Don't know how long it will last.  But I'm happy.  I'm thankful to God that he helped us with our car situation.  My mom got a Nissan Sentra and it's a type R.  It's a 2003 with 9000 miles.  Whoever had it already had a pretty bad ass system in it.  It's really nice. So my mom's pimpin' it. She THINKS I'm not gonna learn how to drive a 6 speed..OH BUT I WILL.  And I will smoke everyones ass that wants to fuck with me.  

I went to Austin' on Sunday with Yamairah.  I'm REALLY REALLY sorry Pio (if you still even read this).  I know I said I was planning to go to Austin but I was already there.  I wanted to meet up with you, but for 2 reasons I didn't.  One was because I was with Yamairah and I didn't know if she'd be cool with it.  There were times where I'd put you on mute to see if Yamairah would say ""why don't you just tell him to meet us...""  And 2 because we were high and bein' completely stupid.

And here goes another apology.  Candace sorry I didn't tell you that I had gotten high.  I know I told you we'd planned on it.  But anyway...I never really had a chance to talk to you the times you called...and online when you asked me how austin had gone I was in an in depth convo with Amber so...If you come over tomorrow I'll tell you everything that really happened in Austin.

On Saturday I got to see Amber because it was her birthday and she was in town.  Since she turned 18 she went to get a tattoo.  It's a cute tattoo.  And when I go get my tattoo I'm gonna go to this same lady.  Bachi is GREAT :)

Anyway I don't think I have any other bull shit to talk about right now.  So I'm gonna go."

"event","So I called Rufino tonight...just for the hell of it.  Didn't think he'd answer.  Well he did and you can tell he'd been sleeping, naturally I thought this would be one of our many 2 minute conversations.  Wrong!  We spoke for 30 minutes.  The longest we'd talked in over 3 or 4 months prolly.  They're not comin' to San Antonio after all.  They're goin' to Austin.  Wants me to go see him but I can't go Saturday because that's Amber's Birthday and she's coming back into town for the weekend.   And they're leaving early Sunday morning.  UNLESS they do really well then they'll prolly leave at 5 or 6 pm.  He was showing his kind Rufino side again.  The side that makes me have hope.  I don't know what to fuckin' do.  We talked about a lot of stuff.  Like how I'm gonna be alone, how I can't make anyone happy because I never seem to be enough for anyone.  He let me know he cared...and he just listened.  He brought up the night that we met...I brought up the night he told me he loved me.  ""I still do love you"" he said.  I guess it's a different kinda love now.  So it was good because he just made me happy, and he gave me hope.  But on the other hand...this wasn't good precisely BECAUSE he gave me hope, I'm more than likely holdin' onto something that I don't need to be holdin' on to.  And it's also bad because him being nice doesn't help me get over him any sooner.  Not once did he mention me having sex with him if I DO go up to Austin.

I swear guys are confusing as all mother fuckin' hell! AHHHHHHH!!!

Crap, I'm fallin' asleep here at the computer.  I guess that means I should prolly get to bed, y'think?

Anyway...that's not my point!  My point is...I have a friend in Vegas.  Ok, I'm gonna stray away from the point real quick while I tell you about Mike (no, not my manager).  Mike is 39 I think...married with 3 kids.  I met him about 5 years ago on the net.  We've talked ever since...It's not an everyday thing.  We just let eachother know we're still alive every once in a while.  SOOO...back to my point.  I had told Mike that I wanted to take my mom up there for our bdays.  Well he called me today, hadn't heard from him in a while.  He asked if I was still plannin' on going to Vegas, told him I thought so.  Then he said that if I ever needed to just get away fly up to Vegas and he'd set me up in the Bellagio.  Not Circus Circus...not...any ol' hotel.  THE BELLAGIO! Not quite the Palms...but the next best thing.  And that he'd take me to a few shows and show me around town.  I was like HELL YEAH dude!  I just might think about that.  Wouldn't you?!  Get away from the stress for a while, and just be pampered!  So what if he's married...I'm not gonna sleep with him!  

Enough about that...I cut my hair yesterday.  I did it myself...lol  And when I looked at the back in the mirror I saw it was crooked, so I just pulled the part that was longer and brought my other hand around my back and just cut some more. I didn't think it was that bad, esp since my hair is curly so it looks different lenghts anyway.  Eh, well.  It was really pissing me off cuz the ends were HORRIBLE.  I think I ended cutting like 2 or 3 inches off.

My moms gonna go get her hair done today, I should prolly go with her so they can straighten out my hair, plus I need to get my roots done.  BUT I have no money.  Maybe I can con my mom into payin' for me :)  

Alright...I gotta take Ernie to school pretty soon so I guess I'll go mosey about the house.

"event","I guess you could kind of say I got bored of writing for a while.  It just happens sometimes y'know?  Eh...
So my best friend is gone.  What am I saying?  She's more than my best friend...shes my sister.  She's in College Station, gettin' ready for college, and gettin' ready to get her career started.  She wants to do PR for the Spurs.  When I took her to say goodbye to my aunts yesterday my aunt Lisa was like ""When I get on my feet, I'm gonna help you out."" And then my uncle Marc gave her a big hug and said ""Make us proud, I know you will!"" I thought that was great, they really do see her as part of the family.  She's comin' back on the 3rd, because her bday is the 4th.  But the fact that I can't just go over to talk to her is hard to deal with right now.  I still have her mom THANK GOD.  She's my escape from my real mom.  I'll still prolly go over there every weekend when moms not working.  

Works been alright.  Mike was kinda disappointed in me because Quality called and told him that I sounded bored and uninterested.  Well guess WHAT...I WAS!  He said he shouldn't be gettin' a call like this about someone he just made a mentor.  Which is true.  :(  They hadn't failed me on any calls, so I prolly still will get my 5th 100 in a row next week.  He just called to give me a heads up, he was settin' up to listen to me and thats when he said I sounded bored.  So when I got back on the phones from talkin' to Mike I kissed ass on the phones.  The good thing about work, is that starting this week I only work Tuesday through Friday.  I'm gonna have 3 days off from now on!!! Yeyeah!
This is good, that way I can take off to College Station for a weekend whenever I feel like it.  Marc and Lisa wanted to go visit her whenever Lisa can get time off from work.

I bought the Ashlee Simpson CD! It's great!  I love it...
I think my favorite songs are Shadow and Lala.
Here are some lyrics to Lala...
""You can dress me up in diamonds
You can dress me up in dirt
You can throw me like a lineman
I like it better when it hurts
Oh I have waited here for you
I have waited
You make me wanna lala in the kitchen on the floor
I'll be a french maid when I meet you at the door
I'm an alley cat
Drink the milk up I want more
You make me wanna
You make me wanna scream""
Hahah...it's a great song.  She's so different from Jessica...I think I like her better too.  Shadow is a really pretty song too.  But I'll spare lyrics since I think they play it on the radio.

Oh, and I'd like to say thank you to Candace.  I'm now addicted to Fill-it-Ins.  Butthole!
Hmm...I think I'm gonna go do a Fill-it-In right now.  See y'all losers later!"

Anyway, I've been incredibally stressed out!  I mean HORRIBLY!  I also developed a lump at my jaw, like right under my earlobe.  But as some smart person said, it was prolly stress related.  Well I'm guessing so because it's gone now.  Thank you God!
I think I'm gonna go look for a second job.  It's the only long run solution that I can think of.  Other than winning the lottery of course. 

Enough about money!  

It seems the only thing that HAS been going good in my life is my job.  On Wednesday night I got pulled off the phones by the overnight ACCM (assistant call center manager) so I thought I was in HUGE trouble.  He told me to meet him in the conference room, so I go and more ppl start coming in.  3 other ppl that aren't trouble makers at all so I was relieved.  It's a meeting about bein' a member of the MOD Squad.  MOD stands for Mentors On Demand.  So basically we are now mentors.  We're gonna help ppl bring their CPT down or their Quality up.  So I was pretty psyched.  He said we were going to get company wide recognition that would definately help out if we wanted to move into management or something.  I'm one step away from becoming a lead! Yay!!!  The fact that I'm the only bilingual member of the MOD Squad and that we could definately use another bilingual team lead is even more brownie points for me.

The other good thing about work is...well...Mike.  LOL.  We have started flirting a HELLA lot!  Damn, if that boy wasn't married I'd...well...um...he prolly wouldn't be as interesting to me. lol.  Today I went over to his desk and asked what the deal was with some other guy bein' employee of the month.  I told him ""this isn't what we agreed on...""  and he said ""Well you haven't held up your end of the bargain!"" 
""And what would that be?""  And since my team lead was standin' there with him, he just started twirling his bottle of lotion.  I don't think I updated on how bad we flirted last week, but he basically wanted me to give him a rubdown with lotion. So I just kinda laughed and walked over to the team board to look at our stats. Once Michelle left (the team lead) I went back over to him.
""So, tell me again why I wasn't Employee of the Month?""
""Well we were lookin' for most improvement...and...""
""Oh what...I haven't improved?!  Can we look at my attendance patterns from the past please?!""
""Well we just thought he needed a lil extra push to be where you're currently at.  But I (emphasis on I)can give you a push too..."" ::evil smile::

**more blushing**

I asked him if I could mentor someone cuz I was bored and just like that he said ""you have to show some more cleavage first...""
""I can't be showin' my goods to everyone!""
""I didn't say you had to show them to EVERYONE!""

*BLUSHING ONCE AGAIN*

I was bein' nosey lookin' through his file folders and I found some stickers that you can color.  I asked him if I could have them and he said ""I'll stick you...""
Then he went into serious mode cuz he was listening to someones calls.
So I asked him again if I could have them and he said yeah.  
Just to make sure I asked if he was going to make me to something to keep the stickers and he got a big smile on his face and ignored the person takin' calls...""Well now that you mention it..."" and he grabbed for the stickers.  But I just laughed and walked away before he could take them from me.

This all happened within a period of 5 minutes...I kid you not!

When I went back to my desk I was fannin' myself and my friend was like ""what??""  
I didn't tell her though.  I don't need ppl to start rumors.

BUT DAMN!

SO yeah...Mike's hot! :) 

But yeah...Mike's married! lol

Oh...BTW...his wife is pregnant with baby number 4 :)

As a closing note, I would just like to say...Thank You Jason.  Thank you for being you.  Thank you for making me feel that ppl would miss me if I were gone.  And that what I was planning on doing was selfish.  I don't wanna ever think about doing what I wanted to do a few nights ago.  It's horrible to feel you have no escape except the most EXTREME of them all.

Goodbye all!"

"event","And now
The end is near
And so I face
The final curtain
My friend
I'll say it clear
I'll state my case
Of which I'm certain
I've lived
A life that's full
I've traveled each 
And every highway
And more
Much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets
I've had a few
But then again
Too few to mention
I did
What I had to do
And saw it through 
Without exemption
I planned
Each charted course
Each careful step
On the biway
And more
Much more than this
I did it my way

Yes there were times
I'm sure you knew
When I bit off
More than I could chew
But through it all
When there was doubt
I ate it up
And spit it out
I've faced it all
And I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved
I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill
My share of losing
And now
As tears subside
I find it all
So amusing
To think
I did all that
And may I say
Not in a shy way
Oh no
Oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man
What has he got
If not himself
Then he has not
To say the things
He truly feels
And not the words 
Of one who kneels
The record shows
I took the blows 
And did it my way

Yes it was my way
-Frank Sinatra
His greatest song ever!  I recommend you download it, the way he sings it has a lot to do with the greatness of the song.  Some of the lyrics might be wrong cuz I did it the old fashioned way.  My stupid computer won't let me get the lyrics."

Enjoy people. Don't have much to say except Sunday I FINALLY got to spend time with my aunt Gladys and uncle Alex.  They are the coolest people in the world.  They're awesome! 
I'm stressed, more stressed than I've ever been.  I don't know when it will go away.  And I've picked up a disgusting habit.  I'm sure you ppl can put 2 and 2 together.  Stressed...disgusting habit.  Blah!  
Amber leaves in 2 weeks for college.  Really sucks.  I'm gonna go pick her up the 4th of Sept. though because it's her bday and she doesn't wanna spend it overthere.  Anyway, I think that's the reason I've been stayin' away from her, because it's gonna be really hard if we're as close as we were last summer and then she just leaves.  We're still close, but like if I keep my distance it'll be easier.  Today we spent all day together though.  I REALLY missed bein' lazy at her house.  
Anyway...I'm gonna go. 
I leave you people with some words of wisdom.

"event","Finally got ahold of Rufino this mornin'.  I talked to him for about 2 minutes.  I'm satisfied though.  I got a dose of his voice so I'll be fine today.  It's tomorrow when I don't hear from him that everything starts all over again.  He's my drug, I know it's not good, I know it's not healthy, but I'm addicted.  I won't every be completely happy, I'll never be completely pain free until I can get rid of him in my thoughts.  Right now talkin' to him just temporarily eases the pain.

Eh...

So last night Yamairah and Keith came over, I talked to them for about 10 minutes because I had to go to work.  As much as I don't agree with a lot of the things Yamairah does or DID, I can't hold it against them.  I'm no one's judge.  I do remember the fun times though.  We used to have fun goin' out, the 4 of us.  The Clan Loopy.  LOOPairah, LOOPeith, ambLOOPer, and LOOPistal.  I miss those days.  I have almost no doubt in my head that Amber will never talk to them again, but I also have a pretty good feeling that I will relive those past times.  No matter what may have happened Yamairah and I have been friends for 15+ years.  We stopped bein' friends once before when we were in elementary.  Then middle school brought us back together.  Even if I tried to deny it, she was a big part of my life.  And we prolly won't go back to be best friends like we used to be, but we can be close friends.  We'll see what happens.

I'm really tired.  I don't know why I've been so tired lately.  Tuesday I slept a total of 15 hours!  That's madness.  When I woke up my eyes were so incredibally puffy.

Mike (my manager) called me some word that means ""conceited"" or ""stuck on yourself"".  Don't ask me what the word was it was a ""guamanian"" word (I know thats not the language they speak but i forget what it's called...tagalag or something????)  But yeah, he was lookin' at the pics I have on my phone, and like 5 of them are of me, so he called me that.  HOW RUDE!  My family says I'm conceited, he said it, and Amber said I'm high maintenance.  Come to think of it Keith called me high maintenance once also.  *sigh* Am I really people?!

OK, I think that's enough of an update.  Are we happy now Candace?!  Hmm?? You better comment dammit I didn't update for nothin, ya hurrrd me?!"

"event","Hey y'all...
Just got home from work.  It was a long night, not TOO bad of a night, just long.  I got the grossest call from this guy.  It was in spanish, he was askin' for a sexually explicit chatline.  I told him we didn't have anything listed as that and so he was like ""well dear, I can't cum...""  ::eww cringe::  then he said what I KNEW was comin' ""do you think you could help me cum?""  I transferred him and as soon as my manager picked up he hung up.  My friend got his call like 10 times.  Anyway, he made me sick, my stomach started hurtin' after I got the call.

Last night I went to pick up my mom from a gas station, she had gone out with her friend Cindy, she called, it sounded like she was havin' fun and it sounded like she wouldn't be home til late.  At around 8 she calls and asks me to go pick her up from an Exxon.  So I went and when I got there I asked her what had happened.  First of all she was drunk...so she tells me that Cindy pissed her off.  I asked why and she said ""just because...""

Quiet...

""She was mad because I was dancin' with some people.  I was dancin' with an old man and she was mad that men were buying us drinks because of me.  She kept sayin' she wanted to leave so I told her to drop me off here.  Then she got mad because I called you and she said 'why are you calling them?  now they're gonna be more mad at me'  I told her I knew how expensive gas was and she said that had nothing to do with anything.""

Quiet...

""She was mad because I was talkin' to some ppl whose last name was Galvan.  It was a man and his wife and I had to go sit with her because she was off sittin' by herself like a little baby.  She wouldn't go sit with me and the Galvan's.""

Quiet...

""I don't have to put up with her shit...""

Quiet...

So yeah...that's what happened.  I thought it was pretty funny.  Cindy is a big baby.  And I've never really liked her, but all of a sudden she says me and Ernie don't like her because when my mom goes out with her they stay out late.  Maybe Ernie, but that's kid shit man.  I don't like her cuz she's a fuckin' baby.  A naggin' baby at that.

My mom is sooo incredibally hilarious when she's drunk.  I wish she acted that way all the time, without the alcohol though y'know.  When she gets real drunk it never fails she's in bed at night cryin' and moanin' sayin' she's gonna die and that we're not gonna miss her when she's gone.  Ernie gets so scared, as I USED to.  She hasn't gotten drunk in a LOOOOOOONG time, she deserves a few ""forget about EVERYTHING and get drunk"" nights every now and then.  Esp now that she's pretty much payin' all my bills til I get caught up.  Hopefully I can get caught up and save money to be able to take her to Vegas for OUR birthdays.

Anyway, that's it for now.  I'm gettin' kinda tired.  Hope y'all have a good day.  Ciao

SPEAKING OF CIAO...I just met one of the most gorgeous Italian guys.  He was HOT.  Like a mix between Luke Wilson and um...Mario Lopez.  B-E-A-Utiful!!  Don't know where he went though, he's not online anymore. :(  I meet the man of my dreams and he disappears.  Guess I'll have to go to Rome and look for him. :) Yay! Road...er...umm...Road/Plane trip!!!"

Wow, I sound like a total dweeb.  Anyway hope y'all are well.  I had to go into work last night and I'm still OH SO tired.  Something kinda cool happened at work though.  Mike Q (my sexy guamanian)was promoted from team lead to manager.  So he is officially my manager.  He used to just do manager things because our real manager has been out since um...like the beginning of the year.  So Brisa, Mike and I were talkin' about it up at the Q desk.  Then Brisa made some comment about me bein' his team lead.  I was like ""hell yeah dude, that'd be awesome!""  Mike was totally for it just said that I had to get off my corrective actions which is really just my final for attendance.  I've been doin' good on that though, so as soon as they post an opening I'm gonna apply for it.  He said he would put in a good word for me too. :)  Yay!  I would love to be a team lead...better yet, I would love to be Mike's team lead :)  LOL

I'm tired and my eyes hurt.  I got around 5 or 6 hours of sleep, but since it wasn't uninterrupted sleep I don't think was as great.  Maybe I'll be able to sleep like 2 more hours before work.  *yawn*  I better go check on the chicken wings.  And then to sleep I will go.  Hope y'all have a gahreat day.  TTFN"

We got a pizza to go and fries from Wing Stop.  I was tellin' Candace about a REALLY funny Will & Grace episode and that SOMEHOW reminded her that she wanted to buy one of the Friends Seasons on DVD.  So we go to Wal Mart and act stupid for a while.  We (when I say we I mean SHE since she had the money) bought some sippie cups.  Yeah the ones the kids use OK?!  They were Pink and Purple Princess ones so they were cute :)  Then we needed something to drink IN the sippie cups so we bought 2 bottles of wine.  I finished mine and I didn't feel any different.  I think she only served herself once.  She made me swear I wouldn't fall asleep during Friends but here I am and where is she?!  On my couch...ASLEEP!  We laughed pretty hard though and didn't really feel up to goin' to Graham's.  So all was good.  

We laughed really hard at this one episode where Phoebe wants to give Monica her grammas chocolate chip cookie recipe.  But the recipe got burned when her apt. cought on fire so all she had left was one cookie that she was able to make from some batter that she had frozen.  She gives it to Monica and Mon tries to figure out the recipe by tastin' the cookie.  So she ends up makin' like over 20 batches.  FINALLY they give up and ask Phoebe if maybe her gramma has some relatives in France that she got the recipe from.  It clicks in Phoebe's head that her gramma once told her she got the recipe from HER gramma who's name was (I'm gonna try to spell it the way she said it) Neslay Toolhous.  Monica freaks and throws her a bag of Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chips and asks Phoebe if the recipe on the back is the recipe, it was...we were rollin' on the floor laughin', I guess you had to watch it to REALLY get the full effect. lol

Oh...my freakin' manager called me today while I was out, so when I called back he was like WHERE ARE YOU?!  Hello...IM OFF!  He said that today wasn't an excused day, I was only excused for yesterday.  I got on his ass because when I asked him if my days had gotten approved he said all but Friday and Sat.  So when I asked for documentation he said he didn't have my paper but he'd show me the email.  Now he's tellin' me that since I asked for paid time off on Tues and unpaid time off on Wed. it was a DIFFERENT email and he STILL hadn't gotten anything back.  What the hell?!  I submitted that shit way before 2 weeks ahead of time and on the DAY OF they still don't have word?!  That's GAY!  But Brisa was gonna excuse me because she got my back.  Pisses me off though.  It's not Mikes fault it's HRs fault.  They expect us to give them 2 weeks notice but they don't have any regards on gettin' to US with enough time.  AHHHH!!  Anyway, like I said I'm safe, but Mike was like ""if I get word that you told someone we excused you it's yo' ass girl!""  PUH LEASE...Brisa always does favors for me and I never say anything.  Anyway, that's my mini rant!  

I think I'm gonna go night night now.  Hope y'all have a good day!  And I LOVE the way y'all all asked me 5 questions!  Y'all suck people! SUCK I TELL YA!

I need to go buy that movie, it's absolutely fantastic!

Today hopefully we can go to Graham's, we had planned to go but they're showin' Alisa's perfomance on TV today (Channel 13 [KSAT12] at 7pm I think)on Gimme The Mike!

"event","Hey y'all.  How's it goin'?  
My day was uneventful as usual, just the way I like 'em. lol.  I slept a good portion of the day.  I had a full house today, my cousin Spencer spent the night, so him and Ernie played basketball and PS2 all day.  Then in the mornin' my uncle Marc brought Carlee and Annabella over.  Annabella didn't take a nap all day and her mom told me that she hadn't gone to sleep til 3am the previous mornin', so I was hopin' she'd take a long nap.  Well she fell asleep at around 10 and we figured she would sleep through the night.  Nope she woke up at 1.  So, she's awake right now watchin' The Lion King 1 1/2 for the 3rd time tonight.  While she was sleepin' me Ernie and Carlee were playin' Phase 10, then we played a ghetto version of Scattegories.  We drank pickle juice with lucas (the aftershock was the same as when I took my first shot of tequila) and when our stomachs started hurtin' I suggested we take turns spinnin' eachother around in the computer chair til we puked they didn't think it was a very good idea.  Shot down by a coupla 11 year olds.  Way to go Crystal! :)
Awww...my babies sittin on my lap right now...she was yellin' for me ""THITHER!!"" And when I went to go get her she kept sayin' ""Hug"" thats what she wants when she wants to be carried.  lol she's lookin' at everything I type like she can read. hehe
So anyway...I hope one day I can have my own kiddos, but I've been told that I needa have sex first.  And to have sex you need a man.  I DONT HAVE ONE OF THOSE and I don't think I ever will have one. So...lol I guess I'm screwed.  Unless that is God performs another miracle. :)

I think Annabella has my same fetish with tape.  She always tries to steal my tape!  How rude!  For those of you that don't know, a friend of mine got me addicted to rollin' tape.  In a weird way it calms me down.  I just roll the tape into a tiny tube and roll it back and fort between my fingers.  (Now Annabella's tryin' to wax my arms with the tape...good thing there's nothing there otherwise I'd be in pain lol)

Umm...I'm not too tired but I think I should try to get some sleep so maybe (hopefully) Annabella falls asleep with me.  So...I'm gonna steal the idea from a friend of mine (Neron)and make all of you that read this ask me questions.  Only I'm wantin' y'all to ask me 5 question...ANYTHING that y'all want...instead of 3.  

They better be original DAMMIT...:)
Goodbye

P.S...
Annabella has my Princess watch on and she tore Cinderellas head off...so I pretended to cry (not the crying you do Candace) and she was patting my face sayin' ""Don't cry bibi..."" lol it was the cutest thing:)"

"event","So, as you may know I've had a few shitty days here lately.  But I think things are starting to get better.  I know I have my mom's help.  She gave me a check for the truck payment today.  And then before I had to leave for work she gave me 5 dollars.  No clue why, I guess that's my allowance for the week. Lol.  Um...I have officially started my vacation. GOOD NEWS.  My mom isn't takin' hers til the last week before Ernie goes back to school.  So we WON'T kill eachother.
I'm sittin' here listenin' to some Pesado songs.  Their website has like 3 or 4 songs from each of their CDs. Yay!!  http://www.pesado.com.mx/default.htm  I love them so much.  If you go to the website the guy in the middle is the one that reminds me of Jose...like I said NOT cute, but SEXY to ME!  They bring back nothing but memories from Mexico, granted some are sad but for some reason any memory from Mexico is a relief.  So far those are the years that I was happiest.  The years that I will forever remember and miss so much that it makes you wanna cry hoping I could relive those days.  I can't even explain the happiness that being in Mexico brought me.  It was great overthere.  I guess I can TRY to paint a picture of what went on.

My Typical Day in Mexico....

I'd wake up around noon, possibly earlier depending on what we did the night before.  I would come downstairs greeted by some MAD home cooking.  We're talkin' home made flour tortillas and all.  While lunch was bein' made if we were outta soda's my aunt would send me, or Ernie to the corner store with about 3 or 4 glass bottles.  The returnable coke bottles, those are the sodas they have over there(they TASTE a lot better BTW).  We'd walk to the store cuz it's like 2 minutes away if you walk.  Plus I always felt safe there, everyone knew us in the neighborhood.  We scored points because my uncle was a cop and my cousin Paco (about 30 years old now) was respected and feared by everyone, so everyone knew not to fuck with us.  To top it off we were from ""the other side.""  So we were cool, people always wanted us to be sayin' things in English so they could hear what we talked like.  Anyway, back to my day.  We'd go home and eat lunch.  Afterward my cousin Karina would clean the kitchen and I'd sit in there (if I felt REAL nice I'd help her)with her and we would talk.  We never ran outta things to talk about.  She had so many things to tell me, adventures with Jose, or other guys.  She just had a lot to say.  So, after kitchen duty she would clean the living room.  I would sit on couch and just look outside, often you could hear the music from someones car (if they were cleaning or washing their car).  Or I'd watch the kids play outside.  Then when my cousin really got into her cleaning she'd turn the stereo on.  My passion, OUR passion was to listen to the stereo full blast.  Pesado, Intocable, El Poder del Norte.  Those were all favorite groups.  I would just sit on the couch lookin' out the screen door, hoping to catch a glimpse of Jose's truck drive by.  He lived 3 houses to the left of my cousin.  And if i was lucky enough to see his truck my cousin would turn and look at me after he passed by, I would just smile.  After she was done mopping we'd go sit on the porch and wait for the living room to dry.  If no one was home she'd smoke a cigarette, if there were people home we would just sit on the rocking chairs outside and talk some more.  Then she would clean the porch. This consisted of pouring water everywhere and mopping.  That was always fun, sometimes we'd get carried away and have water fights.  It would get very slippery because the floor was all ceramic tile.  A light green and white marble looking tile, through their WHOLE house, this was the tile that was used.  Sometimes we'd see Ivan across the street cleanin' his brothers car or sittin' on the porch with him family doin' the same thing, just talkin' with his family.  After that we'd go inside and watch TV usually some soap operas.  Usually we'd fall asleep and we would wake up when they were makin' dinner.  (We usually only ate one meal in Mexico...not becuase that's all there was, but because we had better things to do)  Once we woke up we would start gettin' dressed, and for some reason it took the two of us from about 6 til about 9pm to get dressed.  Once we were dressed we'd go outside, and then everyone came to us.  Ivan, Laura, Sergio, Monica, Tony, Jose, Luis, Carlos, Pito, sometimes Tere and Raul.  We would go to the park on the corner or we would all sit on the porch, just talkin' and bein' stupid.  When it was a party night we would stay out til about 6 AM.  The parties were usually held at our house or at Tony's house.  Sittin' around, drinkin', listening to music.  And when my cousin and Ivan would get real drunk Ivan would put an arm around Karina and they would sing the sad songs that were on real loud.  When ppl started gettin' drunk we'd switch the music to nothing but sad music, like Ramon Ayala, Vicente Fernandez, or Los Cadetes.  Usually the last 3 people out were me, Karina and Ivan.  I really miss the days spend at the park.  It was just a bunch of friends doing nothin' but laughin' knockin' off and havin' fun.  I would do anything for one more of those days.  Anything.  It seems everyone's grown apart now.  My cousin and her family moved so they're no longer in the neighborhood I miss so much.  She no longer sees the people from around there.  Why do people have to grow up?  I don't EVER wanna grow up. NEVER!  
Anyway, I think I've written enough about Mexico, and I know I failed to paint the full picture, but there's no way to put into words everything that went on, everything that I felt overthere.  I hope one day my kids get to experience something like this :)"

I've gotten over most of the hurt, it WAS a big deal yesterday, but today it seems more of a blow to the ego.  I BIG blow!  While at work I still got the sudden urge to cry a few times when I would stop to think about what happened.  So I would just occupy myself by makin' bracelets.  (my new hobby)  Durin' my first break I was up at the Q desk talkin' to Brisa, and she was gonna send me to go get her some coffee.  Well Hal (the only Team manager on duty) came up to us and said ""What are you doing wearing flip flops?""  So I pretended I was clueless, ""who are you talkin' to?""  ""You!""  I look down at me feet ""Holy crap! How'd those get there?!""  He laughed but then asked if I had any other shoes to change in.  Which I did because I always bring extra shoes when I try to get away with wearin' flip flops. Brisa tried to stick up for me..""I thought we were able to wear flip flops!""  He said No, they hadn't changed the books.  So I of course had to open my big mouth, if I can't wear flip flops, no one can.  I told him I saw someone else with the exact same shoes I had on...I wouldn't tell him who tho, so he spent the whole night lookin' for her.  Like at 4 he finally found her.  He comes up to me and says ""I'd like you to know that I have addressed that issue.""  I just laughed.  He's great sometimes, he's like everyone's daddy in the call center.

Onto a more serious note that I just remembered as I was typin' all that out.  I had a dream that my friend Carla had commited suicide.  And in the dream I was thinkin' about her, wantin' to call her to see how she was doing.  So it was all during the week that I was thinkin' this, and I kept tellin' myself ""maybe on my days off""  Well come Friday I don't know who it was that told me, but supposedly she had killed herself that Monday.  It was horrible...just thinkin' that we used to be so close, and when she stopped workin' with me, we stopped talkin', and now I would never talk to her again.  Because she was dead.  Anyway, I AM gonna call her soon.  Hopefully all is well.

I'm really hungry, my stomach is makin' funny noises.  I wish my pizza would hurry up and be ready.  Hmm...what is that I hear?  Is that silence in the living room??  OMGosh I might actually be able to go watch TV if Ernie's not watchin' it.  Gotta take the opportunity when it arises.  Gotta jet...ta ta"

Instead I was greeted with something 50 times more horrible than my night at work.  It's too much to even talk about (and y'all know I post just about anything on here...)I don't want everyone knowing certain details.  All I can say is...I deserved everything I had coming to me, I'm a big disappointment right now to my mom, but worst of all...and I didn't think this could be possible.  But I'm so incredibally disappointed in myself.  And I wish I had someone who I know I could talk to...someone who I know wouldn't judge me...the only person that I've found consolation in today happens to be 5000 miles away.  Thanks Jason.  I hope you read this.  I hope to God I can get over this before work cuz otherwise I'll be cryin' on the phones with the customers. The only time I've been able to NOT cry is while I was sleeping.  And I'm plannin' on sleeping some more.  I don't wanna think about anything.  And I thought havin' boy problems sucked.  This is by far the worst than any heartbreak.  There are times when I feel bad because of something and I start to feel sorry for myself.  Not this time...I don't feel sorry for myself at all.  I knew what I was doing and I continued anyway.

So anyway...I did get to go see Pesado!  I loved it!  They were awesome and the lead singer Beto looked so sexy.  I'm not sayin' cute, don't get me wrong cuz he's really not that cute.  But he's so sexy to me, partly because he reminds me of Jose (first love Jose).  Every so often he would wink at someone in the crowd and send his sexiness into unhumanly stature!!!  DAMN!  There were so many people squeezed into this tiny night club. The only thing that sucked about the night is that they cut up their performance into 2 shorter performances.  So they went on for an hour, then another group, and then I THINK they performed for 2 hours.  But since I had to work I had to leave after an hour of the second performance.  Which totally sucked!!!  I really wish I coulda stayed throughout the whole thing.  Next time hopefully :)

The weekend was cool.  On Sunday I went to watch Dodgeball with Amber, her mom and Logan.  OMG...it was hilarious!  I didn't expect much outta the movie, but it was really good.  If you go see it you MUST stay until all the credits are over.  The funniest thing happens at the very end.  All I have to say is ""My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...""  Hahaha.  So after that I went to her house and we found our new husband.  I'd seen him in one of my soap operas, and then again in Chasing Papi.  He was OK in my soap, but he was GORGEOUS in Chasing Papi.  So anyway yeah, we were bored and decided we'd look up pics of him.  We found so many gorgeous pictures of him, he is B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!  Here are just a FEW of his pics...
http://images.google.com/images?q=eduardo+verastegui&ie=UTF-8&hl=en
My favorite would be the second one...that man can wear blue like...um...like...like something really good. lol.

After hours (literally) of lookin' at pics of him, her mom told us to stop looking at naked men (I WISH HE WAS NAKED...lol) So we went to pick up her bro from work.  Then we went back to her house and drank a lil.  She tried Goldschlagger and I nearly threw up for her when she took the shot.  I think most of y'all know my incident with that stuff right?  If not, ask me and I'll tell ya.  So yeah, I only had one Jack Daniels Downhome Punch.  What a weakling I've become.  It's not that I couldn't handle anymore, I just didnt' feel like drinkin' really.

Saturday night, (or rather Sunday mornin') I get out at 2am, then I don't have to go to work til Thursday night, possibly Friday night!  Woohoo... Candace...Ladies night???  Haven't been in a while.  AND FOR SOME REASON I FEEL LIKE PARTYING DAMMIT!  lol..there's nothing wrong with partyin' every now and then right?  Right!  We might go see my father, I dunno.  It would be perfect if I could go to Mexico for the week.  I MISS MY COUSIN and all my friends.  I have a lot of catching up to do with Ivan...and Jose...and Tony...and Monica...and Tere...um...the rest of em...lol

"event","Hello to the people that actually read me :)  I haven't updated in a while which is rather unusual, considering I'd gotten so used to writing almost everyday.  I'm currently gettin' ready for ""work.""  I'm off tonight and I think I'm going somewhere with Candace, just don't know where yet.  Everyone else thinks I'm going to work.  My aunt came up from the Valley and she wanted me to babysit tonight, so therefore, I gotta work.  Sorry :( (evil laugh)  It's not that I don't like my cousin, I do, despite her ""I'm better than everyone else attitude"".  I have no problem with her, I find it a kick to be around her. She's into modeling, gymnastics, dance, and ballet.  She's gotten crownd Queen so many times.  Her most recent achievement was Miss 4th of July Queen.  She was in a parade and looked so cute.  She's 6 and incredibally spoiled.  If I have the means when I'm older my kids will prolly be spoiled too.  My aunt got here in tow with her Dooney and Bourke luggage and her Louis Vuitton purse...HELLO...can we please stick to one? LOL jk.  Since her Louis is her new 'pet' she gave my mom her old (I should say a few months old) Dooney purse.  IM STILL WAITING FOR MY LOUIS DAMMIT!!!  My uncles new toy is his Rolex.  Must be nice bein' them.  They can adopt me!
They went to DisneyLand not too long ago and brought me back the CUTEST Tinkerbell shirt.  It says ""Spoiled to perfection!""  She still spoils me sometimes...like when she can FINALLY get me my Louis Vuitton purse.  She also told me that when I go back to school and if I get really good grades she'll send me on a tour of Europe...cuz she can basically. LOL
Enough about them...I've been good lately.  No complaints I don't think.  I got to mentor at work.  That consists of listening to other ppls calls and tell them what they're doing wrong.  It felt powerful, and I loved it.:)
OHHHH...FINALLY TOMORROW I GET TO SEE PESADO.  They are this Mexican group that I absolutely LOVE. They're my spanish NSYNC...I LOVE THEM!  Something always comes up when they come to San Antonio, and I've been a fan for about 5+ years.  Everytime it's something different.  ONE time though was really bad.  OK, so they were here at Randy's on a Saturday night, but I was in Monterrey.  We came back early Sunday morning and they were in Monterrey Sunday night!  AND on top of that, we saw their bus headed TO Monterrey while we were headed AWAY from there.  I was ANGRY!!!
Well finally my wait is complete.  Supposedly I'm supposed to go in to work at 3:30 Saturday mornin' but I'm gonna see if I can get more coverage.  Point is...IM GONNA SEE PESADO!!! OK, I'm like so runnin' late for ""work"" and I don't want them to suspect!  Gotta go!"

"event","I think I'm bipolar people.  No, really I think I am.  After I finished writing my last post it took me about 5 minutes to stop crying.  Then about 2 minutes after that to call Amber, wake her ass up and I instantly got hyper.  We went to North Star Mall and I went to...(drum roll please) SEPHORA! YAY!!  I bought a lip gloss that surpasses all the rest in price range.  $23!  Second place trophy goes to my Lorac Lip Polish for $17.50.  And 3rd place would be my Lip Venom for $15.  I have quite a collection.  I don't think anyone could possibly use up all the lip gloss I've accumulated over the years.  It would really take a LOOOOONG time for me to finish every single one of them.
So after Sephora we went to our new favorite restaurant.  California Pizza Kitchen.  And we met our NEW favorite waitor.  OMG...hottie!  People, if you go to CPK look for Kevin.  BOY IS HOT!  Ohhh...I gotta tell y'all about a stupid girl there.  I called after we left CPK because I wanted to know how old Kevin was.  So this is my convo with a worker...

Me: (in bad Australian accent)Hello may I please speak to Kevin?
Worker:  Sure may I ask who's calling?
Me:  Yes, this is Veronica.
Worker: (pauses as if confused)I'm sorry we don't have any Veronica's working here.
Me: (tries really hard not to laugh)Right, I'm needing to speak to KEVIN.  THIS is Veronica.
Worker: OH...you need to speak TO Kevin on BEHALF of Veronica?
Me: Right dear!
***Here's your sign dumbass!***
BTW...I had to hang up cuz Amber wouldn't SHUT UP!  I called later, he's 24 ;)

I've not slept one bit, so I do believe I'm going to be tired tonight.  I should get going because I have to get up for work in about 4 hours.

"event","It started out as a good day.  Last night was good, my best friend took me Starbucks at work, I didn't have any calls that I didn't think I could handle.  I walked around as a supervisor for a while, took transfers, helped people find listings that they couldn't find.  Got off early at around 5:30, went to get Mike and Jesse Starbucks...everything was good.  Why...tell me, did things start going downhill?  I don't even know what happened, I was talkin' to Pio on the phone, we were jokin' around as usual and all of a sudden I got depressed.  Out of the blue.  Don't know what caused it...just got depressed.  I feel alone in this house.  My mom is in her room with...him.  Her ""friend.""  Yeah, her married friend that just so happened to start hangin' around when my dad went to jail.  Anyway, even my mom has someone...not that it's something unthinkable for my mom to have someone.  But, when am I gonna get my shot?  My mom has had her share of relaltionships.  I used to joke around with her that she'd gotten married enough times for the both of us.  Maybe it wasn't a joke afterall.

I don't want to be in this house anymore.  I can't just move out cuz I have like no money.  But it just truly depresses me to be here.  And as much as I hate to admit it, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Ernie has been spending the night at my uncles house since like Tuesday night.  No one is here to bother me, it's not normal.  I don't know why I get such evil vibes from my mom.  I know she's not a bad person, she's just...I dunno.  She's not the friendliest, once you get to know her she's funny as hell, but it kinda bothers me that she's not personable right off the bat.  AND WHY THE HELL am I pointing fingers?  I'm turning this into a bitch session about my mom when I need to look within.  I think I'm so screwed up.  It's not smart for ANYONE to talk to me, it's not smart for me to try to be a role model for my cousins.  All I do is try to spoil them, that's not going to get them to respect me.

Why can't I just have my grandpa here with me to hold me?  I need him...

Soo...anyway...

I'm engaged!  That WOULD be nice wouldn't it?  R...called me drunk last night and he asked me to marry him.  Fuck the job, fuck the family basically and just pack my shit and ""hurry up and get your ass up here!"" (his exact words)  I told him that if he remembered what we talked about in the morning then I'd marry him.  I called him this morning, first thing he says is ""I love you baby, will you still marry me?""  Shocked??? Hell yeah I was shocked!  I know he's so full of shit though.  I'm proud of the progress I've made because a few months ago if he had asked me I woulda held him to it.  Then I woulda been pissed when I found out he was BSing.  Now it's like...wow...it would be cool to get married, I think I'm ready...but I wouldn't marry him.  Not him.  If I tell myself that I wouldn't marry him you think I'd beleive it?  I'd like to think so.  So many things would have to change for me to accept.  I know he's a compulsive liar and Homie don't play that! I think I just find comfort in his voice.  Sounds weird right?  But it's true, its like I only believe the OLD R...the way he was when we first met.  So I choose to ignore all the times he's a jack ass and I just capitalize on the times that he's nice.  Like last night.

I had Starbucks last night! Yay!!!!  MMMMMMM...my one sinful pleasure is mocha frappuccinos.  (LOL wow, I just called Starbucks to double check my spelling of FRAPPUCCINO...anal much? haha...)

I'm getting kinda bored.  NO one is online!  Dammit!  I wanna talk to somebody.  I want someone to keep me entertained.  Oh well...guess I have to go watch a movie or something since no one cares about me!  Bye buttheads!"

It's been like 2 days since I've updated.  What kind of shit is that?  I'm slackin' man.  So anyway, I hate rude people!  Rude people shall inherit the underground dammit.  Seriousely if you're calling 411 and you're rude, don't expect to get the right number sweetie.  We have that power y'know ;)

Oh, I felt so bad for my friend Diana at work today.  At around 1ish someone told her they were trying to break into her truck, so she went outside and was there for a while.  When I went on my break I asked Brisa what happened and she said that they took her truck.  I'm thinkin' HOLY SHIT THEY STOLE IT...nope, they repo'd it.  I felt so bad for her, she'd been having lots of problems lately and now this.  Some of the best people get some of the shittiest hands delt to them.  I have faith that 'this too shall pass' though.

I'm the youngest person that hangs out with the group of ladies that I talk to, they are all in their 30s and 40s.  It's cool though.  I'm the baby :)

Um...I don't remember If I'd mentioned this already and I'm too lazy to check, but Brisa is leaving to work for the morning shift!!!!! How am I gonna get away with as much stuff as I used to?  Life is SO unfair! *pouts*

I'm about an hour we have to go meet Dustin (personal trainer).  We were supposed to meet up with him yesterday at 4, but something came up so we rescheduled.  We worked out alone though, we worked our arms, the exact same workout we did last time with Dustin, and I'm not hurtin' at all.  Yay! Go me!  Oh...BTW...I'm not understanding why no one wants to touch my legs!  When I tell someone (i.e. my mom, ernie or candace) to feel how hard my legs are getting, they're like ""no thanks!""  BUTTHEADS! *sticks tongue out*

OHH...if y'all read my wall of shame post y'all might have some insight as to who Yamairah and Keith are.  The other day while I was in the shower they came looking for me.  WHY???  Seriousely, I don't want to talk to them, so what the hell did they want?  I hope they don't come back because I know I'll pretend nothing happened and be forced to be a hypocrate.

Bah...I do believe that's about all I have for today.

OH NO WAIT!  I saw this quote that I liked, so I'll share it with y'all.  It's not ""technically"" a quote, it's just about why James Avery picked the hallmark he did...it was in my catalog OK and I liked it!

""I am often asked why I chose a candelabrum as our hallmark, and for what does it stand, if anything?
Burning candles have always brought light to darkness.  After having lived years in the darkness of agnosticism, I was helped back to the light one finds trhough faith and trust in God-a God of hope, love and promise.
The three candles are a Trinity symbol, and are also a reminder of God's precious care, grace and mercy.  At the base I humbly placed my initials.  
What better hallmark to show our commitment to what is good and right than three burning candles, shining lights of Life anf Hope."" -James Avery (craftsman)"

"event","Wow...what a night I had. Ok..where to start?  Hmm...I've heard it works to start at the beginning!

So, yesterday we finished paintin' the kitchen and stuff.  I spent the day with my 3 or 4 year old cousin Olivia, we did make up and stuff it was cool.  I went to the gym at 6 eventhough my asthma was actin' up.  The work out kinda helped oddly enough.  After that I wanted to go swimming.  So at around 10pm we went swimming at my uncles apartment.  Me, my brother Ernie, and Candace.  My cousin Carlee joined us in the pool.  After swimming I went up to see my cousin Annabella (the love of my life)and I decided I wanted to bring her home with me.  She was bein' such a dork in the car she'd be really loud and when I would turn around to quiet her down she'd go ""Oh! I sowy!""  but she never stopped...it was cute.

At around 2 ish we tried to get her to sleep in my room.  My brother slept on my bed and I slept on the futon on the floor with Bella.  We were listening to the songs on my radio and I guess Bella doesn't like country cuz when Rascal Flatts came on she goes ""OH!""  and gets up like nothing...throws all the clothes I'd put on my desk chair on the floor, and climbs up to my chair and tries to pretend she knows what she's doing on my computer.  It was the cutest thing, I got pics.  Then I finally decide enough cuteness, time for bed.  She starts crying because she wants to go with my mom.  But my mom has to work early.  She cries for 15 minutes or more until she starts gagging.  Yeah...I KNEW what was coming.  So I picked her up quickly and took her outta my room.  She threw up in 4 different places in my kitchen and dining room.  My mom wakes up and tries to calm her down.  So I have to clean this mess up.  I gag...easily!  The whole time I'm gagging but I manage to clean up.  My brother takes her a bath while I continue to clean, I went outside to get a bucket of water and entertained myself with a beetle that was like 2 sizes bigger than my big toe.  I thought it was cool, I decide to keep it as a pet.  DON'T ASK!  I'm not the kinda person to do something like this.  So after all that is said and done we bring Bella back to my room.  I ask her what the bugs name is and she says ""Bug!""  So...that's his name.

Back to the task at hand, get her to sleep.  She's playin' with my princess cards then finally I'm like OK lights out, it's 4 or 4:30 and when I turned the lights out she started crying...AGAIN.  This time after 5 minutes I realized she wanted the lights on...so THEN she goes to sleep.  She wakes up every so often to look at me, and pat me to try to wake me up...""Thither"" (in an attempt to say ""sister"" all my cousins call me sissy but I guess she wants to be different??) Then she goes back to sleep. 

So, yeah, I'm tired right now...but it was worth it.  It gave me such an important feeling of motherhood.  And it was great, eventhough it was gross. Since I prolly won't get married I'll prolly never have kids so I'm glad God let me have this one moment with my Bella whom I love so much."

~""If people knew what kind of mother I was, they'd say, 'What kind of mother are you?'"" -Ambers mommy (my mommy too)

~After spending like every day with Amber during the summer.  ""Was it me or you who dreamt that all the crosses on your wall were upside down?"" -Me

~After telling Candace that I thought Gretchen Wilson sounded like Natalie Maines.  ""I think she kinda sounds like the Dixie Chicks..."" -Candace (btw for those of you who don't like country...Natalie is the lead singer for Dixie Chicks)

~Amber gets up in Shelbie's (one of her dogs) face and starts barking at her just to make her bark even more.  She turns around with her nose up in the air.  ""I wonder what I just said?"" -Amber

~""Does that say Chicken Babies??"" -Me.  Reading something that REALLY said 'Children/Babies'

~""I can hear your sparkle!"" -Yamairah (when we were still friends obviousely[before I knew she was a baby killer!])

~""Quit yo'self!"" -Me

~""Who's autobiography are you writing?"" -Yamairah

~""People in America speak American!"" -Amber

~""The shirts at Old Navy were on sale 2 for $18.  So I bought 6!"" -Me

~Amber and I were arguing about which one of us her mommy loved more.  So the convo went something like this...
A:My mommy told me she likes me better!
C:She called me while you were in the bathroom and said she like me better!
A:She faxed me while you were getting the cheese from the fridge and said she like me better!
C:She emailed me while you were toasting your bread and said she liked me better!
A:She text messaged me when you were putting your sandwich together and said she liked me better!
C:Well she sent me a telegram...right now! And said she like me better!
....some time passed, we went upstairs to watch TV and some talk show was on.  Amber looks at me and says ""Crystal, when I become the greatest extra to never make it famous I'm gonna go on that talk show and say 'Crystal...my mommy loves YOU more than she loves ME!'""  (Obviousely she meant it the other way around so we laughed our asses off!)

"event","Hey y'all Happy 4th of July!  Yay...GO AMERICA!! LOL.  Wow I'm tired.  I just wanted to update real quick and let y'all know that I'm good now.  No more depression...(for now anyway ;))

Work went GAHREAT!  Since they anticipated a lot of calls from stupid asses we had a BUNCH of ppl doing overtime so it was prolly like the slowest day all week.  They were giving away prizes all night and they had hot dogs and chips.  It was cool.

I was wearing this Superman (instead of the regular colors the S had the american flag pattern on it) shirt that I cut around the collar and it fit to where it was like kinda off my shoulders, and underneath I wore a red tank top, it looked REALLY cute.  So I'm transferring a call to dumbass Gilbert and first thing he says on the phone ""Girl, take that shirt OFF!""  My mouth drops and I turn to look at him across the call center, and he starts crackin' up.  I completely lost my train of thought, so I was like ""just take the call dammit""  He walked by later and was like ""I'm sorry I didn't realize how bad that sounded til I saw your face.  I said it because Shaq likes Superman!""  For the first time he actually didn't mean something sexual and I took it that way. lol

There was this guy that I went to H.S. with that was workin' overtime and we was sittin' like 2 seats away from me.  The whole time he was tellin customers stuff like ""I'm not the dumbass here...yeah, SHUT UP!""  ""You're drunk aren't you, that's why you don't know what the hell you're looking for!""  ""Hey punk, I know who you are, I have you're number, you're 6'6"" and weigh 230 lbs, so DON'T tell me I don't know how to do my job.""  All they did was email his manager like at the END of his 4 hours of working...dude, I woulda fired him on the fuckin' spot.  Why does he get to talk to the customers like that and NOT us???  That's not cool!

Anyway..like I said I'm tired, so I'm gonna go night night now.  Otay?  Ta ta!  Leave me a message if you read this and tell me what you did for the 4th ok?  Good deal!"

"event","I'm extremely...BLAH..I don't even know how to explain it!!!  The night didn't start well to begin with.  Just the fact that some people that call are complete and total morons.  I can't single any out I don't think, just everyone was pissing me off.  Then all of a sudden during my lunch break I started gettin' extremely depressed. So what does Crystal do when she's depressed?  She calls R...yeah...WHY???  Why did I bother calling him?  I KNEW he wasn't going to be up, or if he was up, he was going to be out.  So I couldn't even leave a fuckin' message cuz his mail box is full. He should delete the messages from all the other hoes that call him.  So once I realized I wasn't talkin' to R... I just got more depressed.  I ended up going into my truck and listening to my new Gretchen Wilson cd (which is GREAT for you who don't have it), and crying.

WHY DO I CRY???

And will my tears ever run out?  Because I fear that's the only way I'll stop crying.  I don't want to cry, esp. over someone who is SO not worth it.  But once again, when I get depressed I don't just think about R...I also think about Jose and how...how...I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF THE FUCKIN' WORD...but how stupid I was over him, and how much I loved him, and how much I would have sacrificed to be with him.  At 15 I was willing to leave with him and get married and give up on the DREAM that I've had of my Debut since I was like 5.  I was willing to leave my family, I just wanted to be with him.  I know it sounds MAD since I was only 15, I KNOW I woulda regretted it.  But I wanted that more than anything I've ever wanted in my life.  I wanted to be his.

I wish all this shit didn't go through my head.  I'm starting to fear there's something wrong with me.  I think next time Amber sees her psychiatrist I'm gonna tell her to mention me and how fucked up I am.  My family can't suspect anything is wrong with me.  Because I don't show this side in front of them.  I keep my depressions to myself as much as I can.  I have sooo much built up inside me that I think it would be TOO painful to let out all at once.  It would literally kill me.  So in turn I opt for the million and one mini depressions.  I just wanna curl up in my bed and...just be left alone by the world.  For a LONG LONG time.  I don't wanna talk to anyone, I don't want to put up more false acts.  I wanna let this all go away first...

I wrote this a while back and never finished it...but I think it suits my mood right about now...

""Why won't this pain go away?  Will it never go away?  Will the 8th wonder of the world come before my eyes hold no pain?  I want to scream at the top of my lungs, I want to drown my hurt in alcohol and sing depressing songs til I'm so choked up I can't talk.  I want to fall asleep with tears in my eyes and wake up with stains of my face.  When I realize that it's a new day and you're not by my side, I want to cry again.  After all my tears are gone I'll go about my day putting up a facade reapplying my fake smile during the course of my long day without you.  I'll see you everywhere as I try to lead what some call a life.  In people that look like you, people that look like your parents, your friends, trucks that look like yours, smells that remind me of you, (beer, cigarette smoke and eternity combined).  How is it that I carry you everywhere with me and I still miss you like crazy?!""

This was my life for 4 years.  This is what I did everyday, everynight, I listened to songs that reminded me of him...sang in my room through the tears.  Hug my pillow and fall asleep hoping he'd be here when I woke up.  Well obv. it never happened.  I got tired of it.  It took me long enough.  I can't say that I don't hurt over Jose anymore, because I think I always will.  There will always be a part of me that yearns to hurt for him.  I don't know who I am without this hurt.  I somehow find comfort in heartbreak.  But for a long time it was a pain that I'd feel only instantly and just like that it would go away.  Just peek out to let me know it was still here.  But I find myself thinking more of it when I feel other pain.  R...for example.  I think it's anger more than pain that I feel, but with that anger comes Jose's pain.  DO I MAKE ANY SENSE???  I think I stopped making sense a long time ago.  I think basically one person hurts me and it just brings to surface all the other ppl that hurt me, and since Jose hurt me more than anyone that hurt stands out immensely.

Time for bed for me, I've let out what I've had to for a day.  Now I retire to my music and my pillow.  They will never let me down....never."

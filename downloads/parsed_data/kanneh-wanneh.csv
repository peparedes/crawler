I talked to Leah on the phone today..Along with Kingsley(Or Shadow, for those of you who don't know his name.) Me and him were kinda making fun of Leah..And I feel bad for that now..I apologized to her and now it's all better <3.
Me and Bura's relationship is going well..We luff each other a lot. Annnnnd...She's so cute <333.

And..Finally..Leah was acting strange a while ago..She was all upset that she took too many Tylenols..So I hugged her and stayed with her for a while..I luff her too, As a good friend though. I think she's asleep by now..I'll be happy if she is..Cause she needs the sleep.Okee..I think that's about it....Wait..Andddddddd...Me and my family went out on our boat to watch the fireworks on the Cedar River >.O..It was..somewhat fun..I guess..And..That's about it?..I'm gonna go read my book till I fall asleep..

And..Another thing..I took this test....And here are my results..

"event","So the house hunt is still up in the air, which sucks because I've got to be out of my apartment by the 15th. But the good news is that Mollie and I adopted a new roommate (Brock) and so we can get a bigger place with a yard and everything and still pay the same each. I'm pretty excited. We're looking at a place on Flax (heading to ID 21) and might sign the papers tomorrow. I just hope everything works out for the best.

Also, not sure if I mentioned but the whole Kade situation crashed and burned. I feel like such an ass, but to cope with my feelings of rejection I'm going out on 2 dates tonight, then one tomorrow. I'm feeling like such the little pimp now, but I'm worried about 2 dates back-to-back. Hope I can handle those fellas :)

Finished 3 out of my 8 finals, and have a good feeling about the rest. I think this semester will end smoothly so let's just hope everything else does as well (ie job, moving, etc). I'll keep y'all posted.

Anwyays, the roommate's home so I better get going. Later."

"event","My, oh my...so much time has gone by. Where to start...

Ok, it has officially been 3 weeks since Adam and I broke up and we're doing really well as friends. We've only spoken about 4 times, but our conversations have been very cordial and civil towards one another and we can talk like old friends. I'm really impressed that there's no awkwardness, at least on my part, towards our relationship. I hope things continue like this.

And speaking of guys...I think I'm going to go on strike for a bit. There's a long story involved, one in which I get stirred up every time I retell it, and so let's just say that for the time being, I've given up. I hate how all the guys who like you, you're not interested in, and the guys you adore can't seem to find the balls to show their apparent interest and so you're forced to move on. I'm sick of making the first move, and so I choose not to this time. Yes, I'm taking a stand on this.

Oh, and hit up Bogus before it closed this weekend for my first run at snowboarding. Since the whole Powder Mountain with Adam didn't work out I went with Mollie and had such a blast. I figured that since it was my first time I'd be on my ass the majority of the time we were out on the hills  buit I actually did really well and came out bruise/injury free. It's so helpful having a 5 year boarder helping you learn.

BSU is alright at the moment as well. Classes are rocking me hard, but it's nothing I can't handle. I think I'll be able to pull the grades I want and even found a loophole in the residency requirements that'll save me $7,000. I love cheating the system.

Anyways, everything I'd planned on talking about has completely escaped me, so I'll leave it at this for now. Much love to all."

"event","You know, it finally hit me last night. It was one of those knock-you-off-your-ass type moments. I was at Mollie's, not feeling very well, and all of a sudden it hit me--Adam and I are no longer together. I don't know why it wasn't registering until then, but it finally clicked. 

I can honestly say that he was the first person to ever get to me, or even come close to my heart. And it kills me that we're not together; it physically hurts in the most terrible way. Just seeing his picture brings tears to my eyes and it is the worst feeling in the world, knowing that the best thing that's happened to you in a long time, perhaps ever, is now gone. And usually I'm so strong about these types of things, I can shrug it off and pretend like it never happened. But I can't ignore this, as much as I try, I just can't.

Maybe it's the complete humilitation of being rejected, or perhaps my pride that stands in the way, but either way it's impossible for this to be reconcilled. I always avoided relationships for this exact reason, and for one time in my life, a guy got the better part of my heart and broke it. It's as if I was thrown aside like I was garbage, not worth a dime. And this is completely my emotions talking, I'm sure he'd say different, but you can't help what you feel (I always told my dad that when he asked me why Adam and I were together).

And this is probably the most terrible thing you've all heard cross my lips, but I feel so abandoned now. Maybe it was the fact that I felt so safe with Adam, as if he were going to protect me from all the Aaron's of the world, but I can't shake this feeling of loneliness. I have everything a girl could want here, great friends that truly love me and would do anything for me; a wonderful family that I couldn't live without--even though they drive me crazy half the time--but I have no one to give my love and heart to and it breaks my heart just a tiny bit more each time I think about it.

But seriously, the situation is simple--Adam chose not to be with me; No hesitation, no fight, no question. I guess I just need to realize that and move on. It's time to suck up all the tears and get over it. I guess I'll just put up all my walls again, just like before. Question every person that comes into my life, guarding any emotion I have as if it were the air I breathe. Time to get back to what I do best..."

"event","So my Spring Break was a tragic mess.

First, Adam and I were fighting before he even got here. He was calling me ""kid"", ""Spoiled brat"", and ""Snapper"" (you'd have to know the story behind the last one) and insulting my family which never puts me in a good mood. Then as soon as he gets off the plane, he points to his luggage and expects me to haul all his shit around. No sir, you're the one with the big muscles, take care of your own shit. Then, we get home and he starts in on Melissa and DeWayne, insulting them to such a severe degree that we start yelling at each other (that's a first for us). Then, that night he meets my friend Mollie and her boyfriend Broc, whom both I love dearly, and afterwards, he starts in on them telling me that Broc is absolutely THE MOST boring person he's ever met and that Mollie is juvenile and clinically insane. Then we get home, Mollie calls to tell me that she's lost her keys and wonders if she's left them at my apartment. I'm searching and all the while Adam is telling me that if I'm going to be THAT loud that I need to take my conversation outside because he can't hear the TV. Yeah...

So, I tell him what a jackass he's being and that saying shit about my friends and family is probably one of the most hurtful things he could do and he shrugs it off. Then I tell him that if he so dearly loves watching the TV he can go to the Community Building and watch it there because he sure as hell won't be telling me what I can do in my own damn house. He then turns up the volume.

Needless to say, since he's ignored everything I've said, I didn't feel the need to stay around much. So I went to work, studied, did grocery shopping, paid bills, and the entire time he chooses to stay at home. So then we head to McCall, and get into another fight (he blames me for the state parks being under 6 feet of snow and the town shut down for the beginning of the week) and then we come home and he starts to pack. So I let him pack, hell, why should I stop him? If he wants to go then I'm all for it.

So because I didn't ask him why he was packing, he got upset and asked if we could talk. First time hes' approached me on the subject. Then we start fighting, well, he's yelling I'm just sitting there with a blank stare on my face while he throws a fit, and he breaks up with me. Finally, it's over.

And you know, I'm really glad that there were snow storms in New Mexico and that we didn't make it to his parents because how embarassing would that be if we broke up while we were down there. Ugh, hate the thought. But yes, we're broken up and it only took 4 days of him being down here. And you know what? The most interesting thing about this is that it's our first real fight and he calls off the entire relationship. You'd think that for a relationship to last, you need to fight and make up to test the strength of your bond. But no, one fight for him is enough. It's terribly ironic, but we broke up on our 8 month anniversary. I love it.

Anyways, mOllie told her friend at work, the Medical Supervisor of the donation center, and apparently he's got the biggest crush on me and wants to ask me out. I'm not real keen on the idea as of yet, seeing as how I just broke up with my boyfriend yesterday, but the thought is tempting to just get out of the house and have a good time with someone new. I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see what happens there. Just thought I'd fill you all in on the dramatics of my spring break so far. Still have 5 days to go, let's see what other drama will erupt.

Later.

PS- Mel and I are good again. Things always work out between us. I swear, we'll be best friends up until we croak. Sweet and yet scary thought."

The age difference may create some difficulties in terms of compatibility. However, similar personality descriptions are a plus. Their shared faith will help form a bond between them. They both abstain from drinking, so that helps compatibility. Both are also sports fans, and that can bring people together. A mismatch in athleticism could decrease compatibility. Their astrological signs are in harmony, though, which is a plus. Their common love of animals is another good thing. And their views on children are similar. Overall, Ami and Adam are quite compatible. There are a few rough spots, but nothing that cannot be overcome. &#9829;<br><br><a href=""http://www.datingdiversions.com/dating_compatibility.html"">Dating Compatibility Test</a> on <a href=""http://www.datingdiversions.com/"">Dating Diversions</a></div></div>"

"event","So, it's been over a week since we've talked and things are good. I'm enjoying my solitude and not being at the apartment much. It's the first night in 4 that I've slept in my own bed. Mollie and I are talking about getting an apartment together next year...but we're both really hesitant because we've both had terrible experiences with roommates and so the thought is a bit scary. I don't think I can handle another psycho on my hands. But I think it'll be ok. I figure if I can handle living with Mel for a year Mollie will be a piece of cake. I wish I could just get an apartment by myself, but a studio's a bit too pricey for me on a college budget and so I'll settle for a roommate.

But I've secured my family's condo on Powder Mountain (Utah) for Adam's visit. Only $75 for 3 days. The place is gorgeous. 3 bedrooms, fireplace, hot tub, family room, living room, kitchen, master suite...it's going to be great! We'll stay there a few nights and hit the slopes before we're on our way to his parents' house. I've never been snowboarding before and Adam's really good and so he's excited to teach me. I'm hoping that in NM I'll work on my tan, and on the slopes I'll fall so many times that my ass will be nice, round and swollen by the time I get back home. Damn, I'll be a sight to see. I'll be sure to take pics for you all :)

"event","Long story short--Melissa and I got in the biggest fight we've ever had. I actually screamed in her face to fuck off, and never have I done that in anything but a joking manner. But I was pissed. My redhair came on full force and I let her have it.

You're probably wondering why I got so upset. It's summed up by her being jealous at me having other friends. I don't like drinking with her because I always have to take care of her puking ass and my night is inevitably ruined on her account. So I go to a house party with my friend Mollie and Mel gets pissed. Heaven forbid I have other friends. It's absolutely ridiculous but apparently I'm the one at fault because supposedly I'm throwing away our 10 year friendship over a fucking house party in which I didn't even drink. Ok Melissa, you make so much fucking sense. But hey, it took 10 years of her pissing me off to finally get me to snap and put her in her place. And now she's ending our friendship because of it. But to brighten things up, my lease is up on the 15th of May and so in 2 months I'll never have to see her again. Woohoo!!

Oh, school is going good too. I found out that I got a C on my accounting test, but it's only the first test and I can and most certainly will get that damn grade up. It's my lowest and won't be a pitiful C once I get my hands on it. But yeah, I love my classes, this school, Boise in general...but I just don't like my living situation. But I figure that 3 out of 4 isn't too shabby and so I can't complain. But please excuse my vent, it was sorely needed.

Anyways, I've got quite a few phone calls to return so I best be off. Much love to all."

"event","Is it just me, or is everyone else from the asscrack of USA (otherwise known as Kalama) feeling the pressures to fit into their tiny fucking mold?! Good Lord I'm so sick of that fucking town. Not only is it bad enough that my family, in my opinion, hates my boyfriend because of the age difference, but whenever we're out and about in public (on a rare occasion we're actually in Kalama) everyone stops us and asks when we're getting married. I'm sick of it. Melissa and I sat down the other night and thought of how many people we knew from our high school that were married and/or having kids. IT WAS OVER 50 PEOPLE!!! My high school only enrolls about 300 people so don't mind me when I say that that it a fucking staggering statistic. But no, everytime I'm back in Po-dunk, I get faced with the almighty question. Fuck, even being out here in Idaho people will write to me on Myspace and ask me, or call me up and want to know the relationship ""scoop"" and future plans. Then when I say that we're not even thinking about marriage, I get told that I'd better hurry up because I'm ""behind"" my classmates and that my ""clock"" is ticking. Forgive me when I say this, but my uterus is plenty healthy and has baby-producing power for quite some fucking time to come. There's no rush for curly little redheads running around making a mess of all my things and emptying my bank account just yet. And besides, it's been 7 months. Not 7 years for Heaven's sake.

Oh, and as usual...things at home (Boise) are in the shitter. Can I ask you all a quick question? Here goes: Do I have a trying personality? Apparently my roommate thinks so because she's been unable to stop bitching me out for the past 3 days. Oh, prime example: we needed some shampoo and dental floss last night and so I run to the store to pick some up while she's on the phone with her boyfriend. Harmless errand, right? Oh no, not according to missy here, who immediately calls me up, insists where I'm am, what the fuck I'm doing, when I'm going to be home, and why I didn't leave a note. Fuck...me...sideways...then shoot me in the fucking face!!! I feel like I'm 3 years old again and living with my mother. Ugh, having to report to someone 24/7 is not something that I can deal with. Especially when it's an overbearing, selfish bitch!

Ok, enough with my rant. Some good news: the plans are all made for New Mexico and I couldn't be happier. I'm just excited to get away from this warden for a few days and have some peace. Oh, and I'm bringing Sydney to Des Moines to Adam's house. He's so pumped and I'm estactic because that another reason I'm being yelled at (surpirse, surprise). But I'll be home for 2 days and hopefully she'll be in Pullman getting laid. Maybe then she'll be civil.

Ha ha, so enough with my ranting for tonight. I've got 2 midterms on Friday and so I should probably study for them. Love you all and I'll try to be more positive on my next update. Later!"

It was great, but busy as hell from the minute I landed to return takeoff. We celebrated with Shae and Jo, then his friend Ben, then us, and had a ball around the city for 2 days (Lord, I miss Seattle!). It was such a relaxing trip home.

So, last night was interesting. It's my 21st birthday, right? I ended up being the designated driver for my lush-assed friends (6 fellas--I still love you guys!) and took care of them until 3:30am afterwards...they can't hold their alcohol.

Then, my most wonderful best friend and I get all gorgeous and go out for dinner. We hit up the Cottonwood Grill here downtown BoDo and it was super-fab! Not only were the staff drop-dead-gorgeous, much like ourselves (they made great eye candy since our Loves were at home in Washington), but the entire place was at our disposal. Everyone from the hostess, to the bartender, to our waiter, to other patrons knew it was my birthday and they showed it. We were treated so well, and not only got a discount on our meal, but was told ""Happy Birthday"" by almost every staff member. It was such a great night. PLUS: I got to spend it with Melissa which made it even better. My last birthday felt kinda alone in Hawaii without my family and best friends (though I had new friends Susan and Mavi which made me super happy) and so being able to spend it with ""my girl"" made it twice as special.

But now I'm winding down from a great birthday celebration. Got to talk to my Love (Adam, I love you!) but pretty much everybody in my family and most of my friends. My entire month has been made in this one night."

See, the last time I hung out with them, they were feeling each other up, making out, spending most of their time in their bedroom fucking while I was out by myself, and so this time I respectfully decline the invitation to hang with them and I'm labeled a bad friend. Does this make much sense? It doesn't to me either, and so I'm forced to laugh and her stupidity. When my boyfriend came out to see me, we were completely respectful towards her and showed no PDA and didn't have sex during his visit and yet she still felt uncomfortable. But when her boyfriend comes out and they DO perform all those things and I choose to leave, apparently it's a different situation. I hate double standards and the people who think they are too good to have things equal, but this is what I have to live with. I've tried having a rational discussion with her, but nothing works. I think that the only thing would be the same situation flipped in reverse. Have her be in my situation being disrespected and see how she feels. But it's such kindergarten games and I shouldn't have to resort to acting like I'm 5 to make a point. But when you're dealing with someone who's maturity level is lower than yours, what would work for you may not work for them so here I sit, trying to figure out my situation. Decisions, decisions..."

We wasked Brian and he had no clue, but Nick has hinted towards the fact that he doesn't like Melissa and I having boyfriends. He was pissed that we got back to Boise for one whole night and then left for Pullman for the weekend so Mel could see DeWayne. He ranted that he'd not seen us for a month and then the minute we get back we leave again over ""some guy"". Then once we get back from Pullman he begins to diss Adam and I just barging into my room, taking my phone and hanging up on Adam, throwing things at me (scratching my face in the process -- belt hooked my eye and nose), messing up my room trying to get me to come out into the living room and talk to him and I finally had to grab my bat and threaten to beat his ass if he didn't fuck off. It's sad that things have to come to this to get some privacy but he's so disrespectful. I told Melissa that I didn't want to live by them next year and that we're better off just getting a house of our own to create some distance between the four of us. Besides, Melissa and I will be working so much that we'll hardly see each other let alone the guys and if it's bad now with Nick feeling neglected by one vacation, it's going to be hell with him being ignored for an entire year. So she's going to have a talk with him tonight once she gets home from work (I tried to talk her out of it but she insisted) and let him know that she's not appreciative of it any more than I am and that things are going to have to change or our friendship with him will. Kind of an ultimatum I guess, but oh well. He's being a shit and neither of us can take drama with him just because he wants to spend his every waking minute with us. 

But Boise is beautiful. Got the chance to work out on a horse ranch in Kuna and am so excited to be getting back into the saddle again. I'll get to groom, train, work, and take care of about 10 horses this semester and am so excited at the chance. Plus, they're going to pay me for it which is a double bonus since I'd have done it for free. So that's always good. Am also up for a ""family assistant"" position by Mel's work. Cute little kids and 2 big dogs. My dream!!! But yeah, not sure how I stand as far as other contenders but it's looking good since I've got everything they're looking for and their kids like me. But I'll let you all know how it turns out.

Anyways, I've wasted the day away relaxing and have got a lot of things to get done before school starts up for me and Mel on Wednesday so I'll talk to you all later. All my love. Ami"

I spent 11 out of my 26 days at home with my dad and he still complains that it's not enough. I swear, if I was anywhere besides Adam's apartment he'd be fine, but no, daddy's little girl can't have a boyfriend. I'm just waiting until the day I come home for the summer and live with Adam instead of the folks. Should be great fun and much drama, I'm sure, but will be good nonetheless for my dad to finally begin to let go and realize that I'm not his little 4 year old baby girl anymore. But yeah, the day before and day of me leaving was so hard. I would randomly burst intot ears at the thought of leaving Adam...again...and it was so bad. He could tell something was wrong but I didn't want to tell him or to let him see me cry. I don't know, it's hard being so far away from the one person you love so much, but the good thing is that our birthday's are coming up (mine--Feb 5th...big 21, his--Feb 11th) and I'm definitely coming home to see him and for us to celebrate together.

As for Christmas and New Years, they were great. Saw many old friends, many new ones courtesy of Adam, and a lot of ex-coworkers. Plus, can't forget the family...all 26 members. Oh, and Rita's pregnant! I'm so excited! I can't wait to have another little rugrat running around. Plus, with Cayden still being so young, he'll have a best friend and family member to play with and will help keep the new grands busy with diapers and bottles.

But the situation with Nycole is ridiculous. If any of you don't know, Nycole and I had a major falling out...including many curse words that I dare not repeat and just plain harsh words. It's a pity that a 10 year friendship had to end this way, but it was time, hell, it was beyond time for it to end. But I'm good, it's been a major relief and such a weight off of my shoulders to not have her in my life (is that mean??) and in the spirit of celebrating bitches-be-gone Mel and I are heading to Pullman to see DeWayne, Mary and many friends from high school this weekend and all should be fun. I'm hoping that we can reminisce with some and forget about others, but it should be interesting nonetheless.

Anyways, it's already 6:30 here in Boise and I'm starving. Heading out for a poker game and some tavern food (gotta love the bar chips!). Much love to you all, with a tad bit more to others (you know who you are). Talk to you all soon.

Love Ami"

"event","I've never seen the Puget Sound look this gorgeous. We've been getting hit really hard by winter storm after storm, and everything is white and beautiful. I, myself, am trapped at my brother's house. I've been hanging out here, just spending some much needed time getting to re-know my brother and his wife, and we've been having a lot of fun. Actually, my brother (further referred to as Matt) has been helping me out a lot as far as school is concerned. See, my major here at BSU is a BBA in Marketing (Bachelors of Business Administration specializing in Marketing) but apparently that is too general of a subject and a degree that won't get me much and so we're going to look up the differences in Accounting and the degree I'm waist deep in already and see what other classes I""d need to take in order to make the switch. Oh, and found out that I didn't bomb my Calculus class like I thought, but really got a gorgeous C. Now I'm sitting pretty at one A and one C, and I've got 3 classes to go.

Oh, also, have not seen Adam since I've been up here. It's the 20th and I've only heard form him twice since I've been home (3 days now). Hmmm, weird. Though I know he's still working, has been sick, and knows that I was celebrating with my family down south, but still. I think it's weird. 

Plus, I got the opportunity to get the dog of my dreams--a Great Dane--for free but for the next 4 months have no place to stash him. See, my apartment is through the University so pets are strictly prohibited. Plus, he's so big that he'd have a rough time living in a little apartment. But we won't be getting our house until this summer when our lease runs out and so for 4 months I've got to figure out a way to take care of him. He's a rescue puppy and Matt and Rita are going to help me get him (the actual ""rescue"" part), but it's a question of whether or not I can find someone to pay to take care of him until I come home. This is my Christmas wish and by God, I'm gonna do it!!!

Anyways, the puppies are getting restless so we're gonna go outside and have fun in the snow. xoxo"

"event","Studying for 4 days straight now...I'm so mentally exhausted. But, alas, I only have one more final to go and it's in one of my favorite classes so it should be fairly easy. All I have to do is fill in some bubbles, give an impromptu speech (of her choosing, depending on where she sees my strengths) and then one of my 3 analysis essays. I think I'm going to with my advertising one, since it's my strength. THought my other 3 are pretty damn good too, this one will be short, sweet, and to the point. The sooner I can get out of this place the happier I'll be.

But sold back one of my books today and got $64.50 for it to which I was surprised. That $$ put the polishing touches on all my gifts. I'm so excited now, I'M DONE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING!!! Hale-fucking-lujah! I'm so pumped. I've started packing tonight (I know I should be studying right now, but my final isn't until 5:30 tomorrow night and so I think I'll be ok if I get up early tomorrow morning) and I have like 2 huge bags of 1) extremely witty and thoughtful christmas gifts and 2) extra shit I don't use over here and so I'm taking it home and emptying my crammed bedroom just a bit. It's nice to have more space and less shit to clutter it with. Just like spring cleaning.

But still haven't heard back from Nycole as of yet. I've made a mental time limit of when she needs to reply and it ended up being Saturday before my flight. I don't know, if she doesn't get back to me, then she doesn't. No loss here, it'll be the closer I need. And if she does, fuck it, it's still closure. Ha ha ha, evil Ami.

Ahhh, I'm in such a great mood right now. I wish you all could see me. My hair is slick straight under my cowgirl hat (my poor curls didn't fit) and I'm belting out Josh Gracin's ""Stay With Me"" with my apartment door open for all to hear. Ha ha ha, my neighbors must hate me, but it's all in good fun. Plus, they make me gag by their bad cooking that smells up the building and so I figure it's ok for me to saturate the entire first floor with country music. Ah yes, 'tis what I'll do. Hope they like Keith Urban, 'cause he's up next :)

Anyways, I should probably hit the books tonight sometime before I hit the sheets, just to get one up on my studies in the morning. One more song....

Talk to you all later!! xoxo"

Thanksgiving was great. It was nice because I got to spend a lot of time with Adam and family, but we saw SO MANY people it was ridiculous. Let's see, including my family, and Adam's family, we saw over 45 people. I'm exhausted. Since when did the holidays mean you have to have a family reunion? Don't get me wrong, I love my family, but not an overload like that. Plus I saw Mary and Nycole (ugh, nycole) and had a little madgab session there...not something I'm wanting to repeat anytime soon. But after Adam meeting my family and my meeting his, all in all it went well.

"event","Ahhh, comm 101, comm 101, comm 101. That class will be the end of me. I swear, I've aged more in that class than in my 20 years. So, tonight we were giving personal speeches. Everything was going well. I was going to share a very personal story of mine to my class. It's the only way I can really get it out properly. So things were going really well until my classmate Rhonda got up and talked about rape, domestic violence and how women should take self-defense courses. I fell to pieces. I burst out in tears and had to leave the classroom. Everything was going fine up until then. I never really had a problem with what happened. I could talk about it to Melissa, Randy, Adam and Andi. They were all very supportive and understanding. I thought I was ready to deliver my speech to the class but when I got up there I fell apart. I was crying like a baby! 

I took it really slow at first. Probably because I couldn't really catch my breath between the sobs. I told them just enough of what happened that they got a good idea, but not enough for it to be too graphic. Told them how it's affected me since...I mean it's only been 2 months but it's still made a huge impact. 

Almost everyone in my class was crying right along with me. Even the guys. Normally I'm very upbeat and happy so they really got to see a more personal side of me. Afterwards my teacher came up to me, gave me this huge hug, told me how proud she was of me and how amazing my speech was. She couldn't believe how brave I was to tell something so personal to all of my classmates. I'm going to go visit her more often because she's the head of the women's department and can offer me more help than I'd attempt getting on my own. She's so great. Plus all of my classmates were so great afterwards. Many of them I'd never really talked to, but even though it was horrible what happened, telling them brought us closer not only as classmates (we're all VERY comfortable around each other now) but as possible friends as well. I don't know, I'm actually looking forward to going to that class now and almost regret that it's close to being over. It's helped me not only get over my fear of speaking in front of people, but also of being hesitant of letting people in. I don't know these people and yet I've showed them a side of me they'd never have seen without knowing me for awhile. It's nice to finally let people in."

"event","Ok, so I had a big fight with both Adam and Melissa. There's a first for both. First for my relationship and first for my roommate over here. Well, Adam's was because he was being very judgemental towards Melissa and critisizing me and my friendship with her. Of course saying things about my best friend will fire me up, especially when they're not nice. But the good things is that I ripped into him, shared my opinions and feelings, and then by the end of the conversation everything was fine. Because we talk about it. That's the key. He's rational and reasonable.

Now, my fight with Mel was absolutely retarded. It's over her wanting to fly to Florida to stay the weekend with some guy she's never met just so that she can go to a Duke v. Florida basketball game. I mean, they've talked on the phone one time, and for a duration of about 15 mins and now suddenly she's wanting to go see him. I told her that I thought it was creepy for him to do that since they've never met and that although it's a nice gesture for the tickets, buying a plane ticket to Florida to stay with some random guy she met over the internet for a few days was really creepy and I didn't like the idea of her doing that. So we get home, she yells at me telling me I don't understand and storms off to her room and slams the door. Typical for Melissa. So I figure I can't stand being cooped up in our apartment and go for a walk. I'm talking on the phone having a serious conversation with Adam (his goddaughter has been missing for 3 days, etc) and Melissa tries calling in like 3 times. Obviously I'm not going to switch over when he's having a crisis and I figure that once I'm off the phone with him I'll call her back. Well our conversation lasts for like 2 hours and after my walk I come home only to be greeted by a cussing out from Melissa. ""What the fuck were you thinking!?"" Oh God, she's turned into my mother! Then she starts in about me somehow running from my problems. What the fuck was I running from? She was being a bitch and so I went on a walk to clear my head so I didn't snap at her. I thought I was being mighty considerate but apparently not. Good God this girl is bipolar! You probably think I'm kidding but I'm not. She's gone mental since we've been here. I don't know what to do. She gets moody over the littlest things. And before she used to say that her parents would get mad at her over nothing but I'm totally on her parents' side now. Thins girl is a one-woman circus! Ugh, I can't take it! All I know is that I'm very grateful that she's at work today (7am-6:30pm) and I can get all my homework done and she probably won't bother me about going out tonight with the guys. They can do their own thing but I've had plenty of Melissa time since I've been here and right now I just need to be alone. They can have her."

Anyways, Melissa and I went to our first college party here in Boise. You know, even though my girls in Hawaii can tell you stories of me getting drunk, high, and stupid as all hell, I'm not much of a partier these days. But alas we got all dolled up and went. We wore tight business suits, white collared shirt buttoned up half way, bright red bras showing breasts gallore, long thin ties, glasses, and tight pants. We were hoe-ish secretaries. And fuck did we look hot! So we get to the party and are immediately greeted by a big group of guys who decide to grab us, smack our asses, pick us up, and take us to the bar for a drink. Nice welcoming I must say. Then once we were there, our friend Kate introduces us to Dan the priest, Chris the cowboy, Aaron the Greaser, Maximus (forgot his name), Timmy the Penis, Talaban the hippie, and a few other guys who immediately decide they're going to take body shots from our bras. Well, poor little Mel didn't have anything to hold up the shot glasses and so they all dive into my bra fishing for tequila. It was a little erotic to have that many guys licking my breasts and my neck but we're not going to go into that... :)

Then we head outside to the keg and do some keg stands (my first ever!). You know, I'm not much of a beer girl, but that beer was so yummy! So we had a few glasses of beer, then had a few shots, and then we were ready to party. Melissa ended up fucking around with a married guy, and I stayed virtuous with a priest (Adam would not have approved). So after a few hours of blurry memories, we called up Brian and went home to find that he made us pancakes and waffles because he knew we'd be hungry after a night of drinking. How sweet is he?? So yeah, much fun this weekend.

But Brian told me he just sees Mel as a friend, Mel tells me she's over him since he's not her type anyway, and yet I get in trouble for helping Brian out with the girl he DOES like. Mel is pissed that I would ""betray"" her by giving Brian tips on how to put the moves on Nicole, probably one of the sweetest girls I've ever met and one who's PERFECT for him. I told Mel she shouldn't tell me that she's over him and that she just sees him as a friend if she doesn't want me to give him friendly advice on how to innocently hit on her. But she's still pissed. Whatever.

Oh, and since Mel's been so desperate for a guy, I hooked her up with a guy we went to high school with who's been madly in love with her since he frist laid eyes on her. She was all exicted at first, but now she's backing out saying things like ""Well do your eally see us long term? I mean, is he the type of guy I'd marry?"" I'm so lost. I'm finding her a boyfriend, not a fucking husband. She's still not happy no matter what I do and I'm so frustrated. Her life is nothing but drama. I swear, she's an enormous soap opera in a little size 3 package. It's so tiring trying to keep up with her, I need a break. I'm so glad that Adam is coming today, he can whisk me away and rescue me from this sudsy hell. Yay!

Hopefully the TA's in there know a thing or two about what we're doing because I don't. This week is going to be horrid, 2 midterms, calc homework on Wed, Affluenza discussion on Wed, 2 speechs in Comm on Thur, paper to write for Comm, workshop with inst on Fri, and then thankfully the weekend. I might go home to see Adam, but I've already surprised him once, so the idea is still up in the air. 

Also just spent a fortune in car maintainance. I had to get new tires (my others were practically bald), new brakes (I couldn't handle the squeaking anymore), new air filter, wash, wax, etc. It was due for a good tune up, too bad it set me back several hundreds of dollars, but the guys were really nice to me, didn't take advantage of me (I knew what I wanted) and now my car purrs like a kitten.

I never did, I thought that was a wonderful part of the redheaded package, but apparently I have ""wife"" written all over my forehead. I talked about it to the boy and he says he totally got ahead of himself. Thank god he admits it.

All they have to do is program the number into a database that prevents them from reaching my cell phone and yet they say it's impossible. I say this only because the last 2 days I've gotten about 8 calls from some random ass number in California who likes to call me at odd hours of the morning. Usually around 2:30-6 am and wake my ass up well before any decent hour. I don't know what to do, I called them back politely requesting they not call my phone seeing as how I know no one from Beverly Hills/LA, and yet they persist, completely ignoring I even asked. So in efforts to stop this complete JACKASS from calling me anymore, all of you out there reading this feel free to call the number (310) 497-5293 and show my appreciation for all of their ""prank"" calls.

And finally, after 4 months of being jerked around like a ragdoll my loan came in. $12,000 beautiful dollars and I am no longer receiving threatening letters from the school telling me I'll be kicked out, but rather thank you notes for paying my balance. And since they screwed up my loans in the first place, I contested all of the late charges I was being penalized for and the board sided with me and withdrew the charges. Yay!!! So now I am extremely happy.

Oh, and now that Aaron and I are no longer a couple, he doesn't talk to me. At all. So I email him asking if he and I were suddenly on non-speaking terms and if not would he please talk to me and I finally get a response from that man. He says that he loves me, always will, and that nothing will ever change that. Also, that if I want friendship I can call Adam. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I took it as either I have a full-blown relationship with Aaron or nothing at all, not even a friendship. And so I write him back asking him to explain himself and whether or not he thinks a platonic friendship is possible between the two of us. Needless to say, I haven't heard back from him. I do miss him though. Not in the romantic way, but just the closeness we had before I moved to Boise. I am completely happy with Adam and don't mean what I said as me wanting them both, but Aaron was my first real relationship and I still want him in my life, even if it's just as a friend. I know that's completely selfish of me, I broke his heart and then plan on stringing him along by being ""just friends"" but I can't help it. He was such a big part of my life and now he's gone. I'm so pathetic, listen to me. ""I have a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and also an ex boyfriend who still loves me but please feel sorry for me because I can't have what I want."" I'm so sad.

He was so shocked and excited to see me it was great. We spent all weekend together and got to meet the family (his) and next time (Turkey Day) he'll get to meet mine. I'm nervous but not. It'll be fine.

Anyways, too tired to finish this. Later.

******************************************************************************

Ok, as I was saying last night before I completely passed out, my weekend home was wonderful. Melissa and I left Friday morning after she took a test and I skipped english, and hit the road. We passed through Portland/Kalama after an incredibly quick trip -- only 6.5 hrs instead of the usual 8. I spent a few hours with my mom and then headed north. 

Shae (Adam's goddaughter) was so excited to meet me. We hooked up at the Auburn mall before we headed over to her house to hide me before Adam arrived. He was floored. He walked into the house and there I was and all he could do was laugh, smile, and stare at me for about 10 minutes. He's so damn cute. But then he and I had the night to ourselves since the girls (Shae and her friend Jessi) secretely made plans for us to be alone. Such sweet girls. So we caught up on all the 'happenings' in our lives and then passed out after an incredible romp in bed.

Then the rest of my weekend was pretty much made up of spending my mornings/afternoons with the family and my evenings with Adam. I did run into a ton of people who found out I was in town (old work friends, and IOR girls) so it was nice to see them as well. I was just excited to see Adam. Crazy guy said he didn't have any plans this weekend and so we spent most of it together. Then I find out he really DID have shit going on but put it all off until next week so he could see me. I feel so loved :)

But now Mel and I are back to the grind in Boise. Am completely exhausted from the trip (10.5 hrs there, 8.5 back, w/avg of 4hrs per night of sleep) and so I predict these next few days will consist of catching up on my sleep inbetween classes and homework. Bring it on."

I called him up today after Financial Aid didn't help me and he gave me direct access to my account at Wachovia. He told me the stipulations I was approved under, why, what I need to do to finalize my application and loan, and approximately how long it will take. I've tried contacting Fin. Aid and Wachovia several times over the past 2 weeks for this and all it took was Manny working his magic. I swear, I could marry that man right now. So I should be approved by tomorrow and if BSU get's it's ass in line I can have my loan by this weekend. Oh, and I'll also get to keep the $2,000 refund I'll get since I used my savings to cover everything that the loan should've since I first moved here. So that will be nice...having money again. But yeah, that is all worked out.

Oh, and Mel and I have decided to go home this weekend. It's her Ma's birthday and since we both don't have any classes Friday and Monday, we decided to be extra sneaky and show up back home. I'll surprise Adam and Shae at a footy game and Mel will surprise her parents with a flower bouquet for Mom and taking them out for dinner. Plus, it will be nice to be home again. Just for sentimental reasons and the fact that our parents will give us everything under the sun so we can save on groceries and toiletries for awhile. Home sweet home.

Speaking of Mel, she's been rather stressed out and pissy lately. I feel bad because her instructors love to assign 100 pages of reading regularly along with papers, quizzes, reading responses and tests and my teachers don't really do that stuff. Granted, I did get 2 10 page papers assigned to me last week (one of which is rough-draft completed already, and the other already 3/4 researched on -- Go Red!) and also have regular quizzes and such, but I have a more lax schedule. So since I feel bad, I offer to do her math homework (I'm in calculus and she's in basic, it'll get done fast) but she refuses telling me that even if I took notes she needs to do it herself or else she won't learn it.

You don't even know what's important to note so how will you be able to take good notes?"", ""Um, sweetie, I don't have to understand the jargon to pick out the important topics and summarize."", ""Whatever, I'll do it myself."", ""Ok, well then let me find some research for your ephinography paper."", ""Trust me, if I can't find anything, neither will you. Don't bother."" And then she bitches about how much shit she has to do and how she's never going to get it done and it irritates me. She won't let me help her in any way unless it's to write her 10 page paper and I don't really feel like writing a paper for her when I just wrote one and have to write another one myself. That's the only thing I refused to do for her and she's bitter about it. Oh well, she's going to have to learn how to manage her time and classes. I'm doing just fine...just finished a bunch of calc homework, wrote my paper, read for comm 101 quiz, wrote a 4 page reading response for english, decorated a shirt for the footy games, researched for english research paper, did univ assignments and have completely finished all homework that's due this week. Mel's being rude about it and saying that if she didn't have a life either she'd be able to finish all her work as well. I laugh because I actually hang out with people OTHER than my roommate, attend school sporting events, see a tutor, attend study groups, juggle 2 boyfriends (now it's just one though), work on the side, only one of which she does, and I'M the one without a life. Right Mel, right. With the study groups and tutors she wonders why I get good grades and get my work done. Hmm, not really hard to figure out. Work before you play. I learned that in Hawaii."

"event","Oh my GOD! I swear, as much as I love my school, I want to strangle them! This is the second time they've fucked up my loans. The second time! I had everything taken care of back in MAY and my school decides not to send certification that I'm a student and so my bank drops my loan. Ok, no big deal, just reapply. So I reapply and get approved for a second loan and my school decided that I'm not an actual student at their school and notifies my bank telling them that I'm trying to commit fraud and identity theft. WHAT THE FUCK?!?! You fucking Idahoans! So after spending a very heated hour and a half in the financial aid office I finally got things straightened out between my school and the bank and it will still take about 2 weeks to process my loan thanks to the potato fuckwits and I will be charged a late fee since I'll miss the tuition deadline. And on top of that, I just got assigned 2 10 page essays due next week. One is a research paper for english and the other a research-type paper on the leagl system in Idaho for my business law class. I am so tired and worn out I just want to cry. Damn, first I break up with one of my boyfriends, then I get told I'm getting kicked out of school, then I find out that ANOTHER job interview was a waste, then my loan has been declined due to illegal actions on my part, then trying to finance 2 trips home for the holidays with no money. Ugh, stress takes an ugly toll on me and right now I'm VERY stressed...not to mention not at my prettiest :) I think right now I'm just going to grab a few beers, read a book, watch a movie, and be thankful that it's Friday. Mmmm, fat tire."

"event","So I didn't get the marketing job I interviewed for. I'm not too surprised since it was to represent the entire company throughout Boise, Meridian and Nampa but it would've been such a great opportunity. Oh well, it was good experience to take part in such a great interview (they were SO intimidating!). But there are a couple other marketing positions available and so I've contacted the managers and might get a spot on the tour.

Also found out that Kristi had an ovarian cancer scare. They went ahead and took everything out and now she can't have any more kids (Maddison's gonna be it). It's sad since she and Shane were trying so hard for a baby but I guess everything happens for a reason. 

Oh, and Roger is getting married. Yeah, the same Roger who fucked my sister over royally by getting her pregnant, racking over $10,000 on her credit cards then running off and cheating on her. So the girl he's supposedly marrying is the girl he left her for. I just thank God that he never signed papers or put his name on Cayden's birth certificate. Such a waste.

And Aaron is coming out to see me this weekend. I had the worst week I've had in awhile and so it freaked him out a little with me being so 'weird' and so he's making a short trip up here to settle me down a bit. I mean, I think I'm ok but Mel said she was a little worried too so I guess it must be something I'm not fully aware of. Oh well. At least I get to see him and that's always a plus. I just hope it's not one of those weekends where he tries to get all super serious...might just have to put a stop to that. Baby steps, it's all about the baby steps."

"event","My god I'm so glad it's the weekend! Now I can turn off my phone, lock my door, and just stay in bed and not be bothered by anymore stupid people. I swear, these Idahoan people are a lot more presistant than I orignally gave them credit for. For example: last night Mel was working and so I had the apartment to myself. I get a knock on the door from the guys across the hall wondering if Mel and I wanted to go out with a bunch of people from our building. Seeing as how all the people in our building are complete fuckwits, I say ""no thanks"" and close the door. An hour later they come back, this time letting themselves in when I don't answer the door right away. ""Now there's only a few of us since you didn't really click with the other crowd"". Are you serious? Waiting outside of my apartment are about 8 guys, no girls, all dressed up to Idaho's version of high hell waiting for some ""breasts"" to accompany them out on the town. ""Guys, we're only 20, we can't get into the bars you want, plus, my roommates at work and neither of us are single."" ""Ok, then get ready and we'll take YOU out."" ""Ok, let me make myself VERY CLEAR, I have no intention of going out with you or any of your friends. Nor will my roommate. Please leave."" So they get kinda pissy and leave only to tap on my window about 30 mins later. ""Ami, we REALLY want you to come with us."" ""GO THE FUCK AWAY!!!""

And then I get a call from this guy who I had worked in a workshop together with earlier on that morning (at the beginning of the workshop you exchange #s with your partner in case you'd like to continue your convo after it's over). It was a sexual health workshop where you share little tidbits of any kind with people (ie positions, safe practices, oral tricks, etc) and you get free breakfast a condoms. It was really fun, but the guy who I was partnered with is a sexual freak, and I mean FREAK! He's telling me all these kinky stories of him and his wife, then his fantasies of being fucked by a guy and a girl at the same time, and all this other shit. Damn, and I thought I had a wild side! So then he's asking me about all my experiences and favorite positions and what the kinkiest thing I've ever done (along with the nastiest) and since the workshop leader (this crazy old bat with a PhD in every aspect of sex you could possibly think of) was standing right there listening to everything we were talking about I went ahead and told him. To my fucking surprise, the sick bastard was getting off under the table. He almost covered my feet in cum! I was horrified, no one else was being so perverted about it! Only him. Lucky fucking me. And so I get up almost ready to smack the guy and leave. He follows me out saying ""Ami! Where are you going? I thought we were going to get together and ""talk"" some more."" Ewww, ewww, ewww. So I bolted out of that place as fast as I could forgetting that I left my contact information on the table we were at. Fuck. So he calls me up and I had completely forgotten his name. Gerald. I remember now. And he asks for me and Mel hands me the phone and once I say ""hello"" he goes off. Sick mother fucker wanting to have phone sex and listen to me ""cum"". Ewww. What's wrong with these people? I swear, I thought Kalama was bad but apparently being stuck out in the middle of B fucking E is a lot worse. Not much to entertain yourselves but to fuck and fuck some more. I can't wait until Mel gets home, at least I'll have 1 normal person to hang out with. Ugh, I need a shower."

"event","Yesterday was my last day of work. I know that I've probably bitched about it and my coworkers a few times, but I really love my job. It's easy, the money's awesome, my coworkers are great (for the most part), and I get to be in Seattle everyday. I had a hard time saying goodbye to my boss. We've gotten so close this past year it's going to be hard not seeing her everyday. But we're going to go out in style this weekend before I head down south and run amock our last night out. I'm so looking forward to it.

Also, Adam is getting slightly attached. Ever since he broke things off with his girlfriend he's been wanting to ""hang out"" about 4 nights a week, which usually means I crash at his place and we spend 4 days in a row with each other. He's great, don't get me wrong, but he's starting to call me ""babe"" and ""sweetheart"" which is completely inappropriate for even a friends-with-benefits relationship. He told me that it's going to take him a long while to get used to not having me in his bed at night. I laughed (seeing as how I hate his bed and usually refuse to sleep on it and opt for the floor) but it made me a little uncomfortable that he's telling me these things. I mean, we've been friends since January, have had strong feelings for one another since then, and have only voiced those feelings since his breakup with Cindy (2.5 weeks ago). It's not exactly what I'd call a serious romance. I've even told him that after I leave that things have to go back the way they were. You know, still friends but no sleeping in the same bed at night, no pet names (unless they're part of an innocent inside joke), and most of all no emotional...stuff. I don't think I can handle him telling me that the entire time he was with Cindy he wanted to be with me, or his brother telling me that Adam's never been happier with any other woman, or that he wishes that I'd stay here so we can ""be together"". It makes me feel so bad that he's feeling this way, because yeah, when we first told each other how we felt I definitely wanted to be in a relationship with him, but now it's different. He's so wonderful, but not what I'd want in a boyfriend. I thought he'd see the same in me but he's only gotten more attached. I need to ween him from the redhead. We're supposed to hang out tonight but I think I'm going to hang out with my friend Jodi just to get a little separation from him. I hope he doesn't think I'm avoiding him, though it is pretty much what I'm doing, but I need to spend my last few days with my OTHER friends and loved ones, you know? Hopefully he'll understand but if not, oh well.

And Aaron is definitely not liking my spending time with other guys. Even though we're not exclusively together yet, he still feels like we are. I get this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach like I'm cheating on him, but seeing as how we've never even been together, I'm not. I don't know, it's just that I don't want to hurt him and I know that he'd be crushed if he found out that Adam and I have more than just an innocent friendship. Oh well, if he asks I'll tell him the truth--that Adam and I have been together and have feelings for each other--but I just won't tell him the specific details, such as when. I'll sugar coat it to make it seem like it was when we first started working together but I can't lie to him so if he asks I'll have to tell him. Let's just hope that he doesn't. 

My brother has/had skin cancer as well. He didn't want to tell us seeing as how my entire family is the overprotective type and we'd be really upset, but I guess they cut it all out and have finished up with treatment. They're not sure if it's completely gone yet, they still have to run more tests, but they said they're about 95% sure they got it all. Scary. 

I got to spend some time with Nycole as well. Her abortion went well...she didn't successfully miscarry and so they had to take matters into their own hands and abort before her condition got life threatening. But she and her boyfriend are engaged now. I'm not really sure when it happened seeing as how she and I rarely talk, but they're as happy as little clams. Melissa, Mary and I will all be gone by the time she gets home (estimated as around the 26th of this month) but that's ok as long as she gets out of Ft Lewis. I know her family will be grateful she's home. But unfortunately TJ won't get out for a long time to come. He's still in Med-hold due to an injury caused to his back after being thrown from his tank in Iraq, but they'll be ok. I hope.

Anyways, enough BSing on my LJ and time to get back to packing. Sue, I'll give you a call either when I get into Boise or after Aaron's visit and we can talk. Miss you girl. Also, Cody keep your head up and if you need someone to talk to just holler at me. Later everyone."

Even when her parents (so uptight they'd have a stroke if a guy set foot in our place) are out there with us, he'll be at our place. I love saying that.... ""our place"". But he and I had the talk about me not really having the relationship vibe with our situation and he was ok with it. He told me that he got that feeling from me and that it's ok, since we're not together right now anyway. Plus he totally understood how it was hard for me to go from strictly friends and only seeing each other like 5-6 times to being in a relationship. But he's ok with it. Which makes me feel totally at ease. But once we're together things will be completely different, I can't hardly wait. I miss him so much.

Oh, and Adam has broken up with his girlfriend. They'd been together for a year and just broke up like it was nothing. He'd been trying to get a hold of me for about 2 weeks and I gave him the runaround thinking he'd want me to hang out with him and his girlfriend (barf!). But then I finally gave in and called him and things went from there. It's weird being together outside of work but when we are together it's disgustingly fun. I had such a great time with him and he smelled delicious I could have just eaten him up right there! Yum...    Of course there's more to this story but I'm gonna keep it private. It'll be mine and Adam's story for us only. Ha ha. Bad redhead."

I was very surprised to find this. Hmmm, makes me curious as to what ""your love"" is supposed to mean. Oh well, it was a sweet sentiment nonetheless.

Work was awful tonight!!! We had to drive all the way out in BFE to the Gorge ampitheater for the Warp Tour (???) and work a 20 hour shift! It was absolute hell. Not to sound judgemental or anything, but the people there scared me. Not to say that they were freaks or anything, that'd be so mean, just that I got an unsettling vibe from the majority of the crowd. My coworkers felt it too and so it was a long and tiring night. But it's all good. I made over $300 so who can complain? But luckily I only have one more day of this tour before it's over and it's not until Wednesday so I have a nice few days to sit back and relax before going back. Also was pleased to find an email from Meliza with an entirely new list of agencies to work for -- some even based out of Boise. Hopefully I can find another job just like this once I get over there on the 15th. Will have to keep my fingers crossed.

"event","After a total Nycole bashing session this last week I got a call from her telling me she's pregnant. I wasn't completely surprised seeing as how she and her man fuck like wild rabbits and she's not on any BC. But I guess her body is rejecting it and it's fucking her up royally. She's cramping, spitting up blood, puking all the time...usual miscarriage symptoms. So I feel a little badly for saying she's the flakiest person I've ever met but the feeling still stands. Only hear from her when she needs something so my bitchiness is supported by total facts. I'm still mean though.

And got a call from Reed today. He's in town for the weekend and wants to ""get together"". His idea of getting together is going out for a few hours and then going back to his place and fucking before he goes back to the wife and kids. Unfortunately for him I'm no bootycall and/or mistress so he's out of luck. I may see him though just to get on base and check on Nycole. If I have to fool him into getting me there it's his own danm fault for getting used when he's trying to fuck over his wife. Shame on him not me! 

Oh and much more man drama on this end -- surprise, surprise! Aaron has practically done everything to say ""I love you"" without actually saying those 3 words. He's completely moved out here and has bought a house I told him I thought was gorgeous because he ""wants me to be comfortable in his home..."" then he said something about it becoming mine as well one day but I tried to tune that part out. He's coming out to Boise once Mel and I get settled and is planning on being with me for Thanksgiving and taking me to Greece for Christmas. Maybe it's just me but the whole long distance relationships just don't do it for me. I mean, I care for the man dearly but it's just hard when we're so far away. And also, I'm only 20 years old. I'm not ready to settle down and be a wife. He's the first guy I've ever thought seriously about and I want the option to get my heart broken and then to break some hearts before I commit to someone. He says he's completely going to let me do my own thing in Boise and he'll be the understanding boyfriend on the side but I don't really want the thought of him waiting for me to be on my mind. I know I'll always be thinking...""What would Aaron do if I did this? Or would we be over if this happened?"" You know? It's not fair to either of us, but especially to him since he's given a lot more than I have (emotionally, career-wise, and fuck....he bought a house closer to me!). I think I just need to have one of those heart-to-heart talks with him before I get out there just to get on the same level with him. I need to know what I can and cannot do in Boise and still have him there. Hmm, maybe a call tomorrow night to sort things out. I'm keeping my fingers croseed."

But for some other people they can get angry, depressed, happy or even be completely unphased. I think of this because my sweet, sweet grandpa finally passed away on Sunday morning after fighting cancer for about a year. He was suffering so much and so his death was good for him, but really hard on the family. We're all really tight at the moment, and everybody from that side of the family is in town (over 50 people from all over the country). I'm excited for his memorial because it's going to be just what he'd want -- casual but warm and inviting, centered around our family, outside, and upbeat.

I'm a manager now for a few days on a promotional tour up here and there's so much shit you have to go through and put up with it's not even funny. I SO do not envy my boss at all, I've only had to go through a bit of it, she has to put up with this for months on end, it's too much for me and I'll be glad when these next 2 weeks are over.

I think my gramps is going to get set up with hospice care since the doctors have tried everything and he's not getting any better. I just hope that he stays around longs enough for me to go to school because if I'm here I won't be able to handle it. It's my weird and completely selfish grieving process. I need to be alone in order to function in times like that. Let's see....I've got 2 months and 11 days left. Shit, I don't think he'll make it that long.

But work has been going fantastic lately. Made about $200 yesterday for about 4 hours work. It was wonderful! And Anni has been sending my resume around to all the major companies back east and so I've been getting a lot of calls for upcoming tours in Seattle/Portland/San Francisco/Spokane. I'm tempted to take on the Coke promo but we'll see. Maybe I'll just be the field manager for Anni, who knows?

Oh and Melissa graduates Clark on the 9th. All four of us girls will be in town and so I'm trying to set up a time where we can all get together and go out. We haven't all gotten together in at least 1.5 years so this should be interesting. I just hope I can arrange it all.

Aaron has also invited me to his family's celebration for his dad's birthday this summer. It's in Northern Colorado and his entire family will be there. Unfortunately so will my grandpa and grandma on my dad's side of the family (which I haven't seen since I was about 12) and so I'll have to stay here and spend time with them. I wish I could do both but family comes first and so I'll have to make another trip to Colorado to see them all. Maybe a week in Cheyenne? I'll have to see."

There was so much blood that the doctors were worried about her (lost 21 lbs in two days after Cayden's birth!) but she's doing really well. She's really healthy and is adapting to being a new mother. I'm just so excited because there's a ton of family members all ready and willing to play babysitter.

He was letting everyone else kick back and hang out and was trying to make me do all the shit work.

He's very.....blunt. But his bluntness has no tact to it whatsoever. He doesn't care if he insults anyone but if they insult him, watch out! Shit hits the fan then. After just one night, I can honestly say that I'm disappointed but relieved at the same time. I think that Stem is right, I'm not the type of person who'll committ to one person easily. He says that I refuse to settle for anything other than the best. I don't know, sometimes I think I'm too picky, but then when I'm not, I always end up with such jerks. Doesn't a person deserve to be picky? I mean, don't I deserve to end up with someone who'll be good to me, someone who'll be faithful, someone who treasures what we've got together? Call me crazy, but I think something like that shouldn't be settled for. It should be something you fight tooth and nail to get and something you'd rather die for in order to keep. If that's such a problem then I guess I'm the one who's got my wires crossed, not everyone else. Hmmm, gives me something to think about. 

Oh well, Jay's history but there's still Rob to hang out with. Everything is great between the two of us and we're gonna hang out on Wednesday night. I think we'll just hit the movies or something like that, just something easy to where he can get off base. 

And also got Matt's graduation invitation today. I was so happy to get it and am thinking of possibly flying out for his graduation. I think it'd be a nice surprise. Another thing to think about over the next few weeks."

"event","I have the entire house to myself and 3 cars at my disposal. Oh the trouble I could get into. My family has left for Boise for the weekend and I'm here by myself to hold down the fort and to work (like usual). Our day in Seattle was cancelled due to torrential rains that flooded parts of the freeway even. No way in hell we're working in weather like that, even us Washingtonians. But it was ok with me since I got all kinds of errands done in the meantime. Now I'm just waiting on the weekend and a possible night out with Rob. Nothing romantic, seeing as how that's the last thing I need right now, but it should be fun nonetheless. He's a southerner and so I'm gonna take him to dinner in the Space Needle and then to Alki beach afterwards. I know it sounds all romantic and shit but I swear those are places HE wanted to go, not me. I'm just providing the tour and the transportation. It's still in the works but possibly not gonna happen due to a rough night on my part. Long story but I think he's been offended by my airheadedness. It happens but I think I may need to smooth the bumps out with this one. Sorry there Robby.

Then there's Jay, what to say about that one? Hmmm, he's not the kind of guy I'd ever date but he's cool to hang out with, and his sense of humor is so twisted I can't help but laugh at him 24/7. My dad always asks me why I don't ever hang out with normal girls instead of ""crazy guys"" and I don't know what to say. The girls don't respond well to me here and the guys do. What can I say? I'm at a loss."

"event","Was highly looked down upon by the Sexy Bitch for my mischevious escapades last week. Out of all people, how could HE act weird about it?! I mean, I understand not telling Melissa, she'd flip, but Matt? I don't get it. He's supposed to be all turned on and asking questions but he just asked questions and said....""Huh. Well I guess you....huh. Whatever. I guess whatever you like....I guess. If you're fine with it then I guess it's fine."" Ha ha ha! Then he says that when I was in Hawaii I made everyone think I was all sweet and innocent and I'm not like that at all. I couldn't help but laugh because what people choose to think about me is their own doing. I can't make a person think something of me if they don't want to. He thinks I have people under some false sense of ""Ami"". I say that whoever thought I was the innocent little Angel didn't know me as well as they thought. And I find it highly disturbing that he would act in such a manner as to look down on me for doing something he always talks about doing. Sorry I don't talk shit that I can't back up. That's not me. But he's all weird about things now. He wonders why we never slept together in Hawaii (your choice Matt!) and why I never hooked up with anyone. I think everyone in Johnson could answer that --- I was in love with him and didn't want him to see me with another guy. Mystery solved. And now he knows that I actually date and have sex and have a life and he's weird about it. It makes no sense to me. He acts like it's ok to have sex with him on his terms but it's bad and dirty for me to have sex with anyone else. Yeah, like my girls say ""Aint no dick that good!"" Ha ha!

And have finally taken a stand at work. Found out that one of my bosses who tried fucking me over last month has been telling all the new people we hired that he's gonna cut my hours way back and then give them all to the new girls. I work full time and for him to cut any hours of mine he better damn well talk to me about it beforehand. So I confront him on it and he starts babbling about how he meant they'd take my hours after I had left in the fall and that I didn't need to worry about my hours getting cut anytime soon. Right! Jodi told me he wanted to start her on my hours NEXT WEEK! I told him this too and he didn't know what to say. And so I told him that if he's thinking of cutting my hours then he'd better talk to me FIRST or else he'd better not bother putting me on the schedule at all because I was sick of putting up with all the shit that comes along with working at that place. He was at a loss for words, which is fine with me, and I walked away. So I get a call yesterday morning from him telling me he's cutting my hours in HALF!!! Fuck you Pat, and so I quit. It was beautiful. Then I had another job offer the same afternoon that pays me double what I'm making down there from a different sporting complex in Fife and Pat's pissed because all my customers that I take care of know I'm leaving and he thinks they'll leave PSC too. He's trying to get me to come back saying he'll pay me more but it's never gonna happen. Fuck you Pat!

So also found out Adam has a girlfriend. Funny how I'm a magnet for unavailable men. I'm so sick of it. I meet all these great guys but they've all got girlfriends or wives. I swear, I think I have ""fling"" or ""future mistress"" on my forehead. But oh well. I have met a fabulous gay guy today who likes to hug and be all cuddly but is just like having a girl around. It's like you get the affection of a guy but the good times of your closest girlfriend. It's too fun. So he and I are going to hit the clubs this weekend. He's taking me to his favorite one downtown and introduce me to all his ""bitches"". Should be much fun and I'm highly looking forward to it. Plus I get to work with him in Seattle and so we can hang out during and after work. Should be fun. 

So, enough news for now. Take care my lovelies on the island and I'll call when I get some more free time."

"event","Got a surprise delivery for Nycole today at my work. I don't know why it was sent there c/o Me, but maybe this will give her incentive to return my phone calls. If not, then I'll keep the package for myself. Ha ha ha, I'm so evil but oh well. Am forced to return to the regular routine tomorrow. Super bummed about that but my sick days are coming to an end and I gotta get back to making the money. Anni booked me up until June and so the paychecks should be rolling in steadily, but it's gonna be a busy few months. Lucky me. 

Completely lost all train of thought as to what I was on here to write. Maybe it will come back to me later. Until then xxx"

"event","I find that putting time and effort into things is pretty much useless anymore. I try so hard at work to get the highest sales position and end up empty handed as Pat decides to be the ultimate prick. Then I try to be creative and thoughtful to plan a night/weekend for Nycole and I to be able to hang out and have our time to catch up on all the shit we've missed in the past year and because I passed out in her friends room for like 2 hours she thinks we fucked and now won't return my calls. Then I actually meet some guys who I think one of which I can actually start something with....not! Out of 4 men, 2 are married with kids, one has a girlfriend and the other is super sweet but I'm so exhausted by the results of the other 3 that I don't even want to bother because I know it'll end up shitty. I'm so physically and emotionally fucked up right now it's pointless to try anything new that I'd wish to keep around. 

I stayed at Ft Lewis for 3 days.....such an interesting stay. I had a ""group experience"".....ha ha ha. I'm such a hoe. I don't know what came over me while I was there but I doubled my number of sexual partners in a matter of a few hours. I know that the starting number wasn't high, but still...one night. Fuck me. Those were the guys who turned out to be married. YEAH! I didn't find out until after we'd hooked up but it's all good. They were great in the sack and a girl's gotta get hers too so I guess I can't complain. They're both going back home this week though (Brian tomorrow morning and Bret in a day or two). I will miss Brian though. We actually became friends and it sucks that he's going home in the morning. I mean, it's good but it's kinda sad at the same time. He'll be back at Ft Lewis a couple weekends a month and so I can see him then but it'll only be a few days. Oh well, he's got a wife. Just remember that Ami, he's got a wife.

Oh! And finally had that dinner that Adam thought he owed me and found out he's got a girlfriend as well. I was confused because all of the flirting that goes on between the two of us but yeah....I guess he's got a girlfriend. I'm bummed out because Adam is such a cool guy, he makes me laugh hysterically, he's fucking hot, and he lives close by too. I guess that's what I get for trying to take advantage of hot coworkers. But we're still going to get together now and then to hang out. Who knows? I'm over it though. I'm over the whole trying to get a quality guy thing. I think I'm just gonna wait until I get over to Boise to try to find a guy. I know I always say shit like that about me waiting but I'm really frustrated right now. Where are all the single guys at? Besides my work....those guys won't do. Urgh....stupid boys!

Anyways, this sicko is going to bed. I think I came down with the flu and so I'm going to drug myself and then hit the sack. G'night everyone!"

"event","Ft Lewis is now my new favorite place to be. I was there all of Wednesday and met some of the coolest people. I went there to see Nycole and spent time with her, Nader and Reed. The 3 of them were great and we had a lot of fun. I'm going to be seeing her on Sunday too for my sister's baby shower and I'm going to try to talk her into coming back to Puyallup with me (maybe steal the guys too) so I can take them all out to dinner. I'm not sure how'd they react to a restaurant with things other than burgers but I'll see what I can do.

Happy Birthday Sue! I hope you have a blast and am looking forward to hearing all your stories. Love you girl!

Anyways, much to do (bed for one thing) and so I'll write more later on. Love Ami"

"event","I was told by Adam tonight that I'm the reason he's working at PSC. What? I'm the reason you stayed after the first week? How can I be that influential? I mean, all I did was take care of him and his clients and got him a few lessons. It's my job. I get paid to do that. The guys would have done the same thing....ok they wouldn't, but it's their job too. Now I can't help but think about what's going on. It makes me rethink the whole dinner repayment thing. I mean, I don't regret telling him I'd go to dinner with him, I just regret thinking it isn't anything. Although it probably isn't anything, I still have this feeling that it's just a friends thing. But after today and talking with him about things other that work I get another impression. Does that make any sense? *sigh* I hardly ever make any sense, what am I thinking? But he's always telling me how wonderful I am and how much he's looking forward to working with me outside of PSC (I live in the town he's working in) and now he tells me this. ""If it wasn't for you, I would never had stayed."" Hmmm...I only see him once a week (about 3-4 times now) and I'm supposedly the reason. Weird.

Anyways, I won the sales competition at work. I sold over $45,000 last month and now Pat's refusing to let me have the reward he promised us. It was a pair of Oakleys. So I told him if he didn't feel comfortable giving me merchandise, then he could just give me a raise and he laughed in my face and told me ""That's never going to happen."" So I shot back, ""Then neither is me selling twice then all the others combined. Count me out on all sales and maybe I'll look for another job who appreciates good employees."" He just kind of studdered and didn't know what to say. Quin couldn't help but laugh and told Pat I had a point and he was pissed. He told me he'd talk to me about it tomorrow and he said it in a very nasty tone and so if he gets pissed then I'm gone. I know that Anni wants me to work with her full time and the money is great. I get paid twice the amount Pat pays me and so it's not something I'd have to be stubborn with. I'm very tempted to have a little chat with her. I just don't know though. Although the pay is great, I get a little overwhelmed with that job. I have to be on the streets all day and I don't get the interaction with people as I do with PSC. It's just something I'll have to figure out in the next month or so but I bet I'll just cave into Pat and PSC. I always do. Such a pushover. Fuck.

Ok, well I have another 11 hour shift tomorrow and so I better go to bed. A hui hou everyone!"

"event","I'm still on the 2 week vacay, yet I'm ready to go back. I still have until next Thursday off, but I can't seem to find anything to keep me busy for that long. Mel, Erin, Paul and I all went to Boise and had a fabulous 3 days there. We saw the sights (not many, but that's ok), took many tours around campus, snuck onto the field and faked like we were playing football on the blue turf, hung out with the gymnasts in the arena, tried to learn how to balance on the beam before falling too many times, met BEAUTIFUL country boys who taught us a few chords on the guitar, and now I'm back home. It's raining full force and the river is flooding. We were going through a drought only a few weeks ago and now we're making up for it. Luckily my house isn't in any danger spots, but the river is crazy! We were going to go tubing (we've ridden this river for about 15 years, no worries) but the current underneath is too strong and we decided to pass until the rain lets up a little. 

But now I'm just doing a little spring cleaning in my room until the old folks get here and we celebrate Easter. I made my niece Maddison an Easter basket and it's overflowing with goodies. I hope she likes it. But am going home tonight (back up to Puyallup) and will visit Bellingham and Western Washington University while I'm there. Oh, and while I was at Boise I found out many secret ways of getting around the evil FAFSA people and so may be going to Boise in the fall after all. Will have to wait and see what becomes of that situation. 

But we got a new guy at my work. He and I talked on the phone before we met (calling to talk about shifts, clients, and so forth) and so when we met we were already friends. So, he's never worked with a business that's actually organized and knows how to handle things and so when I went about my daily work and routine, he was amazed and grateful for me setting him up with new clients (about 5) and lots of appointments. So the next time I saw him he tells me that he owes me dinner and is taking me out on my next day off. The guys tell me it's inappropriate and that coworkers shouldn't be dating but it's not a date, it's his way of paying me back for the business I brought his program. Hmmm, seems easy enough for me. They're just protective of us girls, it's kinda cute!

Ok, mom's bitching in my ear and so I gotta go. Talk to you all later. Love Ami"

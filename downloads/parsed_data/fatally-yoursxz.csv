and talked on the phone with them.
and hung out with Bradie, who is 6.
and the cutest kid i have ever seen in my entire life.
she drew all over my hands on the way home.

and thats sooo early for me.
usaully i stay up until 5.
and i found out that my friend is joining the navy.

""people personalites are like stores,
some people say that i am like J.Crew,
because i am clean, modern, and classic,
but you also sometimes have to shop around, ya know?
because just like stores. their might be a person that you dont like.
and you wouldnt go in a store you didnt like right??
i wouldnt, but ya know thats just me.""

Shes a party animal let me tell you.
over-all summary- Blandine can buy us beer && Sam and i were some crazy-ass 8 year olds.


Today-
wentto the beach.
went to a ranodm picnic.
met this way cool chick.
formed an anti-social clique with Rosalie (way cool chick)
we jumped in the water with all our clothes on.
was talked about by the frenchies and preppy madison bitches.
jumped in the water again.
forze to death. and ate cake.

im not sure what she ment,  maybe the ice cream truck.
but we still went out to look for it.
i asked her random neighbor if they had seen it,
but im guessing they didnt, because they sort of ran inside.
then we went and saw 'The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants'
it really was a good movie.
except there was a huge skank in it.
who lost her virginity on the beach, and then the guy and her we like 'lets just be friends'
skank.

yesterday was interesting.
i was sitting around and being bored.
Gregg called me and i talked to him for like an hour.
and then we were going to go hang out at the random field.
but he left right when i got there.
so i was sitting there for like 15 minutes and all these random kids were watching me.
so as i was waiting Gregg walked all the way to my house, then back to his.
i finally left the stupid field and walked back to my house, but i remembered that i was locked out, so i just stood in the street for like 30 seconds.
than He called me and gave me wonderful directions to his house.
we played Ping Pong nad Fooseball (which i owned him at.) but i almost broke a light when i attempted to play ping-pong.
than we walked around and broke this random sign, so we switched it withthe neighbors.
now his street looks like a something huge knocked down the signs, but alas, it was only Greggie and I."

Graduation was awesome.
i thought about the past three years,
and how much ive changed, and how my friends have changed.
and about all the friends that dumped me, and used me.
well, over all it was awesome.
except for when Karissa turned aroundin the middle and asked me what time it is.
and when Briannas mom yelled at me.
Well, im sorry i hurt your daughters feelings, but she was using meeee.


After i went out to eat with my Grandma and my Mom and got super good food.
than i came home and sat around.
than PAUL came (aka most annoying kid everrr)
so my mom and i escaped to the mall.
i got 2 shirts, sunglasses, and a really awesome hoodie.

after i felt like walking so i was originally planned to walk to the beach,
but i walked to the Senior graduation instead.
and who did i see?
Chris Lombardozzi.
Hottest 18 year old to ever walk the face of the planet.
let me tell you, he looked good in purple?
it was fate.

but i just want someone so bad that ill make it work.
and i dont care what he did to me the first time we went out.
and i dont care if he did anything this last time.
everyone keeps telling me how it was stupid that i broke up with him.
and how much he loves me and all this other stuff. 
i feel really stupid.
i ruined it.
and i seriously cant sleep because of it.

i went in at 10ish and went in the cafeteria to watch the tape we made for Mrs.Russel.
i hate that Mr.House asked her to leave. she was a great teacher.
mr.h doesnt like her because if she doesnt agree with something he says she stands up and says something.
i hate him. he cant stand it when people stand up for themselves.
then i went to graduation rehersal. 
i didnt get any awards. i should have stayed home.
ms. ventresca was lie ""now you listen to the person that is on stage, thats me! blah blah""

so basically shes using my for my computer and my camera. not to mention im bringing her on vacation to lake george. which is expensive.
karissa only talks to me when katie isnt around, when she is all of sudden everything i do is wrong and stupid and shes so much cooler.


so thats basically all my friends.
im practically begging people to talk to me or invite me somewhere.

first i went on the french field trip to the Wadsworth Antheneum. 
i actually liked all the paintings and old clothes etc. 
but we didnt get enough time to look at everything.
we went and had a french picnic and listened to french music.
on  the ride back the teacher stopped and bought us ice cream, i felt so bad because i couldnt finish it..
we got back to school at the end of the day so i just hung out at Bri's locker.

Than we got ready and went to the dance.
i had so much fun because i was really hyper, but Bri was sad and wouldnt try to have any fun.
i mostly hung out with Missa. we took the coolest pictures, the hardcore way
for the first half we tried to find things to steal, because we werent having any fun and wanted it to be somehow productive.
there really wasnt anything to take, unless we were goign to take lightbulbs, so we just went and took everyones Mardi Gras beads.
we tried to find ways to get booze, but in the end we just kinda gave up.
we took hardcore pictures of teachers and Marcus...hehe.
We started a random group called the 'united rejected chicks' or something like that because noone was paying attention to us. we sat in the middle of the deck and glared at people until a song came on that we liked came on so Missa and i started dancing.
i actually danced, in a dorky way. Missa actually DANCED. wow. remember this night people , its never going to happen again.

i didnt know the days of the week, but i think i did okay.
i finished fast so i went and sat outside.
i was sitting on a wall waiting for my mom to come, 
i relized that a year from now everything could be the same as it is now
& that everything could be good and i would actually be happy and i would like school and crap.
i guess i had an epiphany? if thats how you spell it.
i suppose thats what a catholic school is for.

or we broke up with each other.
either way, we are not together anymore.
im sadder than i thought i would be, even though i was sad all day.
he left me voicemails on my phone saying that he NEEDED to talk to me.
so i knew it was coming.
Bry went to Martha's Vineyard with him, and he changes the subject whenever i bring it up.
so i dont know if he cheated on me, but im guessing he did.
this is just like last time.
ill find out in a week if he cheated on me.
just like before.


   school was hot.
it was insane.
especially last period.
the sub had Jon fan the class the whole period.
gym was fun.
i made julianna laugh.
and i scored a run (or whatever you call it) in whiffleball.
yes whiffleball. westbrook is to poor for baseball. or even softball.
i thought this 7th grader was going to beat me up.
shes insane,and i think shes on steriods.
when i was making awkward faces at her and she turned around and saw me. 
i swear that i saw a vein bluge in her forehead."

my dad took a day off and drove me to school.
school was okay, Karissa got in a huge fight..it was really immature.
it started over an ""as i lay dying"" pin.
Bri made the 'huge' mistake of buying it, she thought it was a saying.
karissa yelled at her and called her a poseur.
bri said something back... in the end,
karissa was going to beat Bri up after they got off the bus.
it was quite amusing to read the note.
but, what do ya know...their best friends again by the end of the day.


after school i went to walmart and bought a hair straightner and some random hair thinger.
Alan was supposed to come over...but his mom wouldnt let him.
she thinks hes this perfect christian, who doesnt do drugs or have sex, basically anything jesus wouldnt do.
she might let him come over after he tells her that im going to his school next year, and what a good chirstian i am.
we'll tell her that we are pray'sin jay-sus.
like good kids...
 im bummed now!!

i got home and Alan called me. i was disapponted because i thought he would cheer me up. but instead he told me that he thinks that we are going to break up soon. that he can ""predict it"" that makes sense...im not going to wait around for him all summer even if he doesnt move. and hes going on vacation all fucking summer. im going to bomb marthas vineyard.

ill do the whole weekend the cool way.
friday- i went over Sam's and we walked around and stalked Mr.Mulvihill...he were looking at his house and a car pulled in....we were crouching? in the woods for a while untill we relized it was an old, fat, lady. what would we have done if it was him? ""sorry we were just sitting in the woods by your house....we were trying to find deer"" haha. than she made my livejournal all cool. We watched this random movie  and Adrian Brody was so effing hott in it.
Saturday- i left Sam's house at 9ish and i went home and finished packing than we went to go get Bri and drove all the way to Boston...my mom gave me allergy medicine and i was so out of it...i was like ""are my eyes open...?"" and i laughed at everything people said..and than i just passed out.
we got to Boston and checked in, blah blah blah...than my mom took us on a tour and we went into Granley? cemetary. We were trying to get past a tour group and Brianna stepped on two graves, than she started choking so we booked it out of there. We went to random boring buildings...
It was Pride Day in Boston! I went and donated money to AIDS things and listened to Pro-Gay things and whatnot. there was no way that you couldnt know...there were signs and banners and flags and People kissing everywhere...there was a fucking protest about Gay Marriage..but in the center of all of it, after beng there for awhile, my mom is like ""OMGSHH, this is Gay Day!!"" that pissed me off...she kept making jokes...i was like ""its there day....dont ruin it"" i was really pissseeedddd.
Than, the hottest guy was doing a street performance with juggling and what not...not only was he 17...and British blonde, ripped and oober tan, but he had these pants on that would fall of when he would do tricks. i think he would remember us because we not only gave him like 20 dollars, but when he would ask the crowd to ""oh"" and ""ah"" Bri and i woudl have orgasams and do the wave. i was very impressed? than we went to the party and ended up walking aroudn with my dad. 
Sunday- we had breakfast and drove to NH..we went swimming in my cousins pool and hung out with cousins..."

so this weekend i was finally going to do so muchhhhhh. i was going to go to the movies with Bri...and help Alan ""babysit"". but i forgot that i had to go to Boston...to visit people.
i drew a really cool picture of this random depressed girl i saw working at Stop & Shop...her name was Astrid...and she looked sad so i drew her. and as a drew her i wondered what her life is like and why she could be sad. the picture kind of looks like ""nightmare before christmas"". ill scan it in if i feel like it..

she poured gasoline, and by fires light she cried

She would be like ""Jenny, dear? do you want some Advil?"" i didnt care what she called me as long as she gave me some fucking medicine, lol.
than i went home and slept for a couple hours. i went to my heart docter appontment and every thing was okay, so thats one thing i dont have to stress about now. i was making my mom laugh so hard at the docter she almost pissed herself. lol. i guess its good that we are getting along?
We went to TOVA's vintege shop! and we looked at all the rad prom dresses fomr the like 1930's. that store is really so awesome. except they have random 80's dresses that no one will buy. some of them are cool cuz their gold and poofy. 
than i went ot my grandmas house cuz my aunt and her friend were in town so they took me bowling and these metally-challenged 13 yr olds hit on us....haha

soo now im here just IMing Noah and i cant call Alan cuz his mom yelled at me because i guess he isnt home and i woke up his little brother. god thats not my fault. she kind of hung up on me so i couldnt ask for his cell cuz i forgot it. i dunno. i'll call my cousin to see if Alan's there or if he can give me his number. is that stalker-esque?"

She started telling us about how she goes to this Mythacal Journeys thing, its like Dungeons nad Dragons meets Pokeman meets Lord of the Rings except in real life. wow. she's really into it. she was like ""i commanded the gypsys to protect me from the dark lords because they were about to hit me with a death spell."" wow. i think its just unsafe to let a bunch of people like Miss F get together and run around at night with weapons. its just not safe. they might revolt, becasue their alter egos are magical elves. wow. i just relized she's my neighbor.

and i think im going to go out with Alan. He asked me out yesterday but he wouldnt let me answer, he told me to think about it for a day. thats actually a good idea because i' m a freak and if i didnt get a chance to really think about i would have broken up with him in a week, or if i said no in a week i would want to go out with him...god what a smart kid?

That you only see in the movies, you know what I mean""

I will suck the elixir from your fingertips
Until I feel my head start caving in
My mouth will overflow with your evil soul
And I'll be convulsing for days in this hole
Bubbling at the lips that you used to love to kiss
Well, I think I'm trying to wake up, but I can't\
-the spill canvas - ""your evil soul""


sooo today was pretty fun, i guess im friends with katie again, and honestly its a good thing/ at least now i have someone that will do stuff with me. maybe. we talked for the whole art period about stuff that we used to do. i was like ""hey remember that time we were laying on the side of the road and almost got hit?"" and than we told Bri about our genius plan. oh yes. hahaha. when i was going out with Danny and she was going out with Josh. We would randomly yell ""PONY"" when my parents were coming up the stairs and run into the sunroom and be like hey guyz whats up. lol. one couple on the couch and one in the sunroom. oh god, we are GENIUSES!


yea so i dont really know if we actually are friends agian or if she was being nice, and in the back of my mind im always thinking that shes going to go all bitchy and stab my in the back but oh well. if she does i won't have to ever see her again.

"event","Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That your're deserting for better company?
I can't accept that it's over...
I will block the door like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter of a tied-game rivalry

So just say how to make it right
And i swear i'll do my best to comply

Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together

I feel must interject here you're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember.
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear.
I've prepared a lecture on why i have to leave

So please back away and let me go
I can't my darling i love you so...

Tell me am i right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together
Don't you feed me lines about some idealistic future
Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures

I admit that i have made mistakes and i swear
I'll never wrong you again
You've got a lure i can't deny,
But you've had your chance so say goodbye
Say goodbye


yea i really love this song....you should too."

"event","wow
today was kind of a waste of time. 
Before School- i went in and waited for Bri and Karissa and they laughed at me when i said i was hurt. good friends.
Math- took a quiz and just spaced out.
Gym-watched people play soccer and read Bri's book for her. i was supposed to tell her what happened but i was too lazy. than she asked me about me talking about her, honestly i only remember talking about her once, and that was because i was annoyed and i didnt say bad things i only said that she kept me up late and that she was taking pictures of herself. but karissa said that i do it all the time..seriously kids...please stop doing that. 
History- took a quiz and went to the nurse. was lying down in her office for like an hour. she loves me the mostest. i sat in there threw break.
art- the art teacher is such a fucking crackhead.
english- i did a random assingment with people then i went ot the nurse again and then i went home.

soooo ive just been sitting arounnddddd.......blah. if my back doesnt hurt im sooo going to the beach tomorrow. i need friends. i cant wait untill i change schools.

blahhh. im happy and really sad at the smae time. i hope you had as much fun reading this as i did living it?"

so anyway heres my day
nothing really happened all day....today was pretty boring. In gym Bri made the mistake of giving me candyoh boy. so i was waaaayyyy hyper AND we were playing dodgeball, which is my favorite game ever because you can hit people and not get in trouble (the perfect game for me.) and i always go after the same person and i think they started to notice....oops. soo any way after i got out i sat behind everyone and put my hood up and started to act really werid i was like ""you get ze ball ya?"" and ""NO! you see, you must throw ze ball and i must hit ze person!!"" in all sorts of werid accents. than i just kinda took a nap during the game? so people threw balls at me and i rolled to the door. yea. it was werid. i think i went to sleep after.

than i fucking fell in the bathroom. i landed right on my back so im in SERIOUS pain...and AGONY!! i dont think i spelled it right


than the frecnh teacher wasnt in so karissa, bri, billy and i had a study hall like the old days..where we are in a room by ourselves. PURE mayhem let me tell you.im gonna miss those days....when no one was fighting and no one was moving....blah.


im really hyper. you have no idea. 



bye kids!!"

In every way
I can't stay awake
and I don't know why
I'm slipping away
and I don't know why

I'm trying to make it through each day
I'm falling apart now in every way
I'm finding it harder to get by
There's a hole in my heart
And I don't know why
Now I've come to realize

I'm slipping away-

"event","hi,
so i went to nyc on a stupid field trip yesterday and it really was not any fun. at all. i can only think of two times in the whole day that were fun, getting a tattoo and making up a story with Sam in a muesam. We went to things that everyone has seen before or knows everything about. 
i was mad at so many people for soooo many reasons. here we go, 
billy b/c he was being such an ass to me on the phone the other day so i called him a prick on the bus and was just a rageing bitch. i yelled at him b/c he was moving. haha. and than half way through the fucking thing he was randomly holding my hand and being the best person ever than two seconds later he would look at me like he didnt even know me, and stuff like that. grr. and i only fucking called him because he said he was sad. god. he yelled at me he said "" im was just in a bad mood blah, i have to do my homework."" yeah. hes probibly getting me back? or something form all the times that i confused him. but i needed him to put effort in than for various reasons. 

thaaannnnn Bri fucking wasted the battery on my camera on the bus taking pictures of herself, so right when we could see the statue of liberty my camera died. so now all i have are pictures of her and Cori.i told her not to take pictures. that really pisses me of but she used it anyway when i wasnt looking. which meant that she had to go in my bag to get it and i really hate it when people go through my stuff.




alrighty im done raging.haha when i got home my mom asked me is iwas drunk or stoned hahahaha. nice.


today i gardined and ate? oh yes good fun."

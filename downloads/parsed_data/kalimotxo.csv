"event","Flight moved to 1st Sept to 11th (not too keen on that return date; or is it actually the best?).  Ticket was about $350 cheaper (and I get not a penny of it), and I had to pay $200 to rebook, but nevermind.  These things are unavoidable sometimes!

Watch England win the effin' Cup now, and I could've watched from there.

Still will have that chat, just delayed a few months.  Probably better for me; if something comes of it, will put me closer to that lease expiration in February."

"event","I got my flight booked.  Got tired of waiting for the rates to drop and watching them only go the other way.  I'm not one to hold my nerve in that game of chicken...

Orbitz claimed to have a cheap KLM rate that would've been direct and let me earn miles.  However, whenever I selected it, the rate was said to be sold out, and that I should pick a new outbound flight.  Then it showed me a list of outbound flights.  That included only the one I had chosen.  Went on that roundabout for awhile, to no success.

In the end, CheapoAir got me a good deal with a stop in Iceland each way.  I was nervous to do this, I think for no reason other than remembering what happened to CB on her way home from visiting us in Brussels all those years ago.  Irrational, I know.

So, to London on the 25 June, back on the 10 July.  You know you're getting old when you book flights back with a day off to relax before working.  :)  Well, that and I didn't want to be in the air during the World Cup final.

Will spend time in London either up front, or at the weekend on the back end.  Plan to have a chat with a work contact there, good lad, who said his boss was willing to speak to me about opportunities while there.  Fingers crossed."

"event","I moved on Friday.  Not far away from where I was, but to a bigger place, that has a balcony.

They did some work behind the wall in a closet in the old place.  Apparently a flat two up had leaked water, and there was mould now.  It involved replacing some sheet rock.  I wasn't warned of the implications, and I am a bit naive at best about home improvement, but I was shocked at the sheen of white dust that was everywhere.  Literally, I cannot stress enough that it was in every far corner, behind every closed door.

So I began the unpleasant task of taking out all my possessions and wiping them down.  And I figured, this is the part I hate most about moving (packing), I've been here two years (since I was 18 I've never lived anywhere longer than two years, and one year is really closer to the average), might as well put things in a box rather than back once cleaned.  And that's what I did.

I've been sick for a week, and I'm sure the dust didn't help.  It refused to come out of the carpet, so I've probably been breathing it a little for weeks now."

Marika looked great in her dress.  There was a fantastic mix of reserved Swede, energetic English/Irish, and charasmatic Ghanian.  The entire event was held at the Law Society in London (I believe Joe's sister must be a member).  It's a great place to have a wedding; there's the Great hall for a gorgeous ceremony, a snappy modern bar for the champagne toast, and a very elegant dining room upstairs for dinner.<br /><br />The food was great and the champagne flowed for hours.  Many, many speeches were given, which left very little time for dancing before we were closed down at midnight.  The party moved back to Joe and Marika's hotel room, and ran until 4 in the morning.<br /><br />I was very happy to reconnect with people like Richard and Deb, the latter and I next to each other at dinner and having a great laugh the entire time.  Then met some new lovely people.  Joe's family friend Shelley was brilliant.  An accomplished horse trainer and fond of giving me motherly advice, she is one I will keep in contact with, for sure.<br /><br />Fantastic event all around.</p>"

I think I will be able to take some holiday around it again, though probably not two weeks again (I have the time, but I don't think another month away would go over well).

So, I'm trying to decide what to do.  Will probably head to Hong Kong, or maybe Taipei.  And if time permits, I'd like to go soak on the beach in Thailand."

"event","Tokyo is great, and the weather's been fantastic.  Was very warm when I went to the Meiji shrine (the best urban park I've seen, bar none), and to Harajuku/Shibuya.  And today, exploring Shinjuku was also very warm.

Still hazy to see the mountains, though.  I'm thinking of taking the train out there on Friday, but it's likely to rain, which means I might just spend the afternoon in a Harajuku manga cafe or something.  Tomorrow I'll go to central Tokyo to see the Imperial Palace.

Having a good time here.  Not pushing too hard on the touring, focusing more on looking at the architecture, the people, and the shops/cafes.  It's nice, and relaxing.  Not been exploring all the nightlife areas either; I've found a pub I like and gone there for a few at nights."

"event","I've arrived in Seoul, and am finally away from the Chinese censors, who for whatever reason fear LiveJournal but not FaceBook.

I'm having an early night tonight.  I had to get up at 6.45 this morning, and was planning a quiet dinner with colleagues to send me off from Shanghai and China.  How wrong was I.

My old boss ran into a Shanghai resident friend of his from Boston, while we were at dinner.  We went ""for a beer"", and then, after three bars, a strip club, and what can only be described as a brothel cum (please excuse the pun) disco, finally got home at 2.00 in the morning.  Tough getting up, packed and to the airport.  I'm knackered.

But it was well, well worth it.  Nothing sordid, no, other reasons.

---

I have no idea what I'm about here in Seoul.  I literally have no idea what there is to see here, though I'm sure there's plenty.  All I know about is Itaewan, which I could go to party at tomorrow night if I wish.  But I probably won't.  After what I've heard about it, and after already seeing a club full of scantily clad, semi-attractive women in their dozens in Shanghai, I don't know if I really need to squeeze onto another dance floor and hear the barstaff yelling to 55 year old American dirty bastards that ""you can molest her, no problem, it's free"".  Ugh."

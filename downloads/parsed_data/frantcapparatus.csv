"event","Yay, school started. I was rather upset on the last day of summer. One, I couldn't do anything with anyone because my dad wanted me to stay home. Why, you ask? HE HAD TO PUT TOGETHER A FUCKING BEDFRAME. Gr.

I babysat tonight. There's this girl I've been babysitting named Rebecca, and I HATE kids, but she's pretty cool. Cutest lil' girl I ever did see. And I get money. :D

My schedule is *insert smart word here*:

Art II
Spanish II
Integrated Math III
Lunch (Yummay. A lunch by the way.)
US History
English III Enriched
Chemistry

Yay. I have friends in my classes, but not near as many as I'd like. A lot are at lunch though, and that means a lot. :)

I haven't seen Duston in forever, I miss hiiiiiiim! >:( My penis daddy had to keep me away from my mayyan and his hot lovin'. Damn."

Big surprise eh? :D

Sorry I haven't updated in...forever. I guess I got lazy and felt like never writing in my LiveJournal again. But...I guess I feel different at the moment.

I just got back from Virginia yesterday. I went to see my cousins and stuff like that, King's Dominion, blah blah blah. I didn't have fun though, I missed Duston. :(

I'm extremely tired at the moment, I need more sleep. I hate this time of the month. :("

You hate people. You think they should all die. You're right.

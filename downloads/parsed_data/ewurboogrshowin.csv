"event","MAN! I dont feel so great. On Saturday I was feeling dizzy but sucked it up becuase it was my little cousins 7th birthday. So during the party my head as throbbing while my eyes were burning, so most of the time i was just laying on Ate Yvonys bed. What made it worse was that my oh so wonderful cousin was singing ALL NIGHT! OVER and OVER and OVER again! I think that was one of the reasons why i felt really sick when i got home. HAHA! Yesterday i was  made the decision to go to a car show, but didnt end up going because i felt REALLY sick! Then around 1pm my mom was asking if i wanted to go to the theatres with them but then again I DIDNT FEEL GOOD! so i jsut stayed home the WHOLE DAY SUNDAY! TODAY! I feel better than yesterday, Im hoping id feel really better tomorrow because me and my friends have plans, and the rest of the week i have to look for a gift and a dress for my     friends debut.Hopefully im extremenly better by Saturday. Well imma go rest my eyes now!"

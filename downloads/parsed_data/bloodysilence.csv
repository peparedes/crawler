"event","as some of you know, i've recently been having some trouble with a man i was seeing for a very short time, here in the steel city.
to be completely honest, it's gone from a level of being annoyed, to a level of being freaked out.  it's not to the level of straight-up scared yet, but it's unnerving nonetheless.  i've never really been in a situation like this before.  it's bizarre.
school is frustrating.  it's frustrating to know that i'm paying over thirty thousand dollars to learn things from other students, because some of my teachers aren't qualified to teach me what i'm supposed to be learning.  i've been taking my syllabus and marking down the things i need to learn, then finding other students in higher semesters and getting them to teach me.
it's not all bad up here though.  i've met some really nice people in the last week that i'm surprised i haven't met before.
none of this stuff matters right now though, because tomorrow afternoon, wes and lilu dallas are coming here to stay for the day/night, and i couldn't be happier.  it's been weeks.
i had so much more to say, and now i can't remember a lick of it."

and it's true what they say,
everything really is bigger in texas.
i'll put up the pictures from the dallas zoo and other stuff tomorrow.  i'm at work and i'm so exhausted, because it wasn't too terribly long ago that we were getting off the plane at bwi.
i want to go to the beach SO badly, but no one will go with me, and i don't have reliable wheels.  the beginning of fall is the perfect time of year for the beach.
a certain dude wants to advertize on his website for the comic haleigh and i are working on.  more on that later.
i got like lined up 3 modelling jobs last week that are fast approaching.  two of them are paid.  this is very sweet, because i am definitely hurting for cash.  we go for round 2 of apartment hunting in pittsburg at the end of this month.  
i feel like i've been in texas for a month.  it's weird.  it's only been a week.  i feel like i haven't seen anyone in forever.

midterms can go to hell!"

"event","hey there buddies.  halloween was bangin', minus carroll county's RIDICULOUS 8pm trick or treating curfew.  i'll spare you my rant though.  i haven't really said much on here lately.  there's lots to say, but i guess i don't really know where to begin.  i just can't wait to go to school in february and make zombies.
alright, here's some halloween night and weekend pictures....

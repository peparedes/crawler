<i><P>My summer is now officially over.</P>
<P>This has been one of the best ones I've had in such a long time.&nbsp; I've enjoyed every minute of it.</P>
<P>SAC Exec Retreat...wow.</P>
<P>The last two days have been UNBELIEVABLE.&nbsp; I have seriously learned so much about myself....my strengths, my weaknesses, and just basically an overall outlook on who I am.&nbsp; I am in love with our SAC Exec.&nbsp; It's going to be a great year...I can see it already.</P>
<P>I think my big ""Ah-ha"" moment was during the trust fall.&nbsp; Just closing my eyes and falling backwards (from a platform that's about as tall as me) into the people I now trust...(at that moment with my life)...was such an overwhelming feeling.&nbsp; The moment I was caught and I opened my eyes and saw all of my friends around me....wow.&nbsp; That was amazing.</P>
<P>I scaled the majority of the hard part of the rock wall...and had a blast going down the zip line.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There's so much that went on that I don't even know if I can write it all out.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Basically the best way to sum it up is:&nbsp; Wow</P>

"event","yesh...the rumor is true...I finally bought myself a swimming suit. A bikini, in fact! Crazy. I've never really had the right body type to wear one o' those tiny things...but hey, this was cute...and cheap. Wal-mart...I love your low prices. I blame my car for the purchase though. It took so freakin long for it to get its oil changed, I was forced to shop...hence the purchase.

I really don't know why I bought it though...I don't swim...or tan. Hah! Maybe one day...we'll see. I'll bust it out someday.

Hmm...What else...what else...

Tomorrow/today is the first exec meeting. woot! Jacob has asked me to ask the other chairs about our trip next Tuesday...since I'm one of the few that are going. Wow...first meeting and I'm gonna be speakin part o' the time. Scary times two, yo.

Interjecting a girly moment: I think I'm gonna wear a skirt tommorrow....a skirt and my cute keyboard shirt. Yesh..sounds good. I'm starting to like skirts...even though my legs are ugly! They need sun....they are freakisly WHITE...so yeah. 


Hummm...what's stressin me currently?......straightening out this crazy job/internship situation.

So here's the dilemma...should I go with the bank position or wait out for the internship? The bank offered me the job. I kinda don't want it. But it's a guaranteed job. Bank? Internship o' my dreams? I'm scared that right when I accept the bank position...then with my luck....I'll land the internship I really want and then be stuck in a crappy situation. Or there's also the other choice where I refuse the bank...then again with my crazy, luck I'll get no responses from the internships. Ach. Risk it? Go the safe way? What to do?

Bank: $8 an hours, somewhat flexible hours, all women employees, older clientele, I'd be working all positions (teller, account opener, receptionist, greeter, etc), kinda cruddy workin' environment, strict dress code, strict supervisor..I met her.

Internship o' my dreams: $9 an hours, flexible hours, ongoing...basically I'd work there until I'm fired/quit, counts for college credit, will actually be doing accounting work, major corporation experience

ACH...the timing! I don't know what to do...

Then there's Megan who stated that she'd give in a good word for me at the place she's workin at. She's going to be leaving in July and they'll be needing a replacement. Actual Accounting work, $10 an hour, very flexible hours, on-going postion. 

Geez.

I just dunno what to do.




I hate making decisions."

How Sexy Is Your Name? 
According to studies, the first letter of your first name reveals 
your sexual identity ... What do you think? 
-A- 
You are not particularly romantic, but you are interested in action. 
You mean business. With you, what you see is what you get. You have 
no patience for flirting and can't be bothered with someone who is 
trying to be coy, cute, demure, and subtly enticing. You are an up front 
person. When it comes to sex, it's action that counts not obscure 
hints. Your mate's physical attractiveness is important to you. You 
find the chase and challenge of the ""hunt"" invigorating. You are 
passionate and sexual as well as being much more adventurous than 
you appear; however, you do not go around advertising these 
qualities. Your physical needs are your primary concern. 
-B- 
You give off vibes of lazy sensuality. You enjoy being romanced, 
wined, and dined. You are very happy to receive gifts as an 
expression of the affection of your lover. You want to be pampered 
and know how to pamper your mate. You are private in your expression 
of endearments and particularly when it comes to lovemaking. You 
will hold off until everything meets with your approval. You can 
control your appetite and abstain from sex if need be. You require 
new sensations and experiences. 
You are willing to experiment. 
-C- 
You are a very social individual, and it is important to you to have 
a relationship. You require closeness and togetherness. You must be 
able to talk to your sex partner before, during, and after. You want 
the object of your affection to be socially acceptable and good 
looking. You see your lover as a friend and companion. You are very 
sexual and sensual, needing someone to appreciate and almost worship 
you. When this cannot be achieved, you have the ability to go for long 
periods 
without sexual activity. You are an expert at controlling your 
desires and doing without. 
-D- 
Once you get it into your head that you want someone, you move full 
steam ahead in pursuit. You do not give up your quest easily. You 
are nurturing and caring. If someone has a problem, this turns you 
on. You are highly sexual, passionate, loyal, and intense in your 
involvement, sometimes possessive and jealous. Sex to you is a 
pleasure to be enjoyed. You are stimulated by the eccentric and 
unusual, having a free and open. 
-E- 
Your greatest need is to talk. If your date is not a good listener, 
you have trouble relating. A person must be intellectually 
stimulating or you are not interested sexually. You need a friend 
for a lover and a companion for a bedmate. You hate disharmony and 
disruption, but you do enjoy a good argument once in a while it 
seems to stir things up. You flirt a lot, for the challenge is more 
important than the sexual act for you, but once you give your heart 
away, you are uncompromisingly loyal. When you don't have a good 
lover to fall asleep with, you will fall asleep with a good book. 
(Sometimes, in fact, you prefer a good book.) 
-F- 
You are idealistic and romantic, putting your lover on a pedestal. 
You look for the very best mate you can find. You are a flirt, yet 
once committed, you are very loyal. You are sensuous, sexual, and 
privately passionate. Publicly, you can be showy, extravagant, and gallant. 
You are born romantic. Dramatic love scenes are your favorite 
fantasy pastime. You can be a very generous lover. 
-G- 
You are crap in bed! ( Remember....I didn't write this!!!! ) 
-H- 
You seek a mate who can enhance your reputation and earning ability. 
You will be very generous to your lover once you have attained a 
commitment. Your gifts are actually an investment in your partner. 
Before the commitment, though, you tend to be frugal in your 
spending and dating habits and equally cautious in your sexual 
involvement. You are a sensual and patient lover. 
-I- 
You have a great need to be loved, appreciated...Even worshipped. 
You enjoy luxury, sensuality, and pleasures of the flesh. You look 
for lovers who know what they are doing. You are not interested in 
an amateur, unless that amateur wants a tutor. You are fussy and 
exacting about having your desires satisfied. You are willing to 
experiment and try new modes of sexual expression. You bore easily 
and thus require sexual adventure and change. You are more sensual 
than sexual, but you are sometimes downright lustful. 
-J- 
You are totally fucking marvelous! 
-K- 
You can be very romantic, attached to the glamour of love. 
Having a partner is of paramount importance to you. You are free in 
your expression of love and are willing to take chances, try new 
sexual experiences and partners, provided it's all in good taste. 
Brains turn you on. You must feel that your partner is 
intellectually stimulating, otherwise you will find it difficult to 
sustain the relationship. You require loving, cuddling, wining, and 
dining to know that you're being appreciated. 
-L- 
You are very romantic, idealistic, and somehow you believe that to 
love means to suffer. You wind up serving your mate or attracting 
people who have unusual troubles. You see yourself as your lover's 
savior. You are sincere, passionate, lustful, and dreamy. You can't 
help falling in love. You really enjoy stimulating yourself, though 
you are fairly new to it. You fantasize and get turned on by movies 
and magazines. You do not tell others of this secret life, nor of 
your sexual fantasies. 
-M- 
You are emotional and intense. When involved in a relationship, you 
throw your entire being into it. Nothing stops you; there are no 
holds barred. You are all consuming and crave someone who is equally 
passionate and intense. You are willing to try anything and 
everything. Your supply of sexual energy is inexhaustible. You are 
very social and sensual; you enjoy flirting and also enjoy mothering 
your mate. 
-N- 
You need constant stimulation because you bore quickly. You can 
handle more than one relationship at a time with ease. You believe 
in total sexual freedom. You are willing to try anything and 
everything. Your supply of sexual energy is inexhaustible. You are a 
flirt, yet once committed, you are very loyal. You are sensuous, 
sexual, and privately passionate. Publicly, you can be showy, 
extravagant, and gallant. You are born romantic. Dramatic love 
scenes are your favorite fantasy pastime. You can be a very generous 
lover. 
-O- 
You are very interested in sexual activities yet secretive and 
energy into making money and/or seeking power. You can easily have 
extended periods of celibacy. You are a passionate, compassionate, 
sexual lover, requiring the same qualities from your mate. Sex is 
serious business; thus you demand intensity and diversity, and are 
willing to try anything or anyone. Sometimes your passions turn to 
possessiveness, which must be kept in check. 
-P- 
You are very conscious of social proprieties. You wouldn't think of 
doing anything that might harm your image or reputation. Appearances 
count, therefore, you require a good-looking partner. You also 
require an intelligent partner. Oddly enough, you may view your 
partner as your enemy; A good fight stimulates those sex vibes. You 
are relatively free of sexual hang-ups. You are willing to 
experiment and try new ways of doing things. You are very social and 
sensual; you enjoy flirting and need a good deal of physical 
gratification. 
-Q- 
You require constant activity and stimulation. You have tremendous 
physical energy. It is not easy for a partner to keep up with you, 
sexually or otherwise. You are an enthusiastic lover and tend to be 
attracted to people of other ethnic groups. You need romance, hearts 
and flowers, and lots of conversation to turn you on and keep you 
going. 
-R- 
You are a no-nonsense, action-oriented individual. You need someone 
who can keep pace with you and who is your intellectual equal the 
smarter the better. You are turned on more quickly by a great mind 
than by a great body. However, physical attractiveness is very 
important to you. You have to be proud of your partner. You are 
privately very sexy, but you do not brag, you are willing to serve 
as teacher. Sex is important; you can be a very demanding playmate. 
-S- 
You are secretive, self-contained, and shy. You are very sexy, 
sensual, and passionate, but you do not let on to this. Only in 
intimate privacy will this part of your nature reveal itself. When 
it gets down to the nitty-gritty, you are an expert. You know all 
the little tricks of the trade, can play any role or any game, and 
take your love life very seriously. You don't fool around. You have 
the patience to wait for the right person to come along. 
-T- 
You are very sensitive, private, and sexually passive; you like a 
partner who takes the lead. Music, soft lights and romantic thoughts 
turn you on. You fantasize, but do not tend to fall in and out of 
love easily. When in love, you are romantic, idealistic, mushy, and 
extremely intense. You enjoy having your senses and your feelings 
stimulated, titillated, and teased. You are a great flirt. You can 
make your relationships fit your dreams, oftentimes all in your own 
head. 
-U- 
You are enthusiastic and idealistic when in love. When not in love, 
you are in love with love, always looking for someone to adore. You 
see romance as a challenge. You are a roamer and need adventure, 
excitement, and freedom. You deal in potential relationships. You 
enjoy giving gifts and enjoy seeing your mate looking good. Your sex 
drive is strong and you desire instant ratification. You are willing 
to put your partner's pleasures above your own. 
-V- 
You are individualistic, and you need freedom, space, and 
excitement. You wait until you know someone well before committing 
yourself. Knowing someone means psyching him out. You feel a need to 
get into his head to see what makes him tick. You are attracted to 
eccentric types. Often there is an age difference between you and 
your lover. You respond to danger, thrills, and suspense. The gay 
scene turns you on, even though you yourself may not be a 
participant. 
-W- 
You are very proud, determined, and you refuse to take no for an 
answer when pursuing love. Your ego is at stake. You are romantic, 
idealistic,and often in love with love itself, not seeing your 
partner as he or she really is. You feel deeply and throw all of 
yourself into your relationships. Nothing is too good for your 
lover. You enjoy playing love games. 
- X- 
You need constant stimulation because you bore quickly. You can 
handle more than one relationship at a time with ease. You can't 
shut off your mind. You talk while you make love. You can have the 
greatest love affairs, all by yourself, in your own head. 
-Y- 
You are sexual, sensual, and very independent. If you can't have it 
your way, you will forgot the whole thing. You want to control your 
relationships, which doesn't always work out too well. You respond 
to physical stimulation, enjoy necking and spending hours just 
touching, feeling and exploring. However, if you can spend your time 
making money, you will give up the pleasures of the flesh for the 
moment. You need to prove to yourself and your partner what a great 
lover you are. You want feedback on your performance. You are an 
open, stimulating, romantic.</lj-cut>"

<P>Yesterday was the Riverfest trip with the SAC crew.&nbsp; I must say...we all looked quite spiffy in our matching shirts.&nbsp; The parade was fun to watch.&nbsp; Although this may sound weird to most people...but this actually my first Riverfest...at least my first that I can remember.&nbsp; I've been to many Hutchfests...and well..Riverfest just beats it by a lil bit.&nbsp; After Jerry, Yetunde, Sarah, and Erin left, Megan, Dustin and I ventured downtown.&nbsp; That was interesting.&nbsp; We eventually found Jacob.&nbsp; He and I went off and found some food and had a nice chat.&nbsp; Jacob cool.&nbsp; Later we met up with David and Hollie and watched the fireworks.&nbsp; It was fun-ish.&nbsp; Except for the fact that Jacob and I felt like the fifth and sixth wheel in the situation.&nbsp; Gah.&nbsp; Couples.&nbsp; I hate them.&nbsp; Megan &amp; Dustin.&nbsp; Hollie and David.&nbsp; Uh...uncomfortable.&nbsp; Anywho...the night was nice and I had fun.</P>
<P>Today was the SAC Banquet.&nbsp; I got to dress all purdy and stuff.&nbsp; It was nice seeing everyone else dressed up too.&nbsp; We all looked spiffy.&nbsp; The speeches got to me.&nbsp; I teared up a couple of times.&nbsp; Chuck&nbsp;won the Volunteer of the Year Award.&nbsp; I was so happy for him.&nbsp; At the end they had the new 2005-2006 executive board come up to the front.&nbsp; I kinda had to run up...darn heels...but it was fun standing up there with my fellow exec-ers.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But Gah....with my luck of the night...my camera batteries died.&nbsp; Unfortunately I got no pictures from the actual banquet.<IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/sad.gif"" width=15>&nbsp; </P>
<P>But...Chuck saved the day and gave me some batteries.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Mike's Afterparty!</P>
<P>That was fun.&nbsp; It was nice mingling.&nbsp; Mike has such an AMAZING house.&nbsp; He's definitely decorating mine when I get one.&nbsp; Jen and Carissa are two of the funniest girls I've met.&nbsp; I loved laughing up the evening with them.&nbsp; Jerry played some beautiful guitar.&nbsp; My future committee members, Chuck &amp; Andy were quite the entertaining pair.&nbsp; It was just a perfect night.&nbsp; <IMG height=15 src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/happy.gif"" width=15></P>

:P

Yesterday was the most emotionally up and down day ever....also the busiest.   Should I break it down for ya?...yes, yes I should. 

So it all began normally.  

9:30-10:20........English  (That class it he most pointless class ever.  I learned/mastered everything we're doing right now in Ms. Groves class last year.  meh.  Easy ""A"".)  

Next....Psychology from 10:30-11:20.  Woot.  (Yet another pointless class.  I own it.  Seriously.  I think I have 110% or something. I rock.) We did personality tests and what-not...so I really could've skipped if I wanted to, but I didn't...b/c that would be wrong.

Once 11:30 hit, it was time for the promotional skits for Swing into Spring.  I ran, through on my red shirt and promoted away.  Woot.  That went until 1:00.  

Next.  I had to meet with the Live Entertainment committee.  Well, technically I was just intruding on their meeting...but it was for a good purpose.  Chuck and I went.  We were early.  Emily and Andy eventually got there and we presented our Swing into Spring Shpeel.  

1:45-ish....Emily wanted me to run some office errands.  I did it because I'm her lil' bitch.   Hah!  

2:00.....Work.  Fun ol' work.

4:00....Break from work.  Ran over to RSC for my Vice President Interview.  Nervous as all hell.  Big table of 15-ish people starin ya down.  Aaaah.  But I felt okay with it afterwards. 

4:30....back to work.

7:00....Closed the library and then ran to RSC to set up the dance.  Swing into Spring!  SHYEAH!

8:00-9:00....went along with the swing dance instruction and boogied down.  I had a good dance partner.

9:00-10:00....manned the Admission table.

10:00-11:00....manned the Food/Drink table.  (actually it was more like block other people from the food so I could eat it...but same thing.)

11:00-midnight....Dance clean-up.  That was fun.

Midnight-1:30am....IHop w/ the arts and Live entertainment crew.  (I saw Andy!!!)

 

In conclusion....I think I overscheduled yesterday...majorly.  But it was a blast.  Swing into Spring went awesome-ly. We had a great turnout and I had a blast swing dancing.  Jerry and I had it down.  Later and old man asked me to dance....and that was interesting.  He was really touchy-feely....but an awesome dancer.  

In the middle of the dance, Shan (SAC president) pulled me out to inform me whether I got the VP position or not.  I didn't.  I almost cried....almost....but I got lots of hugs from Emily, Jerry, and Ann.  Bestest WSU buds.    Oh well, I got chair interviews coming up in two weeks.   I better get that position...or I'll really cry.  I'm pushing Jaime to run too....(we both wanted VP....didn't get it)  He better get Family chair...and I better get Arts Chair.  We better.  Or else.  Anywho...we gots connections.  Emily's the new Pres!!!

So all-in-all yesterday was a blast.  It was hectic but awesome.  I was stupid and didn't take my camera to Swing into Spring...but maybe I'll mooch some pics off Emily.

 

Today's Schedule?...hah!...like you were asking.

10:00-3:00.....Family Carnival.  I'm so gonna party with the kids.

7:00-11:00-ish.....Jane's (my supervisor) party.

7:00-11:00-ish.......Emily's birthday party.    

I'm supposed to go to both parties...so we'll se how that works out..."

So...Spring Break.  It came and went.

Prior plans of treking to Chicago were foiled due to the fact that I work for minimum wage at the library and had bills to pay.  Jerry too.  We planned on heading to Kansas City over this last weekend, but again, work and lack o' money interrupted.  So all-in-all, any fun planned for spring break was ruined by the Ablah Library.  I hate you Ablah Library.......<small>okay not really...but we're not on speaking terms right now....</small>

So the whole week mainly consisted of work and studying.  I even came into the library on days I didn't work...that's how bored I was.  I got a lot of homework done though.  woot.  I even read ahead in all my classes. But thinking about it now...I think I'll probably end up really lazy in all my classes from this point on due to my incredible productive-ness over spring break.  Meh.  

On my time not studying or working...it was spent with my bud.  We even watched a movie with my cousins.  That was fun.  The movie sucked...but the experience of going in a group was nice.  I haven't done that in such a long time.  Usually I watch movies with Al, but she wasn't there.  So cousins and Jerry sufficed.  I even went to a pancake feed.  That was okay-ish.  The featured entertainment was belly dancing.  Belly Dancing at a pancake feed.  Interesting.  There certainly was a lot of belly moving....I couldn't stomach more than one pancake due to that...but it was for a good cause...so it's okay..I guess.

Hmm..

I just turned in my application to the SAC office.  I'm currently running for two positions, VP of Membership and Chair of Arts Committee.  We'll see which one I get.  I hope VP....it's an easier job.

Today's weather is unbelievably wonderful.  I have the urge to go outside and read, lay in the grass and read.  It would even be nice just to lay on the sidewalk like I did that one day.  But people would probably walk on me.  

Uhhh..

I need a haircut.  I'm considering doing something dramatic...but at the same time...I'm scared of doing something dramatic.  I'm such a wuss.  My idea is to cut the back part of my hair really REALLY short and keep the front long.  Basically a reverse mullet.  I want do dye my hair red and blonde and black. Three colors.  But...it could end up disasterous.  We'll see what I end up doing.

Okay..


That's it for now.  

Yay it's monday!"

<i>Although sexual abuse is very prevalent in the lives of millions of children, many times the subject is rarely acknowledged much less understood. In this book, Julie Posey speaks openly about the profoundly destructive effects that the secrecy has on innocent victims.

Using actual chat logs with later convicted sexual predators, the author uncovers the secrets of what it is like to be a pedophile, child molester or child pornographer preying on children. Readers share the same experience that Julie Posey, a highly successful Cyber Crime Fighter has had in each of over 60 cases involving child molesters on the Internet.

Also included in the book are interviews with confessed and self-proclaimed pedophiles and child molesters. It may shock you to see some of the bizarre ways that these offenders justify their behaviors and form huge networks among like minded persons.

Eventful morning.  I spent last night/this morning typing up my Engl102 paper.  Procrastination.  I love it.  If anyone is wondering or possibly cares, the paper was over which diet is better: Atkins or South Beach. It was concluded at four this morning, so I think I ended up choosing South Beach...or something.  I dunno.  The paper's done, that's all that matters.

*sigh*

This week is going to be crazy hectic.  Tomorrow I'm a proud volunteer at the Jean Kilbourne lecture going on here at WSU.  4:30-9:00.  Sweetness.  Thursday I'll be serving at the Bob Blackwell reception and ushering at the keynote speech following it.  5:15-9:00. Woot.  Saturday is the Plant-a-Picture Extraveganza put on by SAC. 9:00-1:00.  Rock on.

I love the fact that I now use this journal as a reminder of what I need to do for the week.  Useful, yes.


My parents have concluded that I hate them.  geez.  They don't like me flirting with the idea of moving out in a year or so or working somewhere other than the jewelry store.  Sorry.  I'm not going to live with Loan forever, and I'm DEFINITELY not going to work at the store for the rest of my life.  I need out of Kansas.  Plans: Get apartment.  Get new job that pays more.  Finish degree.  Be an accountant to the stars.  Hah!  Not.




Okay.  

I think that's enough for now.

"event","I'm exhausted.  Being on campus for hmmm...9:30 to.....well, over thirteen hours, is just too much.  Class, work, and whatever else I was doing got me a-tired.

This weekend comprised of myself being the wonderful driver for various family members.  Hutch, back, Hutch, back, Hutch, and back again.  

Devon is the sweetest baby ever.

My great aunt died.


I don't know if I've ever gone so emotionally up and down so many times in a two day span.....ever.  It's tiring on your eyes.

Saturday I went to the SAC retreat with Jerry.  It was fun.  I hula-ed in front of a crowd of thirty-ish people and enjoyed every moment.  You know you accomplished some ""breaking out of your shell""-ness when you feel comfortable doing something like that.  I love SAC.  They're asking me to run for executive position.  Maybe.


Jerry and I went and watched a play on Friday.  ""Boy Gets Girl.""  It was really good.  Scared the crap out of me though.  It was about stalkers.  The dude who was the stalker...very convincing.


Today CNN called the WSU library and had us send some documents immediately for them to air on the show that was put on tonight about BTK.  Go WSU Library!

I'm rambling.

Awww...Devon just makes me smile."

"event","Wasting two hours is so hard to do.  I normally have someone to hang out with...but today's his first day of work.  Work at the library.  So I gotta waste time on my own now.  What's a girl to do.  Ah yes.  Poster for an hour and a half...then bid on stupid crap on ebay.

Postering for the Arts' and Craft Sale is no fun.  Especially when you're doin it by yourself.  You can tell which ones I postered around campus...they're about chest height for all you freakishly tall people.  I stood on my tippy toes taping those freaking things on every building possible....but I bet most may not even see them...since they still are quite low.  Oh wells.  I'll rally up a bunch o' people to help keep our vendors satisfied.  I was so relieved that we have at least four people that submitted the paperwork and are selling at the sale.  If not...I would be a complete failure at this event head position that I'm in.  *sigh*

Saturday is the SAC retreat.  Yep.  That's not really to inform anyone of anything really, just a reminder for myself.

Fifteen minutes to kill....GAH."

"event","Wow, so after a week and a half of playing like mad crazy, moving in, and having the first week of classes... well its been quite crazy.  

It was cool having my car during band camp.  I've really gotten to know the whole Atl area quite well.  Also since I got to drive around to the home area a bunch in search of djun djuns, and that was pretty fun.  For anyone who hasn't heard yet, we're playing the BD 99 show at Tech... which we all know is a kick ass show.  Its also great because it means I actually get to play hard stuff again.  When I went back to Quest last year, my hands were quite out of shape, but band camp even gave me all kinds of blisters on me hands.  I'm definately gonna be back up to speed for AQ.  *grins*

Moving in worked out really well.  We bought a carpet.  Its so pretty, and soft... Everyone come touch my carpet!!  Right now!!!!  Seriously, I've had people come up to my room just so they can walk on my carpet.  Come visit me!!

So after that great first week, classes started.  My mwf's are insane... 10-6 with a one hour break at 11.  I'd go get lunch then, but my 10 and 12 oclock classes are in the same building, so I pretty much just grab a snack... TR's are easy though *grin*  Monday after band, we definately went to the pool in the CRC... The waterslide is awesome!!  Seriously, whoulda thought it was gonna be like that?!?!  Definately went back again on Wednesday and today... 

Late late wednesday night... like 1 15 am... stopper in the toilet broke and we had some floodage... it was quite frustrating... my poor carpet was injureded... but it got steam cleaned and is all nice again *yay*

Highlight of everything though was the weekend.  Thursday late afternoonish Courtney came and spent the night with me.  We had so much fun!  Her, Sharma, Blake and I went to Felini's for dinner, and then to Sharmas room for a couple hours of Family Guy :o)  (course most of you already know all this... but ha! you get to read it again).  Then Courtney and I stayed up really late talking as usual.  Friday she was gonna drop me off at my house so I could get my car and get back in time for diff eqs... however I couldn't get into the house.  So Courtney and I had lunch at Arby's while my daddy drove home from work to the rescue... Ended up only getting back intime for politics... oh well.  Ooo!  My politics professor reminds me of Fezzini.  I'm just waiting for him to shout 'Inconceivable!""  :op .

So after band, Blake and I met up with Courtney and her then 'date' Steve at Olive Garden for dinner.  yum!  Steve is great!  He and I were definately talking a bunch, and theres nothing more awkward than not knowing what to say to one of your best friend's guys.  So then we all went to the NC-Kell game.  It was fun seeing everyone.  During Kell's halftime show I saw Chris (Rach's bro) and was very amused.  Started raining half way through NC.  So after running out of the rain and catching up with a bunch of people, Courtney, Blake, Steve and I went to C^2's house.  Holy Crap!!  It was sooo much fun.  Lots and lots of foosball, some rumikubness, and of course spades... followed by more foosball.  We were all in tears laughing quite often.  Not only do I get along with Steve, but Blake and Steve were getting along well too.  It was great.  The four of us will definately have to hang out more often.  Courtney's guy definately got my stamp of approval.  (though he's the luckier one of course ;o) )

Saturday was mine and Blake's anniversary.  He loved his shirt *grin*.  We had a lot of fun even though we ended up not really going anywhere.  We couldn't really come up with anything to go do.  So we pretty much stayed in and watched olympics.  (which have been awesome by the way)

Ok, now that I've insanely bored you all with my really long post about the past 2 1/2 weeks of my life... I will leave.  Sorry... kinda what happens when you haven't posted in a while *doh*"

Thats right, short and intimidating :o)  ... If I say I root for evil, Kira is both my second in command *and* my arch nemisis... I wonder that that works...

First day of practiceness.  I completely screwed up in my audition, but auditioning is lame anyway.  They want as many people in pit as they can get, and they know I can play so...yeah...

Picking up the jeff lee score tomorrow to take to Chris... wahhoo.  its good hanging out with Hannah again...  some of the freshman are pretty cool... Liz is in pit which its cool, cuz I've talked to her more today than I talked to her all last season.  We won't have 9 bases, only 6.  We're playing at the exhibition at mceachern!!  So all of you who want to see our show will actually get a chance to see it :o)  i was very excited to find that out.  

yay for BD 99 :o) ... Chris said I can have the clave part ;o)

well time for 12 hours of practice tomorrow *doh*"

So, overall, good weekend.  Village on Thursday night with the Quest folk... awesome.  Friday, didn't really do much during the day, but then left with my parents for Murfreesboro!!  Woooohoooo!!!  Yay for drum corps.  BD won, Cavies got second.  I think I liked BD better when they did their encore though.  

Saturday, left for Chattanooga to meet up with my grandma, my aunt, and my two adorable cousins.  My parents weren't sure where to go, and I helped them find their way cuz I completely get chattanooga after going there with C^2.  We were gonna see an IMAX movie but they were all sold out, so instead we went swimming.  Only not me cuz I didn't pack my swimsuit (i figured we were just gonna have lunch with them) but I still sat on the side of the pool and had fun... got painted blue by Margaret.  hehe... 

Had fun, but I was still sad to miss the NC show.  Oh well

Sunday, went to Sharma's party wheeee!  Then went to Ashley's party, but unfortunately couldn't stay too long.  But still had lots of fun.

Saw Jessica today!!  Talked to her for like, an hour... which was good.  I miss her so much.  Its weird not seeing her every week :o(  Went shopping... went into Buckle... I swear everyone in there is so nice... I always end up having long convos with people.  That was really the only store I went in.

Anyway, that was my fun.  I also made a killing at poker earlier and made $44 dollars in 4 hours... :o)"

Hung out with Rachie today... pretty much involved lots of talking, and watching Night at the Roxbury since I haven't seen since... well since it came out on video and I rented it.  (1998 in case you were wondering ;op)  I forgot how great that movie is... and Bear played the bouncer!!  Thats awesome!"

Started off with finishing the first season of the show I've been watching (... 0:o) )

Went swimming with Laurie... which was fun even though the water was 74 degrees and we kept getting attacked by this reddish orange waspy thingy that was a mexican spy... But very fun.  Then I kidnapped her... went to my house so I could finally show her a picture of Blake since shes never seen him.  Then decided to randomly drive around.  Stopped by Atlanta Bread Co. and almost visited Joe.  Drove... Drove some more.  Showed her the WalMart she had never seen... Then we decided to go see Sharma.  He sounded very happy that we were coming, so it was fun to brighten his day... Course he lives out in Timbuktu and the drive is rediculous, but we had fun just sitting in his room chatting. 

Dinner with parentos, and then....

Anchorman!  Yay!  Finally saw it.  Very funny.
Saw Paul, complimented the highlights while buying drinks from him... tried to say hi to Sean but he pretty much just glared at me (or so it seemed... it coulda just been that it was really busy...) 

Saw the best trailer reel that I've seen in a while... extended trailers of collateral and wimbledon... Taxi... which... well hopefully jimmy fallon has learned to act and will be very funny.  The wicker park trailer again (*grin*)  A very long without a paddle trailer (*grin twice*)... and then... a highly unexpected trailer for the Sarah Michelle Gellar japanese horror remake ""The Grudge"" ... (*huge grin*)  looked very very good.

yay for good days :o)"

Found out that all my friends from jj are now either potheads or worse, but it was still cool hearing about them.  I need to try to hang out with some of them... I really miss people like Carla and Soda and Toni and Joe Shmoe.  Dawn... Same... Flip (Philip Howell... Who I saw at Tech by the way!!  He was there for the Fuel concert!!  Didn't get to talk to him long though... but it was still cool seeing him)

Anyway I missed Laurie so much, so it was great seeing her.  :o)  

Hung out with Sarah for a little, and determined that her me and Laurie are gonna either go swimming on Thursday or get Rach to swim with us on Friday.

Saw I Robot.  Didn't get the Batman trailer that was rumored to be one of the trailers *damn*  The movie was pretty good though.

Saw King Arthur.  Very very good.  Kiera Knightly is awesome.  great movie.  

As far as trailers go... The trailer for Alien vs Predator actually made it look interesting (considering its set in an under-ice pyramid and has Lance Heinriksen... )  Saw a trailer for National Treasure... defiantely want to see that... Trailer for Exorcist the Beginning actually made it look interesting.  Saw Village trailers (*really big grin*)  Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow... not sure about that one.  Wicker Park!!!  :o)  Definately gonna see that.  But alas, no Batman teaser (considering thats probably all they'd have at this point) Not even a Blade Trinity teaser... when will there be one of those.  There is a poster however :o)  No trailer for Without a Paddle... 0:o)

You know you've been hanging around Sharma too long when you start saying w00t.  *starts singing ""All you need is w00t""  ... *DOH*

Started off the day hanging out with Rachie... looking at pictures from 8th grade... hehehe ... Then we picked up Zach and looked at more pictures from random times in high school (found elementary school ones too... including ones with Daniel... and old girl scout ones with Rachie in them to show Zach... hehe)  Gave them each cute pictures of eachother... (having doubles and all)  Found the hillarious pictures of Sean and Sean ... if you don't know what I'm talking about... well its a shame cuz its hillarious!!

So then we went to see Sean and show him the pictures... he laughed... and he didn't try to steal them and burn them, so I was impresed.  Its funny because apparently he had just been thinking about that.  I love looking at old pictures.  So much fun.

So then... I got to be a chaperone!  Woooo ... though.. I'm not sure how good of a job we did of actually chaperoning.. but thats ok.  Sharma and I went to the On the Bricks concert (we were charperoning Tressa and some of her friends... including a guy whos philosophy includes not believing in running... he's a drummer... so Sharma and I understood why we liked him ;op)  We had soo much fun!!  We ate at the CNN center... we missed the first band... showed up just in time for a band from Dublin Ireland... they were alright... it was better when the guy was just talking though... I love Irish accents... and so because of that Sharma and I were trying to perfect our Irish accents.  Then another band... that was pretty cool... 

And then Los Lonely Boys!!  Which... Ok I thought I put it in an old journal entry but apparently not... but I decided when watching the pepsi smash that 311 was on that they were amazing...  This reaffirmed it.  They are just sooo cool!!  And its a band who understands that they don't always have to have lyrics... but when they do they are great!!  

And then... Fuel!  For the second time this year *yay*.  They were better at Tech though... maybe its just cuz we were closer to the stage and there were more people around me that I know (especially including my boyfriend)  But they were still very awesome.  Sharma and I belted Hemorrhage.  I thought I was singing as loud as I could before that... but man... we belted that song like crazy.  Good times.  Noodle Salad.  Its all very great.

OH!  Also I saw Hannah!!  Sharma and I started walking away to go find his sister and co.  and all of a sudden someone tackles me with a hug and it was her!  And I got to meet Stephen who... well I thought the last time they broke up was really going to be the last time...  guess not cuz they were all holding hands and such... I talked to him yesterday I'm surprised he didn't mention it... *shrugs*  So thats cool

Oh, and we have a section leader now... Jacob is going to lead us again ... yay!  I don't have to be section leader *happy dance*  I hope he doesn't want the clave part though... *gulp*

btw... Sharma... if you're reading this... GET AN LJ!!!"

"event","Ok... I don't really think all gay guys are feminine I was just making a stereo-typical joke.  Anjali was saying how she doesn't like the Cavaliers because shes feminist and they're an all guy corps... So (considering that we had just been given information that 80% of them were gay...from unnamed source) I told her that I would think her being feminist would make her like them... And thus the subject title.

... I didn't mean for the explanation of that to be so long...

Today was awesome!!  Seriously... awesome.  

It started with me getting an hour later start than I wanted... But from there it was great.  I love driving in areas where most people I know don't know their way around real well... but I do... Its so much fun!  I just love knowing where I'm going really well in an area where I shouldn't cuz I've only been there a time or three.  Thats how I felt driving to McE today to buy tickets.  And then I drove from there to NC which was even cooler cuz I knew exactly where I was going without knowing where I was going.  WoooO!

So got to NC... Started with Patrick walking up to my car right when I was pulling in... Joined by David and Brad... And eventually Troy.  Possibly recruited two people for Tech Band...one of which is a drummer *yay* ... Watched Cascades practice... and man... I have a new favorite corps... well not favorite but added to list of favorites.  I liked them practicing... but I LOVED them when they performed...

I'm becoming ever more convinced that I should try out for a corps before I age out.  

Stopped by home... waited for Daddy who was finally convinced to go.  Started by seeing Scott, Anthony and Heather.  Then Kira and family... From there Anjali, my daddy and I sat with NC band.  It was great seeing everyone (though as the band went by I realized that there was hardly anyone in there I know)  Saw people from Milton and Sprayberry (including E :o) ) Went and sat with Courtney, Anjali, and a Zach that was supposed to stay with NC (shh! don't tell!)  When Crown showed up it didn't take long to spot my roomie.  We yelled her name and she turned and smiled really big... it was great!!  They were great.  Cavi's were of course great.  Blue Scouts were cool... Cascades were awesome!!

So yeah.  That was my day. 

Oo and on another great note... big possibility of me and Courtney going on a road trip to see a show... possibly two if she likes and my parents like my idea that I came up with... might mean me missing the end of band camp show... but I'll survive... I'll show up at a game or two so...it'll be alright.   

Cavaliers... Bond Show.  AWESOME!!!!  Dude they whistled at one point... that was one of the coolest things... and then At the end of FULL retreat... ALL of the corps started playing from sea to shining sea.  That was definatley cool too...  And then Cavaliers (who of course won) did an encore thing.  Woo fun.

Oh... one last thing.  Scotts moving!!  He's going to Oregon to go back to school... he can't leave Quest... Thats just so weird...

So I went all the way to east cobb and sat around in front of a brusters for a little over 2 hours talking to her about random stuff.  Much fun.  I miss her... I hope shes able to do Quest next year.  

Leaving at about 4:10 kinda sucked though because it meant rush hour traffic.  Amazingly, I got to 75 and there wasn't as much traffic as I thought there would be.  Until I came to 575... which was majorly backed up.  So by the time I got to the barret parkway exit, I gave up on 575 and decided to drive on barret.  Sean was working at Chick fil a so I was able to stop by and visit him.  That was cool cuz I think I've talked to him 3 times since summer started.  We talked about doing a poker night which is good because it'll be nice to play poker with actual people for a change *yay*

Ok, so usually if I'm at home doing nothing I put on the sitcoms that I can ignore but still be amused by the jokes (Friends, Will & Grace).  But some of the funniest episodes were on today!  There was an episode of Home Improvement where they were playing music on random tool-y type stuff.  It was sooo funny!!!  Ok I guess you had to be there...  And then the episode of Will and Grace that was on next was one I didn't remember where Jack got turned on by a woman.  (ok so later he found out that it wasn't actually a woman)  but it was soo funny.  

Alright I really just said all that cuz I didn't really have anything else to talk about... so uh... later!!  Yay for good days :o)"

     So this is basically gonna be my attempt at summing up the past week.  Wish me luck.

1/2 the Political, All the Party  (An add for C2... not to be confused with C^2, who is an awesome person, not a drink...)
    Random interesting Slogan that I saw... was amused and wante to post it, but after a week, Im not really sure of the point.

Eat Brie.  French Kiss (Eclipse gum add)
     Same as the coke add... but whatever

""Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman.  that is detestable""  ~  A billboard in Charleston that I saw way too many times.  It pissed me off the more I saw it, but then I saw another billboard that made me feel better.  I don't remember exactly what it said anymore, but it was something a long the lines of constitution and equality and equal rights, that both gay and straight people deserve protection by the law... Well any way it wasn't anti-gay so it made me feel better.

Welcome to Moes :amount of times my dad said that when we passed a Moe's .... too damn many... Pretty much because we passed too damn many.  When returning a video to Blockbuster, there was an ambulance outside of it.  To this I proved my Point ""Moe's:  Show up in your car, leave in an ambulance""

Be Kind Rewind
     Watched a good deal of movies.  Mystic River was pretty good, but sad.  Cold Mountain...which I didn't want to see in the first place... was pretty good up until the end.  Had to end that way though I guess... Random horror movies.  Wanted to see Welcome to Mooseport (which was on a blue video cassette?!) but the raging storm yesterday killed my aunts vcr... which made us have to go out to buy a new one for her today.  That and a new answering machine.  I miss my aunt already :o(

""Mr Sandman, bring me a dream""
     I've finally decided that I must get the Comic book series Sandman by Neil Gaiman.  I swear, this guy is the most awesome person ever.  Went to Barnes & Noble... They had all of them except for... NUMBER 1!!!  ... *shakes head in disbelief*  Picked up some cute single comic book stories by him though.  Murder Mysteries looks great.  I started reading one short story a night from Smoke and Mirrors, and I'm so in love with that book.  

Ok I don't remember what other things I was going to use.

The beach was awesome.  I only went twice but it was worth it.  If I hadn't gotten burned the first day (and...something else)  then we probably would have gotten back 1 or 2 more times.  (I got burned on the back of my legs and on my back... me!  I don't burn at all... maybe a little in the cheeks but thats all!... it was very weird, and very painful)  I wish Florida's beach had been like that when I was there.  The water may not have been as clear... but I wouldn't give up those waves for anything.

Fourth of July was great... we actually went out and watched fireworks!  And it wasn't even by my suggestion!!!  For like, 4 of the past 5 years, I couldn't get anyone to go see fireworks while we were on vacation, but this year my parents wanted to...We had the perfect spot too.  This one bridge... where before the fireworks for that river started, you could see them everywhere in the distance.  Then there was lightning too.  And fireworks over water are the best.  Theres nothing like watching the water change colors with the fireworks.  Even better:  a little bit before they started there were 2 or 3 baby dolphins that went under the bridge.  Its been a long time since I've seen dolphins.

Aesome storm yesterday... but I'm a freak so... yeah

If anyone knows of a '86 Thunderbird hubcap laying around, let me know.

I can say this, I love my Aunt and I wished so much taht I didn't have to leave.  I really didn't want to come back, as much as I missed my friends.  I see her for one week each year... which is nowhere near enough.  And Charleston is just such a great place.  

on another hand, i think somethings wrong with me... and its very weird.  I think I'm imagining things, and it is that time of year when I get this way, but I was hoping I wouldn't have to go through it.  It'll get better though.  August just needs to get here quicker... on the other hand, i don't want it to come quickly because I want to have more time with my friends... oh well, we'll see.

sorry this is so long guys..."

Went to see Jack today... He was pretty nice, don't really feel like I accomplished anything by going except for getting to see the guy my parents are going to and know what hes like.  And I like him, so thats a plus.  But pretty much everything that can be said by a counselour in the kind of position I'm in, I already knew and felt... so... yeah.  That made him happy though... so thats cool.

Got stuff for band today!  Not really that exciting... but it brought back exciting memories of getting the first band stuff I got last year.  And like, looking at the schedule and remember what happened during 'band camp' last year... >.>

uh...yeah

I saw a random book today... its a story of these people in high school, and its told entirely through aim convos... I think I'd have to read it just knowing how much of my life has been told through old aim convos heh... wouldn't buy it though... 

Ya know, I've never been one to attract a lot of people... I've never really considered myself very attractive... But lately I've noticed a lot of flirting with me or checking me out... And ya know whats even better?  That I can say that I'm happily taken.  Besides, how can you not honk and whistle at two hot chicks about to walk across a really long bridge? :op

Sooo, I came back from Chattanooga today, and it was soo much fun!!  Of course, as a result I'm incredibly tired and I want to saw off my feet and knees, but it was great!  Between free ice cream, actually getting to play fun random games, and wandering aimlessly around a city... well just getting to hang out with Courtney was fun enough, but all of that just made it even better.

I didn't even get to see Crown rehearse because we got there at their lunch break... and I was with Rachie so...I couldn't make her stay ;op.   I got to see Angela though!  (future roomie)  I didn't realize she made it...I only knew she was trying out.  

Despite missing out on some dciness... My friday was pretty awesome.  Got to see David, Larry, Terrace, Anna, Williams, Johnson (with facial hair *gasp*), Signe... some various other people I kinda knew... and a bunch of people I've never seen before in my life.  Williams seemed pretty mad that I hadn't been by in a while.  Oh well.  I should visit more often.  Spent the day with Rachie and Zach, and it was great.  First Rachie and I went to Wally World cuz she had to get some car stuff done... wandered around for 2 hours... then the three of us went to eat and walked around the mall.  Went into Victoria's Secret... which... was pretty funny considering the company I was with.  Walked into a couple other stores... Rachie bought a purse... I finally found sunglasses that I liked.  Couldn't find another purse for me... I don't think I ever will.  

Had tacos for dinner last night... Its amazing how good those tacos are and that I can't find tacos anywhere near as good anywhere else.  My parents should open up a restaurant.  

I need to start practicing for next year.  I told myself I was gonna practice a lot this summer... doesn't help that I left my stick bag on the truck that was home bound... meaning my stick bag is at Sprayberry, awaiting my return.  I'm sure some annoying high schoolers got to it.  I guess they weren't necessarily *my* mallets... but I would have been able to keep them.  Oooo and the djun djun sticks.  I'm tellin ya, practicing with those would definately be a good way to rebuild chops.  *sigh*  I miss not *needing* to practice.  Course, I guess I did practice once a week at lessons... which just reminds me of the fact that Jessica never emailed me back... :o(  I miss her so much.

"event","Here it is, proof that blondes are both very stupid AND very smart :o)  Compliments of good friend David:

Three women go down to Mexico one night to celebrate college graduation, get drunk, and wake up in jail, only to find that they are to be executed in the morning, though none of them can remember what they did the night before.

The first one, a redhead, is strapped in the electric chair, and is asked if she has any last words. She says, ""I just graduated from Brigham Young University, and believe in the almighty power of God to intervene on the behalf of the innocent,"" They throw the switch and nothing happens.  They all immediately prostrate themselves; beg for her forgiveness, and release her.

The second one, a brunette, is strapped in and gives her last words, ""I just graduated from the Harvard School of Law and I believe in the power of justice to intervene on the part of the innocent."" They throw the switch and again, nothing happens. Again, they all immediately prostrate themselves; beg for her forgiveness, and release her.

The last one, a blond, is strapped in and says, ""Well, I'm from
Georgia Tech and just graduated with a degree in Electrical
Engineering, and I'll tell you right now, you ain't gonna electrocute nobody if you don't plug this thing in.""

And after all that, I still realllllly wanna know what they did... 

I'm so proud of myself!  For the second time in the past two weeks I'm getting up really early to spend time with a friend.  Yay!  This has been one of the most fulfilling summers I've had.  Its no Disney World like last year... that was awesome, but I still went to Florida which was also great.  (plus considering the end of last summer... this one is definately better...)  The one before wasn't near as good... towards the end it got great but... its not like having a whole good summer.  Actually now that I think about it... That summer didn't have near as huge of a negative thing happen as last year *and* this year... man thats crazy... ok nevermind... forget everything I just said.

"event","So last night, when I went to bed, everything was great.  I spent the night at my grandparents house, and everything about the day had been very good.  Later on, I was no longer confused about anything, things made sense to me, and I had no stress or cares in the world.  Went to bed at about 3, like always.  

So why I woke up at 7:15 in the morning with the worst migraine headache ever is beyond me.  Luckily my grandpa got up about the same time so I wasn't alone.  They didn't have any pain killers (actually they did, but they expired 4 years ago), so my grandpa had to go out to get some.  I tried to just lay back down, but it was so weird, the pain would move to wherever my head was touching a surface (both there and the front of the head... its like the pain split and formed to pains).  And since, lucky me, I have a very low pain tolerance, I was very nauseous with nothing to throw up.  My mommy came by before she went to work since she works at the same place where my grandparents live.  I got some tylenol, and luckily it eventually went away, but that was some of the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.  So as the pain went away I slept until 1 45 with a wet towel on my head, and woke up because my mommy came to check in on me after she had lunch.  Moms are so cool.

So that was my day, aren't you glad I shared?  At least yesterday was great.

In other news, I apparently get to go see the counselor guy next week.  Wahoo.  Its hard enough trying to talk to a close friend about whats going on, and now I get to tell an older male that I don't know at all?    Hmmm wish me luck with that.

The storyline is cute, They keep playing 311 music, but Sean Astin is in it, and its kinda scary to see him in this role.  'Bout time I get to see it.

Moving on...  Just as things are already somehwhat confusing, confusing things happen to make things even more confusing.  I'm sure its not as confusing as it seems, but even if its not confusing at all, its certainly not helping.  Now that you're all confused...

So I've started my very own weird work out plan... Since I'm going to Bergamo like, 3 times a week now to pick up food, I've started walking around the huge parkinglot/shopping center (with a little bit of jogging mixed in).  Not like going to a gym or anything, but it beats sitting in my car for 20-25 minutes while waiting... Also throw in doing a lot of sit ups a few times a week, and using the exercise bike a couple times a week... At least I'm finally doing something active.  And it doesn't require me signing up anywhere, or getting out and going somewhere (except in the parking lot case, in which case I'm out anyway and have 20 minutes to kill)  I usually do the bike thing right after I take a shower, which is the time I just lay around and wait for my hair to dry.  So yeah, its something.  yay me. 

Had the scariest dream the other night.  Its amazing how vivid it is, even still.  I guess different things were scary about both parts... And it even took me forever to fall back asleep after I woke up from it... I couldn't close my eyes without seeing it and hearing it.  At least the part after that was alright, still had villians, but we had Aragorn on our side (the other one I was alone... well me and about of people from a decade of a long time ago... they didn't last long though) ... so we kicked a little ass.  
Interesting point, has anyone seen a mirror in their dreams?  I realized theres never been a mirror, and I don't always look like me in my dreams.  *shrugs* interesting.

Course, that is a topic for discussion.  That song haunts me I swear!!  I can go for a nice long period time of not hearing the song, and then, at a very strategic moment, its everywhere.  And it used to be that it would just show up everywhere when I'd start thinking about Justin (years ago)  But now, its just any random weird-stuff going on moment.  Anyway... between 2 different tv shows where characters were watching it and crying, and then hearing a nice instrumental version of it in my favorite restaurant when I was picking up dinner (so I was only in there for like, 5 minutes)... and I've never heard it in there before.  I've been there so many times!!  Alright... I didn't expect that explanation to take that long...moving on.  (looked up the song to see who sings it... and I'm very dissapointed that the first result was Justin Guarini...  I can understand him showing up as a result if he covered it, but he didn't write it... thats so wrong... *is amused by the story of a friend taking his money*)

So welcome to Tequila Sunrise, where you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.  Or... something.  Two songs stuck in my head... sounded like it worked.  

I like this weird 'disjointed' look.  I like where the Subject  and emotion/music boxes are.  

Well I really don't have anything much to say, just wanted to give the new look notice with a post.  I'm home now so... Anytime anyone wants to do anything... call me!!  Mostly during weekdays... Weekends and nights usually aren't too good, however I can do stuff in that time period everyone once in a while.  

Love to you all.






Can anyone explain to me how I managed to have my lj name be dreamrose instead of DreamRose311?  ... weird"

"event","Wanna know something weird?  I bought plane tickets yesterday!  I've never done that before... course the first time I flew was just this last April so... I guess you can see why it'd be weird.  I need to get away.  I'm so excited about this trip because I really need to just get away from it all.  Its insane.  Its all just completely crazy.  Poll:  If you are really sorry about something, and feel really bad about it, how hard would you try to get it fixed?  Just wondering.  I think its all a sympathy plea... when someone says that they feel awful for completely ruining something... but then they don't really try that hard to find out why they are like that (or try at all for that matter).  Then, there are these things that happen that make me feel like I'm this horrible person, when I'm not... there is no reason that the person should make me feel that way.  Ugh, there are so many things wrong with this picture, and I can't even begin to list them all.  Some things that I was never meant to know or hear, are gonna haunt me forever, no matter how hard I try to make it go away, and it just makes it worse that the person doesn't try that to get if fixed.  Its apparently been this way for a really long time, so I think that calling someone twice in the course of probably like, 8 years or so is definately not enough.  And that really makes me mad; it hurts, it makes me filled with anger, and makes me wonder about hate... And I don't like that, because it takes a hell of a lot for me to hate someone.  No its not hate... its just anger... but since it makes me so mad, I have an even harder time trying to make it go away.  Its not my problem, and yet I'm left with a huge scar in my brain.  

Wow... That probably sounds like a lot of rambling, so I don't blame any of you that stopped reading... I didn't really mean for that to turn into a rant.  But I guess thats what happens.  I miss people.  I need to see everyone, but I leave on Wednesday so I don't have a lot of time to hangout until when I come back.  OOoo!  That reminds me... everyone please leave me a reply of when you are going on vacation so I know when not to call you... I'm gonna be gone June 2-9 and July 2-12.    So uh... Yeah.  Sorry for having a depressing sounding post.  later!

Ooo!  and of the Hero's test thing... I got Wizard too... but I forgot to copy the code and I don't feel like going back to the site right now."

I had this huge rant I was gonna put on here, but I've totally lost it... mostly cuz I'm talking to Paul online about game boy and old nintendo games, so I got distracted.

I got Sword of Mana for game boy!!!   I love secret of mana, its always been one of my most favorite games ever!  I think I wore out the cartridge from playing it so much.  Anyway... maybe I should play gameboy insted of trying to play all 1000000 games of free cell...

"event","I've always said that I've been perverted for a very long time, tonight made me remember how I got my 'dirty mind'.  


Best Concert Ever

It was amazing.  First of all... it opened with Morris Day and the Time.  Which...was awesome.  I couldn't really remember any of the songs except for Cool, The Bird, and Jungle Love (;o) )  But they were amazing.  A very well kept secret.  

Seriously, if I was born in the right time, I would definately be in love with Prince.  The man is amazing.  Hes a musical genius, he can move like no body else, he can definately command control of the room, he's sexy (but Blake is sexier :D) , and hey... hes only 5'2""  ^-^  .  The whole thing was non stop energy, from songs that just faded into eachother, having an all out jam session with his musicians which was just incredible... sitting solo with his acoustic purple guitar on a stool, doing very mellow versions of Little Red Corvette and Cream (!!!), singing blues (...wow...)...   Sign o' the Times was awesome.  People only remember him for his high pitched voice (only one of three men who should ever be allowed to sing high notes... if you can name the other two, I'll be proud)... his range is amazing, from a low deep bass sound, to those incredible soprano notes.  And geez... give him a guitar and watch those fingers move... 

Seriously, he is a musical talent that few people really appreciate.  He is a legend that should transcend the generations like others do, but no one really understands him.  For those of you who claim to be lovers of the best of music, I dare you to look beyond the controversy surrouding Prince, and actually listen to his music.  You'll be amazed at what you were missing out on.

Big Bro~  Thank you sooo much for going with me!!! No one else that I know could have truly appreciated that as much as you.  See ya over the summer!!"

"event","Thats right, its finals week.  I'm el screwedo, to put it lightly.  I should have gotten an A in weather... but the most i can get is a B.  Stupid mistakes on the CS tests have made it hard to get an A in there, though I know I'll pull it off, and the A in chemistry *should* still be doable... but lets face it, I'm stupid.  Not stupid as in dumb or anything, but just...i dunno...stupid.  So since 930ish pm, I've been having the most awful few hours.  Originally, I had it all worked out.  Study chemistry for most of the day, and start calc for 2-3 hours before going to bed at a resonable hour, say 12ish.  Then get up at 8 am, take the chem final, and finish studying for calc before the 250 final.  At 930, I ordered dominos, and decided (key word, decided, if not for that random impulse... well... i'd be so far beyond screwed that... welll i dunno its late gimme a break) to make sure the final was at 8 and not say, 8 30 or something.  Good thing I did... turns out the calc final is at 8 and the chem final is at 250.... Pissed beyond belief, and far into the state of nausea... and then, I'm sitting here, and I realize what has happen on 2/3 tests in calc.  The thing that has happened that has just barely kept me from getting an A...something I didn't think at the beginning of the semester would be possible.  There are two main things that contribute to my afore mentioned stupidity:  Forgetfulness, and self-doubt.  The former, is a trait that I'm pretty sure is inherited, from a 10x more forgetful than me father, and a slightly forgetful mother.  Its a horrible feeling, and it makes it hard to learn lots of stuff.  Even if I do learn lots of stuff, me brain has problems holding on to it all.  The latter, is caused by the former, in a sense that the forgetfulness can make me half remember 1 real way to do something and 1 made-up-by-the-residue-of-things-forgotten way of doing something.  Because of this, I end up not doing either, and just working a problem up until the point of divergence (haha calc 3 word haha) and instead of picking one to take a shot at more points, i do neither and just get what i can before that point.  I guess I have a agood reason for doing neither...theres always thsoe teachers that will count off for you doing something wrong instead of just not counting you either way... But thats rare.  And why haven't I learned from this mistake?  If you can't figure out the question to that, then thank goodness theres someone worse than me.  (Answer:  CUZ I'm forgetful...)  So in short, as tomorrow I go to my doom of finals and make the same freezing up and forgetting mistakes, wish me luck and memory, for I will need it.  Not really though, because there is no possibility anymore of an A in calc, and I only need to half ass the test for a B.  Just like weather.  Isn't life swell.

At least its almost summer and I won't have to think for a while. 

Luv to you all, and good luck on any finals, whether they are next week or in a month."

// Wednesday, March 17  12:52 am

Alright, I've been meaning to post for a while now, so heres what I can remember.  
First of all, I found out earlier last week that one of my favorite actors, Jonathan Brandis, died back in November.  It was weird how much it upset me, because it is not like I knew him or anything.  However, he was very talented, even at a very young age as the stuttering Bill in IT.  His talent was never appreciated very much, which is a shame.  He attempted to commit suicide.  A friend came into his house, called 911, and he didn't die until the next day.  I found this out, and I cried.  I couldn't believe how much I was crying for someone who I never knew.  He will be missed though.  By me as a fan, and by his family and friends, my prayers go out to them.

AQ had another competition.  It went great, at least from my perspective.  I've never felt so great about the performing aspect of it.  I just hope I can do it again :)  We only scored an 82.6 though.  Pariah wasn't there, so I don't know how they are doing.  However, they are going to Dayton and San Diego now!!  which is awesome.  Thursday night.  Meet Quest.  Go to http://www.atlantaquest.net for directions and where and when and such.  Come support us!  And see us if you can't make any other competitions :)

Well most of the other stuff I was gonna post before today I have forgotten, so I will get started on today's events.

Ok, so I was told that I had to go check out the new wing of the Student Center because they had finally opened it, at least to people for walking through.  I will go ahead and say its awesome.  Very well layed out, and it just looks nice.  The Italian place looks great!!  :)  Anyway... So I wasn't going to take a bus there cuz I didn't feel like waiting, but just as I started walking, one showed up and I decided to take it anyway.  Goodthing I did.  When I sat down, I noticed a bag that someone had left behind.  Now, I very often see stuff left on the bus, but its usually stuff with no name or address.  This time there was a name.  I'll leave out all the annoying details about the bus stopping in a weird spot for about 20 minutes... anyway I ended up walking most of the way to the student center.  It was pretty.  When I got back, I looked up the girl's name from the 2 bills and the box in the bag and got her email address.  I sent her an email letting her know that I had it.  A little bit later I got an email back, not from her but from her mother.  She was visiting her daughter and had offered to mail her bills and the box for her and had left the bag on a bus.  Anyway, long story short, after a couple of emails and phone calls, she came to my building and I gave her the bag.  She handed me a card.  I was very happy, not only was she a nice person, but she bought me a thank you card!!  What a nice woman!  When I got to my room, I opened it and there was a 20$ bill!  I didn't expect anything, I didn't do much, just picked up the bag and sent emails, and its not like I had to go far to give it to her, she came right to my building.  So that was pretty cool.  Made me feel happy... hell I was happy just with a thank you card :D  Our emails to eachother were pretty funny too.  I had left two messages on my cell phone because the first time I gave the phone number to my boyfriends dorm.  The second time it still wasn't quite the right number (oops).  What I never call myself, what do I need to know it for!!  hehe.  Anyway, so she was saying it made her feel good to know that a smart person at Tech could forget their phone number, she said it gave an excuse for old people.  :D  Very funny.  Very nice.  I like nice people ^-^

Anyway, so that was my day.  Have a good Shamrock day, and don't forget the green ;o)  ... man that makes me wish our pub was open... In the St.Ctr wing, theres going to be a non-alcoholic pub called O'Jackets... What a perfect place to go for an Irish holiday...oh well theres always next year.  I still say they should serve alcohol and call it O'Buzz :D"

Beachy gets cooler everyday... I hope I can be on the same hall as her next year... I'm gonna miss everyones crazy loudness and hillariousness and obsession with the OC.

So much that I have that I want to talk about.  But I don't want to talk about that.  Isn't that funny.  Or confusing.

I'm tired.  Can't sleep... too agitated.  Shoulders and neck hurt.  Head is getting there too.  

On the bright side though, I have a visitor in two days :):):) Very exciting.  Makes me happy.  Apparently Sean might be coming too... I wonder if he'll even talk to me at all... most of his time will be spent in this building, the least he could do is come say Hi... *shrugs* oh well... I don't know why I even bother to care.  I guess because with how much I love and enjoy my friendship with people, it makes me sad to lose a great one for no reason.  

In reflection...maybe it wasn't even one worth saving... 

Pardon my bitchy ramblings, they have no meaning, just needed a ventage outlet.

"event","It snowed.  Wish I got to see the actual snowage.  Thats alright I got some cool pictures.  I wish I had my real camera with me though, that thing takes some awesome pictures.  It was soooo pretty.  Wish it had cancelled class...maybe I wouldnt have been so tired from going to another pointless CS lecture.  Thats alright.  The day was fun.  It was sleeting for a little bit too... its fun being pelted by small bits of ice...hehe 

And for those wondering the question:
Yes.  I went out in flip flops.  I actually didn't even know it had snowed this morning when I went to CS lecture... and I uh...didn't...wear my socks... But my feet still didn't freeze.  

Snow makes me contemplate things.  I don't know why.  Its kidna weird... despite how much I hate the cold, I'd love to just sit in the middle of a big field of snow (I guess sitting on a blanket so my bum doesn't freeze)  and just... stare.  Out into nothingness.  I have a lot to think about lately, since because of bad timing I still haven't gotten to have my vent from the weekend.  And its almost the next weekend.  Seems almost moot though.  

Yay for friends.  They rock my world.  I'm sorry I'm kinda having a flaky week... half of it really is just bad timing though, its weird.  Today was kinda surreal I think.  I feel bad and want to apologize to Kev about the whole not studying for Chemistry thing, but he won't talk to me, and he doesn't read this so...yeah.  

Thats alright... not studying for chemistry was definately worth the day I had.  I can always study on Sunday."

ANYWAY
So I wanted to do my new (starting last week) Thursday ritual of going to Woodies, having a ""snack"" (a bowl or three (usually 2) of salad) while listening to a cd and reading my Java book (since I uh... don't go to lecture.  Speaking of which, I went today, nope no Pop Quiz.  I was so sure there was gonna be one... damn that means I have to go Tuesday ARG) and catching up/getting ahead on whats going on.  Well last week when I did this, Sharma came to me about 30 minutes after I got back and asked if I wanted to go eat with him... which I couldn't...cuz I had just gotten back... So today I thought I'd ask if he wanted to eat with me and then I'd study after he left, and he said sure.  Well the long version of the story requires too much typing...but after like 15 minutes of waiting on him, he comes up to me and says hes gonna go play basketball instead _ _;

But thats ok.  More java studyage time.  So, I'm sitting at Woodies, and I've been there for a while, when all of a sudden I see Jeff (cool drumline guy) standing in front of me.  So I said hey, and we talked for a couple minutes, and he asked if I wanted to go sit with him and people, and I was almost done with the chapter so I said sure.  Matt was there too (pit guy) So it was fun.  Got to talk to someone I never see, and someone I only see on Wednesdays.  It was neat.  

Then I left to go to West Side Market... and it is soooo beautiful outside today.  I wish I didn't have soo much Java homework today (as much as I enjoy it) cuz I woulda been out there all day today if I could have.  Soooo very nice.  

They didn't have blank tapes at West Side...kinda sucks, but its alright, cuz my Daddy's gonna tape the Sharon Osbourne show tomorrow for me instead.  (311 is gonna be on it... ^-^)

Table Tennis competitions are pretty cool... kinda interesting.  I was watching the last few minutes of one before the Tech-Maryland BBall game.  

GO JACKETS!!!! WOOOO!
 ok enough procrastinating...java time."

So, apparently today is store day, because everyone is oging to the store.  oddly coincidental eh?   I read C^2's away message, and it says shes at the store.  I just got back from west side market, and apparently my roomie is at Kroger.  Woulda loved to go with her... cheaper for one thing.  Plus we're really starting to like...talk more often.  Which is cool.

Speaking of cool, I've hung out with Sharma a lot this week, which is cool cuz I don't really see him much.  But after our lab on wednesday we got out WAY early... So we went to the student center, had pizza hut and watched Masters of the Universe, then played pool.  Then today we sat around in his room listening to songs with lots of bass and throwing little paper airplanes around (cuz he got this cool day by day calender for xmas, where each day is a new little airplane....spiffy) and then we came down here and watched family guy for like, 2 hoursish.  Friends are awesome.

The possibility of living with one or more guard girls next year kinda scares me.... random thought.  I mean, itd be different if it was a guard girl that I've known for a long time and that shoulda been a drummer anyway...

I like this building... oh well

HOLY HELL
Alright, so that stupid little buddylinks adware worm.... Yeah I got that yesterday cuz I was stupid and thought Aneil was actually sending me something... Yeah... So I searched my computer and deleted every instance of it that I could find.  Apparently not.  Its back.  It decided to put itself back on my computer without asking me.  #$%^&*&^%$%^&*(  Well at least theres an option to turn off the 'sending to friends' thing.  

So Sharma told me to be in my room at 2 30 tomorrow?  What the hell is that about...

Bought two new cds...finally got evanescence... and I bought the soundtrack to 50 first dates (cuz of a 311 cover of The Cure's love song...) and it rocks.  Its awesome.  All covers of 80's love songs, and all in a sort of reggae/jamacan very laid back and awesome style.

Alright.... time to kill buddylinks and to do java"

Unfortunately, both of those two people live on East campus.  I live on West.  Go figure.  So the only two reasons I'd ever be on that side of campus past bus running time is spending time with my wonderful guy, or studying for a test.  Stingerettes... which are usually a great thing, claim in a book to run until 2 30 and claim online to run until 2, or at least to accept calls until two.  Or something.  I called at 1 35.  Got the answering machine right away.  Called over and over and over....well you get the point.  Mucho pissed off.  Had to walk back to this side of campus in the very cold.  

Whats worse... is I had to have someone to walk with me (cuz lets face it... college campus... at 2 am... with a ratio that this school has...yeah)  mostly because I know neither of them would ever let me walk alone.  So, yeah... Blake was about to go to bed, but he walked with me anyway, I felt bad, but...oh well.  What can ya do right?  maybe I can email the stingerette people and ask them what exactly their policy is.  ARG

On a good note though... at least I'm totally getting the calc 3 thing.  Wahoo.  Hopefully I'll do well on my test tomorrow."

Why don't people talk?  I don't get it.  I have a problem with that... but unfortunately since I've lived with that problem, I find myself doing it on occasion too.  But then, at the same time, knowing that it's occuring and knowing that it is one of my biggest issues with people in the general sense, I'm a lot better at not letting myself do it.  The one exception is in the setting of where I grew up with it.  Maybe thats a good thing.  If I'm gonna commit the 'not talking' crime, thats the place to do it.  

So I was telling my parents about my Saturday morning, and the hecticness of not knowing where Rach was and all, and my Dad, in a sort of way of hinting at something and trying to make me feel bad, says soemthing along the lines of ""well I'm glad you understand the knowing when you need to call thing.""  I wish I could remember the actual quote.  It was worse sounding than that... A.  I'm sorry, who wasn't online at all last week?  ~ If you have issues with knowing how late I get in, turn off the little alerts.  Stop making me feel guilty when you have no right.  B.  It's a two way street bub.  C.  I DID CALL DAMNIT.  I had only talked to my Mommy once that week, and I hadn't talked to him at all, so I thought I would call and tlak to both.  He wasn't there, but he knew I called because my mommy told him and then he called from his cell.  I think I do pretty good considering how often anyone I know talks to or even sees their parents.  

And if he was referring to the other thing he might have been referring to, well theres reasons for that.  Its a shame I can't feel open enough to talk about it.  **edit**
      ** Turns out that he was referring to the other thing sorta... Basically about calling to let them know if plans have changed or something so they know when to come.  He was referencing a specific instance... And its totally justifiable.  How often do I not call about that sort of thing?  NEVER ARG

I don't understand how he thinks he has any right to make me feel like crap about anything at all ever.  

~> points out that a great example of the not talking thing is the whole Thanksgiving drama.  Yeah, we knew a week ahead of time that his bro would be in town.  But ya know what?  He also knew for a week that we'd be going to my grandparents on Friday.  If he wanted to do something, he should have said so earlier than 15 minutes in advance.

If any of this doesn't make sense or anything... then just ignore it.  Its mainly a vent.  That was really the reason I created this journal so long ago in the first place... to vent... I don't do it too much because of how many friends lists I am now on.  But thats alright, I like having friends :o)  I love you all!!!! :):):):)"

Well, other than the fact that today sucked...its been going pretty good.  Between the busses being mean, and my TA leaving before I could get my java test... Oh yeah that and my bloody knee and holey jeans...thats right I've had a klutz day.  Oh yeah, and did I mention that despite the fact that I was at Kev's for like, 3 hours we still didn't get that much studyage done... So yeah, I'll be studying like mad crazy on sunday night and all day monday.  Now I can study all night... ALL NIGHT STUDY  *friends quotage...sorta*

However, I have come to the conclusion that Caldwellians are totally awesome (I live in the building Caldwell).  When I first mentioned that I was gonna be selling suckers, they were all over that in the sense of ""yeah! We'll help you out...we'll definatley buy suckers...""  Well, 25 in a week and a half isn't *that* great a number, but at least they are buying them.  Sharonda and my roomie Beachy in particular.  Which is awesome.  Melissa and I have been talking a lot more often lately, which is great.  AND my PL told me about how all of us are going to go to dinner on Tuesday to some spiffy restaurant...and for the first time... I can actually go to a group outing!! Cuz its on a weekday...WOOOOO!!!!  She was very excited when I said I was pretty sure I'd be going.  So yay, for the first time I'll actually be able to find out if I fit in with the people I've been living with for like, 5+ months...yeah... 

The other great thing about Beachy and suckers... is whenever she cleans our message board, she'll still put a sucker message up :) and her messages...WAY more convincing than mine.  Yeah.  She rocks.  

Lets see.  I don't really know what else to say...Other than theories of someone not being online are actually true...and worse than I thought... But whatever.  I honestly don't know if I care or not anymore.  Its hard to tell.  whatever...  
I had a lot more stuff to say but have forgotten it all.  So I shall go back to my java-age.  Its crazy, we're doing the mad complicated thing now, which is weird because in the same homework was this rediculously stupid and easy program... *shrugs* whatever.  This is interesting.  Hope I can finsih it woo!"

So last week, I was all sad like cuz I didn't have java homework... and when I started this weeks...well it had been so long that I kept procrastinating cuz I didn't wanna do it.  Theres nothing like making the program free of errors and then watching it run without problems.  Who knows... if I'm still good once it gets to the really hard stuff, I might even consider being a TA...

So wish me luck when I go talk to the COC undergrad advisor.  I'm hoping they'll say that they are gonna offer a minor in CS...because that sounds a lot more fun than double major... *shrugs*.

I press my ears against the wall 
to realize there's nothing at all 
I press my eyes to the window screen 
to realize there's nothing in between 
I close my eyes to feel again 
that nothing ever stays the same 
i close my eyes to fear again 
the liquid that takes all the pain 
I sit and watch the distant need 
that cracks me up and makes me bleed 
a fragment of eternety 
is all i ever need to see 
Everytime you say my name 
you reinvent the pain



Yeah I haven't talked to David still Idk.He tells all his lil fucking friends that i'm in love with him...its really pissing me off."

"event","""Forgive Me""

Can you forgive me again?
I don't know what I said
But I didn't mean to hurt you

I heard the words come out
I felt that I would die
It hurt so much to hurt you

Then you look at me
You're not shouting anymore
You're silently broken

I'd give anything now
to kill those words for you

Each time I say something I regret I cry ""I don't want to lose you.""
But somehow I know that you will never leave me, yeah.

'Cause you were made for me
Somehow I'll make you see
How happy you make me

I can't live this life
Without you by my side
I need you to survive

So stay with me
You look in my eyes and I'm screaming inside that I'm sorry.

And you forgive me again
You're my one true friend
And I never meant to hurt you"

I just take my razor and let it slide
I cut so I wont cry
And when I say I'm fine its just another lie
Threapy no longer effective
I'm tired of being labeled insane, stupid, deffecive

Hurt by so many, but hurt them just the same
So I guess for my hurt I am to blame
I'm the one that fell in love and believed the I love Yous
When it comes to how much I hurt the maximum I choose

So many really love me, but I only love a few
I cant even look in the mirror and say I love you
My heart's been broken my trust lost
What will it take to be happy again?
What is the cost?

I cry myself to sleep and even in my nightmares I weep
My razor the only rememdt for my pain
One day I'll take this razor and slide it across my vein"

"event","If I could tell you how much this hurt me
More than it could hurt you
I'd have to set my pain free
Torturing me, coiling my insides in a screw

I feel like light headed again
Your heart wasn't enough to break my fall
We're not going to be all smiles and kisses in the end
I have to leave now, leaving you at a stall

I'll never get to feel this unknowingly
So kill my slowly
I swear to you on everything I am
I just have to let this end

I've been hurting for a while
I've been walking for miles
Just to see your face
But all I see is myself falling from grace

Let the sun scorch the skies
Like that time I died 
Everything I could ever be
Everything that we'll never see

What am I doing to us
What have I done
I left you out in the rain watching your love rust
Looking down my shotgun isn't fun

I know what it's like when memories break your heart
I know what it's like to feel the pain from the start
I know how to break it
My problem is I can't take it.

Watching it glisten in the moonlight
feeling the cool metal on my warm skin
Why am i hesitating?
It used to be so easy
Seeing the blood pour from me
Letting the pain wash over me
But things are different now...

I have you to catch me when i fall
To make me smile again
i no longer feel the thread i hold on by will snap
I used to think nothing ever had a happy ending
I guess i was wrong
Because i found mine...
In you

point to never let anyone know more about you than<br>you want them to and do a
very good job of it. You're there one minute and<br>gone the next leaving them in
wonder of who you really are. A mature and normally<br>calm individual, quiet and
enjoy spending many hours of the day on your own,<br>most likely preferring night
to day . You love the dark and some may find you a<br>bit strange. You seem to be
rather distant and cold making hard for people to<br>get close to you, though you
probably like the distance they usually keep. You<br>probably wear make-up, but
concentrate more around your eyes than anything.<br>You know the effect you have
and enjoy keeping people in wonder.</p>

You constantly look over your<br>shoulder and wonder who is judging you...even<br>when you are alone.  So naturally, you have<br>become a little paranoid and pessamistic.  Your<br>personality can be one demensional but<br>confusing.  You are constantly bored with life<br>and wish that something could spice it up.  You<br>have a unique view on life and have identified<br>the problems with school society  (Ex...what<br>makes popular people, how the student mind<br>works...) You would rather be alone because you<br>hate being hurt.  You tend to think that no one<br>understands you, not even your parents /<br>guardians / friends.  But that is just the<br>opposite!  The people who love you want to<br>help, but they don't know how because they have<br>a feeling that they will say something wrong<br>and turn you away.  You have to let them know<br>that you are willing to hear what they have to<br>say...and it might do some good to listen to<br>them. <P> Some fields you might consider going<br>in when you are older...Judge, author,<br>songwriter, producer, therapist, psychologist,<br>philosopher, or forensic scientist.  You need a<br>job where you can express yourself and your<br>views on life.  Or you need a field where you<br>can judge others and predict what is going on<br>in others life.  Either way... you have the<br>personality to get you a good job that will<br>support you throughout life.

Mad at the world, eh?  You have a tendency to...<br>freak out easily.  Overly emotional about<br>everything, you're most prone to bouts of<br>cruelty and moodiness.  Other people may be<br>afraid of the fact that you explode so easily,<br>but at least you're honest... even if you're<br>honest about not liking anything.

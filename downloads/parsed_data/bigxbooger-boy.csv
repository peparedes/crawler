"event","I havent updated this in quite some time. I found out that my sister (Allie) doesnts like that boy Kenny, It was just something her friend said to mess with me.
Wowzers, Allies actuly going to take me to band camp tomarrow, Im going to play the Sax, I dont know how to, But Allies going to teach me how to read music, and what everything means, so now all i need to know is how to play the Sax.
My big brother josh just got a new game for the computer,  think its Doom 3, but im not sure. Its pretty fun, if you like killing stuff.
This is all i've got.

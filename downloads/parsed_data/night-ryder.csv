"event","This week seems so long but i guess before you know it the summer will be over.  I am bored at work which make time go even slower!

I would love to have four day weekends every week thats the way the world should work for Tuesdays to Thursdays.

Apparently my wonderful ex-roomate has given birth to a spawn.  The poor child doesn't have a hope of a normal or decent life with her as the mother.  

There is a new German resturant that Dylan and I are going to try tonight. I hope it is as good or better then the Shnizal Haus.

This weekend I am actually going to work a shift at Jungle Jim's.  I figure that I help them out while helping myself out cause God know I need money!

Mike Ferdinand is back in town.  I was talking to him and he is doing well out west but misses the maritimes.  He looks the same as he did but it was just strange to see him after all four years and all the shit that we went through/put each other through, I think its really nice that we even still acknowledge each other existance and after all the torture and torement that i put him though for him to look me up ment a lot to me...is that pathetic?  Dylan isn't too fond of the whole Mike's return but he has nothing to worry about.

Mom has had one rough go this time and it has been really hard on me, a lot harder then most times she gets sick.  I have been so stressed out and its not getting any better because right now Mom has my aunt from BC and my sister to take care of her but come the first week in september and that responsibility becomes mine, plus school,plus work, plus Dylan and the house.  I'm going to have to figure out a way I can manage all of these things cause I have to to do them all, thats just life I guess.  I really do hope that mom starts feeling better cause she can possibly live very long like this and i have no idea what I would ever do with out her, I'm a momma's girl.

I have been doing my laundry at mom's cause I am scared of the spiders in the basement and it is so much better to do it there anyway, first it free and second someone else will put the clothes in the dryer!

Anyway I am boring I hope everyone is enjoying the rest of their summer.

"event","I am ready for bed and it is onloy lunch time. We have a killer party that went too early in the morning and now I am still paying for it today.  I can't bounce back like I use too.

Today is not a day for people to annoye me cause I have no patients for anyone today.

I had  gathering for Dylan's birthday.  The intitial plan was to go swimming and have a BBQ and get loaded but we endded up not swimming because it was cold and windy.  I think everyone had a good time and Mark showed up so Dylan was happy.  There is however and issue that has been bothering me all week.  Dylan has invited Mark to come live with us and I have a have a bad feeling about that.  Its not that I don't like Mark cause he is a really nice person but I don't think it would be good for our relationship.

There is a new resturant that is openning tomorrow.  It is called Old Germany.  I am taking Dylan there for a date on Wednesday.  I hope the food is as good as the Schizel Haus in Aulac...this place is going to make fresh German breads that are really good both taste and for you! They will also have fresh baked deserts and stuff too.  I can't wait to go!

I hope everyone has enjoyed their summer.  I know I did but I am also really looking forward to retuning to school for some odd reason?  I have had enough of this full time work thing.

On my lunch time I have a huge amount of house work to do but I might just say screw it and sleep instead!"

"event","Vacation was amazing, we had such a great time!  We were delayed by a day but alls well in the end.  First we went to Dylan's cousin Clairs house in Charlottown.  She was wonderful and the food couldn't have been better. They fed us these marinated steaks that make me drool just thinking about them.  We stayed and partied with them that night and we think they may have heard us knocking boots in Dylan's younger cousin's bed...was that wrong?  

The next day we packed up and headed to Cavindish to our cottage that we rented and  unpacked and headed back to Chrlottown for the Barenaked Ladies concert, which was wicked and I don't even like that kinda music...but the beer helped.  The opening acts sucked but as soon as the ladies stepped on the stage it was so much fun...Dylan and I did notice that in a crowed of thousends of people there was three black people and we were all girls.  We headed back to the concert and drank our faces off and went on an adventure down the boardwalkeverything was closed so we broke in to a mini golf and climbed on all the statues that they had and took incriminating photos of us on things like a giant lobster.

The next day we relaxed and went deep sea fishing that night which I have to say was the best part of the vacation!  I caught the biggest fish!  We drank our faces off more and fed beer to our captin.  I recommend everyone try this.
After Deepsea fishing we were hammered so we went to sandspit and went on the rides which made Dylan a little ill. We later returned to the cottage where we meet to people from Cape Pele they were fun and liked to party up a storm like us so we hung out and drank with them.

On the last day we went to the Boardwalk and bought so stuff and then came home. 

In the afternoon we went to Halifax to see my mom who is in the hospital there...that was kind of a damper on the trip but she is slowly recovering as of today.

We also went to the casino. 

This weekend we are laying low and saving money cause we are going to try to go to PEI again just to go fishing with Maria and Justin next weekend."

I know we live together but we don't really get to spend the alone time together there is always people around so needless to say this is an afternoon that i am really looking forward to!

No big plans for the weekend I have a few people I need to visit and house work to do but apart from that I am taking it easy and enjoying the nice weather.  I think I should start taking more long weekends.

Yesterday there was fumes from the roof being worked on so the office was pretty much closed and as for today all of our systems are down so we have nothing to do..I'm going to Walmart in a few minutes...Dylan woke me up while I was sleeping and I really don't like that especially when he goes out drinking and comes home  passes out snoring while laying half on top of me.  So needless to say I was the devil this morning when I woke up.  

Last night we went out to see The crew camping in South Hampton...the bugs were so bad I wanted to leave.  I hope they are still alive!

I saw an old pal I haven't seen in awhile.  Lionel was just passing by me while i was walking home for break.  I miss hanging out with him he is so much fun!

The weather has been messed up today but as long as I can get some kind of a tan this weekend I'll be super happy!

This has been a pretty slack day...we watched the rain, the office had so weird smell for the morning, and I talked to clients...thats about the extent of my strenuous day.

 I finally got to see Whitney and Ray's little Georgia and she is so cute!  It amazing how little babies are, I'm always scared to break them when I'm holding them.

  Dylan put a sub woofer in his car last night and Kellie and i had the wonderful time of looking for speaker wires....Dyaln didn't know what size to get and we asked the car guy at walmart and he had no clue what to use.  we fially ended up getting some at the source.  I was glad that task was over.    

I'm sitting at someone else desk and it is so muggy here its gross.  My skin feels wet almost.

Dylan and I have big plans to go to the cottage this weekend and this time we don't have anyone coming with us that can ruin our plans!!!

Went for a booze cruise with a sober driver and got my hair did.  I am looking for anxiety pills if you know of anyone let me know my doctor is the kind that says you need to excerse more but I think an hour+ per day is more then enough excersise to relieve stress. Things have been hectic considering school work has become my life.

It was fun!  i was so drunk I went home and drank most of a bottle of Pepto and tok some gravel and the next day I woke up feeling great. I spent most of Saturday washing and waxing my car.  I then went to Moncton shopping with Kellie.  Sunday we went for a drive around Parsoboro,  checking out the sites....which there are none but it was  aq nice day to be outside!

I will be all by myself tomorrow....yahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! Dylan is going somewhere with his mother and grandfather.  This will give me a chance to clean and not have Dylan dirty up behind me.  I wanted to paint this weekend but I am out of money...on top of the car purchase this week I had to go shopping and buy some new outfits...which make my butt look even hotter then usual.

There was a sale on liquor yesterday and Maria and I picked up a bunch.  We had to taste test last night and really didn't drink that much 1/2 liter bottle each but were so sick today reaqlly sick I think the wine is bad so even if it looks like a good deal its not!!!!

We said our good byes to Mark on Monday. he is going out west to work and Dylan was upset to see him leave.

I have been spending a lot of time thinking about the changes that need to be made to the house inorder for me to be happy and I have decided that it would be cheaper tobuy a whole new house which I can't do until i have this job permenetly. 

Jeff comes home in just a few days and I am excited to see him.  It has been a long time since we have hung out and had a drink or two like old times!

Tonight I think I will BBQ hamburgers.  I make them really good!  Then Dylan and I have plans to go fishing....whether I go or not is another story.

i am trying to drink all the water you should in the run of a day and it is really hard.  All I do is keep running to the bathroom.  My stitches a healing well I think I won't take off the bandage to check. I fell down the stairs Friday and it looks like Dylan beats me.

We might be getting another car...its a dark blue 2001 honda accord 2 door fully loaded leather...its really nice and has few miles on it so I can drive it to school.  Dylan really wants it too! My only fear is that if we get the car I'll never see him because he will always be out driving.

Went to Moncton yesterday shopping with Kellie.  We stoped at the sex shop and I bought Spanish Fly A.K.A horny juice......It works! I took more then you should I think.  I fyou mixed it with drinking look out cause you would be all over the place and that stuff is good cause both the girl and the guy can take it!"

I really am starting to not like Dyaln's disrespecful friends who think our house is theirs... actually they would treat their own house a lot better.  I think that is the last weekend for me and all that retarded shit.  My friends are so much better they don't make messes they don't stay for days and they have respect. Dylans friends might be older but they don't act it and that is why they are all losers!  I know that I am going to have to say something cause there is no reason for me to not want to stay in my own house on the weekends.  It would eb nice to go somewhere else or nothing at all would be fine with me.  I'll let you know how that goes tonight.

Oh and what I love even more is people macking in my fucking bed. Others having sex in the spareroom and keeping me up. No more!!!

I think Jeff should have the party regardless of his brother being there or not.  We can through a party in hos honor!

I want to buy a tent this week so we can start camping as soon as it becomes nice enough to go.  That sounds like way more fun to me then having people over every weekend.  And way less clean up!

I really didn't sleep last night so I am super bitchy....oh well sometimes thats the only time I will say what needs to be said.

I think that perhaps it is time to change the atomsphere on the weekends.  I get sick of partying at my house all the time not to mention that it takes me a whole day to clean the mess up the day after a party and you all know that Dylan usually doesn't help even though they are his friends. However, he did help this weekend, he did the dishes.  That another thing Dylan's friend sometimes don't get that yes we would like to go to bed a have really loud sex on the weekends but we don't cause at least one of his friends are down stairs and that kinda creeps me out. 
The bed room door got ripped of the wall, we don't know how that happened all I know is that all of us were just fucked up!

What with this new craze on group sex???  Why are people so eager to jump in bed with their friends and their friend's boy/girl friend? The more the marrier I guess.  I'm way to jellous to do it....unless there are chemicals and booze involved.  Anyway I hope to do something away from Amherst this weekend Moncton might be fun.  Who wants to go to the strip club friday...I might get my first lap dance!!!

I am 22 and I should almost be graduated from university like so many people my age but no.  Although I am not where i want to be educationally I do realize that it is because of the life I have lived that I have been lucky enough to find someone as wonderful as Dylan.  All couples have there moments but looking at the big picture you realize that the small trivial things really don't matter.  He trys so hard to be sweet and for that I appriciate him.  I went away from him for one night and I was so excited to come home that the drive seemed to last forever.  

I honestly think that that little trip made me realize that he is who I want to be with for many years to come.  For amyone who knows me that is a first!

Maria and I are getting memberships at the gym today to get our bodies lean and mean for the summer...and especially the beach.  I have got to start taking care of myself.  

Training in Halifax was .... boring as hell but I did get out of the office for two days and I did get to go to the Casino and loose some omney but it was all in good fun.  

I did find out that if I do get this job I will have to go to Halifax or Sydnye for training for a whole month.  I thought that I missed Dylan for one night I can even think about leaving him for a month but with the pay increase and job security I am sure I will survive even if I do become addicted to shopping again.

Well I hope everone has a great day freezing thier ass off.  Talk to you later

I have made a decision that in March I will start at the gym and after I lose ten pounds I  will reward myself with new nails.   I will be a barbie by summer minus the big boobs and blond hair. There is a bunch od girls that already go so at least I will have some encouragement.

Dylan and I went out for supper. it was good! We really didn't do too much cause he was sick and I was tired so we went to bed.

It is such a beautiful day and here I am wasting it indoors.  Oh well!!!!"

The price on the frame said one thing and when I went to pay for those lovely glasses that I don't even know if i like, the lady told me that I owed over a hundred dollars above the price marked... that is retarded!  So the friggin things endded up costing me well over $300.  For glasses!!!!!

On the plus side of things I am feeling better today.  I think being able to see will help me to feel even better.  I'm getting the new TV after work!! I am super pumped about that!  

Apart from school and work I really have no life and nothing to talk about so... talk to you later!!!

I lost my glasses over christmas and I have been too cheap to just buy new ones so my eyes are quitting on me.  I think today on my lunch I will go pick out new glasses so that I can see again and not be so messed up.  Oh how wonderful it will be to see!!

I'm getting a new tv tomorrow!!! A bigish one! It's 32"" but that better then what we have now, you have to stomp on the floor to get picture sometimes.

I miss my Dylan. Since he has been working at RB Dickey school I only see him at nights as opposed to four times during the day plus my nights.  This will be going on till the end of the month so I guess I'll just have to suck it up!

I proved to everone in the house on Friday night that I was a complete nut but if they knew the whole story they would hate the other party involved.

Some girl crazier then me tried to beat me up at Bam's.

It was good to see the crew that has just gotten back from out west. I still have to see Whitney and Angela.

I have come to the conclusion that I have no life once so ever!!!

This weekend sucked kinda, I mean I did things but I am so tried of sitting in that house and watching people mess it up after I spend all week cleaning it while i am working and going to school with no help once-o-ever, I mean I love him but I hate constantly cleaning up after him, if I wanted to clean up after someone I would have had a kid. I'm tried of it so much and one person everytime they left the house would leave both doors wide open and he was in and out for two days, not to mention puke all over both bathrooms that I have to clean up.  I am going to have to put my foot down or move out cause I'm not doing this anymore. Thank you for letting me bitch.

On an other note, I am keeping my fingers crossed that I'll get paid next week cause I have gone a month with no money. I hope everyone is wealthy, happy and in good health.

Oh I found this web site that allow me to make myself more paranoid then I already am. On this site you can put in the symptoms that you have then the site will give you a list of possible illnesses.....do you know how many things cramps in you feet bring up at least 20 diseases and they get worse as you go down the list. It start with something mild like low blood preasure and ends with sever cancer of the arteries. This web site is designed to make people like me retarded.

Kelsey (my sister) went out with us on Friday night it was fun and weird at the same time but I think she had fun her last night in town. We drank Saturday night too.  Melanie came down for the night and we drank and went to Dooly's. That poor girl sure knows haw to get herself in trouble. Yesterday I stayed in all day and did nothing. Saturday night I was the first one to leave the bar. I went home, was sick for a long time then I passed out hard till I was woken by a disturbed Melanie. People were at the house last night and I would not come down the stairs. 
My bra broke as soon as I got to work this morning. That was a perfect start to my Monday morning!
I feel soo bad for Kellie she goes to school all day then works a reddiculous amount of hours too. Hopefully now that Peter is gone she will have more day off.

On Tuesday Dylan and I are going to the lake for the night to do some drinking and four-wheeling and stuff. I have missed my friends, lately I haven't had the time to do anything fun...well the girls all went to Moncton shopping which was really fun. Next weekend i plan of having a great time with all my friends. You really begin to appriciate the friends you have after you have who you thought were life long friends stab you in the back but now I realize that that person who commented in a previous entry is as fake as people can be.
Jared When are you coming home? I miss you i didn't get a chance to see you last time you were home but now I hardly work.
Tracey, why do you hate us???? Where have you been...Kellie and I are coming to see you today whether your busy or not!!!!!
Jeff I hope you are having a good time out west tell everyone I said ""Hi""!!! are you come home for christmas?

Dylan surprise b-day party went well. He was so excited to see his best friend Mark but I think all the excitment wore him out cause he passed out at 11:00pm on his own birthday everyone tried to walk him but he was out for the count and of course I stayed up till the wee hours of the morning and Dylan was to kind he woke me up at 9:30 he got a full nights sleep and expected me to get up too...so I did to a house that was completely trashed!!

Then on Saturday Dylan and I got up early and headed to the beach for the day. I got a good tan and we had fun together then we came home. Friday night we had a few people over after we went to Alex's place( the boys were playing poker)Maria, Kim, and I had fun dancing around the apartment  listening to music and ofcourse having a few drinks to pass the time. Sunday I was so excited Jared came home for the weekend and we(kellie and me) went out for a drive in the mustang convertable they had rented and then we went out to the camp gound where they were staying. Jared I like Mike he seems fun and really sweet and like a really good person i can see why you like him so much. 
After Kellie and I got back from a visit with Jared Dylan and I wen to this cottage which was uneventful I may have gotten a little too drunk to be around his parents anyway but we spent most of our time out on the four wheeler. Monday we came home and went to moncton for supper which was good the came home and rented movies and went to bed.
Tomorrow I am having my wisdom teeth removed I'm scared! come see me Thursday I'll be home all day!

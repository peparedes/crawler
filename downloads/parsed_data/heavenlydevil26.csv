"event","Today was awesome.. School was all kindof a blur.. I dont remember much except hanging out with Lukas alot in art, <yer awesome by the way> Erika throwing water balloons at Mr. Polloquin, and Devin getting mad at me for not telling him something between me and Lukas.. Anyways.. After school, I hung out w/ Shawn and Anjel like the whole time.. Well.. First Anjel and I rode our bikes around town, and i fell like 50,000 times (scratching up my BRAND NEW $200 modem BMX bike)But its alright because I had a wicked awesome day.. Anyways as I was saying.. After we rode bikes, we went to Signal Street Store and bought a wicked lotta' chocolate.. We were wicked hyperrr, and then we saw Shawn (while spazzing out because of all the chocolate)  and he was like ""Jeeez! WTF is up with you guys!?"" it was wicked funny.. Then we went riding bikes (again but w/ Shawn this time) and we saw like.. a gagillion old people walking down the street.. It was madness.. Shawn called it the ""National Old People Day"" <hah.. After that, we all went back to Anjel's and played basketball in the backyard for like, ever, and i got to know Shawn a little bit more.. (wich now i know hes like.. the coolest..) Then at like 11:00(P.M that is) we were all in a bush (wich Anjel calls her ""hangout"") and saw this guy walking by, and Anjel was like ""Heyyy.. w'sup homey?"" and he walked by just saying hi.. Then he came back and was like ""Hey wait a second?!"" and we all ran out.. Then he was like stalking us, and spying on us in that bush, and Shawn threw a brick at him.. hahaha.. We call him ""The Bush Man"" now.. After Shawn went home, me and Anjel were on the computer laughing wicked hard at these giraffes online.. <dont ask why.. Anyways.. This is has been like.. The best day i've had in a longggg time.. Shawn and Lukas are both wicked awesome (now that ive gotten to know them better).. I have to hang out with them more often.. Well, this is enough excitement for one day.. See yal' later.. TaaTaa! *~Tianna~*"

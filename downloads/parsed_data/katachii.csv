"event","At friend's house; somewhere in far Queens, middle of nowhere.  One depressing room; not too depressing, but not too good.  Convex mirror, Super Mario picture.  Word that starts with H but shouldnt.
	Working at restaurant as new waiter- homeless people helpers.
	Other wing of building starts to collapse.  I make it out.  4 people still stuck in building.  Inside appears as a steep wintry slope.  One boy climbs out from depths of slope.  We throw a 'Wool Olney' blanket to one girl now in depths.  Can't pull her out.  Ask people for help pulling the wool olney, but no one helps me.  Finally she climbs out on her own, with the rest of them, and when she gets out she embraces me, saying ""I didnt think it was true what they said, but it is: I can love someone as much as I thought I would after meeting them.""

	Coming uptown, accidentally get off at 103.  Start walking uptown (to 116).  Jump onto roof of taxi- hanging onto antenna.  Taxi takes side route through park, goes up a long hill, starts accelerating.  The taxi starts going too fast for my comfort.  I jump off and slide to a stop, then continue running up hill.  Just then a man on a street luge comes up behind me; we go neck and neck up the hill.  It is getting dark, he has bright headlights, and is blasting music on his luge.  We get to the top of the hill, and continue over the peak, which suddenly narrows and becomes wavy as it goes downhill.  Surprised by curve, he loses it, flies off his luge.  Helmet flies off, he's in bushes.  I think he's dead, but he's okay."

- Failure to question social convention + their contentedness in doing so.
>What kind of teacher do you prefer?
- Intelligent, humble, patient.
>If you were a teacher, what would you propose?
- That I may be wrong.
>How would you grade your students?
- By one paper in which they form a theory and defend it.

>What is eternity? What is love? What is art? What is a symbol?
- That's a silly question; I don't know; anything; something that refers to a broader, non-verbal subject.
>What is religion? What is psychology?
- A method of organizing and categorizing the essence of metaphysical existence which totally misses the point; An attempt by humanity at emotional fulfillment.

>How do you know that you are happy, sad, nervous, bored?
- I don't think I ever know it, it just happens and I experience it.
>What does this school need? This room? You? This city? This country?
- Bigger dorm rooms, less law-school nerds; more space, less clutter; a forum, a community, a way to tell when I am being honest, a clear spiritual thought, more energy; more grime, less tourists, less dishonest hipsters, more earnest hipsters, better music, less coke, more acid; less weapons, more shame.

COLLISION
@ DUMBO, 16 Main St., Brooklyn, NY
""An interdisciplinary exhibition of student work and performance.  A wild dance party with open bar, DJs, bands, electronic beach balls, and cheerleaders on stilts.""

Party all night for $5
Take the A,C to High St., the F to York Sy., or the 1,2 to Clark St.

so I'm going to be playing some of my electronic works there, probably some time between 8 and 11. it should be a blast.  I dont know if there really is an open bar, but the flyer said so...

I am also bringing my noise assault to this dope show that's going to be at DUMBO in Brooklyn on the 17th.  There will be all sorts of artists and performers throwing down.  I will post the final info later.

I'd like to give a shout out to my Moms for giving me money so that my Diet Plan consists of healhty things once again (instead of crappy pizza and other cheap food)."

1/2 SUMMER SUBLET:
Does anyone want to sublet a room in Park Slope for $550 a month from mid-july through until the beginning of september?  I want to stay there for the first half of the summer while I take classes, and then move home to Providence to work and save money.  However, I need to find someone to sublet the room for the second half of the summer... By Thursday!!!  So hurry hurry and grab it up, it's a deal!  It is a really nice, spacious apartment, half a block from the Union St. N-train stop.  You'd be living with a few cool film students who are the nicest.  Email me at ned20@columbia.edu or send me a message at the screen name Katachii.  ASAP.  Word.

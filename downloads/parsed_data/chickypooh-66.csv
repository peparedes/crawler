"event","FIRST DEGREE

A married couple were asleep when the phone rang at 2 in the morning.
The wife (undoubtedly blonde), picked up the phone, listened a moment
and said, ""How should I know, that's 200 miles from here!"" and hung up.

The husband said, ""Who was that?""

The wife said, ""I don't know, some woman wanting to know if the coast is
clear.""


SECOND DEGREE

Two blondes are walking down the street. One notices a compact on
the sidewalk and leans down to pick it up. She opens it, looks in the
mirror and says, ""Hmm, this person looks familiar.""

The second blonde says, ""Here, let me see!""

So the first blonde hands her the compact.

The second one looks in the mirror and says, ""You dummy, it's me!""


THIRD DEGREE

A blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so she goes out and
buys a gun. She goes to his apartment unexpectedly and when she opens
the door she finds him in the arms of a redhead. Well, the blonde is
really angry. She opens her purse to take out the gun, and as she does so, she
is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head.

The boyfriend yells, ""No, honey, don't do it!!!""

The blonde replies, ""Shut up, you're next!""



FOURTH DEGREE

A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals.
She proudly says, ""Go ahead, ask me, I know all of them.""

A friend says, ""OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin?""

The blonde replies, ""Oh, that's easy: W.""



FIFTH DEGREE

What did the blonde ask her doctor when he told her she was pregnant?

""Is it mine?""


SIXTH DEGREE

Bambi, a blonde in her fourth year as a UCLA freshman, sat in her US
government class. ! The prof essor asked Bambi if she knew what Roe vs.
Wade was about.

Bambi pondered the question then finally said, ""That was the decision
George Washington had to make before he crossed the Delaware.""



SEVENTH DEGREE

Returning home from work, a blonde was shocked to find her house
ransacked and burglarized. She telephoned the police at once and reported the
crime.

The police dispatcher broadcast the call on the radio, and a K-9 unit,
patrolling nearby was the first to respond. As the K-9 officer approached
the house with his dog on a leash, the blonde ran out on the porch,
shuddered at the sight of the cop and his dog, then sat down on the
steps.

Putting her face in her hands, she moaned, ""I come home to find all my
possessions stolen. I call the police for help, and what do they do?

They send me a BLIND policeman."""

 This is so funny that it will boggle your mind.  And you will keep
trying it at least 50 more times to see if you can outsmart your foot.  But you can't!!! 
 
 
  1. While  sitting at your desk, lift your right foot off the floor   and make clockwise circles with it. 
 
 2. Now, while doing this, draw the number ""6"" in the air with   your right hand.  
 Your foot will change direction!!!
I told you so... And there is nothing you can do about it."

"event","OK...  so a co-worker and I had a ""falling out"" about a month and a half ago.  We had been friends for about 3 years.  We walked the breast cancer 3 day 3 years ago and I had considered her a ""good"" friend since then.  About mid year, we were put on the same project.  It has been a tough project due to a lot of bad communication from the project manager.  Anyway...  about two months ago, we were asked to give a demonstration to our managers and a select number of leads/co-workers of what we have accomplished so far.  Now, you need to understand that this is not what I do for a living at all...  I do not facilitate meetings, I know nothing of how to guide a meeting or how long it may take to do demonstrations, etc...  So, I scheduled a meeting for 2 hours.  My so called friend could not make it until 1/2 way through the meeting but we thought that would be OK because I would just go first.  Well, it took me 1 hour and 50 minutes to get through my presentation and that only left her 10 minutes.  I didn't think that was to big of a deal because hers area was completely new and didn't even have processes to go with it so there wasn't much she could talk about anyway.  She managed to get all of her information out in that 10 minutes but decided that she could no longer be friends with me since she could no longer trust me since I ""did this to her"".  My response was this, ""This is what you do for a living, not me.  Instead of your anger, I could have used some of your guidance in how I could have managed that better"".  My trust in her was completely gone as well...  I mean, who just takes away their friendship just because their friend did a poor job of running a meeting?  That is just LAME and I said so.  She still smiles and says hi and all I want to do is SCREAM at her!!  I cannot have parasites like that in my life!  I am way to open, loving and honest to have a such a person in my heart!  

So, here is my question....  Looks like she brought a Christmas present in for me.  I want to refuse it, give it back.  I don't like to live dishonestly and I would feel dishonest if I accepted it from her.  What should I do?"

"event","OK...  so my daughter is going on a field trip today where they have been asked to dress up.
My daughter had borrowed her good black velvet shoes to a girl friend so I called her last night to get the shoes back.  Her Mom told me that her daughter broke the shoes and she said she would pick my daughter up and take her shopping for a new pair of shoes.  I thought that was a great idea since I had committed to practicing with some of the band mates.  So.....   My daughter comes home with 3 inch heeled black boots!!  By the way...  My daughter is 9!  I told my daughter, ""Absolutely not""!  I called her Grandmother and asked her to take her out to Wal-Mart this morning and buy her some new shoes.  The other vocalist really liked the shoes and offered to buy them since they were her size.

Here is my question....  should I call and tell this Mother how incredibly inappropriate it is to allow a 9 year old buy 3 inch heeled shoes or should I let it go?  I really think that if she were to wear these shoes, she would hurt her self.  But above and beyond that, they look like CFM boots and what kind of Mom let's her 9 year old daughter wear that??"

Since I am now in my size 16, I decided to never look back and am giving away all on my 18 through 22's!  I have also decided that I don't want to pressure myself to get back into a size 10 again so I am only keeping sizes 12 to 16!  I will be sending a note out to my plus size gal pals to see if they want anything too.  I have a lot of nice work and some fun play things to choose from.  I have some ready to go when the Lupus, DAV or Vets call for pick-ups. I am still washing so there may be more at a later date as well.

"event","You know how I am wanting to study massage therapy...  Well, I would like to know what the difference is between ""now & then"".  

What I mean by that is...  When I give a massage now, it is by getting in tune or ""feeling"" the energy from the persons body I am touching and I let that guide me as far as where and how to touch them.  I believe that this is what makes me so good at it!  I fear that as I study the art, I will get more technical and start to stray away from the sensory.  I wonder if I could get some volunteers to let me do a before and after?  That would be cool...."

"event","Time passes.
        Life happens.
        Distance separates.
        Children grow up.
        Jobs come and go.
        Love waxes and wanes.
        Men don't call when they say they will.
        Hearts break.
        Parents die.
        Colleagues forget favors.
        Careers end.


        BUT...........
        Girlfriends are there, no matter how much time and how
        many miles are between you.
        A girlfriend is never farther away than needing her can
        reach.

        When you have to walk that lonesome valley and you have
        to walk it by yourself, your girlfriends will be on the valley's rim,
        cheering you on, praying for you, pulling for you, intervening on
        your behalf, and waiting with open arms at the valley's end.
        
        Sometimes, they will even break the rules and walk beside you.
        Or come in and carry you out.

        Girlfriends, daughters, daughter-in-laws, sisters, sisters-in-law,
        mother, mother-in-law, aunties, nieces, cousins, and extended family, 
        bless our life!

       The world wouldn't be the same without them, and neither would I.

       When we began this adventure called womanhood, we had no
       idea of the incredible joys or sorrows that lay ahead.

       Nor did we know how much we would need each other.
 
       Every day, we need each other still."

"event","So, I am on my to the car and Tate runs outside to give me a hug.  I love the fact that my kids are such warm and affectionate people!  Anyway, I get into my car and notice that I have a half full coffee cup from yesterdays commute.  I ask Tate as she is walking into the house if she would come back and take the cup into the house for me.  She is a morning person just like me so she pleasantly turned around to retrieve the cup.  As she turns towards the house, I blow her a kiss.  She takes the opportunity to turn back around to blow a kiss back my way and as she does, the coffee decides it wants back into the car too... and splashes all over my white shirt and khaki colored skirt!  OMG!!!  Well, I am already 10 minutes later then my usual start time so I try to stay calm and turn off the car.  I open the door and get out.  I look down and there is no recovering from this, I am totally covered in day old coffee!
I went in the house and started stripping...  I asked hubby to quickly wash them so they won't stain and I put on my jean jumper dress.  As I get ready to leave, I see my daughter in tears!  She feels SO bad for doing this....  Well, I quickly go to her, hug her and reassure her that I am not upset with her at all...  It was an accident!  She was being so sweet, I wouldn't want her to think that she did anything bad, it was all good.  So....  off I went...

So, I am now on 94, in the lane that gets you onto 694.  Lots of traffic in front of me, nothing behind me.  So this JERK in a Volvo decides to CUT ME OFF!!!  Well, this just pisses me off!  My window is down so I decide to give him a piece of my mind!  I am yelling obscenities like a construction worker!!  The guy just puts up his hand like it's a puppet and make the ""jabber-jabber"" movement!  URG.....  That pissed me off even more!!  So, I flipped him the bird!  Once we were on 694, I blew past him and flipped him off again.   Hmmmm......  I felt much better!

So....  I am hoping this is not an indication of the rest of my day!!"

I reach out to touch you and you fell apart

I never knew we were made of glass
Until it was to late and the dye was cast

The words you say in the heat of moment
Last forever in the heart of this woman

You try to take me down, just one more notch
Its not your heart you feel with, thats asking too much
(What I really wanted to say was:  Its not your heart you feel with, only your crotch)

You try to make your issues mine
Its never enough until you see me cry

The power is yours, I gladly gave it you 
Now you want total control, that I will NEVER do

I WILL recover, I am strong that way
But it will never happen until you GO AWAY!"

"event","Wow....  as I look at the calendar that I created for our summer activities, I realize that there isn't really any down time this summer!  I don't think that this has ever happened!  Maybe it's the kids' ages now.  They seem to be interested in so many things!  I think that the only thing I am NOT looking forward to is football camp in early August.  I never wanted ""B"" to get into football but everyone tells him that he is built for the sport.  Chuckles had a neighbor that played football in high school and with one ""bad tackle"" became a quadriplegic!  I have met him and he has made the best of his circumstances but still....  it scares me!

The 3 day is less than 2 weeks away!  I am really excited!  Pray for pleasant weather!  As you know I am not walking this year, I am part of the volunteer staff.  We have a lot of fun and energizing things planned to motivate the walkers.  The pit crew really helped us make it through last year, I am going to try to live up to their standards!  I have to be at the start location by 4:00 in the morning!!  Good thing I am a morning person!!

Well, I better get busy.....  I am at work!  LOL!

Take care all!  :-)"

RESIGNATION 
I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an adult. 
I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an 8 year-old  again. 

* I want to go to McDonald's and think that it's a four star restaurant.  
* I want to think M&Ms are better than money because you can eat them. 
* I want to lie under a big oak tree and play with my friends on a hot  summer's day. 
* I want to return to a time when life was simple; When all I knew were colors,
multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes,  and it didn't bother me,
because I didn't know what I didn't know and I didn't care. 

* All I knew was to be happy  because I was blissfully unaware of all the things that should make me worry or upset. 
* I want to think the world is fair.
* That everyone is honest and good. 
* I want to believe that anything is possible. I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again. 
* I want to live simply again. I don't want my day to consist of
computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones. 
* I want to believe in the power of smiles,  hugs, a kind word, truth,
justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels  in the snow. 

So . . . here's my check book and my car-keys, my credit card bills and my mobile phone. I am officially resigning from adulthood.  And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first, cause... I am off to the playground!!!"

"event","At this time of year, I want to thank all of you who have taken the time
and trouble to send me your chain letters over the past 12 months.

Thank you for making me feel safe, secure, blessed, and wealthy.

Because of your concern I no longer drink Coca Cola because it can
remove toilet stains.

I no longer drink Pepsi or Dr Pepper since the people who make these
products are atheists who refuse to put ""Under God"" on their cans.

I no longer drink anything out of a can because I will get sick from the
rat feces and urine that could be on the can.

I no longer use Saran wrap in the microwave because it causes cancer.

I no longer check the coin return on pay phones because I could be
pricked with a needle infected with AIDS.

I no longer use cancer-causing deodorants even though I smell like a
water buffalo on a hot day.

I no longer go to shopping malls because someone will drug me with a
perfume sample and rob me.

I no longer receive packages from UPS or FedEx since they are actually
Al Qaeda in disguise.

I no longer shop at Target since they are French and don't support our
American troops or the Salvation Army.

I no longer answer the phone because someone will ask me to dial a
number for which I will get a phone bill with calls to Jamaica, Uganda,
Singapore and Uzbekistan.

I no longer have any sneakers - but that will change once I receive my
free replacement pair from Nike.

I no longer buy expensive cookies from Neiman Marcus since I now have
their recipe.

I no longer worry about my soul because I have 363,214 angels looking
out for me and St Theresa's novena has granted my every wish.

Thanks to you, I have learned that God only answers my prayers if I
forward an e-mail to seven of my friends and make a wish within five
minutes.
I don't remember seeing that in the Bible anywhere.)

I no longer have any savings because I gave it to a sick girl who is
about to die in the hospital (for the 1,287,954th time).

I no longer have any money at all, but that will change once I receive
the $15,000 that Microsoft and AOL are sending me for participating in 
their special e-mail program.

Yes, I want to thank all of you soooooooo much for looking out for me
that I will now return the favor!

If you don't send this e-mail to at least 144,000 people in the next 70
minutes, a large dove with diarrhea will land on your head at 5:00 PM 
(EST)this afternoon and the fleas from 12 camels will infest your back, 
causing you to grow a hairy hump. I know this will occur because it actually happened to a friend of my next door neighbor's ex-mother-in-law's second husband's cousin's beautician!"

We decided that we should send out a message to our co-workers (we work for rival companies) saying that the other company put out a challenge...  The following is a paragraph out of the note I sent:

**** The lead female vocalist (Kris) is from American Express and last night at practice, she threw out a challenge to all of us here at Thrivent.
She said that she was going to send out an invite to her American Express co-workers and let them know that they have challenged us to a friendly ""Support your co-worker"" contest.  When you say ""contest"", there is usually a prize but I don't think we had thought that far......  we are open to suggestions!  ;-)****

"event","Just to gain some perspective, six married men will be dropped on an island with one car and 4 kids each for six weeks. 

Each kid will play two sports and either take music or dance classes. 
There is no fast food.  Each man must take care of his 4 kids; keep his assigned house clean, correct all homework, complete science projects, cook, do laundry, and pay a list of ""pretend"" bills with not enough money. In addition.. each man will have to budget in money for groceries each week. 

Each man must also take each child to a doctor's appointment, a dentist 
appointment, and an appointment for a haircut. He must also make 
cookies or cupcakes for a social function. 

Each man will be responsible for decorating his own assigned house, 
planting flowers outside and keep it presentable at all times. 
The men will only have access to television when the kids are asleep 
and all chores are done. 

There is only one TV between them. (This will surely do half of them in!)  ;-) 

Each father will be required to know all of the words to every stupid 
song that comes on TV and the name of each and every repulsive character 
on cartoons. 

The men must shave their legs, wear makeup daily, which they will apply 
themselves either while driving or making four lunches. They must adorn themselves with jewelry, wear uncomfortable yet stylish shoes, keep their nails polished and eyebrows groomed. 

During one of the six weeks, they will have to endure severe stomach 
cramps, back aches, and have extreme, unexplained mood swings but never 
once complain or slow down from other duties. 

They must attend weekly PTA meetings, church, and find time at least 
once to spend the afternoon at the park or a similar setting. 
He will need to pray with the children each night, bathe them, dress 
them, brush their teeth and comb their hair each morning by 7:00. 

A test will be given at the end of the six weeks, and each father will 
be required to know all of the following information: 
*each child's birthday, height, weight, shoe size, clothes size and 
doctor's name. Also the child's weight at birth, length, time of birth, 
and length of labor.  *each child's favorite color, middle name, favorite snack, favorite song, favorite drink, favorite toy, biggest fear and what they want to be when they grow up.  They must clean up after their sick children at 3:00 a.m. and then spend the remainder of the day tending to that child and waiting on them hand and foot until they are better. 

Each man will have to make an Indian hut model with six toothpicks, a 
tortilla and one marker; and get a 4 year old to eat a serving of peas. 
The kids vote them off the island based on performance. 

The last man wins only if...he still has enough energy to be intimate 
with his spouse at a moment's notice.. 

If the last man does win, he can play the game over and over and over 
again for the next 18-25 years...eventually earning the right to be 
called Mother!"

"event","<p>I've been rather quiet lately. Biology is proving itself harder than I'd expected, but I'm really shooting for decent grades this year, so I've been doing a lot of studying. I'd like to leave this place on good terms.</p>

Apparently, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ali_blaire"">Ali</a> and the gang have ditched me to visit <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/angelicwarren"">Mr. Worthington's</a> penthouse and go shopping in the city with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/redd_phoenixx"">Ms. Grey</a> and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/scotty_one_eyes"">Mr. Summers</a>. Those two are finally getting married, and it's about time. I always see them together. It seems like the only time that they're not together is when they're in class. At first, I thought they were just happy to be together after what happened to Jean at Alkali Lake. Now I see that it goes beyond that, and that the love between them has been blossoming for years. How do I know all of this? Did I mention that I'm a good spy? I can escape the scene more quickly than most, though I'll have to see just how I fare against someone like <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/backinaflash"">Pietro</a>. It'd be an interesting race."

"event","<p>Is it just me, or is the new Business teacher totally hot? I could suffer through years of marketing and finance with him teaching. I promise, it's not just the angel wings. I haven't written much lately. My life's been too productive to write. I know that sounds arrogant, but it's true. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ali_blaire"">Ali</a> and I have become first-class shopaholics.</p>

<p>P.S. I know who she has a crush on! *nyah*"

"event","<p>Living here is becoming a harder task every day. In Quebec, I subsisted on an entirely different schedule. Now I have classes and training sessions to attend, and while all of this keeps me busy during the day, the evening curfew does nothing to enhance my health. Apparently, my ravenous appetite and almost complete lack of sleep have alarmed a few of the teachers.</p>

<p>The Professor called me to his office yesterday and, as much as I would've liked to skip his invitation (though it was really more a request), I assented. They performed a few tests on me, including a full-body scan that left me feeling rather disoriented afterward. They sent me away for afternoon training, and I didn't hear from the Professor again until this morning.</p>

<p>He explained that, due to my gift of speed, I also have an extreme metabolic acceleration. This has its advantages, but it also puts me in a rather weak position. My heart rate can get upwards of 200 beats per minute, and though my body is designed to handle it, a simple blow to the chest, the right placement, the right time...and I could die. I wasn't exactly prepared for such a morbid prognosis, but it helped to explain why I'm constantly on the go...why I'm always hungry...why I never sleep. Professor Xavier advised me to eat six meals a day (I feel like I've been given a diet counselor), and he stressed the importance of an early breakfast. Apparently, my stomach fills with acid every evening while I'm asleep. I need to eat within half an hour of waking up, or risk developing ulcers, which could eventually scar and grow cancerous. He also advised that I occupy myself well into the night, and has given me permission to use the Danger Room past curfew. Obviously, any sequence I employ must be an easy one; otherwise he'll know that I've been straining myself, and call off the deal. I don't know why, but something in Xavier's tone has made me determined not to screw this up.</p>

<p>I am sorely in need of a shopping spree with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ali_blaire/"">Ali</a>. Maybe I can fly us out to the city sometime soon without anyone noticing."

"event","<p>I had another dream about that girl. She is young - perhaps four years old - yet I cannot help but notice her striking resemblance to myself. She has my ears, my hair, my eyes. I feel very close to her, but the nature our relationship, I cannot tell. Do I have a sister? My expectations are probably too high, but I may eventually ask Professor Xavier to read my mind. Or maybe...perhaps I could find someone else to do it if he will not. This girl may only be a fragment of my dreams, but she feels much more genuine. I <i>must</i> know who she is."

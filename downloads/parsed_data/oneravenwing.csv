"event","The bastard showed up.  I tried to keep him from coming in, but he whined and whined until I did.  I did my best to entertain him while keeping him away from poor Lou.  A film distracted him.  The dancing king of goblins seemed to amuse him somehow. 

But then he had to go and get me <i>drunk</i>.  The ass never did forget my weakness.  I'm glad I sent Lou off; that would have been mortifying.  

Fucking pomegranate juice."

"event","Halloween is approaching.  It's an interesting holiday around here; it gives some people like me and Lou a chance to go out a bit further into daylight.  But usually it's at night that anything interesting happens.  Lou should be fine; we won't have a moon that night at all.  I'm hoping we can do something... <i>fun</i> for once.  Poor Lou's had nothing interesting to do since she found me.

I'm a little concerned, however.  I believe Sange has discovered where we live.  That could be all manner of difficult.  I'm hoping he knows better than to disturb me.  But I can't think of when he ever knew better than <i>anything</i>...

I believe I'm going to go and have something to eat now."

"event","Still alive.  Just damn busy.  Working with training Lou.  Each month is a bit better.  

No update on that ""date"" of mine?  Too fucking bad.  I don't feel like talking about it.

Maybe later, I dunno."

"event","I may very well have lost my mind.  Then again, I may be so tired of sitting around and doing nothing that I'm just setting myself up for a night of insanity for the hell of it.  Oh well.  Regardless, I'm sure it'll be interesting.

I'm going to some club or another with Sange. I haven't actually seen him in about a hundred years, so it'll be interesting to see him to say the least.  I'm curious to see if he's changed at all.  I highly doubt it.

Lou is far too excited about this.  The idea of my going on a ""date"" has woken up something of the actual teenage girl in her and she's been bustling around all day to ""get me ready"".  She hauled me to some shopping area to find new clothes for me, as all I've had for a while is the ratty old prisoner gown I got from the prison.  My account from the old FMB system is still active, amazingly, and since I haven't touched it in so long I've got a good amount left over.  I bought some basic stuff - new fishnets too.  Love fishnets.  That's right.  And Lou insisted on makeup and nail polish, which I've never used, but she's adamant on my using it tonight.  She wants me to get dressed up, I know... She's having too much fun with it.  I think she likes having something ""normal"" for her to prepare for.  Except this night is going to be anything <i>but</i> normal.  Oh well.  I do miss dancing...

Lou's excitement is a tad contagious, so I'll bore you all with what I'm going to be wearing.  We found an eggplant colored halter top of an interesting cut, some black slacks, and shoes.  Yes, I'll actually be wearing shoes.  (I never wear shoes - I hate not being able to feel what I'm connected to.)  They're flats, however.  I can't handle major heels.  Besides, if I show up any taller than I already am, Sange'll have some kind of fit, I'm sure.  As for the slacks, we had to adapt them a bit.  There was nowhere for my tail to get through.  

I almost wish Lou could come, since she's having so much fun with the idea, but I don't want her exposed to Sange's lot until she's a bit more prepared.  I think this sort of club might be too much for her, anyways - she'll be recognized for what she is there and might be approached by people she's not ready to socialize with yet.  I'll make it up to her.  I'll bring ice cream back with me.  She likes ice cream.

Expect an odd report of some sort to follow soon.  Until then, I'm off to apply this sparkly nonsense to my claws..."

"event","Lou is asleep again - that's her name; Lou.  She was only awake for a bit today - enough to eat and clean up her wounds.  She was quite a mess but seemed much more relaxed than she did last night.  Poor thing.  I've always felt bad for werewolves.  (Not vampires.  I did once; not so much anymore.)  She cries in her sleep, too.  I don't say anything, though.

The moon's just past full, bringing relief to a lot of us.  I'm sitting at the window just watching it.  Fresh air really is lovely.  It's been a while.

I'm so tired, and I'm not sure why.  It's not like rest was something I've been lacking.  It's probably that it's been so long since I've done anything physically taxing and the other night was a bit much.  (Don't you go getting ideas; it was running and a bit of flying, that's all.)  It's so nice sitting here seeing the sky for once and feeling a breeze.  Makes me remember things.  Things that make me feel so stuck...

I wonder how things will be changing from now on..."

"event","So, I finally got this thing working.  Only to find a certain low-life had his own.  I've decided to watch him - maybe I can help out that poor boy the monster's set his sights on.  If not, so it goes.  It's what you get for getting involved in Sange's sort.

It's interesting being home.  I was glad they'd kept the place for me.  Not as if I hadn't done the landlady a share of favors she owed me.  We're even now - the place was even dusted.  And I think I like having company here - The little werewolf is asleep in the spare room.  She's had a rough night.  Really.  I've never thought of myself as social, but there's something about this girl... I guess it's a kindrancy of a sort?  I couldn't say.  Twenty years does leave your brain a bit foggy. Particularly when you were only awake for about twenty days of it.  (Sleep really does help jail time go by.)  

I don't think I have much else to say.  I should probably go and find food.  I don't necessarily need to eat, but the girl is still a mortal creature.  I wonder what people eat for breakfast these days..."

Not sure why I'm doing this, though.  Oh well.

Testing, one two... yeah."

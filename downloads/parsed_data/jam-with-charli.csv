"event","<font size=""1"">Well, I'm proud to say that I survived my first week of classes.&nbsp; They're going really well, better than I had even hoped.&nbsp; And I made biscuits in cooking class!&nbsp; And they even tasted good!<br /><br />..Okay, maybe Seth made biscuits and I watched and I put them in the oven and he made sure I didn't let them burn.&nbsp; But still!&nbsp; I was a part of that process!&nbsp; I've come to terms with the fact I'm never going to be a chef, and that's alright with me.&nbsp; I'm just glad I get to have a class with my boy.&nbsp; I'll spare you the mushy crap.&nbsp; <strike>Having time to spend with him at is great.&nbsp; We had a fight.&nbsp; Over Marty of all things, surprise surprise.&nbsp; I had every right to freak out, after she pretty much told me the two of them had screwed around that one time he got drunk, then called me less than an hour later and told me she thought she had an STD?&nbsp; What would any normal person do in that situation?&nbsp; Seth got angry.&nbsp; Says I need to learn to trust him.&nbsp; Well dammit, I'm trying.</strike><br /><br />I went in for that coffeehouse audition I mentioned in my last post, and they seemed to like me alright.&nbsp; The list of who's performing gets posted tomorrow.&nbsp; I'm excited/nervous.&nbsp; It's been ages since I've done this sort of thing, you know?&nbsp; Like, since my Lakehurst days.&nbsp; The only person who's heard me perform lately is Seth, and he has to say I'm good, it's in our friendship contract. ;)<br /><br />I have my first quiz today in Woman's Psych today, so I'm going to go cram.&nbsp; Those UoT teachers do <i>not</i> wait to spring the assignments.</font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">Finally heard from Marty a few days ago.&nbsp; She's moved into her own apartment and everything, and I couldn't be happier for her.&nbsp; With work and everything, I've hardly had any time to spend with her lately, but I'm glad we're on alright terms again.&nbsp; We'll have to go out for coffee or something later this week, okay?&nbsp; <strike>Am I still worried about her spending so much time with Seth?&nbsp; Of course I am.&nbsp; But I trust him completely.&nbsp; I know nothing's going on.&nbsp; And besides, she's got her own boyfriend now, and she seems really into him.&nbsp; She might be.. well, <i>flirty</i>, I guess, but she's not a cheater.&nbsp; Right?<br /></strike><br />Classes started again at UoT yesterday and surprisingly enough, I'm actually sort of glad to be back.&nbsp; My teacher for my Womens Psychology 2 class remembers me from a few semesters ago, and she told me she was glad I decided to continue with her course.&nbsp; I was totally flattered.&nbsp; The rest of my classes seem at least tolerable if not great.&nbsp; Plus, Seth talked me into signing up for this ridiculous baking class with him as an elective -&nbsp; as if I weren't a lost cause when it comes to anything involving an oven, right?&nbsp; Anyway, we had our first session this morning and it was pretty neat.&nbsp; Seth was bummed that they didn't bust out the big white hats right away, but we did get aprons.&nbsp; I'm thinking about decorating mine.&nbsp; Maybe with puff paint.<br /><br />There's some coffeehouse gig coming up in a couple weeks at the university, and auditions are this Friday.&nbsp; I think I might give it a shot, it's been awhile since I've really laid down something good on the piano.&nbsp; Wish me luck!</font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">It's been a really hectic past few weeks, and definitely not by any choice of mine.&nbsp; Between the holidays and some.. unanticipated social drama, I've barely had time to breathe, much less write in this thing.<br /><br />Christmas was fun, I'd missed my family (though upon spending two hours in a head-to-head game of Extreme Monopoly with them, I did have to ask myself why) but the nicest part was coming home to Seth.&nbsp; Actually, not only Seth.&nbsp; We had a temporary guest.&nbsp; <i>Very</i> temporary, really.&nbsp; Marty came and stayed with us for a few days, but then found another place to stay and headed off there.&nbsp; <strike>That girl is a time bomb.&nbsp; She tried to convince Seth I was sleeping around behind his back.&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; Super-virgin.&nbsp; Cheating.&nbsp; As if I would ever.&nbsp; I barely even<i> know</i> anyone else in this area outside of the university, much less well enough to just hop in the sack with them.&nbsp; That hurt.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; And the reason she did it?&nbsp; To try and get into his pants.&nbsp; It's just so.. ugh.&nbsp; I don't even understand what must be going through her head.</strike>&nbsp; She came back last night, actually, but we had a little disagreement and she took off again.&nbsp; <strike>She got mad because I didn't trust her.&nbsp; Well what sane person would?!&nbsp; I am <i>not</i> a mean person.&nbsp; I'm big on second chances.&nbsp; Even third chances most of the time.&nbsp; But I am so sick of being taken advantage of.</strike><br /><br />The temp job at the tree farm is over for the season, so I'm back to working the normal multiplex/grocery store/pizza girl circuit.&nbsp; Throw full-time girlfriend in there, and I don't think I'm going to be getting bored anytime soon. :)&nbsp; But I do have some extra spare time before the semester starts, so if anyone wants to get together and hang out, just let me know.<br /><br /><strike>I should probably go try to find Marty.</strike></font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">Came to a compromise with my mom.&nbsp; I'll be heading over to stay with my family for the weekend, but I'm coming back Monday afternoon for Christmas with Seth.&nbsp; We finally got the lights and the tree up, it really feels like the holidays are here now.&nbsp; I could go for some snow.&nbsp; As long as it's going to be this cold, I think we deserve some.<br /><br /><strike>Seth told me he loved me a couple days ago.&nbsp; I feel like I'm on a cloud.&nbsp; Who needs presents when you're as happy as I am?</strike><br /><br />I tried baking some cookies today.&nbsp; Let's not talk about it. ;)<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">Nothing quite puts the damper on holiday spirit like taking up a temp job at a tree farm.&nbsp; People coming in only a little more than a wee before Christmas and freaking out because we don't have what they're looking for.&nbsp; Everyone from little boys whining at their daddies to annoyed fiancees whining at their soon to be husbands.&nbsp; </font><font size=""1"">Nothing's big enough, tall enough, green enough.&nbsp; </font><font size=""1"">But yeah, the pay's spectacular, and the people there are great.&nbsp; Only downside other than the customers is the constant risk of hypothermia and eh, I've got lots of mittens.&nbsp; <strike>And this way I'll be able to get Seth something really great for Christmas.&nbsp; All I need to do is figure out <b>what</b>.</strike>&nbsp; Mom's been calling, she wants me to come home for the holiday, do things the traditional Delaney Familia way - Christmas Eve services at the church, presents in the morning, big dinner in the evening, my three kid brothers running around like they're on crack the whole time.&nbsp; How intriguing, right?<br /><br />In terms of good news - I am <i>so</i> done with school until January.&nbsp; I've spent the past few days just kicking back and relaxing.&nbsp; I'm thinking about making some cookies.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; I'll have to check to make sure the new fire extinguisher works before I do.<br /><br />If there's anyone who'd like to.. I don't know, hang out or something, I'm game.<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">My last final is this Thursday, then I'm done for the semester.&nbsp; It's a good thing, too, because things are getting so crazy at work (plural) that I'm pretty sure if I was asked to write another essay on gender roles, my head would blow up.&nbsp; Plain and simple.&nbsp; I just had to go pick the oddest freaking major in the universe, didn't I?<br /><br />On the plus side, it's 20 days until Christmas.&nbsp; I've got the boxes out and I'm going to start decorating tonight, whether Seth helps me or not.<br /><br /><strike>It's sort of weird, hearing about all of the people he's meeting.&nbsp; I mean, I know I'm probably just worried because of the whole Paige fiasco, but I'm also starting to feel like maybe I'm just boring.&nbsp; Maybe he'd<i> rather</i> have a girl who likes to party.&nbsp; I just feel so out of place when I go out to these big functions.&nbsp; It's not me.&nbsp; I'm a homebody, I like sitting on the couch and playing scrabble and the fact that maybe that's weird doesn't really phase me.&nbsp; But I can't spend the rest of my life with him being the only real friend I've got to depend on.&nbsp; And more importantly, he probably won't stick around for long if I try to.</strike><br /><br />I ended up at a strip club last night.&nbsp; No, I don't want to talk about it.&nbsp; It was.. weird.&nbsp;  I'm never letting Seth take ""restaurant advice"" from his school friends ever again.&nbsp; Freud would have had a field day analyzing that place - just being there was like watching the decline of modern society.&nbsp; I mean, do teenagers do anything <i>other</i> than getting drunk and having sex these days?&nbsp; Did I miss an important memo?<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">Hey, happy day.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are two full days left until December.&nbsp; I'm counting because the roomie has made me promise to wait until then to pull out the Christmas decorations.&nbsp; They're sitting in the closet now all lonely and I just want to take them out and I want to get a Christmas tree and a wreath and AHH Christmas yes.&nbsp; Holidays rock.<br /><br />I would also like to proudly announce that I made grilled cheese sandwiches this afternoon without killing anyone, or even creating any smoke.&nbsp; I got to all my classes on time.&nbsp; My hair is curling right.&nbsp; I got promoted to projectionist at the multiplex, which came along with a pretty reasonable pay raise.&nbsp; The air freshener I bought for Seth's room is working, so our apartment doesn't smell like his feet anymore.&nbsp; That's probably the best part.<br /><br />I have no idea what I did right, but I must have built up some SERIOUS good karma.</font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">There.&nbsp; At least I've started.<br /><br />This morning I tried to make pancakes for my roommate and myself - what an <b>awful</b> idea.&nbsp; The entire apartment filled up with smoke, I'm surprised the fire alarms didn't go off.&nbsp; Just as well that they didn't, though.&nbsp; Between the experience itself and the grief Seth's giving me for it, I'm pretty much embarrassed enough to last the next lifetime or so.&nbsp; To the end of the week, at least.&nbsp; I'm going to let <i>him</i> cook breakfast from now on, and I'll stick to heating up TV dinners, ordering Chinese food, and making the world's best bolagna sandwiches.<br /><br />I'm Charli Delaney, and I'm no one's chef.<br /><br />I <i>am</i>, however, 20 years old; and a Women &amp; Gender Studies major/Music Performance minor in my sophomore year at the University of Toronto.&nbsp; I've lived in the area all my life, spent the majority of my formative years at Lakehurst high school, and count my graduation day among my life's top moments.&nbsp; Two years later, chances are you've seen me around; delivering your pizza, taking your ticket at the local multiplex, wrapping your gifts in the mall at Christmas, performing with my band at your aunt's wedding reception, maybe even busting you and your fake ID at the grocery store when you were trying to buy beer?&nbsp; I refuse to apologize for that, by the way.&nbsp; You're destroying your innards before their due time.<br /><br />Point there is, I guess I work a lot.&nbsp; I like being able to pay for the heat.&nbsp; Sethy always tells me I have ""job schizophrenia"", the way I jump jobs so much, but he is retarded and naturally would say such dumb things.&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, he's honestly not that bad.&nbsp; He's actually pretty great as far as roommates go.&nbsp; Known him since Lakehurst, which at 20 is 35% of my life, and pretty damn impressive.&nbsp; I couldn't ask for better.&nbsp; Or, well.. I probably <i>could</i>.&nbsp; I just wouldn't get anyone - with an apartment of limited quality you can only get so much.&nbsp; Kidding again.&nbsp; Maybe.<br /></font>"

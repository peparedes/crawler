HAPPY HALLMARK DAY!
Have a good time whatever you are doing. if you have a partner- i may not want to know the details.....

Look at the time- i'm on campus! Ain't i good?! I have to go and see a woman from the Woman's Studies Department about possiblity doing an MA next year, then work my arse off for the rest of the day (and year!) in a vain attempt to get a 2:1...

<b>Editi:</b> Just realised some smart-arsed git is bound to post and say that the canonization of St Valentine may have preceeded the creation of this particular multi-national company, but meeeh! that's what i say to you! 
Hehehehe as i was writing this my friend Rowan sent me a card:

""when you care enough to send the very best"". Hahahaha. Rowan loves me though! Yay! I'm sure her boyfriend is well jealous of my dancing cats."

<br>
<br>
Oh well. I do have quite a lot to say. Probably none of it at all
interesting to any one else. But i guess that hasn't stopped me int'
past. But.... i shall restrain myself from such idle discourse. Maybe
another day.
<br>
<br>
However, i will say one thing which brought me much myrth. teeehhee.
hehe. I got an email from a (reasonably well-known as further research
has informed me) journalist from the Mail on Sunday [1], in responce to
my appeal i had put on the York Alumni website
( http://www.york.ac.uk/admin/dao/alumni/events.htm -see bottom). He
told me all about his radical Marxist activities of the early 70s etc
etc and i found an article about him on the web that says he once said
to his lecturer ""Sorry I'm late, i was starting the reveloution"". Now
he backs the death penalty and according to one site is a ""moral
Conservative"". hahahahaha. My favourite bit of all, especially as he
hadn't mentioned his Toryfication, and there was all this Trot-talk and
his (then) views, especially about Trade Unionism and other
revelutionary politics, at the bottom you get the disclaimer ""The views
expressed in the email may not reflect the opinions of the Mail on Sunday or
associated newspapers"".
hhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!! <br>
<br>
Well it amused me anyway........

Bonne Nuit tout la monde! Bed time! (boing!)  


<br>
<br>
[1] for my non-British readers, or those with better things to do with
their time than mock/be amused by newspapers, the Mail is a right-wing
tabloid, with views that would be almost comedic if they were not possessed by real people!"

i mainly want to say that NEXT WEEK I AM 21 BUT LAST YEAR I WAS 18!!! How weird is that?!

Also- Bebby! Merci bien for my present! It was very thoughtful! Haven't had a chance to listen to the CD yet (but sure it will be good and it impressed my gran!)started the Threepenny Novel (many yays!)- i can justify reading it as it kind of fits in with my course (and smells so good!) *ahem* and yay- we must make the Harry Potter Muffins together!

Went out with my friend Alex last night! hehehe *squeee* he gave me a Beckett play in French! Hehehe! It was one i had read too so i felt extra poncy and good owning it! he lives 1/2 a mile away from Sir Samual's grave and said he had gone to it to try and get some mud from it to rub on my book but it was shut! haha. I informed him it was a lovely thought nonetheless. 

Anyway- can't be arsed to say anymore. Byeeeeeeeeeeeee"

Also- the other bit of my game- to end as cheesily as i can- was also achived. how is this for cheese?:

<i>. Hopefully then, we would have a more egalitarian society, in which male and female would not be viewed as dichotomous groups to each other, and homogeneous in themselves, but recognise children as individuals. </i>

it was was it always is- a poorly written feminist rant, with some references thrown in. and this time with a small parenting rant about gender stereotyping at the end! how odd!

"event","I am in my essay writing computer room in which i have spent many nights, but next to my usual computer as it is broken, so no wall to lean against! 
Hopefully it won't take all night though as is a 1000-1500 word essay and i am going to use A LOT of quotes! Also- not assessed so i am not going to get too wound up. (hahaha-yeah right).

So far i have written the grand total of 0, thats, 0 words. But i have opened a word document which i decided warrented a visit to the vending machine as the sanitary towel wrapper told me to! 
[honestly it did! it also informed me ""you only have 400 periods in your life it just seems like a lot more"" and ""you have a better memory whilst on your period"" which means that if you are ""on the rag"" (haha) whilst doing an exam you are either very fortunate or fucking unlucky. Anyway, instead of dismissing the irritating, smug remarks of my feminine hygene products, i have decided to adere when it comes up with little gems such as ""you may find regular snacks will help your concentration and energy levels whilst you are having your period- so go on- treat yourself!"". So i did.] btw don't you think tampons and towles should be provided by the state? they are so darned expensive! and condoms and the pill are free from certain places and periods are the result of using those, kind of, so they should concider the consequences of their population-controling actions! and also...just...because! They would if men menstruated!

Anway- that was a bit of an aside-rant. Back to essay. When i have written the intro i am allowed t' go t' Heslington t' look for a Grauniad (SU shop shut!). Or even go to...THE LIBRARY! Gasp!

Will update in a couple of hours and say what's what. (7 maybe)

[Also- Alex- how do i get Jabber on Trillian so i can talk to you?]"

""Teachers"" scares me. Makes me want to be a teacher *shudder* aaah well it is bound to happen one day i need to accept it!
When moved laptop found deoterant had been seaerching for for a fortnight! Just when i had bought another and all! (just to make sure you know- i have been using deorterant for the past 2 weeks, but my emergancy one that makes me sweat and therefore negates the use of deoderant. i'm sure you wanted to know that!)
Anyway- i feel a bit better today, but Rowan says i am not allowed to do my essay until tomorrow. And i am scared of her. But feeling guilty for not working!! But i guess if i work sundaymondaytuesdaywednesdaymorning it shou
ld be ok?

oooh here is a totally embarrassing thing that happened o me the ther week i forgot to tell you about:

*Anna receives email from college porter to say she has large letter at college address*

Anna and Mary go to Halifax Colege (halls/dorms/whatever) to collect it.

<b>Anna:</b> hello you have a letter for me?
<b>Porter:</b>  yes 
<i>ticks Anna's name off list and goes into office
emerges, hands parcle to Anna whilst giving her a very strange look </i>
<b>Porter:</b>  sign here please <i>whilst still looking sideways</i>
<b>Anna:</b>  ok <i>signs</i> i wonder what it can be
<i>turns  letter over so that the large, unmissbale words ""BIG SEX PICTURE INSIDE"" are displayed</i>
<b>Anna:</b>  ....eeerrrrrmmm
<i>Porter and Mary look at Anna</i>
<b>Anna:</b>  well....
<i>Anna suddenly remebers going to a talk about sex education in the US and how terrible it is and expoitive to women, and nsafe, and spreading STDs by their studpid STUPID abstineance only tecnique which is stupid STUPID! and then signing up to their activist mailing list</i>
<b>Anna:</b>  It's not porn!
<i>realises this makes it look like porn</i>
<b>Anna:</b> no it really isn't porn!
<i>porter looks unconvinced and goes back into his office</i>
<b>Anna:</b> honestly!
<i> Anna then proceedes to tell Mary in very load voice about the real contents of the package, bt gives up."

...spent the day malingering in bed- reading and sleeping and listening to the radio and watching TV. I hardly ever get ill.

Oh- i got an extention for my essay though- now due in on the 22nd instead! phew... i hope i get it done- still worried that i won't. 

need to squee about having lovely lovely friends:
-when i was feeling lonely at 3am i texted Myf as it was her daytime and she texted back and it cheered me up alot! thank you *hugs*

- I got a Christmas card from Bee today which made me really happy!!! It was so so sweet! *squish*

-Rowan came round and brought me a DVD to watch (Teachers! one of my favourite programmes!) and weas really thoughtful and brought me a drink and some pears and some throat sweets too. Ah!

-Mary and CAtherine and Shiv all texted me too. How lovely!

Last night was a disaster. We had big techical problems and couldn't show the video- for the second time in a row! And this time we didn't have a speaker as well to save the day. They did all eat my crisps and biscuits that i provided though. 30 people turned up! i was so happy as i thought there would be about 3! But then everything went wrong. tried to get another room, and couldn't. Tried changing videos, phoning people, the JCRC Char etc etc could help. I was running about, but apperently Hugo was very smug. He probably came to try and ruin it anyway. I was really upset about it all. But it was not just the video. it was kind of the last thing on top of all the things upsetting me at the moment as i am feeling quite down. i am a camel. broken back etc etc. CAtherine was really nice though and i had myself mainly sorted out by the time the others caught up. I feel so terrible. 2 events in a row haven't cocked up when it hasn't been me being chair. people kept saying it wsn't my fault but i still feel responsable. you put all your energy into something and pfffft...

Might have an anti-racsim week next term though. But mehmeheh. *sigh* i just feel quite shite today now. not quite sure what to do with myself. probably some uni work would be a good idea- been running about to and from liberation week stuff and refugee meetings etc. Going to the LGB's video tonight. so will work before then. didn't go to Access' event on monday- feel slightly bad! 

I also feel terrible as i told Shiv that i would get tickets for her to go to a play on sunday and felt weird and couldn't make myself leave the house and i now i have let her down. I texted her housemate who is involved with it and she said if i get the money to her she could get them for me tonight. But what if they are sold out?

just.....Arse!"

yes so student union elections on campus today- i'm standing for women's commitee. Nervous. I don't think there is much competition as far as know, but still scared shitless. I hate standing for election. 

Also- Unity (unite against fascism) event tonight. Video showing. Am very very nervous because technology hates me. Drempt last night that i showed the wrong film and lots of old women laughed at me. Hmmmmppph. Showing ""Youn Nazi and Proud"" along with the other video i tried to show a few weeks ago and fucked up. I have to go to campus in a minute to by copius amounts os crisps and biscuits as i have bribed the ever-hungry student population to come with promise of free junk food."

"event","Went to a political meeting tonight with Lindsey German (convenor of
stop the war coalition) and Azmat Begg, father of Moazzam Begg, A
Briton&nbsp; who is currently being held at Guantamino Bay, without
charge or trial. A story about it is here:&nbsp;
http://www.f-t-a.freeserve.co.uk/potm/2003/apr.htm&nbsp; (but there are
plenty on the web- just type in his name!)<br>
but in short he was living in Afghanistan doing charity work and when
the bombing started he took his family over to Pakistan for safety and
he was arrested in the middle of the night, in front of his 6-year-old
daughter, and bundled into the boot of a car where he managed to phone
his dad from his mobile, but then he was put into solitary confinment
for a year and then moved to Gutamino Bay where he has been mistreated.
Although it is a US base- it is up to the UK governemt to release him.
Grrrrrrrr..... i spoke to his dad afterwards and he is really keen for
people t write to their MPs and i have never got around to doing that.
But this time i will *nods* as it has really upset/angered me!<br>
<br>
Also- eeeeeeeeek! Pete had his hair cut!!!!! He no longer looks like a scary cross between Anne Widocome and Pat Sharpe! <br>"

I had an LJ dream. This is worrying. I think it was me and Myfy and Bee talking about something or other- could have been HP actually.

<b>edit:</b> Just remebered another bit of my dream. Bee and Myf and i were discussing the UN declaration of human rights. (why?!?!) We then decided we like article 27 best. ON looking it up it reads:
Article 27.

      (1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.

      (2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.

Most amusing thing that happened to me today though:

James is on other side of me. Completley fail to notice companions on either side are in fact talking to each other. Conversation ends. Rowan is convinced that someone just said they were called Micheal and that she got the wrong number. James comes off phone and says someone just phoned him asking if he were fo Leah.

"event","due to the late hour this will just be a quick update.
Firstly i wish to apologise for the incredably self-pitying rant i had yesterday. Sorry sorry sorry *ducks Myf*. When i feel down i usually tryt and keep it to myself but then sometimes there are so many things at once it all strats pouring out. Which is what happened. So sorry. And you were lovely to me. So thanks.

Secondly- i have been very studenty this evening. After a meeting, several other people and i ordered an Indian take-away. This boy james and i shared a veggie korma but had no cutlery so sat on vanburgh Stalls (a porters' lodge/college reception) eating it with the lid of the packet it came in. Then we found the rice that had been seperated. So this girl Leah (who i don't know that well even) walked back to my house, through the allotments, eating the rice and when we got to my house we made some more and ate her korma and watched Blackadder! hehehe. 

Thirdly- it was my friend Alex's (stupid_alex)birthday! I think he is the first friend from school who i am still friends with who has turned 21! Scary! 15 years ago- maybe even to the day- i went to his birthday party dressed as Burgler Bill. Does anyone else remember that ()the book i mean, not the party)? i feel so old!

Fourthly- i was being narcissistic and also procrastinating, and typed my name into google and found some emensly funny things. I think that Alex (penwing) is the only person i can think of who would find it as funny, but i was being discussed on an SU hacks message board around the time of the conference elections. They wondered what my political alliences were and Iain Lindley (now the youngest tory counciller in the country!) decided that i was ""non-party aligned left-winger"". although ""Her running mate Siobhan is a member of SWSS but failed to get elected; whether Anna will support CFE/SBL or SWSS/FOSIS I have no idea."". hahahahaha. But Dave Sammels (another tory- trying to climb up the young conservative (probably literally) ooops i mean 'Conservative Future')proclained 'Anna is a member of Stuydent broad Left'. No i'm not! Made me laugh all day. Had my faction described as 'YorkSAW' (York Students Agaibst War)- WTF!? There was also a commentery and break down of votes with gems like 'With O'Gorman's [shiv's] impending elimination there were 7 candidates fighting for 4 places, with very little separating any:.......As expected the lion's share of the surplus went to fellow YorkSAW member Liddle, catapulting her up into a more secure position. This left McCarthy next for the chop; with her having no obvious places to transfer, this round could have had a large and random bearing on what would follow...""! Ha! why do they care so much!? It was just NUS crap! hehehe- descibed as ""the left"" in vote break downs. LOSERS!!! *pretends she has not spent all day looking at the message board and wetting herself laughing*
sorry everyone- that isn't particularly interesting. 

Alex (ax_deadparrot) just came and told me off for being 'up past my bedtime'. he can be scary. I must go."

"event","God- just been in floads of tears in a film ""Land and Freedom"" by Ken Loach about the Spanish Civil War (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114671/). I <i>never</i> cry in films (except in Billy Elliott when his dad has to break the strike- although when i mentioned this to Catherine she said 'Anna- you are weird. You should cry in films about fluffy animals and little children, not politics'- but to be honest i don't give a shit about fluffy animals and little children even though I know she was joking).
I may just go and try and phone Shiv. I know she will understand my post Land and Freedom blues. And i need to find out why she didn't come anyway.....

.....well just phoned shiv. didn't talk for very long- she needed a wee- but i feel a bit better. Oh how i cried through that film. I am normally too stubbon to cry in films. I think  ""aah this has been manafactured to make me cry- so i shall not"" but i couldn't help it in this one. I think it is the first one i have cried <i>through</i>. But it wasn't just at the film. Quite a lot of it was through guilt as i am such i fucking apathast who has done NOTHING for the anti-facist movement and anti-war movements, I can't even get a video to work properly. I haven't <i>done</i> anything at all. But crying about it isn't really going to help. But it makes me feel so incredably guilty and powerless. I am so useless. :-( and watching that made me think of all the people being killed in Fulluja by people represnting our country, and the Red Creasnt not even being allowed in,  and how awfully fascit the army is as even if the soliders for some reason tried to leave they cpuld be tried for it. 

I am so lazy. It also made me feel so proud of my gran too, all the work she has done for socailism and anti-facism. She protested about the Black Shirts coming down Kable Street as a teenager in 1936 and i bet i wouldn't have the balls as i am such a wimp. She and my Grandad had police threaten them with trunchans, and that has never happened to me. Does this mean i don't care enough? I've actually had police ask me if i was ok and to let them know if i had problems when protesting on Hiroshma day a few years ago. I think my Gran and Grandad, about my age, cowering in a shop doorway from fascits is one of the romantic things i have ever heard. This is becasue i am odd. Also it had the most uncharacteristic effect on me to want left-wing love. How lovely would it be to share you love with someone who also shared such a huge passion for what you believed in, and struggled together? This film has weird effects on me, Probably won't last long.

But doing this dissertation on student protest movemnts will make me feel so awful and lazy and apathetic. I really wish more people cared so we could work together and make changes. Not overthrow a govenment or anthing like that, as i really don't think i've got it in me and not sure if i would really want to, but just little things. I think i am going to phone my gran tomorrow. I really miss her. I wish i could talk to my dad about the film and stuff but i can't as oter peopple would get in the way and i just want to be able to talk to him on my own, even on the phone and feel like he is mine. Just for a very little time and not have to share him. There is so much i want, but will never have, becasue life sucks so much. People go. also people just don't care about things and watch them go by and don't DO anyrhing when they can. People also don't appriciate what the have got. 

Maybe going to that film wasn't the best idea, eh? But i need to make myself get out, even of it is going to depress me as i am finding it quite difficult to go out. It is weord i keep having mood swings and sometimes don't want to leave the house and i have to make myself. Don't know why though. it isn't as though i am wonderfully happy in here. I also kind of feel myself pushing people away and i don't know why. especially people i am close too. Feel weirdly disembodied alot of the time, almos disconnected and things are happening and i am jsut watching and it isn't really my life and things are going so quickly and i don't understand anything. 

On a lighter note- my desk lamp smells like melting marshmellow and i am not sure why. yumyum."

"event","Slightly worried! :-/ i think i may have done something stupid.
The other day i emailed MAureen Stowe, the women who was conned into standing as a BNP candidate in Burnly Council elections. When she realised their true nature she changed to independant and won't have anything to dowith them. Anyway, now she talks to anti-facsist groups about her experiences. So i emailed her. Just looked at the automated responce and the website, and have realised that the 6 remaining BNP councillers (and some others) share that address! Ooooh dear! I got advice from the 'adult' group in town, recommeding i go through Unite Against Facism, but that was after i sent it and the UAF don't seem to answer when ever i email. 

Also annoyed- next week some Palestinian kids were coming over, touring with a show called 'Dancing for Palestine' to raise awwareness etc. I was going to help look after them one day next week. But now the Isrealis won't let them past the checkpoint- so they can't! They are just kids! MAkes me so mad! 

I was 45mins late for a seminar yesterday! And someone was later than me! [yuck- just started a sentance with ""and""].

MUST WAKE UP! Determined to get my library books back on time. They charge 75p per hour per book. No wonder they keep building extentions etc they must be loaded!"

EEEErrrgh! Went to NUS Extra-ordinary Conference in Wolverhampton
yesterday. Had to get up at 5am for it. Weeewewewgvhgfkhtdd! Is what i
have to say. Loads of crap crap stuff got passed. And the chair was a
right-wing bastad who thought he was funny but wasn't. I feel&nbsp; sorry
for you Bee- he was the President of Irish NUS- a right nobber. He
also- inexplicably- keep talking in Irish Gaelic, completly aware that
almost everyone at the conference couldn't understand him! Odd odd boy.
All the left-wing factions got together to talk- i am kind of on the
edge of one, Student Broad Left, mainly because they are, well broad,
and don't have fixed views. But i don't like being in factiony groupy
things so not a member. IT WAS ALL SO SO BORING!!! BORINGBORING
BORINGBORINGBORINGBORINGBORING! This boy John and I played conference
bingo to pass the time. Apperently people have been thrown out before
for shouting 'Bingo' at inappropriate points. I shouted 'yay' when Hugo
(fascit boy at my uni)'s sister got up to speak and i got my 'Union of
Jewish Students claim anti-sematism' box! <br>

<br>

Arghy- Shiv is coming in less than an hour and i hav got to get dressed
and read an article entitled ""The Toilet Paper: Femininty, Class and
Misrecognition"". Hmmm.....<br>

Hhehhehe- when Tom asked 'Whatzat?!' about the fireworks overhead as we were getting out of the car, my dad said 'Fireworks, unless the Americans have mistaken Saffron Lane [a nearby Leicester estate] for Falluja'. This amused me too much. May upload a photo soon if can work out how to and can be arsed."

I GOT AN INTERVIEW!!! wwwoooooo!!!!!! hoooo!!! They made a mistake :-) and didn't email me! :-) they lost my email or something :-)) I had an interview today and when i didn't turn up they thought this was 'unlike me' (?!?!?)and realised their mistake! so i have one 9:30am tomorrow :-) Now i am shitting myself with nerves! How do you behave in interviews?! Help!

On my way home today i saw 2 houses with their Christmas decorations up! Why?!?! If you have them up for more than 2 months, a sixth!, of a year, how is taht special?! I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MADNESS!

hehehehehehe- <i>hilarious</i> happening in my seminar! tee hee. We have a very old tutor- she is about 103 or something. Anyway- we were talking about adverts and how they can be sexulized. There was this one of a builder with all his tools hanging off his belt. This tutor is quite shortsighted too- and peers really closly at the picture and says, quite inocently, 'My! He is very well equipted!' It nearly <i>killed</i> us! I felt like a naughty 14-year-old schoolgirl! She then proceeded to say 'look at his tools!'. Everyone was bright red at this point, and despretly trying not to look at each other. I found a very intersting bit of woodgrain on the desk to fix my eye on. About an hour later, when we finally escaped the room, everyone burst out laughing! Ahhh it was so funny! The more you can't laugh the harder it is not to! 

Eeeek- just got an email through! The interviews are <i>2 hours long</i> and you have to do a group presentation and have an individual interview! Eeek! and eeeeep!

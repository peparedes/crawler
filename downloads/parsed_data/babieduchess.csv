"event","well, i have relapsed. i found out today. i went to the hospital today and had a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. and my cancer has returned. i have a tumor in the area of the first in my pelvis. and its also in my bones. 
so i need to have my port-o-cath put back in. that should be done sometime next week. im not sure what exactly my treatment will be right now. it will probably be just chemo. 
i cant really have any more radiation right now cuz radiation is localized, and the limit a person can have is 4000 units, and i have already had 3000 units, so having the last 1000 units wouldnt do much good
surgery isnt really an option just yet.
and so i will have to get chemo. 
the docs are gonna try to contact the national cancer institute in maryland to see if they have a better regimen than they are offering here. 
anyway, thats all for now. im tired and sore and tristy so im gonna go. 

love

"event","ok, so i meant to tell all the crap thats been going on with me since i got back from my grammas a few weeks ago. so here it is:
first, because i had done so much more walking than i usually do (and in heeled shoes too) i developed something called metatarsalgia (inflammation on the tendons in my left foot) so i had to stay off it for two weeks. then i somehow managed to strain a muscle in my back turning too fast or something, so that caused pain. then i had my ct scan and a few days later i was tested for a bladder infection (which was negative, thank god) and around that time this other pain in my tumor site started and i talked to one of the docs about it and she said it was probably my body trying to get back to normal (menstural wise) then i talked to one of the nurses and thats when the tests for a bladder infection were done. and then the pain got worse and i talked to the one doc again and thats when she decided i should come in today...and the earlier entry tells what happened. so thats all thats been going on with me. IM FALLING PART! oh and from the place they took blood today, i have a blood blister (blood between the top few layers of skin) *rolls eyes* *sometimes i have to wonder 'why me?'*

tonite, mom and i were going to go do a lil bit of shopping, but we were hungry, so we went to Logans. and the guy i went to prom with, jeff, he was there with some friends even tho its his off nite (he works at logans) so we ate, and he came over and talked to us for a little while, and then we left and were gonna go do our shopping but my pain was getting worse and mom was tired so we decided to just head home and shop tomorrow. so thats what has been going on with me. and for the last 20 minutes or so i have been in an AIM chat with steph and beni. and as fun as it is, i have to leave and go to bed so my body will stop developing all these stupid problems, like my foot and my back and now my tumor site.

goodnite.

"event","im not doing so good lately. it seems that the only time i update this thing is when steph says to me ""update ur lj, babe"" anyway i dont know what is causing the pain yet, i have tests scheduled, but i have been having pain, bad pain, in my tumor site. i went to the clinic today, we talked and they looked at me, and then the docs discussed it for a long time. they said there are 3 possibilities. #1 the phantom pain could have returned, which would explain why the pain meds i take doesnt always help. the treatment of this would be hypnosis, acupuncture, or learning other relaxtion techniques. #2 it could be some kind of infection, and they took blood, and we need the results before treatments of that are discussed, #3 it could be a recurrence of the tumor, they said this is highly unlikely tho, but as a precaution, since nothing showed up on the ct scan in that area, i will be having a bone scan this friday. 
these are the possibilities for my pain. until we know whats causing it, i just have to continue the things i have been doing to manage it, which is alternating aleve, tylenol, and prescription pain relievers (narcotics) and alternating between a heating pad and a cold pack in the area of the pain.
thats all for now.
bye bye

"event","geez, i havent been on here in a while. steph reminded me about it. i just found out last night that my friend mary also uses this site. i didnt even kno. anyway, just like the first entry, i have no clue what to say. theres nothing interesting going on with me. there never is anymore. i put an application in at Logans Roadhouse (steak place, similar to that place in florida that u can throw peanut shells on the floor...I FORGOT THE NAME OF IT!) a long time ago. susan, the manager that i know, said that as soon as they need someone i will be the first they call. I really wanna work there cuz i know most of the people that work there already. susan is so cool. my friend jeff that works at logans, he told me a while back that one nite after closing one of the managers (susan actually, but this was before i met her) came out of the office and soaked a bunch of people with a water gun. so to get back at her jeff and some other people duct taped susan to the office chair and soaked her with the water gun. how many places can u do that to ur boss and not get in trouble? not many. 
i am supposed to have a check-up/follow-up/ct scan on thurday. it was supposed to be last night, but my mom ""says"" she woke up with a migraine. dont kno exactly how tru that is, since she stayed up all night. but whatever.
well im gonna go for now.

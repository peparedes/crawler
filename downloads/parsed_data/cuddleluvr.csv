I get along with my coworkers and most are around my age so it easy to talk to them. I guess cause Im on a computer all day that when i get home i dont want to type anymore lol. Cause right now my fingers are tired, and not liking this haha. But My bday is well....in like 20 mins it will be a day away (its 11:42) so that exciting, although i dont feel as excited as i should.&nbsp; Im going to be 21 soon, but yea the excitement has just gone away. Especially after so many of my friends already turning 21, and yea, its just all feels lame to me.&nbsp; I have to work on my birthday which sucks, but i had to do it last year too cause i went outta town the week after. But since i just started this job i couldnt ask for the day off, and im not gonna just call in cause i need the money. But i have thursday and friday off so I will hopefully try to go out those nights. My mother has been a real bitch about me using the car for anything BUT going to work. So i dunno whats going to happen. I wish i knew someone who had a car for sale, a reliable one. It would be so much easier then going to a dealership.

So my plans are as follows.....Monday night after work Im gonna meet up with a few friends...maybe, tuesday morning i have to go to the stupid DMV to renew my license, then to work and then maybe getting together with whoever can make it. Thursday Im off so prolly sleep most of the day and then like 8 or 9pm going to Margaritaville for some dinner, or appetizers or something and a little drinking, maybe dancing who knows, and then whatever after that depending on who is there and how late they can stay out. (Tabby you and Brian are still invited to come if you can make it. I had to pick Thursday tho cause I work Saturday nights, and a few others have Thursdays off as well (like diana and amber) so...just let me know) Then Friday umm...i dunno, but i want to go out just not to late cause i gotta work Saturday :(...and its pay day!!! :D so thats always good.

I guess thats it for now.&nbsp; Im not sure how many people are gonna be there Thursday, its looking like not too many and that sucks, but because of school and work schedules blah!"

"event","Wow, it has been awhile hasnt it? I guess there are reasons for that. Today was...well not good, i dropped my phone in the little pool we got for Cocoa, now it doesnt work. Tomorrow i have to go to the sprint storeand waste prolly about an hour there just for them to tell me they cant do anything about it. Might have to buy a new one which they will prolly screw me over with.

Before I go to get my phone looked at tho Im going up to Centennial Toyota with my mom to look at getting a car. I hope hope hope they have what I want and that I can afford it. OOh also Im switching over to basically stock at JCP so I will be working 2am to 10am and i will getting about 40 hours a week. so my paychecks will be much bigger, considering i only get 18 hours a week now.



Im going to Boston in September. YAY!!!&nbsp; Going to a baseball game of course.&nbsp; Everything is all paid for, plane tickets, game tickets. Im so happy for the Red Sox right now. They are doing excellent. These past 2 weekends they played against the Yankees, and they won 5 out of 6 games. That is fucking awesome. I hope they can keep things going well for them. Yankees right now are at the bottom of the list. I know they will come back and start winning games, but I just hope that the Red Sox continue to win too.


So my ex is back in my life. I havent talked to him in 2 years, and now all of a sudden there he is.&nbsp; He wants to get back together but Im not sure how I feel about that. Im kinda excited and nervous too. Who knows, I told him i need some time to think about things. I think tho that once my phone is fixed and if Im on the way to getting my new car things will look up again. Then maybe I will give him another chance and our relationship will be better then it was last time."

"event","HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHO TO MARRY? (written by kids)

You got to find somebody who likes the same stuff. Like, if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports, and she should keep the chips and dip coming.
-- Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out later who you're stuck with, by then life has beat you down and peed on you.
-- Kristen, age 10

WHAT IS THE RIGHT AGE TO GET MARRIED?
Twenty-three is the best age because you know the person FOREVER by then,and when it fails, you're young enough to make the mistake twice.
-- Camille, age 10

HOW CAN A STRANGER TELL IF TWO PEOPLE ARE MARRIED?
You might have to guess, based on whether they have frowns on their faces.
-- Derrick, age 8

WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM AND DAD HAVE IN COMMON?
Both don't want any more kids,they said the taste was bad and the meat was stringy.
-- Lori, age 8

WHAT DO MOST PEOPLE DO ON A DATE?
Dates are for having fun, and people should use them to get to know each other. Even boys have something to say if you listen long enough, usually its something clever like gosh you're pretty, or nice boobs.
-- Lynnette, age 8 (isn't she a treasure)

On the first date, they just tell each other lies and then the man puts cab fare on the table and says kick rocks.
-- Martin, age 10

WHAT WOULD YOU DO ON A FIRST DATE THAT WAS TURNING SOUR?
I'd run home and play dead. The next day I would plant some yay inhis house and narc him out to the feds.
-- Craig, age 9

WHEN IS IT OKAY TO KISS SOMEONE?
When they're rich, or they give you a roofy.
-- Pam, age 7

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't want to mess with that.
- - Curt, age 7

The rule goes like this: If you kiss someone, then you should marry them and have kids with them. It's the right thing to do, unless they test positive or smell not so fresh.
-- Howard, age 8

IS IT BETTER TO BE SINGLE OR MARRIED?
It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need to be slinging the love.
-- Anita, age 9 (bless you child)

HOW WOULD THE WORLD BE DIFFERENT IF PEOPLE DIDN'T GET MARRIED?
There sure would be a lot of kids to explain, wouldn't there, not to mention the abundance of pimp style?
-- Kelvin, age 8

And the #1 Favorite is........
HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK?
Tell your wife that she looks pretty, even if she looks like a truck, because lying always makes the situation better, doesn't it?
-- Ricky, age 10"

My supervisor says Im on the shit list (well she said doghouse, but same thing) when I get into work, I didnt show up to work saturday. But its not my fault. She shouldnt have changed my schedule. I requested it off 2 weeks in advanced like Im supposed to and someone goes up to her just over a week in advanced and asks for the day off. Thats just wrong. Then for her to tell me ""well i dont know how she got that day off, she is the only one"" A bold line straight to my face. I will be talking to my manager as soon as he is in while Im at work. I really want to switch departments and go to replenishing which i would work at night and just restock things that need to be put out. it will be great! No customers to worry about no bosses to be impressing while Im trying to work, nothing! Only problem is i have to wait until there is a spot open for me. =( And i would only want to do the replenishing for my department cause i know where everything goes.<br /><br /><br />But.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />whatever.</font></font></b>"

I cant log on to my myspace. for some reason everytime i go to myspace.com it says the page is missing or whatever, it cant be displayed. its really annoying and i dont know how to fix it. Yesterday, or the day before i cant remember, but i started messing around with the settings and things cause my limewire wasnt working, and well i dont know what happened or how it changed and started being stupid and not pulling up search results but i finally went in to the security settings on my computer and put the firewall settings back to default, and then clicked on this thing that i guess limewire uses and boom, it was going again. i was super excited. but not im not cause myspace wont work for me. I wanted to go in and change my profile around. i took out the layout that was on there, and had found another one that i liked, but when i put it in, it was all messed up. Since im not too good with html i didnt know what to adjust to fix it so i just deleted the whole thing. now my page is just plain and boring. and i dont like that. <br /><br /><br /><br />Its been just over a month since my car broke down. It still sucks not having it. I wish i could just get it fixed instead of having to buy a new car. But we will see what happens. I know this guy who is a mechanic so maybe next weekend he will be able to look at it and see if he knows whats wrong and how to fix it and how much it will cost to get the parts and all that. If I could get it fixed I would be the happiest girl in the world. <br /><br />My Uncle was in town this past weekend for a convention/conference (not sure which one, maybe both even) and we went to dinner a couple of times and such. He gave me $100 but I guess it was supposed to go towards a new tv since the one in the living room is broken. It was for me to buy a new one, like a flat screen or whatever and put the tv i have now in the living room. But i really dont want to do that. I mean do we really need one in the living room right now? Our tv has been broken since like november, and its not like Im going around complaining. I really dont mind. My mom says that the money was intended to be for a new tv, and if that is the case he should have given it to her the day the 2 of them went out and i was at work. Cause its not like i asked for the money either. Im not 6 any more i dont expect to get money or something whenever i see a family member from across the country. I want to use that money for a new digital camera. Mine is just about broken. The pictures come out crappy and i have to tape it together so the batteries stay down. When i get paid next friday i want to go to best buy and get one. I cant remember what camera diana got there, but i dont want to get the same one. lol. <br /><br /><br />Hmmm I guess thats all for now. Wow, its been awhile since I wrote in here. I gotta start trying to write in here more often, or just put some bs posts lol.</font>"

My car decided she had enough on the 1st, so now IM car-less until I can afford to buy a new one (which may take awhile). I heard rumors that they might raise the minimum wage $1 more. I hope so cause then I would get a dollar raise too. And that would be fucking awesome!!

I didnt make a new years resolution because I never stick to them, so whats the point? I couldnt think of anything that I could actually accomplish and not be too lazy to do this year. Kinda sad huh? Oh well...things will happen when they are meant to happen.

Cocoa is doing great, although potty training her is a lot tougher then I thought it would be, but she is slowly making progress. She is due for her 2nd set of shots this up coming week, and I hope they arent too much cause I dont have much money left and I wont get paid until next Friday.

I like it at JCP. there are some new people that I dont like, but that was bound to happen. There was this one girl in the beginning that i couldnt stand, and really i still dont like her, but i dont see her that often anymore so its ok. 

Today was my friend Marianna's last day. It was super sad, and a lot of BS went down today too. Again, dealing with some of the new people. Our store manager Eric walks by and there are like 4 girls just standing inside the cash wrap doing nothing, just talking. So he gets all mad and says something about them being fired, but my supervisor talks to them and says, like look, you cant just be standing around you have to do something or else your going to be let go. I hope they listen, I have told people so many times not to stand around, I even try to help them out by telling them what they can do. Cause you know when you are new and there arent any customers you're not really sure what you should be doing. So i try to help them out but they dont listen. Or they go and do that and instead of continuing to do that or other stuff they are back where they started. A couple of them have really bad attitudes, and think they can just say whatever they want. Well they are going to learn quick that, that shit doesnt fly at work. One of the girls was standing there giving me one of those like ""playful attitudes"" where you dont really mean what you are saying, and I told her, ""I advise you to start doing something and not sit there and talk crap cause when Eric watches the tapes its not going to be who gets fired"" and she shut up pretty quick and started working. I like having power lol...even if its not recognized. Everyone (new kids) comes to me with questions, its great sometimes, and other times overwhelming cause everyone needs me at the same time it seems. LIke tonight for instance. I had to close with 3 new kids. 1 kinda knew how to close the register and the other 2 girls had never done it before. So there I was basically teaching them all how to do it and do mine at the same time. I felt like I was teaching a class. 


Tomorrow is VIP night, which means basically if you go there after a certain time you will get extra discounts no matter if you have a JCP card or not. Im not sure what time it starts but I know we have to stay open until 9pm instead of 7pm like normal Sundays.

So I heard an earful from him about that. and then when I saw him again right before I left and showed him my tattoo, he wasnt pleased with that either.&nbsp; Im just turning into another hooligan apparently.&nbsp;

Lets see what else?

Last night I went with Diana and Christina out to Cheesecake Factory, and then to Bad Apple Tattoo to get Christina's tattoo colored in. I had fun.

I guess thats all for now, I dunno what else to say really."

Now I just need more money, cause Im gonna want ringtones lol. Speaking of money, I applied at the Orleans. Christine said they need people badly so hopefully I can get that. I would start off at like 12 something an hour. Then after so many hours it goes up to like 14, so thats double what I make now. I hope I get it. Then I wont be broke anymore. Well maybe but only because of me buying more stuff. But Im gonna try and control that. My birthday is less than a week away and I have nothing planned. Thats a first for me. Usually I have something planned by the time its 2 weeks away. Plus Im broke, so that really sucks. I get paid Friday so if I do anything it will be this weekend. But Amber wont be in town cause her stupid brother had to go and get married right before my birthday. Which means I have to wait until after I get back to do something with her. That sucks. I wanted all my friends to be together like every year. I think Im going to try and go to dinner on Friday, maybe Saturday depending on how many people can go to which night. And then have to wait until I get back in town to do something with the rest of them. So to anyone who is reading this, which day is better for you?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Oh yea and guess what!?!?!?!??!?!?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I get to see the Killers tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />Well hopefully I get the wristband to get in to the show.

"event","<strong><font color=""#0000ff"" size=""4"">Usually I dont wish for things to go badly for people, but in this case I did. Coincidently, its working to my liking. Ok heres the situation.....there is this guy that I like, well, he knew or should have known that i liked him. Im more than obvious most of the time. Anyways I guess he had been talking to this girl for awhile (longer than i have known him) and she recently became single. So he asked her out. Well when he told me that he started dating her, i didnt know what to do. It felt like my heart was ripped apart. Until that moment, I didnt realize how much I liked him. After I got off the phone with him, all I could think was that I hope it failed, and that she is just a horrible gf. And that he would get tired of her or annoyed enough and just dump her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today I called him. I havent talked to him since that last phone call.(maybe 2 weeks ago? I&nbsp;cant really remember)&nbsp;He was supposed to call me the next day cause we were going to hang out. But he never did. And honestly I wasnt going to answer his call if he had called me. But anyways, I talked to him briefly today (he was at work) and he said that she has been annoying and something else, i couldnt really hear him. But he wasnt too happy with her. He told me he would tell me all about it later on when he gets off work. Its kinda funny how things work out sometimes. I dont know for sure yet if he is just going to put up with it for awhile longer or if he is going to dump her soon or what, but it doesnt matter either way. Its his life, and his decisions.<br /><br />Anyways, it seems life keeps throwing me disappointments, and Im not sure how much longer I can&nbsp;handle it. I should be happy right now, my birthday is coming up, I get to go to Boston for a week right afterwards, but............Im not. I hate this town. I have seen what it does to people, it tears them apart. My mom has really been thinking about selling the house next year. She wants to move back home, and really I dont blame her. I just dont know anymore. I dont know what to do, I dont know what to think.<br /><br />Im just..........lost.</font></strong>"

Now thats unusual for her, but I replied to her saying no, and then she called me. What could be so urgent when I just talked to her about an hour ago??? Well it seems she let her brother use her car to drop her Dad off, and the back tire blew out on the way home. So instead of Tony calling her and telling her he just walks home. He gets home and she asks where the car is and he tells her its over by the Jack In The Box on Craig. Like the <em>good </em>brother that he is, he lets her walk there by herself IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!!!!. So anyways she calls me up and I meet her up there, she didnt get very far from her house. We drive over there and he parked it in the Firestone parking lot. With the 2 of us barely knowing how to change a tire, we get thru it. It took us about an hour I think, but it was dark, and we had an old shitty jack. Not one of the new ones where its easy, oh no...lol. But it was quite an experience. At least now I know that I can change a tire if I ever have to be in that situation again."

Plus its close to home. I have an interview thingy on Tuesday at like 1:30 before I go to work. Umm...lets see. Work was good today. I bought some socks, and a necklace. Its cute. It was too busy. We got out of there early. My manager said we could get out early, it was cool. We got to go before everyone else in the store. See what happens is at the end of the night after we close and kick all the customers out the door everyone has to clean the sales floor (straighten tables i.e. fold clothes, fix the racks etc..) and so when all the departments are clean and everything is put back where it should be, a manager gets on the loud speaker and tells us we can close our registers. We arent allowed to do it before that unless we are told we can, as in tonight. It was cool, everyone was looking at us like ""did they call it?"" ""why are they leaving?""&nbsp; It was great, we got out of there before 9:30pm. thats a good thing considering we are schedule until 9:45.<br /><br /><br />So after work I went with Diana and Christina to the Texas to go bowling. It was cool we all won one game. She's fun to hang with. It was a good night except for this crazy girl in the lane next to us who would just toss any ball she picked up down the lane. She picked up mine once and I almost cried. I know what you might think, its just a ball. But no. When you spend that much money on a ball, its not just a ball any more. But anyways, that was all.

Maybe things will go well, I dont like to get ahead of myself, but I dunno we shall see.<br /><br /><br />Umm.....Think think think.................................Almost got a new phone the other day, that was a bust. Its ok though. Ohh....me and Diana went to a party Friday night. It was soo much fun. We thought it was going to be lame cause everyone who was going to go cancelled on him, and well that just sucks. So Diana was like we should just leave if this sucks, but it didnt. We had fun. Christine and Emilio joined us too. It was great. There is another one this Friday coming up at the Aladdin. Its going to be great. Cant wait. Payday is on Friday also, and I dont have to work. Yay!!! I need money. Im like broke. I gotta stop shopping. No I need a 2nd job. Which Im working on. No biggie. Also on Friday is Superman Returns Movie. Cant wait to see that.

Ok so there is no hiding it, its about Ashleigh and Crystal. Ashleigh wrote a blog tonight after she got back from the Trapt concert talking about her day and stuff. Well her and Crystal are mad because Jon put me on his top 8 and this girl named Brittany, and had taken Crystal off. Crystal and Brittany also USED to be friends. I think the whole thing is so stupid. How are you going to get mad at someone because they rearrange their top 8? Its just a fucking website!!! GET OVER IT!!! All I gotta say is they better not call me or send me stupid messages and be mad at me for it. I had nothing to do with it. I just went and looked at his profile a few days ago cause I hadnt gone to it in awhile, and there I was in his top 8. I havent talked to him in forever. So I hope they know I had nothing to do with that, i didnt ask him to put me there and to take her off. I could care less if some people dont have me on their top 8. Its just a website!!! People please!&nbsp;<br /><br />Then talk about weird, Ashleigh's ex-boyfriend IM's me tonight. He had a different screen name. and had said he lost the password to his old one. I dunno if i believe it was him though, cause ashleigh was logged on to her aim at the same time. It seemed like it was him, because I remember how he would talk to me before, but its still questionable. I guess him and ash had gotten into a fight again a few weeks back and he hasnt talked to her since then. He said he was trying to IM her on aim but she wouldnt respond to him. Which is something she would do, but she might have also just made up a new screen name and was pretending to be him, I dunno, i dont care. I didnt talk crap about her so she has nothing, if it was her.<br /><br />Eh, my night was ruined. I have a headache now.</font></font></p>"

"event","<p>So I have decided that I want that new Toyota Yaris. Its so cute. Hopefully I can win some money when we go to Cali and have extra spending money, and some money to save and put in my account for my new car. Thats my goal. I want that car. I figured if I average about 31 hours a week, I will make about $900 a month (before taxes of course). As long as I keep my expenses down, and just not buy so much stuff I should have&nbsp;just under&nbsp;$3,000 by October and that should be ok. The one I want is $14,050. I was on the website and if I got all the features and add-ins and all that that I want its almost $18,000. I think I would rather just go to the dealer and pick from what they have. It should be cheaper. I dunno. Then since Im a first time buyer, a girl, under 25, blah blah blah, the interest rates are gonna be huge! I cant even think about buying it untile like October tho. After My trip to Boston and all that. Im still not sure if I have to play for that ticket or not. My uncle owes me a Christmas present still, so he was thinking about buying my ticket. I dont know yet. (I need to talk to Amber about her car payments and how much BS she went through.)<br /><br />Ooh!! At work today, I was offered a new job. lol. Yea I know I just started this one. But I think I would be getting paid like $11 an hour. So that would be even better and I can get my car even faster. Im going to consider it after I get back from Cali. I might call him and see if it would be possible to work like part-time. Ok, so here is what happened. I had this couple come to the register, and I was ringing up their stuff, and his wife was asking me questions about some of the clothes and when the next sale is and all that. Since I have only been there like a week, I told her I wasnt sure. Then the husband asked me about returns and if there was a limited time on when they can bring them back and all that, so I found this little booklet that talks about returns and handed it to them. They walked off and were about to go out the door when he turned around and asked me how long I have been working there. I told him about a week. Then he asked if it was my first job and I told him no.&nbsp; So he told me the reason he was asking was because he is the manager at the Pharmacy in Walgreens, and told me if I ever wanted a change or needed a new job to just call him. His wife gave me his business card, and he told me if I had any friends who were looking to call too. Anyways, he said I was really nice, friendly and helpful, so thats why he had offered it to me. My friend's girlfriend works at a Walgreens and she was going to transfer to the Pharmacy but she couldnt because she never graduated from high school, but he told me that he thinks he remembers her saying they had told her she would start at $11 an hour. He also told me that they have you take classes and what not so you know everything you are supposed to. But its run by them so you dont have to do it on your own, or already know the stuff to get the job. He told me its by the Rio and their offices and stuff, so whenever they have meetings its over there.<br /><br /><br />Ok so I have rambled on enough, Im going to bed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh and in case anyone cares Boston won 9-5 over the Yankees today!</p>"

"event","So its been awhile. I didnt realize how long it has been since my last post. I have so many accounts on websites that have journal type things on them that I just forget which ones I have written in and when. I usually write about different things in different ones. It all really depends on what its about and knowing who will be able to read it.

Lets see......what has happened since the 12th? Well it was Amber's birthday for one. So on the 13th we went to dinner. (Olive Garden) and then after that we went to Circus Circus and rode on the roller coaster. It was fun. Havent done that in awhile. I think the last time Amber went was in the 8th grade on the science trip. And then we went home. Everyone was pretty tired. I had to work that day. It was day 2 of my training. It was fun. Kinda. We got done early so she told us we should go up on the floor and get some practice in. It was really hectic and crazy. The kids area is pretty much half of the top floor, so its sooo big. Its hard to remember where everything goes. There were also a lot of people there since it was a saturday and we were having a huge sale for mothers day.

Me, Diana, Christine, and Amber went to the gym on Monday night. It was fun. I think that was the hardest I have worked out of all the times we have gone. We are going tomo...well tonight after Diana gets off work. Im not sure if Amber is going to come or not. I think she might be working.

Today me, Christine, and Diana went shopping. Well kinda. Christine was looking for a new bathing suit. We went to Target first, and then into the Boulevard Mall to look around there. She really wanted to get a Jose Cuervo one. Although I dont think I have ever seen her drink it. But we couldnt find anything. We went to Applebees for dinner since it was right there. Then to the forum shops cause they have a Corona Store. She decided that would have to do. Dont ask me why but she really wanted an alcohol related suit. So we go to the forum shops and come to find out the store isnt there any more. Ok next plan, we have to go to the Aladdin cause that is the only other place we know of that sells that stuff. So Diana is ""tired"" and goes home. No big deal, but I think she needs some energy pills (haha...druggie!!) So me and Christine go to the Aladdin (old faithful lol jk) We go looking around to see whats new and whats still around, and how the construction is effecting the inside for the transformation into Planet Hollywood. We stop at Bikini Bay. Their stuff is waaay expense. But I actually liked some of it. Too bad, Im cheap(and poor). We walk around and I see my friend Chris, still working there as a peddy-cab driver(not sure how you spell that) He is busy so we keep walking. We get around to the little corona kiosk and they dont have the bathing suits for the girls, just trunks for guys (of course!) She says she wants to go to Sephora so we walk back that way. I told her I wanted to go say hi to Chris and we decide to take the long way. Of course he got a ride so he wasnt there. We went to the bathroom and that was closed so we had to walk around to get to the other one. Man! What a pain. On our way to Sephora I spotted Chris. We talked for a little bit, I gave him my number so we could hang out sometime. We get to Sephora and I think the security guards think Im trying to steal! I was going to get this one kind of lip gloss but I didnt want to get the wrong flavor and it didnt say on the box, so Christine tells me ""Just open it"" So I do and the minute I do some guy comes out from the back. Of course where I was there was a camera right on me and I was right in front of the door to that back room. He comes out and immediately looks at me and says hi. I knew what had happened. He keeps walking like he was just coming out to do survailence on the store. I decided not to get it cause I dont want to spend that much on it. Not at least until after I get paid. But after that incident I just want to get out of there. I dont need them trying to retain me in there and look thru my purse. I had no intention of stealing some stupid over priced lip gloss, and if he had asked me what I was doing I would have told him straight out. Eh, moving on......................

I tell Christine we should go cause I remembered there is another Corona kiosk by Gameworks right by the food court thats upstairs. We parked in the Denny's parking lot thats right there cause it was close, and well, you're not supposed to but we did anyways. We were just going to be like 10 minutes(and at like 8:30pm) so we thought it was alright. She finds the suit she wants and as we were walking back to the car we both kind of decided we didnt want to go home just yet. We move the cars to the MGM parking lot and go to gameworks. We play a few games, almost every machine I pick is broken or something doesnt work right, and Christine gets free credits like everywhere. The last time we went DDR wasnt working but it is this time. One problem on the left side(my side) the up arrow doesnt work. We tell them at the front desk and they came by and gave us some free games cause they are having problems with the left side and need to send it in. So that was cool me and her just traded off. After that we were pretty much ready to go to bed. So we split and went home."

I didnt even know they were giving away tickets for the show. I was just driving home from hanging out with Christine and Emilio and she said caller number 10, I called it was busy. So I tried again and boom! Caller number 10! I think I would have screamed if I werent in the car.

Its just horrible looking. I know she wants new ones, and maybe this will help make things taste better. Plus it will also help me learn how to cook better. Its something I have always wanted to do, just never had that much of a reason or chance to expand it.

Ambers birthday is 2 days before that, and Im not sure what Im going to get her. I have an idea, and I know she will like it but it just needs something more to it. I really wish she would decide on what she wants to do, and on what day. She told me of an idea she had but who knows how many times she could change her mind before the time comes."

"event","<p><font color=""#33ff99"" size=""4"">Today is the day. The infamous May Day. All across the country people are marching. I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand I support it. I think its great that they are taking a stand and marching all day. A non-violent rally. Which is always good because no one is getting hurt, going to jail, nothing is being broken, or stolen. Its a good way to protest. On the other hand, whats it going to prove? How is this going to work? All that it is doing is closing down businesses for the day, kids are not learning because they have boycotted schools. A little less stuff is being bought today. There are no fruits or veggies being harvested for the day. Its just showing that today nothing is being done. Big deal! It shows the government how many ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS we actually have in this country. They are getting drivers licences, health care, and tons of other stuff that they shouldnt get because they are not US citizens. If they wanted to they could just take them all back on buses or whatever, but they are not going to do that. Why? Because its a stupid idea, they will just come back. If these people actually tried to become citizens and wages were increased things would be fine. They are trying to pass a law or something that says if you are an illegal immigrant its a felony, so you would go to jail for it. I think thats stupid, they are just going to fill up jails across the country. Theres going to be no room for the people who actually belong there.&nbsp; Where are all the murders and rapists going to go? The immigrants just want to work. So what is putting them in jail going to do? They sit there for a little while and then what? Send them back to Mexico?<br /><br />I dunno...Ugh! Its just aggravating<br /><br /><br />Cant wait to go see The Subways tonight. I hope its still going on cause there is supposed to be some march starting at 6pm on Freemont Street.</font></p>"

"event","<p><font color=""#ff66ff"" size=""3""><strong>So this guy I used to talk to came online today.&nbsp; I havent talked to him in awhile, so it was nice to see him on. Well we started talking and I found out that he is engaged and living with this chick. The only problem I have with this is that they have only been dating for 3 months. 3 MONTHS!!!! Can you believe that? It makes me upset, since I know he has doubts about it. So we were just talking and got on the subject of why me and him never dated. So we got a lot of things out in the open, and cleared up a lot of misconceptions. He tells me that he still has feelings for me and basically has the entire time we have known each other. Which has been about umm....I wanna say like 3 years. I always knew he liked me, but I never thought he did after the many times we stopped talking. I tell him, that its not right for him to be telling me that he still has feelings because he is engaged. He tells me that its ok cause she (his fiance) flirts with guys all the time. So Im sitting there in shock staring at the computer screen trying to figure out what to say to him. How could someone who is engaged know that his fiance flirts and does nothing about it. He tells me that she is always touching some guy at work, and that she has seen her do it but she doesnt know that he knows.....did that make sense? So anyways I ask him why he doesnt say anything to her about it, and he tells me he doesnt want&nbsp;to upset her.&nbsp;So&nbsp;I ask ""Is she psycho?"" (The last girl he dated tried to&nbsp;kill him because he said hi to me at the pool hall. And that she thought I was pretty and a threat to her.) He tells me no, but he doesnt want to mess anything up and risk losing her.&nbsp;Can anyone else see the many problems with that relationship?? I can, and it pisses me off. Trust me I dont know anymore about their relationship then what I have put here.&nbsp;<br /><br />So now I dont know what to do. Everytime we talk the feelings he has for me come back to him even stronger. I know cause he told me. We had started talking at the end of last year, cause I spotted him online and we would just email each other, Then all of a sudden the emails stopped coming. I kept sending him some saying things like Im not sure if you are getting this or what happened? And I got nothing. So when I asked him about it, he told me he couldnt talk to me cause he wanted to be with me, and didnt think that would happen. He didnt think I would date him because of something I said at a party to his friend while I was drunk! Yea, anyone who has seen me drunk knows I dont make sense, and sometimes I make things up. lol, I know Im weird. most people tell the truth when they are drunk. Nope, not me...lol.&nbsp;So I figured out what I said and thats part of what we got straightened out. Anyways, Im kinda rambling, and I dunno. The whole thing threw me off. Im not sure what to think about it all. If him and this chick are happy together I dont want to mess things up thats for sure. But he wants me to come by his new place to see it....while she is at work! I know he wont try to hit on me or anything but its still weird.&nbsp;<br /><br />Im so confused!

Scrabble - Yeah I know, Im a nerd, but I love that game. It makes you think, your vocabulary gets put to good use and increases. Its a fun way to save money and catch up with friends.<br /><br />2. Spiders - I hate spiders. They freak me out so badly. I hate all bugs in general but a spider is like 10 times worse. I freeze up like its a snake about to bite me. And then I scream for whoever is home, while keeping my eye on it. Eww!!<br /><br />3. Shamrocks - Otherwise known as 4 leaf clovers. Im Irish and they are a part of that. I take great pride in my heritage, so I love shamrocks.<br /><br />4. Saved By The Bell - I love this show!!! Its apart of my ""childhood"" haha...its great, and anyone who doesnt like, well....they suck. And better have a good reason. It represents all the shows I watched back then.<br /><br />5. Sleep - I love to sleep. Sometimes too much. Its always great to be nice and cozy in your bed and know that everything is going to be ok.<br /><br />6. Symbolism - Everything means something. Whether people want to believe or not. Everything is symbolic. I love it when I figure out what something symbolizes at a later time, especially if its a good thing. It makes me happy.<br /><br />7.&nbsp; Stupidity - I hate it. I hate when people are stupid. Now Im not just talking about just not knowing something. I mean when people do out-right stupid things and know what they are doing is stupid. That just aggravates me to the end.<br /><br />8.&nbsp; Simple - I like to keep things simple. Things go so much better when they are kept simple. There's no reason to make things more complicated then they have to be.<br /><br />9. Stereo - Its very important to me. I would go nuts with out it.<br /><br />10. Spontaneous - Sometimes I just like things to be on the spur of the moment. It keeps things interesting, like going to play basketball at 10pm after playing scrabble. Or last minute trips to California.</strong></font>"

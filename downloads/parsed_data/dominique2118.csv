"event","Sitting here watching rerun after rerun of Sex and the City alone, I wonder...What is the reason for missing someone so much when they're not there?  I spent the entire weekend being angry at the person who I hold closest to my heart.  Now grant it, it was a good reason to be angry, but why do we hold our emotions inside ourselves until it explodes?  Why do we suddenly feel so empty inside when our ""other half"" is gone?  I honestly hate feeling this vulenerable.  I feel like i'm back in middle school, wondering if the cute quarterback was going to ask me to the school dance.  I'm not sure where all these emotions are coming from...Maybe being stuck in the apartment because of sickness for the last three days have something to do with it. I think i'm going to continue watching SATC and be content with everything."

"event","I'm very much into making my life more Zen nowadays.  I'm not turning into a Buddhist but any means, but I honestly believe that making my life more zen will create more peace in my life.  I have the entire morning to myself before work, and I normally get up, immediately go to the gym, then come home shower, eat lunch, and write in my journal, read, and/or play with my pets.  Even though it doesn't sound like much...it's a routine.  A routine that I like to stick to, and it makes my days go by so much easier and happier.  It makes me want to go through my daily routine...and not only am I working out in the process...i'm also eating healthier, and being aware of what kind of food I put in my mouth.  That makes me happy, because Luke and I (in April) are going on a cruise, and I would love to be 20+ lbs lighter, and have an amazing time.  Well, that's all for now."

"event","Life is a lot happier nowadays.  I honestly think it was all stress, and not being able to see my family and boyfriend for the holidays.  I have everything worked out so where I can go home for December 23rd and 24th.  I'm so happy now, because I miss my family so much.  

I'm also back in the routine of working out again.  I forgot how happy and productive it made me feel.  I jog on the treadmill sometimes, but mostly I powerwalk during Gilmore Girls for 45 minutes.  It's better than nothing, I suppose.  I also love spinning classes....it really makes me feel good about myself.  

I read this Zen Habits blog, and one of the suggestions was to make yourself accept where you are in life right now, as opposed to constantly thinking about the future. And that was a big part of my stress.  I constantly think about studying for the GRE, grad school, do I want to go back this fall, where do I see myself in 5 years, how can I get a raise, ect ect.  I have finally reached a point in my life, that I AM a grown up now.  I can do this on my own, work 40+ hours a week, love my job, and come home and relax.  The money comes in time and experience...until then i'll just have to watch my spending.  And after all of this, and making myself aware of this new trait I have, St. Joseph told us we're getting a raise...and then...I was offered the next person to have weekends off!!  Hopefully things are falling in place just like I have planned...I just have to sit back and breath sometimes before they can happen."

"event","Okay, time for a little update on my life.

-I moved to Cincinnati, OH and work as a Residential Treatment Specialist for male sex offenders (ages 11-17 years old).
- I love my job, but I work 2nd shift, with Sundays and Mondays off, and I have to work holidays and lots of overtime.
-sometimes, my job can be dangerous (getting punched in the face, ect) but I never have been hurt, and most of my kids respect me, even when angry
-I get yelled at and cussed out on a daily basis
-I make a direct impact on the kids at work, because I am the person that works with them the most
-I don't have a lot of friends here, for some reason, and idk why
-I'm very homesick, miss my dad, and best friends
-I moved in with my boyfriend, and love it 100% (even when i'm angry with him)
-it's very gloomy in Cincinnati at times, but the days it's nice, I take my dog on a walk down by the Riverbend, and it's the most amazing place i've ever been.  It's beautiful.
-I work on Christmas, and most of the days around Christmas (with the exception of Christmas eve) i'm a bit sad by this...
-I try to workout everyday, but I need a lot of motivation.  I REALLY want to lose weight so I can look and be healthy.
-Every single person around me w/ the exception of my bf thinks i'm insane for working at my job, and I should find a new one because ""grown ups work 8-5 everyday with weekends off""...I get an immense amount of pressure from everyone around me....they don't get that people still need help after 8-5pm.

*I think that's just a brief update of my life.  Everyone please look at my previous post and write some suggestions.  Thank you!"

I would just love some new and fresh ways of making my day a little happier (especially these cold, rainy days when I feel blah.)

"event","So one of my sisters (a close one) is single, and an old sister (not in it anymore, who is a bit shady) randomly calls her to come to ft. wayne to go to a party on friday.  This sister has told me all about it, and how she gets to meet this ""guy"".  Let's give him the name ""Bob"".  Lets give the sister who is still a sister the name ""Lisa"" and the shady ex sister ""Amy"".  So Bob has been calling Lisa numerous times during the day for the past three days.  Four to five times in one day.  They have never met, nor have they ever talked before three days ago. This sister really wants a boyfriend, and wants to find someone to be with.  She then proceeded to ask me my opinion on the matter....this is my opinion.  

I think it's a bit shady that he wants Lisa to come to ft. wayne to see him.  Why can't he come here?  Lisa is going to the party alone, without any friends, but the shady Amy.  This girl is really shady, and on numerous drugs.  I told Lisa I don't feel that it's safc, and I have a really unsettling awful feeling about the situation.  I think that Bob is trying way too hard to win her over, and possibly seeing her as an easy target for sex, or whatever. It's kind of like ths situation where the 911 people advertise for a missing person.  The girl always goes to a random party, and ends up dead in a river three days later after being tortured....maybe i'm overexaggerating a bit, but I feel that Lisa is putting herself in a situation that she might not be able to handle, especially if there is drinking invoved. Lisa is now pissed that I can't ""accept that fact that a guy might like her w/o wanting sex...."" I say that's bullshit, and if he honestly liked her THAT much...he would go to neutral ground and meet.  Comments welcomed.  Thanks!"

"event","Okay, time for a brief update.  Graduation is in 12 weeks.  I could not be happier.  I'm so sick of muncie, and everything in it.  It is also bittersweet, because I have taken for granted a lot of things in the past four years.  The good conversations, walking my dog with a friend on a sunny day, or all day veg fests when it's raining outside.  I'm going to miss all of these things terribly.  I just can't wait to have my OWN apartment (minus my dad), my own career, my OWN problems....everything.  I know i'm being a bit selfish, because my dad has been such an influential mentor in my life.  But it's just time, ya know?  It's time to let me spread my wings and fly....and that's what I intend to do! Schools going wonderful.  Can't wait to be done.  I just rocked out an 18 pg paper in two hours tonight....I must say that's baller.  I'm going to sleep in tomorrow, and then get up, and have a relaxing day! The boyfriend and I are doing good....a bit hard at times, but it's well worth it :)  Still moving to Columbus, OH in three months to be closer to him.  Yep...such a big girls step.

"event","Hey everyone.  It's been awhile.  I have kind of melted into this hermit, so to speak, not wanting to talk/see anyone.  I have been really sick for the past three weeks, and I hurt my foot @ Crush Dance, causing me to be on crutches for a week...boo to that!!  lol.  So here's a little update:

Spring Break plans are a negative.  I was going to go to South Carolina to see my mama, and those plans kind of went to hell.  I was going to go w/ Lexi, but my mama and I had this huge disagreement, and so I ended the visit.  Lexi and I then decided to go to her house over Spring Break, and I gladly accepted, and come to find out, my boss @ BSU really wants me to work full time over break.  Now, I need the money, and I need to work on internship stuff, because i'm so far behind.  And with 18 credit hours, I really need to get on the ball.  I also need to schedule and interview with my potential internship site (A Better Way, here in good 'ol Muncie, In).  I really hope Lexi isn't angry with me, because I don't think i'm going to go home with her...cause I haven't told her just yet.

Graduation Plans:
I plan on graduating this July after my internship.  The only problem is I have to get Cs in all of my classes this semster.  Now, i'm doing really well, with the exception of my international relations class.  I failed the first exam, and I only have two more.  Yikes!! And I studied hardcore for it too...so idk what to do.  As long as I get Cs in my classes, I don't care what I get...I just want to get my degree, and get out of here.  I then want to move to Columbus, OH, to pursue Domestic Violence/Child Abuse.  I want to become a victim advocate, so hopefully, there will be a job opening.  Any suggestions anyone?  Also, that's close to my boyfriend, so no more two hour drives to see each other.  So the relationship is oh so serious!! 

The relationship:
it's going very well.  Although, Luke said something the other night that...we will eventually get in fights, ya know?  And I told him that I get scared during fights bc I think that he'll break up with me.  It's just how I think.  I know he won't, but I still get so scared, because i'm letting down my wall, and letting him in.  It's been almost 6 months, and we haven't had one fight.  Or arguement, or disagreement.  I know they're normal and healthy, and if they happen, they happen...I just don't want him to break up with me because of it.  And i'm not sure why his statement bothered me so much...cause normally it doesn't.  Also, I get completely wrapped up in the future, I wish I could stop.  I KNOW he's the person I eventually want to get married to, and have a life with, and that just scares me period, because I know he's not thinking like that right now.  Not that I expect him to by any means...idk...it's all cloudy really.  

Well, i'm getting back to work!! <3 to you all!!"

I also found a website online that professionally sends out cookies that look like those candy sweethearts everyone eats.  So i'm going to bake heart shaped sugar cookies, and put blue and white frosting on them, and personalize them :)  Although, i'm not sure if I should put something sweet on all of them, or mix 'em up kind of scandelous, and lovey dovey, like ""I love you"" on it? I also typed up my letter already to him, but I think i'm going to handwrite it out, so it's more personal.  Any cute ideas on what to write it on/give to him, whatev?  I'm also going to put the cookies in a blue wire basket I got for him, that he can use anytime AFTER Vday....He's coming this weekend, so i'm giving him all of the stuff then, so I have a little bit of time to do all of this.  

Random question:  okay..you know those cute flower pens you see in the stores?  Well I would like to make some, and really have no idea how...any suggestions?  I'm feeling really crafty :):)

I'm getting used to seeing him every weekend, and I know he's not going to be able to come here every weekend, and vice versa, and i'm going to be very disapointed.  I have never ever been this much in love though, in my entire life.  I am not officially one of those ""cheesy gay"" females who wants to be lovey dovey, and stuff.  I really need some valentines day ideas, cause my gift I was going to give, fell through.  If you want to know more...just ask me.  So far, i've decided to give him a note I wrote (typed, it's one and a half pages, single spaced) but I want to write it out because it's more personalized.  I thought about giving him a picture frame of us in it...but that's so freaking cliche...I want something cheap, and meaningful.  I hate this holiday anyway, but I want to make it special for him.  I could care less if I got anything...alright...i might just be a bit sad.  But not too much.  It's a holiday Halmark can make money off of.  And I might bake him cookies, or rice crispy treats or something....but it can't be chocolate, cause he's not a big fan.  Please guys...give me some ideas!!

Woke up on Saturday, and did the same thing.  On Sunday, I felt mucho better, but still a tad sick.  I decided to go out for a bit on Sunday.  Miss Katie Bills wanted me to tag along with her, so I took my friend Heather, and off we went.  We ate dinner at Bdubs (well I drank...), went to Dill Street for a bit, and then headed to SAE.  I'm not really into partying at the frat houses anymore...but there wasn't much to do in Muncie when everyone leaves...so I decided to rekindle old times :)  As I walked into the house, and up the stairs...my amazing boyfriend was there waiting one me =)  He was SUPPOSED to still be in Iowa, but his family left early, so after being in a car for 12 hours, he then proceeded to drive another 2.5 hours to come to Muncie =)  We spend the entire evening together, and the entire next day.  It was nice actually seeing him in daylight, for once, since he's an architect major, and is only around during the nighttime....I was beginning to think he was a vampire, or something.  He went home last night though after we went to see a movie, and I was so sad he left =( He starts his internship/job today, and he's so nervous.  I'm sure he will do just fine...I just wish it was a bit closer to home :(  Oh well.  I'm hoping i'll still see him at least every other weekend...that would make my entire week!! Anyhow...enough with the negative talk...I was just so excited to see him, when I thought I wasn't going to see him for at least another two weeks!!!

"event","So it's been over a month since i've posted.  I just haven't really found the time to update, nor have I expressed any real interest in doing so.  But tonight, drugged up on coffee...I have expressed such interest.  So much has been going on in my life.  So we're just going to break my life down...so here we go.  

School:  Is going well.  I'm suprisingly doing better than I had expected.  I am still a bit confused about all of my credits and such.  I feel like i'm more ahead than I thought I was.  Hmm...I think that I need to make an appointment with an advisor who actually understands me when I converse with them, instead of my Asian advisor, who is the bomb, but does not come across as very clear at times.  I'm taking a bunch of political science classes next semester, very difficult ones, and I feel that I don't need that many in order to complete my minor..I will soon find out.  

Pi Phi:  I am the new Vice President of Membership.  I am very excited, yet very apprehensive about this position as well.  I never viewed myself as ever being recruitment chair, and i'm not really sure why.  I feel like this is one of the hardest positions in Pi Phi, and yet, they placed it in my hands.  I'm very nervous, even though I know I can do a good job.  I'm just so nervous.  I'm also apprehensive about next semester because all of my close friends are leaving.  I'm so sad about this really.  Even though I know and understand that this is a part of life, and college does eventually have to end...I just hate that it's going to end so soon...I'm one of the few lucky ones who actually realizes this sooner than later...and i'm trying to make the best of every situation and experience handed to me.  

Love Life:  My boyfriend is absolutely amazing, for lack of a better term.  I competely understand the feeling now of being completely happy with someone.  He's an architecture major, so I don't get to spend a great amount of time together...but I feel like this is going to be a serious long term relationship.  We've had a couple of conversations about it, and even though he isn't going to be @ BSU anymore (he's doing his internship in Ohio next semester, then he graduates) I feel like we can make it work.  I know he is the person i'm going to be with, and i'm completely in love with him.  I cannot express this feeling with him, because I feel like it's too soon, and I don't want to scare him and push him away.  He has never dated anyone over 2 months before, and I feel like if I reveal that part of my emotions, he will put his wall up, and block me out.  I am so happy with him, because we have this understanding that we cannot spend 24/7 with each other, because we are two very busy individuals, and we are both alright with that.  That is a very big thing with me, to have our own lives as well as with each other.  I haven't been this serious with a guy since Stephen or Adam, and I am so emmersed with love, it's not even funny.  But to all of y'all who happen to know him or something...keep your mouths shut!! lol

Well, I think that concludes my little update for the evening.  I need to get to bed because I have a political science exam tomorrow i'm stressing about.  Happy Holidays everyone!! And yay for the snow coming!!"

"event","So much has went on in this past week.  I am really not going to do into details or specifics, but we'll just keep it at that.  In the end, I felt completely stupid, because I was about to throw away and quit the number one organization in my life.  I know to some that means nothing, and to others it means everything.  Hence why i'm not going into specifics.  I can to the realization that giving up is just the easy route.  Giving up is for the individuals who are not strong enough to stand for what they believe in, even if that means apologizing for a wrong that you have done, instead of being stubborn about it.  I felt like this experience made me a better person.  It made me think that everyone makes mistakes, and for once, i'm able to come to terms with everything, admit my fault, and try to make things right in the future.  To some, this might not mean anything, but to me, it is such a big change.  A big, mature change.  I am so glad to have those people in my life, and to think about throwing that all away, and the bond I have with them, well, it just pretty much breaks my heart.  Everything is said and done now, and i'm happy once again.  So i'm sorry to the ones that i've wronged, or how I have not caused a happy moment, smile, or laugh in your life in the last 72 hours.  

School is really stressing me out.  Grant it i'm getting pretty good grades thusfar.  I'm just so burnt out once again.  It's a vicious cycle that needs to hurry up and give me a break.  Fall break...here I come.  Nothing too exciting.  I'm going to Kentucky to see all my cousins, go horseback riding, 4 wheeling, all the things that I do when i'm home.  Even though I was not born in Ky, I refer to Kentucky as my home, because it's where I grew up in a sense, and for me, Indiana has never actually given me the ""home-like"" feel as where the Scofield family is.  

On to other the signifiant other issue.  Yes, I have a boyfriend, contrary to popular belief.  I know, who would of thought, me, Dominique Marie Scofield, to have a boyfriend.  But yet, I do.  I met him through a sorority sister's boyfriend, whom I am also very good friends with as well.  I am so thankful, because Luke (my bf) and I seem to have many things in common, and he's an architecture major.  No, I am not referring to how much money they eventually could make, I am referring to the fact that Luke does not require 24/7 of my time, which is why i'm a bit more hopeful of this relationship than most.  I always need my space, I need to feel like i'm being independant, and that I can always support myself no matter what.  I do not want to be this domesticated trophy wife woman who does nothing but make herself look good and read intellectual books.  I want to make something of myself, and make a name for myself.  Wow.  I just kind of got off on a tangent, sorry.  Anyone ever feel like they've met ""the one""?  Odd question, I know.  I never truely believed anyone who said that...because i'm normally a firm believer of, ""you need to know someone a great deal, and for a long period of time before you can love them, or consider them 'the one'.""  Now, I don't know if this is true.  I know...I sound so cliche, and could just be going off infatuation.  I'm really not implying anything by that previous statement, just really looking for people's responses.  

On to another topic, which is living with my dad.  I am totally ready to move out now.  I know that financially I cannot afford it, do not want to try to afford it, and it will crush my dad into little pieces.  I know I will not move out until I go to grad/law school.  I just hate it sometimes, because I want roomates, I want to live by myself, have me, alone time.  I want to be able to have boyfriends sleep over if I want.  That's pretty much the only rule I have here, but still.  Sometimes, you just want to do whatever you want to do.  Most of you know, or have at some point met my dad, and he is one of the most wonderful, strong individuals you will ever meet.  He is so outgoing, and happy, pretty much identical to me, except in the male form.  I don't know really what i'm trying to write about here.

I'm taking my best guy friend to Barn Dance.  He's pretty much amazing, but no he is NOT my boyfriend.  Everyone assumes that for some reason, when omgoodness...Skyler is so far from being my boyfriend, or anything of the sort.  I love that kid, because he's pretty much family, since i've known him since he was 8, and I was 11, I do believe.  I don't know why i'm randomly blurting all this out either, i'm just sick of studying, and wanted to write.  I'll probably post a song lyric on here a bit later, just because I can.  

I hope everyone has a wonderful night, and hope they are accomplishing everything they need to this week.  If not, keep your head up, and stay strong.  The only direction things can go is up."

All you crazy people come on jump around 
You doing anything to keep her by your side 
Because she said she love you, love you long time

"event","I don't know why i've been down so lately.  All my life consists of is working two jobs, classes, and Pi Phi.  No me time, nothing.  I understand that I put everything on myself, i'm just so stressed out, really.  I don't know when i'm going to graduate, I don't know where i'm going to do my internship, I wish I was smarter, I wish I looked different, I miss my mama to PIECES, I wish I wasn't so tired all the time, and I wish that I could just cry and cry on someone's shoulder, and them not think i'm a lunitic.  I get like this sometimes, where it's too much to handle.  I know it's a lot.  People always come to me with their problems, and I always help them out.  I hate being a burden on people, and not being the normal happy cheery person I am.  I'm afraid i'm going to bring people down.  I don't know.  What I need?  Is to destress, something to get my frusteration out, and I won't stop for a very long time!!!"

"event","You know what I don't get?  Immature, irresponsible, clingy guys.  I mean seriously. My boyfriend and I broke up the other day, because he simply doesn't not understand my busy schedule.  I am a very busy person, do not want to spend every waking moment with my signifiant moment.  I mean, spending the night, spending days together is one thing....but not ALL day.  You have to have your space.  You have to have time to do your own thing.  I am probably never destined to find that ""special someone"" because I am just so damn paranoid, really.  I mean, I graduate in a year, I plan on moving south to a law school, so why would I want to be in a relationship?  Good question.  No answer.  For once I would love to have a complete gentleman who would open a car door for me (not every time...just sometimes), someone who didn't always try to make me jealous (if you know me, I am FAR from a jealous person!), someone who did not constantly brag about how much other women hit on him, and someone who would occasionally ask you out on a old fashioned date, and actually pay.  I'm not saying i'm this materialistic female who thinks guys should do everything in their power for a female.  I think all this negativity is stemming from I have never, in all the relationships i've been in, have a guy actually treat me like a lady, and who took me out once in awhile for dinner and/or a movie.  If someone did that, I would TOTALLY be estatic!!  When time goes on, I think that the couple should take turns taking each other out, but not in the very beginning.  Or how about having an intellectual conversation for once...not about sports?  I love sports as well as the next person, but I do like to converse about other topics such as current events, politics, religion, whatever really.  I know i'm being a bit dramatic, but i'm just so sick of the bullshit.  I'm so sick of my friends being in these bullshit relationships that they are treated like shit.  Guys and girls alike.  I think that once you find that ""special"" person, you should hold tight, and do everything you can to make it work.  I'm sick of putting up with people's bullshit.  I'm sick of people constantly analyzing my behavior within relationships because of my past.  My past is my past, and nothing will change it, and I wouldn't change it for the world.  I wish people would fully recongize that you should take people how they are, and not try to change or judge them for who they are and what they have done.  I'm sorry i'm just ranting and raving, but this is my light at the end of the tunnel kind of post, something to put my entire heart and soul into.  

On to another note...Kenny Chesney concert tomorrow night!! I have been waiting for this for a YEAR!! I bought tickets right when they went on sale, and have been counting down the days until I see him on stage :)  I'm so flipping excited.  

School is a bitch like always.  Too much time, too much homework.  It will get worse in law school, but i'm not ready to mold myself into that chapter of my life just yet.  

Thanks y'all if you're still reading this.  Kudos to you.  And if you didn't read it to the end, boo for you.  Have a good night!!"

"event","So I haven't really updated much lately.  It's summer, and I've just been living it to the fullest really, being lazy at times, and working all of my three jobs trying to get myself out of debt.  The debt thing is not coming so hot, but at this point in time, who the hell cares?  I do have a wonderful boyfriend now named Logan who loves to spend time with me, and my friends, calls me beautiful every single day of my life, and cares about me very much.  And I care about him as well :) He's a good kid that doesn't drink, smoke, but yet is still a sober ride with his girlfriend gets totally wasted @ the bars :) haha.  I'm pretty much robbing the cradle though, cause he's --------don't laugh----------- 19 years old. As in he's not turning 20 till Feburary 4th.  Yep.  haha.  But does age really matter?  I don't think so.  He's very mature for his age, and you don't cross that very often with guys unless they're 55 years old haha.  

School starts in a month, and i'm a little apprehensive about it as well. I have no idea how i'm going to handle being in Pi Phi, working two jobs, AND take 18 credit hours w/o getting horrible grades.  We'll see how it goes.  Maybe i'll just work on weekends?  I'm not sure yet.  We'll see how it goes.  

My dad and I have been somewhat cranky with each other as of lately.  He despises the fact that I have a boyfriend, and thinks i'm going to break up with him when school starts.  I told him i'm happy at this point in time, and he should be happy for me, and yet, he just gets crankier.  He's also convinced i'm having sex with Logan already, and we have done nothing of the sort, or anything close to it! We strictly stick to making out as this point in time.  I just wish my dad would let go sometimes and let me live my life, and not try to be so judgemental sometimes.  I've been single for almost two years now, so for me, i've had enough of the ""single irresponsible life.""  I'm not saying everyone who is single is irresponsible, but I was, and with a boyfriend, you can't just go out and makeout, mess around, or have sex with anyone you please.  Ugh.  My dad just frusterates the hell out of me sometimes.  And he also wants me to get another job, which would make four jobs, and I just cannot handle that many.  It's too much!!!

Well, i'm done venting/posting now.  Everyone have a good day!"

I work three jobs, which keep me pretty busy.  I work at Hollywood Video, Charlotte Russe, and at Ball State.  I pretty much need money like woah!  I hate just sitting around.  This has been my first summer since freshman year that I haven't had summer classes.  I mean, I took them first summer session, but I'm glad i'm not taking any this session.  I can have a break before school starts with massive homework, studying, Pi Phi stuff, so on and so on.  Although all of my friends have went home, so I don't hang out with anyone, and my best friend is going through a lot of family issues right now, so she's not around at all.

"event","I just want to start off with saying i'm fairly drugged from my visit to the gyno today.  They found cancerous cells in my cervix, and are taking many many painful procedures to make sure that I will be alright in the long run.  So I apologize up front for the spelling errors, or gramatical errors as well.  

I feel like I have to post this.  I have very very strong feelings about a specific article that I just read.  I actually read it from Jackie's post, and I was horrified at just how females in today's society actually feels about certain issues, and one big issue in particular is greek life.  

Here is the link:
http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10464110/sex__scandal_at_duke/4

It is pretty lengthy, so make sure when you read this, that you have a few minutes to read it in it's entirity (sp?).  This article speaks the truth about various greeks in the United States.  That point I will not argue.  But I do not necessarily feel that this article pertains to all greeks.  I am also not stating that in any way is the author applying it to all females who are/were greek.  But I feel like that when people read this article, it is one more reason for non-greek individuals to once again critize our lifestyles, even if we do not lead the sexual, alcohol-induced lifestyle that this article portrays.  Now, I have my ""stories"" where I have had sexual alcohol-induced situations.  But it is strictly ""stories"".  Not a lifestyle.  I know that the BSU greek life is completely different than other campuses, but I am not going to downgrade our system and critize it.  We have not had any hazing deaths at BSU in a long time, if not ever ( I am not sure if this has EVER happened, but it has not happened recently.)  I know for a fact that sororities and fraternities still haze to a certain extent, but not to the level that other chapters do, or if so, they are extremely cautious about the situations.  I just get very outraged when one chapter, especially from a completely different university, which happens to be in North Carolina, will make individuals within society who label themselves ""non-greek""  feel that we live this extravagant lifestyles where mommy and daddy pay for everything, including our bar tabs, our real Louis Vuitton luggage, and Chanel outfits.  I can honestly say that my mommy and daddy are not wealthy, I live with just my dad, and we are comfortable, but not wealthy.  Not even close.  My daddy does not buy me everything I want, and if I told him I wanted a Louis Vuitton purse that had a retail value of $812.00, he would laugh hysterically at me, and say get real.  I know I lead a different lifestyle than most, because most traditional students do not work, mom and dad pay for everything, or loans pay for everything, including their bar tabs.  I'm not saying that just because someone doesn't work means they are stuck up snobs.  I'm just saying I wish the word ""sterotyping"" did not exist.  I wish the concept did not exist.  I know that is a world of dreams, and that we are living in reality, but in our reality, we can vent, and I am choosing to vent about sterotyping, and how stupid some women can be for actually believing that they are ""lucky"" to be with someone, that they look beautiful, and are intellegent, yet they stoop down to a stripper hooker level, dress up as playboy bunnies for a hazing ceremony, and spread chocolate syrup over their breasts, and call themselves ""lucky"" for even being INVITED to that hazing ritual.  Ugh.  That's all I have to say about that.  It's degrading, really.

I have to go to work at 5pm.  I'm hoping that i'm still not drugged.  I'm not allowed to drive anywhere, or anything.  Bleck. I hate the drugs the doctors give you.  It makes me feel all woozy inside.  Well, I'm going to go sleep now.  Everyone, feel free to post your thoughts on this article.  I would love to hear everyone's different thoughts and opinions on it. Thanks Jackie for posting this!"

"event","So my life has been pretty hectic here lately.  I go to classes, do all my homework, study an insane amount for my exams, work out at the gym in between my classes, look for jobs in the same day, and help take care of my dad when he's sick from the radiation.  I think that has to be the most difficult.  For example, yesterday, he came home from radiation, and said he felt fine.  All of a sudden, he just started dry heaving, eventually just vomiting everywhere.  Poor guy.  He couldn't even make it to the toilet in time, because it just happened.  And he cannot eat, so nothing is in his stomach.  I know this is somewhat graphic, but he said that he was still throwing up stuff, even though he has not ate in like three days.  It's just burnt stuff.  I'm assuming, it's particles from his stomach, and the burnt taste is from the radiation treatments, because in essence, that is what it is doing to the body.  Burning the insides.  I cannot even fathom how difficult to see the person you love most go through that.  It hurts so bad that eventually you will lose your beloved parents, and you will no longer be able to call them for advice, ask them for help when you're trying to fix some household problem, ect.  I know my dad isn't going to die, but it's just the initial thought that eventually he will.  Reality actually hit me, and made me realize we will not be able to have our parents in our life for eternity.  Don't take this as a sad, meloncholy entry.  I am actually very positive and hopeful, I just wanted to tell everyone that no matter how much you argue and fight with your parents, they will not be here forever, so you must cherish the time you have left with them.  I know when I wake up everyday, I am so lucky to see my dad walking and enjoying his best years of his life.  

School is going pretty well so far.  I have had two exams in my pols class, and the first one, I bombed with a 68%.  But I took one today, and I feel like I did incredible on it.  Hopefully my gut instinct is correct!  I also had a take home exam in my criminal evidence class.  Dr. Ho's tests suck hardcore, because they are so long (20-25 PAGES for TWO questions).  We have to type everything out, and when I was finished, I had 12 pages of information I turned in for the exam.  It is an extremely difficult course, but I learn so much from Dr. Ho's courses.  He has a different teaching approach, and makes us apply what we learn to different scenaros, and even real life cases.  We have already debriefed the O.J. Simpson case, the Kobe Bryant case, Maryland v. Craig, the Scott Peterson case, and several more.  I have learned more in Dr. Ho's classes than I have in my entire undergraduate career at Ball State University.  Which is  good thing, somewhat, but a bad thing as well.  

I cannot wait until school is just over.  Then I can concentrate on studying for the LSATs (for admission to law school), working out hardcore, and working somewhere.  It will be nice to just not have to worry about getting up at 6am to study for an exam that is at 9:15am.  Or go to bed late if you have the next day off.  I just cannot wait!! :)  I am here all summer, so if anyone wants to hang out, please call me!! I miss people and get so lonely!!!BTW...Emily, I do not have your number.  I forgot to get it in a drunken stupor at BDubs!! haha!!  Well, i'm peacing out.  Everyone have a fabulous day!!!xoxo :)"

"event","So this week has been very good so far.  I worked Monday and Tuesday.  Dad had his surgery on Monday, and it went well.  We find out on Monday if he needs to do chemo, or radiation, or either.  Nana is here helping take care of him, and it's driving me crazy!! HAHA.  I'm used to just me and my dad.  Although, I have been working out everyday for at least an hour, if not two.  I have been watching what I eat, portioning out EVERYTHING and only eating 2-3 meals a day, healthy ones.  No fast food.  No eating out.  And no drinking :(.  I will drink occasionally this summer, but I have to big of a desire to be thin.  I have such a complex about my image.  I graduated high school wearing a 3/5 or 5/6, and now, i'm up to 11/12.  I feel disgusting.  It's time to be little again.  And it's going to take some serious discipline, and some serious working out, but hopefully I can do it.  I do not want to be ripped, just thin again.  no HUGE lovehandles.  I can handle itty bitty ones, and even a slight pooch.  But no more of what I have now.  Do y'all think it's possible?  I do a lot of cardio, at least an hour a day, so hopefully it will help!!  

School starts on Monday and i'm slightly nervous.  I'm taking two very difficult courses, one being criminal evidence, and the other being my stats class for political science.  Ugh.  Hopefully I do well, so I can keep raising my gpa.  I raised it this time, and had the highest gpa i've ever had at BSU!! It doesn't compare to Miss Amanda's cause she's one of the smartest people I know :), but I'm still proud of myself :) So hopefully summer will do me some good!!  I'm all about working out, school, and that's it.  I'm only working two days a week at the Bingo hall, and that's all I plan on working.  For once in my life, i'm going to have a summer :)  And i'm so excited about it!!!  

I'm very scared about something as well.  I went to the gyno a couple of weeks ago, and my tests came back.  I have abnormal cells.  I have to go back on June 15 and have something called a colipstropsy (sp?) where they go in, and remove cells, and scrape and such, and they will also do a biopsy to see if I have cancer.  I am absolutely terrified.  First my dad, they possibly me?  I don't know if I can handle my dad having cancer, and then myself.  So please keep my dad and I in your thoughts/prayers.  I'm extremely nervous.  

I think that's about it.  I haven't updated in a long while, so I thought it was about time to recap some happy thoughts :) Night y'all!"

I am getting all Cs and maybe Bs...but that's not good enought for them.  :( it will devistate me...but maybe it's for the best.  HEll if i know.  By the way all, my dad was judst diagonisised w/ cancer.  testicular cancer.  hence why i'm drunk right now....i am devistated.  and even though i love pi phi so much, my grades have suffered bc i have not concentarated on my finals like i should.  i'm crying all the time.  not eating.  crying hysterically.  i'm a mess.  so i really don't give a fuck about anything but my dad LIVING.  Competing with live, basically.  I do not want a pity party.  my pi phis have helped me live thought this.  so even if i'm not a sister anymore cause of my grades, i will always still be a sister, and will always love my daddy.  sad entry i know.  drunk entry i know.  i've been crying for 2hrs....i need to stop.  and stop drinking alcohol. Why?  bc no one's here and i'm real sad.  real sad."

Champagne High

I wasn't looking for a lifetime with you 
And I never thought it would hurt just to hear 
""I do"" and ""I do"" 
And I do a number on myself 
And all that I thought to be 
And you'll be the one 
That just left me undone 
By my own, hesitation 

Bridge 
and for the million hours that we were 
well I'll smile and remember it all 
then I'll turn and go 
while your story's completed mine is a long way from done. 

Chorus 
Well I'm on a champagne high 
Where will I be when I stop wondering why 
On a champagne high 
I'd toast to the future but that'd be a lie 
On a champagne high, high 

Spring turned to summer 
But then winter turned to mean 
The distance seemed right 
At the time it was best - to leave 
And to leave behind 
What I once thought was fine And so real - to me 
And while I'm still gone 
On the quest for my song 
I'm at your - celebration 

Bridge & Chorus 

Your wagons been hitched to a star 
Well now he'll be your thing that's new 
Yeah what little I have you can borrow 
'Cause I'm old and I'm blue... 

Bridge 

Well I'm on a champagne high (so high) 
Where will I be when I stop wondering why 
On a champagne high (so high) 
Toast to the future but that'd be a lie 
On a champagne high 
Where will I be when I stop wondering why 
On a champagne high...high... 
So high so high you left me undone 
so high, so high you left me undone...


*so I cannot fall asleep after pulling two all nighters in a row.  I'm so stressed, and I have no idea how people are so intellegent sometimes.  It takes everything I have to be average.  And it takes some people almost nothing to achieve perfection.  I hate it.  I'm sorry for writing in here when i'm stressed/sad/mad/lonely, whatev.  It helps me.  Y'all know i'm a happy person for the most part.  But i'm ready for a relationship.  I'm ready to love someone, and take them into my heart.  And take care of them.  And for them to take care of me, and hold me when i'm stressed and sad.  Sometimes I get really scared i'll never find anyone.  Maybe i broke too many hearts when I was a bit younger.  Who knows?  I'm ready for something new...something exciting.  I also wish my Tyler would come home.  He's in Iraq right now, and I do not have his address or anything.  If anyone happens to know how to get their addresses, let me know.  I miss him terribly.  He's one of my bestest guy friends.  He IMed me the other day to let me know he was alright.  That was the end of it though.  Well, i'm out.  Hopefully I can get some sleep."

I love it almost as much as the play...and I am also currently reading the book as well!! :)  Well, i'm out! y'all make sure to set your clocks tonight for daylight savings time BS....love you all!!"

"event","Okay....i am seriously hardcore angry.  One of my sisters just is so disrespectful to me.  I never do anything to her, she is just very judgemental, and I started actually standing up for myself, and she hates it.  I mean, Spring Break literally tore us apart, and I just feel completely and utterly crazy when i'm around her.  She makes me feel worthless, she thinks i'm completely fake, and I really am not.  Am I happy, and cheery...sickening at times? Sure.  But at least i'm not a bitch.  I NEVER am mean to anyone, I don't get involved with drama, yet somehow, me and this person always has tension b/w us.  And the problem is, a lot of the sisters like her, which is COMPLETELY fine, but they feel like I do.  They feel this person is not very tactful and classy, and thinks she could handle confronting situations a lot better.  I don't understand why people are so intimidated by her.  RAR.  I was so pissed off tonight, I was shaking and just burst into tears.  I can't take this person for very much longer.  I feel like none of the sisters understand me anymore.  I mean honestly.  I feel like they're damn good for going out and drinking...but when I honestly need someone...there's no one left standing.  I am so devistated and hurt by this.  I am going through a lot right now, and would love it if someone would become close with me, and let me confide.  I mean, I don't have HUGE problems compared to others, but they're important to me.  Maybe it's just me.  Maybe I really am this fake person, that I don't know about.  I mean, I don't think i'm a bitch and fake.  But If I am, I would love it if someone would inform me of this.  I mean, I would be crushed if ppl thought of me like that, and would try to change that immediately.  Gosh...this night is just not swell.  Thank you all for listening.  And anything you read, stays between us."

4. What is your all time favorite movie? Legally Blonde I and II...ALWAYS puts me in a better mood

5. Do you believe in ghosts? no

6. Do you consider yourself creative? not really.  Sometimes
7. Do you think O.J. killed his wife? All the evidence points to yes....so yes

8. Jennifer Aniston or Angelina Jolie? Algelina.  Why you ask?  Because she is beautiful, and not psychotic like Jennifer.  I like Jenn and all...but I mean, come on..

9. Can you honestly say you know ANYTHING about politics? Well, political science is my minor...

10. Do you know how to play poker? I don't know how to play uker...or however you spell it.  

11. Have you ever been awake for 48 hours straight? yes.  It is absolutely HELL.  Damn college. 

12. What's your favorite commercial? The old pepsi commercial w/ Britney Spears.  I just love it.  

13. Who was your first love? Ugh.  Mr. Stephen Delk.  The whole relationship taught me a lot.  Made me realize that I needed to grow up, and not be entirely consumed with someone.  

14. If you're driving in the middle of the night, and no one is around you, do you run a red light? hell no.  Cops are everywhere.

15. Do you have a secret that no one knows but you? Yes.

16. Boston Red Sox or New York Yankees? Yankees if I had to choose one.  I'm really not into baseball teams.  I like to watch it.  I like to play it. And I like to watch baseball players play...but to say a favorite team...i dunno.

17. Have you ever been Ice Skating? I can't even roller skate

18. How often do you remember your dreams? I have weird ass dreams.  So sometimes i remember, sometimes I don't.  My people in my dreams do not have faces.  And I dream in color.

20. Can you name 5 Beatles songs.
No, I don't think so

21. What's the one thing on your mind? how fucking immature people are,even if they're 21 years old.  How I can't believe someone thinks i'm ""fake"" when the person is completely judgemental, and in their ""religious"" world..I mean, i'm religious, but I do NOT judge people.  Why? I'd be a hypocrite....I just mainly think this person is a bitch.  And...I need to have sex soooooonnn 

22. Do you believe in love at first sight? Nope.  The sparks might be there...but it takes time to fall in love with someone.

27. Have you ever narrowly avoided a fatal accident? uh....no?

28. What do you wear to bed? a oversized tshirt.  That's it.  

30. Does size matter? It just depends.  It doesn't matter if the guy can make it up in other ways, aka help you reach orgasm by other means.  If he doesn't, it just means he's selfish, and then yes, it matters.  

31. Do you truly hate anyone? yes.  One person.  

32. Rock or Rap? rap

39. Have you ever made fun of your friends behind their back? no..if you're my friend, i don't talk shit.

"event","This weekend has been a blast!! Thursday night was Alexis's birthday...21st at that...so we celebrated :)  Friday night, I went to a Sig Ep party, and at first, I was so out of place, because i'm not blonde and a size zero.  No, seriously...I didn't not see ONE brunette until late late that night.  Crazy.  Then Matney, Steph, Wiley, and Alise all came, and that made it so much better.  Crazy as well, but better.  Saturday I just had a chill night, but it was so worth it, and well deserved.  

On friday, my good friend, and one of my exes, Sean Cox, texted me because he saw me driving on Tillotsen.  He goes to IU, but had a Dr. appt here, so was in Muncie for the day.  I normally cannot STAND this kid, we just have tempers somewhat, but we always end up talking no matter what the situation.  I hate liking this kid so much, but i'm just drawn to him for some odd and strange reason. And he calls me Mami...which is odd...but strangly cute as well... Hmm...

And by the way...my 21st birthday is in exactly TWO days...yes you read that right....2!!  I've been to the bars many many times before, but I finally will be in the loop, and able to do w/e anyone else does.  I'm a lil WAY excited for that...and I will be in South Padre, TX in exactly four days!!! I'm stoked!!! Well, that's my update for now."

I finally have a job.  AT MOES!  WELCOME TO MOES!!  So seriously stop by and see it.   YOu know I've finally figured out that don't sit and wait around for a guy that's obbsessed and totally not aware of what he could have because he is to busy being upset about what he doesn't have or being to obsessed over a girl who either doesn't like him or likes him but doesn't want a relationship.  I think me finally realizing that made my life a little better.  You know I'm thinking about changing my entire out look and self image.   Its going to be interesting.  Neways..ttyl.  Muchos love.

Then I came home and showered and Tommy and I talked on the phone twice for a long time...and I appreciated it so much cuz if you know tommy and I at first we didn't have that great of phone conversations so this means they are actually getting better.  

Then I went to caiti's house and hung out with caiti, tommy, sam, and Kathy.   We had publix and starbucks adventures .....with some weird guy named chris.  The only cool thing about him is that he plays clarinet.  Then we came back to caiti's house and kathy left.  Tommy and caiti went off talking and sam and I talked about relationships and boyfriends.....then sam jokingly said i'm going to walk home and I jokingly ran after her missing the curb with one foot and falling on my left foot....It hurt really bad...its not broken ...but I think i pulled a muscle....well I don't think its broken.    It did swell last night...but it isn't that bad this morning...i just can't put pressure on it.  Well I have to go clean....ttyl...bye."

So I just got back from a wonderful time in Tampa with allison and the horse gang!  We went to Busch Gardens on the 5th of July and Then I left early to go have that pill done.  Then I came back on Thursday night and on Friday I got to watch my sister show some more.  Then on Saturday I went to Busch Gardens again with allison, Rebecca, and her friend Becky.   On Saturday  at busch gardens we got to ride sheikra like 3 times in a row because no lie there was no line.  Then we rode Gwazi, then Congo River rapids and allison and I were the only people that got soaked because some guy shot allison head on with a water gun that you can shoot people with for 25 cents.   I was sitting next to her so I got some of it.   I mostly got hit by giant waves.   Then we rode on Kumba, then montu, then the ski ride, then the train.   Allison and I got tossed a teddy bear from this random guy so it was funny .  Allison also got 10 dollars from this lady for food.  It was awesome.  I wish I got ten dollars for food.  but it was cool.   Then we shopped for a while.  Tommy called us so we talked with him on the phone for a while and he explained how he is co captain of the bass line now and not captain of the cymbals which made him sad.   

So allison and I both thought that we needed to get a way for a while and I think that this trip was exactly what we needed.   I just wish Tommy was there to hang with us, but he made a promise to sam so i'm glad that he kept even though it kind of hurt my feelings at first....but not anymore....i'm glad he got to spend time with Sam on her birthday.  I just wish I was there to hang with her on her birthday too.    But basically that's how my exciting trip went.    

TTYL.  BYe.

If you want to hang or something call the cell.

I am not allowed to be 10 ft. near any electromagnetic device....which includes my ipod, the radio, the microwave, or stuff like that.   I am not allowed to have anything solid to eat after lunch the day before...then at 10 o clock i'm not allowed to have anything...then I can't have anything to drink until 2 hours after swallowing the pill and I can't have anything to eat 4 hours swallowing the pill.  I am really not excited about doing this at all...so wish me luck.  

Anyways......Idk......emotional rollercoaster is taking place...today...a lot...I gave tommy advice and he hasn't said anything about it. ....so I'm not sure if he liked it that much or not.

Wow you guys have no idea how happy I am since the one guy that i really like has come back into my life.

Anyways....ummm....just waiting for people to get up and call me cuz I would like to hang out sometime.  I can't wait till Busch gardens...Its going to be so much fun.  

So I think I'm going with Tommy to go see Sam when her plane flies in but i'm not sure yet....I would have to talk to my parents about it.  Mostly my dad because he would say yes more than my mom would.  Its good to know these things.  

Well I think I helped Tommy last night by listening to what he had to say.  Well I atleast hope I did.  He sure did help me on what I should do about the whole maxx situation.  Well TTYL.  Time for breakfast. 

Please call so I have someone to hang out with ...."

I thought that maxx was a friend of mine but after talking to him and robert like tommy said to I found out that he didn't even consider me his friend since we broke up which was in eighth grade.  I feel so retarded and embarassed.   


Life sucks right now.  I just lost two friends who I thought were good friends of mine...but I guess I was wrong.  Man I wish I could just run away from here and leave everything behind and start over.   That would make my life easier.  I feel like everyone is going to leave me.  Well at least I can count on the callorys and my husband/father tommy!  whom I <3 very much.  well ttyl."

NMHJC...

Anyways...Caiti tommy and sam hung out at my house for a couple minutes and we watched charlie in the chocolate factory....before that we went to the mall and saw allison....we were going to see a movie but sam left her wallet at home.....it was quite an adventure....tommy thought he lost his keys and they ended up being in his car....that was quite nerve racking i'm sure.....
and that's really all that happened yesterday....

Today I just got back from the doctor getting a physical for track and in case I decide to do cross country..but at the moment it looks like tommy would have to be dragging me to practice to get me to go....

Now i'm just waiting to go hang out with sam, maybe caiti, and maybe tommy.....


Sorry  guys for acting so upset yesterday...I was just thinking alot about a certain someone.......

anyways...call the cellular....

I'M ALLOWED TO EAT FOOD NOW!!!!"

I know its been awhile since I have updated so this might be a long post or it might not...i'm not sure yet.  lol.

Anyways....ummm....Tommy was over a couple nights ago with allison and I...and we just hung out.....It was fun....we ended up watching signs and then tommy's parents called and said he had to go home..but he said he had to finish the movie even though there wasn't one and got to say 45 minutes longer then he turned his phone on vibrate and ended up staying till like 12 35 or something like that.  So he stayed the night at my house basically.  

Then last night Tommy was over for a little bit and we watched O brother where out thou (sp)  That is a pretty great movie. Then we went in my room and talked a little bit....then he had to leave...then I called him to ask him a question and we ended up talking on the phone till like 1 in the morning....I felt so useless...cuz I couldn't help him with what he is going through right now.  I felt so unhelpful....it made me really sad.  

Then finally what I did today.  

I went to the lake house for our 4-h party.  It was really fun.   I got sunburned on my face though so that kind of hurts.  Other than that it was good.  Now I'm just hanging at home...waiting for people to call if they want to do anything.  

Update on hospital stuff....

right now i'm on a liquid diet so I can only have liquid food....which really sucks.....

Then on the 6 of July I go to the hospital and swallow a camera that is inside a pill...and it will download pictures to a belt that I have to wear for 8 hours...so I am totally not looking forward to that.....and after that my doctor will look at them and we will see what we are going to do from there....

well if you want to hang out ...call the cellular.
You know the number!

Just got back from the hospital.....still wearing my hospital bracelet...lol.

Anyways.....I am kind of nervous about finding out the tests results just because the doctors looked kind of concerned today.

I will know tomorrow.

I guess I am more scared than nervous....so me saying i'm scared is probably more truthful than me saying i'm nervous.....


Anyways...if you want to hang out ...give me a call

Anyways.....I feel like I have been a boring person lately....especially...I have been boring my friends...like tommy....I think I am boring him alot ......

So...I'm sorry....and don't worry about hanging out with me....its ok.....


I am going to go....maybe I will hangout with allison...today when i get back from the doctor.....she is the only one....I think....that doesn't think i'm boring....

but as far as I know....I am pretty sure when Tommy and I hang out ....he probably thinks i'm the most boringest person ever.  


well ttyl...

"event","so not much has happend today, as you read in my last post. but I wrote a poem and I am not a poetic person so please dont laugh! I all the sudden got inspired!


Tears of rage stream down my face
With you I though I dit the ace.
I was wrong and so were you.

You used me and led me on like a fool
so pick your usless self up and get over you
because now I see the real person I wanted
and I am over you too. Now youre the fool.
 
Ugh I have been depressed lately but all the sudden this afternoon my days got better!! S now I am happy!! But I have to go!! for now!! pleasae comment"

"event","UGH!! It makse me angry how imature people can be sometimes. and also how nosy!! The last thing I need is somebody stuck up my butt telling me what to do!! i already get that from my parents!! But not much has happened!! other than there is this girl I really dont like hanging around me and I dont know how to tell her to go away. ugh!!! Why do I have to be one of those people who have a hard time telling people how I feel about them to their face?? And also I am sorry if I have ever said anything to anybody that hurt their feelings because I really didnt mean it! I cant hurt somebody's feelings without meaning to at all! But, if they wouldnt eaves drop and thnk everything I have to say is about them their feelings prob wouldnt be hurt right now! So if they want to be all grippy and mean to me I can be twice as mean!! well I really gotta go. but I'll update tommorrow!"

Seth has had a really bad week! he seems really depressed lately.Oh Micah was a student teacher for our class today and it was freaking fun! He was so much fun! But he kinda embarassed me but i dont really care because i would have laughed had somebody else had it happen to them. Micah was making me read a paragraph and he said read louder, then read faster and eventually my tounge got all tied up and my gum fell out of my mouth and hit the floor!! And of course everybody was watching and most people about fell out of their chairs laughing! lol well I gotta go i think the bell is about to ring!"

"event","whoa. it's been a while since i last updated. much has happend since. first off, i went to the philippines and japan for almost three weeks. it was a good trip. but a long time away from home. the philippines was a bit of a culture shock. there's so much poverty that i'm not used to seeing everyday. during my stay, i wondered what those people would think of our culture. just one of my curioues thoughts. but besides the squatters along the highways and everywhere, we also went to a beautiful island called boracay. white sand. clear blue water. and a hotel room that opens up to the beach. what more can you ask for? japan was another story. it was a lot cleaner and upper scale. tokyo is like new york city but cleaner and more modern. during the trip i picked up a copy of Lullaby, and read most of it during the trip and finished when i got home. it was good book.

i'm trying to get into reading more. a few days ago, jill lent me The Perks of Being a Wallflower, which i do enjoy. i'm almost done with it.

a couple weeks ago was warped tour. the fourth one i've gone too and i must say i had a good time. i went with erika, jill, brian and dan. and met up with arthus, tom kaiser, kao and other kids. i saw motion city soundtrack, coheed, piebald, tbs, underoath. and some other bands. they were all good especially motion city and underoath. tbs isn't may favorite band live. they have good music but they kind of suck live.

thats all i shall right."

"event","oo man. summer rocks. went thrifting for the first time on long island, last week with jill and erika. it was a fun time. i got a pair of toight diesel pants for $20 bucks. aww yeah. and a sweet flanel shirt for about $3. after that i had my first experience of checkers. ooo man, that was good stuff. later we went to the battle of the bands at sports plus. it was ok.

friday was that crazy 40 man poker tournament. it was a fun time. i made it to the final 8. i didn't think i would make it that far.

saturday watched, dodgeball for the second time with erika and jill and some kid brendan. it was a good movie. those girls are fun to hang out with.

yesterday was fourth of july. went to west hamptons with erika, jill, justine, kait, kyle, matt, brian and kevin. that was a really fun day. swimming in the ocean, matt's bush floating all over the place, jill drowning every 2 seconds, 711, drunk chicks yelling 'i love you', fireworks, showers with everyone, swimming late at night. oo man it was a good time.

going out with erica and her cousin tonight. should be a fun time. i hope everyones enjoying their summer. peace lata."

"event","mmm. the last full week of school is over. it still doesn't really feel like summer though. don't know why. one day left and four tests to take woohoo. i'm not going to lie, i'm not feeling so confident about these tests. especially calc. i'm realy hoping to get at least a B on it. and chem isn't looking to good. we've had all these practice things, but i didn't take any of them seriously. i've lost my motivation. we'll just have to see how i do.

hung out with erika and laura tonight. pretty fun, besides the driving across different towns. it's ok. i didn't mind. we had fun going gift shopping and such. it was a good night.

i'm thinking of having a party before i go away for almost 3 weeks, in july. that's a long time for me to be away from home. i'm probably going to get homesick too, which is going to suck. but yeah, if anyone wants to help plan a party, let me know.

past two days i've been in a good mood. long time since i've been in a good mood. i don't know why. actually i kind of do. but i won't share that part. i've done a lot of thinking and decided on things and i guess that has had a contribution to my good moodness. this school year is coming to the end and i so can't wait.

oh yeah in july i'm going away for almost 3 weeks. which is really long and i told my parents it's such a long time, but we're still going. we're going to the philippines. going all over the place over there and we're going to japan too. i'm hoping we stop by hawaii again, like the last time we went to the philippines. i want to go surfing again.

anywho, school is finally coming to an end and i can't wait anymore. 6? days left i believe. whatever. i just want summer to come now.

this week was mediocre (spelling?) the highlight has to be tie-dying shirts in chem. which wasn't all that crazy fun. but it was what i looked forward too this week. this morning i took the SATs once again, in central islip. man were they so so annoying. by the end of the test my head was throbbing with pain from thinking too much. it really sucked. but i think i did better this time. i won't get my hopes too high.

after that i hung around the house for a bit then watched harry potter with some kids. after that headed home, played online poker for a couple hours. then erika and laura came over for a little bit. met people at starbucks. came back to my house to play real poker. it was fun. then went to shepp jones which was totally not scary what so ever. that was pretty much it.

i'm sort of in a poopy mood now. i don't know why. i have a lot of emotions going through my mind. i don't know if i've been acting weird lately. if i am i probably don't know why. everything is still messed up and confusing. i wished it wasn't but i still need to think things out. i need to vent."

"event","pretty fun weekend. hung out with erika, jill, steve and kelly on saturday night. we went to the beach, wendy's and i drove them all around. pictures of sunset and what not. fun time. sunday night attempted to go to billy murphy's beach party with the kids, which never happened. we ended up going to wendy's but on the way everyone turned to go somewhere else which ended up having me sit at sevs in st.james all by myself. yes it did suck, but i didn't make a big deal about it. eventually we went to wendy's. saw matt walsh, dan kelly, justine and annie there. matt had a fog horn and drove to the drive thru and blew it. it was actually pretty funny. later some of us got carvel, then everyone came to my house. played poker for a bit then people left.

today we were planning to go to the hamptons but due to bad planning and communication we ended up not going. i woke up and went to get bagels with justine and kait. then went to best buy and bought modest mouse, frenz ferdinand and the postal service. got dvds, picked up matt, went to justine's house. burnt cds, played poker barely watched a movie. then the rest of my day sucked, sitting around.
now i'm here writing this entry. adios."

it's memorial weekend. i'm going to have fun. i'm calling it now. beaching it, hamptons possibly, kicking it with the kids.

saturday i worked, which sucked since we had a power outage for a while. things got caotic. went to prom later that night. it was pretty good i guess. i thought i'd enjoy it more. the night was good besides some stuff.

hamptons on sunday was fun. relaxed and had a good time. i very much enjoyed all the people that came. a few that i never hung out with, but still had a fun time with.

the weekend had it's ups and downs. i'm still upset about some stuff. but hopefully things will get better soon. i'm going to miss a lot of things, that i will never forget. so many good memories. i'm pretty bummed that something had to happen this weekend, but it was coming sooner or later.

"event","so yesterday was martucci's party. it was cool. walshes band played and they were really good. after that i went home and had a talk with nicole on the phone. it didn't turn out too nice. i won't get into full detail, but i'll say that after i hung up, i was upset and crying.(yes i'm human and i cry.) still being bothered i didn't get much sleep last night. i woke up a few times and wasn't able to fall asleep right away. this morning i still felt miserable. i went to work trying not to think about it. i'd say i lasted pretty well through work without breaking a tear, not even while cutting up some onions. i came home and i was still upset. i tried to get my mind off the whole thing by doing homework and stuff. but i still couldn't stop thinking about it. a few people talked to me today. even people i didn't expect to be there for me. it shows who i can count on to be there for me when i need them. thanks kait, justine, matt and erica. i appreciate it so much.

later i started to talk to nicole online and decided we should continue this conversation in person. so she came over and we talked, cried and laughed for over an hour. it was very emotional and overwhelming, but the outcome was more than expected. we were able to work things out. so now we're not on a break anymore nor are we sad anymore. it's good to be happy again.

i think this whole thing made me realize how much nicole means to me. i'm so glad we were able to work things out and that were able to do so. my day started off terrible and now i'm in such a good mood. i love nicole so much<3"

"event","so.. long time no entry. well i'll start from when i last updated. my birthday passes like almost 2 weeks ago. it was nice. i got to spend some time with nicole while she was stuck at home. that night i went out with kids and tried to convince brian to drive down shepp jones (the ""haunted"" road) in stonybrook. that sunday i went to a show at the downtown. i saw haste the day, dead poetic, underoath, beloved and norma jean. it was an awesome show. i went with brian and erika. and saw matt and jesse there. if you want to see pictures from it, i have some on my webshots. the following day i visited my nicole before i left for canada. then i left for canada the next day. on the way to toronto, we stopped by buffalo to say hello to my bro. we stayed at toronto for a couple days then drove to manotick, ottawa. later that same night we went to a place called mont tremblant, which is a ski resort and more. it was nice, but i didn't go skiing. i don't really like snow, or skiing. plus throughout the whole trip i was homesick. i missed nicole and everyone a lot. we had a lovely easter dinner at my aunts house in manotick, which was probably the nicest and one of the few family dinners we had. we came back monday night and had also brought my aunt mila from montreal. tuesday was mine and nicole's 4 month anniversary, which was very lovely. i'm really happy to be with her and i couldn't explain how much i care about her.

it's the start of the new quarter and i'm still going to try to do well in all of my classes. i think i improved in most of my classes 3rd quarter compared to my 2nd wuarter grades, except calculus which i think i might've gotten a C or D :/ i'm hoping for at least a C. anywho, that was a lot to write. bye."

the rest of my week was eventless. i only have two more classes of joyce benson and i'm glad, cause it makes my wednesdays suck. tomorrow is my brithday. that's right i'm  turning 17. i'm going to nicoles house after school and spending the afternoon with her, then i'm probably going out to dinner with a bunch of kids. it'll be a good time.

i think i'm going to a show on sunday. it's norma jean, dead poetic, beloved, haste the day and underoath. it should be kickass. that's it. bye."

anyways, today i went to nicoles. we watched family guy for a while, then matt brown's little bro, robbie, came over. he's a cute boy. later justine and kait came over. then brian came over a little later. we all watched family guy, sort of. kait a justine were playing spit. it was a good time.

"event","so last night was bands of the bull. it was alright. more people showed up than i expected. most of the bands were alright. one freshman band weren't bad, they need to practice more, but other than that i'd say they were pretty good. we played 8th. we did pretty well, i messed a few times, but unless you were really paying attention you probably didn't notice them.

after we played, a bunch of kids went to danielles house. nicole<3, jimmy, jenna, jordan, ryan, chris rosenman, chris cunningham and billy were all there. also matt and kim. it was good ol' time. jordan raided danielles underwear drawer (not really), but he did attempt too. and chester (danielles dog) licked rosenmans hairy ass. it was effing hilarious. it was a fun night.

worked today sucked cause it was busy. some kid cut his thumb and had to go to the hospital. good thing it was before we opened. it was pretty nasty. besides that, work wasn't too exciting.

(tony hawk's underground) it's a good game, i recommend it.

when i came back i went to the straylight run show. we also saw armor for sleep, moneen and days away. all awesome bands. todd from glassjaw came out during straylight, as well as jesse lacey from brand new. it was an awesome show spent with nicole, chris and justine.

new years was spent at lisa colavitos house. it was a good time. nicole and i owned at foosball. we only lost one game. i also got to play ben hartards pimp box, which is fucking awesome. played ninja turtles. awesome game.

i started working at quizno's on friday. it's not bad. the people there are pretty cool. i work with jameson, brian arthus and brian petshauer(spelling?) the food there is amazing. the sucky part is that i work fridays till 9:30 :(. 

monday was when we came back for vacation. it sucks being back at school. i have a 3 day week though, so thats cool. but i have to make up all the shit i missed which sucks. today i went to deca regionals which was in suffolk community college. justine and i were the only ones in our group that didn't place. it's alright though, we got honorable mention and we still have a chance of going to states with the same subject. tonight we may be going to baja to celebrate. w00t. tomorrow i'm going to the riverhead jail. thats going to be a fun day. friday is bands of the bull. i'm psyched but nervous, because ufn has only practiced once. we're playing 'great romances of the 20th century' bye taking back sunday, 'ok i believe you but my tommy gun don't' by brand new and a ufn original.

yeah that's about it. what a long entry that no one will read. i'm just testing this ish out. peace. i love nicole<3"

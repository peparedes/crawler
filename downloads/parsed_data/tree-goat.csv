"event","i have been sewing my fingers off all day, and yesterday as well. built by wendy has sewing patterns for sale and i bought them all. so far i have made a shirt and a dress, and i am really excited about making my own adjustments to the patterns. the dress and the shirt are both really true to the original pattern, but they are so simple to use that it will be easy and fun to make them more my own. it feels so good to make things, and once they are finished, it feels like i've accomplished something. which is always a great feeling. i wish i could post pictures but our damn camera is broken and we cant afford a new one yet. i'm really excited to make more things and maybe gifts for a specail few..

fun fun fun!! i love built by wendy!!"

"event","lillith is going to be four, in just over three weeks. it is crazy. i finally finished making all the invitations yesterday. i handed a few of then out last night at eclipse. i have really met some good people working there. people that i would never have met otherwise.

i have two goals to reach before the year is done. the first is to go to texas, which i am buying the ticket for on friday. the second is to go to sacramento. eric has been there for over a year now and i wanna go visit him before december. if i dont do it before then i probobly wont get a chance to. the holidays are always crazy and we are always dirt poor by the time they are over.

does anyone want to go to california with me?"

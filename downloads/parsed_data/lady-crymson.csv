Not lifestyle stuff, but retail stuff. This will cut down on the mail in my inbox drmatically. It had really gotten to the point where I would go a week , sometimes two without checking my email just because I didnt want to deal&nbsp; with it. Tonight I spent some time taking care of that. Ive been reading, not commenting much but I&nbsp;know what y'all have been up to and rest assured I will make a post of real content soon to let y'all know whats been going on with me. Till then, Im off to wind down for the night."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we had this clog in the sink in the bathroom. I treated it and it returned. Again I treated it and again it returned.&nbsp; Fed up and at the end of my rope with The Clog, I&nbsp;went to Wal-Mart and got a bottle of Instant Power Hair Clog Remover. Its 6 bucks a bottle. This stuff works !!! You have to follow the directions and you have to give it time but I&nbsp;promise you it works and it comes with a gurantee from the manufacturer as well. So if ya got a clog that you cant seem to get rid of, I would recommend this. Great stuff in a red bottle.&nbsp; Oh, and for the love of all that is holy, PLEASE read the warnings!!!! This stuff is CRAZY dangerous if you dont use it properly."

"event","So, apprently a new&nbsp; &quot;club&quot; has opened in the New Orleans area. I&nbsp;have heard wonderful things about the people running it and from what I understand they&nbsp; have a &quot;play room&quot; for people of like mind. Some people I&nbsp;know are visiting the new place this evening as an invitation for members of the local BDSM organization has been extended, with I believe a discount on the door fee. 

I want to understand, and Im not a lawyer, I&nbsp;dont have any experience with vice or anything like that. but I do NOT understand how these , lets be honest, sex clubs can open and be open about what goes on there but bdsm organizations have to fly under the radar to avoid being shut down for whatever reason. It cant be as simple as &quot;there is no consensual battery law&quot; can it? 

Okay I&nbsp;know there are some legal eagles on my f'list and Im asking for comments/opinions on this. Please feel free to comment annonymously if you wish&nbsp; as I do not wish for anyone to out themselves on my blog. This is just something that I have always had issue with and I would really appreciate some help in understanding why this is the way it is."

WE&nbsp;HAVE A BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;

My BESTEST Beth had a BABY&nbsp;GIRL&nbsp;this morning. She was at the hospital for 630 AM and we had a baby by Nine AM 

She had a C-section because of the baby being breach. Momma and baby are fine. I havent seen the little bundle of love yet because when I finally got to the hospital after work tonight, almost seven PM,&nbsp; I couldnt go to the NICU to see her. Shes fine but its standard procedure when the babies are this early (six weeks). Shes Five Pounds three&nbsp; ounces and umm.. 18 inches long , or 21 I cant remember off hand. 

I am BEYOND&nbsp;happy for my Beth. She hasnt had an alone moment since all this began. Between her friends and family and Pete, (baby daddy) family, shes being WELL&nbsp;taken care of. 


Okay, Math calls."

Not only are we getting a new President but we are also adding to the history books of our nation by swearing into office our first African-American President. Okay we all know he's bi-racial and truth be told it bothers me that he doesnt identify that way but I dont think that it has any direct effect on his ability to lead the nation. One thing is certain, the next four years will NOT be easy for the nation. In general, as a society, we do not adapt to change well and soon to be President Obama's whole platform is on CHANGE. 

I, like many others was very glad to have done my small part, by voting, to help bring this change to the nation. We'll see what the next four years bring."

They came and remeasured for the windows today, he said they shoudl be ready for install in about two weeks.. TWO&nbsp;WEEKS.. OMG. 
The electrical people are coming next Wednesday.. Yay!!! and Now... 

The hot water in the tub has been running at more than a trickle but nowhere near what it should be for awhile now and Ive&nbsp; had just about enough of it so I called the lovely people at Roto Rooter to come out.. he came out, said , well.. you have galvanized steel piping... you need to replace that, its okay for now but eventually its going to need replacing. Hes going to have soemone call me to see if someoen can come out later this afternoon/evening and work me up a price. Dear lord.. new pipes. I mean nothing is broken.. just old. Its a raised house so they wont have to bust into the foundation but oh good lord, plumbing.&nbsp; I dont even want to THINK&nbsp;about what they are going to want to charge me. Time to sceduele more estimates... the issue is going to be finding someone who will give free estimates.. Roto Rooter gives free estimates.&nbsp; Lord help me if the work I&nbsp;am doing on this house does not increase its value Im going to scream bloody fucking murder. 

There isnt enough money after the roof (three years ago), the new electrical and the windows for plumbing.. Im going to have to see about financing. Maybe the house can go one more year. We'll see.. I'll talk to Mr Man tonight and we'll decide on something AFTER I get some estimates scedueled and some prices down on paper.

"event","It was asked so Im going to do my level best to answer. WW is not so much about how many of something you can have but more about how many points are in that something that you are having. The pineapple I eat is canned. A bit larger than the size of a tuna can.. there is aprox. one cup in a can or two servings at half a cup each. When I run the nutritional information through the calculator it comes back at me at 2pts for the whole can. These are pineapples in thier own juice NOT&nbsp;in syrup. Once you add in the extra syrup I think the pts increase by at least two. And WW math is kinda psychotic.. like I can eat one 1pt cake now and one 1pt cake later and it be 2pts.. but if I eat 2 together its 3 pts. Its all about the numbers.. the calories, the fat and the fiber.. something with the fiber helps cancel out the fat and the more fiber , the less the points &lt;not always but most of the time&gt;. Yes its a LOT of counting and you gotta do the homework.. but its worth it. There are also SEVERAL zero pt foods. A bunch of veggies are zero pts so yay.. although just because something is zero pts doesnt mean I can eat as much of that as I want to. You can gain twenty pounds eating nothing but veggies just as easily as you can gain 20 pounds eating trash. In the end its ALL&nbsp;about portion control and watching what you eat. WW teaches you how to eat for your body type and the body that you want to achieve. The more weight you have to lose, the more pts you have to eat.. strange huh? You would think the more you have to lose the less you can eat but its a formula and it works. Im at 34 pts a day and there are some ladies in my group who have like 17 a day. I&nbsp;think the bare minimum is 16 a day.&nbsp; So, how many? As long as it fits into your pts. (Okay maybe not that easy cuz well.. a snickers bar fits into my pts but it doesnt mean I should have it)...."

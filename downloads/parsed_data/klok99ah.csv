"event","Listen up shit heads. I dont update my live journal anymore because its pointless. Every once in a while I will post something so fucking important that it will blow your mind how fucking important this is. This is so important that even Jesus himself has postponed his return to read this shit. Its more important then your shitty life or what you talk about in your livejournal. I dont care about how much your dog shits on your carpet, I dont care about how much you love your girlfriend or boyfriend, as a matter of fact I probably hate them and will eat them and if you post pictures of them they are ugly and deal with it, I dont care how terrible your fucking life is and refuse to read about you bitch and moan while your saggy ass tits hit the floor. I dont care that your roomates friends roomates dog died. No my friends, im acctually going to use this world wide web journal to make some constructive. 

Commando is one of the best movies ever made.
Dont argue this sentence because even Plato if he came back to life, couldnt argue against it. If he ever saw it he would tottaly love it just like everyone in the world does.

Why is this movie so fucking good?

look at the cover.

<img src=""http://www.mri.ernet.in/~movie/commando.jpg"" />

First of all this isent a movie about Arnold going commando. No my friends, this is a movie about A man made out of pure steel punching through other human beings made out of wool. Even if you havent seen it yet, you should know by the cover that its the best cover ever. Look at the quote ""Somewhere, Somehow,someone's going to pay"" at the top of the box. Even if you havent seen the movie you should figure out that its going to be fucking awesome. Once again this isent a movie about Arnold going commando borrowing some money to buy a fucking mazda miniata. ITs about him kicking some serious ass.

The movie starts out with Arnold hanging out and fucking cutting down some trees like real men should.  OK?! Then he fucking picks up some logs and carries them for at least one to 200 miles. He comes home only to be greeted by his little daughter. He tottaly is what a man should be, hardcore on the outside and sensitive on the inside. Here again is a great placement of why women should watch this movie. No this movie isent all about throwing pipes through people, there is also a bit of love. Arnold hangs out with his daughter tottaly and buys her ice cream. They bond and all that other shit. Women love this crap. Then this guy tries to kidnap his daughter. Arnold is tottaly not cool with that shit. So he runs to his super duper high tech shed to get his guns. Once he enters he finds a unarmend man wanting to negotiate with him for his daughter. Wrong move asshole. Of course the bad guy goes "" Lets negotaiate bitch"" then arnold goes ""WRong"" and shoots him in the head. He then tries to get to his car but the motor is missing or someshit. So he pushes it downhill and drives with no breaks to get the bad guys. He gets caught and these bad guys tottaly tell him how they are gonna kill hios daughter if he dosent kill some pansy in some country we probably bombed. So arnold aggrees and goes on a plane. BEFORE THAT HE TELLS SOME GUY THAT HES GONNA KILL HIM LAST. He kills the guy guarding him and says to the filight attendand ""Dont disturb my friend hes dead tired"" and then jumps of th e PLANE GOING 300 MPH. HE LANDS ON BOTH FEET IN A SWAMP AND ONLY GETS HIS SHOES WETT.  HE THEN FINDS SOME LADY TO DRIVE HIM. BEA C'AUSEW ARNOLD IS BIG HE RIPS OUT THE CAR SEAT TO FIT INTO HER CAR. HE CATHES THE GUY HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KILL LAST AND SAYS ""Remember Sully when I promised to kill you last? That's right Matrix you did. I lied!!"" and thorws him of a fucking clifff. OH SHIT. swweeet. SO arnold only has a couple of hours to save his daughter. He stops confidently to check what time it is because he knows this assignment is so easy he can stop at the mall or at chillies for some burgers.

<img src=""http://howadoor.wz.cz/Arnold_Schwarzenegger_in_Commando_2.jpg"" />

 THen arnold  goes and gets some guns. Remeber the ittale ""SOmehows, somewhere, someones gonna pay"" ? oh yeah they are. Arnold tottaly needs big guns. Of course he finds a bazzoka. WAIT. Not just one but 4 in 1. 


<img src=""http://i15.ebayimg.com/04/i/05/63/48/bd_1.JPG?set_id=7"" />



So he goes into their base and ruins everyones free day in the sun. At one point Arnold hides behind flower pots to dodge bullets and thats sweet.

SO in the end he finds his daughter and fights his enemey Benet. this is where the most important lines were delivered in the movie and world.

Bennett: [after he shot Matrix] John! How's your arm John? 
Matrix: [hidden behind a wall] Come over and find out! 
Bennett: No thanks, I think I'll take a pass. John, stick your head out, one shot, right between the eyes, I'll make it quick, just for old time sake. 
Matrix: Bennett, stop screwing around and let the girl go, Its me that you want, I only have one arm, you can beat me! 
[Bennett laughs] 
Matrix: [Comes out from hidden place] Come on Bennett, throw away the chicken shit gun, you don't just want to pull the trigger, you want to put the knife in me, and look me in the eye, and see whats going on in there when you turn it, thats what you want to do, right? 
Bennett: I can kill you John! 
Matrix: Come on, let the girl go, just between you and me, don't deprive yourself of some pleasure, come on Bennett, lets party! 
Bennett: I can beat you, I don't need the girl hahah, I DON'T NEED THE GIRL! 
[throws Jenny away] 
Bennett: I don't need the gun John. I can beat you. I DON'T NEED NO GUN! 
[Pulls out his knife] 
Bennett: AND I'LL KILL YOU NOW! 

So he tottaly fights him with knifes. In the end Arnold throws him against the wall and rips a pipe and throws it through his chainmail and his boddy. Steam then comes out of the pipe where arnpld replies ""LAy of some steam Bennett.""

Listen to this song as you read the lyrics...





a) Waltzing Matilda

Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
the sexy boy smiled in dismay
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
everybody's queen for a day
Oh, babe, I'm on fire and you know I admire your -
- body why don't we slip away
Although I'm sure you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'
sha-la-la-la, this way

Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
hey, baby, come on, let's slip away

Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a humpin' muscle
call out the national guard
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees
from off of the formica topped bar
And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly
and boldly out of this world
And despite people's derision
proved to be more than diversion
sha-la-la-la, later on

And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly
and showed her where he was coming from
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently
it was like she'd never ever come
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
when the sun rose and he made to leave
You know, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
neither one regretted a thing


b) Street Hassle

Hey, that cunt's not breathing
I think she's had too much
of something or other, hey, man, you know what I mean?
I don't mean to scare you
but you're the one who came here
and you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave
I'm not being smart
or trying to be cold on my part
and I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
But you know people get all emotional
and sometimes, man, they just don't act rational you know,
they think they're just on TV

Sha-la-la-la, man
why don't you just slip her away

You know, I'm glad that we met man
it really was nice talking
and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak
But you know it could be a hassle
trying to explain this all to a police officer
about how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed
And it's not like we could help
but there wasn't nothing no one could do
and if there was, man, you know I would have been the first
But when someone turns that blue
well, it's a universal truth
and then you just know that bitch will never fuck again
By the way, that's really some bad shit
that you came to our place with
but you ought to be more careful around the little girls
It's either the best or it's the worst
and since I don't have to choose
I guess I won't and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet
and just lay her out in the darkest street
and by morning, she's just another hit and run.
You know, some people got no choice
and they can never find a voice
to talk with that they can even call their own
So the first thing that they see
that allows them the right to be
why they follow it, you know, it's called bad luck.


c) Slipaway

Believe me (man), that's just a lie,
it's a lie she tells her friends.
'cause the real song, the real song
that she won't even admit to herself
[is] the beat in her heart.
It's a song lots of people know.
It's a painful song
but I wrote a sad truth
but alas for sad songs
a painful wish.
But wishin' won't make it so, Joe
With a pretty kiss for a pretty face
can't have its way
Y'know tramps like us, we were born to pay.

Love has gone away
and there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh, how I miss him, baby
Oh, baby, come on and slip away
come on, baby, why don't you slip away

Love is gone away
took the rings off my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh how, oh how I need him, baby
Come on, baby, I need you baby
oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
please don't slip away"

"event","What happend:
We have a tradition at the Cheatou Peg Pointe. We roomates sometimes get our blankets and throw them around us and walk around like that all day. Steven the founder of this tradition has caried it a far way. I dont know if you ever saw the video of those people role playing their fantasy. The one video where the guy screams lightning bolt as he throw rocks at guy dressed as a monster. Then a guy out of no where comes and screams root. This is where we got our insperation for the mockery.

Yesterday at approximatly 10:42:12 pm. Steve and I decided to attack anyone that comes in our caslte. Sam my roomate stepped in the gates of our cheatou. On the far cornor of the room I had been in my blanket reading. The minute our eyes met i knew i needed the help of the darwven warrior Quatallis (steve). ""Quatallis I summon you"" were the words that came out of my mouth. Quatallis the dwarf came out of his chamber and ran to my side. We approached the monster as i shot fire balls at him. I had cast heals on quatallis a lot because of the damage he was susstaining. He used a lot of warstomp to bring down the beast. Sam the beast decided to run for one of the chambers but we followed. The minute we got there he shot a bolt of lightning bolt. Quattallis died and i had to makea  run for it and used teleport. The castle was lost.

What really happend:
Last night steve and I were disscusing people who role play and how gay it was. So we decided to do make fun of them by doing it to whoever walked through the door first. Sam came in and all i did was scream fire bolt fire bold heal heal. Steve kept stomping hte ground and yelling WARSTOMP. Sam of course just stood there with a face that only can be traced to the words of WTF are you guys doing. So he went into the room and he got his camera to take a picture of us and the minute he flashed us with it steve died (lightning bolt) I on the other hand went to the door way and used my blanket to cover the door way so i couldnt be seen. As i dropped the blanket i screamend teleport and ran for my room. So it looked like a i vanished. 

I dont think i laughed that much in a long time. Sams face was pricless."

Im glad im learning from my past. Everything latley has been coming together and merging. Ive come a long way... Im starting to be diffrent. Latley its been weird. I dont even recognize myself as the person ive become. Its like im finnaly starting to figure out who I am. If that even makes sense.

I made a to do list:

-Get straight A's
-Become Better at guitar
-Become good friends With Ashley Buerkett... just because shes really a nice person and I was being a dick about things, I hope she accepts my appology. Shes a good girl.
-Finish finding out who I am
-Write some songs
-Become Famous


I just find it amazing how much I changed this year. Its like ive finally come out of a shell. Im still in shock. Wow. Im acctually happy for the first time in years where its acctually going on without stopping. Man Im really enjoying my life right now. I dont want to change anything in it. I have amazing friends and family. God im in the best mood ever.

Thank you Dan<3!!!!!!!!!! For picking me up. I really appreciated that. I hope i gave you enough money!


You dont even know how happy I am."

For some reason I cant sleep. I have just been listening to some music. I miss Ashley, and I cant wait to go home and relax. I think I need a good bed to sleep in. The bed I sleep in sucks ass, my feet fall off, and if I turn in it I fall and break my neck. I really dont know what to write in this journal tonight. I felt like updating. I pretty much miss Ashley. I dont know what else to say. I think im gonna go watch the Led Zepellin Dvd that Greg left here. Im bored there isent much to do at 5 am. All these people sleeping. Boooooo youre missing out here on high quality life with me. Maybe not. Listen to Life on Mars? by David Bowie. Today I remmbered about how us 20 used to sleep at Raymond's house. We were all in the living room having the biggest pillow fight and Raymond jumped on Charlegne and pulled her pants down by accident. Then we all missed Sokol who was sleeping in a Gladware box thingi. So we carried him in the box to living room and he woke up in the middle of the trip saying a bunch of stuff. Calling us a bunch of black people. Then we tried to get Mollo hax of the computer and to join us in the living room. So I took over the mic and told his internet buddies that me and him were gay, and they tottaly like dint want Mollo in their clan. And whatever happend to speaking 1337 what the fuck? We used call everything hax. Remeber when Cicis was called Cicis Hax, Cicis Hax. And remember that damn green machine. Good times.

Jk is a popcorn slut = your car is broken. HA HA HA

Im so tired bla bla bla. I feel like calling Ashley to talk to her and tell her whats up, I love you baby, but its 5 am. Shes sleeping on the couch tonight. Little does she know how bad I want to be there. I hope everything goes good with her in Champagin. I read her El Jay the other day and shes pretty stressed. She needs a good vacation.


Anyways time for Movie. If you read this at 6 am and want to come over feel free to."

Just hanging out with Steve again is so much fun. Ive been in a pretty good mood latley. Im going to do fine this semester. My classes are the way I want, exactly. Everything is perfect except one little thing. Well, not really little. Its somewhat important. Well... its very important. I miss my Ashley a lot. Im having a lot of fun and all, but shes on my mind every minute of the day. Im having a blast, while being sad on the inside because I miss her so much. I hope she misses me too. I miss her a lot. Let me stress that again. I miss her a lot. Again. I miss her a lot. And again. I miss her a lot. Poor her having to deal with those scene kids all alone... tis tis. I respect a strong woman like her. Again. I miss her a lot. Im not gonna lie. I love the girl. Shes to perfect, I can not wait to see her this weekend. Her birthday is coming up and I think I found the right present for her. Well not present... more like presents. Im exited to give it to her. I love seeing her smile. She has a nice smile. I dont think I tell her that a lot. Her smile is beautiful. I hope this present makes her smile. Not just smile for a minute. Maybe hopefully for years. I love seing the girl happy. Shes lucky man. I wish my smile was somewhat beautiful.   

Ive been listening to Nick Drake latley. Im sure everyone has heard of him. Hes a good folk player. He led a pretty deppresing life though. He then accidently died too. Shame. I hate when good tallent just goes to waste. He was so good."

"event","Supposedly its the coldest day ever in Florida. I love it. I love that its in the 20's. Well nothing much has been going on these days just been hanging out with chris, randall and the crew. This town has been dead for a while but thanks to our efforts we made it partly alive. Im acctually having a decent break, other then the fact that some people have changed. Ive been making peace with some people. So everythings good. Im kind of pissed about the job at the gift shop. Everyday shes been telling me you can come in tommorow. Today I found out that I can work only after christmas. With the camping trip and trying to go see Ashley that wont work out. So I had some sad time today, because I really wanted to see Ashley and go to the camping trip. I was laying around playing guitar. I thought Jesus I need to go get a job. I promised Ashley id do my best to go see her because that will make her happy. So instead of playing guitar I drove around all day looking for a job that could hire me on the spot. I called Dan in the end and he is taking me to lay concrete, dig holes and other cool stuff. Construction. Awesome. He says its hard work. Ill do it. I dont care if i have to work for 5 dollars an hour for 20 hours a day to see Ashley. I said id do my best. Another thing is that I feel bad. I mean ill go see her but its the 29th to like the 7th. I feel bad and i think its rude for me to stay so long. Plus she wanted to give me money for the ticket. I cant accept that. Shes already letting me stay at her house.  Thats way to long. I dont want it to be a burden for her family and all. Ill just do whatever she wants me to. My parents want me to visit for 3 days or so. Ill do whatever is most comfterable with her and her parents. I dont want to be a burden.
She hates it when i say that. ITs the way i was raised ha. Understand. Id really love to stay that long though. Hell yeah I would.

Another thing is the lack of sleep ive been getting. Like this morning i went to sleep at like 4 woke up at 7 dint sleep at all after that. Im exhausted. I need some freaking sleep. MAybe this cold weather will help. Im gonna open the window tonight and sleep infront of it. 

Then again this is one of those i dint sleep in a long time updates where i hardly know what im talking about. 

Alright im out i gotta get up in 6 to dress and go work in the cold. For some reason I cant wait."

"event","I havent slept in a couple of days. This morning at 6 am I had the pleasure of acctually falling a sleep and dreaming. Wow. Yes score. I had two dreams. One I semi remember the other was shit. Im never going to sleep because of it again.

 First it started so sweet. I was meeting up with Ashley at the theatre downtown to see some movie. It was around 8 pm and I was waiting for her. So I look around for her and finially see her. Shes walking with this other guy and she has her arm around him and he has his arm around her. At first im like, oh she brought a guy friend to a our date. I dint care as long as I got to see her. I walked up to her, gave her a hug and she pushed me away. Im thinking, did I do something wrong? She looks at me and says""Im sorry this isent going to work out."" I said ""What isent?"" She looked at me smiled ""Us."" I said ""Why?"" As I waited for she put both arms around that guy and then kissed him. She said ""Hes just so much hotter then you and hes just a better person."" Time froze in my dream. I dint know what just happend. It all took me by such a suprize. I wanted to break down. I looked her in the eyes and just told her the truth. I told her that ive never felt this way for anyone. That i truly loved her with soul and body. I told her that in a relationship a person does best whats for the other, so they can be truly happy. She seemend so happy with this guy. She was laughing and smiling. Her eyes were glitering. I could tell she dint want me. So since she was out of this realtionship and i wasent, I did the only thing I could to make her happy. Just for the last time. So I let her go and all the fun times we had. I dint fight, you cant make a person fall in love with you. They like who they like. It was a battle I coulnt win. As they walked away she hit his butt like she used to do to me. I was envious, so madd , so jelous. Im never jelous. There went the best girl in the world. All I could say was ""Youre happy. I wish you the best. I just wished i could of kissed you one last time."" They walked in the movie theatre and I dint see her again. Then it started to rain really hard, as i walked for some reason john lennon - jelous guy was playing. I just thought ""what did i do wrong?"" As i was walking there were girls waiting for me with open arms telling me that theyll be my girlfriend. I just passed them. I dint want anyone one else. There is only one ashley. If i cant have her then i dont want anyone else. She truly is the best person in the universe. As I crossed the street I got hit by a car. Then i awoke in the hospital. The doctor told me that I was in a coma for 3 months. He told me that ill never be able to walk, not play the guitar. He also said that no one came to visit me during those 3 months and that everyone forgot about me. I just layed in the bed in sielence. The nurse came to pick me up and threw me in a wheelchair. She took me outside and just dumped me on the street. She said no one cares about me. I was laying there on the street and people were walking over me like pavement. I felt dead inside. Then someone picked me up and i looked up. It was freaking john lennon. He said "" You look like a faggot laying there on the ground. Youre not a quiter. Just keep going."" I just felt a tear go down my cheek. 

Thats when I woke up. I was just laying there for an hour. Freaking big ouchie man. 
A couple of hours later Ashley called me. She told me she loved me. I almost freaking died in happieness. YES!  

I dont want to sleep ever again. What i just dreamnt were my biggest fears in life. I hope it dosent happen again."

"event","A couple of things on my mind...

 So today we were talking about people being faithfull and all. I dont understand how someone can cheat on someone they love and not tell them. The worst part is how they can go back to the one they love and pretend nothing happend. Oh everything is good except I tottaly cheated on you. I am somewhat madd at a couple of people that I know and have done this. They should consider telling their loved ones that they cheated on them. ITs the right thing to do. Put your self in the persons foot step. Dont use the excuse ""If I tell them theyll break up with me, and I love them so much."" Well tough fucking shit son. You shoulnt of done anything. If you love a person you woulnt want to hurt them in anyway. In a realtionship nothing should be kept from each other. Its not right. A relationship is a bond with a person you love, that you cheerish every second with them. If you go out and cheat then its not a relationship, youre just wasting another persons time and hurting them. 

Anyways, Nothing new has been going on. My girlfriend left on saterday morning. I miss her a lot. Ive been hanging out with Vic, Dan and Chris a lot. I really miss them. Im glad to hear dan is reportion back to school and will show everyone that he can do this. I still believe in him altough everyone lost hope. Go Dan. I feel bad for Vic and his little relationship trouble. Youll pick the right girl with time. Chris ill miss you man and so will sarasota. It will never be the same ever again. 
Man we had some good times. Thanks Bane for letting me vent about some stuff. Youre awesome.

Another thing Ive been thinking about is Ashley. She really dosent know how happy she makes me. She is such a extrodenary person. I like everything about her. She dosent have any flaws what so ever. When we were saying our good byes i actually had watery eyes. Thats very very odd for me. Girls never have this effect. I do know what love is now. Its her in every single way. Ive never felt like this ever. She is so perfect. She actually cares about me. That makes me so happy. I am acctually secure to the point where I can ""Hey wait a minute. I ACUTTALY LOVE THIS GIRL."" And i do mean love. She means the world to me. I know a lot of you will be like oh its been 2 months you just dont know what you are talking about. I do know what i am talking about. 100% sure. I ve had a girlfriend for almost 2 years and i knew i dint love her that way. BUt this is so diffrent. Everything feels so real. It has texture. I love it. Shell probably be reading this and think im a crazy kid while shes removing from her cell phone. All i can say is. I love you Ashley Burkett. Thank you Existing. YOU make me so god damn happy. Youre putting direction in my life. Ive been needing you for so long and I finially found you. Thank god.






























Happy Birdthday Dunja

Ashley,
Lago bi puno, ako bi reko da ovo sto imamo nie nista specialno. Lago bi ako bi recko da sam sanjo otebi i sve je perfectno, sato kada nespvam i smo sajedno on da je perfectno, i bolje nego snajane.

My love, guitar, school




I finished learning the first part of Romance de Amor on guitar. Its a good love song and has a lot of feeling in it. I can play it cleanly and at the wanted speed. Its amazing how you can express love through a song. Ive gone far in guitar. Maybe when people ask me to play I should stop playing the same song. I know so many. School is going good. Math is hard but oh well. I miss Ashley. She really does rock my world. I must be the luckiest guy in the universe. I also my miss my brother. I havent seen that kid in so long."

Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit- crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.

"event","I'm in the computer lab in the staff lounge here at Philmont Boy Scout Ranch.  i'm on my first set of days off...woohoo.  we did training for a week in base camp and then scattered out to our asigned camps.  It's been quite an adventure: new people, new place, new experiences.

we've been getting everything ready for the scouts to show up at Beaubien (the western lore camp i'm working at)
we've been doing things like:
-dehanting (the mice and rants out here carry a disease in their crap called the hantavirus that can be deadly)
-moving into our staff cabins, checking out the camp sights
-helping the wranglers get their horses ready for trail rides
-geting used to the people we'll we working with for the next 2 and a half months
-playing with our cats (magic and trix)
-learning how to do a chuck wagon dinner
-practicing roping and branding
-getting tanned in the dry New Mexican Sun
-using outhouses called red roof inns (not quite at luquriouse)
-wearing western wear like coyboy boots and hats
- being away from the rest of the world and ways of communication

yeah...i'm living on a ranch...its weird but fun most of the time even though our group had had some issues.  but, overall we're all enjoying ourselves and trying to make the best of being away from what we are used to.

the first scout crews showed up in base a couple days ago and made their way to Beaubien today (of course i'm not working with them since i'm off for another day and a half) it should make everything between the staff there better because we won't be only with eachother and getting on eachother's nerves.

well i guess it's time to have crappy dining hall food...ick..

and remember write to me and i'l write back (address in last post)"

I love you Gramcracker!"

VIII. Some Thoughts

I. My Grandmother in Florida who has the brain cancer is fading fast.  i was supposed to go see her this coming weekend down in Tampa, but my aunt who is down there with her found out from the doctor that the cancer could take Grandmother away any day now.  It could just happen.  She the family is gonna bring her back up north once she stops enjoying being by the ocean.  She needs help to stand up every time and gets tired from the littlest things.  I love Grandmother/Gramcracker and I want to make sure i see her at least one more time before she takes her journey to the eternal bubble of love.  The one good thing is that brain cancer causes no physical pain, well at least in her case, so its just causing her to slow down more and more as the days pass.

II. I found out that i got the job at Philmont Boyscout Ranch in New Mexico.  It is a working ranch on over 137,000 acres of land.  I will be at a western camp doing westerny stuff.  My boyfriend (who did the western thing last year and is doing black smithing and mining this year) and his father are both working there so at least i'll know some people.  I'm excited and i think it'll be way better than spending the summer in North Adams, even though i was kinda excited about that also.  I'm getting a ride out there with Adam and his father on the 24th of May, one day before my finals are over, and i'll be back a week or two before the fall semester starts.  The only thing that is bad about these plans is that i will not be able to attend any UU stuff over the summer and will not be able to see the amazing people that i mostly only see once a year.

III. I got a part time job at Topia Arts Center in Adams, MA until i leave in May.  I'll be opening the cafe on thursday mornings.  This will help Nana and Karin get some stuff done that they need.  They want to give me a job when i get back after the summer also.  This rocks cuz i wanna own an arts cafe/center later in life so it will give me all types of stuff that will help me with that.  Also i am going to do an internship for school credit with them in the fall.

IV. School is getting crazy with finals coming up and final projecty stuff happening.  It feel like i'm in high school again cuz i'm getting out at the very end of May but whatever.  I'm still meeting new people and getting to be better friends with some that i already know.  I am enjoying my time here and am very glad that i transfered.  I also already signed up for fall classes and i found out that i will actually be ahead of schedual with courses even though i though i was gonna be behind.

V. I'm starting to get ready to pack up all my stuff and move it into my new apartment.  I found a place to move into with a girl at school.  It's an old brick school building, and even though my new room will be real small, it is in a better location and cheaper (even though i have to pay utilities too).  I'm storing my stuff there for the summer for a small price and then i'm gonna start to live there when i get back at the end of the summer.  My current landlord called and is starting to show the place to perspective tenants.  Its a little stressful to have to clean and keep the place clean on top of everything else, but it'll be good to keep clean before moving anyways.  I dunno how steve is doing at his apartment search but hopefully everything will go smoothly.

VI. I got a tattoo a couple weeks ago.  I want to thank Erin Stephens-North for the design that she drew me 6 years ago.  It is a Chalice with a flame and a woman standing behind it.  It took 2 and 1/2 hours to do and cost $120.  It was completely worth it because i now have an amazing religiouse symbol drawn by a friend permanently on my upper back.  Thanks you Erin.  Also, Erin, i would like you to name her so if you can let me know a name i will forever call the chalice lady by that name. Thanks. Oh and Adam got his FreeMasons tatoo on his upper left arm that week too.

VII. Over the last 2 and a 1/2 months i have fallen in love with Adam.  I am enjoying being with him, spending time with him, and doing random stuff (lacrosse, shopping, driving, playing video game, the works) with him.  I love his family and feel so comfortable around him and them.  The other night he stayed over and we made a nice little dinner and ate by candle light.  We have our little relationship bumps but thats required for healthy relationships and we are getting through every smoothly.  I love you hun!

VIII. Its getting to the point in my personal mental cycle where big things are happening (even though many are good) and i get stressed and depressed.  At least this time i am aware of it and hopefully that will make it easier to deal with.  Things are changing.  Pam is graduating in 2 weeks and moving to LA with her boy, so i guess the sisters will be apart for a while.  I'll miss you Pooks!  I'm slowly moving apart from norwood people, which i guess is ok but hard.  I care about them all very much and hope that everything goes the best it can for them.  I also want to stay in contact as the years go by because i know that i will always wonder what they are up to even if i am far away mentally or physically.  Melissa is doing great at her program where i went to visit her on the cape.  Yay Her!  I'm gonna miss my mommy over the summer because i know that i still need her very much.  I lost internet at my place for the time being (thank you power thingy that blew outside of my apartment!) so its hard to stay in touch with people.

Well, my wrists hurt from typing and because i just got out of my piano class so i guess thats it for now."

They are living at my apartment so we have 4 female rodents here.  (starting to turn into an infestation or something)

thanks adam, for the wonderful week and a half or so.  :D

there were some difficulties around norwood but i am glad to say everything seems to have worked out for now.

i sent in my application to work at philmont boyscout ranch in new mexico all summer.  i gotta call them tomorrow to make sure they got it.  it would be awesome to spend the summer out in the wilderness working with my hands and being able to have the opportunities that i would never get a chance to otherwise.  wish me luck.

also been thinking about what my living arrangements are gonna be for the fall, especially if i go away for the summer.  i'm also wishing steve the best of luck finding a place back around boston.

pam turned 22 on friday and i didn't even see her but i sent her this funny e-card with a birthday parrot...not that it makes up for not seeing my pookie on her b-day, but...gnilunt16

i'm working at topia arts cafe 10am-7pm tuesday and thursday with this kid who i hung out with the other night.  i'm excited that i get to work with something that is what i want to do with my life...can you see it? me owning an arts cafe? of course you can.

"event","Dear Steve,

you are an amazing person who deserves to be happy.  i am sorry that us living together doesn't seem to be working.  we just deal with things in a completely opposite way, and that clashes.  Please don't think that i think any less of you or respect you any less because of our differences.  I still believe that you deserve way better in life than you have ever had and you especially deserve better than having to deal with me and my messy room mate ways.  I want to see you happy and doing what you love.  It makes me so overjoyed to see your art work and hear you playing music.  I just wish that you were happy.  I know i keep saying it but i really want that for you.  I so badly want to help you get to where you want to be in life, but i have realized that you are going to have to do that on your own, which you already know.  I'm sorry about last night (or this morning, whatever) and i wish i had not snapped at you in front of all our friends.  I'm not mad at you.  I just know that this is not working.  I am going to start looking for new living arrangements sooner than i expected and i hope you find a place to live that lets you have what you need out of life.  Please know that you are just about my best friend in norwood, or anywhere.  We've shared a lot of shit over the past 8 months, looking for an apartment, moving, learning how to live with a room mate, watching baby rats, and a million other things.  It has been a great experience and i want to thank you for coming out to the middle of no where with me.  i would not have been able to do this without you.
thank you
with love,
riky"

i won't wait for you to wonder
i'll just tell you why i'm here

he tells us we might think he's weird but ""do you believe that god talks through people?""

then he goes into this whole thing about how we were holding hands and the way we were and asking us odd questions like what the word ""abide"" really means...

we just stood there and stared at him

i wish i had recorded it because as soon as we walked away, my brain was so confused i forgot most of what he said!  DAMNIT

what a fucked up experience...but then, life is nothing without experience...am i right?

other than that i had a rockin day:
woke up
posted a pro-pot thing on an anti-drug website
picked up adam
rented a movie
went to the mall - yay big misfits patch for my awesome new jacket thing
came back
played pool - i somehow did well!
ate at the cafe - ick!
slept 3 hours - bad idea
watched harold and kumar, fuckin hilarious
came home
and here i am awake, and chillin

2 mondays ago adam invited me to hang out.
it was awesome and we have a ton in common, though many things different too.
we've been hanging out every day, in the scene shop, in his dorm, in class, my place.
we started dating last friday and its been so awesome.
i'm really happy with how everything's going.
i've been happy...it feels like its been too long since thats been the case.
i fall asleep thinking about him and i wake up just to count the time till i get to see him again.

i just don't want this to get fucked up.
i feel like i fail miserably when it come to a good relationships.
but i like him, a lot.
and i want this to work so bad.
he makes me feel good about myself and excited about life again.

i was scared that i had lost all passion for life, no reason to get up in the morning, no reason to do anything but sit on my ass smoking butts and bowls.
i guess i was wrong, which is deff a good thing.

adam's stayin over at the apartment sat. and sun. which should be a good time.
something about falling asleep next to a warm body is very comfortable.
speaking of sleep, i guess i should head in that direction, even if it is alone.

You need to be number one in everything, no matter how trivial

i'll take it next semester hopefully and that will erase the F
why does it seem like i'm going through the same thing as i did in high school?
just wanting it to be over with

"event","I stand alone in a field of false hopes and broken dreams.  I am cold and lonely.  Everything I touch turns to cold steel.  The flowers, the animals, my soft old comforter.  The sharp shards that are left standing from a once proclaimed liveliness, are shattered all over the bristly ground that once padded my feet as carpet.  I try to sleep but my mattress has stiffened as my skin rests against the woven threads that have spun themselves into wires.  Even the rain has turned to nuts and bolts as I stand out on the stiff metallic grasses.  Once, when I was young, my senses were filled with aroma's and cottony softness.  Now my breath sits atop the air, solid and frozen.  My blood has gone from reds and blues to a mercury pulsing through my veins.  I can no longer caress the warmth of my lover's soft flesh.  It, along with the rest of my life, has smoldered in the dying flames of my heart."

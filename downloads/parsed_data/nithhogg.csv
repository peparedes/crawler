"event","From a new very nice edition of Baudelaire's famous anthology. Actually this is from an appendix of his prose in the edition:

""One should always be drunk. That's all that matters; that's our one imperative need. So as not to feel Time's horrible burden that breaks your shoulders and bows you down, you must get drunk without ceasing.
  But what with? With Wine, with poetry, or with virtue as you choose. But get drunk.
  And if, at some time, on the steps of a palace, in the green grass of a ditch, in the bleak solitude of your room, you are waking up when drunkeness has already abated, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the clock, all that which flees, all that which groans, all that which rolls, all that which sings, all that which speaks, ask them what time it is; and the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock will reply: 'It is time to get drunk! So that you may not be martyred slaves of Time, get drunk; get drunk and never pause for rest! With wine, with poetry, or with virtue, as you choose!'"""

But it looks like the police for me. Ive considered this in the past and I think its the best thing I can do now..
Anna is being awesome and well stay together while Im in Poriria IF Im accepted. Therell be a lot of back and forth. Ill miss her lots. But at the end of it at least Ill have a stable job with some serious perks and Itll pretty much fulfill my requirements of a career. Ill be on my feet, Ill be able to work at things I want to, get reasonable pay and benefits, education, promotion, variety, etc.
Office work sucks ass anyway.
Playing lots of everquest 2. MMORPGs are so rewarding in the most insubstantial ways. I have a L32 Norse Shadowknight, which is kind of a fighter with necromantic/spellcasting abilities, and a Darkelf Assassin girly who is nearly L10 now. Its really fun to be able to applying Satanic witch type tricks on the mostly male population of freeport. Lots of free stuff.
Was goingto go to the dawn parade but weather was crap, so instead I drove to Annas at silly in the morning and we had breakfast and went back to bed. Then we went to the art gallery and saw the 60s pop-art exhibition which was interesting. They had a quite few of Billy Apple's works on display. I loosely know Billy, he lives in Mt. Eden these days. He was talking about opening a Pop-art museum in that same locale last we spoke.
Need to find something to DO in the weekend... Anna is entertaining a friend from hamilton. I may leave them to it.. but it would be good to go out and do something involving town and alcohol."

"event","Well I can support myself most of the time with my business, but now I need more money to entertain myself with the huge amount of downtime and also something to do in the downtime. Extra cash is also useful. perhaps Ill be able to save money for once. So Im looking at doing something else to do. Im getting a pretty weak response from marketing - just enough to keep ticking over - but then I dont want to grow too quickly yet. Blah, what to do? Id kind of like to be on my feet a bit more. I could viably do my current workload in a couple of days a week. So joining the police is again something to think about. Perhaps some security work - but the police offers me quite a lot in terms of development whereas security does not. The police requires a lot more dedication and time - most difficult being 5 months training in porirua -  but also far greater benefits long term. I could do some collection work part time but most of the time the money for that wouldnt be worth driving in and parking to get. Also most companies with a collections department and all collection companies have a conflict of interests clause, which means I wouldnt be able to do it and run my own buiness - defeating the purpose of it. I could pick up something menial like being a showroom hand or perhaps retail again - which could be fun but I cant be bothered with the lack o' respect for the position. Thinking....blah.
    
   Looking at places to move into with Anna and Amber. Noone is too rushed so we can afford to be picky. This is good. Looking forward to living with people I am friendly with again.
    
   Anna's 'lil sister decided to have a party while the Dad was away last friday night. Anna and I bounced for it. I broke up a couple of fights and the highlight of the night was smacking some guys head against the house whilst in headlock and kicking him out onto the street for the pigs to eat. Dealt with the police and didnt have much trouble from them on the property. Its really crazy how angry girls can get guys to listen to them. Anna kicked a couple of guys out on her lonesome and I was really impressed. 
*LOVE YOU BABY!!! You are too cool.* 
Heh, my flatmate Amy has just given me an old Securitas jacket. They mustve been out of business a while.
Spent te rest of the weekend tidying and recovering w/ junkfood and movies. I hate bottle duty. Re-aqainted myself with the ""Carry on"" team and watched Carry on Dick (Turpin). Couldnt find Carry on columbus which I think was the funniest.
We also watched this really wierd movie called ""Nothing"" about two loosers who aquired the power to make anything they hated disappear. Firstly the world outside their flat disappeared and slowly things in their flat then bad memories etc. They inevitably get angry with each other untill the movie ends with nothing but a couple of heads making up with each other and going on an eternal head bouncing race in the nothingness. Which by the way is bright white and feels like what on of them imagines Tofu might feel like.  And their long suffering turtle. I dont think Ill watch that movie again but it was wierd."

"event","The Big Day Out was fun. Didnt like many of the bands but some were pretty cool. The day was fun. Worried about Anna in the moshpit for the first little while and was acting like human shield for a while. As it turns out shes a kisk-ass moshpit girl. Saw a cool angry girl band called Sleater-Kinney. CUTE AS FUCK stompy guitarist girl. Also saw the Brunettes. A girl I grew up with is the bassist - Riannon Timu (I remembered!). Anna liked them lots. A fight broke out next to us in the boiler room during shapeshifter and I got angry because I didnt want the gurl to be hurt. Smacked one guy over and the guy behind went down after him. Then Anna pitched into the ground and I covered her. Stuff went down without us and I got an apology afterwards which I casually acknowledged. IGGY POP WAS SWEEET. humping stage equipment, stagediving, mooning, prancing like a mad ... IGGY. Didnt play lust for life or the passenger but played two versionsa of I wanna be your dog. Also there was not an ocelot to be seen.
Later we were helping out the dodgy parking attendant to manually move parked cars out of the way so people could exit. Anna's friend Amy has a boyfriend named Hamish who seems like a really cool guy. He was looking at buying my car and seems at least interested. 
So Im not friends with Tony anymore. I guess that was unavoidable and I expected it so... que cera cera. I feel bad. I hate loosing good friends. Not without its complications however and I did what I could to not be the bad guy but it was inevitable. Im no saint. Theres even an anti-me slogan with that crowd now: ""Jared is no friend of yours."" Because as we all know its as simple as I am a manipulative cold hearted bastard, which is not even a half-truth in this case, and girls OBVIOUSLY dont have minds or wills of their own. Point is she didnt break up with Tony ""for me"". She had her own reasons. But it WAS difficult to hide that we got really close, or wait the ""acceptable"" period of time before getting together. I beleive we did our best to be honourable to our friend, although I am not going to fool myself into thinking that I am without guilt.
Other than that life is very very good. Plans are going ahead. Anna is the coolest coolest coolest. The last 10 days have been for the most part both eventful and heavenly."

"event","Hi James,
Ill have to get back to you, but an evening sounds good. Unfortunately Im going off like a lame skyrocket as Im starting a business and I need to get clients and loose ends sorted quickly. Not to mention the Christmas season.

That Article is really interesting. I suppose I could explain here some of my own beleifs. Be prepared!
I objectify the known and unknown ALL of the universe and everything in it as god. 
I beleive that there are many traditions operating in the world as ""psychic"" wells for our benefit. I dont mean that they are maintained by some strange fairy towers by telepathy (at least I dont know about that...;-), but by psychic I mean that they are formed and maintained within the mind or soul somewhat consistantly through long periods of time. These ""wells"" have been initiated and augmented by many men who have looked at the nature of our world and our condition very carefully and have attempted to bring back to mankind something that will help it. 
Most of these men beleive that ""God"" is an intelligent being which can be or is embodied as a person - or at least personified. I am unaware of your personal beleifs, but this is not mine. I beleive even the greatest men of the spirit had only the most rudimentary knowledge of the All. Most of these men were also inspired to feel a great sympathy toward mankind, and also a great frustration at the way we seem to be trapped in a cycle of misery by the forces of our own nature. I beleive that everything is God - good and evil are the judgements of mankind alone. But this human judgement and observation of the way of the All is what is important. 
The decay of belief in God has engendered an apathy which will eventually destroy our civilisation - as it did in Rome and in many other great civilisations. Our civilisations have all been built on the dream of some discription of utopia or heaven. Instead we are creating a chaotic hell. This has little to do with drugs or sexual morality, but due to jelousy, apathy, unchecked materialism, and ultimately the inability to communicate with our ""brother"" men. We can no longer see a common horizon. At risk of being labelled a racist, which I am not, I believe that another cause of this is the forced mixing of so many different CULTURES on a grand scale.
I havnt decided yet whether I think this is ultimately good or bad - but I like living in a society that wants to be governed by justice.
I believe at this point for many reasons, that Freemasonry is or may be ""..the keystone of OUR civilisation"".
I do not beleive in static traditionalism, but in dynamic and evolving traditionalism, built from solid ground and continually rising.
I dont actually belong to any previously organised church.

Do these ideas seem compatible with your organisation?

Thanks,

Jared"

Definately a friend to keep though. Tonys on Saturday. Didnt go to Sally's b/day as was BROKE or to Evette's. 
  Well I have my very own Fax/Printer/Scanner/Copier now. Ra. Ive had a few inquiries already about assett recoveries. This is surprising. First real business week of the year and Im getting work. Cold-calling is goddamn boring. Im getting a bit of interest though. There was a last minute change to business details. I am now running SPECIAL Business Receivables Services, as opposed to small business.... Looks like I might have to do some more work in Tauranga. I love getting paid to do road trips. Im doing some evidence gathering for the Ol' Man also. Shouldnt be too strenuous. Ill start after dinner.
  Rowan's plans to take over Nostromo Books are becoming closer to fruition. Helped him out for some of the day negotiating with Brent (current owner) and talking with some shark Londoner guy about finance. He may be able to avoid the finance if he can put the right kind of pressure on Brent. Brent wants to but freaks out whenever ANYTHING seems black and white. Cracking a soft egg in this case is harder than cracking a hard one. Rowan was getting some abusive texts or something and wanted me to help out with that - but it appears to have stopped. Dont know exactly what I couldve done. I believe he is a very patient player who uses his buddhist mind powers pretty well. Om mani padmi hum. Then we played practical jokes on Yahoo chatroom punters for a while. Id really like it if Rowan was in charge of Nostromo. Good things.
    Saturday Highlight: Oh there was a 1962 Mk.2 something Jaguar in St. Lukes shopping mall car park. It stayed there for ages as its shiny hood ornament seemed to call me from afar. After downing several Drambuie and Orange juices, and then going for the bottle, I decided to scout it out. It was blue, but it was in very very nice condition. All original except for the engine. Tony and Anna were with me idolising the heavenly vehicle. Anna was lying on the ground establishing a psychic bond with it, and were all talking about it. A guy walks past and says ""It's the wrong color."" As he came around and saw Anna on the ground Im surprised she didnt bang her head. Wierd looks. None of us skipped a beat though and we ended up having a quite amicable twenty minute conversation about the Jag. Apparently he paid $16k for it and $2k to replace the engine. I was surprised that it had needed very little panelwaork at all. 
Start saving???? 
SO on Wednesday I think Ill go to washworld and tidy my car up. Then I might be tempted to eat a crocodile pizza."

And was consumed by the grief of its limitation.
Wandering in the desert there was naught that evaded his gaze
And his wisdom.
For he was before the sphere.
Mourning in the dream he had,
Now further seeming than ever before.
Confronted with the material of the immanent.
And bound to act within its laws.
Would that he had not known the heavens already,
he would have cried unto them.
But he did know.
And he cursed them.
He knew then his apartness from all in heaven and earth, and in the void.
Did he know that his dream was futile then?
What could he create? That did not only destroy.
But what he could remember,
Could only enslave.

New Years was spent outside Peter's. Colin was there. I have NEVER seen Colin attend ANY social event. Ive known him for more than 6 years now. I like Colin. 2 bottles of port and my thoughts kept me company as did Anna and occasionally Tony. I wasnt completely antisocial but as the port kicked in I really needed the open spaces. A trail of destruction and chaos was left in my wake on the trail back to Tony's. Port is a happy drink. Red for Port and White for Sake. Weird port is good but not wine. 

Saw a Parsee in New Lynn today buying charcoal, whilst procuring Sushi for Anna and myself. We have had a Scrapped Princess marathon for the last two days. He expressed his surprise at my recognition of the Tattoo of Ahura Mazda that adorned his arm, and indeed that I knew what Zoroastrianism is. Also expressed his dislike of the Alexander the Great movie because the Persians were all played by Arabs. There is a Parsee temple in New Lynn.

Nik informed me this evening via text message that he was a Snustmeister. Upon enquiring if Snust had something to with smell, Nik replied: ""No, but if you mix snust with bondage you get 'Snondage'."" Thanks Nik! Oh I forgot to mention me and Tony went to Nik's place in Takapuna on the 22nd to celebrate midsomer. First time Ive caught up with Nik for quite some time. Mead and Whiskey is good. Nik is a blonde psycho.

Moved Tony's cousin out of his place in Henderson quick pronto between Xmas and Newyears due to septic breakup.  Had to negotiate with the cops to let us get Matt's stuff out of the house. Lucky I arrived when I did. It is now vaguely possible to move inside Tony's flat.

Women should learn self-defense.

If a woman is walking alone at night, don't rape her.
If a women is drugged and unconscious, don't rape her.
If a woman is wearing a short skirt, don't rape her.

If a woman looks like your ex-girlfriend you're still hung up on, don't rape her.
If a woman is asleep in her bed, don't rape her.
If a woman is asleep in your bed, don't rape her.
If a woman is doing her laundry, don't rape her.
If a woman is in a coma, don't rape her.
If a woman changes her mind in the middle of or about a particular activity, don't rape her.
If a woman has repeatedly refused a certain activity, don't rape her.
If a woman is not yet a woman, but a child, don't rape her.
If your girlfriend or wife is not in the mood, don't rape her.
If your step-daughter is watching tv, don't rape her.
If you break into a house and find a woman there, don't rape her.

If your friend thinks it's okay to rape someone, tell him it's not, and that he's not your friend.
If your ""friend"" tells you he raped someone, report him to the police.
If your frat-brother or another guy at the party tells you there's an unconscious woman upstairs and it's your turn, don't rape her, call the police and tell the guy he's a rapist.
Tell your sons, god-sons, nephews, grandsons, sons of friends it's not okay to rape someone.

Don't tell your women friends how to be safe and avoid rape.
Don't imply that she could have avoided it if she'd only done/not done x.
Don't imply that it's in any way her fault.
Don't let silence imply agreement when someone tells you he ""got some"" with the drunk girl.
Don't perpetuate a culture that tells you that you have no control over or responsibility for your actions.
You can too control yourself.

"event","First update in a while. 
For a while I had a part-time job in a boat-yard trying to get money for advertising and to tie up loose ends untill I get more business - but now they dont need me so I got laid off. Need another part-time job - It was good to do something physical again. It will be difficult to get a collections job because most companies like to have a conflict of interests clause in their contracts. It will make it easier that I have a good CV and Im good at what I do. I really need something at night so I can actually spend time on my own business. What can I do at night? ....thinking quickly. Damn I hate christmas.
Saphrons Birthday at Shanghai Lil's last weekend was great! Seeing Saphron smoke pot was quite an emotional experience for me - altho it was only so she could pash up some other cute girly. Ended up staying so long that the carpark closed. Shanghgai Lil's is a great venue. Went back to Marks for a while and watched some crazy MTV cartoon that definately agreed with 2 lines of speed and an ""e"" I was on. Went back to the carpark and cos I was a little early I didnt have to pay. Sweet. I seem to remember lecturing Saphron's Uncle Goat about the evils of gambling. Goat is a cool guy. 
Spent most of this weekend with Tony and Anna. Friday night composed of drinking with them Peter, Erin and some of their friends. I dont remember the french girl's name but we talked about art and film for hours. Then Anna ran off and I went to find her cos no-one else did. We had a long deep-and-meaningful and she cried on my shoulder for a while - Anna is a genuinely sweet girl and Im glad to have her confidence. Anyway this happened untill a fight broke out in St.Lukes carpark across from Tony's and all sadness disappeared from Anna's eyes and we went to watch untill the 3 police cars and the Paddy wagon broke it up. 
For those who care on Saterday I sighted in my G22 laser scope at 75m. I am now accurate with it at that range to within roughly a 30cm diameter. This is much better than I expected of the sight, which has no magnification. As well as that two of my Dads newer rifles. One was a .177 centrefire, which is a really strange calibre. The ammunition although a small calibre has quite a charge, and very sharp slugs. Id like to compare it with the Hornet. Also his new Sterling .22 semi - which has a really nice feel to it despite being a Sterling. 
The rest of the weekend at Tony and Anna's was spent watching DVDs and people walking around the carpark, fencing, eating, planning to open a pet-cute-little-Japanese-lolita store (Anna's idea though with full approval) and a backyard plastic surgery clinic. I saw some guy do an ear reconstruction on TV once and I reckon I could do a better job on the cheap.
Dozo. Sayonara."

"event","Morrowind has kept me glued to my chair for the last week. I bought Everquest except I need a creditcard or sony gamecard to credit the account in order to start it off. Cant use parents because the dont approve of such games. I wont be able to get a credit card for at least another 6 months to a year. At least Im debt free now.
I DID however manage to get all my work done. Looks like I mightve got myself a couple of big jobs within the next couple of months and one of them is a lawyer - which is always a great mental challenge for me. Ill read up on the job info as it becomes available. And perhaps another asset recovery job or two which sounds tricky. Trickier than normal I mean. But thems the exciting ones. 
Suppose I should get myself GST Registered. Im thinking of calling myself SBRS - Small Business Receivables Services - targeting obviously small and medium sized businesses as a client base. I will offer ""regular"" services as well like warning letters. 
Ive toyed with a few logos. Perhaps I should talk to someone about that cos my aesthetic opinions tend to be a little grating to those of my potential market.
Started  doing up an internet site and have looked at advertising in the central leader.. Ill want to hit all of those newspapers and a few other avenues. Possibly Ill use the auckland commerce directory and cold-call them.. generally not well received way of advertising but..?
If this works out then Ill dispense with the police thing. Id actually really like it to work.
I want a home gym set. Im going mad doing hundreds of press-ups. I just set up my big bed again so can work on abs and back - situps. Im really glad my flatmate is interested in swordplay - even if not very seriously she is still an ok fighter. Very aggressive and quite strong for a girl. She has made some big improvements - but so have I. She is getting a bit shy now. 'Specially since shes tried punching me a couple of times and hurt herslf. Silly. Im looking forward to entering a tournament in a year or so and challenging some guys from my own school. That means I have to sort out a harness so as not to break any more bones. I have the time to work on that myself - and with Warren's help. Ive decided I want an English Gothic harness which because the English borrowed from both the Gothic and Milanese schols incorporates some enements from each - IE the cool flutework and fit of the gothic as well as the reinforced joints of the Milanese. Some of the guys are going for hockey gear. Missed two trainings in a row which means Ill have to catch up on a lot Sunday morning. Colin is good enough to fill me in in the morning next time. 
A bit hard-up right now because Im buying new office gear and just bought new computer. Work is also a bit slow again. I want an apartment so thats my big goal now. Thatll give me something to start with and Ill work up to land and house so as not to continue throwing away money on rent."

Taking on a few small business clients and running things from home. Other than setting up office and doing the porfolios I already have Im spending quite a bit of time developing business strategies to make my services a little more ""on the shelf"" to my target market and legally sound. BORING
But things are going pretty well. Im not going broke! And I have no boss!
No training today cos its raining. Studying the theories of the Englishman George Silver about human geometry the relationships between timing and distance. Test cutting was fun.
Reading History of New Zealand at the moment. Its dumb how little I know about the country I was born and live in.
Bought a new Box for $1k. It has an AMD 2.6GHz processor and 160 gig hard-drive to fit more music and films. DVD burner will come in useful. It looks like it has a jet intake on the front."

"event","Ive found a new place that Im pretty happy about. I started to think about what sort of place Id really like, and got an image in my head. Saturday night I got a phonecall from someone Id just met who said there was a room available. I looked at it, and its actually a lounge - with fireplace - wooden floor, etc. OK I imagined a self contained studio like this, but its goddamn close enough. Red lights, a tree, some appropriate art on the wall, cool furnature. Sussed. I want to stay there. Flatmates are Warren's girlfriend Amy, her cute cousin Linda who has a crush on me :), 3 kids and 3 cats. This is all acceptable. 

Old flatmate Carl has been given $50 million from tyco international to start a bank. cool. Now that my parents company is in a stable situation its only gonna take a couple of days a week. Im gonna do some sales work for Carl to fill the extra gaps. I can do this FROM HOME!! where I can not wear a suit, do a million pressups a day and not look wierd, and not have to set foot in a crusty office with all the pointless bullshit that goes along with it. This will tide me over till I sort other things out.

Got little brother watching Full Metal Alchemist. 

I hate not being able to talk about everything that goes on in my life. 

Life tends to always throw me in at the deep end so lets see what comes next..."

"event","I had a dream last night that two atomic bombs were dropped on the north shore last night. I was at the waterfront with some friends at someones very nice apartment/house or something (haha). It had a swimming pool outside. Something dropped from the sky and there was an explosion. Then another one right next to it.  They gradually formed into mushroom clouds and as I watched with a feeling of overwhelming futility and insignificance. The only thing I could think of was to jump into the pool. Oddly enough this meant that I survived - even though I felt like I had a really god-damn bad case of sunburn. Dream-logic.
   Later civil defense were making a statement to the public and we were told that greenpeace was behind the bombs. Apparently they had arranged it somehow so that the world realised the terrible reality of nuclear war whilst affecting only an insignificant percentage of the world population.
   I have no life.
   My dad was summoned to meet with the government about developing the WWA code of practice. Him and mum are wellington now. I am alone in their house right now in the middle of nowhere. I feel relaxed. Its great working by myself with no one else around. At lunchtime Im going to watch ""God's Gun"" starring Lee Van Cleef - classic bullshit spaghetti western. This afternoon Im going to shoot at some bakedbean tins with my new toy. It needs sighting in. There is lots of food in the house. There is a stupid friendly dog outside, and cats sleeping on the washing where theyre not meant to be. When I go out for a cigarrette I can watch the hawks circle over the surrounding farmland."

"event","Well now Im rearranging my parents company. I spent the last few weeks organising and collecting the bad debt ledger... well now ledgers.. and getting a feel for how the company works and its needs. The business is in a state of moving from being a small business to a big one that needs structured organisation, because its not just ""Mum and Dad"" that need to have a hand in running the business anymore. 
People need to be able to walk into roles and decipher a structure - So I am developing their accounts receivable systems to a point where an office person can walk in and run this side of things dealing with a minimum of the ideosyncracies inherant in a small business. Getting parents to understand some of the fundamentals of abstract business philosophy, such as a legal enitity, was not as hard as I thought it would be. Dad is more interested in the Operations side of things - making the trucks and diggers and stuff do their thing, as well as dealing with the bosses of other companies involved in projects. Mum tries her best to make sure everything else happens. The comapny is growing too big for that kind of administration to be effective.
Also looking at a fleet dispatch system. Meeting with the regional business development managers from telecom was interesting and the services they can offer are interesting and some of them are very useful. The system they offer allows for quick, easy, and comprehensive real-time logistic management and job organisation. In a company such as this one it is necessary to dispatch the right unit to the right job quickly, and more than occasionally under emergency circumstances.
So for what Im doing there Ill take 8% of whatever I collect plus any hours I spend doing manual stuff like driving trucks and arranging traffic plans etc. 
Found a two bedroom place in Karaka for $200/week inc. power. Need to find someone else to flat with. It will be good to live in the country again for a while.
Decided to join the police. Lots of press-ups etc at every spare moment. Need a swimming certificate and an updated first-aid cert. Need to be running. The police will give me access to as much relevant education as I need, as well as I wont be stuck behind a desk all day. I need to have a job where I feel like Im contributing to things I care about. I just cant get enthusiastic, much less devote myself, to simply making a buck."

"event","Rain and more rain. No horse riding for me today. Will look through the LMVD legislation, and play Freelancer. Thinking of importing cars.
Went and did my firearms liscence lecture last night. Was really classic listening to the mountain safety commisions masters at arms who ran it. Real mountain men. One big fat cockney guy who was the type who would pause after emotional statements to let information sink in, and the other was a skinny guy who acted like a support man trying to get a word in when he could. Its been a long time since Ive interacted with that type of person.... assumed roles are interesting. memories. I got one of the answers wrong because of carelessness - I crossed out the C instead of the D by mistake. 6 weeks and it should arrive in the mail.
Central Shooters is open any time after 7pm on Thursdays, and when/if you join the club I think you can go on a couple of evenings. All A and B class firearms may be used... I wonder what an indoor centrefire range is like? Perhaps I will also get my B class liscence for pistols.
Afterwards I met up with a friend of mine who is up from Dunedin. He is muslim and it is very interesting to hear his views. He has quite a wealth of doctrinal and historical learning. And we both think that animals are better than people. He has some quite interesting methods of discussion also... niether the academic style of argument or such THIS-IS-RIGHT statements as the fat anglican mountain man... Hes recently just landed a job as area sales manager down there for an agricultural company - which is a big step from being hired help. We watched the new samurai champloo episodes I downloaded and smoked from my yoda bong.
Sourced and downloaded .pdf of Flos Duellatorum (Flower of Battle), a very good 16th century fencing manual, as well as the works of Agrippa, who was a famous fightmaster but I dont know his work that well. Would really like to see a pictorial edition of ""Paradoxes of defense"" and ""Brief instructions on my paradoxes of defence"" by George Silver.
At the very least this week I want to test the proof of 1070 spring steel against musket shot, 16guage, and .22 fire. I was going to try with a .308 but last night I got to see the results of the same calibre against 10mm plate. If anyone comes accross someone who is firing 7.52mm/.308 ammunition, run away even if you ARE wearing plate armour of proof. I really need a digital camera. Now I have my arms liscence I can test the capabilities of different grades of ammunition. 
I wonder if I could DESIGN a .50 cal rifle - or get plans for one and alter it so that it met A catagory specifications. I know someone who would make it for me. I wonder how much I can get away with...."

"event","So fucking bored at work. Called my friend at lunch time to see how much hed pay me to do concrete drilling for a while, just so I can get out of the office. Will be a good opportunity to meet some new kinds of people. Christ I hate sitting on my ass all day. Didnt get anything done. Need a holiday. I suppose Ive worked for 5 months without one. Ill send my CV to the logistics guys tomorrow I think.
I sat daydreaming about getting some kind of camoflage tattoos full body, in blue and green. Maybe I should do BDSM armour... really crazy stuff. Looked at some of stueys armour in the medieval shop while on the prowl last night. His creativity seems to be waning, but perhaps he was quite limited anyway - in hindsight. SO LAZY. Why am I so lazy? Dont I know Im going to die? I need reward. It needs to be loved. I need an audience or something. Perhaps I should imagine I have one untill I get one... Also was thinking it might be cool if I had an artificial voice-box. Maybe if my asophogas gets amputated from smoking I could get an artificial one under the skin... with flashing diodes. Was also thinking what a steel mandable would look like... with shiny sharp teeth. I wonder if Id suit a mowhawk? I wish I could get totally different hair surgically implanted. I think Im getting over my normal phase... got what I needed from it. Dont feel like Im expressing myself. I need a synthesizer on my computer so I can record my ideas before I forget them.
Has anyone (not) seen preaching to the perverted? Itd be fucking cool to have a similar style of life... with slaves to do all the polishing and grinding... I could just do the forming. In the old days thats what wouldve happened... the apprentices etc did all that. The armourer pretty much formed and designed and fitted. Live off their paying for the priviledge, and performance art... Ive been trying to download some Lustmord but cant find any. I was seriously considering walking out of the office today... I was in a bad mood all day. Didnt cover up any of the companies fuckups and let whoever did it deal with it themselves and wrote off heaps of accounts. But also if someone was being a arsehole I nailed them. Its really funny listening to people try to play dumb, or avoid a point, or things like that.
Fuck Im manic.
Another recurring daydream I have is to walk away from everything and just keep walking around, like odin or something. I think Ill save that one for my middling years if Im still around.
The Law is an illusion. Order is an illusion. Its nothing. It just means I get to have a car and guns and stuff and seem responsible to everyone. The law is truely truely blind, and also truely stupid - the entity and body of lore called The Law - as opposed to the ideal of justice. The LAw is simply a force to be invoked at will by those who know how to use it. It is quite God-like. IE imaginary. Just the man in blue with the hitty stick aint so imaginary. By the way I downloaded a riot baton manual which is actually quite crude. ""Strike with a downwards motion - repeatedly - try not to kill someone"". Riot squads are cool though. Theyre quite effective - in manurewa. Mostly because noone offers them any organised resistance, they just walk over the top of anyone who gets in their way. And ignore the fucks who take advantage of the confusion to bottle cars and beat people up. But they look really impressive marching down a dead end street towards you in a one-deep wall formation.
Now going to bed. Have ben reviewing tracks for a collaborated playlist. Need to think of ideas for visuals too. We have some but I have some other ideas too."

"event","Party at Marks place on Friday. Fire. Sobreity. Topless axe weilding girls. Juraj and I carried a fucken couch around the block and some macho macho man firemen put the fucken fire out!! Consequently there is a couch on a street corner, somewhere out there, waiting ...
Saturday went to Matts place with Tony and co. Tony is getting a HAIRCUT. Thats gonna take some getting used to. Trying to get him to get his liscence is nearly impossible... he just doesnt want to learn. Matt and I had words and Matt has a car that would take a couple of hundred to get roadworthy, so I would fork out for this and teach him to drive to boot. ON THE CONDITION HE GETS HIS LISCENCE. Well see if that happens. Hope so for his sake.
LAter went to the viper club and had drinks with Juraj and Saphron. Conspired with Juraj while Saphron danced the night away. Checked out a cute girl. Saphron is trying to convince me to pick a religion. Considered being a dodgy catholic, and it was also noted that I am too uncharismatic to start a cult. I am happy with how my perpetually evolving worldview is developing. I draw on many aspects of many traditions. Each is holistically separate, but each highlights (or evokes) phenomena or concepts or whatever sometimes similar and sometimes totally different to each other. I dont really need to know that theyre The Truth, but they tell me how people have been influenced by them and what people have noticed about their world. This makes it easier to deal with people. It also gives me some good ideas. I am finite, changable, naive, not omniscient or omnipotent - but ultimately, I am god of my world - like it or not. 
Sunday I slept until midafternoon and then visited my great grandfather who turned 90 on saturday. He has Altzheimers and couldnt remember who I was, but we had a bit of a yarn anyway. From my parents reaction he opened up to me quite a lot more than to them - perhaps because I speak to him like a person instead of like a generic-old-person. Are people really conscious? I wonder.. I really hope I dont ever have my family taking care of me if Im in an accident or anything. It was interesting watching him with his friends... he has proposed to the nurse and has a wierd relationship going on with some lady 10 years his junior (ie 80). YUK she was going to kiss me me except I convinced her that Poppa Fred would get jealous - which she accepted gracefully. They talk about dying together and its astonishing how their mental resistance towards death is leaving them. Poppa Fred says he should be gone in maybe a month. once he said that ""there's still time left to get better.."" They seem to have a lot of fun, but I sense a lot of fear as well behind it.. but kind of accepted fear. It was an interesting thing to experience.

Question to all... do you beleive that I (or anyone other than yourself) am a lifeform independant of yourself? And not just an Ego projection to keep your true self from getting lonely? Do you really know your friends? Or do you ""objectify"" or box them to make them more digestable? Or do you just laugh at them like I do...?

Question 2 (Now that I think of it): How much of what you ""Know"" do you think/assume is ""obvious"" or inherent in the world? ie that ""everyone"" just knows or sees in the world. (Things like plasma being the fourth state of matter... :P)"

Last night Dejana turns up on my doorstep at close to midnight, ""Im so sorry I havnt kept in touch, that wanker (her boyfriend)smashed my phone!"" (Cries on my shoulder literally) What can I do? We went for a drive, had coffee and smoked a couple of joints and I rattled off advise to her which shell never take.. it appears our liasons will become even more covert. Mani has forbidden her to have friends, and she tolerates him still. Thats fine, were both late night people and I miss getting into trouble with her really. We have some cool little adventures, and some not so cool. Whats in her head? Her only idea of how to break up with him (ie FUCK YOU, FUCK OFF isnt good enough), is to try to get him to hit her, so she can call the police on him. That or shoot or poison him. Shell never learn... but can I talk? Well, que cera cera. I understand the situation - but I reject the notion that it is imperative. Circles. I cant do anything about them, so fuckin deal with it.. Let it never be said that I walk away from a friend in need.
Anyway I was talking to one of the big bosses at ADT and he is suggesting I put in my CV for some logistical stuff... sounds interesting. Ive had a little logistical experience, which we were talking about. I like problems (theres MY problem). ADT own armourguard and armourguard do cash transport. Sounds interesting. Maybe useful. Ill think about it... I could use a change.
Anyway time for another episode of shady night-life..."

Ive committed to working for at least another 2 years straightish to pay of multi-purpose/car loan. I will consolidate my debts, HAVE settled the other party from the accident, and will get insurance etc. 
Mixed thoughts about the vehicle... A 1997 Cefiro 2.0l v6. ...Its had a few technical hitches but nothing unsortable. Fortunately I know enough about that type of cooling system and Denerose's DAD helped me out on it heaps. Its nice, its a bit of everything I want in a car but I feel like I need SOMETHING ELSE. I can always sell it at least and still profit from the bargain. Thinking... CD changer, some tidy mags.. maybe thats all itd need? Well see... pentagram girl painted on the bonnet? I dunno ...
At work been moving around different portfolios, my boss is trying to keep me from getting too bored. Would kinda like to have some management experience before I leave that spot but I gotta keep waiting or maneuver someone outta their spot to get it.. I NEED MORE COMPLICATION!! FUCKING BORED!! Next time I think Ill work for Baycorp or perhaps Dunn & Bradstreet. Baycorp business info are a cunty company on the whole but its useful to know how they work. Ive managed to avoid a lot of debt like this. And then also they might give me some work a that will challenge me a little. Maybe Ill get into Evidence gathering again, or ideally skip-tracing which Im really good at and enjoy. 
Ran into my old mate gilbert the other day and hit him up about teaching me the Mandolin... I like the mandolin. Also FINALLY after three years he gave me a copy of his CD, which is really great. Gil is an excellent maker-of-stringed-instruments and also a sensitive musician.
Went to a 1920's goth party with Saphron and Juraj on saturday, and I liked this event. Nice place, everyone looked great. The 1920,s were a really styly period in terms of fashion. I sat and was antisocial with Juraj most of the night, and lookied at all the really cool things people were wearing. Oh wait I spoke to Chloe and Morgan, and I laughed and smoked pot over Carl who was paralitic on a balcony of dubious safety standards. This amused Tony (he has hated Carl since Ive known him). Perhaps I will have a full conversation with someone next time as at least I know some people there.
Commitatus are now folded and their instructors are doing courses in various arts now. This is great because I dont have to dress up like them, I can just receive the combat training. Fuck the territorials. I am waiting until they do ""German unarmed and grappling"" before I progress, as this encompasses some quite essential skills that I would like to master - such as thumb grabs and also bio-geometry. They have some really neat tricks. I had a brushup lesson in single sword the other day and its amazing how much Ive forgotten, but also how much my cut and my footwork have improved. This is entirely satisfying. 
Also this means my evenings can be devoted to relaxing and having a life - which I hope will start (has started) to become .. at least comfortable and functional now. No more drug fucked mafia princesses or sad little ####-***s or phantastic tyrades or psychotic strippers or christian family guilt trips, or .....anything else that fucks things up.
I think Ive quietly paid for my sins and my virtues by now."

Haste to the battle, quick to the field; Truth is our helmet, buckler and shield. Stand by our colours; proudly they wave! Were joyfully, joyfully marching to our home. Hark the sound of battle sounding loudly and clear; Come join the ranks! Come join the Ranks! We are waiting now for soldiers; who'll volunteer? Rally round the standard of the cross. Hark! 'tis our captain calls you today; Lose not a moment, make no delay! Fight for our Saviour; come, come awa! Were joyfully joyfully marching to our home. Fighting for a kingdom, and the world is our foe; Happy are we! Happy are we! Glad to join the army, we will sing as we go; We shall gain the vict'ry by and by. Dangers may gather - why should we fear? Jesus our Leader, ever is near. He will protect us, comfort and cheer. Were joyfully, joyfully marching to our home.""

Feel the Love y'all...."

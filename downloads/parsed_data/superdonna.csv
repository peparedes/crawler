"event","SO im at work and there are 30 other people at work and im sitting eating a sandwich because work bought subway for everyone and this guy chuch from corp. looked out the window and was like oh is anyone on that side of the street cuz they are giving out parking tickets. so i go and get my keys and see ernest standing by my car telling this fucking ugly ass woman that i was on my way. but she was giving me a parking ticket, and i was like ""i am moving my car right now."" and ugly ass woman was like ""its too late."" so everyone else that was parked on that side of the street got a chance to move their cars and i was the only person to get a ticket. HOw unfair is that? Everyone was like so did you get a ticket and i was like yeah and they were like oh that is too bad. it fucking sucks i am so mad. that is thirty dollars that i just dont have. I know that everyone hates getting parking tickets, but come on. Everyone else was parked on that side of the street why was mine the only one to get a ticket?  why does anyone have to get parking tickets at work? espesally if that is the only place to park? i dont just have 30 bucks to spend on that. I really dont think that if you get to your car while they are writing the ticket they should be able to give it to you. that is bull shit. grr."

"event","So it has been a really long time since i have wrote and entry! Mainly because my computer a really fucking load and i just didnt have the time or energy to sit here and wait for it to load. 
Now Let's see. Ernest is gone now until tuesday and i have realized that since i have been dating him, i have pretty much stopped talking to all of my friends. I think that sucks. I always said that if i ever got into a serious relationship I wouldnt to that. I LIED. I think that this weekend i am going to call up some people and say sorry and i love them and see if the want to get some coffee. Little steps.
So my dad is gone, but now nate and emilys dad, my ex step dad is in town. He tries really hard to be nice to me now. He sends me cards and presets and stuff for holidays. But it is really hard for me to forget how he was to me and my mom when i was younger. He was such a fucking ass! Being the sweetheart that i am, im nice back. THat pisses me off. 
Work is going alright. Everything there is pretty much the same. Except.. so i decided that i am going to go to Phish in April with a bunch of people and told my boss like 3 weeks ago. So a couple of days ago I found out that the biggest sale that we have the ""tent sale"" is going to to be the 3 days that i am gone. well they dont want to give me the time off, they brought up that fact that I wasnt there for Invintory. ANd i reminded them that for both this and invintory i have had my plans before they brought up either thing. I dont think that it is fair that they think that they arent going to let me go. They are like ""well do you really have to go to all three days?"" and i am like ""Yes"". it is stressful. It is fucking retail and i quit Best Buy for less.
So I went on a Cruise with my dad, we left from long beach and went to catalina island and encinats mexico. It was five days long. All and all i had a really good time. After i got over the fact that my dad is just weird and i should cherish the fact that he is my dad. We had a good time. I saw some dolphins, and sea lions. I read a whole book in one day. I got to see la boufadora, which means the blow hole. there are only three in the world. Its in MExico, the ocean rushes up into this whole that is on the side of the world and the presser that builds up shots the water out and it just kind of explodes, it was cool. I forgot my camera! FUck. Ate lots of really great food. they even had a soup Broclii and wisconsin chedder soup. that proves that wisconsin cheese is better!!! Anyway i dont want to start boring people. 
Thing are ok. They will always be ok. 
I LOVE YOU."

"event","Isn't it great that i can never do anything fucking right. when i try to help out in one thing i somehow forget something that isnt important to me but it is for other people. but when i try and fix it no one can seem to fucking help me. Im stupid! My boss asked me to work on friday because another employee called from his other job and said that he couldnt work this weekend. so my boss said that i could have thrusday off instead of friday. so i was like ok fine, they need me and i dont have to work six days in a row. well i forgot the ernest and i were going to watch a golf tournament on friday. so ernests feelings got all hurt. but in realitiy i was trying to help out work! and i could really care less about the golf. thing but so within three minutes after i said that i could work he got piss and i tried to work other stuff out. i suck. never mind none of this stuff matters and i dont know what i am so fucking pissed off about and i dont really know what i am talking about.

"event","Its monday morning and i am sitting at the computer with a cup of coffee and a cigerette as my dad sits in my living room packing for the cruise that we are going on in about 3 hours. Im half packed thinking i still have two hours to get ready and get the rest of the stuff i will be bringing into the gigantic bag that im bringing. Oh he's ready, wondering what im doing. I tell him, Im writing in my live journal. "" Your what?"" he says, ""my live journal."" ""your what journal."" i try to explain to him what a live journal is and he says, this magazeen was (bass player) talking about all the old bands that i still thought were still new like blink 1-7-3. I think that he really knew the name. Anyway. this is how i feel the whole week is going to be. Im not really complaining, i get to go on a cruise, pretty much all expence paid. And i get to hang out with my dad. But sometimes i wish that there would be someone else around someone to take some of the heat. He gives me a lot of heat. I guess that is just part of being an only child from a broken home. I really dont know. My Dad doesnt really have any friends. Sorry now i am just rambling. I will have a good no great time. I am excited to be going. Just a little aprehensive. Bleck.....See you guys in a week.
Nate if you read this dont forget to get the Phish tickets."

TO him i am just a little angel. I know i know, i am pretty angelic but five days alone with pops? i know that everything is going to be fine, its just a little weird. but we'll see what happends. something else that is exciting. greg from dharma and greg came into work today, i didnt get to talk to him but i saw him! i am still feeling ill i hate it. hopefully i will feel better soon.

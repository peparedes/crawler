"event","Alright so it's been over a year since I have written in this thing.
A lot has happened in the last year.
I drive.
I go to Hope.
I'm doing great with school, trying really hard to attend more.
I'm still with Chris. I love him.
I hang out with all of the same guys that I have been hanging out with the last 4 years or so.
I'm not as emo as I use to be. I'm a lot happier.
I get along with my parents. My mom is one of my best friends.
I'm really into doing hair. It's one of my passions since I have quit the guitar.
I think I am going to go to beauty school since I really suck at regular school.
I go through female friends like alcoholics go through beer.. unintentionally.. they all just hate me and turn on me, or move, or tell their mom I'm a druggie, or leave me for drugs, or stop talking to me because you went to fzw and I went to fzs, or because I go to Hope, or someone says you got me fired, or you find someone else, or I tell you things and you go tell your whole school I'm psychotic... or you know.. anything else. There is also Virginia. I love her. She's amazing.. she's not like most girls, that's what I love about her.
Guys are the way to go it seems they are the only ones that have stuck with me through all these years and don't judge you and would rather go out and have fun than sit and talk about other people.
I still don't hang out with people at school. Not since Teri left me. And as soon as I left South I started hanging out with people from there... huh.. weird how that works.
I've gone through two jobs. Over the summer I went forever without a day off. I quit one and got fired from another.. I have no money left so show from it. I need to get a new job so I can go on my first vacation this summer away from it all. I already got the OKAY from my parents. Go on a trip with the boys.

There is probably a lot more that's happened but I'm to lazy to write it. I will be using this more because my heads about to explode from not talking to anyone. That's the only thing that sucks about most boys.. more fun.. less talking.

Anyway, life is pretty good... I guess. ;)"

I am <b>not</b> ready to go back yet, I can always fake a stomach ache right?
I am so desperately hoping that I got into that school.
That would completely make the rest of my year.

Tuesday is my mothers birthday, I need to get her something still. Something beautiful because she deserves it. I just feel like going down and watching TV with her.

I don't have to work again till Thursday, after working a 10 hour weekend, which isn't bad. I just.. do NOT want to go back to that hell hole. (hell hole = school, not work.)

I feel like getting dressed up and going out and taking a billion pictures, and going out to eat. If I make it into the school, I shall do that. Anyone wanna join me?"

Just once I'd like to have someone to talk to.
Someone who even in the least knew something about how I feel.
No one I know does.
I don't even have anyone to talk to.
I have zero female friends.
I guess it doesn't matter anyway because no one reads these.

"event","I have to work today. Two-six. Middle of the day. No real reason I need to be there.. but hey, I need the money incredibly bad. I was thinking about getting two jobs. Yeah, the shoe store is nice and easy, but I need more hours.. and not random ones, and they just don't have any extra hours that need to be worked. I applied at some places in the mall because I figured it being Christmas time and all.. they'd need more help? Hopefully that will work out.

Also, I think I might possibly, hopefully leave South and go to the alternative high school in my district. You have to apply and have an interview to get there. You can't just.. go. It's not that easy. They don't want people who are just slackers and just want to go there for an easy way out. Well it's not an easy way out. It's just a smaller school. And I'm sick of people thinking I'm diseased just because I want to go there, and my parents are making me apply and whatnot.

I haven't been updating lately because I haven't had time, I haven't had energy. I read everyones, I just get to lazy to update my own, I don't have motivation. Imagine me at school if I get lazy enough just to update this journal. Ugh. I don't even have anything else on my mind. That was all."

"event","So yeah, I haven't updated in a while, and a lot has been going on. 

Ummmm.. hmm. So school has been going straight down hill. I never go. I'm never interested. The people suck. The teachers suck. The school building itself sucks. It's location suck. Yuck. I just hate everything about that school. I'll update on my plan on how to get out of it soon-ish...

Alright, well I had a bad panic attack last Tuesday night and I ended my ass up in the hospital. They put me on tranquilizers for the next couple days after that. Made me all goofy and mellow and just silly. It was neat, plus it made me really tired, getting outta school MORE! I loved it.. kinda. Anyway, so after that my mom thought it was about time to get me help. Sooo Monday I went to a therapist. She's nice. She treated me like an adult, because I've read up on a lot of mental illnesses, and it's really interesting. I was thinking about becoming a therapist or physcologist or a physcitrist myself, that or go into forensics. I like that kinda stuff. I don't know why, I'm a freak. Mkay, so saw her.. she said it sounds like there is a great chance I'm bipolar. So, today I went to a physcitrist, and she said it was like 80-95% sure I was, and it would only get worse as the years go on. It's incurable, and I'd be on medication the rest of my life, so it's better to start it now than before it's too late and it gets too bad. 

So, I get to test out this new medication. It's called Seroquel or something like that. (Pronounced: Zero-Quill) I liked the lady too, she knew her stuff and it was just really interesting. I mean take it I would have rather slept all day. But it was interesting to talk to those people, especially if I want to go into that department of health someday. She said the first two weeks, (AT LEAST) I'd be really depressed/sleepy /suicidal, but that's normal. That it only gets worse before it gets better. And if I get like that I should just go straight to the hospital. So, that's what's going on with me.

Oh yeah, so no one believes that I can make everyday of school till x-mas break. (which starts the day after December 17) Sooo, everyones betting me money. (if I lose.. I just lose not gaining any money, I don't have to pay them or anything.) But if I win, they have to pay me. I'm up to $125 dollars. No one believes in me. But it's okay, because I make out good with money then. That is.. if I make it...

The stats on that is: 

Jake - $50.00
Chris - $30.00
MY MOM - $10.00
Matt - $10.00
Joe - $10.00
Happe - $10.00
Blair - $5.00
Abby - $5.00

Total: $130.00

Joe said he'd give me $5 for effort no matter what. Haha. We'll see how that goes. 

My mom had to call the school and tell them that I might be really crabby and depressed, and that I'd prolly fall asleep a lot. I HAVE AN EXCUSE TO SLEEP THRU CLASS NOW!

Anywho! Today is Chris's birthday!!!! YAY!!! He turned 16. He went out and got his license today. He said he's coming to get me tonight to go out somewhere. I'm excited!! YAY FOR CHRIS!!


That's all I have to say for now. I'll update again later or something. NAP TIME!"

"event","Hmm, I haven't really written in this because I haven't had much time to myself.

Let's see. Last weekend was okay. What did I do? I don't remember what I did that friday but Saturday I had to work and then I went to CBC homecoming with Chris. It was a lot of fun minus the fact that I had a sinus infection.  After homecoming we went to Chris's friend Ryan's house. His house is amazing. It's three stories plus a basement. It's one of those old Victorian houses. Really neat. It has over 8 staircases in it. I got lost a few times but it still amazed me. I went on numerous tours of it. Chris's dad slept out in the car on Ryan's what seems like half a  mile driveway. He said we could stay as late as 4. Ha, we hung out in Ryan's basement till about 1-1:30 a.m. Then on the car ride home (which was about 45 mins - an hour.) me and Chris slept in the the backseat of the car. I fell asleep in his arms and he was kinda layin on me too. It was toooo picture perfect. I loved it. I loved the whole night with him. 

On September 21 it was two years for me and Chris. Not dating two years. But two years since the very first time we went out. 

Let's see, during the week I was even more sick because of my useless sinus infection. I hate being sick. Sooo much. So, Friday I had to work. It wasn't too bad. Mary and me didn't fight to much. Then I went home and Justin had called me. He was telling me how him and Darren were playing tricks on the other guys. (Chris is out of town this weekend on some Church thing again.. ) So, after he told me the story him and Darren decided they wanted to come pick me up and hang out for a while. They got to my house at about 10:15 and we had a blast, to much fun to even type about. I love having friends like them, they just constantly are making me laugh. 

Saturday was fun also. I had to work from 10-2 and then my family came and picked me up and we went to my g-ma's house. Then we went down the road to see my great g-ma. She's in the NHC nursing home. It's soo nice there. I'm glad she's being taken care of. They have this cute little ice cream parlor where they have booths and stuff and it looks exactly like the old time parlors. We all sat in there and are. It was nice and relaxing. My g-ma was telling us all about this place that my great g-ma (Who has the coolest name I've ever heard, Zelpha.) was staying at. I walked around to look at it more. It was soo sad seeing all those helpless people there. There were people with everything imaginable wrong with them. They all just seemed to sit there. Soo lifeless. I started to choke up a little bit. We went back to my g-ma's house and she gave us a pie, and we went home for lunch.

I got home and Joe called. He asked me if I wanted to hang out. So, he picked up Justin and me and we were gonna go to hooters with everyone. (Justin, Joe, Darren, C.J., Blair and some Kyle kid I didn't know.) There was to long of a wait though. So, we decided to go to JJ's and we ate there for no apparent reason. Justin and Joe got the biggest thing on the menu. The people who work there said that they have only seen two people the entire time they have worked there finish the whole meal. Well they doubled they record. It was amazing. Haha. 

After that we needed something to do, so we all came back to my house and crashed for a while. It was fun. Justin, Joe and CJ left to go pick up some other ladies and hang out with them at about 10:30. Then Blair left a little bit after that to go hang out with some dude. There was Darren and me left. We layed on the couch for a while watching South Park and at around 11ish he left. I fell asleep a little while after that.

I had to go to work today at 1. It was really slow and then it started to pick up at a nice steady pace. It was nice. It went by really fast. I came home around 6 and my mom, Matt and me all went to the high school to see this completely totaled car. It was from a girl that was drinking and driving. She was killed. It was really sad. 

I'm home now. I don't know what kinda mood I'm in. I'm kinda in that lonely mood. I'm just kinda here. I don't know what to make of it. I'm suppose to go to a homecoming next week, at Duchesne. I'm not sure if I'm 100% going yet or not. I'm not sure if I want to. I'm kinda in that mood right now where I feel like.. I'm not wanted or anything. Everyone is finding someone. I'm just kinda here alone. Well, not .. I don't know. I just don't know. I'm gonna leave this at that."

Sit around, and do it again the next day. Till Wednesday and then I have to work. Which reminds me I need to call Bart and reschedule my lesson. I don't know if I'm nervous or not. I'm just kind of upset because I am on my period as of this morning.

Yesterday I hit major depression mode. I hated it. I went all insane. I didn't feel good at all. Some friends made it better and we went out to the B.B King concert down at the arch. It was amazing. I loved it. After the show, they had a firework and laser show. I enjoyed it a lot actually. After the show Mr.Wetter took Justin, C.J, Chris and me all over to Blair's. It was about 11:45 p.m. by the time we got there. We hung out and watched movies till about 3:30a.m. and then the guys left. Blair and I fell asleep about 5ish, woke up about 9-9:30 and went out and got donuts. They were on the house because Blair knew someone that worked there. Then I had to go to work.. I got really sick and had to leave early. This is why I hate having a uterus. It stops me from making money.

I'm kind of in a mixed mood right now. About everything actually. I don't wanna complain.. but I don't know what else to do.. and this is what I use this journal for. This school year is gonna be a challenge. I have to start actually going to school.. keeping my grades up and whatnot. I also have to keep up with work.. and I still need to make times for friends. They are what I live for. I wouldn't wake up and do the things I do everyday without them.

I've been having emotional break downs the last few days. I don't even know how to explain them.. just the whole.. not being good enough.. what's wrong with me sort of things. 

There is so much I wanna write about but I don't even know where to start. I guess when I find the words.. I'll be back. For now I need to sleep or something.. school in the morning. *shivers*"

I'm suppose to pay $12 a month for it, which isn't bad at all now that I have a job. (Supermarket of Shoes, if you were wondering where) But somehow he got it to where the first three months are FREE for me. Which is exciting. It's a family plan sorta thing, and he got one for himself and two extra lines. One for me and one for my g-ma. So there are 1200 minutes! for us three a month! Not bad at all.. and that's with nation wide long distance. His line is 49.99 a month.. not bad.. and then with two extra lines like only like a total of 70 something a month.. and his company is paying.. which isn't bad at all for 3 phones and 1200 minutes. That's astonishing. 

Anyway, Chris comes home today. I'm not sure what time.. but I'm excccciteeeeeddd!! I've miss him sooo much. :D. Then I have work from 5-9:30. Not that bad.. but it's moneeeeey! Mkay, gonna go now. Home alone and lovin' it."

So, Chris isn't really allowed to hang out with me anymore. This is so fucking stupid. This is the second person who got ripped away from me due to parents. I'm so sick of parents telling their kids who they can and can't hang out with. This is sooo fucking .. grrr. First Darren, now Chris. The two people who meant the world to me... I mean, Darren's now allowed to hang out with me.. 6 and a half months later.. and his parents still won't let me in their house.. or him here unless I'm havin a huge party. He can call me again, which is nice, because when I was really down about the Chris thing, Darren helped me see that.. it happened to us too.. and It'll hopefully get better, because I mean what happened with us was kinda worse than what happened with Chris.. so I don't know. I miss my Chris. :( He's gone till Sunday anywho.. then he's leaving again Wednesday to Cancun.. :( which sucks because I havn't gotten to go ANYWHERE this entire summer. I never get to anyway I don't know why I'm complaining.


On a better note, Supermarket of Shoes called me back asking me to come in for a computer interview. I went in did the thing.. and the next day, Friday.. yesterday.. they called me back saying they wanted me to come back in for a face to face interview.. so I must have done something right.. so I'm going in Monday for that. I'm excited. My mom's being a hoosier about it tho. All I asked for was a new shirt for it.. and she won't because she's ""saving her money"". Which is a crock of shit.. because <i>she</i> herself has no money... and can afford a friggin shirt.. I'll need it anyway for Wednesday we have school registration and pictures... Oh well, when I get a job.. I won't need her anymore. 


I dyed my hair again, I'll put up a picture of that in a wee bit.

Okay, so my brother had a friend over.. and I had gone out that night. right before i went out this guy was following me around my house.. i left.. and when i got in the car on the way home they were there.. and we went out to eat.. and then came back here. so this friend of my brother was all, hey let's drink! and I was all, eh, i dont think thats such a good idea.. and he was pouring shots for both of my brothers. matt was drunk and so was adam.. and i came in my room and sat on here.. the guy kept bringing in shots for me.. and I really didn't want to... but after i got bored online.. i was thinking.. hmm i dont know should i? well, i ended up taking at least 3 shots.. I drank those up and i went into my room.. rather sooner than later i noticed it was about 1 a.m. and the kid came in my room telling me my brothers had passed out... and I was like.. hmm okay. and he had brought in a bottle of vodka at that point, and he sat in my room talking to me.. and it was really awkward, and i wanted him to leave.. but I didnt want to be rude.. so i kept drinking to make him fade away.. turns out i was completely trashed.. right. well he was trying to get my to have sex with him. saying things like ""I know you are on your period but we can still have sex if we're careful."" and ""i just got outta an engagement so im not looking for love, but someone to make out with"" and ""how much do i have to get you to drink before you use that lamp over there as a pole"" and ""i can tell you're going to be a stripper when you're 18"" and he kept telling me to sit on the bed with him.. but i didnt want to.. i was content in my chair... even thought i really didn't have any feeling left in my body.. (keep in mind this fucked up boy is 22 years old) eventually it became about 4 a.m. and i was rolling around on the floor begging for more alcohol.. and my dad comes walking into my room screaming to go to bed.. and the guy leaves.. i dont think i touched him.. im soo scared if i did.. so i ended up taking over 40 something pictures of myself when i was drunk.. and making movies of it.. i eventually made it to the bed.. and for about 2 hours straight i was puking up on myself all over the place... i had had way to much to drink, i remember choking a bit on some vomit.. but I seem to be alive.. I woke up to the phone ringing.. there was puke everywhere.. i mean everywhere.. all over my walls all over me all over my floor and my blankets and pillows.. and it wreaked.. and i fell over onto the floor.. it was about 11 a.m. and i started crying, and my brother got online from his room.. and i told him what happened after he passed out.. and he brought me some water.. when he came to my door he was telling me how bad it smelled.. and all i could do was lay on my floor and cry, i called chris and i was bawling my eyes out.. he started panicking.. and it just made me cry more.. i got off the phone with him because his parents wouldnt let him come see me, and they made him go somewhere and he wasnt allowed to call me or talk to me for the rest of the day.. I finally got myself up and somehow got into the shower, i sat there for about 45 minutes.. I didnt know what to do with myself.. i finally got out.. and i looked around my room.. and i started screaming ""oh my god"" because of all the vomit all over my room. i fell over and started puking again.. disgusting.i just laid on the floor for a while, and my dad came up screaming at me ""WHY WERE YOU TRYING TO FOOL AROUND WITH THAT BOY"" and i just looked at him and started crying because it was the exact opposite.. and he didnt know that.. and I didnt want to tell my parents because they wouldnt trust me with my brothers anymore.. and it just.. i left him alone.. and my friend tomazi and amanda came and saw me and they still found puke in my hair and picked it out for me.. and i just kinda teared up.. and joe came over.. and we called some people.. and then they left and i started feeling bad again so i slept for a while.. then tried to eat and then puked again.. i laid in the bathroom for like 30 mins.. and then went to sleep... i had the worst hang over.. and the second worst night of my life.

There is trouble with the trees,
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas.

The trouble with the maples,
(And they're quite convinced they're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light.
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made.
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade.

There is trouble in the forest,
And the creatures all have fled,
As the maples scream ""Oppression!""
And the oaks just shake their heads

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights.
""The oaks are just too greedy;
We will make them give us light.""
Now there's no more oak oppression,
For they passed a noble law,
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe, and saw.


Rush - The Trees



That pretty much sums it up right there."

"event","I dunno what's wrong. I had a really bad night last night. I was up till about 4, laying on my floor watching the fan and listening to music. I finally fell asleep in a pile of myself. I had a really bad dream. It was my acting teacher from school, and he came up to me in the halls and drove me home. It was at school, only it was a different school. We were driving home and he had some papers we sat in the street and he kept repeating over and over that I was a failure, a failure at life. That I was academically challenged. Basically, I wasn't going to amount to much. He told me the only good grade in any class I would ever get would be in Gym, something about that's all kids these days think about. I started crying really hard in the street, I woke up in a cold sweat.. crying.. crying extremely hard. There was a bit of blood in my pillow from my tears (I have some condition when I cry really hard I sometimes break little vessels near my eyes and my tears come out like blood, creepy.. you don't have to tell me, I know.)

I felt so down about myself. I kept thinking to myself. What am I gonna do? What am I suppose to do next? I feel like I'm failing myself and everyone around me. 

I don't even trust anyone anymore. The only person whose been loyal to me is Joe, and if he hasn't hes done a great job at hiding it. Most of the others have some sort of imperfection.. like lying, annoyance, ignorence, talking behind my back, are just plain idiots or just stopped talking to me altogether. Ugg, I need to make more friends.

I've had this stomach ache the last few days, and today my head a bit now also.

I've been cleaning all day. Trying to do something for once. I cleaned the whole house, minus my brothers rooms. I vacuumed everything even the stupid stairs, my parents room and their bathroom. I mean just sometimes I wish I had an elevator. I didn't do the basement or the garage. I do plan on sweeping out the garage tomorrow anyway. Dad told Adam if Matt and me start doing regular volunteer work around the house he'd give Matt the dell, and me this 'ere laptop. That'd he'd buy himself a new laptop (off limits to the rest) and wireless Internet so we can have the computers in our rooms. 

Also, my birthday is coming up 17 days, not counting today. I don't know if I'm excited. I'll be 16. I was stupid and waited to long to get my permit so, I can't get my license quiet yet. I wanna look into getting a job though. I think it's kinda better for me to get the job before a car and stuff so that way I can put some money toward a car to get a better one, as compared to a crappy one just from my dad. Plus, I want some extra money for myself, and I'll have that so that it won't all just be going to insurance. Dad also said he might get me a cell phone. Er, I begged him for one for my birthday. I've been proving him more and more it would be more convenient for me to have one. I think he's going for it. It'd be really nice to have one.

What else. Hmm. Arg. Mom's been pissing me off. I won't go into details.

I guess I'm gonna go play guitar. I'm getting better, I'm really proud of myself. I'm gonna try to work harder on that also. Make use of my summer, instead of mope around."

Let's see, mmm a couple weeks ago I got really sick, and my mom finally called the doctor. So, I went in on Tuesday, they said they wanted to do tests and the did the weight and all that. I'm 98 lbs now. <b>I'm fucking disgusting.</b> Then they wanted to do blood, so I went down the that part of the office and the lady said, ""Mmmmkay! We're gonna needa do a coupla tubes tadayy"" (all black-like) And I asked, ""....How many is a couple..."" She replyed, ""About 4."" I was like.. wtf? and I looked at the tubes and they were HUGE, they were seriously about 4-5 inchs long and about 1/2 and inch around. So, after about 5 minutes of sucking all my blood out, she put that little cotton ball thinggy that they do over it, and I started blacking out, I couldn't see anything, everythin was blurry.. I could barly hear anything anyone was saying and I broke out in a cold sweat and fell over the table a couple minutes later, all I remember was being carried off and fanned down, Then waking up in a strange bed. I came home and I could see still and I was stumbling around and I had the wooooorrrrrrsssssstttt headache. 

So I go back to school, and everyone is giving me shit. 
""Did you do this, did you do that? Where were you, ew sick? Um.. why did that happen, are you anarexic?"" Bitching at me for all sorts. That was Thursday. Friday eh, I don't even remember what happened, then I went to the movies, I guess that was okay? I'm on medication stuff now.. it sucks. 

Saturday was one of the worst days. Everyone blew me off (again) Chris and me got in a huuuuugeeeee fight (again). He keeps lieing to me, and I can't stand it. He says he wants to make it up to me, but he always says that. I don't even know anymore. He told me he either wanted to be friends only or a couple, no more of this friends with ""benifits"" and I understand, I just don't know what I want, I mean I love him to death but.. I don't wanna hurt him.. even though he has me. I just wanna be alone for a while. I don't want to be at school, I don't want to be around anyone I just need to be .. alone. Figure some things out. I'm just sick of being blown off. <b>Everyone</b> has beed blowing me off. I just feel so.. <b>rejected.</b>

Anyways.. not going to my brothers this weekend anymore, moving that to next weekend, meaning I wanna get out and do as much this weekend as I can. Chris is going outta town next weekend too, for lacrosse. Makes me not feel as bad for leaving. Hmm, I wonder how this is gonna turn out.

I cried the rest of the night till about 3 a.m. I don't even really know exactly why.. so much was going on.. and so many people were bothering me. I can't stand it when people cuss at me. Even if it's not directed toward me, when its in the box when I'm talking to someone.. I get pissed and I don't know why. I have the shortest fucking temper. jahsdkasdl .. can't you tell?

I don't know what wrong. 

God, I hate how when I sleep in and wake up, I have the worst fucking head ache. Always.

Oh and my dad wants me to go to the David bowie concert with him on May 11th. It's on a Tuesday.. so maybe I can just skip school the next day.. I'm hoping at least.. 

Also, Brad had an extra ticket to the Blink concert, I'd have to pay him for it.. but at least I'd know I'd have a ticket.. Rachel said I could crash at her place the night before and go with her and her friends. I might just do that. I dunno if I'll even be able to go :/ my brothers birthday is the day before... but they should understand.. I've been in love with Tom since fifth grade.. even if I don't really care for their music as much anymore."

"event","Yes, so. um. Tuesday as I said  I hung out with Lindsay. Wednesday, I had Chris, Kyle and Mitch over, and Thursday I had to go shopping with my grandma.. I got a couple things no big deal then Chris had a buncch of people over. It was, Chris, Joe, Mitch, Jon, Dan, Darren, Justin, Nathan, Sam and me. Kyle was wondering around most of the time. Silly kid. It went pretty well actually, not half as boring as I thought it would be. I figured like always I'd sit there bored, yadda yadda. But I got up and did things, go me? Sam spent the night here, left at about noonish? Then I went to Chris's with Mitch and got home about 6:15. They all went to some Magic Booster at the mall, and considering I don't play I came home and now am bored. I think Kelly and Brad wanted to do something tonight, but Kelly keeps disappearing. Brad has an extra ticket to the Blink concert and asked if I'd like to join, so I guess I'm in on that? That's not till May 15th tho, and if I have to pay anymore than 10 bucks for it, then I'm out. 


I dunno but right now I'm kinda depressed? I'm just outta it.. lotta stuff going on. 
Lotsssss of stuff on my mind and I'd type it.. but then again I don't want people knowing? So, what would the point of that be? Hmmmm...."

"event","Well, yesterday I had my lesson, then I wasn't feeling so great, and turns out I was running a fever, so instead of going to Lindsay's like I had planned I came home.. and took some pills. I started felling better and Kelly came over and we walked up to McDonald's and I saw like 5 people from school.. arg. We came back and were bored so we called Lindsay up and her and Cat came and picked us up, Sam was in the car too. We were thinkin of places to go so they could smoke, we went to a park thing and we saw some old people open their windows and were on the phone so we split. We just drove around for a little over an hour just taking random turns and getting ourselves lost. :) They were passin a pipe around. Anyways, after that we took Sam home and went back to Lindsay's for a while and watched t.v then Cat took Kelly and me back home. He's actually.. pretty hot annnnd goes to my school, and even made me sit in the front with him :). 

Today seems pretty boring, I was gonna have people because my dad's outta town but my mom is all, ""I'm not prepared"" and I told her I'd clean and stuff shes like, ""No, I'm not mentally.. prepared"" and I was like.. WTF!? Anyways, I need to get out.. I don't want my mom turning into a mental case on me. Blah and my head hurts soo bad again."

"event","Alright, so I've been on spring break.. and grounded. So Friday I watched movies all night, Saturday went shopping with my mom and colored all night, and Sunday? Oh, I cleaned :-/. Monday I had an Ortho and then Chris came over, and we hung out all day.

So my breaks been more boring than not so far. I dunno what I'm even gonna do the rest of it. Probably nothing because that's how things usually work out for me. I have a lesson today, I even moved it from Wednesday night to today so just in case I had something to do tomorrow, hmm.. pathetic? M'yes? Sure. 


And that's the way the cookie crumbles."

"event","I've had a reallly bad day today.
I was not ready to wake up at alllll this morning... I had to go to gym first hour and I tried to sleep but it did nothing for me.. then we had to do that career thing and it was the most boring two hours of my whole life, all we did was walk around and write shit about jobs none of us have any intention of doing.. then we had lunch and I found out I forgot my money so .. I had to go hungry.. then 4th hour some seniors decided it'd be funny if they sprayed fart spray in the main office and all the classes had to evacuate because people were puking the smell was so bad. 5th hour.. borrring.. same with 6th. Then I had to walk home in the cold. I came home minding my own business.. and my mom left, and I walked into the livin room and I heard a *SMACK* on the window and I thought someone threw a paper wad it was white marks left.. and a bird hit the window and I looked down and it broke it neck and I started to cry.. it was so helpless.. and he couldn't move and it was just laying there.. and I mean I know it was stupid to hit a window.. but he couldn't help it. Matt had to close the blinds so I wouldn't look at it anymore. My mom came home and the first thing she said is, ""WHO CLOSED MY BLINDS!?"" and I told her what happened with tears in my eyes and all she could say was.. ""..Did you dad call yet?"" and she sneaks off to her bathroom. I had to ask her something really important and I knocked on the door, and she said, ""I'M BUSY!"" so of course shes in there token it up.. god damnit, do something with yourself woman!


Dad comes home, I come downstairs and I walk up next to him while he's on the computer, and he says ""Clean up this cat puke..""
And I said no.. Jokingly. and he goes all physco on me.. and screams at me then got up and shoved me into this shelf thinggie next to the desk cuttin up my leg, and i go and get the stuff and clean it up and he's on the phone with some bank lady telling her how crabby he is? so I go up to my room and do my homework and he comes up there like 20 minutes later and he's all, DAMNIT SARA WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE ME YELL, and then he looks at my room and starts screaming why isnt it clean, and i told him it was one of my projects for when im grounded, and that made him more mad, he eventually left, im just so fucking sick of him, he doesn't care about us hes never home hes always yelling at all of us hes so stupid. ahdjahksdaksdhadalsdgajsd then I got yelled at by my mom cuz I was listening to head phones in my room and couldn't hear her when she called me for dinner.. like i'd fucking wanna eat with them anyway.. I'm gonnna diiiiiiee this weekend :(

"event","Thursday was the play. it was awesome. 
Friday, chris, lindsy and terri came over and matt had his friend matt over. that was pretty awesome too.
Tonight, I went to the mall with Joe, Mitch, Jon, some CJ, Darren and Lindsy. May I say, worst fucking night. I was soo pissssed it wasn't even funny. Chris didn't wanna go. It's okay. I had to give the guys a ride home, and they all went to Chris's and I made Joe go get Chris for me so I could give him a hug and say hi. When Chris came walking down the driveway I ran up and gave him a big hug and he spun me in circles, that completely made my night. I was crying so hard in the car ride home, and I'm crying even harder now thinking about it. I don't know what to do. I need to just give up on Darren or something.. it's killing me, and I swear to god if he even fucking calls me a whore again.. joking or not.. I'm gonna jack him in the nuts. 

blah, sara get over yourself and shut the hellll up."

saturday, had Amanda, Terri and Liz over. It was okay I guess, I warned them it'd be boring but no one ever listens to me.
Sunday I dyed my hair and layed around. Fell asleep naked watching some Michael Jackson 30th anniversary thing... don't even ask.

Today is Monday. I went to school. It was interesting. I had fun in some classes. Chris came over right after school. We went to sonic and then came back here for a while. :) I had to take him home at 6 and then I got KFC. That was my day."

"event","You ever have times where you think you know your emotions and then you check them over one last time and you find a flaw? Ya, thats me right now. 

So I like this person, and I don't really know why I'm saying person b/c Joanne and Katie are like the only people who read this and they already know, but for the sake of trying to be sneaky, lets keep it without names....

Anyway, we went out with some other people and had one awesome time.  Then we got together again and had another awesome time. We're really comfortable with each other and I feel like I can be myself with him. But I can't figure out A) If he likes me or B) If I really like him or if it's just my silly hormones.
And I don't have the balls to go up and ask him if he likes me or anything.
And if we never get beyond friends thats totally cool with me, I would probably like that just the same as anything else. 

I just would like to know what I'm allowed to do for my next move.. Does that sound weird?
What I'm  trying to say is, do I ask him on a single date, or is it still too early for that? I'm new to this whole liking someone thing and have no idea what to do. 

I feel weird.

I'm not sure what to think of this whole situation, cuz when I'm around him I love who I am. Except sometimes I can get too shy and then othertimes I feel like I'm being too forward or involved with stuff. Ahh.

The only other time I've really liked someone was in the 4th grade, and that was when it was cool to have your best friend go ahead and write the poor boy a silly note, or start dropping hints. I feel like I'm now in the grown up world of romance. I'm on my own. It's up to me and me alone. I decide what I want to do and live with whatever the outcome.

Wow. A serious journal entry for once. Forgive me if I sound like a little emotion filled girl, wait  that's what i am. Ha!

On a different note, me and my little accomplice have decided that my alter ego is a ruthless and angry dictator who has no idea what  to actually do as a dictator but knows that you have to be really, really angry at everything.

"event","So I'm sitting up in the study on the third floor and the only light that is on is this very non - bright one. The wind is blowing because there is a thunderstorm on its way, so the curtains are blowing out into the middle of the room. And the wind is making this high pitched wailing noise when it goes through the screen... and I feel like i'm on the set of a horror movie. Do not fear though, I am not afraid, though I shal pretend to be, just for the sake of the moment.....

My hands are shaking so badly that I'm finding it hard to type even the simplest of words.
I'm not sure my ear drums can withstand another shrieking holler from the wind outside.
But wait, that wasn't the ordinary windy noise that the wind usually makes... it sounded more life like...
I slowly arise from my comfy orange squishy chair and pace toward the window facing east. 
(ohhh this is getting good) 
But before I can make it to the sill, the wind picks up again, blowing the curtain into me, and disabling my ability to see anything. The sound of the wind is ringing through my ears, I cover them with my hands to stop the pain, but somehow it seeps between the cracks of my fingers and trickles into my head. Oh the pain. I try to fight it but it becomes to much. I feel myself losing conciousness, I can't bear the though of passing out and falling on the blue carpeted floor. Which could also have potential to bruise my perfect complection. But then, just as sneekily as it began, the wind stopped and the curtain slowly sank back to its position against the wall. I decided not to look out the window and down into the blackness of my yard, for whatever was out there, I wanted no part of. When my breathing returned to normal, I cautiously made my way back to the chair in front of the desk. Once my bum (ha, i said ""bum"" in a horror story)was touching the squishyness of the chair, all feelings of safety and comfort flowed back into my system. However, it was not before pondering what just happened did I continue typing up my essay, and still to this day I can never quite account for what happened that night.


Wahoo! How'd you like that. I know I know, pure genius. What can I say..??
No, really, what  can I say?

Only that I am Sam Hough;
Singer, Comedian, Stunt Double, Extraterrestrial, Buddist, Elephant Trainer, Astronaut, Deck Swabber, and now... Author.

~By the way, today was a very good day. Sometimes just a little hug is all that needs to happen to me to make my entire day seem wonderful. *Ahhhh.

"event","Okay, so like an hour ago or something like that i was really exhausted, but now... I'm shaking with excitement! (and I really shouldn't be) So me and my family went out for ice cream at the Ice cream factory. We were on our way home and all of a sudden a cop's lights start flashing. I pull over to the curb and notice that the cop pulls over with me. My dad yells, ""Oh, Sammy's getting pulled over!"" I kinda start to get nervous and stuff. Then the cop came over and flashed his flashlight in my eyes and asked to see my permit and junk. Turns out I forgot to signal at the light. I say, ""Are you sure, because I definetly remember signaling."" He goes, ya, i don't remember seeing a signal, but don't worry, I'll just give you a warning and you can use it for firewood if you want to.

*A big sigh of relief came from me.

As I pulled away, it hit me that I had just been pulled over for the very first time. 

Wow.

It really perked me up because it wasn't for anything serious and technically speaking, I didn't do anything wrong cause I did signal at the light.

So ya, I may still hate marching band but right now, I don't care. 

Wow.

That was just what I needed to cheer me up ~ weird huh?

I hate marching band this year. Yes, hate. 

I've been thinking about quitting but I know that is totally not an option for me. 

I want to love it as much as you guys do. I want to have the best section ever, and be able to have fun while playing. unfortunatly that is not the case.

I was sooo looking forward to this year with band and stuff. But I can't wait for the football season to end. I can't take my rookies anymore. They're driving me CRAZY!

And it seems like everyone is getting their music except me. Which sucks because I'm section leader so I feel like an idiot when I can't play four notes in a row. I hate the music this year. I mean really really really hate it. I'm sick of Stamas being a stupid band director and taking credit for things he doesn't deserve. I'm sick of playing and replaying measures and not being able to play them 5 seconds later. I'm sick of telling little boys where to stand, how to play, how to read music, not to bicker, etc...
Right now, my brain is beyond its music capacity. 

My brain works like a cabinet. It can only hold so much until someone comes along and takes a few papers out and puts them to use. Right now, the music section is full and the drawer is overflowing which prevents anyone from closing it, which cause the wind to blow some of the papers out and into a far off place. I need the weekend to sit and organize my cabinet. Look through it and take out the old music files and label the new ones with bright highlighters. And until I am able to smoothly close the drawer, I don't want to think about marching band. 

This is going to be a tough year. 

now i must go bond with my family and get some ice cream.

I'm sooo angry that I missed the concert. Hope it was fun and truely amazing! I wanted to be there so bad. I miss all you guys, I need to see you before school starts. How about mini golfing or a movie sometime? I know that by just typing it out on my livejournal it will never happen, but I can try. Hm. Yeah, I want to go to the movies, and mini golf. Sounds good. maybe i'll take myself. oh wait... I DON'T HAVE MY LICENSE!!!  You know what? I realized my problem is that because I don't have the ability to drive others around, I feel dumb asking them if they want to go anywhere. I feel bad being like ""Hey let's go see a movie, by the way, you're driving."" I hate that.     

Oh yes. Katie, I still haven't recieved my cowboy from your western adventure. I've checked the post office and mailbox several times and come back disappointed.

The fox came and killed a bunch of our chickens and it left little piles of entrails (spelling) all over the yard. I felt like I was in the Village, you know the part with the dead dog things?  Ya. Oh, and the more hick thing that happened was my brother got mad at it so he went in the woods with his bee bee gun and hunted it. The weird thing is he found it and shot it in the back or something. Don't worry, it was just a bee bee gun so it didn't hurt it but still, how hicksville can one family get?

Okay, hmm... we (me and my bro and sis) went to the rainforest cafe today. It was fun, until we got lost trying to come back home. 

As for more summer fun, well, I think I'd get shot by Joanne if I told you guys the entire story of what we did, but here's a less intense version:

Baked bananas
Went hunting
Got in touch with our inner African heritage
Became part of an African tribe
Had loads of laughs!

Then I had my sprts day thing, which totally bombed out but we still had fun. Only Joanne Wheeler, Dave Urbanowski, Erin Howard, Tim Crory and his brother showed up. We didn't actually play any sport for the lack of people. Then we decided to go to the mall and hang out, but the ""Curse of the Howards"" prevented that from happening. So we went to go see the fantastic four while Erin brought her broken van back home. The movie was good and so was the company. In all, thanks to the people who came and buckets of poo to the people who didn't. Hope every day is as fun as those past two were. Oh, and congrats to Joanne on finally getting her license.!!!!

One day, a Giraffe was walking down main street, and decided to roast some bananas. However, he had never done this before and required the assistance from his dear friend Hippopotamus. On the way to Hippo's house this Giraffe noticed in the window some very nice curtains and decided to make some, since he was a compulsive fabric buyer. Hippo happened to be walking down the street and saw the Giraffe attempting to create his curtain entourage. She said ,""Some nice curtains you got there"". ""Why thank you"", said the Giraffe. They went to Starbucks and bought coffees (because those types of animals love to drink coffee, next time you go to the zoo, look at their ""water""). They saw Mickey Mouse making out in the back room with Daisy Duck. Minnie was in the front room sitting with Goofy. They pondered whether or not they should say something to Minnie, but decided to be evil friends and remain silent, while whisking away the curtain separating the front room from the back room. Mickey was revealed... Minnie saw him, and screamed ""Bloody Murder!"" (In a british accent, because disney characters scream that all the time outside of their Disney World Fantasy Place.) They left the store and were assaulted by Big Bird, who was not as big as the Hippo or the Giraffe. So they left Big Bird and the town of Pepperell and frolicked away in the fields near Griffin's house. 


The End.

I'm sick of people thinking that I don't care about certain things, or certain people. I'm tired of being told of what other people's problems are and how they are 40 times worse than mine. I probably will look back at this entry and think ""I should'nt have said that because I don't really mean it."" But right now, i feel like i do. People think that I don't have the same problems as they do. I have friends in the war, (and I don't mean Mike) family members that have died or done stupid things, people that I know and care about that are in the hospital with cancer, I have more shit going on than people think. And if they think the opposite, than I've got news for them... they're wrong. I experience the same things they do, I know what they're going through because I've been there. So the next time a person tells me, that I don't know what they're going through, or that they have much worse things to worry about... I'm gonna jump ship. Everybody experiences tragedies and all that other stuff, and everybody has different ways of dealing with it. Me, I don't run around like a chicken with it's head cut off or anything, I keep it all inside. I become very quiet and get this look on my face like I'm about to vomit. I sit there and say nothing to noone. Then, when I'm all by myself, I cry. That's my way of dealing with pain. And yes, I have pain to deal with. Don't tell me I'm wrong, and don't tell me your problems are more important than mine. Any problem is important. Got that? ANY problem!

~By the way, I'm not pissed off at any of my friends or family members. It's actually the news that got me frustrated. I don't  know how or why... but that is what set me off. So don't be offended by this and don't say ""I hate Sam Hough."" When I say that people don't know me and my problems... it's definetly people I don't know.

I'm angry.
Angry at a lot of things. But mostly, those dudes  who bombed London.
Why'd you have to do it? Are you satisfied? Did it make you feel better? Was it the revenge you wanted? What the hell were you thinking?  

If i had the chance I'd ask them those questions, amongst others...

Seriously though... I'd thought about joining the military and stuff, but nothing makes me more inspired to join then when someone does something like that. Not that I'm joing the military anytime soon, but it just sets something off inside of me. It makes me want to ""do my duty"". I know i'll never do that though. Not the whole physical or mental aspect, just because it wouldn't be what i truely wanted. it just makes me mad and want to do something about it. 

Like what do these dudes think they're going to do when they blow up everyone in the world? Look at each other and say ""Hm. Who's left? Noone? okay, that's how i wanted things."" Honestly. What the hell do they think that bombing innocent people is going to do? People are idiots. Myself included. What the fuck were those guys thinking??? I just don't know. i wish i did.


Hmm. (thinking)...................................................................................................................................................................................................Hey. If you want to come to my house for that movie thing, go for it. i need some company now and then. Right now though, i want to be left alone to think.

to think about everything. 

the war.
college.
majors.
minors.
music.
notes.
uniforms.
both for band and military.
people.
boys.
relationships.
me.
lonesome.
pathetic.
dreary.
more than what meets the eye.
me.

life.

Okay, so i wanted to have another party of some sort, but i didn't want it to be like the other ones. So i decided... what better way to spend your summer than to play baseball, football, soccer, or kickball with all your friends around? Right? So that's what I'm doing. 

On july 13th, next wednesday, you are invited to come and play with me. (Wow, that sounds weird.) but it's true. We'll have hotdogs and hamburgers and then we'll decide which game to play. If it's too damn hot or not enough people show up, than hey come anyway and we'll go for a dip in my pool. So bring your bathing suit too. And yes, it's gonna be wicked hott next week so i would suggest you do that!!! 

Ummm... what else???  Oh yes. The teams. If you recieved your invitation, you will notice you have been placed on a team. Either red or blue. Try to wear your team color when you get to my house. You don't have to, but it makes everything more fun. And the more you get into the spirit of things, the better. Seriously, if you feel like it, go ahead and dye your hair blue, or if you're not in the mood, just tie a bandana around your arm. 

If you can't make it, give me a call on my cell: 978- 50 - 2126. I need to know so that way we don't have 2 blues show up and 8 reds. Trust me, it'll be fun, but only if you make it fun!!! So hey, cancel your plans and get out of work. You deserve a day out with your buds! 

If you're still wicked confused... call me and i'll explain it in precise detail so that you get it. Alrighty!!! Hope you dudes can make it! And to anyone who did not recieve and invitation... the games start at 12:00 and end at 4:00. 

Oh, and hey, if you can't stay for the whole deal, no worries. come and go as you please, just let me know ahead of time!!!

I need to go out and do something that I could never ever experience ever again. Like steal a lawn ornament or something. (and yes, stealing a lawn ornament would be crazy for me.) I dunno, i want something different to happen. Something exciting, exotic, or rare. You know? I feel like this summer won't be incredibly ridiculous unless something like that happens. 

You know  I am so bored....     (""How bored are you?"")    ....I am so bored that I went out and bought hemp necklace making kits that are made for 10 year olds. And I didn't buy just one.. oh no. I bought like 6. So know I'm sitting at home, covered in hundreds of hemp necklaces. (each kit makes 10 necklaces)

You know the teenagers in all the high school movies? They're wild and crazy and don't give a shit. I want this summer to be like that. I just want to hang out with people and go to parties and just have fun. 

Next year we're gonna be seniors. I'm gonna have the best god damn senior year of my life!!!!!!! So why not start it off with one hell of a summer?


By the way... I'm starting to ressurrect my car and it's not working. Knowing my luck I won't have a car to drive in for the next 40 bazillion years!!!!! So remember, next time you say some prayers... mention ""The Dot"".  

Chow dudes!!!!!"

I will admmit I'm a sucker for summer romances. I think they're very romantic and cute. Hey, who the hell knows, maybe sumthin' will happen this year. If not though, I'm plenty happy with the people I've got. You know what else I love about summer? The way you can just wake up in the morning and say, hey, I think I'l do this today... and you do it. No contemplating, or planning, or organizing, just shear spontaniousness. (is that a word?) 

The one thing I really need to do is go to a drive in movie with some people. That is all I need to make my summer a totally and incredibly awesome one. So hey, if you have this same sudden urge to go to a drive in... call me and bring me in your trunk. It doesn't even matter if you know me, (which I hope you would considering your reading my livejournal) it doesn't matter if I hate you or you hate me, bring me along. Stuff me in the trunk or tie me to the hood, as long as I get to sit outside when its all dark and stare at that giant screen amongst the trees. Damn. Thats beautiful. (And if i just happen to have a hunka chunka sitting next to me, that'll be the cherry on my sundae.

Wow. Summer. Love. Joanne Wheeler. (I just read you journal which is why i'm thinking of you.) Ah.

I'm kinda bored right now, but i don't want to get off the computer and let my brother use it it so I'll attempt to write a poem and take up time. Here goes;

It will be titled ""friends""

Sitting behind you in math,
or next to you in the band room.
How about in front of you during the SATs
or beside you on the marching band bus. 
Lying on your bed, talking about boys,
or lounging on your couch watching X2.
Playing Rattlesnake booty and trying to slap in,
Pigging out on chips and seeing Tom Cruise dance in his underwear. 
Yes, these are the times I enjoy having and the places I love being.

But most of all it's the people I'm with. 
You guys make Chemistry actually interesting,
and math class tons o' fun.
You guys make relay for life that much better, 
and you guys make band camp entertaining. 

There are many reasons why I should be going to school,
my education, college, a job, my future,
but without my fellow dudes I wouldn't go at all.
It sounds really cheesy but I look forward to seeing you guys,
(even if you almost always find a way to poke fun at my ""untaintedness"") ~Mike and Tony
But really thanks for this year, for everything inbetween, because thats the way I live,
unscripted, unpredictable, and fricken awesome!

Ha Ha! That doesn't sound cheesy at all right?!
Love Ya'll! 
Chow!"

"event","It's now officially summer! (Going by my clock) It is soooo incredibly nice out today i can't help but be in a good mood. Today seemed like one of those ""movie summer days"". You know where the main character goes to the town field and watches a baseball game and then goes out and gets an ice cream and then eats dinner out on the porch and watch the sunset.... ya, that's what i did today and it felt amazing. If ever you are feeling bad, just act like a total hick and do something along those lines. 

(One time I was really bored so I went out into the horse field and created this lovely game i call Boomer Bowling with my horse. It's where you roll an apple on the ground as far as you can and you see if the horse will actually find it. You get points depending on how far the apple goes and if the horse eats it or not. Now don't tell me that's not hicksville 101!) 

Ha! Realy, sometimes being a country bumpkin is the best thing in the world. 

Aw dudes I went on this incredible website and found these two guitars that I love and will buy when I get the money! Ones an acustic and the other is like a ""rock 'n' roll"" type of guitar.... if you know what i mean.  Yay! I can't wait to be out on my own so then i can go ahead with my whole guitar plan thing.! 

Oh by the way... if i offended anyone with that last journal entry... i'm sorry. I just needed to vent out all my frustration and stuff... you know.

Going to get my nails done on monday = YAY!!!! I'm pumped! Maybe i'll get nice long ones and have the lady paint them hot pink with little bunnies on them, that'd be sooooo hott.

So I decided to go to college for secondary education / english. That way I can become an english teacher. I think that'd be pretty cool, but I'm still wondering if I'll be able to do it..... I'm sure it'll be fine.

Have you ever sat there and listened to your headphones and have the music match up perfectly with whats going on around you? Ilove those moments.

Hey... going for my permit on Thursday! Wish me luck!!!!!!!

That's all for now, chow!"

"event","Hey dudes!!!! Updating is fabulous. 

I'm tired of other people's shit.

Hatred. Fighting. Love. Death. Fear. Shyness. Boyfriends. Girlfriends. Tryouts. Breakups.. Etc..............

All of that crap. I'm done with for know. I feel like i'm all of a sudden a psychiatrist for everybody. I don't mind listening to my close friends' problems but it seems like everyone i know has been coming to me for advice. I know this should be taken as a good thing, but it's driving me crazy!

You know what, here's a little free therapy for you,,, if you're thinking about asking sam about something just remember her motto: ""suck it up and move on!"" 
 Now this does not apply to all situations; Mike, Joanne, Tiff, Me, Jeanna, Sara, Kim. 

But it is usually what i do for a lot of things. 

Okay here's some more free advice:

Love: Love will come everybodies way, it just takes some time and patience for some. (Look at me, 16, a junior in high school and never had a boyfriend... ever.) Don't spend your days worrying about how people consider you and if you are really in love with them, if you are and they are then something will happen naturally. 

Hatred: All I can say is that when you go through life you'll meet some people who are cool and others who suck. Don't worry about the ones who suck because you'll soon forget about them or you can at least deal with them for the time being.

Boyfriends/girlfriends: (See love) Plus, If you have a bf or gf thats cool. Congrats. If something is going wrong though, talk to them.

All the other crazy stuff: Its unimportant so if you really want to talk about it go see a fucking doctor or real therapistbecause i'm just 16 years old and experiencing the same things you are."

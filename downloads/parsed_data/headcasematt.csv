"event","its been cold lately, ive been wearing what i usually wear, jacket, jeans, old ass pumas, shirt under jacket...i look like a cartoon character...

people who are wearing scarves are dumb...there are people who live in this weather and wear SHORTS because they think its hot...i applaud them...the people who wear shorts in this weather obviously have a cold season that is a valid temperature to wear a scarf in...but here in texas....scarves are not necessary, seriously...the 60's isnt cold, hell the only reason you should even think about wearing a scarf is A.)it is a joke, or B.)its really freezing, as in under 32 degrees...| otherwise...leave the fucking scarf at home

anyway...we're supposed to be playing twice this weekend...if i was the betting type id put money on it we dont play at all...

....get this shit...some kid a few weeks ago comes up to me commenting on my minor threat patch and huge safety pin on my backpack saying i should join his 'punk' band...first of all...i love punk...dont get me wrong...but theres no fucking way in hell ill join his lame ass band...plus im busy with other things....second of all....he wanted it to sound nothing like punk....he wanted some pussy ass good charlotte bullshit...fuck that...third...this kid knew NOTHING about music...all he knows is what hes seen on shirts in hot topic...he thinks minor threat was like the casualties...obviously this kid doesnt listen to music...or if he does its all on the radio...so i said...no thanks...because i dont like to break it down in front of everyone...publicly...

anyway....ive concluded my thesis that the lady who is a student teacher for my u.s. history (round 2...failed it by one point last year)...is a fucking moron who cant teach for shit and looks like a crack addict that has was too much free time to put loads of makeup on...although it doesnt cover up the BLACK around her eyes from not sleeping...this bitch constantly has a stick shoved up her ass...today she yelled at matt (our drummer) for saying shut up...c'mon saying shut up is about as bad as breathing...its not....i cant wait till she goes back to her school...to learn how to not teach a class successfully even better...goddamn...

so anyway...first semester is pretty much 3/4ths over...pretty sweet...

ive become addicted to Trolli Brite Octopi, if you ever get a chance...try them out...they are some good gummy snacks...

i had some lame ass whiney line written here but i decided it was really stupid of me to say

i wish it was april...dont ask me why

lets see...oh..i got it...ill end with my music equipment want list:
new guitar not sure what
new cabinet
flight case for 5150II

rack noise gate
rack
rackmount for my wireless

-too much work
summerschool sucks
i want to buy too much stuff, but have no money for it...
actually its only 2 things...but its music equipment...and none of that is cheap
sonor force 3003 white sparkle drumset w/ gibraltar double pedal, ziljian a custom cymbals, genz benz el diablo 100w guitar amp with cabinet...although i could run it through my cabinet...and maybe an ibanez rg 7string guitar...
i would also like something no money can buy...but its too hard to find these days...and i have a feeling ill never find it...oh well...ill still look though...doesnt hurt to look....
i have severe writers block sorta...
drummers are hard to find...anyone know one that would want to play for us?....maybe?

im tired of people just saying shit because it will make others happy, you know what, its your fucking opinion, voice it, who gives a shit if other people like it, its a FUCKING OPINION

im sick of music trends, i like what i like, you like what you like, ill play what i want to play, not what everyone else plays, dont fucking copy me

ill admit...the headcase website looked like the eroica website...big fucking deal...i liked the design, but i tried pop-up windows and it didnt work...i shouldnt have made the background grey....

im really fucking worn out with so much right now, for one...myself...id like to be more ""social"" but if i try it turns stupid...ill stay more quiet...

ive been sick far too long

i need something new...or something inspirational, truely inspirational so i can get back to normal although if i got anything new it would be anything but normal...fuck it...

fuck john deere, whoever decided to put that logo on a fucking hat needs to be shot

fuck kids who THINK they are the shit, talk shit, and expect to NOT get hit....

the singer from coheed and cambria is secretly a girl, noone can look that hard and sing that high with a pair of testicles...sorry ladies

verizon wireless ampitheater blows

fuck primetime tv

last time i checked, fashion was/is pointless

who the fuck keeps jacking with the gas prices...

its needs to stop fucking raining already...or it just needs to rain a fuckload to the point that they cancel summerschool for a week...

the internet is the most dangerous place on earth...next to the middle of the ocean...or the sahara

im so sick of hearing about you(noone in particular) fucking someone how many ever times...while im doing my work in class...i dont want to hear it

i hate the lack of dedication...

ive come to find out, that reagan high school is rigged for the extra smart and rich kids...fuck everyone else right?

if the eraser fell off your pencil, youre fucked...dont bother me

something that annoys me about the so called rock star attitude: going on at an earlier time would piss of a person with this attitude going...such as 7:15....eventhough in our genre 7:15 is fucking late

i really dont like it when people fake sing to songs...thats really annoying...
i really dont like it when people ruin the mood of everything...

i think slayer should play at the white rabbit...so it will explode

people need to understand unearth is not a new band

the only reason anyone should go to ozzfest this year is to see, unearth, bleeding through, every time i die, hatebreed, judas priest, throwdown, and darkest hour...the rest of the bands sound the same

i am getting a sonor drumset soon

alrite i think im done for now...

i was invited to go play basketball tonite, but i cant ""because its too late""...im 17 fucking years old...my brother who is 13 stays out later than i do and he gets less shit for it...

oh how i love the promises my parents make right before summer starts but it takes almost nothing to make them forget it.....or go break it...im fucking sick of everything in this household, sure im lucky to be under a roof and eat when im hungry...but i think when someone tells someone something and intends for them to get excited about what someone said to them, you should go through and stay true to what you said to them...dont push it back in their face and take everything back just because one little thing that will never matter happened....

im wasting the best and worst years of my life in my fucking room in front of my fucking computer, and why...because im not allowed out to do anything at night...why, no reason at all

i agree this is a stupid post...but im fucking bored as hell...sitting in this boring fucking room waiting for nothing to happen per usual...excitement can be right around the corner...or could be thrown away....seems more times that not, its getting thrown away...

strength to rise is sounding pretty good, eventhough im worried about it because we have a hi-hat count before everything cuz someone cant make distinct drumrolls or fills

get a life sounds really good, everything is really tight and together, people like us who are dedicated to our music, with talent, can make good music quickly and make it sound good...and its a plus when noone is stubborn and is open minded to everything...its awesome

ive been kinda sick for the past 3 weeks...but its not really that bad cept for this terrible cough that wont go away...fucking sinuses or whatever i have

if anyone knows the headcase guestbook and reads it alot, someone posed as me trying to be all mean and shit, telling this person they are fucked up for saying that they heard justin was out of the band....first of all hes not out of the band....second of all i hate rumors that go around based on what idiots think they hear, third...people dont quite understand that i manage the guestbook and i could know exactly who they are by their ip address, and the person who posted posing as me must have either forgotten or didnt know how to block their ip address....so when i do some research on the post ill find out who it is...i hate when shit like that happends...

alrite well get a life has a show today, should be awesome

you walk around like your running this place, but theres a hundred kids who want to smash your fuckin, face, but ill be the first to grab you by the hair break your teeth and throw you, down the stairs

"event","Complete This Sentence
i am not: who you think i am or who you want me to be
i hurt: when it matters...seeing noone infront of me on the floor is NOT cool
i love: the feeling of playing a good show, throwing my guitar around my shoulder, looking out and seeing people dancing to my songs, being who i am, friends...and even distant and hard to reach peoples presence....
i hate: drama, and people who like to start it. i also hate no crowd movement AND when someone clearly fucks up
i fear: losing my true self
i hope: to make it in the hxc scene and make an impact and get outta here
i hear: the same old shit over and over and over and over...
i crave: a serious relationship with someone who is down for it just as much as i am
i regret: not much....probably my education as of late...but i believe im above the useless knowledge they try to feed me...
i cry: i havent cried for many many many years
i care: about all my friends, my family, and anyone who deserves it
i always: thankful for everything i have, and truthful
i long to: see barbie again (dont go thinking obsession either)
i feel alone: when im driving by myself, when im thinking to myself, when im bymyself
i listen: to everything but words dont mean shit without actions
i hide: my true feelings alot
i drive: any fucking place i feel like...its my gas...ill use it to my liking
i sing: when i have to, have to is not when someone asks ""your in a band sing me a song""...that has to be the most stupid and ignorant question/statement ive ever heard from someone who claims they are into music
i dance: at hardcore shows
i write: all the time, any spark of inspiration i have is always documented
i breathe: out of my lungs
i play: guitar, drums, diaphragm
i miss: i dont have to answer this..., and some of my old friends
i search: for the best sound every day
i learn: more in my mind than from a teacher
i feel: annoyed by shady people who cant plan for shit...several people know what im talking about, everyone else is probably thinking...what?
i know: next time i turn my car on no hope in texas will be playing
i say: /speak the the truth
i succeed: when dedicated
i fail: when i feel that it isnt important or in my best interest
i dream: of things i wish i had
i sleep: when i can...fuck you mrs degrove
i wonder: if this whole thing we call life is really real or just some grand scheme to make you think you are important
i want: to play more shows around town, make the fanbase grow, record again
i worry: about more than i should
i have: my band, equipment, friends, car, computer, brain
i give: my all towards what is important to me
i fight: if it comes down to it
i wait: too long for things to happen...although i call that 'patients'
i need: to get out of school already
i am: myself and noone else
i think: that people who dont know what they are talking about need to shut the fuck up
i can't help the fact that: i am the way i am, if i wasnt it wouldnt be me
i stay: true till death

"event","i cant get her off my mind...so heres the whole story behind it<br>
<br>
<lj-cut>
i remember all of this like it was yesterday...so if youre wondering
that...yes i remember very well
last march....around this time i was still in guitar lessons(still am
for theory and reading) and i happened to go into century music with my
guitar and i sat down and just played it waiting for my lesson...well
this gorgeous girl walks in...with her friend who was there to take
bass lessons...and when i say gorgeous i mean seriously gorgeous....she
was looking at a fender guitar with silver glitter sparkles stuff on
it...it wasnt a bad guitar....but anyway...she sat down on some amps
looking around the store...this time ill take to describe her....short
brown kinda punkish hair, black hoodie with a casualties patch on the
back jeans chucks, brown eyes, beautiful face, nice
smile...anyway...this other guy comes in and by this time i had plugged
into an amp and i was playing a converge song i believe...and she asked
me if i was in a band and i said yea 2 actually one is punk and one is
hardcore metal...she replied thats kool im kinda in a band but the
other members arent as dedicated as me...and i said yea i know how that
is...then the other guy kinda interrupted and was like...dude check it
out i learned that drowning pool song...and he played it...me and her
both watched...we were kinda far apart from each other...we both looked
at each other and looked away and whatnot...she smiled i smiled...it
was a kool moment.....anyway she asked if i liked street punk and i
said yea its pretty kool and i said you like the casualties right? and
she said yea they are awesome so i played 30 seconds or so of their
song nightmare she was like...oh man thats so awesome i wish i could
play that...i said...well i can teach it to you....are you going to be
in here on wednesdays?...she said yea im probably going to be coming
with my friend to her bass lessons...and then my teacher was like...hey
matt ready...so i had to leave....i was walking to the room and i
turned around and asked....whats your
name?....barbie....yours?...matt...nice meeting you....i noticed she
was smiling alot....anyway...the next week i went in and she was there
and before anything i asked for her screen name....converseandstuds but
ill probably change it tonite to faithinchaos....ive only talked to her
twice online...she never changed her sn....anyway....i tried teaching
her nightmare and she was like...umm...i dont know chords very
well...come behind me and show me...so i got up and assisted her...she
kinda learned the song a little better but still didnt understand it
very well...although she was doing good for the first time playing
it....i had to take my lessons early that day...so i said ill talk to
her later....she smiled....the next week it was about mid april...she
was there with a few friends and i sat down and she came over and was
like hey whats up....i said nothing really hows it going?...good, nice
to see you.....i said...nice to see you too with a smile....i had to
take my lessons early again so i said well i have to go...sorry i
couldnt teach you much more...she said it was kool and waived
bye....the next week...i went in but my teacher wasnt there so we just
talked didnt even think about learning nightmare...she said she had put
the silver guitar on layaway and was getting it soon....but it was
kinda held back because she had broken her thumb in a youth brigade
pit...we talked about shows we had been to...and before i knew it she
had to leave....we said bye and she left...i looked at amps the rest of
the time i was there....the next week...it was mid may nearing the end
of school...i was walking to the door and she was walking out i was
carrying my jackson with me and i told her id show it to her when i had
it...she loved it...but she had to leave...so we said bye...i went in
and looked at amps and got my guitar re-strung...the next week it was
the end of may and school was over in a few days....she was also
leaving somewhere so we just said hey and bye realy quick...and yea...i
went and took my lessons........and that was the last time i saw
her......i never stopped thinking about her during the whole summer...i
know there was a few girls who liked me over the summer....but i
realllly like/liked barbie and i missed her more than you could
imagine......but i never got to see her...and i kept telling
myself...next time i see her...im going to ask her out...im going to do
it....the next time i saw her was the friday before labor day weekend
at red reverse's first show back...i didnt talk to her at all....i was
paralyzed by the shock of seeing her there....and she walked right past
me....i dont know what i was thinking....i havent seen her since....i
still miss her alot...and id like to see her again....but i doubt it
will happen....i can hope for it though....until the day i see her
again...i will miss her....<lj-cut><br>
<br>
id pick her over anyone though....sorry anyone who that offends or gets to in a bad way...but i would....<br>

spring break is this week...im getting insurance tomorrow and ill be driving!! FUCKING FINALLY!!

over spring break id like to find a new band name...i think we're going to remain as headcase until the uriel cd release party at the white rabbit in june....BUT...when we play other places we will be known as the new name...just because it would be less confusing that way...

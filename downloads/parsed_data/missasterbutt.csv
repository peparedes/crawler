Anyway, that freak just came in my office and in ear shot of my fellow co-workers said, ""You need to go on a low cholesterol diet and I will get you a copy of it.""  DUH DUH DUH

First of all, do skinny people think that fat people are fat because we don't know the healthy way to eat?  It may be that way for some, but I know how to eat.  I just don't do it all the time.  I eat for comfort.  I mean crap, this has been a hard year for me.  My Mommy died.  Plus, I quit smoking in May of 2000.  I think I have made good changes for my health. I wonder what her excuse is (the nurse is overweight herself and she smokes.)  Secondly, do I look like a moron to you?  

SHE NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE.   She should fear Kinggrady.  He will flat put the smack down on a nurse who bugs his little sis.  SO Back off you Winch!

It is their money to spend as they please. (Is this still America?)Don't complain when you think it is not fair that the players make too much money when you pay their salary.

My boss is going to Texas to visit his family in a few weeks.  Another co-worker of ours will be in Vegas at the same time.  She said, ""Why don't you just pick me up on your way back from Dallas?""
He said, ""Well, that will be a little out of my way.""  Then she proceeds to tell him that Las Vegas is on the way to Dallas.  THE STUPIDITY ASTOUNDS ME!  I then proceeded to give her a little Geography lesson.  This person is actually the head of a Department. When I worked at Tape Craft, there was moron there who told me that Mexico was not in North America, it is is Latin America.  HELLO!!!!  She also told me that a Phone Call to Canada is not a international call because it is ""attached"" to America.  Those are her words, not mine. 

Let me tell you about another Retard I work with.  She told me the word ""Kosher"" meant Dill ( as in the spice ) And we wonder why our society is falling apart.  What can I say.

Ok.  I have been picking on the women.  Let me tell you a Stupid man story.  This story relates to my former boss.  I can't remember what got us on the subject, but he wanted to know where Puerto Rico was.  He had a map in his office, so I walked over and pointed out it's location.  I guess I must of had that look on my face.  You know the one that says, (you are a retard, you are a retard).  He then says, ""I am not all that good at history.""  I almost passed out.  My head was spinning.  Did he actually just say that?  Could he truly be that stupid and hold a college degree?  Sadly, the answer was yes.  I couldn't let it go.  I should have, but I just couldn't.  ITS NOT HISTORY, ITS GEOGRAPHY.

In the first few moments, It literally felt as if I had been kicked in the stomach and my wind knocked completely out of me.  How did I survive?  Could it really have been a whole year since I talked to her, since I told her about my day?  Has it been that long since I have been loved like only a mother can?

I know this b/c I started wearing a heart rate monitor after my Mom died last year of a heart attack.  Anyway, it was not really a big deal, but I thought my blood pressure might be up.

So, today at work, I have the nurse check my blood pressure.  It was 122/82.  That's pretty good.  I was telling her what had happened the previous day.  She said She wanted the borrow my FIRM tapes and blah blah blah.  Then, she has the gall to say, ""If you exercise, why don't you loose weight?""  I may not have taken offense except she is at least as big as I am.  I was shocked and didn't know what to say.  I said, "" Cause I eat too much"".  Then she proceeds to tell me that I need to watch my diet. NO DUH!!!!!

This is coming from a nurse who is also large quite.  Don't you think she would be a little more sensitive because she is in the same position all over weight people are.  She has lost 50 lbs on the Atkins Diet (SHe is still bigger than me!) and suggested I do the same.  Yes, I know that the diet works and scores of people have lost tons of weight on it?  But is it healthy?  Even if it is healthy, I don't think I can forgo all carbs.

So Nurse, KISS MY BIG FAT DIMPLED BUTT!"

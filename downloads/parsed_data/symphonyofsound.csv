EVERYONE must go to a lake. A nice big one. Or the ocean I suppose. Huge expanses of water make me OH so HAPPY. Wish you all could be here though. This kind of scenery makes me feel artistic and brings on thought-provoking conversations and revelations and such. Mostly I think I am just making this up as I go along. But it feels good. I have been swimming 3 to 4 times a day for HOURS upon HOURS. The water here is terrific. Cept' when you swallow it in large gulps. 

I miss you all."

"event","My father is firmly of the oppinion that ignorance is NOT bliss. And DAMN, it would be nice to have such a noble philosophy. Sometimes I would just rather not know. But does that somehow make things easier? Maybe it just means that you will live a relatively predictable and not so disturbing life until those things that you refused to accept and understand come back with vengence. So would you rather take the medicine in small doses, or all AT ONCE? What will be your choice unravelling? 

Shut up elsa.

I have a distinctly numb feeling in my leg right now. I am restless. Anticipating. Random things like the number of dogs in China and the time it takes to cook a pig might be circulating in my brain. I might ask you: did you fold any socks today? How about towels? Is there any room left in you heart for Ben and Jerry? Where do you plan on being at 4:37 this afternoon? It is likely that the hole in your head is a kind of separation anxiety. Who says that pink is the new black. What does that mean anyway? I am going with green, just to be sure.

On the shelves of broken hearts and minds unfolding
Tangible grow the spaces between

Two eyes wide open save a moment
While parallel, the others follow gravity

To stand out

To test the edge and then fall so recklessly

Your heart doesnt know how to love anymore

Lost in bitter waters

You don't know what it's like to let go
Have you ever slept in fields without worrying about
The grass stains

It's a balancing act in oceans of sand
Falling quickly 
Singing softly
A hopeless reckoning war with the wire

Someday you'll wake up and realize that it all passed you by
You spent too long deciding
Afraid of taking risks
afraid of being vulnerable

But maybe, just maybe you cross that line and you'll find

So I am sitting here in this familiar cream-colored box of a building with beastly white lights and a drone of click click clicking and shhhh-ing and -""excuse me, that would be one person at a computer,one person at a computer. NO, I am not dyslexic, I am simply quite fond of repeating myself until you make your way properly, directly, in a straight, unimaginative line out our door. And please, do not jump over the red-light-beeper, we like to COUNT how many delinquents we kick out the doors. This is MINE I tell you...ALL MINE."" I swear these people are Nazis. 

I feel very small here. Very lost. Very insane. I half expect the walls to be padded. 

So it is drisly outside. But nice...a cool fresh interlude. A pleasant intermission in this sweltering hotness. Perhaps I will run. Unless...no, my legs are still painfully reminded of sunday. I don't exactly know what got in to me. I had some complete breakdown, and I was suddenly incredibly angry with myself. I needed to do something. Be something else. So I went exploring in my woods. I took a three hour nap. I blew off my homework. I ran. I walked I sang. I cried. I played piano for the first time in months.(aghhhh that was bad). I decided that Mom is going to teach me how to play guitar. I took a blanket out into our field and lay down in the grass for an hour. I ate dessert for lunch. SO HA. HAHAHAHAHA I SAY. I want to live. I don't want to waste my life away -something that I too often feel is the case. School, mostly is the thing that brings me down. I feel so confined there. I love my friends, even like some of my teachers...but I don't feel inspired often enough. I dwell to much on missing people...well, Collin -and my sister...Peter, my brother of sorts. I want to be a person who I would want to be around if I were someone else. So here goes. TO LIVING SOMETHING REAL.

I know that there are a million things that I should be doing with my life, and that i WAN'T to do, but I can't seem to focus. I am so happy for him to have this experience - indeed it is the chance of a lifetime. But i can't help wanting him to be here at the same time. I know that I need to stand on my own, and in the long run this whole thing will make me a stronger (better? im not sure) person. i just wish i had someone to catch me on the bad days. I appreciate all you wonderful people who try to do this for me...but im afraid there is a spot that can't be filled at the moment. This is only a piece of the whole thing - but a rather big one at the moment. I wish that i could just put it in storage until june.

It is impossible to paint accurately with the stupid metal thingies. Oh well. We are all in it together i guess. except for amanda of course - she seems to know exactly what she is doing, so we all ask her for advice like she is the teacher. yay. its funny kind of. I like the idea that there are no ""right"" colors that we should be seeing...that its your own interpretation. This way i will have a retort when mrs. Lorentzen tells my that i have all my colors wrong. So yeah. Sorry for the inconsequential rambling.

so i got a very unsuspected phone call the other night from sir collin. i shrieked. Then dad jumped and screamed - ""did you win???"" ""win what???!!"" i yelled back. it was all rather silly. i spent about the first 15 minutes in shock for the fact that i was speaking to him. its kinda trippy - that whole thing about New Zealand being in the future...makes my mind hurt.

CANT BELIEVE THAT BOTH MY SPEECH THINGS ARE GOING TO ALL STATE!!!! im very excited, and at the same time disappointed that we must continue practicing. im pretty sure the excitement outweighs the other stuff though. :)

The eighteenth<br>century British portrait painters would have<br>been attracted by your brilliant complexion and<br>your classical features. Sir Joshua Reynolds<br>loved to paint girls like you in white dresses<br>with blue satin sashes. Reynolds and other<br>portrait painters of his time also portrayed<br>blue eyed, dark-haired girls, and golden-haired<br>ones too, plus the occasional red-head. The<br>following painters would have painted you; Sir<br>Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence.

"event","I have a backache. I'm not so sure I spelled that right, but oh well. I doubt anyone reads this anyway...
 Right now i should be studying for my spanish and vocab quizzes, but i am entirely unmotivated. Its wonderful when you get to that point of no longer REALLY caring. I have so much to do, but its all to easy not to think about it!!! 
Note to self: I enjoy badminton. Funny, because I could not be worse at it, but I am not dreading P.E. quite as much lately. Granted, this is hardly a work out - but i think that is why i like it. not that anyone is really interested, but yeah.

I Really hate it when people have superiority complexes. I am trying to tell myself that this will not happen when i become an upper classman - but perhaps there is something that im missing...maybe you just get to your junior/senior year, and suddenly everyone and everything is annoying, and how could anyone understand because they are all stupid, naive freshmen. Right? maybe this is uncontrollable. I hope not.Im not attacking anyone in particular here, because, of course, I know some fabulous upper classmen. Im just sick of people putting so much stock in AGE. ITS A NUMBER! im sure we all know that some ten year-olds are mature enough to be twenty, and there are twenty year-olds who are stick firmly stuck in there 3rd grade trousers."

"event","ok...so speech went well i guess! We got a one in readers theater (yea!)AND choral reading. Never would have guessed about the latter. Actually i was rather disappointed. I am SICK OF PRACTICING! oh well. will be over soon i guess. 

I have noticed that I forgive people very easily. It is hard for me to stay angry. Darn it! AHHH! This may be a bad thing, i dont know for sure. 
I feel woozy, and i think im getting sick, but perhaps thats because i have been staring and the stupid computer for hours trying to time my ""Who am I"" paper (for the second time - yea for me, it all disappeared from my disk!) Im not sure sure who i am anymore. it all gets lost in the the crappy guidelines. I really cant write this way!!! 
I miss having noodles at Sam's house. The fact that i dont know where her house is makes things even more difficult. I want it to be summer...I feel like everyone is drifting apart - maybe this is natural, but ahhggg! Doesnt seem like our friends do anything anymore. Maybe its just that the last time we all really did was at Collin and Annee's going away ""party."" perhaps the sobering reason for the gathering explained our inability to interact. We just watched movies - always the easy solution. HA. It feels like we (I?) have forgotten how to live. Feeling like a robot. grrr
Dont get me wrong. I'm not depressed. I'm too busy to be depressed. It will all soak in eventually, but im not going to rush things.
 and im off like a prom dress (Yea Jazzy!)-elsa"

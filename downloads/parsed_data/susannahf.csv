It's a Dell running Win XP (SP3), and has an Nvidia GeForce 8300 GS graphics card.&nbsp; I *think* the card is broken.&nbsp; For the last few weeks, every time it runs, either lots of green/magenta dots appear on the screen, or it blue screens.&nbsp; When it blue screens, the error refers to nvidia driver files.&nbsp; I've installed the most recent driver, and even uninstalled all the graphics drivers, to no effect.&nbsp; Hence my theory that this is a hardware problem.&nbsp; The question is, is it the graphics card?
It's not the monitor - that works fine on other machines.&nbsp; But could it be something else, such as the motherboard?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've reached the end of my experience.

Any ideas?"

"event","A more cheerful post after the ones of late.<br />I'm a member of St John Ambulance in Oxford - it's my main &quot;hobby&quot;, and I thoroughly enjoy it. &nbsp;At the moment, they're running a big drive called &quot;The Difference&quot; - it's part fundraising, part awareness-raising, and part encouraging people to learn first aid, so that they could be &quot;the difference&quot; between life and death for someone.<br />As part of this, St John Oxfordshire has been chosen as BBC Oxford's charity during their 40th birthday celebrations. &nbsp;They're hoping to raise at least &pound;60,000 to pay for a new 4x4 ambulance. &nbsp;As part of this, we are going to attempt to break the world record for the largest first aid training session. &nbsp;If you're near Oxford on 4th December, and fancy joining in please<a href=""http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/counties/oxfordshire/bbc-partnership/world-record.aspx""> sign up</a> - you only have to raise a tenner, and you'll be taught basic first aid and get a certificate and a first aid booklet to take home.<br /><br />As my divisional officer is also one of the county officers for training, she had the joy of teaching BBC Radio Oxford's breakfast show presenter CPR this morning, live on air. &nbsp;It's up on the iplayer for the next 7 days, so have a listen - the sound effects are great, particularly him singing &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot;:<br /><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00bz85p/Malcolm_Boyden_11_11_2010/"">iPlayer - 1 hour and 6 minutes in</a>"

For the benefit of new Members of the House, I should say that my noble friend Lady Wilkins will assist me when I run out of breath, as agreed by the usual channels.<br /><br />1 Nov 2010 : Column 1467<br /><br />There is so much to debate, so I have decided to speak to one area only: where disabled people are being asked to pay a price that far outstrips the potential saving to the Exchequer. I know that my noble friend Lord Low will later cover other new financial policies that will affect for good or bad the lives of disabled people. Let me be clear from the outset that I do not deny the need to address the deficit in part through cuts in public spending. It is in everyone's interests, including society's poorest and most disabled, that the books balance. However, to face reality, we must understand reality. Doing so requires us to recognise the full implications of cuts to people in their everyday lives. Only then can we make sensible choices, not just for the individuals who are directly affected but in the public interest.<br /><br />That is why I have decided to concentrate today on what some may think is a small and insignificant cut to independent living services for disabled people but which has the most disproportionately devastating consequences for their lives. First, before I say what it is, I declare an interest as someone who receives public care and support services targeted by the CSR. I am also a trustee of the National Centre for Independent Living and chair of the Government's Right to Control advisory group. In fact, I often give expert advice to the Minister on disability matters.<br /><br />A Government proposal under the heading &quot;Welfare Reform&quot; is to,<br /><br />&quot;remove the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance for people in residential care, where such costs are&quot;-<br />supposedly-<br /><br />&quot;already met from public funds, saving &pound;135 million by 2014-15&quot;.<br />To claim DLA, you must be under 65 at the time of the claim. The Government estimate that this cut will affect 58,000 disabled young people and working-age adults.<br /><br />This proposal is seriously flawed for four reasons. First, it will have negative and costly effects on disabled people's health and well-being, their ability to develop social and community networks and their capacity to move on from residential care to be, as the Government want, independent, participating citizens, not dependants. Secondly, it conflicts with the Government's policies for personalisation, independent living and encouraging disabled people to gain or retain employment. Thirdly, it is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose of modern residential care and the potential of disabled people living there. Fourthly, it is incompatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<br /><br />I am sure we all agree that people living in care homes today are full citizens. We should therefore expect and want them to exercise their human and civil rights and to contribute to civil society like everyone else. Residential care homes are no longer, or should not be, places to hide people away in or to deny them opportunities the rest of us take for granted: independence, choice, access to public life and maybe, for those who can, eventually the possibility of work and independence. Residential care homes are not intended to be prisons. We all enjoy activities outside our homes. It should be no different for those living in residential care homes.<br /><br />1 Nov 2010 : Column 1468<br /><br />At this point, Baroness Wilkins continued the speech for Baroness Campbell of Surbiton.<br /><br />Since the CSR announcement on this DLA saving, disability organisations have been receiving alarmed calls from people desperate at the prospect of losing this entitlement to hard-won independence. Last week RADAR heard from Patricia King. Her son and daughter-in-law are both disabled and live in residential care. Without the mobility component, they will no longer be able to visit the doctor, dentist, bank, church, library or shops, let alone relatives and friends. The proposed changes will remove over 45 per cent of her son's total allowances and over 69 per cent of his wife's. Neither the local authority nor the care home is in a financial position to offer free transport as part of its service to the residents. Patricia King, rightly in my view, calls this a cruel cut. She says:<br /><br />&quot;Some politicians are accepting a 5% cut, but would they accept a 45% or 69% cut to the money that buys them their personal freedoms?&quot;.<br /><br />The DWP argues that the measure would bring care-home residents into line with hospital in-patients, who lose access to the benefit on the same basis. However, the comparison is false. People of working age living in care homes are not in the same position as patients in hospital. In hospital, you are sick and therefore do not need an allowance to go out. Residential care is disabled people's home and the base from which they go out to engage in education, training, work, leisure, travel, family and social contact. For many, it is a stepping stone to living independently in the community. Noble Lords may know that care-home residents must surrender almost all their income to support the cost of their care. They are allowed to retain only about &pound;22 a week for personal expenses, so a basic mobility scooter-a mobility aid often bought with DLA finance-costing about &pound;1,500 is out of reach without the DLA mobility component of &pound;49.85 a week. Removing that component takes away over two-thirds of the care-home resident's income. It makes Britain's most severely disabled people the group who lose most from the CSR; it literally removes their mobility.<br /><br />At this point, Baroness Campbell of Surbiton resumed.<br /><br />Could this House consider, even for a moment, denying me my electric wheelchair or the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, his scooter? I am sure noble Lords would be outraged and would defend our right to contribute to the work of the House. I do not accept that the national finances are such that we should now deny people living in care homes the same rights. To be clear, the DLA mobility component helps residents to maintain contact with families and friends, access the big society as a volunteer, participate in leisure and fitness activities and be active members of their local community. Such activities promote physical and mental well-being. They help to sustain one's sense of identity and prevent the loss of confidence and the low morale often associated with depression. The proposed modest savings in DLA are likely to be outweighed by increased demands on the NHS and the costs linked to preventing severely disabled people joining society. It makes neither moral nor financial sense.<br /><br />1 Nov 2010 : Column 1469<br /><br />I am deeply concerned that this cut in spending was not subject to a disability, equality and human rights impact assessment, that it was not discussed with those of us who have had years of experience of advising Governments on disability matters, and that the Treasury failed to run it by its own expert department, the Office for Disability Issues, which found out about the policy on the morning of the CSR announcement. I hope the Minister will explain that to me.<br /><br />The big fair society can be achieved only if support structures are there to enable disabled people to play their part. Otherwise, we will go back to a time when most disabled people were caught in a culture of dependency with no alternative but to beg for charity or to be jolly grateful for what they got. This fills me with dread. I am sorry that if this debate continues beyond 10 o'clock, I will not be here or, if I am, I will be bedding down on the Back Bench. I have to be home as my CSR-dependent support service dictates my moves. Please think again on this very small cut that illustrates where we are heading.</div></lj-cut><div style=""margin-left: 40px; "">&nbsp;</div><br />There is support out there, but the government is still not listening.<br /><br />ETA: by the way, the minister is just plain <strong>wrong</strong>. &nbsp;There is no &quot;overlap of public funds&quot; that I've ever seen. &nbsp;If my brother's funding really is meant to cover his mobility needs, then it has either been mis-assessed (e.g. by saying &quot;well, you have a vehicle/higher rate mobility, so you don't need that money&quot;), or it is so woefully inadequate in other areas that his mobility funding is being used for something frivolous, like nurses, or keeping his house clean enough that he won't get some horrible (and potentially fatal) infection. &nbsp;Certainly there is no magic pot of money that isn't being used.<br />I have emailed the Baroness to tell her what a wonderful speech she made. &nbsp;I have also emailed the minister to point out the inaccuracies in her response. &nbsp;I would be surprised if she even reads my email, and I doubt she will pay any attention, but at least I have<em> </em>tried."

I presented some work which I hope will be published in a good journal (the Lancet is our first choice) soon.
We had a very interesting conversation.&nbsp; 

At the end, she asked me what my specialism was.&nbsp; Was I&nbsp;a paediatrician?&nbsp; An ED doctor? 
Um, no, I'm an engineer.&nbsp; A very very flattered engineer.

"event","&nbsp;I have spent an inordinate amount of time over the last week on the phone to the council. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because I would rather like to exercise my democratic right to make an informed choice when I&nbsp;vote in the upcoming General Election. &nbsp;And I didn't have a polling card when they had clearly been delivered elsewhere. &nbsp;And last time I lived in this building and there was an election, guess what? &nbsp;I didn't get a polling card.<br /><br />&quot;So what?&quot; I hear the more informed among you cry. &nbsp;&quot;You don't need a polling card to vote.&quot; &nbsp;<br />You are of course perfectly correct. &nbsp;However, it is somewhat tricky to vote if a) you don't know what constituency you are in (and hence who the candidates are), and b) you don't know where the polling booth is. &nbsp;<br />&quot;Ah, but surely these things can be ascertained via careful questioning of neighbours, or some cunning internet searching?&quot;<br />Again, theoretically, you are correct. &nbsp;However, my cunning internet searching merely revealed that my building is very close to the constituency boundary, and that that boundary has/is being/will be changed. &nbsp;Take your pick. &nbsp;I'm fairly sure that the boundary for this election is not the same as the one for the last election, and it may be lined up for another change before the next one. &nbsp;Anyhoo, depending on where I searched, and which boundary I looked at, I could be in Oxford East (Labour extremely marginal, 4th Lib Dem target seat), or Oxford West and Abingdon (Lib Dem pretty darn safe). &nbsp;Hence the phone calls to the council.<br />I chose to phone Oxford City Council, as they are *my* council, even though they are only responsible for the Oxford East election (Oxford West and Abingdon comes under Vale of the White Horse, which is a much more excitingly named council, but might get confused if a person living in what is fundamentally central Oxford phoned them up).<br /><br />Phone call number 1 (late last week or possibly early this week): <br />Me: &quot;I don't have a polling card, and I didn't get one last election.&quot;<br />Lady: &quot;Oh, well, they will be sent out in the next couple of weeks. &nbsp;Anyway, you can vote without a polling card, so don't worry&quot;<br />Me: (thinks, aren't you even worried about the loss of polling cards?) &nbsp;&quot;Um, yes I know that, but I'd like to know what constituency I'm in&quot;<br />Lady: &quot;It'll be on your polling card&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Yes, but I <em>didn't get one last time</em>. &nbsp;So I probably won't get one this time. &nbsp;I live is student halls and we don't have the ability to receive post. &nbsp;So could you maybe look it up for me?&quot;<br />Lady: &quot;Oh. &nbsp;OK.&quot; &nbsp;&lt;looks me up on the electoral roll&gt; &nbsp;&quot;I wonder what that means?&quot; &nbsp;&lt;lady goes to check strange code with cow-orker&gt; &quot;Oxford West and Abingdon&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Thanks. &nbsp;It would be nice if you could fix the polling card thing though.&quot;<br />Lady: &quot;I'll talk to the people in charge and make sure something is sorted out.&quot;<br /><br />No progress occurs. &nbsp;No polling card arrives. &nbsp;I realise that I will also need to know where the polling station is. &nbsp;I ring back (yesterday).<br />Me: &quot;Hi, I don't have a polling card, and I'd like to know where my polling station will be&quot;<br />Lady (maybe the same one, not sure): &quot;You don't need a polling card to vote, you know&quot;<br />Me: &quot;Yes, I know. &nbsp;But I do need to know where the polling station is.&quot;<br />&lt;we go through the same rigmarole of me explaining about no polling cards and her promising to &quot;do something&quot;, and also to ring me back with information about what they will do. &nbsp;In the meantime...&gt;<br />Lady: &quot;You're in Oxford West and Abingdon constituency and your polling station is the Wesley Memorial Church&quot;<br /><br />Now, I should have queried that. &nbsp;You see, I knew (from sneaking a peek at a polling card in the pigeon holes in college) that Wes Mem is the polling station for Oxford East. &nbsp;So either it was the wrong polling station, or the wrong constituency.<br />She didn't ring back, but today I spotted that there were polling cards in the open post boxes in the stairwell. &nbsp;I suspect they will stay there - basically nothing gets posted into them except flyers, so I may do a public service and distribute them if they're still there the weekend before the election. &nbsp;Still, it's progress, and I have a polling card.<br />Which confirms that my constituency is actually Oxford East, and not the constituency I was told on two separate occasions.<br />Sigh.<br /><br />She did get the polling station right at least..."

"event","You know how sometimes you want to write down a plan, but don't know where to start?&nbsp; 
Way back when, I went on a project management course, and one of the best things I learned was using postit notes to plan something.
You can start anywhere you like, write a task, or a sub-project or a section of the paper, or whatever it is that you are breaking your project up into, and put it on a postit note.&nbsp; And stick it somewhere.&nbsp; Then write another, and stick it somewhere sensible in relation to the first.&nbsp; 
When you suddenly realise you want to reorganise it, you can - it's only postit notes.&nbsp; You can even tear them in half if necessary (and stick blutac on the back of the half without any sticky if you need to).
I really love this method.&nbsp; Somehow, having the freedom of knowing that I *can* rearrange the notes means that I get it 90% right first time.&nbsp; If I tried to write it on a sheet of paper though, I'd end up starting at a blank space for ages, worried that I'd start in the wrong place.

Of course, recording it is another issue..."

"event","Oh. &nbsp;My. &nbsp;Word. &nbsp;I think I may have just died and gone to heaven.

I have just been to dinner at <a href=""http://www.michaelskitchen.co.uk/"">Michael's Kitchen</a>, as an old friend from high school was visiting, and it came highly recommended from people in my lab. &nbsp;Now, I knew that the chef is meant to have a Michelin star, and that the food was meant to be good, but I wasn't expecting anything like what we got.

For a start, it was deserted. &nbsp;I really mean deserted. &nbsp;We were the only diners there for the first half hour, and even by the time we left, there were only two other tables of diners. &nbsp;I know that it's not been open long, but this surprised me. &nbsp;Somehow, I don't think it'll last. &nbsp;

The cuisine is &quot;International and royal Thai&quot;, and there was certainly a thai element to most of the dishes we had. &nbsp;We ordered mains and starters, but were presented with what I believe is called an &quot;amuse bouche&quot; while we were waiting for the starter. &nbsp;If I remember correctly, this was described as a &quot;Carrot and Ginger Cappucino&quot;, and was a tiny shot of hot frothy liquid somewhere between a drink and a soup. &nbsp;It was absolutely heavenly, with just the right balance of ginger. &nbsp;It was at this point that we realised that this was to be no ordinary meal.

The starters arrived a little later - I had ordered rice paper rolls with soft shell crab and sweet chilli dipping sauce. &nbsp;From the description, I was vaguely expecting spring rolls. &nbsp;Oh no. &nbsp;What I got was four beautifully presented rolls looking more like super-sized sushi maki rolls, except with rice noodles rather than rice, and rice paper rather than seaweed on the inside. &nbsp;I didn't identify all of the ingredients, but apart from the crab, there was definitely carrot (in tiny perfect juliennes), slices of mango, pickled ginger, lettuce, and what I think may have been radish. &nbsp;And it all went perfectly together. &nbsp;My companions had a beautifully deep, rich chestnut and truffle soup, and a &quot;seafood udon cocktail&quot;, served in a tall glass so that the udon noodles could be seen floating through the clear broth.

The main courses were no less impressive. &nbsp;Both Hannah and I ordered the roast duck and lychee curry with lotus leaf rice. &nbsp;This turned out to be a very well flavoured thai red curry (made to order I assume as we were asked how spicy we would prefer it, much in the way that you are usually asked how well done you like your steak). &nbsp;The rice was the real star of the show though - it had been wrapped around some... stuff (we weren't quite sure what - Hannah thought meat, I thought maybe lotus bits, both of us identified mushroom), then wrapped in a lotus leaf and baked, making it sticky and incredibly tasty. &nbsp;I forget the exact title of Mo's dish - it had boar and sausage in and an orange sauce and was very meaty and gamey when I tasted it - very solid earthy food.

Under ordinary circumstances, we would have stopped here. &nbsp;We were really quite full. &nbsp;However, the quality of the food, and the imagination and presentation meant that we couldn't bear not to have dessert. &nbsp;Two baked cheesecakes and a warm chocolate cake were duly ordered. &nbsp;We were not disappointed. &nbsp;The cheesecakes were soft, moist and delicately ffavoured, with a tart berry sauce. &nbsp;The chocolate cake was hot, rich, and wallowing in quarter of an inch of thick gooey chocolate sauce. &nbsp;Both were topped with a small amount of homemade ice cream.

The price tag for a three course meal of this quality? &pound;23 (not including drinks). &nbsp;As Hannah pointed out, you'd pay more than that for a three-course meal at Nando's. &nbsp;I can only assume that this state of affairs is temporary. &nbsp;With this quality of food, it is surely only a matter of time before this restaurant becomes the kind of place where you have to book at least a week in advance, if not more. &nbsp;Until then, I'll be taking every opportunity I can to sample the delights on offer."

Ah, but if you get the 0736 to Manchester Piccadilly, you can change at Banbury. &nbsp;There are trains to London Marylebone from Banbury.<br />Hmm.<br />Have any of you spotted the slight flaw in this plan yet?<br />The mention of Manchester may have given it away.<br />You see, London is pretty much directly South-East of Oxford. &nbsp;Banbury is almost directly North. &nbsp;Quite a long way North too really, when you compare it to, oh, I don't know, the distance to London, maybe? &nbsp;So here we were, being told to <em>go in the wrong direction</em> in order to reach our destination. &nbsp;But hey, this is public transport, you do that all the time, right? &nbsp;So about 60 of us traipsed over to Platform 2 (again, something horribly wrong here!) and got on the mystery train to Banbury. &nbsp;Just as we got on, we were nearly told over the tannoy to change at Manchester, which did cause some minor amusement...<br />About half an hour later, we arrive at Banbury, where the nice train driver man tells us that the next train to Marylebone is the 0812 and we all think &quot;gosh, what a nice helpful train driver man&quot;. &nbsp;So we get off the train, walk up the stairs, look at the board, and read &quot;0812 London Marylebone - Train Fault - Cancelled&quot;. &nbsp;Oh. &nbsp;Bother. &nbsp;Well, at least it's just the train. &nbsp;There'll be another one soon, right? &nbsp;Right? &nbsp;Oh, apparently that would be at 0920 or something because it's running late. &nbsp;Um... &nbsp;<br />Surprisingly at this point, everybody did not turn into a ravaging horde and tear the station staff limb from limb. &nbsp;There was some slightly desperate laughter, some phone calls to rearrange meetings, some &quot;er, could you please check to see if there is any other way we can get to London?&quot;, and some sharing of 3G internet, but little to no actual anger. &nbsp;Which was lovely. &nbsp;If it had been Christmas, I can safely say that there would have been screaming and ranting and raving. &nbsp;Maybe people are just more laid back when they're being paid to hang about in the middle of nowhere.<br />Anyhoo, after a while, it was announced that apparently, (embarrassed cough), <small>the signals at Didcot had been fixed and the fastest way for us to get to London was to go back to Oxford.</small>  Except that the next train wasn't for another half hour, and we might then miss the next London train, which they'd try to hold but no guarantees and....<br />So anyway, we did get back to Oxford at 9am exactly, just in time to catch the 0901 to Paddington, which was a teensy bit late and got in at 1020. &nbsp;<br /></lj-cut><br />So I was about half an hour late for my meeting.<br /><br />Which is not half bad for someone who spent 1.5 hours on a well-meant but ultimately pointless jaunt around the Oxfordshire countryside."

I have been wanting to post this for a while but haven't dared.&nbsp; Many of you know this already.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;have signed stuff now, so it's (mostly) official.

I'm a post-doc!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; 

(By the way, that's good) (Also, by the way, no it doesn't mean I've submitted my thesis - that's a whole different matter that we won't touch on here).&nbsp; It does mean that my funding woes are over for the next 18 months, that I have an NHS&nbsp;ID&nbsp;card, a new project in addition to my thesis, a new desk in the Post-Doc office, a Salary(!), a Pension(!!!), and other such exciting things.

New project is very similar to thesis project, but monitoring adults in the Emergency Department (ED), which is what the cool kids call Casualty these days, and trying to spot which ones are really unwell and are deteriorating.&nbsp; I get to wander round the ED once a week collecting the data from the monitors (hence the ID card), and there's lots of interesting little research avenues to explore.

Other good things to have happened this week include the arrival of my free iPod nano (in orange), from Swansea, which I&nbsp;won at the Science Festival for filling in a questionnaire, which was a pretty good return on about 5 minutes of my time.&nbsp; Especially as I filled it in because I wanted to actually give them feedback rather than because I wanted to win an iPod.&nbsp; Because, let's face it, no-one ever wins those things.&nbsp; Oh, right...&nbsp; 

Did I&nbsp;mention that I have a salary now?&nbsp; Yay salary!"

"event","&nbsp;I've been volunteering for a while with <a href=""http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/"">Helen and Douglas House</a>, as they are my local children's (and young adult) hospice, and we got so much from the children's hospice movement (both <a href=""http://www.martinhouse.org.uk/"">Martin House</a> and <a href=""http://www.derianhouse.co.uk/"">Derian House</a>) when I was younger. &nbsp;They were literally a lifeline when no-one else was able or willing to help. &nbsp;It's good to be able to give something back, and to do it at Helen House is particularly poignant, as that's where it all started - Helen House was the first children's hospice in the world, and without it, the rest of the movement would not be where it is today. &nbsp;I do all sorts of things - stewarding, profile-raising, face-painting, selling merchandise, making &quot;mocktails&quot;(!) - whatever is needed, and I've recently started going out to fundraising events and groups to talk to them about the work of the charity as well. &nbsp;I think I've started to get a reputation as someone who will pretty much step in and do anything...<br /><br />Earlier this week, I got an email asking for extra volunteers for an event in London called &quot;Newsroom's Got Talent&quot;. &nbsp;It sounded kind of fun - all the newsrooms (ITN, BBC, C4, C5, NBC, Al-jazeera etc) were putting on a kind of X-Factor style talent show, with the staff doing acts, and a celebrity judging panel. &nbsp;There would also be raffles and auctions raising money for the two charities (Helen and Douglas House, and <a href=""http://www.lcdisability.org/"">Leonard Cheshire Disability</a>). &nbsp;Although it was going to be a late finish (not getting away from central London before 11.15pm), and on a Thursday night, it was too much of a fun opportunity to pass up.<br /><br />So off I toddled on Thursday afternoon. &nbsp;The organisers had kindly arranged for me to get a lift with another volunteer, so I didn't have to worry about transport (although we had a bit of fun navigating when we got close to the venue). &nbsp;We were all glammed up, with sashes to identify us as volunteers, and had jobs assigned. &nbsp;These weren't particularly onerous - helping people find their tables, selling raffle tickets, helping run the auction etc. &nbsp;And best of all, there was very little for us to do during the actual show part, so we'd be able to watch! &nbsp;<br /><br />It was very interesting noting the different attitudes of the &quot;celebs&quot;. &nbsp;I'm not exactly a great TV watcher - I'm more of a radio fan, so I didn't recognise many faces, but my experience definitely reinforced my previous opinion. &nbsp;99% of &quot;celebs&quot; act like normal people and are perfectly nice and polite if you're nice and polite to them. &nbsp;The awkward sods tend to be the &quot;wannabes&quot; who no-one has ever heard of anyway. &nbsp;Not that there were many of them (I can only think of two that I had to deal with, and they were very drunk at the time, so it could have just been that). &nbsp;Luckily, all the people on my &quot;assigned&quot; tables were perfectly lovely, even when the catering messed them around a bit. &nbsp;Oh, and Trevor McDonald is a lovely lovely person. &nbsp;He <strong>chose </strong>to come and stand with the volunteers, when he could have been sitting in his VIP seat in the front row. &nbsp;Bless.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it did run over somewhat (we left at 1am instead of 11.30pm), but it was worth it! &nbsp;I don't know how much the charities raised, but it was well into the tens of thousands, which is not bad for one night! &nbsp;And on top of that, I've seen at least one <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1216031/Fiona-Bruce-cowgirl-Jon-Snow-hippy-Newsreaders-youve-seen-before.html"">press article</a> about it , which while being the Daily Fail BBC-bashing (sigh), does at least mention the charities, so that is profile raising ;-)<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","Day 5 (Wednesday) was concerned mostly with being Judged.&nbsp; I am here for a poster competition, after all.&nbsp; Pleb that I am, I didn't recognise any of the judges, although I assume that they were mostly media types...

The first round of judging, in the morning, saw each of us presenting to three judges (out of eight), with each judge coming round individually.&nbsp; We were being marked on our posters, our communication skills, and the impact of our research (iirc).&nbsp; My first judge was very harsh, and I got a clear feeling that he didn't like my poster.&nbsp; The second was rather more promising, but asked quite closed questions, and I ended up with large gaps of silence after answering them.&nbsp; The third was very easy to talk to though, which was a relief, but I somehow felt that one out of three was not&nbsp; a particularly good score...

We were meant to find out which 6 were through to the second round at 12.45 but apparently the judges had a lot of difficultly because the standard was so high.&nbsp; Which, at least, was good news.&nbsp; There was a general feeling of &quot;you can't lose&quot;, since the second-rounders had to be judged again, whereas the rest got to escape this horror and also go home early...&nbsp; Nobody felt confident.&nbsp; The judging had been tough.&nbsp; I think the final six were announced at about 1.15.&nbsp; My name was the third to be called and I was pretty shocked - I honestly didn't think my poster was as good as some of the others, but a lot of the rest said they weren't surprised, and I certainly wasn't surprised by who else was chosen, although the standard had been very high.

Of course, then we had the ordeal of the second judgement.&nbsp; This time four judges came round in pairs, and it turned out to be a lot less intimidating.&nbsp; It was also at this point that we realised that we'd already won stuff - they were choosing the winner, but the rest of us would be runners up, and get to stay on for the posh dinner on Thursday.&nbsp; Oh, and a &pound;200 cheque, which is not to be sniffed at.&nbsp; The winner would get &pound;750.

I didn't actually get much done after that (I did try to go to an event, but it was cancelled), but I toddled along to the Xchange in the evening to find out who had actually won.&nbsp; Of course they left the announcement to the very end, keeping us on tenterhooks, and I ended up as a runner up.&nbsp; The poster that did win was excellent - it was done to look like a tin of Heinz beans but all the details were about dementia.&nbsp; It was very clever, and thoroughly deserved to win.&nbsp; We then hit the town (i.e. Wetherspoons) for a merry evening.

Today has also been quite quiet, although I did have a chance to sit in on a press conference on Swine Flu this morning.&nbsp; It was very instructive to see how to deal with awkward questions (and also to note the difference in the quality of questions from different journalists - let's just say that Ms Daily Mail wasn't exactly Brain of Britain).&nbsp; I looked at some bloodsucking insects through microscopes but wasn't allowed to poke them with sticks, and then went into town to help one of the other girls find appropriate clothes for the dinner...

Tomorrow I finally leave this little bubble of science and return to what passes for the Real World.&nbsp;"

"event","Day three (Monday) started with &ldquo;Sizzling Science&rdquo;, where a celebrity chef (never heard of him, but I'm not exactly a great follower of such people) cooked up a three-course meal in 45 minutes, to a commentary about nutrients and the chemistry of food.  Thoroughly fascinating, and I intend to try the steamed meringues when I get home.  In what was to become something of a habit, I rather cheekily asked to promote the poster session at the beginning of the talk.  I've been very pleasantly surprised that everybody so far has said yes, and that none of the audiences seem to resent it.

Thence to the Austin Pearce building, which has now been renamed the Austin Powers building for the first poster session.  Sadly a very poor attendance, possibly due to the timings we have been given, which clash badly with the lecture that are going on.  Many of the people who do come don't want to talk (or are all talked out by the time they reach my poster, which is right in the middle of the room), but those who do are very enthusiastic. Meet Lord Drayson, who stops and talks for quite a while, and then quite a bit later on, Phil Willis MP.

After the poster session, I had a bit of a break, before the &ldquo;Xchange&rdquo; which is a kind of daily round-up session held in one of the bars.  Slip off early to go to a lecture on Ordnance Survey, given by one of their research guys.  This turns out to be very interesting &ndash; all about how they update maps and the new technologies they are investigating.

Day 4 (Tuesday) I am timetabled for the morning poster session.  Given the poor turnout on Monday, I spend an hour beforehand madly leafleting everyone in sight.  Not sure it makes any difference though &ndash; still pretty quiet.  A lot of people comment that we clash with the lectures.  Some people are quite accusatory.  I try to point out that we didn't choose the times...

I go to see a press conference after lunch.  It's interesting seeing how they're run from the other side.  It was all very friendly I thought &ndash; it will be interesting to try to go to a more controversial one and see how that is handled.  There's one on swine flu on Thursday that I might try to see.

The afternoon is spent in a very long session on archaeological fakes &ndash; thoroughly wonderful.  A wide variety of subjects, and a break in the middle where we had to work out whether 8 items were real or fake.  I got 6/8, which is not bad at all.

Off to the Xchange again in the evening. I foolishly agreed to volunteer to help a couple of the presenters, and at one point was wrapped up in cling film, demonstrating how bacterial mats stop dead birds' wings falling off.  The things I do for science!"

We arrived on Saturday morning and checked into our student rooms at Surrey university (basic but with en-suite), then headed down to the Friary shopping centre for three solid hours of Science Evangelism.  To assist us in this cause, we were provided with copious quantities of pink balloons with which to entice small children, and we duly set about our task of ensuring that every child under seven was supplied with one.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I was pleasantly surprised at how many people were actually prepared to stop and talk to us about our research, although I may be biased, as my research is fairly accessible &ndash; people are aware of meningitis, and it's something that appears in the media on a regular basis.  Having  said that, I did have one person who didn't know what it was.  His heavily pregnant female companion shot him a look as if to say &ldquo;How dare you propose to father my child without knowing what meningitis is?&rdquo;  Whoops...</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">I have managed to visit some of the other attractions as well.  On Saturday evening, a whole bunch of us gatecrashed, um, I mean, attended, &ldquo;The magical chemistry show&rdquo;, which was advertised as particularly suitable for families with children aged 12 and under, and was full of whizzy bangy things.   Excellent.  It also included, as all such things should, a bit at the end where it went a bit wrong and blue fire shot out of the huge test tube and set fire to lots of things that it shouldn't have.  Which is as it should be.</p> <p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Yesterday, we went a bit more highbrow, and saw Simon Singh talk: &ldquo;Why do journalists love stupid equations?&rdquo;, which was very well argued, if a little ranty at times, and lacking in blue fire.  This morning, I'm off to see &ldquo;Sizzling Science&rdquo; on kitchen chemistry before going back to my poster.  I might try to sit in on a press conference or two as well if I can.</p>"

"event","As part of the literature review of Doom (of which more will almost certainly be posted at a later point), I found it necessary to print out a large BibTeX file containing abstract fields.  Which is easy enough, except that I also wanted to print the abstract fields, and I rather wanted it to look like a bibliography rather than a BibTeX file.  <br />Now, pretty much every description of BibTeX on the web seems to include the following words: &quot;BibTeX ignores any field that is not required or optional, so you can include any fields you want in a bibliography entry. It's often a good idea to put all relevant information about a reference in its bibliography entry - even information that may never appear in the bibliography. For example, if you want to keep an abstract of a paper in a computer file, put it in an 'abstract' field in the paper's bibliography entry. The bibliography database file is likely to be as good a place as any for the abstract, and it is possible to design a bibliography style for printing selected abstracts. &quot;<br />So, you might think that someone, somewhere, has designed a bibliography style for printing selected abstracts.&nbsp; Or at least described how to do so.&nbsp; If you know of such a person, please do tell me, I would love to know how to avoid the pain I&nbsp;have just experienced a second time.&nbsp; Of course, if they have, it's kind of hard to search for, as all of the likely search terms are contained in the above extremely unhelpful, extremely common portion of text.&nbsp; <br />Anyhoo.<br />I have a BibTeX file with going on for 400 entries, most of which had abstracts, which I want in a nice hard-copy form for arguing over with red pens and highlighters.&nbsp; Here is how I&nbsp;achieved it, in the hope that none of you will have to suffer as I have:<br /><lj-cut text=""details"">First download and install <a href=""http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/bibtex2html/"">bibtex2html </a>(I went for the linux binary because I'm lazy, and it worked just fine, but there's source there as well).<br />(Optional, I think) Put all your references into a single giant bib file.&nbsp; I think bibtex2html can cope with multiple files, but it's dead easy with one.&nbsp; I&nbsp;used cat for this.<br />Run bibtex2html on your file.&nbsp; I used the -nobibsource option to avoid the little links at the end of each file.&nbsp; The default behaviour is to print out the content of any abstract field (yay!)<br />I then tried to print the resulting file from firefox.&nbsp; Unfortunately, firefox had a fit of the sulks and refused to print more than 31 pages (96 references), which was a bit of a waste of paper.&nbsp; Bizarrely, it would only show 31 pages in the print preview, so this was clearly a Firefox issue.<br />Hmm.&nbsp; Think.<br />Ctrl-A.&nbsp; Ctrl-C.&nbsp; Open Word (boo, hiss).&nbsp; (oh, by the way, I switched over to a windows box halfway through the procedure for no discernable reason.&nbsp; I'm sure openoffice would work just as well).&nbsp; Ctrl-V.&nbsp; Ctrl-Z.&nbsp; Paste-Special -&gt;Unformatted Text.

"event","I've just got back from <a href=""http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/news116.html"">Childish Things 5</a>.&nbsp; This is the second one I've been to, and it was as good as, if not better than, last year's.<br /><br />The show is set up like a kind of variety show, although all the acts have a comedy or musical bent, and frequently both. I think there were fewer different acts than last year, but what there was was better, and there was more material from each act (e.g. Out of the Blue did about 5 songs in 2 different slots).&nbsp; I didn't buy a program - I never do, so I can only remember some of what was on, but I shall review them anyway.<br /><br /><strong>Jo Brand</strong>.&nbsp; Compered the evening excellently.&nbsp; I think her humour works much better live than it seems to on TV.&nbsp; <br /><strong>Patrick Kielty</strong>.&nbsp; Main reaction: the guy can actually sing (not fantastically, but better than I would have imagined).&nbsp; Some excellent material - again he seems to be much better live than recorded.<br /><strong>Sean Lock</strong> - Good, but kind of outshone by some of the other talent<br /><strong>Out of the Blue</strong> - I know there are those who disagree, but I like OOTB.&nbsp; I like acapella in general, and I particularly like the way they inject a bit of humour and theatre into their performances.&nbsp; I was particularly impressed with the way they included the other performers (including those in wheelchairs) in a very natural way in the closing song - it could have looked forced or condecending but it didn't.<br /><strong>Mime Guy</strong> - I didn't catch the guy's name, but he was absolutely painfully funny.&nbsp; I never thought I'd say that about a mime artist.&nbsp; Basically, a reasonably well-known song was played (&quot;Torn&quot; and &quot;Your Song&quot;), and then he mimed to the words.&nbsp; Sometimes to the meaning, sometimes to the sound (e.g. &quot;butt&quot; for &quot;but&quot;), always with the maximum amount of innuendo.&nbsp; A particular highlight was the delayed audience reaction to the action for the line &quot;Now you're in the world&quot;.&nbsp; All I'm going to say is, think of a homophone for &quot;you're in&quot;...<br /><strong>Comedy Store Players</strong>.&nbsp; For those of you who remember Whose Line is it Anyway? (or have seen the interminable repeats on Dave), this included Richard Vranch on the piano.&nbsp; Basically it was a series of WLIIA-style sketches, which went down very well.&nbsp; &quot;Name a place of work&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Factory!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What does the factory make?&quot; &quot;A loss!&quot;&nbsp; Ok, so you're working in a factory that is making... a loss, thankyou Mr SmartArse.&nbsp; This turned into the old favourite &quot;film styles&quot; game, and got extremely impressive when someone called out &quot;rockumentary&quot;<br /><strong>Guitarist from Douglas House</strong>&nbsp; This guy (Ally?&nbsp; I've forgotten his name) has done every Childish Things apparently, and plays at a lot of Helen &amp; Douglas House events - which is what the night was in aid of incidentally.&nbsp; He's a guitarist, singer and songwriter, as well as a guest at Douglas House.&nbsp; He's very good but not usually my taste in music.&nbsp; Tonight was an exception, and I was disappointed that he only did one song.<br /><strong>Guitar duo</strong>.&nbsp; Folky duo.&nbsp; Played one mediocre song and an old favourite.&nbsp; A bit meh.<br /><strong>Guitar girl</strong>.&nbsp; Cross between standup and singing.&nbsp; The stand-up would have been very good for a comedy night, but she didn't stand out against the big guns.<br /><strong>Poet</strong>.&nbsp; Introduced as &quot;controversial&quot; and went on to do his first poem about religious fundamentalism: the Salvation Army.&nbsp; I liked his poems but hated his shouty, fast, too close to the mike delivery.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent night, even though I didn't manage to persuade anyone to come with me *sniff*.&nbsp; But if anyone wants to come next year...&nbsp; Oh, and&nbsp;<lj user=""terpsichore1980""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;will probably be shocked that I struck up conversation with the group of ladies sat next to me."

"event","well, I had a go at getting the spare up and running.

good: it actually wasn't in bad nick
bad: the tyres were flat
worse: I didn't have the right adaptor
good: the bike shop (Walton St cycles) sold me one for &pound;1
fantastic: they also gave me FOR&nbsp;FREE a new fixing for my front light
bad: I still couldn't get the tyres to pump
good: but the internet showed me how
bad: but it still didn't work on the back tyre
good: back at the bike shop, the nice man pumped my tyres up FOR&nbsp;FREE
excellent: neither of them have major leaks (we'll see about slow leaks in the next few days)
bad: the back mudguard was rubbing against the tyre
worse: I think this might be partly because either the tyre or the wheel needs replacing
better: re-seating the wheel seems to have worked
slightly worrying: I still think the tyre or wheel (or both)&nbsp;will need replacing though
good: it actually works!

I cycled it round the car park a couple of times and it seemed ok. &nbsp;So for a grand outlay of one new pound, I have a working bike again. &nbsp;I still need a new helmet and back light, and another lock, but it's looking promising."

"event","&nbsp;For the first time in the nearly 8 years I&nbsp;have lived in Oxford, I have had my &nbsp;bike stolen. &nbsp;Yes, it was locked up with two locks (through the frame, both wheels and the bike racks), but it was overnight at the station, so it was pretty high risk.&nbsp;
Tomorrow, conveniently, my diary is clear, so I can use the time to buy 2 new locks, a helmet (it was locked up too), and attempt to get my spare bike into rideable condition. &nbsp; Then we will discover if it has enough gears to get me up Morrell Avenue...
I've reported it to the police, just in case, but I don't hold out much hope of it returning. &nbsp;It wasn't insured as it fundamentally wasn't worth it - it was pretty old and was starting to die (hence the existence of the Spare). &nbsp;The gears in particular were not long for this world, and I doubt it would have lasted another year. &nbsp;I'm surprisingly sanguine about the whole affair.

"event","I thought it might be interesting to at least some of you if I write about my progress through the application process for obtaining CEng registration from the IET.&nbsp; I'd like to keep the posts public, so I'll try to put most of the detail in a cut so that it doesn't fill up your friends pages.&nbsp; <br /><lj-cut text=""Part the second. In which I Make A Start, and then discover that it's more like a middle""><br />I've already written about <a href=""http://susannahf.livejournal.com/43659.html"">my experiences on the IET's &quot;Working with Competences&quot; course</a>, so this counts as part two.&nbsp; <br />I like recording things electronically, and preferably in the cloud somewhere, so that I can access it whenever I want.&nbsp; So I've been slowly adding stuff to the <a href=""http://www.theiet.org/careers/cmanager/index.cfm"">IET's Career Manager</a> for about a year.&nbsp; I quite like the idea of this, as it allows you to do 90% of the application process online in one place, although you still have to send in your payment and development action plan through another channel.&nbsp; The site is mostly intuitive to use, although there are a few odd bits - like putting employment under &quot;professional experience&quot;, rather than in a section of its own.&nbsp; I'm also not overly impressed with the way the &quot;personal development&quot; section only allows one action per competence, which doesn't seem enough to me - the competences are quite broad, so I would have thought that you generally need more than one action to improve your level of competence.<br />The IET has recently created a <a href=""http://tv.theiet.org/channels/news/1563.cfm"">training film</a> about using Career Manager.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this requires either Windows Media Player or Real Player, and it doesn't work on Windows unless you use Internet Exploder and the latest version of the plugin (bah!&nbsp; humbug!).&nbsp; In fact, I couldn't get it to work at all on my home machine - IE just crashed every time I tried to watch the film.&nbsp; Hopefully, they'll iron this out in time, because it looks like there is a lot of good content on their site, and certainly the Career Manager film was very helpful, even if it was over half an hour long.<br />Things I learned from the film:<br />1) you don't need to be an expert in every competence to apply.&nbsp; I had already found this out on the competences course, but I hadn't realised what level they were really looking for.&nbsp; The film seems to imply that you should be aiming for &quot;Practitioner&quot; level on average, with hopefully a couple of &quot;Expert&quot;s and not too many &quot;Supervised Practitioner&quot;s.&nbsp; You shouldn't be at &quot;Trainee&quot; on any competence.&nbsp; Unless I'm completely overestimating my competences, this means I should be fine, as I'm on Practitioner or Expert for nearly everything.&nbsp; <br />2) You can put in an RPD form (declaring that you are working towards CEng registration) even if you haven't sorted out a Sponsor and Mentor yet.&nbsp; I can probably ask my supervisor to be my sponsor (he's a FIET), and I do now have an IET mentor (just), but I don't really want the IET to spam them with loads of stuff until I'm nearly ready to apply.&nbsp; So I hadn't put in an RPD form.&nbsp; But apparently, if you put one in, you get regular contact with sources of support and information about applying.&nbsp; So I did that on Tuesday (you can do it entirely online from Career Manager) - more of this later.<br />3) You can &quot;archive&quot; up to 8 competence assessments.&nbsp; This makes them read-only, but you can still edit the live version.&nbsp; You can then issue &quot;guest passes&quot;, so that people can see and comment on your assessments - this is designed so that mentors / sponsors / professional registration advisors and so on can comment on your assessments, and also, when you get to the point of applying, you can get people to &quot;verify&quot; your evidence - i.e. certify that you have done what you've said you've done.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've used this to archive a version where I simply listed everything I've ever done that could be used as evidence for a competence.&nbsp; I'm now writing more detailed application-like ones with only one or two pieces of evidence for each competence, but it's useful to have a record if I need to refer back to the list in the future.&nbsp; You can also export these to Word, which might also be helpful. (By the way, I'm happy to issue &quot;guest passes&quot; if people are curious about what I've written - leave a note in a comment or email me if you want one)<br />4) You send in a separate copy of your action plan for the final application.&nbsp; This had previously worried me, as I couldn't smoosh my action plan into the wierd &quot;personal development&quot; format used in Career Manager without losing a lot of the meaning.<br /><br />There are a couple of people who are considered useful, if not essential, in preparing for a CEng application.&nbsp; The first is a mentor, so I applied for one of these in January.&nbsp; Despite the dire warnings that there were more mentees than mentors, I was assigned one almost immediately, and then assigned another equally quickly when the first turned out to be on an overseas posting...&nbsp; Your mileage may vary - they try to pair you up based on geography, so I expect some areas are more difficult.&nbsp; Diaries being what they are, I won't actually meet my mentor until early March, but I'm quite optimistic - although I'm his first IET mentee, he's mentored a lot of people at work, including helping people with the CEng process, so that's pretty hopeful.<br />The second person is the PRA, or professional registration advisor.&nbsp; These are people who the IET have trained to, well, advise people on professional registration.&nbsp; It sounds like it would be best if I get a first draft of the application ready before contacting one, but I'm hoping they'll be able to go over it and make sure I'm not doing something stupid.<br /><br />Back to the RPD form (remember that?).&nbsp; I submitted it on Tuesday, via Career Manager.&nbsp; The submission doesn't include all the competences stuff, but does include anything you've written under the employment section (among other things).&nbsp; On Wednesday, I got a very sweet email from a lady in the Professional Development department saying that she'd looked at my form and wondered if I was ready to consider submitting and application for professional registration based on my existing experience.&nbsp; Which is very comforting - it implies that I ought to be on track to submit this year, which is what I've planned.&nbsp; I wrote back to say thankyou, but I need to get the paperwork together, and that this isn't something I can do very fast while also trying to finish my DPhil research and write my thesis...&nbsp; But overall, I'm quite pleased - I'm a bit of a perfectionist and I tend to look at my evidence and go &quot;but, if I wait a year, I'll have much better evidence&quot;.&nbsp; Which is, of course, true, but it will always be true, and at some point I have to be able to draw a line in the sand and say, &quot;I'm ready&quot;. <br />I think that point is now.</lj-cut>"

I used <a href=""http://cp.c-ij.com/en/contents/3151/03339/index.html"">this template</a> to create the world (by tracing and painting as I don't have a colour printer) - I highly recommend it if anyone wants to play with making a sphere out of card.  I would suggest actually reading and following the instructions though, as I ended up with a southern hemisphere that was about 3mm larger than the northern hemisphere...<br />&quot;Jesus&quot; was made out of a mini-maglite, with pipe-cleaner arms, a hand-sewn cloth robe, and two glass pebbles for the head.  These were stuck on top of the maglite with sellotape (having been PVA-d back to back), and reflected the light pretty effectively. <br />The hat part was slightly faulty - it was very top-heavy and kept trying to slide off, not helped by the failure of one of the ties halfway through the starter.  I fixed it later, and managed to eat most of my main course and dessert wearing it, which was quite a challenge as I couldn't bend my head very far at all."

"event","My parents have been bugging me for a while about this - mainly because I haven't found them a solution and switchover happens for them next year. 

Basically, they need to sort out a sensible way of making and viewing recordings of digital TV.&nbsp; Now, an ordinary person would just get a PVR and be done with it, but this isn't going to be such a simple solution, for reasons that will soon become clear.
&nbsp;
There are 4 TVs.&nbsp; TV1 (front room) currently has digibox, video and DVD connected, and is used for most viewing.&nbsp; ""Pause live TV"" functionality would be very useful here.&nbsp; Currently, this video is the one where most recordings are programmed.&nbsp; TV2 (bedroom) is on a mobile trolley with a video, and (I believe) a DVD.&nbsp; This is where many recordings made downstairs are actually watched, although it is sometimes used for recording.&nbsp; TV3 (kitchen) has a video, which is used for recording when simultaneous two channel recording is required (reception on TV2 is inferior due to indoor aerial, but this could be fixed), but is rarely used for watching non-live TV.&nbsp; TV4 (spare room) is a stand-alone on an indoor aerial and can probably be removed from the current equation.

So, a design brief:
Required
1) Able to watch one channel while recording another
2) Able to record in one place but watch in another, without knowing in advance where a particular recording will be watched
3) Ease of use 
Optional
4) Able to pause live tv (they can't do this now, but I'm certain they'd use it a lot if they could)
5) Able to record 2 channels at once
6) Able to record 1 channel while watching a recording

Adding wiring is not a problem.&nbsp; Broadband access is (they are very rural and have slow broadband), so, for instance, iPlayer would not be an option.

I'm struggling.&nbsp; My best idea so far is a combination of <a href=""http://http://www.slingmedia.com/go/slingbox"">slingbox</a> (downstairs, attached to PVR), and <a href=""http://www.slingmedia.com/go/slingcatcher"">slingcatcher</a> (upstairs).&nbsp; Other thoughts are PVR with DVD-writer (but how long would it take to write the DVD?); PVR with ethernet connection (internal networking isn't a problem, but how do we play it out upstairs?); PVR with USB port and a key to move stuff round (again, playout?).&nbsp; 
Any ideas?&nbsp; Anyone tried any of this stuff?&nbsp; I know the Parkview Rd gang had a topfield PVR which had some sort of connectivity, but would it do this?
As an interim solution, I intend to teach them to record off the digibox onto VHS at Christmas, but I strongly suspect that this will fail requirement (3) for a long-term solution.

Edit: mpj has suggested a freeview DVD recorder.  Do these exist (I haven't seen any), and how do DVD recordings compare to VHS in terms of cost and being able to re-use discs?"

"event","I am a media whore.&nbsp; <br />Last week, I was asked by the EPSRC if I would be prepared to attend a press conference for the announcement of a new wave of <a href=""http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/PressReleases/%C2%A3250Million.htm"">Doctoral Training Centres</a> (PhD courses like the one I'm on, with the extra taught year).&nbsp; Well, you don't say no to your funding body do you?&nbsp; <br />On Tuesday, I was filmed by <a href=""http://www.tvnewsrelease.com/serv_tnr.asp"">TNR</a>, who were producing a &quot;B-roll&quot; of footage for the EPSRC to make available.&nbsp; They filmed me demonstrating my monitoring system on a very patient young boy at the John Radcliffe Hospital.&nbsp; This caused some slight panic as I'd only got the software working on my PC (and was in the middle of breaking it while integrating a new codebase), but I finally managed to get a version from a couple of weeks ago running on the tablet PC, and I think it looked pretty professional.&nbsp; Once they had filmed us from a multitude of angles, I did a couple of &quot;soundbite&quot; pieces to camera about how wonderful the DTC is and what I'm doing for my research.&nbsp; They then came up to my lab to get a couple of shots of me &quot;working&quot; on the computer.&nbsp; I don't know if or when this footage will be used, but if you think you see me on the news, you're probably right (and please tell me, as I probably won't see me!).<br />Then yesterday, I was on the &quot;panel&quot; for a press conference to announce the funding.&nbsp; I was sat next to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Drayson,_Baron_Drayson"">Lord Drayson</a>, who holds the wonderful title of Minister of State for Science, and had to give a 5 minute talk after his announcement (again covering the wondrousness of the DTC and my research).&nbsp; It was thoroughly nerve-wracking, but apparently I came over pretty well.&nbsp; I was then nabbed by Mark Henderson of the Times for an interview, and a very long photo session - apparently the light was tricky...&nbsp; There were other photos later with the freelance photographer, so again, could turn up anywhere.&nbsp; <br />Then in the afternoon, I got a call from Radio 5Live, asking me if I could be interviewed on their breakfast programme.&nbsp; So up I got for a taxi to the Oxford studios at 0640, only for said taxi to completely fail to turn up, so I was on the landline instead.&nbsp; The interview was live at about 0730, and with any luck should be on the iPlayer later (I'll post a link when it's available).&nbsp; I thought it went awfully, my parents think it was great.&nbsp; I'll leave you to judge for yourself.<br />So far, the only story I've seen with me in is <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article5289280.ece"">this one in the Times</a> (unsurprisingly given the reporter's keenness), but I'm hoping Google and the hivemind will alert me to any others.&nbsp; Obviously there are lots of reports about the announcement that don't have me in, but let's face it, we're not interested in those, are we?<br /><br /><strong>Edit</strong>: Interview is now available on <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00fq8cd/b00fq6r0/5_live_Breakfast_05_12_2008/"">iPlayer </a>until 0902am 12th December.&nbsp; My interview is from 1:26:57 to 1:31:28 if you don't want to listen to the full 3 hours.<br />More footage on <a href=""http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/VideoAudio/CDTVideo.htm"">the EPSRC website</a>, which has odd clips of me in it.<br /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","I'm sure that version control can help with at least some of my problem.&nbsp; But I'm not exactly sure how.
I have 2 large Visual Studio projects (one in 2003 and one in 2005 - don't ask...)&nbsp; I am altering the code to do what I want.&nbsp; Oh, there are also associated config files in a complex directory structure which VS doesn't know about, and I'd rather it stayed that way.
At the moment, I&nbsp;make my changes, marking them with a unique string in surrounding comments.&nbsp; Then, when I get emailed a new version of the code, I do searches, and integrate my code with theirs.&nbsp; New versions arrive irregularly and infrequently - the first one has just arrived and I'm going &quot;ick&quot; at the work involved...
Maintaining a repository that we both use is impractical - my changes are only of interest to me, we are remote from each other, and the code is proprietary, so putting it up on the intertubes would be a non-starter.
The question is, can I do some sort of version control that will pretend that a user (the other developers) has checked out the code at a particular point (when the last email arrived), and then checks it back in (when a new email arrives), during which time I&nbsp;have also made changes.
So that rules out locking systems, I guess....
I know that there will be conflicts, and I fully expect to manage them manually, but it would be nice to have them flagged up to me and stuff.&nbsp; 
Ideally I'd like it to work on Windows, but I can access the files on Linux, so that's an option, but it would have to play nice with VS (i.e. not change line endings etc).
Suggestions?
Oh, and I do have a pristine copy of the original version before I made any changes, in case that matters."

"event","I didn't go into the lab today.&nbsp; The reasons for this are three: one - I wanted to do other stuff, two - I had a truly hellish migraine over the w/e and wanted to get some R&amp;R to prevent another one, and three - I was going to this lecture at 2.30 and couldn't be bothered to cycle to the lab for just a couple of hours.

The great thing is, this lecture was by Jorge Cham, creator of <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php"">PhD Comics</a>, and billed by MPLS[1] as a ""skills training"" session.&nbsp; So, it was nearly like working!&nbsp; And it was hilarious.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's also talking at Southampton and IC <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/speaking.htm"">this week</a>, so go if you can.&nbsp; 

<lj-cut text=""Minor spoilers and a poll"">
I'm not sure if the talk had a title as such, but if it did, it would be ""The Power of Procratination"".&nbsp; He quotes some pretty interesting stats, including a comparison of the average grad stipend with the minimum wage for someone at MaccyD's.&nbsp; There's also some scary stuff about the mental health of grad students.&nbsp; About a two thirds feel hopeless or depressed at some point, and 10% seriously consider suicide.&nbsp; More scary - 0.5% (1 in 200) actually attempt it!&nbsp; That's a <strong>huge </strong>amount!&nbsp; So a lot of the talk is about why procrastination isn't necessarily bad, you don't have to feel guilty, and you will (probably, eventually) graduate.&nbsp; It's all done in a very humourous way, with lots of illustrations from the comics.

This leaves me with a bit of a decision, though.&nbsp; I'm currently writing my report for <a href=""http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/gso/forms/#_Toc27557428"">confirmation of status</a>, which is an apparently random thing you have to do between transfer of status, and submitting your thesis.&nbsp; Two of the things it has to include are ""A list detailing attendance at skills training courses, both within and outside              the Engineering Department"" and ""Brief details of attendance at seminars, conferences etc"".&nbsp; So I turn to an LJ poll for help:

<lj-cut text=""All the details..."">
Actually getting to the wedding in the first place was rather exciting, as the nearest rail station is a 40 minute drive away, and the airports are about 2-3 hours away.&nbsp; We (myself and three other random friends of the couple who had been matchmade over the internet for the purposes of travel) flew from Luton to Bordeaux on Friday, hired a car, drove to Meyssac without too much incident, and then proceeded to get completely and utterly lost trying to find Puy D'Arnac, where we were to pick up keys to the gite.&nbsp; Hannah got us unlost, Russell gave us the keys, and directed us to food, and thence to our gite.&nbsp; We arrived in Billac (or Bilhac, depending on your map) at about 11pm, in the dark, and couldn't figure out which of the dark-looking houses we were meant to be unlocking.&nbsp; After trying and running away from about 4 houses, we apologetically phoned Russell, found the house, and let ourselves in.&nbsp; At which point, the other three declared it to be haunted.&nbsp; Admittedly, there were some rather scary dolls (a Chucky look-a-like and a battered clown with half a mouth), no visible showering or bathing facilities, and a general feel that the house had not been lived in since some time in the 70s, but still...&nbsp; Needless to say, the fears were groundless, there was in fact a shower (although you had to go outside and into the basement to find it), and the people who owned it were very lovely and not at all spooky.

The wedding itself was lovely.&nbsp; It was in the local catholic church (Meyssac), although they imported a protestant minister from Scotland to do the ceremony, and most of the service was translated into both French and English for the benefit of the mixed congregation.&nbsp; The final ""hymn"" had been written by the groom's father to the tune of ""King of the Road"", and the couple walzed down the aisle to it.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Ballroom waltz down a very narrow aisle.&nbsp; Very impressive.

After the wedding, the entire congregation proceeded in a very raucous motor convoy (with much tooting of horns), to Puy D'Arnac, for the ""Vin d'Honor"" (sp?).&nbsp; Apparently such convoys are traditional in France, and certainly nobody on the roadside seemed to be annoyed - even the game hunters, whose quarry we had undoubtedly scared off, stood at the side of the roads with their shotguns and grinned.&nbsp; The Vin d'Honor consisted of drinks (obviously), and literally thousands of lovely canapes made by Russell's family.&nbsp; Then another convoy to Nonards for the big reception (food, wine, dancing, cake).&nbsp; The meal was very French - lots of small, amazing courses, lasting many hours, and included my first taste of Fois Gras.&nbsp; I'm not sure how I feel about this - ethically it worries me, but it tastes fantastic...&nbsp; The speeches were pretty amusing, although it got a bit embarrassing when the father of the bride mixed his son-in-law and the best man up three times.&nbsp; The music was, um, varied, but there was lots of happy dancing.&nbsp; I think it was the fact that the people I was dancing with knew each other at 18 - so we had no inhibitions, as we knew that the others had seen worse!&nbsp; 

Next day, having survived another night in the slightly spooky house, it was back to Puy d'Arnac for more jollity (and more food).&nbsp; One interesting part was the opening of the presents.&nbsp; They had them all on a big table, and everyone sat around watching them open them.&nbsp; It was really nice seeing what other people had got them, and I thought it was a lovely touch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the evening, there was a bonfire, which gave the men a chance to be manly and beat out the flames when they started spreading to the grass.
</lj-cut>

All in all, it was a fantastic weekend."

"event","I was a shadow yesterday.&nbsp; I shadowed one of my clinical collaborators on a shift at the out-of-hours GP surgery.&nbsp; It was great.
The ostensible reason for this was to gain a greater insight into the clinical workflow, which could then inform the design of monitoring equipment for use in this environment.&nbsp; The deep-down reason is that I put it on my RAEng application because it sounded cool, and so now I either have to do it, or explain why not doing it is a good idea.&nbsp; I'm glad that I'm a coward, and didn't want to do the explaining bit.
Organising the shadowing took quite a bit of time - the GP I was shadowing was quite keen to help, but it was tricky finding an appropriate time, particularly over the summer.&nbsp; But I'm really glad I stuck at it - I was able to get a really good idea of how the whole out-of-hours system works, and actually see the place where we'll be (ethics willing) carrying out Phase I of our clinical trial.&nbsp; 
I was even allowed to sit in on some consultations (with the patients' consent, of course).&nbsp; This was probably the most useful of all, as after each patient, the GP explained why he had done what he'd done, what sort of options there were, and how (or even if) he would have used a monitor if it was available.&nbsp; My work is mostly based on kids, so it was particularly useful to see their consultations, and how and when their vital signs were monitored.

Theoretically, I'm also meant to shadow a paediatric ED person.&nbsp; This will be more tricky still to organise (I don't have a convenient collaborator to be shadowed), so I might wait a month or so until the heat of work is off a bit before tackling that one."

"event","Yesterday, I finally managed to attend the IET's ""Working with competences"" course, after leaving it too late to book one, and having the second cancelled.&nbsp; It didn't start well, as all of the students had been told to arrive at 9, whereas the tutor thought we were starting at 10.&nbsp; An extra hour in bed would have been very welcome!
Despite the inauspicious start, the course was great.&nbsp; I was a bit worried that it would be aimed at managers and people sponsoring or assessing for CEng, but it was actually aimed at people like me who want to apply, and everybody else on the course was in a similar situation.&nbsp; There was even another person from a research background, who was having the same problems as me in relating some of the <a href=""http://www.engc.org.uk/ukspec/default.aspx"">UK-SPEC</a> competences to her work.
A lot of the course was revision of stuff that I already knew from reading about the CEng process, but it was being delivered by someone who knows the system inside-out, so there were insights and tips that you could never get from reading the official information.
For me, the most useful aspect was that you don't actually have to reach ""expert"" level in all 16 competences to apply - this was a misconception that quite a few of us held, and was preventing us from applying even though we probably had enough experience.&nbsp; For example, even if you don't lead a team at work, if you can show that you have some leadership experience (e.g. from voluntary work or a small project at work), you can use that, and it won't necessarily matter that you aren't a ""manager"", so long as you have other competences where you are strong, particularly in the A and B sections.
I don't have all the paperwork together yet, but I'm well on the way, and if all goes well, I might be able to apply in the next year."

The reason for this is that ""Bluetooth Support Service"" was not only not enabled, it wasn't even in the services list.&nbsp; So no Bluetooth stack, and thus no Bluetooth.&nbsp; Sad bunnies.
For some people, the registry hackery <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911894"">here </a>apparently works.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for me it failed at Step 9 ""Verify that the Bluetooth Support Service is now started. Also, verify that the missing icon in the notification area and the item in Control Panel for the Bluetooth Support Service appear.""&nbsp; There is no Step 10...
Eventually, I discovered that a third-party Bluetooth stack might work.&nbsp; So I installed the <a href=""http://www.broadcom.com/products/bluetooth_update.php"">Widcomm/Broadcom stack</a> (being the one I believed to be most likely to be compatible with my dongle).&nbsp; There are others.&nbsp; Some apparently work better with some hardware.
Anyhoo, it all works now, so I can stop the insane procedure of developing code on one machine, then transferring it by USB stick to another (which has no debugging facilities and only a touch screen as a human interface) to test it.&nbsp; This will make me much more efficient, and much less grumpy.&nbsp; Happy bunnies!"

"event","As promised, the report on EMBC.
<lj-cut text=""academic details..."">This is the fourth conference I've been to, and it dwarfs the others by quite a margin (even the RCPCH conference didn't have 13 parallel sessions).&nbsp; The hefty inch-thick tome we were issued only contains the abstracts - full papers are on the accompanying DVD.&nbsp; The conference ran from 9-5 over 3.5 days (not including the first day, which was all workshops, which cost extra), with 2 plenaries, 3 oral sessions, and 2 poster sessions per day.&nbsp; Just simply looking through the paper titles to figure out which sessions to go to took half an hour or so per day, since the track themes are broad by necessity, so you daren't overlook a track unless it's absolutely not going to contain something of interest.&nbsp; 
There were some very good presentations and posters, and I have a list of nearly 20 papers that I want to read in full.&nbsp; However, there were also a few that made me wonder what academic value they actually held.&nbsp; These were mainly in the poster sessions though, so I wonder if they accept all papers that aren't complete tosh, but put all the slightly dodgy ones into the poster session.&nbsp; Which is a bit of a shame if it's true, as most of the posters were very good, so it's not fair to tarnish their reputations by letting in poor ones.&nbsp; Of course, I haven't read the papers to go with those posters, so it's possible that the authors managed to write a good paper, but just completely failed to turn it into a poster of any academic worth.
There were also a fair few projects that seemed to be hammers looking for nails.&nbsp; I guess I'm pretty lucky to have such helpful and keen clinical collaborators - a lot of biomedical engineers seem to have a lot of difficulty getting useful clinical input, so it's probably quite easy to fall into that trap.
In terms of my presentation, it all went pretty well - in hindsight of course - at the time, I was petrified.&nbsp; I got two ""official"" questions (i.e. during the Q&amp;A session directly following my talk), of which one was tricky but made a useful point that I can incorporate into our clinical trials, and one asked a question that I'd prepared for, and was completely confident in answering, which was very kind of him!&nbsp; (He wasn't even a plant, either)&nbsp; After the session finished, about 5 other people came up to ask me more detailed questions, and a couple of other people found me later on in the conference, so I guess it was pretty well received.&nbsp; One even suggested that the work should be published in a journal rather than conferences, which is something I'd really like to do, so it's nice to know that other people think my work is worthwhile.
Apparently the proceedings get indexed on PubMed and Medline, which is quite exciting for me.&nbsp; PubMed is my primary search tool for medical papers, so I'm pretty chuffed that my paper might be on it.&nbsp; None of the online proceedings are up yet though (not even on the IEEE site), and I guess it will take time to index them for PubMed, so it might be a while before it arrives there.&nbsp; But still... my first properly peer-reviewed paper!&nbsp; I'm not counting the WASET one, as I just don't trust their peer review process now - I didn't even get any review comments back from it, and virtually no paper is that perfect.
So, all in all, a very worthwhile and successful trip.&nbsp; With any luck, I'll be going to EMBC '09 in Minneapolis.</lj-cut>"

"event","On Friday, I got back from my Canadian trip - 7 days in Vancouver (including a 4-day conference), then 3 days in Montreal.&nbsp; It was great right up to the last afternoon, but more of that later.

Vancouver was as lovely as I remember it, although somewhat more damp.&nbsp; Specifically, on any day that it was possible for us to go up Grouse Mountain, it either rained torrentially or the cloudbase was somewhere in the foothills.&nbsp; However, we did manage to do lots of touristy things, including Stanley Park (with totem poles), the Aquarium, where I managed to take pretty pictures of jellyfish, and rubbish pictures of a bird, the Capilano suspension bridge (more totem poles), and (after much getting lost on the UBC campus), the Museum of Anthropology, where I was unable to fully appreciate the totem poles due to overexposure to them everywhere else.  On the last day, we got the unfeasibly small and cute ""Aquabus"" to Granville Island, which was nice, but not as good as I remembered.  Oh, we also walked along East Hastings Street by accident.  We didn't get killed or mugged.  This was an achievement, not only because of the street's reputation, but because there was a <i>really</i> dodgy guy following us.

The conference went reasonably well, and will probably be covered in more detail in a later post.  Suffice to say that people seemed interested in my talk, and I didn't fluff it.

Montreal made up for Vancouver's weather by being blazingly hot and sunny every day, which was nice.  We traipsed around the old city for a day, discovering quite how European it looked.  Even the statues of Jesus and Mary on the churches had EU-flag stars around their heads...  We discovered that the Montreal flag appears to be a St George Cross with the flowers of the Union in the four quadrants, and that pointing this out to the French-speaking Quebecqois is not the most prudent action.  Montreal clearly did have a fairly large ex-British population at some early point, as street names such as ""Rue McTavish"" and the statue of Nelson prove.  On the second day, we hiked up Mont Royal, which is not a mountain, but does have pretty views from the top, and then crashed in the McGill University park to watch all the Freshers be told how to enjoy themselves by a guy with a megaphone.

On the last day (Thursday), we wandered round the Latin quarter, which turned out to be 2 streets, so we wandered back to the underground mall to partake of its air-conditioning.  There we received a text alerting us to possible issues with our airline, Zoom.  I'd seen something on the morning news about a flight being grounded the previous day, so Mel had asked his sister to keep an eye on the news for us.  By the time we found an internet cafe (which incidentally was free!), Zoom had gone bust, leaving us stranded with no backup (my insurance doesn't cover airline liquidation, and we'd booked direct so we weren't covered by ABTA or anything either).  Having failed to buy the one remaining BA ticket quickly enough, the only other option for getting back in the near future (i.e. before about Wednesday) was business class on Air Canada at a price that made you suck the air through your teeth.  We reserved the tickets online and legged it for the airport.  The Air Canada lady was lovely, even though we had slight payment issues as neither of us had credit cards that would stand for the whole amount for 2 tickets.  We were about halfway through the transaction when she realised that we were stranded Zoom passengers, and not, as she had previously thought, minor royalty.  Still, we managed to buy the tickets and were safely in the executive lounge by the time that it would have all started kicking off in departures (ours being the only Zoom flight out of Montreal that evening).

Flying business class is Very Nice, even though we only had flat-beds for the short hop to Toronto, and not for the transatlantic portion.  We got into Heathrow only an hour after we should have arrived at Gatwick, and I even made it to the Kingswood reunion in the evening.  

At the moment, I'm not sure whether I'll be able to recover the Air Canada money from the University, or fall back on my parental safety-net.  But even if I'd been paying it all myself, I'm glad we bought those tickets.  The other options would most likely have cost nearly as much, but would have involved being trapped in Montreal, and generally being stressed for days rather than hours."

"event","You may recall that <a href=""http://susannahf.livejournal.com/41883.html"">my digibox got trashed</a> a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; At the time, Daewoo were particularly unhelpful, but I decided not to take it lying down.&nbsp; On the Daewoo website, I found that the instruction booklet for the broken box claimed that it was ""fully DVB compliant"".&nbsp; Now this is clearly untrue, as if it was compliant, it wouldn't have broken with the transmission changes.
So I sent another email, quoting chapter and verse of the DVB specification, and threatening them with Trading Standards if they didn't accept that they had sold something that was unfit for purpose.&nbsp; A short while later, I get an email from a high-up offering me a free set-top box, which was delivered yesterday, and is now happily playing TV to me.
I am a happy bunny."

I started feeling a bit more comfortable with C# when I managed to spot a bug in the code.&nbsp; It was a fairly trivial fix, but actually checking that it was a bug and then testing the fix required me to run up and down the stairs a few times in order to get my heart rate above 127 beats per minute..."

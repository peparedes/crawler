""OMG IM A PHOTO MAJOR...  ON NOEZ I FUCKED UP MY FILM... OH NOEZ I DONT GOT NO FILTERZ... OH NOEZ (etc.)""

So I've been living with gabrielle for a month now, and it's super. I'm mad behind on work, and im borderline destitute, which makes life more interesting. I work on the Oddessy cruiseship, taking photos of the people boarding, and then selling them back to them for 20 dollars. My job is the embodiment of rip off, but hey, its money right? I'm really sick of like everyone, I detest almost everyone in the Massart photo department, and mostly everyone actually.

My new pet peeve: people who brag and people who's senteces start with ""I""

""OMGZZZZZ I GOT A NEW 4x5 CAMERA FOR 5000DOLLARS OMGZ, ITS EZ 2 PAY 4 THO, CUZ I GOT A FIFTYDOLLAR AN HOUR JOB AT A GALLERY, SO ITS COOL LOLOLOLOL""

It seems to be a new trend to not answer me when i talk to you over the internet, be it over aim or livejournal, or myspace, or whatever... it really gets on my nerves, this is the whole reason i have such few friends- it's because no one is genuine, which really gets to me. All I've been doing recently is getting angry over stupid artwork, saying i need a job, and playing Guitar Hero (&lt;3). Yesterday I got incredibly angry over nothing (Seriously, nothing) and Gabrielle thinks i was mad at her, which i wasn't. Perhaps i should get a perscription for those chill pills i hear so much about<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v225/mrrobertking/robert.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><br />Seriously, though, should I cut my hair?"

"event","I'm going to make a serious entry, I swear. So I'm having issues with the demon that calls herself my mother, and every time i come home, i feel as if im going to have a nervous breakdown- shes a miserable awful woman. And this whole apartment thing is crashing down because of her. At least i'll be living with gabrielle, which is the #1 stress and pain reliever in america, as said by the FDA. Most of my work is caught up, i just need to build a stupid form study thing for next wednesday, but that shouldnt be too hard. Then i have my final for government which is going to be a six page paper, which once again shouldnt be too bad, and my final for art history is already complete (i think i passed). as for drawing, im doing a series of photographs inspired by andy worhol, ill need a couple male and female nude models, but i know 3 who are willing, but ill need a male and one more female. and my visual language final is pivitol on gabrielle that she gets the html completed for me, so that i may continue making the website. after that, school will be over, which scares me, because ill have to be in this hell hole for the rest of the summer; hopefully ill get a job, so i can... you know, live. I went to best buy with the coolest AZN ever (Joy) and i got an XBOX 360 live-strong braclet, suprisingly, it isnt HUEG. The summer is going to be awful, i cant wait until i can live with gabrielle, and no one is going to get in my way and stop me. i really hate people who get off really well and do nothing for it, but people who did nothing wrong and work their asses off are raped just because of circumstance. 

by the way, if you need any photography done for you, I'm lowering my prices, and also, ive gotten a lot better, so tell me when, ok?"

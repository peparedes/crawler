Im not really sure who it was. 
It was probably Jump 5. 
My friend got me their first CD and i was HOOKED! I bought the how to dance and interveiw videos and all the cd's and i even went to a concert (one of there only ones near me). 
I loved them and i was so mad when i wasnt allowed to get there autograph because the line was to long and we would have had to waited till midnight. I was sad but my mom bought me the poster that was pre-signed.
Now they are done, i dont think they have made a new CD since 2005."

We already rented a car but now one person cancelled so we are on the look out for someone to join us.

Maybe someone out there that doesnt mind jolly people and sing campfire songs :P
But if you have any interest on going with us (by car) hit me up or leave a message."

As we are lost 
We will find our way

As we are lost
We will seek the day

As we are lost
We will see the light

As we are lost
We will win the fight

As we are lost
We will continue on

As we are lost
The sunshine will be bright

As we are lost
The way shall be found

As we are lost
The road is ahead

As we are lost
The end is near

As we are lost
There is no need to fear

As we are lost
There will be new arms

As we are lost
There will be new friends

As we are lost"

"event","So yes, another entry for this place.
Sitting here at my internship company, what a great thing... Absolutely nothing to do this whole week. It was one big bullshit assignment after another for Edwin. I would be so glad if this idiotic period will be over. 
Just another month left and 3 weeks for a project for school than this year I will be having a vacation time of 4months! ""joy"". 

Have to get work set up in Eindhoven because shit, I won't be traveling between Etten-Leur and Eindhoven every damn week. 
Really don't know if I want to continue my work at AH, only thing good about it is the payments :). Don't think I will be getting alot more somewhere else. 

I am glad almost everything has been handled now with the house, gas, electricity, water, other stuff for the ""inboedel"". Just have to wait for KPN Digitenne and Orange ADSL. 

Tessa will be going into the house already next week. As for me I will follow 3weeks later. Bathroom is getting fixed tomorrow so thats another good thing. 
And finally a weekend without having to work in the house! yay! 
Finally time to get stuff for the house, we really still need to most stupid stuff like plates, glasses and so on. 

Yeah hopefully this house will bring alot of good things with it, just need to stay positive :)"

"event","Damn was just about to be a bit happy lately. But last week my cousin had surgery because he has testicleball cancer. So they did an operation and removed one ball. Now he had follow up checks to see if it didnt spread. Guess what it did spread so now he needs chemotherapy...

Way to go 2008!"

"event","Well as many of you know, I haven't been sitting still a lot the last half a year of my life.
New things coming in my life on a daily base it seems.

School has been mad busy with all kinds of stupid projects but I survived!
Haven't had much luck until last month the new year was kinda well starting off badly. 
Began with yet again losing some close friends well at least I considered them friends.
Couldn't understand what was so wrong with everything, but at some point it's better to let go. Haven't been around the net that much anymore since I started my internship. Just 4 more weeks of that and I am off having vacation for 4months lol.

A close friend of mine died in the beginning of this month, Evie was a great girl with which I had alof of good times. 2 years ago she moved to Ireland so I didn't see her that much sadly. She had a car accident and ended up dying in the hospital of her wounds. Something really broke inside of me, and an unfair life popped up in my head.
One week later I still was upset about it, stupid life. Why do good people go so soon. 

My mom is still not better, she probably shall never get better. But she's been having alot of problems with her handicap after the operation 1,5years ago. Makes me wonder how it came this way, after all this time she won't improve her visual/grip/concentration issues. 

But there has been a few good things too, luckily. 
First off me and Tessa got a house!! Yes that's right our own freaking house with a garden and everything. Good stuff :). Been working like crazy, painting, redoing the the wooden floor, and more!

Second of all I did a new photoshoot with Hedwig a great girl I met through myspace(so it's usefull after all, lol). I hope to have it up online when I am done with the house and things settle down around me. So keep your eyes open on my website www.vanierselfotografie.nl

Well that's it for about now. Expect me on here alot more in the future. 

Cheers!"

In the hope of getting in when we saw the band or anything. Lyn-z and Kitty were walking around town and we just explained what was the matter and they said ""we can put you on the guestlist if you want"". Damn was worth going freaking early! So we ended up getting in! 

Awesome show (pics coming soon).

But what I cant stand is that people act like they are your friends and when their with others they ignore you. I mean how can you do something like that, such a mystery to me.&nbsp;<br />Maybe it's just me, probably am to friendly about things. Weird how people can change just like that and still try to act normal to you later on (which of course I ain't buying). I so hate people like that!<br /><br />[/rumble off]<br /><br />But on the brighter side I am probably going to work with a photographer to get my own photography skills up :) so that are good things. </p>"

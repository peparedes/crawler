I don't want Justin to be sad. He's one of my best friends, but I can't help but be pissed off at what he's doing. He shouldn't expect me not to be with the person I really like because he likes me. That's not fair. I kind of wish that he would hate me, but I want him to be the kind of friend that lasts forever, and I'm worried that I've fucked that up.

.....I FOUND THE BATTERY CHARGER FOR MY VIDEO CAMERA!!!!! NOW, I can spend the $100 that my Mom gave me for my birthday on OTHER things.....

It all started when I looked up the price of a new battery charger online to find that it was $120. I replied,"" NO FUCKING WAY,"" and began my search in the living room. After about 5 minutes, I looked in this big basket whose contents are mostly my sister's to find it. I'll admit, I did a little dance....

Eh, the usual: Happy, but with no prominent reason, just everyday life. 

I visited my Grandad (Mom's side) last night. We watched the PGA Tour, Ford Championship to be exact.....it's a golf thing. It was so funny to listen to my 84 year old Grandfather saying,""Oh, Tiger, that was too strong....maybe you can make a bogey out of it."" Hehehe...my Grandad's so cute. Then, I went to my Grandma's (Dad's side) and we ate Chinese food, watched the Oscar's, and looked through old pictures. My first baby picture, the one at the hospital, looked so funny. I had a fauxhawk/Alfalfa hairdo. I also got to look at all my Dad's embarrassing school pictures...I say all because ALL of them are really funny looking...and a bunch of pictures of my Mom (she was sooooooooooooo pretty, still is, but back then....damn). AND I saw pictures from my parents' wedding and my baby shower for the first time ever.

I was talking with Justin yesterday about our lives. We were really appreciative at the time, and I still am. I have such an awesome life. Good friends, good family, and just good times.....But I was talking with Mike Shope today, and told him that the ONE thing that I would change would be that I would have a boyfriend, a GOOD one, that treats me right, and doesn't break my heart. WHY....love is like a drug, it can hurt you sooooooo much, but you would do pretty much anything to feel it. I DO feel love, but a different kind, and I want more of it.....

I AM really happy....I wish everyone was as happy as this girl right here, but there's no such thing as too happy.....

Sunday night, I dreamt that there was this guitar playing by itself in my room, and as soon as I went over to check it out, my shoes on the floor started talking to me, and said,"" You have been courageous in asking about the shawls."" When I asked what the fuck they were talking about, they said that I would soon know. Then later, I dreamt that I was having a conversation with a baby doll, but it didn't have a message for me. Then last night, I dreamt that Danny was crippled, but the only reason why was because he was using a walker. Like, the walker was the thing that was crippling him. I felt bad, but it was his own damn fault in the first place. Symbolism?? I think so.

For those of you who don't know, but care, Justin might be moving into a house out in the country, about fifteen minutes away. It's awesome. It has a fire pit, a garden, a field, woods, and we're gonna put a hammock on the porch, and build a tree house in the tree in his backyard. This spring's going to be so fun!

Danny broke up with me today. This Friday the Thirteenth actually did prove to be quite unlucky, for once. I don't think it'll be for long, though. He said he just needs time alone.

I think reading everyone's recent entries gave me a bit of advice that I used to live by, but kind of forgot. 

On another note, my Dad came home last night, and handed me the title to a car. It's a 1992 Volkswagon Cabriolet convertible. My Dad and others are pitching in to get it for me. He said he was going to just get it for me without telling me, but my Grandma said to ask first. SWEET!

I'm gonna miss my Mom, but still...I love you guys. I'm not as tan as I wanted to be....being an assistant for a photographer does indeed require me to be inside all the time. AND speaking of that photographer...she does all of these photos for this place called Wimberly Glass Works, and they sell jewelry. For their next catalogue, they wanted people to model the jewelry. So, yesterday, my Mom and I were doing what else, but modeling jewelry. SWEET. I'll bring pictures back.

When I get back, we're all gonna do some hardcore hanging out. WORD."

I went to a tattoo shop with Nick and others and watched him get his tattoo sort of finished....and I came up with really cool ideas for tattoos that I want to eventually get, with some help from Nick...he said that I should get crossed swords on my back, where I have dimples, so that it looks like the end of the blades actually pierce the skin...awesome...I think I'm gonna do it...

"event","Well, in order to have a sufficient update, I've decided to back-track a little, fo those of you who haven't know me for a long time...and for my own amusement...

We'll start with eighth grade:
Man, those were the days, Kelly, Steve, Ryan S., and me. We would skate everywhere in Lemoyne and play invisible football at coffee houses. We would pull mageivers (however the hell you spell that) and try to steal flags from the old folks' home. We would have a great time doing it too...and then, near the end of eighth grade, my stepmom cheated on my father and left home. I have to say, I don't think I have, or ever will feel as betrayed as I did then. I sent her letters and emails asking her why she left and got no response and came home only to adjust to living with half of the family I had. 

Then I came to highschool:
I met the most awesome people, those of you that are reading this are included, and have great friends. I went to shows pretty much all year, became friends with Steve again, and met Zac. I realize that I have a wonderful life, although filled with some bad things, like my now ex-stepmom, I reflect on the good and am totally happy. I just want to say,"" Thank you"" to everyone, and I really mean it.

I don't really have much to say anymore...until next time"

"event","Well I haven't updated in a while.. So here I go..

School have been pretty fun.. Finished my essay in English.. Everyone had to turn in their final draft on tuesday.. Thats about all I did on Tuesday regarding school..

Did some job hunting.. Everyone is telling me that I need to try and get my job back at the State School.. I dont know.. Still kinda debating..

Went to Keva Juice to see a friend of mine that worked there, but when I got there I found out that she quit.. Or I assume quit.. so yeah.. And the other one had already moved to SA.. But I got me a smoothie anyways..

After all that I had my choir rehearsal to go to.. I needed to go to this one since I didn't go to the last one.. So I was on my way home from my moms house and I was going to be late.. It started at 7:30 but it was already coming up on 8.. Anyways.. I go pick up Mandy later on and we head out to the rehearsal.. We get there and I am heart broken, lol.. They were singing my song.. O Isis Osiris.. Its an all male song.. Tenor I&II and Bass I&II, and I am a Bass II.. and thats the coolest thing to hear in that song.. The extremely low basses hit that low note.. And its cool cause I can sing that song perfectly.. But oh well.. We still have one more practice.. anyways.. After the rehearsal I Ronni came over to me and she goes, ""You got the goods?"" lol.. I had to discs she asked for and we just sat and talked the whole time practically.. It was cool.. Had cake afterwards because it was one of our members birthdays.. So that was pretty cool too.. 

So yeah.. then me and Mandy went on an an extended drive taking her home... Sang some Sinatra to her.. that was cool.. Had a good time doing that.. I have to work on two of the songs I sang to her.. but that last one I think I did pretty bad ass.. but anyways



Going to keep this one short.. I am starving so I am going to find something to eat.."

<b>QueensRyche: Silent Lucidity</b>

Hush now, don't you cry,
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye.
You're lying safe in bed,
It was all a bad dream spinning in your head.

Your mind tricked you to feel the pain,
Of someone close to you leaving the game (of life).
So here it is, another chance, wide awake you face the day.
The dream is over, or has it just begun....?

There's a place I like to hide,
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize, and you were scared.
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears
Retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind.

Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see this magic new dimension
I........will be watching over you
I........am gonna help to see you through
I........will protect you in the night
I........am smiling next to you
In silent lucidity

Visualise your dream,
Record it in the present tense,
Put it into a permanent form,
If you persist in all efforts,
You can achieve dream control...
...dream control...
...dream control...

::whispered:: (help me)

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see.
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down; a new world will begin.
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly.

A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize your dream's alive
You can be the guide, but...
I........will be watching over you
I........am gonna help to see you through
I........will protect you in the night
I........am smiling next to you


Classic song.. one of my favorites when I was young.. I love singing this song.. I think I can sound like the singer at least.."

"event","Man.. I make so many stupid mistakes you know? But what good does it do to dwell on them.. I have accepted the fact that I can't force people to tell me things.. I have accepted the fact that if I offer a ride to someone and they dont want it.. then dont bother asking again and again.. I did really good today.. I talked to a friend of mine on the phone today around 11 or 12.. Asked how their day was, how work went.. and then offered a ride home in the later day of friday.. which is now today.. and well even though that person said no.. I wasnt bothered by it.. and I didn't go and badger them about it.. And I felt really good about myself.. I hate how I learn things so late.. I should have learned these things along time ago.. One thing I did notice is that.. When I used to badger in the past.. It was always to that person over the internet.. So I never really got to see the expressions and annoyed face of that person.. I never go to see the disappointed look they had towards me.. It wasnt until the other night that I got to see in person the effects my badgering has on someone.. It was then that I felt like I let this person down.. It was then that I felt like I failed.. In a sense I did fail, but in a sense I didn't because I noticed my problem.. I saw it.. and now I am determined to get rid of it.. I can't stand it.. I want it no more.. I realize that saying and doing are two different things, but I have started the change.. and so far it has been successful.. Can't wait for people to see it.. I know its going to take some time.. But I will prove to everyone that I am capable of change, and that I can be someone to count on.. 

I have alot of explaining to do to a very dear friend of mine.. I have treated her so poorly over the past 2 days.. and alot of what I have been saying is coming out the wrong way.. I know what I want to say, but at times I just cant say it.. why? intimidated? I dont know if that is it exactly.. But when I spoke to her and tried to talk to her.. I know I wanted to hear her scold me more than I wanted to talk to her.. Cause I deserved it.. Sometimes I act as if I am flawless when I am really just as flawed as anyone else is.. Nobody is perfect, but lately I have been trying to get as close to perfect as I can, lol.. Always room for improvement.. But hopefully I get my chance to explain myself.. She will appreciate it greatly.. I know she will.. Sometimes I know it can be hard to tell if I am sincere or not, but this time she will definitely tell.. 

Because of all this, I have been really down and beating myself up.. Hence the title of this post.. I was born to sing the blues.. Sometimes things dont seem to go my way.. Sometimes I feel as if all my years and hard work on things were all for nothing.. Is that healthy? Probably not.. But is the feeling temporary? Yes.. and thats the good thing about it.. I dont sit there dwell on it for more than a day.. I quickly try to find the solution to my problem and work around it.. or in recent case, try and improve upon myself.. But anyways.. I better be going.. I need some sleep.. I have school tomorrow and I want to go.. I love school.. and I cant wait to become that Naval Officer.."

"event","I give up.. It seems like everytime I step out of the house I get into trouble.. literally.. no joke..

I wake up for my history class and I hop in the car to get to school.. Pull out of the driveway.. not paying attention to anything.. I was zoning about school, and I see this cop, and I am like oh crap.. slow down.. omg its still school zone.. and bam.. he pulls out.. small little u'ey and stops me.. great.. my house it right there and now I realize I have the wrong insurance card.. the right one is still in the envelope.. great.. so I get busted for going 30 and no insurance.. Do I even have the money for this ticket? grr..

That does it.. I give up.. I am not asking any questions anymore.. its final.. this is pissing me off.. it seems as if everyone is against me in this world when it comes to questions.. anyone else can ask questions but zeke, no.. they ask questions and get the answers they want but I get jack crap.. which pushes me to ask more.. and why I do this? I have no clue.. I know they hate it, but yet I insist on asking more and more.. It pisses me off.. did I inheirit this god aweful trait of mine? and if I did.. why me?.. I dont want to be this person anymore.. cause I am getting tired of people soley concentrating only on the bad side of Zeke.. as if all the good times that I shared with a person never existed.. Because of this questioning.. they look and find more faults to hate me for.. I dont want that anymore.. Its gone.. I have finally reached a snapping point.. Its taken me this long to actually really hate this about myself.. If I could beat the shit out of my self causing excrutiating pain and heal up within an hour, then I would.. that way I could feel the pain and be like.. alright.. this is what I get for doing these things.. Better yet.. I would have the people that I piss off beat the shit out of me..

I havent drawn a damn thing in a long time.. Why? Cause I am freaking lazy.. and that too is pissing me off.. I am so confused about things lately because people confuse the hell out of me.. I dont get a damn thing thats going on.. and no matter how many times I tell them otherwise.. they still dont believe me.. as if I am the only person in the world who cant change.. everyone else can, but Zeke.. no.. its impossible.. why do people even care about me if they hate me so much.. I dont understand.. I am grateful that they still have feelings for me, but when they are constantly hating me it bothers me.. I must admit though.. I am at fault for this damn questioning.. and this is exactly why I dont want to do it anymore.. The questioning is pointless.. I have no reason to.. If they want to tell me.. then thats fine.. If they dont want to tell me, then thats fine too.. Before I leave Texas.. I am going to prove to everyone that I can change.. That they are wrong about me.. That I can be trusted.. 

I am going to graduate from DelMar, attend a university with an nrotc program.. graduate from there.. and I will be commissioned into the Navy as an Officer.. I will also be a different man completely.. no more questioning.. have tons of self-motivation, confidence, and all that jazz.. I will succeed in this.."

"event","Today started out fine.. Went to class.. Got some gas.. Didn't expect a call from Mandy and guess what.. She didn't call.. After class when and played some pool with a friend of mine and franks.. After that we picked frank up and threw the ball around and ran some routes practicing our plays in case we do join the corpus christi flag football league.. 

7:00 rolled around and still no call from Mandy.. We were supposed to go to our rehearsal today.. she was looking forward to the solo audtitions.. I wanted to hear her sing.. Alot of people were asking about her.. It was so weird walking in there without her I'll tell you that.. As for signing, I sounded a lot better.. I went there on my own and sang on my own without her sitting across from me.. A sense of accomplishment? Maybe.. But I still would have loved to have seen her there.. to at least try out for a solo.. 

During my break, my dad called.. Talked to him for a bit after small chit chat with ronnie.. She told me I should try out for a solo since there not that many guys.. I would have.. but I still have some more learning to do regarding reading music and such.. 

After all the questions regarding Mandy, I began to wonder myself, so I decided to call her and see what she was up to.. I thought to myself.. well I hope she is at least making good use of this time to herself.. Like getting homework done or getting some sleep in.. But I was wrong.. She was going out with her ex Josh.. He decides to call out of the blue.. and now they are ""cool."" I asked if I could drop by after the rehearsal to talk.. I have some important issues concering me and her that I need to clear and get off my chest.. Just a quick 20-30 minute talk and I would be on my way.. Well she says they dont plan to be done until past midnight.. and that tomorrow would be a better idea.. I was kinda bothered by it.. But I cant do anything about it, so why have any ill feelings toward it.. Its uncalled for.. Useless..

Break is over, and back to singing I go.. I am kinda excited.. I love singing.. and I have always wanted to join one.. Sadly I never had the confidence within myself to tryout or even try to learn.. But that all changed when Mandy came along.. She really encouraged me.. as well as inspired me.. She is a beautiful singer.. He voice is so soothing.. Very angelic.. but anyways..

Midnight rolls around.. and I am beginning to think if they even went to the movies.. I had a feeling they didn't.. Wrong of me to be curious? Maybe, but I hate being lied too.. 

12:18PM: The Call..

Yeah.. the call was no good.. She said tomorrow.."

"event","I want so many things.. 

Like right now.. I want to say something.. Like, I feel like writing something.. but dont know what about.. I have so many things to say.. So many questions to be answered.. So many personal goals to acheive.. sigh..

Tonight I was told I always say something and base it off of something I read of off the internet, but never back it up with a fact.. and to myself.. I thought about it.. and I guess I kinda do that.. and then that person also said that when I do base it off of a fact, I never remember where I received that fact from thus killing the possibility of it being looked upon as a fact.. But the thing is.. Sometimes I just honest to god cannot remember where I retrieved that information from.. But this person is right though.. and they weren't trying to be mean.. They were subtly trying to suggest to cut down on it I guess, lol.. Yes it may be a weird way of trying to help, but everyone has their own method of helping and they are entitled to it.. and they are right.. How can I walk into an argument, or conversation, and expect to get anywhere in it when I have no valid facts? I can't.. simple as that.. so I need to work on that.. Slowly but surely I am trying to work on things.. Always room for improvement is something I keep in mind..

There are alot of things that I am not happy with about myself.. Things that I absolutely loathe and require immediate attention, and some things that are small but still would like to see some work done on it.. But for the most part.. They are all things that I absolutely loathe.. and even though the changes are small and may not be apparent right now, I am honestly working on them.. and eventually (hopefully sometime soon) the changes will be noticable.. 

Another thing... I believe optimism should be a part of everyones life.. I mean.. what good is it to think so negative about everything every day of your life? It only causes uneeded stress and self-confidence issues.. and how does that help? But people that I know seem to believe that it is a very vital part of life and a damn good characteristic.. Very helpful and keeps them out of trouble and danger.. I on the other hand.. well.. I believe that to an extent.. But not entirely.. Depends on the situation.. SO I apologize to the people that I have tried to force optimism on.. 

One thing that I have noticed about myself and that people have made apparent to me on countless occasions(and is something that I am working on) is that I continue to ask what what and well what.. and when I get that reply.. nothing.. I continue to bagger.. I sit there and ask what and they sontinue to say if I dont want to tell you then I dont want to tell you.. Which is reasonable and is something I must respect and I have been until recently.. the bad thing is is that I have this history and the one time I ask after such a long absence they go off.. but they do have good reason to.. they have warned me before.. Its just sometimes I dont catch myself doing it.. But it doesnt help when sometimes thats all they seem to do is think about something that is bothering them or what not and when I ask they dont want to talk about it and continue to think on it and then get upset if I dont talk or I seem reserved or what not.. I mean why think about it in front of me if you arent going to talk about it and then get upset or say well I wish he would be more ""uppity"".. I mean how can I do that when I cant get their attention in the first place because they are bothered about something.. This goes back to the whole chance thing in a way.. I mean I cant prove myself when everyone I am around.. and I dont mean just one person.. but friends that I care about seem to have so many things on their mind but dont want to talk about it thus ceasing my chance of proving that I can be entertaining.. and another thing.. I am not the only person with them.. I mean.. why should I always be the one to initiate a conversation.. I am not the only person in that room.. You can talk to me about anything and I can make a conversation happen.. many things interest me.. I am very versatile in many subjects.. from music, to sports, etc.. etc.. and when I suggest a conversation starter.. just talk.. I am not some serious tense robot.. give me a shot.. lemme show my potential.. I mean yesterday.. I had a really good time with a very good dear person to me.. and normally.. for the most part it would be quiet.. or we would just have the radio going and start singing to kill the silence.. but this time.. we had fun.. a bit of harmless arguing.. conversation.. one incident of me asking ""what this"" but that was it.. and for the most part it was a really cool day.. to me.. I had fun.. to the other person.. I dont know because they havent given me any input on it.. except for that the arguing was ""sorta"" fun, but I am sure that this person enjoyed it for the most part.. but the only reason as to why the conversation had a spark and a chance to continue was because that other person wasnt constantly thinking to theirselves.. which made it a whole lot easier for both of us to be ourselves.. and afterwards It was really fun.. and I enjoyed it.. and the reason as to why that was possible was because both parties werent thinking to themselves about some problem that they didnt want to discuss.. but anyways.. enough about this.. for all I know.. I could be digging my own grave.. and if I already have been.. then I am freaking deep.. but if only people could see the real me..

Art.. Up until I now I havent been taking advantage of a talent that I possess.. Drawing.. I loved to draw.. but I stopped a while back.. and recently.. with the help of someone really special to me.. helped me get back into drawing.. and now.. I regret ever quiting.. Lately, the urges to draw have been stronger than ever.. and this person really sees the potential in me.. and continues to provide encouragement and constructive critism, helping me to do better and improve.. I owe this person alot.. I have also made this person false promises regarding that I intend to fix.. I must admit though.. I do draw alot because and for this person, but I also draw for myself.. I also draw because of my undying love for art.. But I can't leave out my mother.. she too when we lived in florida showed an interest in my artwork.. so I have my thanks to her as well.. But I dont plan on quiting drawing anymore.. I can't give up on it.. I can only get better at it.. 

""Freud considered this complex the cornerstone of the superego and the nucleus of all human relationships. Many psychiatrists, while acknowledging the significance of the Oedipal relationships to personality development in our culture, ascribe love and attraction toward one parent and hatred and antagonism toward the other not necessarily to sexual rivalry but to resentment of parental authoritarian power.""
I went back to the source of my information and how it was used to refresh my memory and back up my earlier statement, not to prove ""you"" wrong, but to give you a better understanding of why I thought of it the way I did.. When I heard this used, the psychiatrist gave his client this quote, but not to suggest that he wanted to take advantage of his mother sexualy, but rather he wanted to kill his father to gain power over the family and his dramatically distraught mother and to receive the family fortune his father had plans to bestow to him.. Now I wasnt implying that you were wrong and didnt know the oedipal complex because god knows I know you know.. I was just trying to give you an idea of the many ways that the oedipal complex can be used from a psychological standpoint.. Now I know it may have just been a movie, but I still think that one could use the oedipal complex this way.. But you are right.. and I know I may have made it seem as if I had that mentality as if I knew everything and I was ultimately right, but that was in no way my intention.. and I apologize.. yea yea yea.. just let it go zeke I know.. I just wanted to clear it up.. beat me up for it later.. or find something to throw at me again, lol..

I dont view my posts as complaining.. but subtle hints hoping that friendS will read my posts with an open mind and maybe work with me on these areas.. hoping that they will see the real me proving that I can be entertaining.. yes some may say, hey.. if you are having this much trouble with your current friends, then find new ones.. but I dont want to.. I do have my moments with my friends, I just wish it wouldnt be one moment every so often.."

"event","Alright so I have been wanting to post for a while.. But I havent really had anything to post about..

Well I have found something to cover here on LJ.. I have thought of a couple actually, but only one simple one for now.. 

Now I know its a bit early for New Years Resolutions to be posted, but frankly.. I dont care.. 

Lately I have taken into consideration the things that I see are bad traits that I possess.. These are traits that I am willing to go great lengths to change.. For the past few months I have been at work trying to rid myself of the Analytical, Over-critical, Interrogative characteristic that I possess(ed)..
So far so good as I find that for the most part it is gone.. I do admit that It may not be entirely gone, but I am still working on it.. That is one that I really really despise and I am very adamant on changing about myself.. But aside from that.. I have also noticed that I am a very serious guy.. At first I thought it was a good characteristic of mine, signifying maturity and intelligence, but there is a time to be serious, and time to just go out and have fun.. And I dont want people to feel that everytime they are around me that they have to be serious or they just wont meet up to my standards or expectations.. I want them to be theirselves around me and not feel stupid everytime they do something or be themselves.. Cause I dont think that.. I dont sit there and be judgmental over something they do.. I will more than likely laugh with them or laugh at their jokes, but I would never sit there and be like.. What that hell are you doing..? I would never do that.. I just hate coming off as a guy who is judgemental and extremely serious.. But that is one thing I want to change about myself.. Another one, that is also something I am currently working on, is to have an opinion of my own... a decision maker.. who wont constantly ask others to make the decision because that bores people.. It also gets tiresome for them.. and lately I have been working on it.. even though it hasnt been so apparent to some, I have been working on it.. but thats another resolution(goal) that I have set for myself.. but as of now.. ( i say as of now because I am hella freaking tired) that is all that I can think of..  but anyways..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I also want to apologize earlier to someone who was having a serious problem but I couldnt think of anything to say.. I am sorry.. never been faced with a situation like that so I didnt quite know what to say.. I mean there was one instance where I was put through something like that, but my mom was also there to comfort me so it wasnt all that bad.. but anyways.. I am better at comforting for a situation like that in person rather than on phone.. and I also had a few things going on at the same time of your call so I was pretty distracted.. Grandma had me doing things, a friend was coming over, I had to talk to little about the seating arrangements on the way to florida.. also the packing and turns driving on the way up there.. Today was a fairly busy day for me when I woke up.. But I just wanted to say I was sorry for not being so comforting.. I just had alot on my mind as well but I didnt want to tell you that over the phone and have you suggest we hang up because I wanted to try my best regardless of the fact that I was overwhelmed with other problems as well.. You seemed to be really bothered and i felt really bad for you so I wanted to lend an ear/mind so you could get things off your chest.. But for your information, I think you handled it rather well.. Your siblings look at you as their leader in time of need and you handlled it nicely.. You took the position of commander in your family and got things done and also lending a sense of comfort and optimism to your younger siblings as well letting them know that things were going to be okay.. I commend you on that.. You arent as weak as you think you are.. You are pretty damn strong.. remember that.. But for now I am going to go because I am pretty tired.. I will talk to you later.. You have my number in case you want to talk about things.. Hopefully I wont be so overloaded with problems that way I can listen and provide comfort and intellectual insight.. well.. I will talk to you later.. goodnight and sweet dreams..

and to everyone else.. goodnight and happy holidays.."

I hate the people who make other people's lives a living hell for the sheer pleasure of it making them feel guilty for everything that has gone wrong in their life.. It's like making them feel guilty gives them a sense of pide and accomplishment.. and they do it because they know they are an influence.. they know they can manipulate their easy to crack minds and make them do whatever they want them to do.. If they were to tell that person to jump up and down with their pants off they would do it..

This pisses me off because this is all they do.. Intentionally make others lives a living hell just to make them feel guilty about it.. and most of the time.. the true victim has nothing to be guilty for.. But when the attacker constantly makes them feel guilty, the victim begins to surrender and feel as if they are wrong and always were wrong.. so thats all the victim has to go on.. Could it also be the victims fault for not strengthening themselves and realizing how much of a bitch those people really are? Well yes I guess it could be their fault for allowing them to succumb to their childish games.. 

grrrrrr.....

So I get mad and had the mentality ""Well if he needs my help he is still going to have to ask."" But when he does ask he yells at me saying you need to get out there and help them.. and I am like wtf!? But whatever.. My grandma talked to him amd told he what happened and he apologized and we talked about things ans what not.. I mean I wanted him to ask me.. Last summer he needed help with his van and asked me.. hey you wanna help me out.. I could use your help.. and I was like sure.. and we got it done together.. what would have been a 1+ hour job by himself turned out to be a 30 minute job.. and it was cool.. I felt good about working on something with him and getting it done together.. and I was hoping it would have been like the same way this time.. but no.. Overall my trip here to Florida has been okay so far.. Today we went out to the Naval Aviation Museum.. Checked out one of the Forts out here.. then we went out to eat.. As for yesterday, Thanksgiving, it was cool.. I was showing off my expert marksmanship to my uncle and mom's bf at grandparents house.. I was using a bb gun with really shitty range and I bet them that in three shots I can hit the target from 20+ feet away.. mind you now after 10 feet the BB drops straight to the ground.. so after one shot I knew exactly what I had to do.. I had to raise the site on the rifle.. and then I had to aim above the target.. and sure enough.. I did hit it.. It only took me 2 shots.. but anyways.. That may not seem interesting to you guys but to me I thought it was rather interesting.. an accomplishment.. to know that that is a one of the skills I posess that will always stick with me.. But moving on.. After that we headed back to my fathers house for his Thanksgiving and man the turkey was delicious.. It was ambrosial, lol.. It was so freaking good.. The only thing that was bad was that Lina forgot to make the mashed potatoes, lol.. how do you forget the mashed potatoes, lol..  but it was cool.. she has her neices here and they made it for us.. they didnt mind so it was cool.. but we thanked them for it and yeah.. but yeah.. I better get going.. Dad rented some movies so I am going to go watch them.. later.."

"event","Well life is actually pretty good I guess... 

My life right now consists of three things.. well maybe 4.. anyways... those four things are as follows:

1.School
2.Work
3.Family
4.Friends

As for school... its awesome.. I love it.. My passion for school has increased dramatically.. I would definitely have to say English is my favorite subject hands down.. I have 3 teachers all of whom are saying that I should make my major english.. The thought of that has become rather tempting and a degree english can take you a long way.. into many different fields.. Math.. ehhhh.. still a subject I would rather avoid, but can't.. taking this class is inevitable.. theres just no way of getting around.. unless I challenged the course but yeah.. not good in math.. I have met alot of people at school.. but I get the feeling in english that I am being used, lol.. I am not saying I am the best at english.. but I am pretty darn good.. all of my essays have been high A's.. but anyways.. yeah school = awesome.. 

As for work.. yeah.. we all know work is work.. but it has been cool lately.. behaviors havent been too much of a concern lately.. the only recent one was when a client tried to UD ( Unauthorized Departure ) to pica ( ingestion of foreign objects ) on cigarette butts... and this guy is a big guy... he isnt something to underestimate.. he is strong.. took 3 of us to take him down.. the guy who had his arms couldnt hold him.. so I was the back up.. and we had to take this guy down on the concrete.. so anyways... one of the clients arms got free of the staff who had his upper body.. so I grabbed that arm and tried to slip it under his body to complete the restrain.. and while you are restraining someone.. you dont think of the pain associated with it.. well we I yelled at the other staff to go and get the transport jacket so we can get it on him and take him inside... *a transport jacket is like a straight jacket except without sleeves..* so we get him in that and take him to the back.. they informed that I had dining.. so I go in there.. put sanitizer on my hands and then I realized that I was wounded cause it stung like a mofo.. I looked at my left hand and noticed that it was bloody.. I scraped up the top of my left hand on the concrete pretty bad.. and my wrist took a beating too.. the other staff also had wounds to his knuckles.. and the client had a huge freaking scratch on his left forearm.. lol.. I went outside where the restraint had taken place after dining was over.. and there was blood all over the concrete in all sorts of directions, lol.. I looked on my pants and I go.. ""whos blood is this"" the whole time I was chuckling.. and I have no idea.. It was just a rush.. I had fun.. I bet the client was pissed though.. he wanted those cigarette butts bad.. he was stronger than usual.. but I cant allow it.. his program doesnt allow it.. smoking is a bad habit and should never be taken up.. sigh... anyways..

Now.. as for my family.. My grandfather on my mother's side is hospitalized.. he has cancer.. and the doctor said that this could be the end of him.. I really dont know how to react.. right now it doesnt effect me.. but I sure hope it does as more word gets to us.. I guess right now since its only a ""could"" and not a ""for sure"" could be reason as to why I am not showing any sadness.. I really hope this isnt the end of him.. I would really love to enjoy some more time with him.. He is a real good guy.. taught me how to shoot.. taught me how to fish.. basically taught me everything there is to know about the country side.. what animals to watch out for.. what insects to kill.. all sorts of stuff.. hmm.. I really hope he has more time..

My friends.. what the hell would I do without them.. I dont have many close friends.. but I am very thankful for the ones that I do have.. I have become closer to some of them.. and distant to others.. Me and Chris are starting to play pool again.. I am definitely.. I have gotten real good since I last played.. thats one thing I have noticed about myself.. If I play something for a long time.. then take a long ass break from it.. then go right back into it.. I get all that I knew about it back but with more skill.. and thats what happened this time.. I am extremely better than what I was.. and i love the sport and i hope to own my own table soon.. my friends at work are cool.. I have become closer to some.. my friend James is one of my best friends there.. same with my friend chennelle.. shes probably the coolest staff there.. shes the one I go out partying with.. last time me, her and the dorm went out ot Rack Daddys for Battle Of The Bands which was bad ass.. hmm.. thats all I really have to say on this subject..

Hmm.. yeah so.. about my love life.... aint got one.. nope... nada.. its kinda sad.. I do wish I still had that special someone to cuddle up with and watch a movie.. or go out to a movie or get a bite to eat at a resturaunt.. or to even just take a late night ride out to the beach or something.. just to chill.. but.. I have nothing yet.. am I looking? I have no idea.. have had a few interested girls in my life.. but never made a move.. why? I have no idea, lol.. but its all cool I guess..

The one thing I wish I could do the most right now would be to take a nice long vacation.. and for some reason I am thinking florida.. just to go out there.. enjoy the countryside for a bit.. go fishing.. to just relax.. get away from corpus for a bit.. well actually.. I cant say that would be the thing I wish for the most right now.. the thing I wish for the most would to be to just have the luxory of quiting my job abd going to school full time with a nice flexible partime job.. thats what I want.. both of those would allow me to have time to myself as well.. go fishing out on the island.. play pool whenever I wanted.. draw (which has been something that I have been dying to do for a long ass time) I dont know.. I really wish I could do that right now.. but I cant.. I dont see it as a possiblilty yet.. I probably just need to give it more thought and find a way that I could do that... well.. anyways.. I better be going.. I have class in about 5 hours.. so I gtg.. later"

"event","Well July 17th is my birthday.. and well I got a Happy 21st birthday from most of the people I know.. with the exception of..

my mother..

Today sucked cause I had to work on my bday.. from 2:00 to 10:30pm.. how fun.. actually it wasn't that bad.. It didn't hit me until I got off of work.. thats when I.. I guess felt alone.. that my birthday wasn't really a birthday at all.. It didn't feel like a birthday.. I dont even feel 21.. I am also having a lot of family problems and that also kinda played a role in today.. I go homw.. grandma asked me about today.. if anyone wished me happy birthday... and I told her who all said it.. then my dad called me cause he called me earlier to wish it and He also asked who told me it.. and i told him my mom didn't.. he found that kinda weird.. it wasn't one of those angry with mom tones of voice either.. he really found it weird cause he said she is good with the birthdays.. which she is.. but yeah.. anyways.. so I go home thinking.. well I will just call some people.. see if they dont mind me coming over or if hey want to go out.. and well.. everyone I called were going to sleep.. thats when I started feeling alone.. I have no special someone to spend it with, family can't cause of problems.. friends cant because they are sleeping getting ready for tomorrow and or just tired in general.. I mean.. this isn't how a 21st birthday is supposed to be right? I dont know, maybe I am just being stupid.. I am just really bummed.. I just feel as if my whole birthday was a waste.. I only turn 21 once you know.. I didn't even get a call from my mother.. and I guess it sorta bothers me.. 

There is just alot going on right now.. and honestly.. I kinda sorta just feel like giving up.. and to all who know me.. they know me to be the person who never gives up.. Family doesnt feel like a family anymore.. my mom was kicked out and now I dont even know where she is living.. she doesn't tell me.. grandma thinking about selling the house and she is either going to move to florida or get an apartment here and I will have to find somewhere to live.. my job alone wont get me an apartment as long as I have my car because the insurance is so high considering I am under 25.. I dont know.. just so many things going on in my head right now.. Tomorrow I am off but what can I do.. nothing.. just spend another day by myself.. wow I am really negative right now.. I guess when I sleep it will all go away.. my mood changes when I wake up.. some peoples stay but mine goes away.. I know that my mood now is just temporary.. grr.. I am just rambling now.. well.. I better get going.. I am on a friends comp and was told I can't stay too long.. I feel bad because I feel as if I am a problem by being here.. Well I better get going.. I will post some other time.. I just needed to vent I guess.."

...deceased

...on June 19, 1986

...Fathers day...

...my grandfather..

Out of my other siblings.. I was the only child to see him.. I attended the beginning of the funeral.. but they kicked me and my mom out cause we were crying so much.. I was only a year or two old.. According to my grandma I was his favorite.. and we hung around each other so much.. he called me pumpkin, lol.. dont know why.. but he did.. I have a very faint memory of him.. just one repeating visual.. but only for a split second.. my grandma said after he died she passed by my room and I was sitting on the floor looking up towards the bed talking.. and she says she could feel my grandfather there.. as if I was talking to him.. hmm.. I miss him.. I have so many questions for him.. I bet if he were alive we would definitely not have any of these problems.. He would set everyone in line.. 

...wish you were here... I really do...

"event","Alright so I decided to start my post with a quote from the movie KillBill as you see from my subject title.. I love Kill Bill.. even though I haven't seen it in ages.. anyways..

So yeah yesterday at work was cool and kinda boring.. up until the part where I got attacked.. yeah! I got attacked.. im not lying.. why the hell would I lie about that, lol.. I guess it was kinda cool.. I needed to wake up anyways.. but still.. It kinda hurt afterwards.. alright so heres how it goes..

So I am just sitting there with a SRT for one of our clients.. and well everything was cool and all.. we were just watching TV.. and then one of our clients, who on a regular basis is loud and obnoxious and tends to get agressive with other indivudals, busts in from the back and is yelling, cussing, laughing, and just really hyper overall walking all over the place bumping into things and then he manages to hit one of our clients who has the worst anger problem and well.. he decided he wanted payback.. so we sat down the client who was being loud and obnoxious and then the one he hit through down his safety helmet and pacing back and forth getting ready to beat the others ass.. so me being a staff I have to intervene.. I can't just let him beat the hell out of another client.. he had already hit him once as it was, but that just wasn't enough for him.. so me having to intervene.. I jumped in his way numerous times.. and this guys has never had any quarrel with me before.. hes liked me.. I am one of the few staff that he likes.. well he kept telling me to move but I cant.. not supposed to.. and I tried to explain that to him.. but he finally had enough of me and started swinging at me.. so while he is swinging I can't do anything until my SPEC tells me what to do, because clients have certain restraint protocals.. and well while I am waiting for her to get back to me I could only stand there and take his hits.. well none of them hurt to terribly bad and I only sustained minimal bruising from the punches.. but then she gave me the word.. but the thing was.. we can't restrain him.. we can only redirect him.. so as I was doing that he was trying to turn around but I wouldn't let him, but finally he managed to do so and he started swining again.. well now I had enough.. he had already got me all worked up.. I didn't hit him.. as much as I wanted to knock him the hell out.. I didn't.. so I just held his arms.. and he was trying to get out of the hold I had him in but he couldn't, lol.. He was just swirming around like a little worm, lol.. it was kinda funny.. and while I was holding him he managed to scratch me twice to my lower left bicep.. and twice above my right bicep.. and those hurt.. stung like no ones business.. minimal bleeding on those.. and then he tried to spit in my face.. thankfully he only spit air.. I dont even want to imagine a big wad of spit in my face from him.. well finally backup came from the back cause he flopped to the floor.. so Valerie came and lifted his legs while I lifted his arms.. unfortunately I didn't have a good enough grip so I couldn't lift him very high.. and I didn't want to try and get a better grip cause then he would be able to swing again.. so we just toted him to his room dropped him and ran.. that was the original plan.. when we get to his bed we let go of him and i started to run but he grabbed my pants and nearly took my pants off.. now I am about to be naked cause of this guy.. we managed to get him off of me but now he is mad at me.. he was trying to bust down the door just to get to me.. and the only way to stop him is to wait him out and thats what we did.. finally he calmed down.. but he was still mad at me.. waiting for me to say anything to him just so he could say that he was annoyed with me and that he wanted to fight now.. all because I was defending another client he decided to fight me.. we tried to make him understand but it didn't work.. but yeah.. little guy got me a couple of times.. my muscles were all tence.. body was waiting to calm down.. I had to step out to calm down.. unfortunately I had to take the loud and obnoxious client with me, lol.. but it was cool.. 

Well today at work.. he was still mad at me.. thankfully I got pulled to another unit so I didn't to work around him.. and tomorrow I have off so that gives him another day to calm down, lol.. So hopefully he calms down.. if not then we are going to have a fun week with him.. Well I am going to go.. enough posting for today.."

"event","Grr man.. Lately I have been having a lot of wants.. Things such as my own home, well paying job, I want to buy houses and fix them up to sell them for more than they were originally worth.. I want a little girl.. I want to get in college and get it over with but enjoy it as well.. I want a few cars.. I want a boat.. I want to be able to travel whenever I please.. I want a getaway house on a beach with picket fences and a little deck leading to the sand.. I want to buy some little place and convert it into an art studio.. I want a family.. I want a wife with the same interests as I do.. who is passionate about work and family.. who would love 2 kids with all her heart.. a woman who I wont argue with, but I think arguments would sometimes be needed but I would want to have that argument and be able to be cool with one another afterwards.. I would want her to have an interest in my artwork.. provide encouragement for me just as I would her.. I would just like to have a happy family overall.. I would want to be able to take my kids anywhere they would like during the summers when they are not in school.. I love Walt Disney World so that is one place I would definitely take them too.. Sea World, Aquariums around the nation.. I would want them to have a passion for school for school will be a big part of their lives for a long time.. I would want to spoil them to an extent.. Umm lets see what else... for a house I would like a good sized house.. comfortable.. with an in ground pool and spa.. BBQ pitt a must, lol.. I want a library.. yeah even though I dont read much but I would definitely like a library.. I want our room to be spacious.. with a huge view and a balcony.. I would want Corinthean columns in the front of my house.. (To learn a little of Ancient Architecture, in this case columns, go here for more information such as dates examples and order from least decorative to most decorative, http://www.cmhpf.org/kids/dictionary/ClassicalOrders.html )  I want a fountain in my courtyard.. hmm.. there are so many aren't they, lol.. lets see.. oh I want to be able to afford my kids cars as graduation gifts from highschool.. I just want my family to have a really good comfortable life.. There are just so many wants that I can't just list them all.. and the wants are in no specific order.. there is no greater want for a certain one.. I just want them.. and I will acheive most of them.. I will..

All these are things that I have been thinking of lately.. just randomly out of nowhere.. ok no not really random.. but I mean.. I have thought of these things before.. but now I feel way more strongly about them than I used to.. I mean.. I dont think anyone out there really understands just how much I want to go back to school.. I took this break and I really hate it.. I mean sure alot of people say out of high school that I just want to take a break from it, but you may not like it.. in fact a majority of students out there who take breaks really end up regretting that they did.. because some of them dont go back.. and some of them struggle when they do go back.. but yeah.. I just really want to go back.. I want to get my Psychology degree.. ph.D and what not.. again here I go with the wants, lol.. better stop before I go on.. but yeah.. I was granted Financial Aide and I will be recieving $1,898 for this semester.. that should be plenty enough for my classes and I should have some extra money left over to play with.. buy me some clothes, or attempt some of the other ideas I had in mind, oh complete my computer for school.. can't wait for that.. this computer is going to be so awesome.. godlike in a way.. better than a dell, cheaper than a dell.. take that you profiteering gluttons! sigh..

Yeah lately it has been a bit rough.. been short on money but after this paycheck I should be back on track.. bills and what not got me this time because there were some things not bill related that I had to take care of such as my car.. my car desperately needed a tune-up, felt real sluggish and at times really nonresponsive and it began to freak me out and it was something that had to be done or else I would have been stuck without transportation.. and I had owed Lina some money and I had to pay her back.. she gave me some money for a calling card a while back and I needed to pay her back.. I promised her I would.. I also wanted to take the family to see StarWars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.. John and Catherine wanted to see it really bad and I know Dad and Lina and her daughter did too so yeah.. I took them out.. but yeah.. as of right now I have one dollar and fifty one cents in my account, lmao.. after this paycheck I should have about 129 left over from 560.. so yeah.. I will be getting back on track.. thankgod.. umm.. I have plans to build my grandma a deck soon.. this summer.. me and a friend from work are going to research up on it.. I am going to buy the materials.. and we are going to build it.. and I am going to have fun.. lately I have been in the mood to do some remodeling.. I have never had the passion for labor work but lately I have really wanted to do something like that.. I told grandma that I wanted too.. but I dont think she believes me.. but I swear on it.. all this talk about a possible deck all these years and now I want to give a whack at it.. aside from the money problems again the inevitable family problems arose.. god I hate family problems.. all my life I have hated them.. I really wish that my mom and father had stayed together.. If they had, then we would have not had so many problems as we do now.. I have made friends since I moved here.. and I have lost many of them for stupid reasons.. people are envious of me for whatever reason and some people just can't make decisions on their own like a couple of my friends who were friends with the one who stopped the communication so like bugs to bright lights they followed their lead and well yeah.. lost them too.. one of my best friend while I was in highschool moved to maryland because his father is in the navy.. he was the only one with a brain I tell you.. he knew what was right and what was wrong.. he wasn't the stupid one to follow the crowd.. he saw that my former friends were being extremely ignorant and the others just followed them and he stayed by my side.. good friend.. he made decisions on his own.. and hes in college now.. maybe one day we will see each other again.. we talk through email every now and then.. I really should email him again.. but anyways.. a part from those friends I had made two others that I graduated with.. and well I hung out with them alot.. they helped me through or at least tried to help me through extremely tough times and they were very understanding.. they looked into what was going on and saw that it was wrong and just as I was they were confused, lol.. and I apologize for bring yall into my life, lol.. but as I hung out with them I became really close to their families.. and I loved their parents to death.. and they had something I didn't.. something I would never have again.. two parents that remained together.. and they were happy.. man their whole family were together.. always laughing, always getting along.. going out occasionally.. and I became a part of their family.. something I wanted.. something I dont have with my own..and I do feel kinda wrong about that.. I mean of course I like the feel of it when I am at their houses but I will never consider them a replacement for my family.. I love my family.. I do.. but sometimes it just seems awkward between us.. I come home and some of them are awake and we dont even speak.. its just hi zeke and they go back to watching tv.. and its just not the same anymore.. and I miss it.. I often wish we had never left corpus from the begining.. we didn't have problems while we were here.. I never heard arguements.. our family was close to our cousins and uncles, aunts around the area.. now my grandma can't stand to see her sister.. we aren't close to our cousins anymore.. we dont have family get togethers anymore.. I just kinda.. sucks.. If my grandpa were still alive.. I dont think any of this would be like it is now..

but yeah.. that pretty much sums up my life lately.. as for today.. you know.. let me vent about this for a second.. I mean I am not mad about it.. I was for a little bit, but not anymore.. but anyways.. recently I had made the decision to take jessica and jenas little bro fishing.. ever since I told him about me going fishing he had wanted to go so badly.. and well I told him that I wanted to take him out.. and he got really excited.. well I told him hopefully monday we can go.. but when I came over the night before I told him no I wont be able to and he got really upset.. as if I let him down or something.. and thats how I felt.. and I felt really bad about it.. so I told myself that I was going to make it up to him.. so I promised him saturday.. and by taking him would me alot to me.. I wanted to teach him everything I knew about it.. cause he had never fished this way before.. so I was excited to teach him.. well Jess wanted to go.. and I said alright well you can go.. I mean its just Jess.. his sister.. and I am pretty sure she will be curious enough to try and fish.. so I thought what the hell.. but jena didn't want to go and jess didn't want to go by herself.. but jena had already made up her mind and jess left it at might go.. and I am like ok.. if she doesn't want to go she doesn't have to.. well the night before she told me she wanted to.. and now we had Jammie going.. and well I was like ok.. and then I get a call in the morning from jess saying hey we still going and i said yeah sure.. just let me get dressed and everything and she said ok oh and by the way.. mark and joel want to come to is that ok.. and i am like whoa.. wait a sec.. I planned this for me and justin.. i said that to myself.. and I flat out said no.. and she got upset and said why not, justin wants them to go and then I got sorta upset because now.. I mean.. hes not even going to want to fish.. I wont be able to teach him anything because I had a limited budget and only bought stuff to bottom fish with.. its not something that you can just rely on a cork/bobber/floater what have you.. it takes a little more effort and attention to bring a fish in.. I wouldnt be able to give all my attention to him because now we have these other guys there who he is just going to play around with.. and then i thought.. something is fishy here.. something is up.. so I just said you know what.. its your call jess.. you want them to come along.. its up to you and your brother.. I will call you when I am ready.. and well I did and they didn't change their mind and they ended up coming along anyways.. and you know what.. I hate being lied to.. I really do.. Me and her bro got down to buy the bait when he says.. are you mad cause they came.. and I said hey be honest with me here.. did you really want those guys to come.. and he said well jessica wanted them to come and I thought the only way you would take me was if she came.. and I was I dont know.. indescribable.. I was upset.. cause I planned this whole thing for him and he thought I wouldn't take him because Jess wouldn't go with out them and I wouldn't go without Jess.. I planned this thing for him, not jess and everyone else.. it just meant so much to me to take him out that I got upset.. cause I knew how much he wanted to go out.. and the boy doesn't get to go out much either.. and yeah.. and sure enough.. when we got there things were going okay at first but then he got distracted by them and started playing around with them that I just ended up fishing by myself.. I did however ended up teaching jess how to cast and well fish.. I think the only guy that I didn't mind all that much was joel.. at least he got out there and tried to fish other than sitting down trying to look all hard and pretty.. and at least he talked.. he seemed pretty cool overall I guess.. but yeah.. thats why I was upset about that.. but I am not upset anymore.. There is always next time.. and next time I will have more money..

What else happened today.. after I left Jess's house I went to Chris's but he wasn't there.. as tired as I was I didn't want to waste my day sleeping.. so I thought of some other things I could do.. and then I thought of Cassandra.. recently she had a birthday.. and she invited me to the clubs on her birthday.. but I didn't go.. I couldn't.. no money and afterwork I just want to chill.. I mean I will go out but as long as I am just driving or doing something that doesn't require alot of physical work.. and well instead of going out with Cassandra I hung out with Jess and Jena.. and I mentioned to them about her birthday and right after I told them about it, I heard her shoutout on the radio from Z95.. well anyways.. since then I have been trying to get a hold of her to apologize.. and well today I thought I would drop by her work and say hello.. well I ended up staying there for like 2 hours talking to her while she stocked items.. then we went to eat on her break.. after we ate she told me to drop by her house at 6 so we could go to the mall.. she had to buy her a skirt for church so I was like alright.. whatever.. so I go home and I fall asleep, lol.. but I manage to wake up in time to get to her house.. she asked me what took so long, lol.. I arrived at her house 30 minutes late, lol.. but we went to the mall and we had fun.. and she told me to give her a call tomorrow if I can.. I dont know if I will.. I have plans to wash my car tomorrow.. attempt to clean my room and a little bit of the house.. and what not.. I think I may just have a little bit of alone time.. not sure yet.. unless something is offered that will get me to go out.. but yeah.. 

Well this is indeed a lenghty post lol.. but I think its interesting to say the least.. well I better get going.. I have plans tomorrow.."

"event","confused again I am..

its been weird lately.. I mean.. its all revolved around Mandie lately.. and I am just so confused..

Lately I have been getting really nervous like pressure on the chest nervous at certain times of the day and Mandie pops in my head as if something is trying to tell me something.. I mean I can think about Mandie whenever I want and I wont get that pressure on my chest but sometimes I wont be thinking about her at all and all of a sudden the chest pressure comes and im thinking about her.. and I would call her and the pressure would go away.. hmm.. i dont know.. shes been pretty busy lately.. she went to scottys grad party.. and I could have gone.. I should have gone.. Selena asked me to go.. I honestly dont know why I didn't.. I felt kinda bad because he came to my little get together.. the least I could do was go to his.. but yeah.. I hope I worded that the way it was meant to be worded..

oh and I will dream and these aren't the ordinary usual dreams.. I mean usually I will just dream about something that happened that day or not dream at all.. but lately I have been dreaming about mandie.. well not just about mandie.. I mean in my dream.. well like last night.. all I was doing was fixing my computer in my dream but mandie was right beside me watching me and her mom comes in asking me what kinda of motherboard I have in it and then I am going to pick up mandie at school with my computer i dont know why I have my comp.. and.. what else.. I was at the beach and I am just enjoying the ocean breeze drawing and she comes up behind me and says hi and we start talking then we swim and she takes me underwater and we swim for hours.. and she shows me the underwater world and I thought that was a very neat dream but yeah anyways.. its just weird.. I guess.. I dont know.. there are more to the dreams and more dreams but then I would just go on and on..

oh and yesterday I called mandies house instead of jess's house.. I find myself always about to call mandies house when I am supposed to call jess's house but I catch myself.. but this time I didn't and I asked for jessica when mandies father answered the phone and I was like.. oh crap.. wrong number sorry.. he probably new it was me.. they all know my voice.. i hate that because I like to introduce myself but yeah.. i just have a really distinct voice to them I guess.. I dont know.. but yeah.. man I am typing fast as if I am in some sort of a hurry.. but im taking lil breaks here and there... but anyways.. i saw mandie at the graduation today.. man.. flashbacks.. lol.. yeah tons of flashbacks today about my past graduation with mandie.. well anyways.. i better get going.. I will post again soon probably.."

"event","<FONT color=#ff0000>Alright.. so I am headed to work but I stop and get me some quiznos first because I was starving.. I hadn't eaten all day and I am not about to go to work on an empty stomach.. thats probably the most stupid thing you could do because the only time you can eat once you are at work is around 7-9 and its only a 30 minute break, but anyways.. so yeah.. I left early.. and got my Quiznos early so I had a lot of time left on the clock.. so I decided to just chill in the parking lot while I ate my sandwhich to pass time.. but I noticed one thing was missing.. a drink.. and boy am I thirsty.. Well I tell myself I will get me something once I finish my sandwhich.. Well.. my phone rings all of a sudden.. Its my friend Amanda.. she just got called out on a really bogus call.. the day she got called out she left a note on my car saying call me with her number on it.. well anyways.. we talked that night but she forgot to tell me one thing.. and thats why she is calling me right now.. she has the filing cabinet key to one of the cubbies at ALS.. so I tell her to meet me at the Circle K which is convienent for me because now I can get my drink.. Now this is where the red comes in.. some of you who read my journals may know the significance behind this and some wont.. sorry about that.. but anyways.. as soon as I walked in the circle K something told me to buy M&amp;M's.. just out of the blue for some strange reason I was compelled to buy some M&amp;M's, but I wasn't going to buy any.. I was just going to get my drink.. but somehow I stumble across a bad of M&amp;M's.. and I am like ok.. well I guess I will buy a bag.. now I haven't bought M&amp;M's in god knows how long.. and for reasons.. but yeah.. so I take the bag of M&amp;M's and a Dr,Pepper.. pay for them.. and wait for amanda in the parking lot.. she drives up.. etc..etc.. etc.. I get the keys.. yada yada yada.. and yeah.. so I go into work and I am just waiting to open this bag but I had to wait until they gave report and the SPEC assigns groups and duties and then hopefully get to ALS and then.. then I will be able to eat them.. so anyways.. turns out I am sent to ALS.. I get there.. get situated and I am getting ready to eat them and BAM..&nbsp;I get a phone call.. and I am like what is going on.. then a client who is enhanced is at another units classroom and the 6/2 shift just let him go when they were supposed to watch him and I have to go get him.. alright so I go get him and I finally have time.. then.. again.. another interruption.. they send me back to the dorm because they tell me I am getting pulled.. ok well anyways.. this post is getting to long and im going to shorten it.. ok.. now I am back on my dorm in the back watching rudy and for sure guaranteed time to eat my M&amp;M's.. ok now these M&amp;M's are the new promotional StarWars Dark Chocolate M&amp;M's.. They are darker in color and well dark chocolate.. and despite all of that.. I opened the bag and there was one single red M&amp;M on top.. and below it were only black, grey, and purple.. not another red in sight.. this was the only red M&amp;M visible.. dead center of all of the other M&amp;M's.. and I just kinda pause and freeze and am like.. what the hell.. I haven't bought M&amp;M's in god knows how long.. and yeah.. a red M&amp;M is on top.. now this is the part where it all probably throws most of you off, lol.. but some of you know what I am talking about.. and well.. I mean there were other red M&amp;M's in the bag but it was just weird that that one single red M&amp;M was dead center on top just staring at me.. but yeah.. I guess you can say that my life started when I stumbled across one single rare red M&amp;M.. and thats why this red M&amp;M being on top has such a centinmental value to it.. why it is so significant in my life.. the color red has alot to do with my life.. its one of my favorite colors.. its a color of Valor and Passion.. and I would like to say that I hold both of those traits.. especially passion.. my favorite movies have the color red in it.. like Moulin Rouge and Chicago.. but anyways.. yeah.. this post is about the red M&amp;M and red in general.. </FONT>"

Jesus christ.. on the way back from work I am well.. driving home and a cop pulls out of a parking lot and I slow down (even though I am only going 3 over the limit) because I know how uptight these cops can be at night.. so I am just on the phone playing it safe when the cop drops back and throws his light on and I am like.. dude what the hell.. the time I play it safe I get pulled over.. turns out that the guys that fixed my car didn't plug my license plate light back on.. and I had an expired inspection sticker.. now that inspection sticker really ticks me off because how the hell am I supposed to know that its expired.. I am always in a hurry to stop and look at the stickers.. I got work or other things to do that keep my mind off of these little things.. well its no big really.. the sticker isn't expensive but yeah.. the whole light thing.. that sorta ticks me off because they should have plugged it back up.. he didn't cite me for that thankfully.. I guess he was a little understanding that I recently got in a wreck and my trunk fixed so yeah.. well anyways.. I better get going.. I will ttyl..

Man this kinda sucks by the way.. because of allegations our Unit.. some of our staff have been realigned to the Central Kitchen which in turn makes us short on dorm.. We are supposed to run the dorm at a minimum of 6 staff.. well tuesday and wednesday is pattern 3's days off.. which is my pattern.. but because of the allegations me and Vangie were the chosen ones by our SPEC to switch our days off.. so instead of working monday.. Vangie has monday off and works tuesday.. and I.. instead of having wednesday off I have to work it and have friday off.. it kinda sucks but I guess its kinda cool too.. I have tuesday off.. work wednesday/thursday.. off friday.. work saturday/sunday.. off monday.. then i work tues,weds,thurs,fri and off the weekend.. so altogether I think it pretty much balances out.. so yeah.. work has its ups and downs.."

I love my car.. Its get me to and fro.. reliable.. good looking.. loaded with many memories.. some good and bad.. but mostly good.. I have put alot of work in the car.. I would truely miss it if I ever came to the decision of getting rid of it and eventually getting a new car.. The only reason why I would consider getting rid of it would be that it is too expensive.. I almost pay 600 a month trying to keep it.. makes it hard to save.. high payment and high insurance payment.. I still owe 7 thousand on it and the car isn't even worth 7 thousand.. and its already at its halflife mileage.. at times I have really thought about getting rid of it because of how expensive it is.. alot of people tell me that I should get rid of it and buy some rinky dink vehicle that I wont have monthly payments on and that my insurance would be lower with.. and the suggestion has been very tempting.. it would allow me to save alot of money.. but I dont know.. its a hard decision.. If I had easier access to money then I would definitely keep my car.. I think we all wish we had easier access to money.. and if you dont.. then you will.. lol.. go to college people..

<P><FONT color=#000099>Man the other day mom's friend Tom came and picked me up to go to Academy.. He wants to take me fishing and since I left all my poles and tackle in Florida, so in order to go fishing I need new equipment.. So I hop in the car and I am not paying attention to whats playing on the radio I am just listening to him because he was asking me how I was feeling and everything due to my medical condition.. so I told him how I felt.. hard to do anything, often hard to breathe, short of breath, hurts to bend, hurts to eat or drink, etc.. etc.. then the ride got kinda silent and my mind focuses on other things like the radio.. but its not very loud so I had to listen harder.. and then it hit me.. We were listening to the Evanescense CD.. Man.. I haven't heard that CD in forever.. Last time I heard it was before me and Mandie went to the Evanescense Concert on May 13, 2003.. We were in my moms car on the way to the Snowball place.. Her first snowball.. No wait.. I think that may have been after the concert.. man I can't remember.. probably cause its getting late.. but anyways.. yeah I dont know.. It kinda felt weird listening to that CD..I guess depressing..&nbsp;I remember burning it for her and somehow she lost it.. lol.. can't believe that.. but I ended up buying her new things anyways.. like the Eisely CD.. which she is really fond of.. I knew she wanted it.. and she deserved it so I went and bought it.. almost kept it for myself, lol j/k.. Eisely is a good band.. Has a unique style about.. very artistic.. melodious and soothing.. but anyways.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Evanescense just had a really big part in me and mandie.. alot of things had a big play with she and I.. music in general for one.. while I was gone in Florida for those two months we would talk every single day.. I sent her cards.. called her on my dads cell.. spoke to her over IM.. sent her video feed of me.. ran to circle k's in the middle of the night to buy calling cards just to talk to her.. Well anyways.. dont really want to get into this right now.. confusing.. depressing.. there are many categories of depression.. and my depression on this subject is probably one of the worst.. I know too much I guess you could say.. arghh.. dont want to talk about this because.. I dont know.. I dont know.. too many people read this journal.. people that know her.. that may not know everything.. things that (granted she kept things from them)&nbsp;she kept from them for a reason and its not my place to expose them.. things that I had to poke and probe for myself because she wouldn't tell me.. but the things that I poked and probed for are things that are very detailed analysis.. something she hated.. but after I found out everything that I needed to know I stopped analyzing.. and still to now I dont.. well&nbsp; the only reason it bothered her was because I made it so apparent and I did it so often.. which was her only pet peeve about me.. so because of that and the effects that it had on people I still analyze to a certain degree but I dont make it apparent.. just keep it to myself.. everybody analyzes.. it just depends on how good they are at it.. and from alot of people I am darn good.. I am not trying to boast I am just simply stating the feedback results from people.. I have even had people come to me asking me to analyze people for them.. there are right and wrong times to analyze and I used to do at the wrong time all of the time.. I was still right on my analyzations.. its just I did it at very non-suitable occasions.. so all of this makes the depression side different.. I still haven't said enough to really back up my depression side being different than other depression because I haven't give you the readers enough proof.. but I can't without exposing things that I can't expose because its not my place.. man&nbsp;I dont even want to post this now.. overall I am just depressed.. I know my journals must be hard to understand alot of the time and I apologize.. its mainly because its either late or I am in a hurry.. but yeah.. I sometimes wish I could just post everything from when my life started on May 13, 2003.. but it would just be way to long and very detailed, including everything.. not leaving one thing out.. I would probably get alot of comments on it though, lol..&nbsp;but yeah.. I have thought about it on&nbsp;many occasions but yeah.. it would take a very long time to write..&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;well it feels a little better writing this.. I should probably get going now... if you guys would like to see a post about my life from may 13th then I could do it.. but it wouldn't be right away because I would first write it by hand making sure that I didn't forget anything.. then copy that to the journal.. well i dont know.. i just needed to post something to lift some of the depression from me temporarily.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33>Oh yeah.. Medical condition.. for now the doctors are not sure of what is wrong with me..as of right now they are ruling it as a muscle spasm.. and that kind makes sense due to the fact that I have been working out lately.. but the thing that gets me is that I haven't worked out in a week or two.. so yeah.. well they said that if the pain doesn't go away within a week then they are going to have to send me to a specialist to stick an IV in me to sedate me.. then perform some operation on me to find out what is wrong.. but the X-Rays proved that I have no tumor pushing against the walls of my esophogus (if I spelled that right) so thats really good.. but if the pain doesn't go away then I could either have an ulcer in my esophogus or the probability of heart problems rises and that is definitely not good.. but anyways.. after the doctor visit me and my grandma were on our way home.. I was driving and the car was silent and all of a sudden she grabs my hand and squeezes tightly saying ""Zekie you have no idea of how happy I am that you do not have a heart condition"" I was really glad too.. its a good thing that I bought that life insurance because my beneficiaries are my lil sis Catherine and Grandma.. both of which would recieve $50,000 dollars if I were to pass away in the near future.. at least they would be taken care of.. lol.. Catherine would have her college money and&nbsp;I would have paid back Grandma for everything that she has done for me.. but then again.. me being gone would really affect her.. especially in the condition she is.. it isn't anything she needs right now.. a family death is something no one in my family needs right now.. but I should be fine.. I dont think I have anything serious wrong with me.. Optimism here people, lol.. This pain will go away.. it probably is just a muscle spasm.. well anyways.. I will keep you guys informed.. see last journal entry about my medical conditions as of then</FONT></P>"

I spent this weekend at the Beach House in Port Isabel/South Padre.. the first day was friday and everything seemed to be going fine.. I was fine just a little tired.. I dont know why I was so sleepy.. I just was.. Well.. anyways.. I had a plan for the next day.. Wake up at 5 AM to go down to the beaches in South Padre to pick up the shells that had washed to shore from the ocean before everyone else got to them.. well I heard the alarm on my ringer but I didn't get up.. and for good reason too.. I got up around 10 or 11 I think.. and it was really windy.. we were supposed to go shooting but because of that darned weather we ended up staying home.. so having nothing in my stomach I decided to go out to Whataburger and get me something to eat.. I got myself the usual.. #5, No tomatoes, No Pickles, and sub ketchup.. took it back to the house and proceeded to eat.. finally.. something to eat.. but before I began to eat I noticed some unusual chest pains.. I just thought that it might be because I am hungry.. So I take a bite.. swallow it.. and on the way down it was very painful.. It hurt really bad.. as the day went on I noticed that the pain was getting worse.. but there was nothing I could do about it.. I am a 100 so odd miles away from home.. I have to wait until I get back.. well anyways.. Sunday came and wow.. the pain was so discomforting.. It really disabled me from doing alot of the things that I wanted to do.. I was a real bum there the whole time because the pain was so bad.. I wasn't talking to anyone.. secluding myself from everyone.. it was just that bad.. it even hurt to breath.. and if I were to breath deeply it would hurt even more.. finally we came home.. told my grandma about it.. she listened to my lungs.. felt around my rib cage and spine to make sure nothing was broken or fractured.. listened to my heart.. and she said everything was fine.. air was passing all the way through my lungs.. no coarseness sounds from my heart.. I was fine as far as we knew.. well she rubbed my back and gave me some tylenol and allegra-d thinking that it may just be congestion.. so I went to bed thinking that it would go away now that I am home and recieved some medicine.. well I was once again wrong.. I woke up and it was still there.. only this time it hurt more to eat or drink.. grandma had set me up an appointment with the doctor and told me that I had to hurry up and leave to make the appointment.. and thats exactly what I did.. I get there.. tell the doctor everything.. turns out that out of the blue I somehow managed to get scoliosis.. and the more I explained the more she got to thinking.. she didn't know what was wrong either.. but she wanted some tests to be done.. so she gave me an order for X-Rays to be done and after that I am supposed to go back to her with the film and then she will see if she can pinpoint what it is that is bothering me.. so I make my way to Alameda to the X-Ray and Nuclear Medicine building where they do mammography, sonagrams, x-rays, etc... etc... which comforted me some seeing how this doctor specializes in all this means that he must know what he is doing.. so I sign in.. they call me in.. turns out I have to pay this x amount of money because of the insurance deductible thingy wasn't met.. after I pay I am sent in the lounge to wait only to find out that AFTER I had paid the tell me that they are working on their machines and I am like.. well what the hell.. at the time I was on the phone with my dad.. He talked to grandma and grandma is all worried about me and now my dad is too saying that he hopes that it isn't any heart problems and all this junk which in turn has got me worried.. and yeah.. Then rudy jokingly tells me that it could be a tumor which wasn't funny at all.. even if you are joking this is still no laughing matter.. hell I am freaking out just wondering that the hell is wrong with me.. and now I have to wait until 3:30 to have the x-ray done.. the pain is elevating.. grr.. 

so yeah.. I personally think that it is just stress related from my depression.. taking alot of blows people give me.. helping people with their problems.. trying to cope and figure out my own problems as well.. work problems.. financial problems.. family problems.. grandma in the condition she is in.. John with shingles, and my grandfather of which I just found out is in the hospital with something known as explosive vomiting and he is hospitalized right now.. and yeah.. grr.. its about time all this stress and depression affects me.. now I pay the price I guess some people would say.. but then again I am usually a confident and calm person.. thats what surprises me.. well all this granted that I do indeed have a heart problem.. which I am staying optomistic about.. my grandma is calling every doctor that I saw today and will be involved with yelling at them for their lack of professionalism etc..etc.. and yeah.. its just having to wait for the machines to be done while I am in pain really gets to me because I want this gone.. it has got me worried and I hate being worried.. 

well I am calm right now.. I just need to call into work and explain to them what is going on.. and I am going to lie down for the time being or do something to pass time.."

"event","So its 4 in the morning.. I was at Jess's and I decided to leave because it was so late.. Everyone was asleep in that house.. well justin went upstairs along with Jena.. she said she would be right back but she never came back.. shes probably still on the phone, and jessica was asleep next to me and I was like.. well im going to go.. so I get my stuff.. didn't want to wake Jess to say goodbye because I know she was tired so I just left.. I walk outside and I noticed that the sky was very bright.. and it was far to early for the sun to be out so I look around and I notice that the moon was hella bright.. but of course its going to be bright.. its a full moon.. but still.. I haven't seen such a bright moon in a long time.. but anyways.. I hop in my car.. listen to Maroon 5 and yeah.. I dont know.. dont know where I am going with this post.. today was just a weird day.. really weird.. stuff on my mind.. I get called on AL along with Rick and James.. they dont send us home because its a bogus call and we are short so we are just going to be monitored.. rediculous.. and yeah..

Nothing special really happened today.. I went to Cassandra's around 3 and we sat and watched TV for a bit.. Then went and picked up her sis at school in MY car with NO gas, lol.. but it was okay.. I was planning to put gas in anyways.. So after we picked her up we went and picked up some food and back to her place where we watched a movie and some T.V.. and that was about it for her house.. I told her I would call her tomorrow but I promised my little sister that I would take her to the movies right after school.. and I would rather hang out with my little sis anyways.. I am glad we are re-obtaining our big bro lil'sis relationship again.. Well back to today..

I left Cassandra's at 8 and headed over to Kohls to chill with Jessicas mom but she was busy so I asked if she wouldn't mind me chilling with her children and she said no.. So I just chilled with them until 12.. Me and Jess cooked dinner and then Justin came home and I made sure he read for his homework.. and Jena finally came downstairs and we played knuckles.. what a dork, lol.. she wanted to play so we did and I ended up winning, lol.. so that was cool.. and we all spent time looking through their family albums.. so that was all cool.. then i left at 12, went on a drive and that was it.. that was my day.. I liked how my day ended.. had fun with them.. lot of laughs.. Their mom was making fun of me too, lol.. but anyways.. yeah that was my day.. Hopefully tomorrow will be cool too.."

"event","I had fun yesterday.. I really did.. I went out with Mandie, my little sis, and her little sis to the Museum.. I thought I would take them out and they have never been to the Museum here so I was excited to take them.. We had a really great time.. There was this guy there that was demonstrating to people his line of work.. He skins birds for a living.. He isn't a taxidermist, what he does is skin them for science purposes.. and it was really interesting.. he was a funny guy too.. lots of stories it was just overall really interesting.. We had to cut our visit to the Museum pretty short because all of us were extremely hungry so I decided to take them to a chinese resturant.. and boy did we pig out.. but man I got full and I started feeling weird.. really weird.. I was full but it was a weird full feeling.. my mood dropped dramatically because of it.. and I was planning to take the little ones to get a snowball and I was really looking forward to it but yeah.. I wasn't feeling really well.. but they had a good time.. enjoyed the snowballs and that was good.. those two are goofs man.. lol.. afterwards we went to Mandies house and they jumped on the trampoline while me and Mandie played some pool.. it was a good day.. I think we all enjoyed it.. 

As for today I went and played football with some friends.. and you all know how hard the dirt is here in the feilds.. well yeah.. when we play football we tackle.. and we have some pretty fast runners and hard hitters and it was fun.. Me and Jerome when we play football we are enemies.. and I am quarterback since I have the arm and agility.. well he rushed me and I saw him but he didn't know that I saw him and so I stood my ground and when he hit me I didn't go anywhere and everyone could hear the hit.. thankfully Ben ran to me and I handed him the ball and jerome just couldn't take me down and after I gave ben the ball I just gave up and he suplexed me, lol.. It was just a hard hitting, adrenaline pumping game.. I took a cut to my hand and left forearm.. a deep scrape to my left lower back.. and a knee to my right upper leg and I am still limping, lol.. it was fun.. I had like 10 touchdown passes that game and 4 touchdowns that I made myself.. It was really fun.. well im posting in a hurry cause i need to shower so this post is really nasty grammatically.. but anyways.. i gtg.. need to shower.."

"event","Life lately has had its ups and downs..

Well I told a close friend of mine that I would watch her kids while she and her husband went on a vacation.. im sure it was well deserved too.. hell I wish I could take a vacation but to the places I want to go.. sheesh.. cost some money.. and I dont want to spend any money right now.. but anyways..

so yeah.. first day of watching them was thursday night after work.. I got there and I had picked up the note on the fridge for me and yeah.. The girls were wondering what the hell it said and everything.. but yeah I couldn't give in.. I had to be the responsible one.. I told them that there are times that I can be a friend and a responsible adult and now is the time to be the adult.. well anyways.. I had to make sure of a few things before I got settled in.. but after that it was cool.. joked around with the girls and watched tv... ate some cheesecake.. and washed some clothes.. and everyone got in bed.. I showered and went to bed myself.. well tried.. they had this pull out bed from the couch and yeah.. most uncomfortable thing on the face of the planet.. I would have rather slept on a bed of spikes than that.. I didn't get one minute of sleep.. I kept turning over and everything.. next thing I knew my cellphone alarm was ringing to wake me up.. man I was tired.. but even though I was tired as hell I got everyone up, made eggs and toast for the little one and took him to school and then the girls.. after that I was still feeling the fatigue.. I was extremely tired so I called up my friend Rick to let him know that I was ready to work out.. but he told me that he was making some payments for his girlfriend and to wait until 10:30.. so I was like well hmmm.. Cassandra lives next to him so Iw ill just drop by over there.. So I pull up to her house and call her up to let her know that I was there.. she freaked out because she was just thinking about me,lol.. She was still in her pajamas when I arrived but she let me in anyways.. when we got to her room I just jumped on her bed as if it was mine.. I was so tired.. its a small bed but hey.. anything was better than that pull out bed, lol.. so we watched a movie for a bit and then 10:30 rolled around and i was like man i dont want to get up so I called rick and let him know that I wasn't going to be there until 1100 at the latest and he said alright.. so yeah.. then 11:00 rolled around and I told her I had to go and she got upset but I told her that I had to work out and she was still upset but yeah.. I left anyways.. but man I didn't want to go.. I just wanted to sleep.. but I had fun working out.. Ive been getting compliments at work lately.. even when i am not there.. I weighed myself the other day and i packed on 2 pounds of muscle and added 60 pounds to my bench in just three days..  so yeah I am doing good in my workouts.. I am waiting for monday to roll around because the guy who I am working out with is setting me up a schedule to follow.. so yeah I am interested in that.. afterwards I just went to work and it was cool i guess.. it was interesting.. I had a good time I guess.. wasn't a bad day.. then i find out that my babysitting is over because of something that happened at school that involved them which is a long story that I wont get in to.. but yeah.. well anyways I have to cut this short and is probably a good thing because this isn't grammatically correct.. its all jumbled because I Was trying to type as much as possible before my mom woke up and told me to get off and well.. she just did so thats why im cutting it short.. but yeah.. anyways.. i'll post more later.."

I was walking into my grandmas room because the wallpaper lady had finally walked out, but to soon return, when I spotted my soon to be read latest National Geographic Magazine residing on her bed.. I had it in my mind the whole time that I searched for medicine to bring some relief to my parasitic illness.. for some strange reason it just doesn't seem to go away.. (I feel as if I got a rampaging rabies infested beaver in my throat and maggots crawling in my back..)

I then decided to wash my hair and brush my teeth.. I leaned over the sink to dip my head in the water flowing from the faucet, when I thought of that above.. sandwhiched between two of what, I think, is probably the most powerful grammatical puncuation ever conceived by mankind.. 

Well anyways, last night I was thinking about college.. and I really truely want to go.. but to me its not a want.. Its like a need.. I mean.. for some reason I feel as if a part of me is empty without school.. Well I know the reason but yeah.. What made me think of it was when I left work.. As I was leaving work, excuse me.. I approached the gate when these Union workers were stopping cars to let us now about the meeting in Austin and if I was going to go.. they handed me the paper and it was the same one I recieved in the mail not long ago of which was titled Pay Raise to 4800 a month.. so without hesitation I asked.. what is this about.. and the man replied.. its about your pay raise.. go talk to Mary at the Pavilion.. she will tell you all about it.. Mary is a good friend of mine so I just might go and do that.. 4800 a month is good and turns out to be 57600 a year which is good comfortable living for a family of three and even better if my wife has a job which pay is somewhat similar, similar or may even surpassing me.. I mean thats a lot of money we would be bringing in a year.. and then I compared the pay of psychologists and my pay if the raise goes into effect.. the Psyhcs earn 5600 a month and earn in the 60-70 k a year range.. and me not far behind with the 57.6k a year.. and I thought, hey I can live with that.. but then I thought about college.. and me just not going to school anymore.. its a rather sad thought.. I mean with a degree I would be professional.. doing something that I like and knowing that if for some reason my position were to be terminated where I work.. I know that I have my degree that shows that I know my stuff and that could land me a job somewhere else with even more pay possibly.. whereas me without my degree.. getting fired or the position is terminated.. trying to apply for another state postion without a degree.. they would be like.. no.. you dont meet the requirements.. so yeah.. I am going to college.. my financial aid meeting is this friday which is tomorrow, lol.. can't wait.. and going to become a Psychologist in MHMR.. 

Hmm.. speaking of college.. I am going to speak to my brother about it.. and even Catherine.. some people may say thats a little to early to be speaking to a child about college.. but I say its never to early.. I want to at least prepare her for what is soon to come.. to get a basic knowledge of things that she could become and want to become.. and john.. already a freshman in highschool and I dont even know if he has college in mind.. if so.. what college and what he plans or would like to do.. and if he has none.. then I can suggest some and see if he likes the sound of them and even tell him about life after highschool.. 

well anyways, I best be off.. I need to.. well I need to so something.. eat, shower.. wash some clothes.. clean my room.. something to keep me busy.. well adios..

Ive got a song.. a song for a friend of mine.. and if not friend than aquaintence.. his name is chris.. Ive read some of his journals and they seem quite interesting.. some horrible experiences he has gone through.. Now I dont know if you are over what happened that time because I barely know you.. and if you are not, or even if you are.. then this song I say is for you.. Eric Clapton - Tears In Heaven.. to me he wrote the song because he witnessed or was victim to a death that played a huge role in his life.. Afterwards I think he may have considered committing suicide.. and at the end of the song one of the verses says.. Cause I know I dont belong here in Heaven.. you really just have to listen to it to understand completely.. but yeah.. i was just listening to Eric Clapton and that song came up and that one journal of yours popped in my head and I thought this song might be suitable for you.. or at least I hope thats your journal, lol..

Eric Clapton is an awesome artist.. I for one love his song Change The World.."

That question really got me thinking.. and her reply made a lot of sense.. I guess I am just trying to get over her.. I feel obligated to do so.. and recently I met a girl that I really began to like.. but the thing is.. we were friends from the start.. real good friends.. i guess almost like bestfriends.. and well we talked alot about each others problems and just hung out in general.. and I began to question myself about my feelings toward her and well I finally came to the conclusion that I liked her.. we both confessed our liking for one another and well we didn't get together or anything but just talked some more.. but then I got to thinking.. wait.. hold up.. This is my bestfriend.. you dont date bestfriends.. bestfriends are just.. well bestfriends.. and nothing more.. I mean.. if I were to have gotten with her.. then.. I could have risked loosing her as a bestfriend in the end.. I mean she is pretty.. there is a physical attraction.. mental as well.. but there is just no sexual chemistry.. and that is because we started out as bestfriends.. almost sister/brother material.. its just weird.. awkward kissing one another.. and if things were to go bad for us in a relationship.. the only reason why I would get back with her would to just regain the friendship.. do anything and everything to keep it and I wouldn't be nearly as happy as I was when I was with my ex.. So in the long run.. it wouldn't be worth it.. I wouldn't want to put myself through all that hell.. so I am glad that I didn't decide to progress things.. 

Well either way I am still in love with my ex.. Yeah I know.. call me stupid if you will.. but if you would have only known her as well as I did.. if you would have only been there with us.. you people would understand.. understand why I believe the things I do and why I am still in love with her.. I emailed her the other day.. It was a late Valentines email.. my Valentines sucked as I was again denied my romantic plans for the second time in a row.. alot of people from work, mainly girls and the girl I was talking about above.. asked me how I would have spent that day with my partner.. and I replied and well yeah.. you know how girls can get.. so yeah.. Valentines was just another day for me.. and I also helped a friend with her problems.. and another with his problems.. and well work sucked.. Our Spec was back and I dont like her.. I despise her immensly.. well anyways.. onto other subjects..

Well as some of you guys know.. I am driving a rental.. so if any of you guys see me in a different car.. dont assume its mine because its a piece of shit.. My car has been in the shop for a while.. it was only suposed to be in there for 6 days but it turns out that they couldn't bend the frame back into shape.. so that have to order a completely new bar and put that one in.. and my car should be ready by the end of this week.. so im waiting.. impatiently but waiting.. im just going to be so happy when I get it back.. 

I think after my six months of work is over I might just quit after 2 more months.. I really just mainly want to go to school.. get financial aid and live off of big grants.. I am still wishy washy about what I want to do but one thing is for sure.. I just want to get back into college.. but I dont know.. people from work suggested that I get a shift change to 6am to 2pm and go to school in the hours after work.. but I dont know.. hey well anyways.. im going to get going.. earlier tofay while I was driving I got an awesome idea for a picture and I am going to go draw the base lines for it so I can at least get some work on in done.. well I better get going now.. later.."

"event","I want my car.. This stupid rental just flat out sucks.. it has no pickup whatsoever.. the other day I was going to cross onto saratoga to go to my bank and the oncoming vehicles were far away.. So I turn on and I notice these people gaining fast.. so I pushed the pedal to the metal, the car revs real loud and doesn't even go fast at all.. Its like the little American car that can't.. it sucks.. it really does.. I just miss my Galant.. they said I would have it in 6 days and now they say not until the end of this week.. ""sigh"".. well I am going to go.. I have no idea of what to post about.."

A story, a photo, a love, a hate, a secret...anything.
Make sure you post it anonymously, though.
You can post as many times as you like.
This is open to non-friends too.</b>

So this is your chance to spam me with anything! Pictures, lyrics, the word spam over and over. Feel free to tell me something about yourself, or screen your comments. Do whatever you want! It's all up to you. 

Okay, so I realize 1000 is a big number so,...just spam away and we'll see what happens. Please entertain me.</b>"

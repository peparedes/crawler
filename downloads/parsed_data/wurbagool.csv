"event","I am now Co-President of the Laurentian Anime Club *snickers*  And I didn't do it with underhanded treachery, any mind games or any lies of the sort.  In fact I am rather mean to some of the members (they're idiots though, and there's no use babying idiots when in the real world they'll discover that it's a harsh place).

Anyway, Scott is no longer President of the Anime Club, nor is Zach (Zack?  Although some people admitted that Zach was more of a help than others.....*cough*)

So yes......it seems, to a degree, I have taken over the Anime club.  And quite by chance.  It will change from this point, and it will be better."

I AER ANIMINAL! MOOOO!

You aren't an animal, you aren't evolved from animals.....man I WISH you weren't evolved from humans, then I wouldn't have to sully myself with being the same race as you (human race, that is).  But then that'd be an insult to animals around.

You have no animal instincts....so you fail as an animal.
You have no creativity, and you belittle the people that are creative......so you fail as a human being.

I may have found you interesting when I was younger, but of course I hadn't had a chance yet to go out and explore the world, to find out that there are good and unique people out there with personalities.

You try to be mysterious....and I guess stupidity is a sort of mystery in and of itself.

Robin is the perfect person to you because you can make her be all that you've ever wished a person to be.....in your head.

You have deluded yourself into believing the things you have supposedly done in the past.

Here are some cold hard facts:

Vixie (you remember her right?  your first 'true love'?) probably had rabies.
Vixie was also probably a lesbian (25% of the vixen population is a lesbian)....so not only did you not attract her species wise, but SEX wise.
Vixie <b>wasn't real</b>.

These are things you created to make yourself seem like you have angst, and you have problems.  The smart people were good enough to smarten up and move along:  Chelle, Jackie, Tay and Myself.

I also blame you for being the cause of that temporary rift between myself and Tay.

.....still having Erectile Dysfunction, Scott?  If so, consult your doctor for some handy viagra pills.  Though I doubt you could ever satisfy a woman either way....with or without a pill.

You suck at fighting games.  Like, REALLY, suck.

You know it makes sense, your wanting to be a teacher of Grade 8 students.  I mean you sure did dig them online!  Jackie and Michelle were in Grade 8 at the time....I think I was too....who knows.  Then Tayce and I got too old and you went after Jackie hardcore......

Young girls did it for ya, eh, Scott?  Best of luck in public school then.

Oh and why am I putting so much effort into this?  Because I care? *snorts*  HIGHLY unlikely.  It's because I'm bored right now, what else can I do?

Get over yourself Scott....there REALLY isn't much there anyway.  You are linear, predictable, boring, and self-centered.

Your life wasn't that hard!  Get over it!  You have NO problems.  You are AVERAGE.  Just like the rest of us.......deal with it.

.....Well no, I am exceptional.  I have a high IQ and I have a few creative, unique bones in my body.

Alright I'm too bored to go on.  I guess maybe if I get bored again I'll write up more things for you to read over, and get angry/insulted/offended over."

"event","I'm tired of people reading this that I don't want reading this.  SO I've moved my diary.  There's a simple reason I'm doing this, and I already said it.

Now for some honesty. <lj-cut>

I have messages for some people out there.  *considers*  Actually very few.  I know these people read it.  And one of them got mad at me because I commented on a conversation he and I had, and he seemed to think I had no right saying it.

1.  Scott:  You could be a good person if you weren't so self-absorbed.....at least I think you could be.  You need to stop using your friends.

And you need to be more responsible Scott.  I am assuming you ran for the presidency of the Anime club?  Well as president shouldn't you be running the club?  Shouldn't you be attending meetings?  Shouldn't you be LEADING?!?!  Even your vice-presidents don't attend.

You are also a bad friend Scott.  And you have surrounded yourself with bad friends, too, I might add.  I do not consider you a friend, you are barely even an acquaintance.  If you ever considered yourself a friend to me you would be more open to communicating with me....but no.

...Oh and back to the 'bad friend' thing...surrounding yourself with.  I guess your best friend really could be Robin....I mean she's perfect, isn't she?  She sprang from your own imagination, permitting you to mold her and make her into your perfect friend.  How convenient that her last name is 'Barkis'....fits perfectly with your preferences.  If she was your best friend why is that we never heard of her until only recently (what, two years ago, perhaps?)

2.  Caro/Jesse:  Actually I have no real problem with the two of you, at all.  Except that you are both TOO good of friends, and a little blind to the people around you.

People sure do like talking about Caro behind her back.  Caro I think you are a sweet, good person, and I am sorry that we have not kept in touch, it is probably my fault.  I just don't like how you two read my journal and I am not informed....it makes me uncomfortable, and I don't really know what to think about it.

Caro....Scott hates you.  He blames you for taking Jesse away, and he thinks that you are too much of a prude and that you have forced your opinions and choices upon him.  Yes, Scott really hates you Caro.  Personally if he was such a good friend to Jesse he would have welcomed you happily, because you clearly make Jesse happy and you both love each other.  But that is my opinion.

Caro, Jesse, you can say what you want towards me, I truly do not care.  I have never claimed to be perfect, and really, if I have failed in anything it has been in not being honest.  I think you are both very smart and creative people.....*shrugs*  You just need to know that, perhaps, people aren't as good as you think they are.

*considers*  Chris:  You're interesting, to a degree, but I'm sure you've realized you do get on my nerves sometimes.  I do not find you amusing, but *shrugs* you go to the Anime meeting, I tolerate you.

.....I have nothing else to say about you Chris, so that's the end of that.

*cants her head thinking*  I think that's all.  I think if, perhaps, some had attempted to try and be better friends they would have spared themselves this.

And you may deny it all you want, you may call me a filthy bitch of a liar, but in all honesty?  I don't care, at this point.

Scott you can try to manipulate the people around you to hate me, but then that just means you aren't a true friend if you can't let them make their own decisions about me.  Let the world work as it will, let the people around you live their lifes as they will.

Oh and Paula (if you read this, if not then I hope you heard about it yourself):  Chris hates you, Zach hates you, Zach's girlfriend (what's her face, I forget) hates you.  They all think you're boring and lack a personality.  I really can't say too much.

That's more for Paula/Scott really that one.

You must be careful the secrets you unleash, really, especially if you don't know a person very well.  Because you never know what that person may absorb, remember, and store.  *grins*

If you want to know about the new diary, you can go try and find it.  Or you can e-mail me.  It's not that hard.

*grins*  Most of you will get to know where it is.....I don't know, though, if I'll let you truly read it though."

ONE thing I'm considering for her.  Because of her low constitution I thought I might spruce up her appearance with a scar on her face, but sadly it's a tragic scar as it took out her left eye.

NOW what sort of effect will THIS have on her archery skills, etc. etc.?  See when I'm thinking about it, it has very little effect on a person.  My Uncle Rick lost his eye in an accident when he was 6 or 7 and he still managed to: take rapier lessons in his teens (he took piano lessons when he was 9-10) AND he's a Chef.  Being a Chef requires co-ordination, as we all know.

Sadly that just goes to show that I can still succeed even in University without applying myself; it's not teaching me any lessons about how I need to apply myself to my lessons.  I mean look at the example of the psychology test I didn't study for at all:  60%

The mark would be considerably higher if I were to begin the routine of studying for 15 minutes every day.  But my time is taken up with role-playing and chatting with friends, etc. etc. etc.

"event","After my usual daydreams/dreams from last night, today I started to think (by the way I Just got up).  My life, in many ways, is boring.  And in a way that suits me just fine.

But then I started to think:  ""If I could have the life of any friend, I think I'd want Tay's.""  

Tay is of course going to say ""Fnarf"" to that, and after Fnarf, she and Jorge will remind me of the crap she's been through lately.  But I'm really not wanting her life for emotional aspects, at least not in that sense.

See Tay has adventures.  She did the Canadian roadtrip across Canada (with hilarious consequences *snickers*), and I got to meet her.  She's done other stuff too, she lived on her own for awhile, she had jeeps, she buys stuff on eBay (that is exciting for me, I dunno why), she lives in Edmonton and she has her adventures there (wearing the crown of thorns and the tail thing, but that was ages ago).

So yes, if I could have the life of any of my friends, I would choose to live Tay's life.....sadly Tay will have to lead someone's life because I am living hers and she will have to suffer through mine, unless she can pick someone else's life to lead.

And in the end someone will have to lead my life, and I pity them.

I have to leave for a test in an hour *sighs*  Shower time.

Oh and I'm going out Friday or Saturday night.  It's Disco Fever night (I'm not dressing up, I can't afford disco clothes), and then they're going on a Mystery Bus Tour.  I'm going to go, just 'cause it's something to do.....

I've found a long way back to sanity again
Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do
When I get there...
Take a breath and hold on tight
And spin around one more time
And gracefully fall back to the arms of grace

'Cause I'm hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't wanna speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside Heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I wanna be, yeah
Where I wanna be...

I'm looking past the shadows in my mind
Into the truth and I'm
Trying to identify the voices in my head
God, I wish it were you
Let me feel one more time what it
Feels like to feel and
And break these callouses off of me one more time

'Cause I'm hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't wanna speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside your door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I wanna be, yeah-ah...

I don't want a thing from you
I bet you're tired of me
Waiting for the scratch to fall off
Of your table to the ground...
'Cause I just wanna be here now...

'Cause I'm hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't wanna speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside Heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
It's where I wanna be, yeah...

On Friday I tried out my new exercise plan...you know.....well I didn't really stick to it, 'CAUSE I tried out the bike (one of the best ways to lose weight) and I realized something:  1.  It is SO boring and 2. It hurts my bum.....

I managed 10 minutes on there before I had to hobble off.....and my bum is big.

And the boredom factor of course.  It's so much more fun to ride a bike SOMEWHERE....the only SOMEWHERE I'm riding that standard bike to is a better body, but STILL I want a view that changes.

When I get home, since we don't have a stationary bike, I am going to make it a point to go for a bikeride every day.....

Even if it's just 100 times around the block, I don't care, at least then I'll have the tease of the wind against my body, the sight of things rushing past me.

Plus I'll have my VERY PRIVATE pool to swim in when I get home!  VERY PRIVATE....which not only means 1.  Skinny Dipping at midnight but 2.  I don't feel self-conscious in a bathing suit.

There's a convention I'm going to for the room that I role-play with.....it's August 1st the official day, and I thought.....well I dunno, I wanna try to lose around 2-3 pounds a week.  *tsks*

WHICH means:  No more junk food (or at least very little) and going to the gym at LEAST 3 times a week.

So I'm going Monday nights, Wednesday mornings, Thursday nights, Friday nights, Saturday nights.....

*sighs*  2 hours each....or at least an hour and a half.  And they say at least 30 minutes of exercise 3 times week is good....well I'll be taking it to the extremes.

Plus there's the fact that most nights I usually do exercises here....jumping jacks, stretches, lift my weights.  *grins*  When I get home though I won't have easy access to the gym.

But I will (hopefully) be working long hours on the line, and week-ends I'm going to look for a job as well (maybe nights as well.....I need the money *sighs*).

See not ONLY am I planning the Mutie-Con, but for the Canada Day long week-end I'm going to go to Alberta and visit Tay and Catherine. :)  WEEEEEEEE and whoever else they want to introduce me too *grins*.

I SO wanted 1984 to turn out differently *sighs* and I think that's why it's such a great book!  1984 is one of my favourites (NOTHING like Watership Down, mind you, but STILL good!)

Dude I am SO rocking at RP tonight....here's what I've done so far....<lj-cut>

She stood up from the microscope, her hand self-consciously brushing back a few brown strands of her hair.  She had been in the lab all day, and the few technicians that remained gave her a strange, worried, and yet lustful looks.  Tiredly her hand lifts and she pushes her glasses out of the way so that she can pinch and massage the bridge of her nose.  

""You've been at this all day, Doctor,""  the shy, rotund lab assistant offered her in a soft voice, offering her a cup of coffee.  

""I have to make up for the time we lost because of 'Big Brother',""  she mumbles idly, taking the coffee.  She walks to the table in the center, where a rat hovered in the middle of the cage, asleep.  

She jotted down a few notes, took a sip of her coffee and wandered over to one of the assisstants sat drooping and rocking in his chair.  It was the soft rustle of her labcoat that jerked him awake and he sat up, a guilty flush marking his pale features.

Her deep brown eyes pierce them both, her hand having dropped from the bridge of her nose, and she watches them a moment.  ""I just have to write up some reports.  You can both head home.""  Her voice was quiet and soft, a dismissal.  The pair glanced at each other and they both quickly nodded their thanks.  Moments later they had left, both of their suitcases stuffed full of reports they were to have handed in on Sunday.  

Kanzaki idly grabbed up her clipboard full of notes and left the lab, shutting off the lights.  The building was dark; save for one room, light streaming invitingly from the door.  As she walked she efficiently snapped open her labcoat, revealing a dark red dress-suit, and sheer black nylons underneath.  The labcoat hung down to mid-calf and fluttered softly behind her as she walked.  The few stray wisps of hair fluttered about her head, almost like a halo and her eyes were hidden and devoid of any sight, the glasses reflecting the light and making her expression unreadable.  

Into her office she walks, and inside she silently closes the door.  The clipboard was placed next to the laptop, and then the cup of coffee.  ""Another long night,""  she whispers softly to the room, as she rubs the back of her neck.  Her long brown hair was tied back in a ponytail, but the silky strands had managed to escape.  Her deep red suit was the emotion of fury...of passion....of anger...of blood.  It clung gently to her breasts before dropping down, a red blouse that whispered and slithered with soft silky intimacy against her skin, and then the red skirt that fell to midthigh.  With each step, if one could see through the labcoat, it tightened around her thighs and then her ass, teasing and enticing.  With it her labcoat open one could see that with every glide of her foot the dress hiked up an inch and dropped down.  She leaves her labcoat on; the heat had been turned down low, and the extra warmth the labcoat provided was helpful.  

Her office was set up strangely; a metallic, sterile floor beneath her feet, tapping gently with her heels, a large mahoggany test dominated the center of the room, and behind it, so that every entrant could see, there was a bank of screens against the wall (behind a glass wall).  This allowed one a view of everything occuring within her lab, every room was observed; but right now all the screens were dark, except for the merest hint of light here and there.  Since she no longer held mutants hostage here there was no more 24/7 security.  Now she just had a guard patrolling the area every so often.

She drops down into the large plush chair, a soft groan of exhaustion escaping her naked lips, and she sits there, for a moment, tilting her head back, her lips parting softly.  She couldn't do this much longer; the long nights and days.  She had to put in at least 14 hours a day here, maybe more.  She worked harder than any of her employees....and she didn't get paid really.  Sitting there in the large, comfortable chair, her hands resting upon the arms her eyes flutter shut and her breath evens out slightly; presumably she's drifted off in the chair.

.....

Yeah so that was just ME....I was introducing the scene (I'm doing a side-line thing with someone).  This is set in the X-Men rp room I play in, and Doctor Kanzaki is....well a human female version of Magneto, except anti-mutant.  She is Magneto's foil in some aspects....except that she's chaotic neutral....she has a long storyline that I won't get into.

This was done on MIRC so I apologize for the poor; grammar, paragraphs, etc. etc.  Any suggestions on how I can improve my rp are welcome (I think I'm OKAY....but I wanna get better).

I worked up a schedule for myself:

5 minute warm-up
30 minutes on the cross-trainer
10 minutes at the weights (to work my upper body)
30 minutes on the 'bike
10 minutes at the weights
30 minutes on the treadmill
10 minutes at the weights
5 minute cool down

I intend to go to the gym on the following days:  Monday, Wednesday (if I'm not too busy), Thursday, Friday, Saturday

Those are the days when people are usually too busy with their social lives to really go (especially Friday at like 11am and Saturday at 6pm).....

I dunno the cardio-vascular room (which is where I go) is open 7am to 9:30pm....

*shrugs*

Oh it's a heatwave today.....and why do I have to like the people that I like?  It hurts sometimes.  *sighs and curls up*

Rene and I are flirting a lot lately...he's a sweetie.  *chuckles*  He was having fish two days ago, and he was telling me he was going to start an 'Alpha Male' diet....he thinks he's like an Omega Male.  I told him that I thought he was AT LEAST a Beta Male.

And he sits next to me.....that doesn't happen often, and we joke around.  There's no touching.....I don't do touching.....but he's still there.  And sometimes I'm tempted to reach out and see what would happen if I DID touch him?  Would he pull away?  Would he stop sitting next to me?  Would he look at me strangely?  Would he evaporate in a puff of smoke?

*tsks*  I cleaned my keyboard but some keys stick...like the Enter key, and the //?? key (you know the one)....but that's about it.

The keys work a lot faster (like if I hold down the space or backspace key it goes much faster than before).

I have to write a thing for philosophy on 'why bad things happen to good people'....I have it all in my head.  My arguments are:  according to 'Job', bad things happen to good people as a test to see how faithful they are to god
Life is random and chaotic and bad and good things can happen merely by chance to anyone, good or bad
Everyone has set trials set before them by fate where they go through bad AND good periods, despite their alignments to good or evil
Because there is no God but just Satan and he really hates good people so he punishes them for BEING good with bad stuff

I really like that last one *snickers*.  But those are basically my arguments of why bad things happen to good people.

My own beliefs lean more towards the non-God oriented ones (well any sort of religious diety).

I'm done."

"event","Weird dreams seem to be crowding my brain lately!  This one was totally stupid and retarded.

First of all I dreamt about these two children being lost and going to this woman's house.  But the woman wanted to kill them.  The children escaped to a bridge, but the little boy needed his sister's pills so she would live so he went to get them (they were scattered on the half-finished bridge) but the woman came and killed the child.

The boy freaked, and he jumped into the (cold cold cold) water, but the woman followed and she eventually got him and stabbed and killed him.

That was the first dream, the next dream:  I was married to Corey (a guy here).

Now this dream was especially weird because:  since we were married the SGA (student organization thingie) gave us a free trip somewhere (That's why Corey married me).

And we went to the super market and we were having fun (I wanted banana's and we got banana's).  BUT for some reason Corey wanted to be the woman and I had to the be man (in BED guys, I'm not being sexist....I don't know exactly how to explain it....but it was weird and gross....)  but other than that it was cool.

I lived in his residence room, but I still had mine.  And I remember in the dream thinking:  'I can't sleep here!' so I came back to my room, but he followed me and dragged me back.

I dunno....it was just WEIRD okay? *tsks*

It kinda reminds me of an episode of MASH, Hawkeye decides to quit drinking for a whole week, and then after a really harsh OR session he goes into the Officers Club or whatever with his friends and he has a vodka put in front of him, and he excuses it that he 'needs' it...

But then before he can sip it he stops and pours it on the ground and leaves saying;  ""I'll come back when I don't need it anymore.""

So yeah.....I want to have control over myself, over my wants and needs.....the fear that I did something last night is strong.

Things I don't remember:
Half the times I fell
Coming from downstairs to upstairs
Changing my clothes (pyjama's...well really a t-shirt, and it was inside out)
....(and this embarrassing) but some feminin hygene shit....I don't remember that at all.....I dunno what I did, but all I know is that I don't have to worry about TSS or whatever....Toxic Shock.....yeah whatever.

Things I do remember:
Fish's friend talking to me (I think he was trying to pick me up...not sure).
Calling this guy Wayne....I don't remember why.
Talking to Chelsea
Going outside in just a t-shirt and sweater 'cause I didn't want to do coat check (and it didn't feel cold)
Coming back before even leaving the property because The Pub was lined up super busy!
Calling Don
Calling a friend from the US (should be an interesting phone bill, to say the least).

Anyway yeah....*shakes her head* a few other things, like I almost broke my ankle (it hurt for awhile) and that I couldn't stand up on the floor after my pukefest in the garbage can (I don't think Jill's too happy about that, but I'm gonna mop the floor as I said).  My motor skills were SEVERELY lacking.

I quit drinking for this month, and like Christine I am going to concentrate on improving my MIND and my BODY (a shame she lives so far away because you could like do it together in person and SO totally kick ass!).

But....yeah *stretches* instead of drinking I'll put my money towards....hmmm movies at least.

I see need to see Darkness Falls and Final Destination 2....and....*shrugs and sighs and stretches*  Ever since I started hanging out with Don and them I've gone to see more movies than ever.

I may buy a car over the summer, a cheap $5000 one......who knows?  *chuckles and walks off*"

"event","I don't know where it came from but the imagery and feelings were very poignant.
<lj-cut>
There had been a large LARGE school built in Port Perry, and they wanted only the brightest, bravest people.  For some reason I was part of the list of people to participate in the trial.

We went all around the world to complete puzzles (I remember this one in China), except that someone had leaked the trial...so they had to change it.  So we stayed the day and we were playing a game outside.

But I remember seeing this like it was a movie:  one of the snobby girls was in the bathroom, and she hung herself (well she was HUNG because they THOUGHT she was the leak)....and the ball flew and crashed through the bathroom mirror and the curtains parted and we could see her.

Well I was back home and I was talking to my father (not my real father, my dream father, who was a cop) and I told him what had happened.  

And then I started being driven to school, and every time there was a red light, we'd stop and at the red light, every time, I would turn my head and look into this other car (the passenger one, so I was behind the driver) and there would bethis child, surrounded in gray, just staring at me.

Earl was in this dream, as well, and I figured out that we were all being monitored/followed and listened to....so one day I offered Earl a drive (with some guy, I'm assuming my parents were rich in this movie 'cause we had a driver), and sitting in the back I told Earl quietly that we were being watched and monitored to avoid any future leaks.  I ALSO told Earl that the last three trials (8, 9, and 10) were supposed to be the most dangerous trials....

And then I looked up and I saw this kid standing in the bushes staring at us and I told Earl that now was not the time, and he saw the kid and he nodded.

Well I get home that night and I tell my dad about it, and he agrees there's something funny about it, and then he's called in for some emergency at the police station.

He leaves but he says he'll send someone over.  Like 20 minutes later the guy shows up, and it's this guy (in my dream) that I Have a crush on....and he likes me too.

I tell him what I think is happening, and.....I dunno what happens, it's gotten rather dark and stormy, and we go out to the roof to watch the storm.  We live like over the ocean, and our house has this thing extending from the roof over the water....and usually I hang out there....HE decides to climb it, to get to the top, and I remember the fear as I yelled;  ""Oh no!  Don't DO that!"" and he got on safely...but I was still scared (because he slipped at one point as he worked to scramble over this part).

Eventually he starts coming down but he slips, and he's dangling over the ocean, and I shriek.  He looks at me and says;  ""It's just a drop.....but damn you why couldn't you love me?""

And I raced forward to try and help him but his grip slips and he drops down.  I race to the edge and peer down, and I Hear him yelling something....a place I think, not sure, but then he plummets down.

There was MORE before all of this, I remember I did the trials too, and they were puzzles and obstacle courses and I did them very well.....and I remember this man approaching me before THAT to have me work.

It was a long dream, and it was an exciting dream and I remember thinking:  'I could write a book about this when it's over'....I dunno if it was dream me or real me that thought that *tsks*

But all in all it was a good dream, I didn't want to wake-up from it......I hope I dream about it again.

""Oh you've just recently read Alice in Wonderland, hmm?  And you love it?  Well I've been in love with Alice in Wonderland for 10 years."" or ""You love 1984?  Just recently read it?  Well when I was 19 I'd read it 3 years before that....and I'm 30 now...I am a true fan, you are just a child attempting to be intelligent.""

I am not insulting anyone I know, but that's what I'm afraid of.  If I express a NEW interest in something that I never had an interest in before, I'll be accused of being a poseur, a wannabe.....that I'll never truly get it.

""Oh you think the underlying theme of 1984 is politics?  How QUAINT.....actually it's...."" (actually I haven't read 1984 yet, but yeah).

I've missed out on a lot of books.  When I was a child I had a tendency to avoid books by both male authors and with male protagonists.  I just never read them.  I only read books with female authors and/or female protagonists.....I don't know why....because I related better to males?

It wasn't until I was in grade 9 that I was opened up to male authors and male protagonists, and how they could be just as interesting as females.  I thank Heinlein for that.

But still I was reluctant, then, to go for true classics, or to wander far from my genre of 'fantasy' or 'science-fiction'.

And when I want to just do some light reading, I'll still pick a book with a female protagonist over a male....*shakes her head*

But still, I'm scared of voicing my newfound interest in these classics for fear of being mocked, of being ridiculed of being thought 'slow'.

They insult the shows CONSISTENTLY...they were only really quiet during Bebop, ya know?  ANYWAY, yeah, so, totally....I just figured that, ya know SOME people enjoy the shows......and SOME people are tired of it.  So after really a handful of insults to some people (mostly Chris, and on their intelligence for the most part....and yeah I called two people Albert Fish, Chris and Miller).

Hehehehe....that was funny;  ""I like that little girl.""  and I was like; ""Who are you, Albert Fish?""  I was amazed people knew about that Boogeyman.

And yeah I'mma gonna try for President Next Semester.  I SHALL RULE WITH AN IRON FIST.....

I really don't understand the point though, and it's kinda insulting:  You take the position of President, okay I get that, but you never show up to the meetings?  The Vice-Presidents you appointed never show up......what's the point?

This is not what I foresaw when I thought of Anime clubs:  this is not what I hear happens with most Anime clubs at other Universities.

If I were President I would change a few things:  organization for one thing, maybe trying to increase the attendance, CHARGING people that AREN'T Laurentian students for coming *coughs and eyes around*  might be somewhat unpopular, but I figure:  we don't get money for their being there from Laurentian.

I dunno, I just have some WACKY idea.  I'd probably PUT a membership fee if I were President, and basically for prizes and little things for people that attend.  Like $1 per meeting....once a month we have a draw or a trivia game where the winner is decided and they get an Anime related prize.....

*thinks and shrugs*  We'll see......I just think it's kind of pointless to have the name and never really do anything.  Maybe I'm just a power-tripping little thing, maybe I just have this thing for making things better, helping things being realized to their FULL potential.

*shakes her head*  Or even Wade would be a better president (but since he has a girlfriend).

Anyway Miller suggested they'd probably need a new President next year and I was like;  'I'd be willing to run for it' and I guess Chris tried to make me feel uncomfortable and he was like;  ""So then you can realize your goal to become Queen of Anime.""  and I was like;  ""I already am in Port Perry...""

And really?  I probably already am in that club :P  NO ONE does anything.  Fuck I know I might be a bad president, but at least I'd give a shit, and at least I'd try.

But now I'm so tired.

I will now leave you with a few 'quotes/conversations' from <u>Alice in Wonderland</u> that I found vastly amusing or intriguing.

<lj-cut>

""I don't much care where -- "" said Alice.
""Then it doesn't matter which way you go,"" said the Cat.
""-- so long as I get <i>somewhere</i>,"" Alice added as an explanation.
""Oh you're sure to do that,"" said the Cat, ""if you only walk long enough."" (pg 57)

((here's the quote from my poster!!!  And the conversation following.))
""we're all mad here.  I'm mad.  You're mad."" [Said by the Cheshire Cat]
""How do you know I'm mad?"" said Alice.
""You must be,"" said the Cat, ""or you wouldn't have come here."" (pg. 58)

'Well!  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' though Alice; 'but a grin without a cat!  It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!' (pg. 58)

""Have some wine,"" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
[Alice after looking for it:] ""I don't see any wine,"" she remarked.
""There isn't any,"" said the March Hare.
""Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,"" said Alice angrily.
""It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,"" said the March Hare. (p. 60)

Riddle put forth by the Hatter:  ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?"" (pg. 60)

""If you knew Time as well as I do,"" said the Hatter, ""you wuldn't talk about wasting <i>it</i>.  It's <i>him</i>."" (63)

[Hatter] ""I dare say you never even spoke to Time.""
""Perhaps not,"" Alice cautiously replied;  ""but I know I have to beat time when I play music.""
""Ah!  That accounts for it,"" said the Hatter.  ""He won't stand beating."" (63)

""You mean you can't take <i>less</i>,"" said the Hatter:  ""it's very easy to take <i>more</i> than nothing."" (65)

[Alice] ""I don't think ---""
""Then you shouldn't talk,"" said the Hatter. (67)

""Every thing's got a mortal, if only you can find it."" (79)

""I make you a preset of everything I've said as yet."" (81)

""Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,"" the Mock Turtle replied; ""and then the different branches of Arithmetic - Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision."" (86)

""I mean what I say."" (92)

You people are selfish and disgusting and really I don't understand you.  WHY?!?!

<b>SELFISH</b>!!! That's all I have to say!  Delete the journal, cancel it, and let other people make use of it.  YOU are not the only person in the world that may want to use that name; in fact there are people that <b>will</b> use that name, unlike you!

Do the world a favour and stop being a hog, let someone that can write, that can do justice to those names take it over.

You should not be allowed to claim a name unless you write!  If you do not write then your diary should be stripped from you and your IP address banned from registering a nickname for....the next 6 months.

"event","I have set aside <u>The Piano Man's Daughter</u> for the time being as I have returned from a happy hunt at the Laurentian University Library.

My handwritten diary is open and the top of the page has been marked; ""Quotes"" (since these are not my books, yet, I have taken it upon myself to physically rewrite these quotes by hand (as I will do for ALL quotes eventually, I shall have books and books of them....to collect and such)).

What books am I the proud renter and pruveyor of?  <u>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass</u>, <u>1984</u> and ""Diaries of Lewis Carroll, Volume I"" (1832-1867).

I'm going to be reading the Diary and Alice in Wonderland at the same time, (as the diary is written around the time that Alice in Wonderland was written, which should give me a really keen perspective to the book).

It's sad though, when I look at the back of these books, at the times they were last loaned out:

""Diaries of Lewis Carroll, Vol. I"" was last rented:  Oct 30, 1995 (well that was when it was due).
1984:  Jan 11, 2002
Alice in Wonderland:  Dec 9, 2002 (the only recently loaned out one, but when I look through the list of other dates, there were brief 2 year intervals).

The books I chose are all hard cover, the copy of 1984 is almost falling apart, the cover, it's split and water damaged (and I am so happy, there's nothing like an old book, you know....it gives it character).

*sighs*  I wish I could conveniently 'lose' them, but they must cost a lot.  *shakes her head*  Maybe I'll ask the librarian....

*chuckles*  Flipping through the diary (just flipping quickly) I spotted what I thought was the name; ""Lara Croft"" but I refound it (I think) and it said 'to the Croft'.....

I found some other great books, that I will keep an eye open for....and not ust in the library.  Because I have a feeling that they would make excellent gifts for some people (especially considering some people's love for Alice in Wonderland *sage*).

My plans to become the perfect, serious, dedicated student are failing.

I've been reading <u>The Piano Man's Daughter</u> by Timothy Findly and I've found some nice quotes.  I'm only 1/4 through but.....here we go;

<i>I'm yours forever.</i>  Ede's edict was; <i>I'm </i>mine<i> forever</i>.

To love without reason was to condemn yourself to misery, all for the sake of mindless custom.

<i>...the longer she has to dream up a future, the better off she'll be.</i>

<i>I was struck like a match, I had no option but to burn.</i>

<i>This is me.  This is us.  This is now.  Forever</i>

<i>In loving one, you gain a multitude of strangers who were intended to be kin.</i>

There is a long passage on page 76 that particularly draws me;<lj-cut>

[<i>Help,</i> she heard.  Whispering.  <i>Help us.</i>
Lily stared.
Arms. Legs. Faces.
Burnt hair.
Burnt dresses.
Burnt eyes.
Shoes.
She knelt in closer.  Nearer.
Fire-but no flames.  Smoke-but only the smell of it.
She reached in over the top and grased a doll hand between her fingers.
<i>Please don't leave us here</i>.
No.
One out.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Then more, without number, there being no number in Lily's mind beyond four.
When the final doll was retrieved, Lily sat in their midst and wondered if these could be the children of the woman in the attic.  Or the man.  Someone's children--lost.
Perhaps her own.]

Just to understand: the person in the attic is one of those designing dress bodies you use, sans head, arms, legs, etc. etc.  Lily is a young girl who has seizures and she's very alone.</lj-cut>

Just two more quotes now, I promise.

<i>there is nothing in this life that cannot be borne with grace.</i>

<i>The cause of all my joy.  And all my grief.</i>

The start of my quote collection has started.

I have my test in 20 minutes, I should go now."

""OUCH! that's gotta hurt!""

""TOO SLOW!!!!""

Yeah it was fun....and I was laughing so hard, and afterwards it was over....dude my hands are red and swollen (dulling down some) but it was fun.  Maybe I'll do it again *chuckles*  We'll see what a night does.

Other than that?  I'm finishing off my last vanilla coke.  My essay isn't even started yet (and for a good reason)."

"event","Some of my favourite poems here.  The first is;  ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"" by Dylan Thomas.
<lj-cut>
Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lighting they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</lj-cut>
This poem makes my eyes a little bright, and makes me.....sad....*sighs* Because everyone fears the death of their fathers I think, to a degree.  Even those that hate their fathers would be sad.....even if only because they could not tell their fathers why they hated them.

The other one I heard in my English class and then they showed the scene were Robin Williams reads it out?  Yeah...I went and rented the movie and watched it all and that poem made me cry and fall in love with that poet.

It is Sonnet XVII my Pablo Neruda....(Mercution reminded me of this too.  It's always somewhere in the annals of my mind, but sometimes I need a reminder.
<lj-cut>

I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
I love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul.

I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers;
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;
so I love you because I know no other way
than this: where <i>I</i> does not exist, nor <i>you,</i>
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep.
</lj-cut>

I'm sure it's more beautiful in it's original language, but it's still very moving, very beautiful like this.

To me this poem is <b>love</b>.

And now by e.e. cummings (Chris introduced me to him...and from there I went.)  I don't know the title of this poem....to me this poem represents <b>life</b> and <b>living</b>.
<lj-cut>

i thank You God for most this amazing
day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees
and a blue true dream of sky; and for everything
which is natural which is infinite which is yes

(i who have died am alive again today,
and this is the sun's birthday; this is the birth
day of life and of love and wings: and of the gay
great happening illimitably earth)

how should tasting touching hearing seeing
breathing any--lifted from the no
of all nothing--human merely being
doubt unimaginable You?

(now the ears of my ears awake and
now the eyes of my eyes are opened)
</lj-cut>
That there's god in it means nothing to me, I can still appreciate a poem and it's meaning.

People need to do this more often.  Go out there, look up poems, read poets and just put them up somewhere so people can better understand you and your tastes.

I've been meaning to do this for awhile, too.  I need to do one on quotations.  I do so love quotations.  Funny ones, serious ones.....

Which is why I'm going to go through all my favourite classic books, all my favourite NOW books and pick out quotes from them and write them down and compile them....and carry them around and then one day if I have a son or daughter and give it to them and say;  ""This is what I have read and thought were so important, so good, so wise.  I hope you enjoy them, and I hope you read these books and find your own books.""

I will take quotes from famous people, from politicians from friends and write them down too.  And I will give that to my grandchildren, or something like that and say;  ""This was the world when I was younger.  These were the beliefs, the thoughts, the wisdoms, the idiots.....here is everything that I have heard and seen, that I have experienced and known....now you will understand my past better.""

*blinks*  I have no idea where all that came from, I really don't.  I never knew I could write so seriously, so somberly.

But that is a good idea, I think I will start doing that....*nods and hums and finishes it before she subjects people to her bad poetry*"

I went looking for Alice in Wonderland, figured it would be pretty simple.  The book thing said it was in the PR section # 4000 (well in the 4000's).  Was it?  NO!!!!

And Sarah was with me, and I didn't want to drag her ALL AROUND the library for NAUGHT.

*sighs*  I'll get it tomorrow."

I'm already reading Timothy Findly's 'The Piano Man's Daughter'....but I feel like a classic.

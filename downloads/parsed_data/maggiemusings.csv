"event","Many things in life require having experience. Jobs ask what experience you already have in a particular field, but not many are willing to give you the opportunity to generate that experience in the first place. I know that my sense of direction is horrible, unless I've driven a road a few times, then I'm pretty able to visualize how to get from Point A to Point B. 

I've always said to my friends, it's vitally important to have had at least one boyfriend before their first serious relationship, that way they've already gone through the pain of breaking up, and know that they don't want to go through that again, as well as knowing the boundaries of a relationship. 

Yes, I am advocating having your heart broken. 

It isn't simply because mine has been, and I'm bitter about it. (Though it was, and I really used to be.) It's because that heartbreak and that experience of loss and loneliness is what makes you a better girlfriend/boyfriend in the future. I am so much better for what I have been put through, and I put so much more effort into my current relationship, trying to be not only a good girlfriend to be with, but a good person to be with.

Hear me out: The saying goes, ""It is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved before,"" yes? While people who have recently gone through a major breakup won't agree, I'm sure, I think that statement is accurate, but not complete. 

As much as it hurts, and as much as it sucks, it really takes going through something that emotionally painful to truly appreciate when you do actually find love. So I offer you a new twist to that quote: ""You become a better and stronger person for having loved and lost, than if you had never loved before."" (It's still a work in progress, but it's getting there.)

There has been research done on divorced people that remarry, and they actually have a lower divorce rate than people who get married for the first time. The idea is this: that they know the pain of divorce and loss, and they'll be damned to go through it again. They look for people who are more compatible to them, and who will give their lives fulfillment. They also seem to work harder at their second (or beyond) marriage to salvage it. Now there are some people who divorce and remarry multiple times, but that is NOT the majority.

I am NOT advocating divorce, by any means. 

I am simply applying those ideas to dating, which holds less strings than marriage. Pardon my callousness, but if you can get your heartbreak out of the way now, while you're dating people, than chances are you'll work harder at your future dating relationships, and eventually your marriage.

And besides, even though when you go through a break-up, you feel worthless and unattractive, when you finally find that love of your life, you feel like a phoenix, rising from the ashes to become more beautiful than ever before. 

Perhaps the ashes are what make the phoenix that much more beautiful."

"event","Its alright that you never loved me. Looking back now, I don't think I loved you either.

You broke my heart in quite a few pieces, I still find them scattered here and there, and you made my last birthday the worst I've had in a very long time. Believe me, I've had horrendous birthdays before, but that one took the cake. 

Its alright, because you made a small part of my life so incredibly happy. I live for the little things, and you were so good at them. I miss you so much, no matter what I've said to anyone. You wanted me to just disappear, and in your life, I guess I have. I let you go that day in June, and if you want to forget all about me, that is your choice. I can't forget you, and I don't want to either. 

I thought you really were my first love, and it might take me years to actually move on completely, but I will. I will find another person who can make me happy, and who will keep me happy. I will find my love to grow old with, to have children with, to spend my life with. All the hurt I felt from you will be worth it in the end, because I've learned from it, and it has made me stronger. If you saw me now, you might not recognize me, for I am forever changed. 

I could have done horrible things after that day, broken your trust as you had broken mine, but I didn't. I didn't contact you at all, I knew you wouldn't want to talk to me, and I respected your space. I am the perfect woman, the perfect girlfriend anyone could hope for, but you didn't know it, and you still don't. You're too young to realize what you had, and its mea culpa, because as a rule, I don't date older guys. Maybe one day you'll understand, but it will probably be too late. 

You are now just a chapter in my life, and that chapter is closed."

"event","I have serious issues with trust. I've always been far too trusting, willing to give more than enough chances, and having a hard time saying no to people. This past year I was hurt quite a few times because I trusted too much and too quickly. I'm in a state now where I trust nobody. I haven't trusted myself for a long time, and now more than ever I don't trust myself. I used an old boyfriend for selfish gains, I told him I loved him, and I broke his heart when I got tired of living the lie. I look around and I see myself in his shoes. I'm scared of a lot of things, and I have nobody that I trust completely. 

I think more than anything I'm scared of not feeling. I think I feel one way for my boyfriend, but do I really? I question myself at every turn, how do I know what love feels like? I don't even know how he feels about me, how can I tell myself I feel this way about him? I don't want to be hurt like I hurt my old boyfriend. I'm scared that I'm getting karma back from the things I did and said to him.

I've never trusted my family, but those issues are deep, and I won't be getting into them here. Suffice to say, I've always looked for someone I could trust and confide in, and haven't truly found someone yet. I've had extremely good friends, but nobody that I've been able to tell all my secrets to. I have some pretty dark ones that even I have trouble thinking about. I don't know if I'll ever find someone I can confide those in. After everything that's happened this year, I'm having trouble letting people in and giving them a chance. I'm suspicious of almost everyone I know, and I hate that it's like that. I want to trust people so bad, but I don't want to be hurt. I know everyone has to deal with this, but I'm terrified of it. I fear that one day I'll wake up and nobody will remember my name, or ignore me completely. 

I have a boyfriend, and yet I still feel alone. I have friends, and yet I still feel alone. I feel 5 years old again. I need someone to take me in their arms and tell me it's going to be ok."

"event","I love all aspects of music. If I could have something playing in the background for the rest of my life, I'd be a happy little girl. I took piano for almost 4 years, and did choir and other musical endeavors in high school, so my understanding of music is quite good. I love listening to a piece of classical music, and hearing different chord progressions, or listen to modern singers carry out beautiful melodies. If I'm driving alone, its entirely possible that I'll be belting my heart out to whatever is on the radio. My sister and I are notorious for trying to best each other while in the car, and when we were younger, we would fight over who got to sing what part of a song. I usually took the background harmony, because it was much more difficult, and I loved hearing how my voice could blend in harmony with the lead vocals. 

I heard an amazing young musician tonight. It makes me a little bit jealous when I see people who just have talent like that, but at the same time I'm so happy to be able to hear such great music. I'm such a fan of his, and he dedicated one of his songs to me, which was really awesome. I won't say that I 'discovered' him, because he's not like famous or anything, but I like to think that I helped spread his music out to a lot of people. Its weird how much younger he is than me, but how much more mature and experienced he is than I am.

Music has always been the thing that helps me get through things. I can just put on my favorite CD, relax, and all my stress seems to melt away. I constantly leave my iTunes on in my room here, and sometimes I have it play soft music all night. When I lived at home and would fight with my parents, I'd run up to my room in tears, grab my Walkman and just play the loudest, most hard-rock CD I had, and let it be my catharsis, instead of me punching a wall as I tended to do sometimes. I usually am an extremely mellow person, but only because I drain out my worries and stress in music. I used to have my keyboard/piano here at school, but I broke the chord, so I had to take it home. I would play that thing almost daily down here, and now that I can't, I have trouble getting certain pieces of music out of my head. When I had the keyboard, I would just play it until I got tired of it, but now it just gets stuck there. I can literally see the notes on a page in my head of what I'd play. Its really crazy. 

I like to think that I can sing. I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm horrible, just nobody has the heart to tell me. I see it on American Idol all the time. Moms just tell their kids that they're awesome, but really they suck at life. I hope I'm not like that."

"event","Its a weird emotion, love. In my speech class last week, we had to do impromptu speeches, and one guy had the topic, ""What is love?"" All he could talk about were <i>things</i> that he loved, like his shoes, his hat, his pants, etc. I doubt he's really materialistic, but it gives more credit to my new theory on why guys have trouble expressing emotions, especially love. Not saying that they <i>all</i> have this trouble, I know a few very expressive guys who are comfortable talking about their feelings, but on the whole a great percentage of guys just can't muster the words to say how they feel about people that they care about. My theory is that its engrained into boys in this country, repress your feelings, don't show them to anyone or you'll get called a sissy. I got this idea from my Child Development class last month, and I think it's really sad. Boys are born with a greater capacity to express emotions and feelings, but they have to spend their whole forming years being told not to feel anything but anger and pride. Then they get into relationships and can't tell their significant other how they feel about them.

My first boyfriend expressed his emotions well. A few months into our relationship, he told me that he loved me. I was 16 and naive, so I said I loved him back. I did not love him, and lying about it is one of the things that I'll regret until the end of my days. I doomed any hope of our relationship from the moment the lie escaped my lips, because I knew consciously that I didn't love him.  I liked him a lot, and I cared about him, but I didn't love him. Its one of the worst situations to be put in, and I'm sure it happens more often to guys than to girls. What are you supposed to say to ""I love you""? If you don't say it back, you're screwed, and if you say it back but don't mean it, you're doubly screwed in the end. I'm never going to say ""I love you"" when I don't mean it again. Its one of the cruelest things you can do to someone else emotionally, and I already can't forgive myself for doing it one time. 

I know exactly how I feel about my boyfriend right now, but I won't put him into the situation that my first boyfriend put me into. If my boyfriend says he loves me, I want it to be because he actually does, not simply saying it back because I say it. In the short run, I might be satisfied, but to find out down the road that he never loved me would be much worse than just not saying ""I love you"" back.

I feel bad saying this, but one of the reasons I'm still in touch with my first boyfriend is because of what I did to him. I guess I feel the need to atone for what I've done. I don't think I could have broken up with him at a worse time in his life, and I thank God that he's still intact. I don't presume to think that I'm so great that my very presence, or lack thereof, would be enough to affect someone, but I know that he was in love with me. Even if he doesn't agree, I feel like I owe him for all the pain I put him through. He's not bad as a friend, which is what we are right now, and hopefully we'll stay friends for awhile.

Love is an emotion that I still don't understand completely. I think it will take being in love with someone mutually for me to really ""get it."""

"event","Sleep is entirely underrated. A good night's sleep can do wonders for you, and I know because I haven't gotten a good night's rest in well over a week and I'm really hurting for it. I think a lot of my potential is lost when I can't get a full night's sleep. Its a paradox where if I had less to do, I'd be able to do more, but since I have more to do, I'm actually able to accomplish less.

Professors can either be really mean or really nice before the end of the semester and finals. There is no in-between on this one. They're either super nice about it, and give you time off at the end or have more relaxed lectures scheduled for the last week of classes, or they don't really care and throw a large test in the week before your final. This semester I have a mix of both kinds of professors, and I have to say that I prefer the nice ones. Not that I mind tests, I actually do quite well on them, its the increased study time that I mind. Eats up precious time that I could be going out, studying for another final, or sleeping.

I've started to play this really fun game with my friends. I let them ask me any three questions they want about me, and I answer as honestly as I possibly can. Three questions. No more, no less. (Except my boyfriend, he gets unlimited questions, but that's besides the point) Its actually made me think a lot, because some of them are asking really tough ones. I laugh when they ask my favorite color, or silly things like that, because they're missing a great opportunity to delve inside who I am with detail, which I don't often do. I encourage you to have your friends ask you three questions, because not only would they learn something about you that they never knew before, you might learn something about yourself as well. I know I have."

"event","I had a lovely time today with an incredible guy. My boyfriend of now two weeks is great, and we've been good friends for almost five years. Now we're together, and its changed everything and nothing between us. 

Its funny how comfortable you can be with someone so quickly. Its been two weeks, and I've probably spent only a few days of it with him. He goes to school over two hours away from me, and he'll be going to school through the summer because he's on a year-round program. Means that I only get to spend the weekends with him, but I don't mind all that much. 

Everyone keeps telling me that I should be sad about being far away from him, and while I am, its not really all that bad of a thing when you think about it. I've seen people in great relationships end up hating each other because they spend every waking minute together. He's far enough away that I miss him, and I'm excited to see him when he comes home, but he's close enough to where if I need to talk to him, I can just call. 

Long-distance relationships take quite a bit of work, and I give respect to those who can pull them off. I know that many people can't, and I think its due in large part to the experience of college. Long-distance relationships that are also one's first relationship <i>really </i> take a lot of work, and most are doomed from their inception, but I'll most definitely get into that subject later. I don't think the majority of people out there are capable of doing a long-distance relationship, because in America we're raised to want the maximum results with the minimum amount of work possible. Sorry, but that doesn't apply to relationships.

This is my first post about relationships, and I can guarantee with certainty that it shall not be the last. I've had my fair share of dealings, and I'm not afraid to let you all learn from my mistakes."

"event","Here is what the National Education Association
has to say about the No Child Left Behind Act.

http://www.nea.org/esea/

It is true that Kerry voted for the Act, but that was before he knew Bush would renege on millions of dollars in funding.
Bush's plan, without sufficient funding will push our education system toward a privatized education institution. This would
a. put low income families at a severe disadvantage, more than they already are.
b.Give teachers a less secure job future.
c.a lot more, but i need to go to class 

If you are going to teach, look more into this stuff. Don't take the guarantee of a job in public schools for granted."

"event","The republican party's favorite criticism of Kerry is that he is a ""flip-flopper,"" because he has changed his mind. The world is not black and white like the republicans think it is. Issues are complicated and someone does not have to be only for, or only against an issue. People can support parts of an issue or disagree with parts of an issue, but the Bush administration seems to be too simple minded to comprehend, or are too devious to admit that.
There are times when a person says one thing and does another, which is more underhanded and untruthful than ""flip-flopping"". Bush is wonderful at saying one thing and doing another, and here is a great web cite listing tons of examples.

"event","When Bush took office Unemployment was the lowest in more than 10 years. More than two million less people have jobs now than when Bush took office

MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE

The population of the state of Nevada is roughly how many people have lost jobs.

Unemployment 
http://data.bls.gov/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?request_action=wh&graph_name=LN_cpsbref2

Many of these jobs are being exported overseas, to places like India and China. Companies do this so they can pay their workers less and so they do not have to abide by the United States environmental standards. If it were up to Bush he would get rid of all the Environmental standards, and keep minimum wage as low as possible. This would make our large companies more competitve, but middle-class and low income families would suffer greatly. Instead we need to pressure countries like India and China to set up better environmental standards, and force American companies to their pay foreign workers more, so that they might decide just to keep jobs at home. Through tax breaks we need to encourage more companies to keep jobs in the U.S. 
I don't think Bush can do any of this"

"event","On February 15, 2000 the South Carolina Republican debate was held on Larry King Live. 

KING: So if a state were voting on gay marriage, you would suggest to that state not to approve it?

BUSH: The state can do what they want to do. Don't try to trap me in this state's issue like you're trying to get me into.

to read the whole debate...
http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0002/15/lkl.00.html

Bush clearly says he would let states do what it wants when it came to the gay marriage issue. Now Bush is supporting a constitutional Amendment that would make Gay marriage illegal. He flip-flopped. Changing the constitution this way in itself would be unconstitutional.

Amendments of the constitution-
Article [I.] (See Note 13) 
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. 

Notice the first line. Bush wants to tell Churches who they can marry and who they can't marry. This is not right.

My opinion; Marriage should not be controlled by the government at all, only by churches. The state should give civil unions, with the same rights as marriage has now, to both hetero and homosexual couples. This would mean equal rights for everyone. Then churches can decide if their religion permits gay marriage or not. Bush is not God."

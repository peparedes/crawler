Katherine is pissed at me cuz she tells me i don't listen to her. but sometimes its hard to recall all of the info she tells me. i am proud that she had a good day though...but she probably won't listen to me. i don't like to talk...but when i wanna she doesn't wanna listen, ya sometimes she asks ""do you wanna talk"" but thats when i don't wanna.. i need to feel like she always is about to ask me that question...just in case i need her...and i used to feel that way all the time (despite what she thinks). but now i feel like she never wants to talk...cuz the last couple times i have wanted to talk to her...she has just pushed me away...or kept talking when i try to interrupt and tell her my story of my good day or my bad day. today was a bad day. and i used to feel that i could explain to her how bad my day was...but now she isn't talking to me...or listening.

                                                       she'll get over it... i hope."

"event","I hate Valentine's day!!!!!!!!! it is like the worst holiday ever invented. why was it invented anyway?? if people want to show their love for someone else, then why can't they show it on any other day?? why do we have to make it an acctuall holiday?? o well, i can't always get my way. 

the reason why i hate valentine's day so much started in 5th grade. i got a secret admierer note in my locker. it took me the entire year to figure it out. i was sooo pissed. other kids might be latterd by getting one of those notes, but not me i guess i am just kinda weird that way.  and ten last year.... don't get me started on last year . i got a carnation from a secret admierer but i knew who it was from. it was soo disgusting cuz the kid is disgusting and ewww just tooo terrible to talk about.     and finally this year, it had nothing to do with school this time = ) so i won't have to face him every day, just on sundays at church. there's this kid who lives in a different city, he goes to my church.  and i kinda had a crush on him but no one knew but kayla (but she never met him).  well i kinda figured out a while ago that he kinda likes my sister. but i though well hes my age so i still have a better chance than she does. but ooo was i wrong. we went to this lamo dance on friday for goya, it was soo stupid. my two friends (colleen and the kid) were hanging out with katheriine the entire time,the were just in the little hallway talking on her phone.  i looked like a total looser cuz when i got bored  of them and decided to sit down in one of the chais on the wall (alone). so the kid left and then we were soo bored that we called my mom and left. i was almost in tears because in my minutes sitting on the wall alone, i did a lot of thinking, and i figured out that no mtter how much she dennys it, katherine likes him. and he likes her so there is no point in trying anymore. so now i am not talking to katherine (wich is really hard cuz we live in the same house). and i am trying to think of anything but what has happened. 

that is why this was the worst valentine's day ever. because my broken heart couldn't take another minute of this over rated hallmark holiday."

"event","Ok today i had to skip dance because of my ankle =o( i think i hurt it when i tripped over kayla and twisted it. i think its no big deal but my mom thinks there is a problem with one of my tendons??? i don't get it. 

the good part was that i got to go to the girls varsity b-ball game last nite!!! we won by like 20 points. i was sitting with like christine v., ashley, megan, teagan, allie, amanda, hannah, colleen and devyn. they all seemed to like my phone so i spent most of the game trying to figure out who had it. then allie's grandpa came by adn was like ""hey i have one of those shirts"" i was like laughing cuz he was like showing her off to all of his friends. it made me wish my grandfather was still allive. but the shirt was one of those melorse red raider's superfan shirts from my sister. i was like all ""go melrose"" with my tee shirt and melrose pants. and the exciting news was that i finally was able to bend my ankle enough to have it flat on the ground. i was wicked excited so i practicly ran over to tell christine and then it started to hurt again. 

o well it'll get better soon. my mom is going to make me go to the docters. i HATE  the docters. i am dead serious, i hate it with a passion. o my god. ya im going to go though. like it was hurting during gym and after class (keyword AFTER) i asked miss readon if i could have a pass to go to the nurse before the bell and she was like ""did it happen during gym"" i was like no but it hurts and she said that she couldn't write me a pass cuz it didn't happen in gym. i was soooooooo pissed. o well."

I went to jordans furnature too. haha that place scared me its the new one in reading. it wasn't as much scary as it was overwelming. i mean it was soo noisy and crowded it wasn't even funny. we couoldn't like have any fun cuz my yiayia was with us and she was like all work. like she dragged us rite away to see her new couch so she could order it. and then she thought she canged her mind on a fabrick for her chair, but she liked the original best so it was a waist of like half an hour. we ate at like 1:30 and it was at this really crouded and yiayia was saying how cute it was and all that crap. it got very annoying after she repeated herself many times.    the fireworks (liquid ones) kinda scared me cuz they were soooo loud when they crashed. people say that they are soo amazing because they are to music, but they aren't even on time with the music.i deffinatley don't get it.

"event","Well it's almost the new year! i really hope this year is better then last. i mean.. the new year is better then this year. whatever. but ya a lot of things have to change in order for this to be a good year.                one) katherine must change we were like best friends when we were little then we hated eachother but after the summer we talked more and more  because it helped us we used to say how we didn't wanna talk to paula because she wouldn't listen, she wouldn't want to. but now she would rather talk to paula and that gets me really pissed. she gets clingy like to my cousins, does eveythikng that they  do just so they think she is cooler. she thinks she needs more attention and thats why she is doing stupid stuff but i think she should be herself and not an annying litle pain and she won't be ""forgotten"" like she thinks she will be and she won't be hated. o ya she also has to get friends her own age and stop stealing paula's they only feel bad for her and if she talks to them ""cuz the are the only people who understand her"" she should get a clue and realize ya they are listening  but there is nothing they can do to help more than family.              two) paula should start caring more about her sisters and family then about her friends and people who she thinks are her freinds who just do stuff behind her back and use her to make them look innocent and so they get away with more stuff.hmm ya i think thats it for her.        and three) i need to be a little less hard on them because i am not perfect and they probably have stuff to say about me too. 
i know it is a hard time for all of us and  i need them but sometimes they just aren't there. well more then sometimes more like all the time. i know we would never desert eachother or anyhting but we still aren't close and someday we will want to be together but it will be imposible and thats why we should take advantege of the time we have together now. i wish they would realize this. if they did i wouldnt have to type this i could tell them how i feel instead of telling everyone except them."

"event","well today was christmas and i feel like crap.
it started yesterday cuz that was ""the hartigan christmas eve"" wich is all the hartigans and this year it was at my house.
i thought that was a silly idea cuz our blood relation to the hartigans is gane so we really don't have a rite to have christmas eve at our house. but it was sad cuz my uncle who has never shown any emotion like ever almost started crying the minute he walked in the door. and then my other uncle started laughing and his voice got kinda high and i jumped cuz it sounded like my dad's laugh, ""the girly laugh"", he even looks almots identicle to my dad too.

then this morning my mom was crying when she explained to us why she bought us buterflt braceltts. she said tht life is like the stages of a butterfly, and in life, we are the catipillar, and when we die and go to heaven, we are a butterfly, so dad is a butterfly.
then at breakfast my mom rememberd it was my name day so then she announced it and made my cousins jump up hold me down and pull my ears as hard as they could. (greek tradition)
but later we were a yiayia's house and we had great conversations but when the room got quiet we all knew what eachother was thinking about.

Huh? oh well i guess i have some stuff to work on. but the thing is, i hate talking to people. ya you mite find that strange but I can't even like talk to my aunt about how school was. that's why i like having friends like mine, cuz they do all the talking. but people say the best thing you can do is talk to some one even a perfect stranger. i hate when people say that. i can make up my own mind when it comes to who i talk to, what its about, and when i do it, and i don't need them to tell me whats rite.

Its laura's birthday, and we were in tech ed and she dumped a whole big thing of sawdust on someone. he tried to get her back but she grabbed the bathroom pass sceamed ""I have to go"" and sprinted out of the room to get away from him and he followed her. ahh so funny.  also in that class, there is one of the girliest guys in 7th grade. some kids were kinda fighting like lightly punching and he started to make it into a real cat fight like standing back  and slapping them it looked sooo funny! Mr. D still doesn't know kayla's name, I told her she really sould wear a name tag theat he could see from the front of the room. it worked for me.

And why did I have to be walking in the same direction, about 10 feet behind her, for like 5 minutes without realizing she was there, speaking very loudly and very offensively to Shelley. Oh god the awkwardness it burns."

"event","To the person in the room next to mine: SHUT YOUR FUCKING ALARM CLOCK OFF.

Every morning at 7. It beeps for at least 20 minutes. It might not wake her up but it wakes me up. It is right next to my wall annd the walls here are thin. I'm pretty sure she is in the room but just isn't waking up to the damn alarm.

And now. At 1:14am. It has going off for almost 20 minutes. Why do they make alarm clocks that beep for a half hour? Most shut off at a certain point but if you don't wake up after 5 minutes of beeping you aren't going to get up. 

I am going to have to bitch at this kid. This is too much.

EDIT: After 50 minutes of listening to the damn thing beep I knocked on the door (it took a few tries to get anyone to answer) and the girl who had apparently been sleeping with the lights on finally woke up and shut her alarm clock off. She said ""oh.. I've been really tired lately."" Well yea you're up all night listening to music and lauging really loudly no wonder you're tired. Btw, the alarm clock actually is right up against the wall that my bed is on."

I'm going to get checked out tommorow and hopefully I don't have whooping cough and I'll be able to get whatever random shots Dartmouth thinks I need to leave the country.

 Since the last time I was sick was last year, the strange, delerious, ""holy crap I'm sick"" feeling is making me kind of homesick. I remember all the times in high school I took days off and slept all day and messed around on my computer. Which oddly enough is actually what I do almost every weekend anyway is college. 

Room Draw went well. I'm living in a nice 3 room tripple with 2 friends and I'm in the single and their in the double. It has a nice sized common room even though its a strange curved shape. It's actually the room right below the room I'm in this year. 

The gleek party wasn't as ragey as I thought it was going to be, but I still got back really late because I went to Amarna to play Guitar Hero (randomess). Probably wasn't a good idea but I managed to get a lot of sleep today anyway...

Tommorow is EW room draw but it's during the gleek concert so I have to get a proxy to choose my room for me.

"event","Yay I'm back on campus but now I'm sick. And I thought I was going to be able to not get sick until at least the winter (but I guess it's winter here...)

So I have a psych final and a japanese final on the 5th. And I have my final essay for my seminar due on the 7th. And I need to get my rewrites in by tommorow. I really need to do them right now but I'm not. Instead I'm writing meaningless crap on LJ. Yay internet. I think I'll blame the lack of motivation on my cold. 

Handel Society concert was decent. The choir is pretty bad but the orchestra was great and the songs were good. 

I'll be home on the 7th which is... 8 days from now. So for all you losers still working at school expect me to come visit."

"event","I love thanksgiving because I get to eat poppy seed cake. Yea, yea, make as many opium jokes as you want. Poppy seed cake is still amazing. Mmmmm.... turkey, cranberry sauce, and poppy seed cake-- a wonderful thanksgiving tradition. 

Visiting Megan's dorm at Columbia made me appreciate my dorm so much. Her room looks like a prison. I love East Wheelock. 

I visited JP and it still sucks. Nothing changed except the lockers and the yearbook room. I'm going to visit again over winter break so I can crash a choir rehearsal (because you know how much I love high scool choir!). I am so happy to be out of that fucked up place. 

It is kind of weird being home. It doesn't really feel like I've been gone for too long but I'm in this strange transition between my dorm and my house being ""home"". Ah well in another 2 weeks I'll be back in Edison again anyway... 

Happy thanksgiving."

It's good to be back."

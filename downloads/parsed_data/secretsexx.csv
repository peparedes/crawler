Such a horrible horrible feeling, it's really a shame that no matter how much you will love someone this emotion will still hunt you down and make you sick to your stomach; and the worst part of it is you always come out thinking why me? What have I done to deserve this? 

While the truth in the matter is that I have done nothing wrong to deserve this it will always bring up these questions and a waterfall of emotions that are triggered with hearing something so innocent as just her name. 

I'm not an insecure person I'm really not so how does it still get the best of me? It's the one thing that is holding me back from truly being happy with him and will have such a massive strain if I can't overcome it. So, in all it's bitter darkness; all I really want; is for her to go away. Leave us in peace so that I can remain; all the time... blissfully happy."

"event","After losing my best friend to the most bullshit religion of all ""Christianity"" I got to thinking how the hell did she buy into all that crap. I'd understand if she had decided to take the path of another religion such as hinduism or something like that because at least she would actually have rules to follow and she would be testing herself and proving that she actually has some belief in the code. But fuck, Christianity? Christianity is the biggest bullshit religion known to man, it's almost as if the ten commandments are covered in loop holes and exceptions, and if you think about it despite the 'thou shalt not's' there is not one sin that you won't be promised forgiveness for. Most people only turn to it after they've commited a sin, no man should be forgiven after killing and raping an innocent child, no man should be forgiven after snatching the purse of an old lady befor beating her to the ground, these people don't deserve forgiveness they deserve to be punished, to be beaten, to be banished! Three fold.

I really had to laugh when She told me that she only wanted to join the church as she ""felt a sense if belonging, that these people are like her family."" If these people were you're family they would know everything about you they would have been there when you needed a shoulder to cry on, when you felt the weight of the world on your shoulders and just when you about to give it all in you're best friend would come along and lighten the load. If you already have 100 million dollar friends why would you want a new family? Why won't you listen to the people around you that actually care and can see that you're only being brainwashed, the people who actually see how persistant the church has become from knocking on doors to midnight phone calls and the hundred thousand pamphlets that clutter your mailbox everyday, how full of shit you've actually become. And all that crap is actually coming from the one person who actually once said the very true words ""once a cynic, always a cynic""."

"event","So I've recently been asked to travel across country to go spend a weekend with A1??? I know this will most probably end in disaster but the euphoric naive side of me likes to believe otherwise, so as always on impulse, I said yes. Hopefully this isn't some kind of bear trap, an oppurtunity where his evil little smile can get me all buttered up and vulnerable then throw me away, stomp on me, then spit me back into the gutter where i so knowingly deserve to be.

But you know what, I think I've felt the worst so fuck it, I'll take the risk and he does plan on punishment, at least I know I deserved it anyway and I'll be finally given a moment of pure, heated honest aggression that I've been craving just to know where i really stand.

I can't help but hope that maybe my judgement isn't that good and that he actually wants me there for some reason other than revenge, god I would give anything to be more trusting, things would be so much easier. If I trusted him in the first place I would never have put him and myself through this big mess, but no, I knew that the only way to save myself from all the drama was to turn myself into the coldest, hardest, brickwall of a person and find away to drive him away before anyone got hurt and it wasn't even as if he gave me a reason to not trust him in the first place anyway. Great plan, huh!

But in my europhic state, I just hope everything's zen, because I now know that I won't settle for anything less than butterflies. Ok so it may have been that feeling that had me running for the hills to begin with, but, I guess now with a little perspective, I've learnt to stomach them. And god, if we can survive an entire weekend with eachother, we'll be like war buddies."

In the midst of being so insanely bored I have found myself wondering this ""Why do people admit to wanting to be in a relationship even if they don't know who with?"", forgive me if I'm mistaken but isn't a relationship just an excuse for someone to come along and band-aid your own emotional issues. Is that really how dependant we've come so much so that we can't even heal our own broken hearts, that we need the help of a perfect stranger to do it for us? And if this be the case, those relationships don't last so we're right back we started."

I don't think i've had so many fucking delinquents on the other end of the phone.. ever. I know I'm in no place place to pass judgement granted I have bumped into every possible sharp edge door handle or doorway in this office today (and I think all that knocking about has loosened a little screw in my head too) but I have been here since 8am and still haven't made any attempt at actual work.

Maybe that blazed after effect of the weekend is finally catching up with me, granted it was worth it though I did have a lot of fun, perhaps maybe a little too much but on the contrary is too much really ever enough? 

Saturday morning was fun, got home on after friday night drinks just to stay up and watch Roswell followed by few hours sleep and a champagne and chocolate eclair breakfast at Hot Chocolate with N as we were feeling deliciously gluttonous and still both a little drunk. A lot of giggles and some talk of the of the boys were ineviatable . I love being around N she's one of the few girls I  know who share my belief to wabt to celebrate for no particular reason at all being young and careless is reason enough (as horribly cliched as that just sounded)

K's party was as expected in true K style she had invited around 100 of her closest acquintances, granted she was only in it for the presents and we, the free drinks but a good time was had by all. Apparently I had such a good time that I accepted an offer to get in a car and go to a club with R (turrns out not such an asshole afterall, who knew?), that's where things to an unexpected turn (and probably best to keep that kind infomation to myself) but I did wake up the  next in dire need of a slurpie and to 10 text messages and about 20 missed calls from R hoping I'd got home ok (hmmm... sweet. Poor thing never called him backed though).

Went to mums and forgot how much I missed  the obligatory sunday bacons and egg breakfast we used to have, did some washing and had a little nap in my old room, God I miss it (especially that fact the it's so dark that when the blinds are closed a slightly tipsy person could mistake night for day). Which reminds me, I have to tell C my plans for going back there, that is something I'm not looking forward too.

Later that afternoon a more refreshed, awake but still completely out of touch version of me met J at Rics for a beer and a fag (well two fags at least)to discuss plans of eloping together this weekend. 
Which leads me here, monday afternoon and aboslutely no work done today and fuck, i just bumped into another door handle.

This is getting ridiculous I'got to go it's now three o'clock and still no tasks accomplished, I feel silly rambling on like this so I'm ending it here."

But no matter how much beer, laughter and cigarettes were involved I can't shake the feeling that something isn't right, I've just this weird feeling that I've really fucked something up and no sunday afternoon spent at rics will cure that.

However, what will cure both of us, J believes, is a weekend of house sitting his boys parents house somewhere far far away near the land of Malaney. It's nice to know I have my safety net back, that is until his boyfriend gets  back at least anyway. 

Just thought of escaping to a place where we can have completely differnat names and be completely differant people even if it just is for that weekend is just what I need to indulge in everything and escape all of the bullshit people.

Not sure if J is still up to take a trip down memory lane with a little substance abuse but one thing is certain it will be one of thoes great trips where the details will be hard to remember, but impossible to forget."

I'm scared i'll wind up just a boring nine to five admin girl, with no life and no fun friends. (Granted I know that will never ever happen, but thought is scary and enough to make me want to do something about it). So I have decided to pack my bags and jetset off to england. How long will I be gone, well indefinately i guess, for as long as it's fun. If there's ever a time to really live it's now, no responsibilities, no restrictions, I don't want to get stuck in that situation of working just to live rather than working towards something bigger. It's funny cause i've tried to convice other people to come and althought ey are so keen of the idea they emotionally can unattach themselves from the non-existant lives they're about to lead if they just sit here and do nothing about it. 

Is it bad of me to want to leave tommorow if I could, to pack up and say goodbye my friends and family in the reality that I may not be back for a few years, could I finaly leave a certain someone in the past and erase him from my memory completely or would that just make me miss him more?

Whether or not he will have an effect on me in uncertain but what is certain is that nothing will affect my decision, I'm leaving and not because i'm running away from anything. not at all, I'm leaving because I need an adventure, I can't just sit and work my life away, now ay is that for me I just want to have fun and party and meet interesting people make memories that are worth publishing, that's why i'm leaving in case anyone's wondering"

"event","My Morning work  routine usually goes along the lines off arriving at 8.30 turn on my computer, make coffee, read emails (personal and profesional), read daily horoscope, do a little internet shopping, try not to get caught, some more coffee, more reading and writing of the emails, lunch.

So yesterday I was plesantly suprised to see my ninemsn horoscope had three sunnydays, Everything seemed to be in order and my outlook for the day had been predicted, perfect. 

My lovescope read something along the lines of I will run into or accidently get into contact with someone whom I knew quite a long time ago but didn't have to much of a romantic impact on my life until now, this person was just someone to fill in time and I moved on quickly but this time it will be differant I will be smitten.

Then abracadabra, and the notorious text message appears on my screen. ""What the?"" it was K. K was a guy with a girlfriend whom I shared a rather infamous and exploitable fling with but realised was a tool after he lied to me about her, apparently they hadn't broken up. Granted I didn't see him very much after that. 

Quite confused I replied with a ""what the?"".
""You sent me a blank text this morning, but how have you been anyway I miss you""
In normal  circumstances I would have left it at that but I was bedazzled by the stars and it only seemed destined to reply
""Sorry my phone must've been unlocked rolling around in the bottom of my bag, I've been good, how about you, hey do you want to go get a drink or something sometime""
""Yeah sounds good, some night next week.""

I left it there, I definately know that I won't ever let myself get into hot water but deep down I hope he'd broken up with his girlfriend for her sake, she's too sweet of a girl for him to deserve and I, well I need to close the deal.

In a vein vein hope I really hope he has changed his lying cheating ways because we really did have fun and despite the bullshit he is a nice guy but let's say hypothetically that he had I don't think I'd ever be able to trust him as much as I like too, I'm way to defensive for that, either that or he wants to somehow make it up to me and prove himself and I the brick wall that I can be, decide that while trapped in my charm I will be the one to finally give him the sweet taste of his own medicine that he once gave her.

God I hate to hear myself talk like that again but I guess as the prophecy goes every act will come back three fold.

Hey but on a lighter note the rest of my day was perfect, made pretty pictures on my computer, went to the bottleshop, had many smiles from passing strangers it could possibly have been that every person i came into close proximaty of was just floating along on a cloud. Shared a bottle of wine and a joint under the stars with C from the comfort of our own verandah, listen to some great music and danced happily to bed for some much needed undisturbed sleep, ah what a lovely day."

"event","What could quite possibly be the weirdest thing to happen during the day just took place while i was do a bakery run at work.

I was standing at the top of my street, waiting for the light to appear so i could cross when i noticed a well dressed business man looking through the tinted glass of the cab to my right, I didn't take much notice of the man and as the light turned green I continued on to cross the road while he drove up the street. Only to stop at the next corner and race up behind me. 
""Excuse me"", I thought shit here we go, some bum wants money again, I turned around to my shock, ""I'm sorry, but you are absolutely gorguess can i give you my number, you could give me a call sometime"".
I politey declined ""I'm sorry, no""
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, sorry, I'm quite sure""

I don't know what came over me this man was quite attractive a little older than me, but looked very good none the less, but funnily enough my horoscope scope today read ""You will receive an offer that will be to good to be true"". Either that or everything happened to quickly and I was caught completely off guard, it was some kind of defence mechanism I've developed from too many random strangers stepping too close beside me on the street, afterall this is the valley.

But wow, i feel a little flattered, mostly freaked out, is that what we've come down to these days? So hungry for sex that we are literally jumping out of cabs in the middle of the street to meet women."

So I called J, J is the token male gay friend that is the single girls safety net. These are very popular friends to treasure for more reasons than any other because a. You can never worry of being hit on by them; b. You you will never ruin the friendship by sleeping with them; c. you don't feel bad about wanting their friends as more often than not you're encouraged; d. you get secret inside information about the opposite species and lastly e. No mixed messages!

Although Jon doesn't know A1 he is more than happy to relate with me in a not so faggy way, he'll be straight with me (funny choice of words) but will still lie for the well being of my own protection. No matter how absurd the situation the gay best friend is always willing to put themselves on the line for you and get caught up in all the drama, even if it is only for the love of the theater."

I lean in to him and kiss him a lingering kiss while his mouth lay numb and speechless, it was what neither of us expected but desired so badly for so long. 

He kissed me back, locked in this moment and with one hand on my thigh he pulled me onto him, he sat upright while his hands almost the same width of my back slid up and with a shiver, I'd finally given in. He gently removed my dress and lifted over my head and i fiercly ripped the shirt off his back every movement made was insync with eachothers interlocked bodies it is as if we are made to fit, like two missing pieces of a puzzle we are so smooth so alive. No matter how I try  to fight I can't cool down as his adventurous hands scout the next warm place to hide and pulled the lace of my knickers to one side as my lips graze his neck and i'm enclosed in his wide shoulders. 


My wirey fingers try to unbutton his pants but my entire bosdy goes weak as he reaches around my neck and i drag my lips from under his teeth. My fingernails lightly scratch at the fabric and pull hard at the elastic until I have him straddled completely naked underneath and inside me. 

Thrown onto my back both hands my slide up my entire body my arms up over my head and my grip so strong in his I feel I could almost lift his weight above me as he drove me so hard into the mattress and each time he came his muscular spasms ripped straight through me like a soundwave, setting off my own alarms starting an orgasm from the inside, out."

Just so I could get some kind of heated physical and emotional passion from him.

I thought I was over him and any kind of chance i could have ever had to wake up there is long gone, i'd thoughti had accepted that. Hypothetically if I was ever given a second chance, I wouldn't take it, for me to warm to him would be a disaster amoung epic proportions. 

Maybe in some kind of dark fucked up kind of way I like the danger and the idea of being able to enter some unchartedred territory, risking the biggest thing of all... my heart, could it possibly get broken, am i secretly willing to put  it in his hands because all i really want is to be fucked. Afterall, I did fuck him over first it's only fair to let him lay his vengeful hands on me."

3. The thought of many of my exes. (D2)
4. A Family member and any sort of sexual connotation used in the same sentence.

6. The smell of parmesan cheese (despite the fact that i absolutely adore the taste)
7. Any sort of violence to animals 
8. Myself
9. The fact that my boss is having a child, don't get me wrong here i adore the man but sometimes you just wish that babies actually came from the stalk you know.
10. Grasshoppers - despite being attackde by a wild bear of swimming in shark infested waters the most terrifying thing would without a doubt be big brown grasshoppers or getting caught in the firing line when a swarm of locusts wipe out an entire harvest, that is what scares me the most. (Refrain Yourself)

10 Things that Give Me Butterflies.
1. Good First Impressions ( aka. someone who stands out in a crowded room)
2. Bakeries
3. Knowing I'm dong something that I shouldn't be and the risk of being caught is so high.
4. Movies with Predictable Endings
5. Prison Break
6. Danger and Risk Taking
7. Hearing my favourite song on the Radio 
8. Aeroplanes
9. The thought of MF who could quite possibly the most attractive man on the earth. (Unfortunately the butterflies are sooned diminished witht he afterthought. see ""10 Things that make my stomach turn no.5"")

"event","Yesterday afternoon, enjoying a quiet train ride home from work a dull middle aged man (desperately in need of a ""neck massage"") sitting across from me, caught a slither of lace that was wrapped around the top of my stocking (very similar to that of the picture) that revealed itself ever so slightly as I crossed one leg over the other in a ladylike manner, he had thhis discreet sort of smile that almost made stomach turn so in defense I quickly pulled on the hem of my dress, rolled my eyes and darted them in another direction. 

But in that instant I thought to myself how sad is it that a barely twenty - something girl could posess so much power that if she was to abuse could get her almost anything she wanted (Granted it could also get her into a lot of trouble but it is a nice thought). It is however, the first time in the history of this city where women have as much money and power as men and (thanks to our good fried Samantha Jones) the equal oppurtunity of using men as sex objects."

"event","I am blessed... literally, I agreed to do C a favour which would result in being rewarded to a nice day at the beach. The favour being that despite all my religous disbeliefs and cynicism I would go to Sunday Service with her, it's not as though I don't believe in the bible and all that, I do, I don't however believe in it being forced upon people (this might I add should never be said to a manic believer no matter how passionate you are about it, they will always be more passionate and opinionated that it's best left alone altogether).

God forgive me for what I'm about to say but I honestly believe that Cs new journey to enlightenment is kind of bullshit, I hate to say it but we both know the only reason she's there is because she's completely in love with MM whom is a member of the church and while she has convinced herself that it's not about him at all, I see right through it. It's sad but true so in support of her I went with her to the service she felt insecure and I felt like the biggest phony. 

It wasn't at all like I expected it was as close to a Karoke bar as it possibly could've been so I was pleasantly suprised at the idea of getting out of my seat to sing hallululah, I was a bit scared but definately lightened up when we got into the gospel, I can now understand wahy so many of the great singers learnt to sing in church, am definately going to miss that.

And although they were open to first timers I was in no way there for forgiveness or to begin somekind of journey I was their plain and simply to help a friend in dire need of some confidence. But it frustrates me with anger that even with me by her side she still didn't have the courage to go and talk to him, I've tried to warn her that if she keeps acting like this she is going to give him the wrong idea (and not in a good way) but she prevails and drowns herself in her insecurities and I get so angry to think that she could be so blind, M is so taken by her if only she could see the look on his face when she entered the room, he was blown away and literally had to gasp for air. 

Defintely not shy of showing his affection MM has tried to include her in as much of his life as possible and she just brushes it off with the excuse that it's his job to bring new people into the church, well that's bullshit! He knows he would be lucky to have her, it just makes me so  angry that such beauty, grace, sex appeal and power could be so wasted.

Forgive me father for getting a little hot in my seat but you did place a very sexy twenty something infront of me
is that so terrible tha i fancied one of MMs friends, he was also a worker there but i would never have guessed (not that you can easily pick em or anything) he had armful of ink and something inscribed on the back of his neck, a little rough, just got his license back and a personality to boot, and i couldn't help but wonder after wiping my slate clean,how can i dirt it up again. I'm so going to hell."

"event","Why does he bother me so much, why can't i let it go, why do i let a complete asshole get to me, why do i want him so bad? These are the questions that commonly plague the association with bad boys. I can safely say that at point or another in a single girls life she has flirted with the idea of being with  a man who's not afraid to put her in her place not afraid to break her heart and pretend not to give a fuck. But here's something to think about, I've always been the kind of girl who doesn't get to close, puts my guard up a little too high, can't commit and can't handle needy, clingy people as I guess I see these as signs of weakness. These are not good qualities one should posess, trust me. 

So I always loved the chase but when I actually get what want I lose interest because the second they soften guys always seem to soften I am running for hills because I don't think I want all the drama, but it's I that creates it. I can't stick around to let myself get close or I just fuck everything up by doing something outragous like sleeping with their friend. That's exactly what happened with A1, this incrediblly strong, powerful yet somewhat gentle stature of a man warmed up in the most subtlest of ways and I just turned myself into the most stonecold bitch, and had a fling with his good friend, what kind of evil relentless person does that I hate to believe I am even capable of that but i will the first to admit and as I don't see the point in regret if I could take it all back there is absolutely no doubt I would, but I can't and I'm sorry.

 Not that i expected him to or anything but everytime i tried to muster the courage to face him and apologise he seemed as though he didn't want to hear a bar of it, like he didn't want to think about it and would rather not go back there (which is totally understandable and i would do the same thing) but i just wish that he could actually say something no matter how brutal just a moment a pure honesty I don't care I can take the pain.

It just frustrates me because I think there is only so many times one should have to apologise, afterall I'm not exactly the only one to blame he was the one the lead me onto his friend in the first place by telling me he was interested he couldv'e kept that little piece of infomation to himself and I would have had to idea and would never had developed and Interest. But we are two of the same kind and like to taunt eachother, whether he likes to think that or not (doubt the he would sleep with my friends or anything like that) and I know that he harbours that same kind of selfishness he can his heart off too and just milk it, he wants to see me on my knees while he just keeps his mouth shut and enjoys every apology; every sorry; every piece of pride I peel from my face in the vain hope that i can just get a reaction and then he changes the subject. 

So after I began to think that way I  gave up, maybe I was right or maybe I was just making worse by bringing it up all the time. For a while there things seemed to be fine and over time things started to work themselves out, how foolish was i to think that because out to nowhere he turned himself into a wall. Could this possibly be his defence mechanism is he afraid of me? But no way, that's not fucking fair, I didn't do anything wrong this time and he wouldn't accept my apologies so why if for no other reason than for revenge, then it dawns on me the horrible realisation that he just woke up one day and thought ""come on, what the hell do I see in this girl (granted I'm a few years younger and am famously known for playing games), wake up man"" that, that right there is what i'm scared of, I know I'm selfish, stupid and completely shallow for thinking i could keep someone hanging on a string and I don't want think like that at all but if there was any possible way I could get him to pay attention just for one more time, once and for all maybe I could bring out some kind of heated passion or agression within him just a piece of raw emotion a slice or reality to bring a means to an end.

He was the first man to be able to put me in my place at that is so refreshing to think that there is someone out there who can bring me down to earth and remind that I'm not the only one who can play that game. But on the other hand maybe it's just chase coming back and this time knowing that i can't actually have him that's driving me wild; that he's a little bit mean; that it's dangerous territory and that if in my wildest dreams I somehow got him back there would I fuck it all up again because i don't know any better. Or, have i learnt my lesson and know where I stand only for him to be the asshole I  know he can be and me just a target. We are so much the same in so many ways we don't like to be fucked around but somehow always seem too do the fucking and we don't like to let our guard down but everyone can see right through it even eachother it's so stupid so would it be a disaster amoung epic proportions, or if you cut all the crap and push all the bullshit aside, could two wrongs actually make a right?"

It went something along the lines of...

I was sitting in what looked like at home cinema there was hardly anyone around except for some friends a few rows in front and a very sexy guy a few seats to my right, he was very mysterious and had the most beautiful face although i can't actually remember physically what he looked like I just remember how turned on i was by him. 

He walked behind me and whispered something in my ear, nothing suggestive just making a joke or something about a friend of ours who was sitting infront, then out of nowhere we're in a kitchen at least i think it was so dark hte only light being directed from above on just us, he's strong stocky body (he wasn't gym buff, but moore like carpenter buff)was shirtless and his hands around my neck kissing me they were so big and strong that his force seemed as though could crush my face but something gentle resisted and he pushed me up against a wall and took my shirt off. 

Him wearing nothing but a pair of Blue denim jeans and me in just jeans and bra looked as though we should've been off one of those hot black and white levis commercials they've been running of late, beads of sweat were sliding down our bodies dampening the waists of our jeans and my bra seemed to be soaked, then in a whisk grab his trong hold grabbed my thighs and lifted me up around his waist. He pushed my back again this time harder against the wall, I didn't resist being picked up and felt as light as a feather almost as if i was floating on a cloud with my legs lightly crossed around his waist my hands gripping and my nails digging in between his shoulder blades. This ultra electric heat coursed through our bodies so hot as he forced his lips into the hollow between my neck and shoulders then dragging them down between my breasts he was so strong but his mouth was so soft so supple. The passion was almost unbearable so much so that i came through my jeans."

Her ex boyfriend / best friend has come all the way down from Cairns as a suprise to her (with no intentions in mind), just his way of showing how much he missed her. He (more formally known as J) has been under our new roof for little under a week and was supposed to be leaving on Sunday, it now being Friday that doesn't give him much more time but apparently is was too much for C and she couldn't wait to see him leave, so much so that when i called the house earlier he answered telling me that he had to cut his trip short and thank me for having him.

Forgive me for not knowing the details but when it comes to C there never usually is, that girl is so wound up that just being around her you actually begin to believe that you actually are walking on eggshells, while some may say it's wrong to be so quick to judge I have to known her since before our first day of school so you'd think by now i'd be able to see the signs, know where to tread lightly and where not to go at all. Actually it's quite the opposite she is just a ticking bomb that goes off when least expected, a suprise attack, a landmine.

With this useless infomation it makes it pretty easy to judge that him leaving had nothing to do with any actual matter of importance or useful infomation just the unknowningness the comes with a ticking time - bomb. She is the most obsessive person i've ever known so it makes so hard to believe that someone with so much potential so much passion, that someone so beautiful can explode over something so irrelevant to anything, so petty that never actually know what your fighting for let alone what you've done wrong. While I'll never understand the mystery that be C I have given up trying, even though no good can come of that, it would be a disaster amoung epic proportions is I was ever to tell her to sometimes just 'shut the fuck up'. I'm used to it and I don't see it as something to throw a friendship away over so i'll just keeping treading lightly and take each hit on the sleeve and pray that someday she'll wake up with confidence or whatever it is she needs to stop treating people that way."

I guess it's my fault really. But after all we've been through what kind of person would he even try that? He makes me so mad sometimes, so angry that i'm not even angry at him at all, angry because I harbour so much resentment at my own careless, stupid self.

I really can't make any sense out of anything at the moment, shouldn't it be easier if ii've felt like this befor? Truth is and this may sound dumb but i really can't remember much of how i felt back then whether something inside of me chose to block out the memories, the drugs they feed me wiped the feelings, maybe i just put it all behind me? But,  whatever the case, it wasn't good. Isn't funny how sometimes we just wish away the days because we long for a better one and looking back it seems like such a long time ago. Three years in fact, three years isn't a long time at all and should certainly be able to remember it so where did i store all my memories, where did they go? Or are they slowly just coming back to haunt me now and I mistake them for regret?

 If only I could find them I may be able to deal with this a little better.

god listen to myself, deal with what? But lastnight, for the first time i told him that he couldn't stay that i was meeting someone (with whom 's identity didn't but as he still thinks our friends are mutual and all of the same circle a ""stranger"" would be of some threat) I didn't want to lie it's  funny though how the most simplest of words can have such a strong impact on someone. 

I am so proud of myself, proud of waking up in my own bed on a saturday morning alone. No one needed to snuggle or kiss, just; my pillow, the Cranberries and a breathtaking view seen from the confort of my own bed, what else could i possibly need! I really hope lastnight did him some justice, a voice inside told him somethimg wasn't right and that there is nothing left for me to give. 

So I think i've completely established that fact ( and concreted it for good use) that i am just a little confused right now so i'm going to deal with it the only way i know how, instead of sitting in bed writing about as form of therapy, i'[m going to shutdown, log off, hold my head up and smile and be on my merry way to the hairdressers shaking it all off me with a shrug because c'mon, ""I've through a worse than this""?"

"event","Lately I've noticed my change in attitude towards how i view this city. In the light of day instead of putting my head up and strutting through it like I used to, I've began to to notice a gradual change in the way I walk. I started to notice the flaws in the people around me, glances aren't when someone catches your eye and notices you because they thought you stood out in the crowd, no, actually they are! 

These days people aren't viewed in the same light like they used to be. So why am i trying so hard to keep it light, only to keep winding up in the dark.

The cracks in the concrete begin to deeper and deeper and suddenly seem like your only way out, no longer was i walking with my head held high but rather sinking into the sidewalk. My feet no longer strut and my pride is obsolete when i realised exactley what i was through the eyes of onlookers, entertainment, who I am is not considered, but rather what i am. My voice' is silent and non - existant in this city. I'm too young to deeply know myself yet so dumbfounded to think that complete strangers think they that with one glance they can see right through me, that these people know who i am, men think they can get inside me with every drink they buy me, 'I'm too young to know respect so why do I deserve theirs?'

And although I re-assure myself daily that 'they don't think like this', in the cruel harsh reality of day and the colder, darker reality of night, it's true. It's no longer safe to walk these streets alone at night, we have to walk alongside a man, or so they say, just to be safe. But with all my innocence and virginity stolen, how can this be true? How can we ever be safe in this city, a city where these animals are free to roam the streets, and what i want to know is who will rescue me, next time I'm attacked? 

So next time when you see my eyes not focusing right don't be so quick to judge, just know that it's not that I'm trying to escape the horrific reality of it all, or run far from the truth, it's that I know that no-ones deserves  to have to relive it everyday."

"event","It's been a few weeks and i'll fill in the details but i am so euphoric this  evening, this may sound totally fucked up but i just broke it off with my on off ex for four years and i couldn't be happier. You've probably established the fact the i'm not really the take home type, but, to my own disbelief i made it to the four year mark, and with an entire life ahead of me it seemed as though breaking up was the sainest thing i've done in years. 

I'll fill in the rollercoaster details later (so i can make it a little more understandable) but right now I just need to let it all out there into the cosmos. 

Fill in later, my glass is empty, but until then....



P.S  You may be a little confused to the fact that i'm listening to Glycerine while being excited about a breakup, but I am, for no other reason than it's been ringing in my head all day while contemplating life without him and the scrutinizing indecisiveness if i was making the right decision or not but, now, i just feel... refreshed."

"event","You know how there's that one special person in your life at one time or another with whom you become absolutely so spell bound by. You obsess over every little thing it's dangerous, every article ever written, every little outfit ever worn. The obsession takes over and suddenly they become your first thought in the  morning right unitl your last thought at night.

I may sound completely shallow and cynical when i say this ( and it's sad but true) but i never thought these people actually exist in real life(meaning, you watch them on t.v but the chances of bumping into them at the coffee shop; realise they feel the same tell you they love you and you run off, get married and live happilly ever after, the chances of that happening are very very slim almost  none existant), but this man does exist and he is  real and he is fabulous.



I've always been one of those people who just put myself out there and blow off the consequence with a shrug leading me to get over the nerves and make the first move, I didn't quite get the answer i was looking for but in all honesty it wasn't that bad because i  was proud of myself for having the balls to do it you only live once so what have i got to lose. 

But what gets to me is i can't decide what's worse os it the fact that he's a complete rarity and i don't think i'd ever be in the presence of anyone like that he does exist and i've used up my one and only chance. WillI ever get another one, who knows but i know yself well enough to know that people like him don't come around very often and you sit around, do nothing and wait for him to throw himself at you or you can put yourself out there see things clearly  and get on your life and just be proud of yourself because you had the guts to make things  happen. It is nice to know that they are  out there and who knows you may just be  pleasantly suprised."

"event","I don't think it's just me but why is it that whenever you invite someone to your home whether it be the Pizza man or the Electrician foresay they're either incredibly old and / or un - attractive so i can't help but wonder what it is about these men that is such a turn on.

All my life I have secretly lived for the day when a sexy repair man would walk through my door and throw me onto the kitchen bench, but it just doesn't happen anymore, in my experiance the only plumbers that have fixed my sink didn't quite fit the part to play out any fantasy of mine. So in saying that you could imagine my delight when I answered the door to an incredibly sexy young man by the name of Chris, he looked as though he was fresh out an apprenticeship, he was prepared and very ready to service my pipes.

Anyway back to the story, he was really quite sweet when he introduced himself, he walked in we started talking (You know basic chit chat, nothing exciting, couldn't stop staring at that tool belt) I was trying so hard to concentrate on what it was he was saying but I just couldn't understand a word of it (well truth be told i wasn't really listening), i just couldn't stop thinking about how good the kitchen bench was looking right about now. 

So he started plodding around playing with the taps, as they do. The thought of him in my shower was just making me too wet. It was just getting so hot I had to get out of there, so I told him my secret hiding spot for the front door key, thanked him for his services and heading off to work.

... Eight hours later and absolutely no worked done at all, my mind still fixated on Chris the Plumber and his very suggesting tool belt, I battle my way up the hill, reach into the sercret hiding hole pull out the key and open the door.

I walked in threw my keys on the table and picked up his card with a note on the back that read,

""If there is anything else you need, anything at all you can call me 24-7, I'm your Handy-Man"".

I couldn't refrain my laughter it was undeniable, now that i've got the re-assurance I needed, I just can't let this oppurtunity go. I need a plan of action, because that kitchen bench is still looking pretty good."

"event","This is going to be short and i'll try to keep it light but man oh my there are some very emotionally unstable people on this site. In the short half hour i've been logged on I have read some pretty fucked up shit and some you really do sound like you need professional help rather than seek advice from complete strangers, most of which probably have no real idea of what you're actually going through anyway, is it just me or is there something really wrong there? 

This isn't an attack on anyone at all but for some of you, come on! And then there are the others who don't actually seem to have any problem at all and are just looking for someone to feel sorry for them, but if you're seeking attention wouldn't you rather seek it from someone who actually knows your name, or better yet, cares? Lighten up, the world may not be all great and good but cheer up cause it may never happen!!!"

"event","So i'm sitting here at desk hiding behind my computer and directly across from me is the most awful man i have ever met (FYI, this awful man goes by the name of Mr P (the P is for Power Trip) he is demanding, controlling, ruthless, lazy, heartless and blames everyone else instead of acknowledging his own mistakes). He walks around with his nose in the air and is always on a rampage. Considering i'm the youngest and only female in the office I guess I make for an easy target, it seems as though i'm getting to point where i just want to pack it all in and leave (and the idea of directing the staple gun to his knees befor I do seems all the more inviting) but no, I refrain myself. There is absoluteley no way that i'm going to let some balding middle aged asshole with a power trip gain authority over me, absolutely not.

 Anyway i've come up with a new solution to this problem, before walking out the door (and leading him to believe I can't take the heat) I get equal power and satisfaction by imagining the his ""O"" face (you know that uncontrollable force that runs through your face right before you're about to come) I know it's a horrifying thought but trust me when I say I feel i've got the power now. 

While he may still hold a sense off power in the office I know there is absolutley no way he could hold the power in the bedroom, I mean with a that kind of attitude, no thanks.

P.S. If you don't believe me about the ""O"" face thing I suggest trying out for yourself, little John Howard always make for a good laugh."

"event","Well this Live Journal is certainly something ins't it, I've usually been under the impression that internet chat sites are completely ridiculous and that people who spend every waking hour on them deserve to die (virtual friendships for those with no grip on reality), saying that i realise that i probably just made so many unwanted enemies so this is your chance to prove me wrong. 

I figure that as i am completely anonymous i can share i my escapades with the world and no one will get hurt, well we see how long it lasts anyway and if anyone catches on. Don't me wrong i'm not trying to flatter myself or think that I know all there is to know but i can say i've had my fair share or dating disasters but when i look back at some of my past experiances with men i swear sometimes all you can do is laugh so i'm hoping that somehow i can maybe bring a little laugh into your day as well and just know that girls, and guys when it comes to the wild world of single (and married life) all those little secrets you thought you'd never in all your life be able to spill to anyone, well now's your chance."

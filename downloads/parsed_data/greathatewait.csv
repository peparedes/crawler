"event","well this past week has been a blur honestly. Tonight against Palm Bay we lost :( , we wrestled well, coach just made a booboo. it happens, we got melbourne this upcoming wednesday, and for lack of a better phrase i just want to fuck someone up, like full on just go ape shit, its the last jv match of the season, i cant get suspended, its time to go crazy, plus no one on their fucking team can beat me. we get this weekend off, i have plans ALL weekend, plus the SAT on saturday. good news though, i have jack shit going on in school tomorrow.WOOT WOOT. So it will be a good restful weekend then kickin ass next week.

Oh you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waiting and I wait at the longest night
Nothing like the taste to sweet decline

I was down, I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing last
Dancing with the thorns of my buried past

Nevermind there's nothing I can do
Bet your life there's something killing you

It's a shame we have to die my dear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

What a way to go, they have no fear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time

Finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Heart across a heart that beats it's best

Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Then the pleasure 'bout the pleasure's
been mine, all mine

Ain't no way, DOA
Ain't no way, DOA

It's a shame we have to disappear
No ones getting out of here, alive
This time
This time
This time"

You cannot kill what you did not create 
I've gotta say what I've gotta say 
And then I swear I'll go away 
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise 
I guess I'll save the best for last

"event","well after i woke up today i just hung around all day,it was kind of my chill out day, sometime when you see people too much you can get ground down, so it was nice to have some on-my-own-time. i didnt really tlak to anyone at all i just the away message up and just lazed around. The whole church deal, i have decided that i dont need a church to help me become a better person, i believe in God, but Churches are just to overbearing and right now the last thing i want is an entity telling me how to live my life or how evil or w/e i am. i want to keep my mind open, churches dont allow that. i dont think i will be attending Advent Lutheran anymore. for new years i will have family here, Christian might come over, but AJ cant make it...so idk i may invite someone else. but one question who will i kiss on new years? hahah JK! im really hoping that my parents will let me go back to wrestling, training wise right now im fat cutting, i put on muscle now im just trimming the fat off, what little of it i have. so yeah. after wrestling is over im going to do okinawan kenpo, i think that will help me with my mixed martial arts because my stand-up game sucks terribly. for those of you that dont have a clue what im talking about, when i compete/fight in mixed martial art im not good at standing and punching kicking etc. im good at taking them down and submitting them (choking, armbars etc) i mean i haveskills but i wouldnt stand with anyone. i havent fought in like 3 years, goin to a dojo will help immensly. well im outta here. YES I KNOW NO LYRICS!!!!!!!!"

I'm getting edgy all the time
There's someone around me just a step behind
It's kinda scary the , the shape I'm in
The walls are shakin'and they' re closing in
Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
There' s one guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder is a big mistake
Sitting on the bed
Or lying wide awake
There's demons in my head
And it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll
But I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is
I gotta get away from me
I tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my fiends cause they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped
If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
I think I'm being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creepin' on the ground

Something takes a part of me.
Something lost and never seen.
Everytime I start to believe,
Something's raped and taken from me... from me. 
Life's got to always be messing with me. (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain. (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain... in vain. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release. (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free... is free
Chorus 

Boom na da mmm dum na ema 
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema 

GO! 
So...fight! something on the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight
So...something on the... dum na ema
Fight...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
No...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight 

[Chorus]

Part of me...
Oh..."

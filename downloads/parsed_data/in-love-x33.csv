"event","k, so for about 4 years now, people have asked me what i saw in Jeremy, and why i stayed with him for so long... im not sure WHAT i saw in him, he was just, like a puppy with no home... and he was so unwanted... even by me, but i fealt bad. We hated eachother, it was a mutual thing... we NEVER got along... ever... always argued... the sex sucked... i was just a miserable person... but he had a car... which kept me around so much longer... i could GO places... he was my bitch... i said take me here, he said ok honey... and we went... than i got pregnant, which was planned, he told me it would make our relationship better, mmmmkay, didnt happen but what ever... It made sense in a 17 year olds mind... I got pregnant ((as if no one knows)) and my mother was excited... she was happy, called my whole family and told people... I was excited to, i had a BABY in my stomach... i was GROWING a human... than as time went on he started to hit me, and rape me, and verbally abuse me, and i stayed with him, cause he had a fuggin car... a lil materialistic?? yupp... i was 17 damnit... we broke up... i moved in with Liz and her mommy and Kate... it was a good time i guess, but back to Jeremy and stuff... we were broken up, I dated around, still saw him, just not in a &quot;relationship&quot; with him... I dated around a lil bit, not MUCH... *counts people* 4 people i think... for a few months... the same 4 people... but i ended back up with him cause we had a baby together and i just had an attachment... than i moved outta lizs and moved to Westfield with my father, i dated a lil while i was still with Jeremy... ((oops, sorry bout that)) and still stayed with him... he got me outta my fathers house once a day for a few hours, til my father offered him beer, than i turned invisible... it was like magic... POOF... stephs gone... and than we moved back to Chicopee with my mom... Jeremy was living with my mom while all of this was happening, but w/e... I got a job at McDonalds, cause the lil boy who got me pregnant couldnt do what he thought he could... he could NOT take care of me and a child... not even close to it... i used to go into work crying with bruises all over my face, and arms... all over my body... I was abused... Michael saw this and watched me hurt all the time. I talked to him, he became my bestfriend... I fell inlove with our friendship, i loved being with him more than anything in the world... I had only seen him AT work... i called him on the phone and vice versa... but never hung out outside of work... He kept telling me to leave Jeremy, that other people liked me, and would treat me much better... I finally took his advice, took my ring off from Jeremy, told him i wasnt engaged to him anymore, i couldnt deal with the abuse... than one weekend i was going to saras for a party and invited him... knowing he doesnt drink, he never has and never will... I got a lil drunkish and molested Michael... *heh* he wouldnt have sex with me, said he had to much respect than to take advantage of me... what ever... i went back to saras a week or 2 later and he came again... this time i practically raped him, than we went back to his house at like... 2am... and yeah... we had sex... all the while Jeremy was still living with me... we were broken up but my mom wouldnt kick him out... he had no where to go... ((his parents didnt like me, and they told him if he stayed with me he had to leave *when Christopher was born*, so he did...)) so I got kicked out of my moms house cause i was dating Michael... my mother would NOT see to that being done in her home... I moved in with Michaels parents... and than back to my moms with her and Jeremy... Michaels parents were straight up psychos... oh my gosh... Jeremy and I got an apartment... still not in a relationship... but we needed eachother... DSS came in one day to the apartment... and met with me, they spoke to me, i told them what happened... they told me to leave, now... so i did... Michael had moved outta his parents house a few days after me... he moved in with his friends mom... well I moved in there too... her landlord FLIPPED... so we went back to his parents house... i went back to school in hopes of getting my GED and he was still at walmart... i messed up... i met a guy online... and almost fucked it all up... Michael almost flew to MI to kill the guy... but he didnt.. i stopped talking to him all together... ((the guy, not Michael)) I got a&nbsp; job at wal-mart in march... and than in april we got our own place... no one to tell us what we can eat, or buy... no one to make more of a mess than us... its all US here... me Michael and Christophers home... no one elses... oh... and the cats... but they dont complain much... I have been doing so good with no Jeremy... and i didnt think i would EVER do good with out him... it was such a scary thought being with OUT Jeremy... but its good, Michael took me away and changed my life i guess... 

mmkay, yes i realize there is NO point to this blog... but... i had to write it... cause its snowing and im excited... heh...&nbsp;"

"event","&quot;I am not the president of The blue states. I Am not the presidant of the red States.. I am the president of the UNITED states of america. And together, we can change the world we live in.. YES WE CAN!&quot;

WHAT change is he tryin to bring to us?? hes trying to pull us outta the fucking hole BUSH got us into... hes trying to get our troops home, cause so many of us miss them... hes trying to save us...

fuck everyone who has said &quot;im leaving the country because obama&quot;

and if you said &quot;no he shouldnt win&quot; because:

1- &quot;hes muslim&quot; learn your facts, christianity is not much different then islam and our country is based on the idea of freedom of religion even if he is muslim who cares?.. but no its ok to be just disregared everything our country is based on

2- &quot;hes black&quot; just straight up shoot yourself. saying he cant be president because hes black is the worst excuse ever..

3- &quot;hes socialist&quot; if he was a socialist, his ideas wouldnt be democratic you dumb chode nuggets. most of you probably dont even know what socialism is or how it works.


4- &quot;hes a terrorist&quot; along with #1. not all muslims are terrorists. only the stupid extremists which are doing the exact same thing as the extreme catholics and protestants in ireland.
and who said he was a muslim in the first place?

5- &quot;he wants to end the war&quot; and if you like this war to continue im going to assume you also like seeing tons of people die cause bush is tryna impress his daddy...

AND: He's not a liar.
He sees the middle road
On just about every importanat issue
That has been presented to him,
Which means he is the most apt
To do well in office.

Abortion, even though it is wrong,
Is a choice that should be made
By the mother and the father..
Not the President.

Think of how bad our Economy is thus far;
Now would you really want McCain to run
This country?
McCain fully supported Bush..
And look at how Bush turned out.

so in my closing conclusion: the country cant get much worse.. and its not even HIM who runs the country... its the CONGRESS... he just gets to live in a big pretty house... so shut up people..."

There will be a restraining order placed for your<br />safety, because this isn't worth me going to jail... I'd hate to hurt<br />Christopher that way taking away both his dads, but if it comes to using a<br />restraining to cut the communication, which  absoluty has nothing to do with<br />Christopher then  so be it, your mother and Heather take better care of<br />Christopher anyways, your to busy paying some chick's bills, you have a<br />decent paying job and your always broke.... with what bills? Going out to kfc...<br />could be better used on Christopher, oh wait I take care of him anways so your<br />not needed...<br /><br />I'm pretty sure even Steph would agree with on this, you could shove the<br />child support and just let her full custody... Your Worthless..... She's not<br />giving you a chance your not worth her time of day...<br /><br />We are getting married and we are going to have children together.. We have<br />neames picked out already if its a girl its going to be Madison or Rosemary if<br />its a boy Tyler or Michael..<br /><br />She's going to get her ged she's going to get her license she's<br />doesn't need this bullshit drama, we don't need this drama. She's<br />going to have a career, life and she's going to be FUCKING happy without you<br />in it... Get over it... MOVE THE FUCK ON!!!!<br /><br />Your a liar and a loser, you've been caught its over, stop the drama your<br />hurting your son, if you cared and truly loved Steph and Christopher you would<br />move on, but Jeremy maybe you should see a psychiatrist and get your head<br />checked, because changing means changing....<br /><br />Doing the same shit that you've done for the past 3 or 4 years or whatever<br />to get to Steph isn't changing....<br /><br />Being a baby that losts it bottle and crying for a chance.... How much of a man<br />are you, the word sorry I've bet you've used that a thousand times to<br />her, what meaning does it have now... The word love... do you even know the<br />definition...<br /><br />It sure as hell isn't hitting, abusing, forcing them to have sex when they<br />don't want it.. It's not risking your unborn son's life by pushing..<br /><br />Its not neglecting her emotions, her needs, love is about sacrifice, something<br />that isn't learned or taught its something you do..<br /><br />Its something thats intiatilly there its not oh WOW.. im going to change after<br />doing all this shit to someone... Jeremy that just doesn't work.. You<br />don't understand love, you just understand a wet penis..<br /><br />Steph's better then you, and if you continue on with your freaking<br />harassment you will end up in jail, I won't deal with this crap no one needs<br />it.. She's stressed from school and everything else and doesn't need<br />your dumbass causing more..<br /><br />Your the defective dna that Christopher unfortunately recieved, wish he could<br />of done of better with his father, but hey what can be changed... At least he is<br />turning out good, can't say the same for you.. Looks like the best part of<br />you ran down your mother's leg?.....<br /><br />If this doesn't stop our communication to Steph will be cut... If i even<br />hear the word if you trying to hook up with her or get her back, im not going to<br />hold strings I've held my temper for far to long and been way to nice<br />something that is characteristic of me...<br />You are Christopher's father only reason I put up with this bullshit... Buy<br />a fucking blow up doll if your that horny.. get over her she isn't going<br />back to you its over.. We'll invite to the wedding if you want??<br /><br /><br /><br /></pre>"

"event","im having a BAD fuckin day... i swear...

i didnt&nbsp; wake up till at almost 1 this afternoon... which was fine, i was up till about 4 this morning... i woke up to michael clicking something in WoW n i looked around the room n said are ya gonna START the laundry,&nbsp; about 2 seconds after that i fell back to sleep.. i NEED my sleep... he had been up since 10 this morning n came on to play a fuckin game, ignored the laundry and started a game up, a min. after i said that he did the laundry and than proceeded to go on n play more... i woke up at fuckin 3 this after noon n he was still playing... i went got my self something to eat n stuff n than went n sat in the living room till about 5 when i called kryto n asked her for a ride to my mas to check the mail n see if Dennys sent me anything ((n they did)) but thats not the point... i than came home n upstairs... n he was STILL playing the fuckin game... like... HOLY MOLY... ur ENGAGED... n he sat there playing the fuckin game till about 7, untill i asked if he was almost done he said yes n got off so i could go on... about 20 mins later he was on the couch sleepin... i love him i truely do but its like damn... if ur THAT tired than maybe u shoulda slept in!! not woken up after about 5 hours of sleep n went to play a fuckin game... 

n i sat there today on the chair n cried for about 10 mins b4 he even realized something was wrong... b/c he was PLAYING THE GAME... n than i got up to go get the laundry n sniffled a little bit n he followed me... n asked me what was wrong... like... i dono... it was weird...

i had a flashback... of all the reasons me n Jeremy rnt together... like the abuse n shit... n the things he did to intentionally hurt me... not by accident... but to be mean... like changed the locks when DSS took me n the baby outta the apartment...&nbsp; n the baby had NO shampoo only clothes... nothing for his ears or ANYTHING... n ME? i had a lil bitta clothes n a few stupid random thinggs but nothing... i NEEDED... i had no razors n no shampoo NOTHING... n i was stayin at my moms... n GRRR we had NOTHING... n he didnt CARE... i called him SOBBING n askin him to let me get some of the babys stuff atleast, he said no... how he used to shove me across the room when i didnt listen to him... like when i told him we were over n i wanted to be with michael and he pushed me across the room n i hit my head on a door frame... n he wouldnt let me call michael or leave... i was SO scared... n my ma had her therapist call dss b/c i was scared n she BEGGED me to let her tell her therapist n i said ok... n she did than i got saved... after like 2 days of living with my ma i moved in here... n im still kinda scared at times that Jeremys gonna hurt me... b/c im engaged n he misses me... n i miss him... more than anything in this fuckin WORLD... but kryto talked to me today about it b/c its SO hard to talk to michael about it... n she told me *u miss the OLD him, when he was cool to be with, not the asshole he turned into* n its true... i didnt like what he started to do to me... well he had been abusive since like... when we first met n i kept threatening to leave him... n that i finally did october 2nd... i up n left him... like... really left... although we had been broken up for a while, i just got raped when he wanted sex... b/c i cried n said no, but he did it anyways... n i didnt tell michael b/c i knew he would kill him, michael is very territorial ((sp??)) n i was HIS girlfriend ((now fiance)) n if he only knew the abuse i was goin thru to be with him... man... it still makes me shiver when i think about it... n at times i cry... b/c i did love Jeremy... just wasnt INlove with him...&nbsp; i dont think... or maybe i was... n i am just in a different degree of love with michael...

i dono... anyways... that was all i had to write about i guess... uhm? comments??"

"event","i just needed to come on and write a quickie about michael...

he makes me feel so happy... like... i miss him so much while hes at work... i just wanna walk to walmart n hug him... bleh... but its cold AND the babys sleeping b/c its late... but i will hug him in the morning...

he supports me on all my decisions and if he disagrees he tells me... but if i feel strongly about it he just keeps quiet...

he makes me feel so pretty... he always tells me how pretty i am... and kisses me with such gentle kisses, and hugs me with so much LOVE...

he can make me smile no matter what, i can be mad at him and he still makes me smile... hes just amazing...

i love when hes home with me... on weekends... we cuddle all weekend except saturday night b/c thats when we go out... 

for our 1 year he got me a 1 karat diamond necklace, its a heart and its fuckin GORGEOUS... i got it early b/c he didnt wanna hide it... lol... but its ok... im in love with it... and hes gettin me a camcorder for christmas... wooot!! but even with our any of that id still love him... he just tries to make me happy... and no one else ever has... well not like he does... ive always had exs who indulged in themselves...

hes totally changed from when i first met him though... hes no longer quiet and distant... now hes just... perfect... i really think i found my one true love... he makes all the bad stuff in my life turn around and he makes me happy...

Michael Corliss... i love u... &lt;33"

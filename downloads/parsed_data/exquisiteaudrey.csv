"event","My morning has gone splendidly so far. I had my usual oatmeal and tea for breakfast, then the professor came in to teach me my normal lessons for learning proper English. How boring...I wish I could see my father again, I do miss him so. But you know, if I want to be one of London's elite, then I must give up a few things. Oh well, I guess it will take a little time to get used to living like this. Even though it is amazing to have anything I want at the ring of a bell, I still miss my friends. But the last time I visited them, they never recognized me, which hurt me deeply. Soon i'll go back and they will know me. I just know it.

"event","Oh my, I do love Tiffany and Co, even to this day! I just recently bought the most beautiful heart necklace and matching ring there, and i was dreadfully happy with them! They are just simply lovely. My darlings, I must be off to the library to study up on South America! I can't let myself go to waste you know, with all those rich men out there! Well, hope to write again soon. And if anyone sees Fred, please tell him hello for me. I haven't seen him in ages.

"event","Hello good Friends! I have just finished my afternoon tea and will be chatting for a while until time calls me unto another place. I hope all is going well for everyone. I am going to be taking a much needed break all this week from work so I will have more time to update everyone on the progresses of my life. Well, good night to all!

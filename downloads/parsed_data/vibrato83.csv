"event","I decided not to major in flute performance.  I'm just not that into flute anymore.  I guess I ""burned out"" already.  My parents don't know yet, and I'm still trying to think of how I'm going to break it to them.  But it's too late to change my mind, because I already sold my flute to a pawn shop for beer money.

I've decided instead that I'm going to double major in linguistics and mechanical engineering."

Just kidding!

I have a bad cough, and my throat is really sore.  I borrowed some ibuprofen from Gracie this afternoon, so it must be because my throat is sore.  I mean, of course I would know if my own throat was sore, it's not like this isn't me, Catherine, typing this.  Because it is me, Catherine, typing this.  I update my own livejournal.  It's not like I would let someone else do it for me or anything.

She decided to take it upon herself to chronicle the life of her apathetic (rith respect to LJ) roommate... This is perfectly okay with me, but I just had to set things straight so that I would not decieve all my ""loyal fans.""  

My roommies have convinced me to ingest large amounts of caffeine and stay up all night long.  Not sure how that's going to go... But it's Willy Week -- I ought to be a little crazy ;)

It's Friday tomorrow!!  

And FYI, Leslie's flute recital is Saturday @ 4 after most of the Beer Bike stuff will be done!  It's going to be great.  So scoot on over to Duncan (or take the 'shittle') and hear it!

There are some Wiessmen outside on the second floor enoying the cool (yes, cool!) wind and rain...  Looks like fun if only I weren't in my pajamas and busy working on theory. 
Speaking of, it's time for me to get back to work.
The girls are leaving tomorrow...  It'll be a bit lonely around here!  But Jessica will be around, so tomorrow we're biking to Whole Foods to do some shopping for food over the weekend (the serveries will be closed.)  And there'll be lots of time to practice, read, study, work on these final papers and projects!  Only 10 more days till my return to good ol' K-town!

"event","Here begins my second post of the day...  Just waiting a few minutes more before going to work on my papers and things!  It's beautiful outside; the windows are open, it's dark, and lighting flashes every few minutes.  We have a great view from our room.  

In my last post I didn't mention what an awesome weekend I had.  Except for being scared out of my mind after watching ""The Exorcist"" for the first time (If you haven't seen it, don't.  Ever.)  Granted, it was better than some of the mindless, violent horror movies out there, but it was terrifying.  After that movie ended (I was so relieved when the credits came on at the end...) we played some cheery music and Gracie taught Sarah and I to play Egyptian Rat Screw.  That game is so much fun!!  Then on Saturday Sarah and I went downtown to the science museum, where we went into an incredible butterfly exhibit, saw lots of other interesting things, and did a little shopping in the museum store (where from Beorn came...see previous post!)  

After Sarah and I finished looking around the museum, we decided it was time for some dinner.  Bad idea, especially when it's late and dark and we're wandering in the 4th largest city in the US.  Nothing happened really, other than we were a bit nervous, and after checking out a few restaurants, saw that getting drunk in a bar late at night while lots of loud and anxious music is playing isn't really our cup of tea.  But we made it back on the Metro just fine, and just as soon as we reached those familiar Rice hedges, my scooter died.  (Too much wandering in the museum wore poor Scootie out.)  Fortunately, I had my charger with me, and plugged it in at the Rice police station.  Then Sarah and I got an secort back to our room, put our bags down, and ventured (me on my bike this time) to the Village, where we had a great dinner in a cute french cafe.  We stopped at Walgreens and picked up some things, then Sarah rode my freshly charged scooter back to the Swamp while I biked.  It was funny to watch her ride it :)

And that night, Sarah, Gracie and I began we're sure will be one of the great Swamp traditions: Celtic Card Night!  We played cards, drank hot chocolate, turned on some awesome Scottish music, and laughed really hard.  

By that time, the wee hours of Sunday morning had arrived, nevertheless we turned on Lord of the Dance.... Wait.  Uhh... No we didn't.  Of course we didn't.  Who would watch such a ridiculous thing, eh guys?!  ;) 

Then on Sunday Gracie and I took a trip to the library and explored.  Fondren is amazing!!  And then after some fluting, reading, fooding, and homeworking, I fell asleep until this morning.  It was a great weekend. 

Well, I suppose it's time to get down to work! (Hope work isn't too dreadful tonight, Gracie!!) 

Happy Monday, everyone."

"event","Hello out there!

So I've finally started one of these things.  I hope I don't waste too much time...

Right now I'm sitting here trying not to laugh too hard at Gracie; she's at her computer with headphones on pronouncing a bunch of old English words along with a recording.  Sounds like fun.  

We just had a good laugh over the fact that she had to take her wrinkled work clothes out of the dirty laundry - I guess she hasn't washed them in 4 weeks or so, and she has to wear them at work tonight.  Ummm....

Only 11 more days till my flight home!  I really can't wait; it'll be the first time I'll have seen my house and my family since mid August.  In the meantime, though, I'm (honestly!) having some fun working on some projects and papers and getting lots of good practicing done.  It feels great to have time in the afternoons to sit in the room and read and do homework.  The last few weeks were crazy busy.  Lots of fun, but a bit exhausting.  

My roommate and I have a new pet: a Grow Dino from the science museum named Beorn (aka ""Warrior"" in Old English.)  He's grown just over an inch since we put in in water at 12:46 this morning.  Looks a little gooey and bloated, but we've concluded that it just must be Beorn going through the ugly phase everyone has during adolescence.  ;) 

Time to get back to homework before orchestra tonight - I rearranged my desk last night, and now I have room to put my books somewhere other than on top of the keyboard while I'm reading them.  Very nice."

"event","Raymond and I are taking a long break, if not forever. I'm pretty sure that it's over, though I'm not sure how it got to this point. I guess it doesn't even matter, because now we need to fix our relationship. Trust me, other than the amazing break up sex, I don't see any effort on his part to fix anything. Big surprise! 

To live with my mother, what nice things I can I say? Seriously, I'm trying to think of one. I drew a blank. I guess it's nicer here than the rather appealing cardboard box under the interstate. That box IS rather appealing.

I've got a funny story about my mom. She once went into the kitchen and opened the fridge, freezer and a cabinet. Then she walked into the living room and sat down. She called to me, while I was in the dining room working on homework. ""Rachael, please get me a glass of tea."" How lazy can one person be? I think this story answers that question. 

My mother and I never had gotten along well. I used to try to be close with her, but over time that proved to be a complete WASTE of time. I think it all started with another story (by the way, if you're reading this and you don't care, I'd suggest that you just stop reading. More stories will come.).

I had a crush on Jeff M. and I tried to keep it a secret from everyone. I was in 8th grade and I'd liked other guys before, but Jeff was the first I liked that liked me back. Most other guys did't even notice me. I guess you need to know I used to be a fat kid and only thined up in 7th grade. My new found beauty, well, I guess I didn't know about it until much later. 

My mom and her boyfriend, Vincent, listened to one of my phone calls with Jeff. They could tell I liked him, so they invited him over to eat steak. EXCEPT THEY WERE EATING STEAK.. NOT US!!! They went out of their way to embarrass me and they did. Jeff didn't seem to mind because he was there with me, but I never admitted that I liked him back then. Why? I was too embarrassed! They picked on me for liking him, because they thought that he was ugly, but I've ever seen it. To this day, I still think he's one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen. I once showed a picture of Jeff and me to a friend. She picked on me for liking him too. I guess sometimes the love you have for someone will make them beautiful. Because I've see Jeff recently and he was more handsome than ever. 

I remember having my first daughter, Evelyn. Raymond and my mother were with me the entire time. Except my mother was sleeping most of the time in the window bed there for fathers. So Raymond was awake while I slept. He was so concered and ever left my side. I was in labor for 20 hours, so for him not to leave to go eat or anything meant something to me. But the point is, he shouldn't had a place to lay down and rest... and my mother was sleeping there the whole time. How selfish can one person be? She made my having a baby all about her. I don't know how.. but she did. 

My mom makes life more difficult than it has to be. Why can't we all just be laid back and support each other? Because that would be the decent thing to do. I'll stop complaining, at least she's giving me a place to stay, even if I don't like it. It's just going to be hard."

"event","Years ago, I needed a break from my relationship. Grades were dropping, and everything was going to shit. It's never been hard to break up with someone I was with; I was an expert. But it was different this time. I wasn't breaking up, I just needed time to get everything right again. 

I told him, and he went crazy thinking it was over. And it was. But because he thought it was... 

Now we are friends again, and I admitted it. He only said ""seriously?"" <i>No, I lied!</i> I should have let him believe I ended it. Do I have to make things difficult? I suppose the answer is yes.  

He's married now, with a son on the way. I have two kids. But part of me wishes I had a second chance to make it right. The rest of me knows it was for the best. He's better because of it, and I know it. I just want to turn off the part of my brain that says ""what if?"" Better yet, remove it forever. NO REGRETS! That's what I keep telling myself. 

It's still new to be talking to him again, but somehow we fell right back into stide. I will learn to cope with the fact he's married and I've been replaced. I will. It just takes time. 

At least I can take comfort in this: I was his first true love. You'll only have one first. I'm glad it was me. 

Well, because other people might actually read this, I'd like to say ""Sorry!"" you read this. It was probably a huge waste of time! You'll never get it back. Wouldn't it be great if people that wasted your time had to give you a refund? ""I'll replace your wasted time, with more time..."" It just doesn't work that way... Sorry!"

"event","I've been debating on making a list at the beginning of each year, to see how much I change over time. I guess it's a pretty stupid idea, because I tend to see myself in this light of perfection, when I'm really pretty flawed. But since I decided to do it, might well get it over with. 

I am truly compassionate about other people. When you're sick or in pain, come see me and I'll take care of you. The problem with this is that I tend to go overboard with it. Other people don't want to be pampered as much I pamper them. I have gotten a little bit better about backing off though. The phase, ""I'm hurt, not helpless."" is something I hear often. 

If I didn't want to be a bad ass web designer, I'd be a nurse or a doctor. I know I ruled out being a doctor long ago, so long ago I was actually with my ex. I just hate seeing dead things, and I certainly don't want to cut anything dead open. Which is odd, because I don't mind stitching people up as best I can and sending them on their way. I recently tried to fix a chainsaw victim, which was fortunately just a flesh wound, but he needed more help than I could give him. I sent him to the ER. Which leads me to my next point.

I know when to give up. I know giving up is considered a bad thing, but sometimes it's not. I'd love to think I knew everything in the world, but I don't. I'm not the right person to sew you arm back on, and if I have to cut off some of your mangled skin and meat... well, it's just not going to happen. I know I can't do it. I also know I don't know everything about all types of web design. When I do though, everyone will know! 

I guess to a point, I'm conceited. Not that I am better than everyone else, because I'm not. BUT, I try to do my best in everything. I take pride in my work, and I want everyone to like it.  

I love knowing more on subjects than other people. If someone knows something I don't, I will do research on the subject so I can know more about it. Education is important to me.

I have been called the ""grammar police"" which isn't right because ""police"" would refer to a group of more than one person. I'm a grammar policewoman. At least I know this about myself. I blame this on my grandfather. How dare he teach me how to correctly speak English! 

I didn't believe it when my ex called me a perfectionist. I guess it's something I didn't know about myself until he pointed it out. After he said it, I caught myself editing a journal entry for 3 ' and an ""-ed."" I tend to do the same thing with my work. I'll often call something finished and then go back and change half of it. I can never just have anything as is. But it is great news for all of my clients, right? Of course it is.  

I love driving a standard, because my sisters can't do it. Plus, it's just more fun. Standard are just awesome. 

I'm still the queen of being barefoot. I just hate shoes. I'm not sure why; I just do. I love wearing pretty high heels though. I think if I had unlimited money, I'd spend quite a bit on cute heels. But, I'm cheap, so they'd be from Shoe Carnival or Payless. 

No one loves their kids more than me, and no one gets more irritated by them either. I'm the kind of mother that's more of a friend than a figure of authority. The one thing I refuse to tolerate is: talking back. It's disrespectful and is unacceptable. I can't figure out how to make them leave the puppies alone, or quit coloring on the walls. I know that as a mother I have a lot to learn. I always wonder where I put that manual of life, because I need it now.

I don't do drugs, and I don't understand how people get so addicted to it. There are worse things in life than smoking pot, so if my friends do it... oh well. I have friends that are pot-heads, and as long as they don't smoke it in my home, it's ok. As for my kids, I better never see them with drugs of any kind, cigarettes, or any beverage you need to be 21 to drink! I think I'd loose it if I caught my sweet  little girls involved in that. And I mean loose it! Windows screwed shut, locked in their rooms indefinitely... I might even ground them from school until I can trust them again. Now, that last part seems a little overboard, but I'm not opposed to home schooling if I had to.

Which leads me to this, if my kids came home from school and tells me the their teacher taught them the words ""gooder, goodest,"" I will have to have a talk with their teacher. Not the same pleasant banter that goes on between old friends. No, more like, my kids will be some embarrassed they will want ot move and/or be home schooled. I'm not limiting myself on this same type on conversation for any other school-related teaching problems. Though, I will let the fact that Columbus didn't actually discover America slide. 

I try to remember everything. I know this may seem trivial, but to me it's a necessity. I don't want to forget who I was before, and how I changed along the way. But more importantly, I don't want to forget the people along the way. I still look at my yearbooks to see if I can remember their names. Some of these faces are nameless to me, but I know I had classes with them. And I wonder what it was I've forgotten about them. Did we have English together? Did I ever say,""Hi!"" Were there times I could have been nicer to them? But not everyone is in the yearbook. Jeff, Sean, Donald, Lex, Kevin, Carry, Steven, Teresa.... I know I forgot things about them along the way. But, at one time, these people were more precious than life to me. How did we all lose touch? I guess distance does that to everyone, no matter how hard you try to not let it affect you. I would change that if I could.

I get jealous when my exes move on. I know that is the stupidest thing ever, but part of me wants to be irreplaceable. The rest of me is happy they finally did. I know this is by far the weirdest thing about me, because I've been with Raymond for over 5 years now. Why do I care if all my exes get married off? Maybe I'm not jealous that they moved on so much as I mind that they got married before me. Here I am with two kids and they don't have my last name. Why? Because I don't have their father's last name. Well, maybe it's partly that. And it's not all my exes, it's really just one, well two. One isn't really my ex though. One is just a guy I really liked, but never committed to anything. It wasn't my style, to mess around (not to be confused with slept with, because I didn't) with some guy without being his girlfriend first. It was impulsive and fun; yeah, that's not me. I only see him now when someone dies. He always has his pretty wife on his arm. Why did he pick her, rather than me? It had to be the age difference. He was 20, and I was only 16. Until now, this has been a well guarded secret. Only my closest friends knew, and they knew how bad it crushed me inside. But I am jealous.. and wow, they both have the same name. That's funny. But, to be clear, I don't wish that I could have the guys I'm talking about. I guess it really is that I was replaced.. and I'm barely a part of either one's life. 

I don't smoke and I barely drink. I don't like people who are constantly drunk, or being surrounded by a large group of drunks. This is probably why I've never been to a bar, or club. I went inside Spanky's long enough to get my small drink and left before I wanted to once though. It want the music.. the live band. They were singing a cover of ""The Freshmen."" There was something about it, and I couldn't stop starring at the singer, and he was looking back. I was the only person in the small room actually listening to him, and I know he knew it. Maybe it's just me making myself feel important again. I'll never know. Raymond kept saying, ""Come on, lets go.. it's late. I have work tomorrow."" 

I love music. I love how there is a song for every feeling I ever have. No one really knows this, but I started loving Match Box 20 in 8th grade. Maybe it was the year they debuted, I'm not sure. But, the first song I loved was 3AM, right along everyone else on the radio. I had trouble sleeping back then, and for some reason, I never knew who performed the song. At the end of 8th grade, and two schools later, I was with Felicia Pruett (I can't believe I remembered her name.. it's been years) where she played ""Back 2 Good."" At the time, I felt like no one really knew me. No one really did, because I was in my third school of the year. The song really meant something to me, and I still love it. The second CD from Matchbox 20 came out around the time my sister moved out. The third CD came out, and it meant nothing to me. I guess the point is, you can often tell how I feel by what I am listening to. If it's upbeat, I'm happy.. Slow, haunting songs usually mean I'm either sad or reminiscent of the past. 

I can't spell well, at all. I never have been great at it. I'm just glad there is spell check so I don't feel like a retard sending out emails, etc, with about a million misspelled words. 

***Note to self*** There's more, but I noticed the time and have to go. I still have to proof and edit it later."

"event","I started talking to my ex-boyfriend again. Part of me really misses him, but it's the old him. It's part of him that changed with the years we didn't speak. I guess I just miss my old friend. The person I could talk to without explanation. What happened to that guy? 

I know everyone changes; I have too. But a few days ago, before he IMed me, I was thinking how great it would be if he and I could be friends again- before it got all messed up. Just to have that old friend back that knew how to make me smile, and sometimes blush. It's just gone now, and the friendship we will have won't be the same as it was before. It truly makes me sad to know with certainty that it's gone.  

I always wanted to tell him, ""Sorry I hurt you."" I finally got my chance. I'm not sure if he knows how sorry I am. He probably believes me to a degree, but I don't think he'll ever know how much. And he hurt me too, it wasn't like he was completely innocent of all offenses.

I can't believe all of the things he confessed to me last night. I've moved on years ago, but hearing things that happened that he either neglected to tell me, or flat out lied about just hurts. I wasn't in tears when he told me, it just made me lose my breath for a minute. I never would've believed that he cheated on me, or that he lied to me about being a virgin. I guess I didn't know him that well then either, not as well as I thought I did, anyway. It's almost as if my past is a lie. Things I thought to be true, just aren't anymore.

I just wish that someday everything will be as it was. One day, he'll quit saying ""Sarah is hot!"" and ""I love my wife"" to say something more like: ""Ray, your my friend, and I know it's not the same; it could be better than the past."" And I don't have to keep saying, not like that... I know you love your wife. I wasn't hitting on you. Because now, it doesn't feel as easy as it was before to just be. Before it was natural and the playful banter was awesome. Now I have to watch what I say, and how I say it. It's more awkward now.

I hope he's as happy as he's saying he is. It would be great to know that he finally found someone who understands him completely, even if she hates me. But maybe I deserve it. They look so happy together, like they were meant to be. I would just hate to know if he gets hurt again. 

And now that I've written this, I hope he never finds out that I did. I guess its just weird to think he'd be in my head again. But what are the odds, right?"

"event","I hate puppies! To those of you that have never shared a home with eight, now seven*, puppies, YOU WILL NOT GET IT!!! With that said, there is a difference between a cute little puppy and little monsters. I bet you're just dying to know! This is it: ""one."" One puppy is cute and adorably bad. One is precious. Seven UNPLANNED puppies taking up residence in your bathroom is hell! 

Really, it's my own fault I have all these puppies. I was a little too cheap to get the dog snipped. Now, I couldn't pay enough money to get it done. The smell of puppy piss haunts me. 

The bathroom is a closed room with a decorative hole at the top. I think there was a window there at some point, but my landlord is cheap. I guess my landlord thought this was a great idea, because he built the house. He couldn't have been more wrong. The smell of puppy piss leaks out and infects the other areas of the house. 

There have been times that I had to debate whether I would rather go outside than use my own bathroom. Please keep in mind that I have to clean this nastiness up once a day, and I'm about to step it up to twice a day. I have to remove the old paper and sweep and mop the shit up. Quite literally, I have to mop the shit up. Once more for those who missed it: I HAVE TO MOP UP SHIT!!! 

Then there's the barking. The puppies are quiet for the most part, after they get tired from all the barking, etc. But it seems that one still whines after the other are sleeping. I'll walk in to check on the little monsters, and one is off on the other side of the room. SO, I have to put it with the group to make it shut up. 

I can't wait for them to go. Feb. 1st and they are OUT OF HERE!. I have arranged homes for about half the litter. The rest will find homes at the flea market or Wal-Mart. I'll appeal to the kids and they will sucker their parents in. ""I'll take care of it, Mommy."" Awww.. how sweet. I believe him. He'll take it for walks and remember to feed it. Sure he will. Take the puppy. Take it. He's cute! 

Do you think that little kid really will take care of the puppy? Probably not. His/her mom or dad will be the proud owner of a cute little puppy that destroys the house. But one day, that bad little puppy will grow up to be their best friend. So, I don't feel too bad about it. 

 

*Side story on Runt:

I didn't name the puppy because I knew it might not live. He was about a quarter of the size of the others and Rory, my dog, refused to feed him. He was separated from the pack and left out in the cold. So, I bottle fed him and kept him warm. Little runt would rest his head on my laptop. If you haven't noticed, I named him without naming him. Runt was his name. It was sad to see him go. I cried; we had a small funeral for him. Seven people attended. Yes, there were flowers. 

I think it's hard with any pet you try to save- even those you don't have for long. They find a place in you heart and it makes it even more difficult. Do all dogs really go to heaven? I hope so."

"event","Okay here it fucking is. Part 2 to my December 19th post. I figure I might as well finish and post the end even though no one cares lol. I barely even LOAD LJ anymore, nevermind make ENTRIES in it..... on with the show, unfriend me now, I warn you!

Wednesday, Dec. 4: I got up early, I think around 10am-ish (cuz my dad leaves for work around 9), and I would have a whole day of dehydrating ahead of me. My mom and brother were in the dining room talking- I forget about what though. I got out the supplies from last night, and decided while I cut some peppers up, I was going to finish the tomatoes. My mom said the only outside plug would be the one in the very front of the house where the car port is. Great. So if dad shows up for whatever reason he could get a real good look at it. Ugh. Whatever, usually he doesn't get home until late anyway. I had at least until 6-ish. She asked why I needed to put it outside anyway, and I told her that per online messageboards of gardeners, that drying peppers this way makes a foul putrid stench of fumes fill the house. She agreed that outside would be a great idea. I went in my room and began cutting the long thin medium green curling looking peppers, that my brother said were called Long Hots. Whatever. When I was finished, I went out and arranged them in the dehydrator. My hands were burning like motherfucker now. Every time I checked the dehydrator it was agony cuz the hot air just made the burning worse, and it wouldn't wash off!!! I don't know what I did during this day, but I knowI ended up driving somewhere or another, with the AC on super cold and high, keeping one of my hands over the vents at any time, to numb the stinging. Lets just assume I went to more stores for other things cuz fuck if I know. But I do remember before and after my trip(s), I spent the majority of the day checking on the peppers and wanting to cry each time. Eventually however, the tomatoes got finished. I hid the machine in the back laundry room before my dad got home, and when he did, I forbade him to go back there. The ""long hots"" got done pretty quick, and soon I was drying these big yellowish peppers that I think are those 'banana peppers' or 'pepperchini' or whatever the fucks. They took a while, and again I had to stop drying around 3am so I could finish the next day.   

Thursday, Dec. 5: Soon into this huge production of tomato and pepper drying, I realized how much water these things contain, and they lost A LOT of bulk during drying. I originally had the idiocy to think that 4 mason jars wouldn't be enough just for the tomatoes- but LOL... the huge bag of them left about 1/4 of room at the top of ONE jar. I am SO glad I didn't buy 4 more jars. So today was going to be another produce adventure- as well as the opportunity to buy some other misc things I needed. I sat around and surfed for a bit though, looking up more pepper information online, looking for more tips and trying to identify EXACTLY what those yellowish ones were. I found some pictures of New Mexican Hot Peppers (I think that's what it said) and was happy with that. I also realized a lot of the gardeners who mention drying hot peppers, tell the user to use gloves. But, since they didn't say WHY, I never thought about it before. Well, mental note to self. Then I found out how to cure the burning from those god damn peppers. The chemical in the skin of peppers, capacin, is not water soluable. Well thanks a fucking lot world for letting me know. This means no matter how many times you wash your hands with soap and water, you're fucked. BUT- you can wash with rubbing alcohol (and for mouth ailments, milk or yogurt can fix that). Whee! We have some of that! I got the rubbing alcohol and made sure I got every bit of that shit off of me. Finally some fucking relief! I checked on the peppers so far, and decided to get ready and go buy more of each pepper, jalapeno, mystery yellow things, and the 'long hots'. My dad was at work, and no one else was home. As long as I got back soon enough, all would be good. The only place I remember going is Wal Mart, but I know I went a couple other places for whatever reason. So here I am in Wally World, and I'm in a complicated crouch with a small skirt on, piling peppers into 3 different bags, hoping this time I will have enough to fill the jars a good way. I also needed a good olive oil, so that if my dad wanted, he could soak the tomatoes in it. I wandered over to the oil section and read all the labels on these snazzy looking jars, and chose one. Next up, I needed latex gloves. Ha, those peppers weren't going to thwart me this time!!! Yeah. I figured they would be in the ziplock bag section, but I found nothing, and during my trek down an isle, I saw some Wally World male employee, who if I had to guess, would say he was about 18 or 17, giving me this look. It was the look that I have grown to recognize as the ""I want to ask this girl out"" look. Lord. I walked right by, thinking I was safe from comments, when he says, ""Can I help you find something?"" Grr. Yeah, a hole to push you into. No really, I said, ""Yeah, I need to find latex gloves."" He tells me to hold on and stay put, and he would find out. He runs off. I considered taking off, but I go to Wal Mart all the time, and I didn't need to keep running into apron boy. When he came back he asked which kind I wanted. Kitchen cleaning, or surgery. I said surgery, and he told me they were in the pharmacy section. DAMN! The other side of the store. I say thanks and try to walk there, when he suddenly starts skipping up to me and tries to make small talk. GOD! It was like my whole fucking vacation was putting up with stupid people trying to ask me out, or making some asinine comments. I considered keeping track of each one, but lost count. But aside from the scary mall guy, there was some balding, chubby, 40-something guy in one of the dollar stores commenting how nice I looked too. Ugh, go away... anyway, back to the dork: I spent the entire conversation trying to get the fuck out of it. He asked what my name was, where I worked, did I like it there, what the peppers were for (which by the way he had no comprehension of DEHYDRATOR) and I had to explain a few times that I was just drying them for my dad to use, and I was NOT going to cook them myself. What else... God I just wanted to get out of there so bad I don't remember half of the crap... but the whole thing was just dragging with him trying to find out if I was seeing anyone so he could ask me out... I was hoping he would just ask about a boyfriend so I could lie and say ""Yes, I have a boyfriend."" and leave. But he never asked that, and I am not going to just outright tell every guy who talks to me I have a boyfriend off the bat, because I don't want to be that assuming that they are trying to hit on me. So I stayed quiet with my lie. Eventually I managed to slowly walk towards the pharmacy, and told him at some time I actually have to get home before my dad does so he doesn't see his present. He finally relents. As I am walking away thinking ""YES I got rid of him!"" and ""YES he didn't ask me out!"" when I hear, ""Can I maybe have your phone number, so we can talk sometime?"" AHHHH GASP, SHUDDER, CONVULSIONS! GOD! What in the HELL was he thinking? I am going to be 24 soon, and he I swear was still in fucking high school! Like I would ever date a minor! Not to mention he works at WAL-MART!!! Now unless you're a supermodel, in which case you wouldn't BE at such an embarrassing job, you don't got a chance! And talk sometime??? Talk? You mean in the self-denial ""No, this girl isn't chewing her arm off trying to get away from me, she really likes me back..."" kind of talk? Ugh! So finally I whip out my lie, ""Uh, I have a boyfriend."" SCORE! He looks defeated, says he is sorry, and slithers back to stacking cans. OYE. So finally I get to the pharmacy and find my gloves. I pay for my shit, and then drive home. I take care of the peppers, and cut up all the new ones. I hid the dehydrator in the laundry room again and restocked it. The peppers dry a lot faster than the tomatoes, so I figured by late tonight I would only have the jalapeno's left. I was right. 

Friday, Dec. 6: I woke up amazingly late on Friday, if I remember correctly, like 3pm or something. Today was jalapeno day, and getting ready for pre-christmas. Some of our relatives in Gainesville were coming down on Saturday for early xmas, and I helped my dad cook things for our way-too-big dinner. I made the famous and deliciously awesome banana bread, and poured the batter into a cupcake pan instead of making a 9x5 loaf. They turned out perfect. I helped with other stuff, but I completely forget what. Since friday was pretty boring except for the cooking and doing my nails, I will take the time out to explain our xmas tree. I forgot what day we actually bought it... I think it might have been Sunday morning? Hm... well whatever day we got it, I woke up around noon or so, and it was already here. My mom, brother, and grandmother went and bought it at Lowes at like 9am. By the time I got up, I had missed the big show. My mom bought a tree stand at Target on Black Friday, that was supposedly tip-proof, and held trees up to 10 feet. Ahem. Well, when I walked out into our back living room, the tree was on the ground. When the 3 stooges set up the tree, it turns out it was too big even for the tree stand of the gods, and it fell over, LMFAO!!!! I wish I could have seen that! The tree was fucking massive. around 10 feet high, and SUPER WIDE. It was either THE biggest, or the second biggest tree we ever had. My mom and grandmother were very happy that they convinced the guy at Lowes to give it to them for 50$ instead of like 80$. Swindlers. My brother had to go to work though, so he couldn't fix it, and the tree was just laying there with my mom and g-mother staring at it thinking of ideas. They came up with the plan to buy sandbags, and putting them over the weak sides of the stand, lol. God. Hilarious. So I think during the time before I went to the mall on Sunday, thats what they were doing. Hm. Funny how I keep remembering shit about Sunday- the day I remember the least about. But when my dad got home, they managed to get it back up again with the sand bags. All was well until a couple days later they started seeing it tilt more and more, and they tied the opposite side of the tilt to something in our fireplace, lol! So our tree is barely fighting gravity. I think its the funniest fucking thing. Anyway... Back to the actual day of Friday- after cooking and doing my nails, mom came home and we went over all the stuff to prepare for the next day. I think I spent the rest of Friday DLing music in my bro's room, and when he got home I surfed until LATE. The relatives were going to be at my house at 11am, and I went to bed at around 4 something. 

Saturday, Dec. 7: I woke up at like 10:30. I was in a semi-rush to do my morning routine, and the troops arrived at the house at like 10:55. We haven't seen my Aunt Bobbi-Anne, Uncle Ray, and our cousin Jay and his family for a couple years or so, maybe less... but Jay's spawn sure did grow a few inches, and they turned into little smartmouths. They are the kind of kids who are shy pretty much all the time, but when they do speak, it's something scathing in that childish way, that makes you wish they would just hide under the couch again. They annoyed the shit out of me, but I dealt with it. We had an early present-opening ceremony and after dinner everyone dispersed to their own corner of the house. My bro was in his room with Lindsay and all the kids, teaching them one by one how to play Grand Theft Auto 3 or some shit like that. I was in my room either watching some wonderful HBO series or surfing. The day was not very eventful. I had one day left of my vacation... :::drum-roll:::

Sunday, Dec. 8: I think this time I woke up late, but I don't remember, this happened months ago, it's like freakin April 16 now lol. God I suck. What I do remember however, is we went to Wal-Mart (again) to get some stuff for the upcoming week, and when we got home my Aunt Andrea was over with Kayla. I promised Kayla (who is like 12) I would do her nails (because I do my own acrylic nails) to save her $30. It took longer than I thought, but they turned out nice. Afterwards we needed dinner. We didn't have anything stocked up to make, so I told everyone how good that KFC 3 piece meal was, that deal they had for like $2.99 or whatever? So I said I would take everyones order and go get one for everyone. Well me and Kayla drive down to KFC and are in the drive through, and it turns out that they are no longer doing the meal. Well what the fuck. So we had to pull up in front and go inside, and ordered like fucking $35 worth of food for the mini army at home. But, it was fucking good... I wish I hadn't given up fast food sometimes! But that is all I remember of Sunday, now let's get to Monday so I can end this fucker and people can stop un-friending me again for making way too long entries. 

Monday, Dec. 9:  Okay, this technically isn't a vacation day, cuz it was my first day back at work after 11 days of wonderfulness. I am only mentioning it because at the time, Switchboard was hiring another person, and it turned out to be Chad, who is the nephew of CallTech's owner- who's name I do not remember... Todd something? Price I think, Todd Price.. Anyway, I was the trainer for Switchboard, and it was so awkward... at the time I didn't know Chad at all, how he reacted to typically offensive jokes so to speak, esp about our company lol... so I had to watch what I said for the few days I was training him, and it sucked. Plus, I didn't know if Jared (our supervisor) made it common knowledge who Chad was, or if he just told ME, so I didn't even know if I could mention it to people or Chad himself. Bah, it kind of sucked, so I was happy when training was over and I could go be an ass at my own desk. 

Oh by the way, Switchboard.com at Calltech doesn't exist anymore. Me and a few others got routed over to the Gosolo project, which is just as easy, but a tad bit busier than I was used to... I mean when you don't do jack shit for a year and get PAID for it, you notice things like a tripled call flow. But it matters not. Now I am off to disappear again (or maybe not, but I'm covering my ass)."

"event","I am making a real journal entry. Wow. I have only been gone for like a year, lol. Yyyyyeah. During Thanksgiving weekend I started my vacation. 11 days total thanks to the 4 day weekend head start. It was wonderful. Prior to leaving I thought I was going to get calltech-sick or bored but no no noooo no. In fact I was pretty busy the whole time. I can't really remember what I did the entire time, but lets see if I can recap the days of November 27 - December 9. I kept an ongoing notepad document on my work comp to type this shit out when bored- which explains why it is so fucking late, but its my journal and I'll be late if I want to! (this will be long- might want to un-friend me now, lol): 

Thursday: Thanksgiving. Spent the day at home with my immediate family + my bros GF and ate dinner. This was a strange Thanksgiving because usually all my relatives show up, but nearly everyone had to be somewhere else. My aunt (Andrea) and my cousin (Kayla) had to go to... uh... someplace for a cheerleading competition. Her other daughter Kristen had moved months earlier to Lakeland.  My other aunt (Holly) and her son (John) was eating at a friends house.  My grandmother and her significant other ate over my Uncle Peter's house (who we do not associate with due to what he did to Holly and John) because he was mad she always chose our family over him. Ha ha, ass. It wasn't the greatest day ever. Kind of boring. Later on my mom whipped out those store ads and we began to make a game plan for the next day- Black Friday. We were going to get up before dawn and go shopping! After we forced my bro and Lindsay to make a list, we were all set.

Friday, Nov. 29: Got up at 4:30 in the fucking morning. I hadn't been up that early in years, unless I had stayed up the whole night to beginwith =). I didn't take my jacket spite the fact it was fucking freezing that morning. I kind of figured it would warm up, or that it wouldn't be so bad once we got inside the stores. God what an ass! Lets just say I should have taken the damn thing. We hit every major store, and got almost everything on the lists. The day didn't wind down until almost 12 hours later. At 4:00 ish we had just left Best Buy and headed home. I began to nod off in the car, but kept snapping out of it, so by the time I got home I wasn't all that tired. After wrapping presents for hours, I still wasn't tired, so I signed online and stayed up till around 2:30 wasting my life before I was tired enough to sleep. Hmm sleeeep.

Saturday, Nov. 30:  This Saturday is one of the only days I can remember during my 'vacation' that I spent the whole day doing nothing. I woke up around noon I think, and went into my bro's room to use his high speed connection on his comp, and DL music off Kazaa for about 7 hours. That was awesome.  My bro got home from work around 8 and I went back into my room to again play on the comp. Lindsay didn't feel like going to the movies... that bitch... so we ended up going to her house instead and watching a DVD as her psycho dog ran around the whole time being a pain. 

Sunday, Dec. 1: I don't really remember what the hell I did this day exactly, but I do Remember I went to the mall. I was there for only one thing really, at the Perfumania store. My grandmother wanted some odd shit made by Givenchy, and I wanted to see if they had any good deals- keeping me from having to order it online. Now like I said I don't remember what I did for the most part of Sunday, but I got to the mall late. I think around 7. Little did I know, whatever time it was when I got there, the mall was closing in 3 fucking minutes. So as I walked hurridly through it, hoping that big gate for the perfume store was still up, everything was closing, and the 4 people left were leaving. Motherfucker. I rounded the corner where that overpriced DOTS booth is, and saw that yes, the god damn perfume store was closed. But I didn't want to look like a total ass and do an about-face and leave, so I went to the soda machines across the hall from it, and fished for money. Well I ended up looking like an ass anyway cuz I didn't any change, or singles. Grr. I turned and began to leave... but not before some weirdo 40-something guy with a stupid grin on his face decided to say to me, ""Hello Beautiful"" as I walked past. I gave my typical response- a humoring smile and a nod (sometimes I even say thanks to the scary people) and left. Bah. I forget everything else, but I ended up online eventually.

Monday, Dec. 2:  I got up surprisingly early, probably around 10, and I went to visit my mom at work. But, I realized once I got there and asked for her, she wasn't working that day. God damn. She was at Sanibel instead. I remember some of us talking a few days back about how Publix has this xmas tree up front with paper angels on it that a charity group set up for kids who's families (if they had one) couldn't afford presents (or not much). Each angel belonged to a kid, who listed like 3 things they wanted. They were almost all fairly inexpensive things, so I chose two of them. The items they wanted seemed easy to find, especially once I entered the dollar store down the road. It was a large one with a huge selection, with lots of toys. Perfect. I ended up picking out a few things for each kid I had an angel for, and bought even more shit once I saw how much stuff the other kids had asked for was at this place. So I ended up buying I think around 20$ of items. I then went back to Publix, and got more angels. Now I had 5. I went out shopping to all the other dollar stores in the area, and when I couldn't find what this one kid wanted at any of them, I ended up at Kmart and found it there- but not after running into Krasner (the boy who wouldn't bathe at calltech), I don't remember if his first name was Dan or David. Oh well. He works there now and ended up as the cashier for my line. Oh the irritation. I was so happy when some guy got in line behind me cuz then I had an excuse not to sit there and listen to his crap. Once I got home, I had a shitload of things to wrap, and it was around 7pm. I had spent a good portion of the day shopping. My mom was home by then and I told her what all the presents I had were for. She admitted she didn't think I would be the type to do something like that, cuz I hate kids and would die before letting myself be pregnant. No, seriously- and for every fucker to tries to rebut me, do you realize, that is like me saying you will one day change your religion? Or one day, you will grow out of being hetero and turn gay? So shut the fuck up- sorry, it had to be said... anyway...). Well yeah, but being cold hearted and evil has limits. Besides I wanted to be a huge show off, and walk into Publix with 7 angels and a mountain of presents. So my mom ended up telling anyone who she happened to talk to about what I did, which in turn inspired THEM to go out and get some angels. Lordy. So mom helped me wrap and sort through who got what. It turned out some things got mixed up in all the shopping, and I had 3 extra items, and one kid I couldn't get anything for. I figured I would get more angels and put the other kid back the next day. The rest of the night was uneventful, and I ended up online somewhere in there.

Tuesday, Dec. 3:  Mom told me that Publix was doing some sort of Holiday Fest thing, and each department was going to have people out giving out food samples. I was told to be home at 3pm, so I could help my mom get ready. Oye. I woke up around noon again, got ready myself, and planned on taking my car to Publix as well, so she can help me carry in the presents I got. My mom got home soon after and I dolled her up. We went to Publix was was busier than hell and teeming with fucking people. I put the presents under the tree and put the one angel back, and got 2 others. So now I was at 8. After that, I helped my mom set up for this holiday fest shit. Now, I am stick thin and didn't have a cart and *I* was having trouble getting through this store. There were stations set up everywhere and every old person in the Cape Coral area was there. Some of our family was showing up too, but didn't see them yet. I went over to produce then, cuz I had to finish one of the last presents I was working on. My dad has been moaning for ages that he wanted dried tomatoes and peppers to cook with, so I stole his dehydrator and bought a shitload of tomatos and began dehydrating them in my room. Oh, I think I just inadvertently remembered what I did on Sunday... bought the tomatoes... oh well- ANYWAY. So here I am in produce with a huge bag of 3 kinds of peppers, more tomatoes, and a set of mason jars to store the end product. I didn't think I had enough money to buy it all after spending around 40$ on those kids, so I got an idea. I pushed and shoved my way to the bakery section and found a friend of my moms handing out some pastry shit. I asked her to hide my groceries behind the counter for me so I could hit the ATM out front. Of course she helped me out. I rule like that. On my way to the ATM, I found my grandmother and Al. They both commented on me getting even more friggin' angels, and I told them I would be right back after I got more money. I didn't see them for the rest of the day however. When I got back with some cash, I retrieved my items hidden in the bakery and checked out. On the way home I again stopped at the dollar store and got a few more things for the angels to go with the presents I had at home. Then I finally went home. I hid everything that was for my dad under the covers of my bed and forbade him to enter my room. I then set myself up on the floor to wrap up the remaining presents, and prepared for another trip back to Publix. This was probably my most busy day with exception of that Black Friday fiasco. Anyway, I get back to Publix and end up parking in the same spot I had gotten before, right next to my moms car. I once again carry a plethora of presents through the Publix doors. Immediately I wince. They had a band set up in the front of the store with huge speakers, blaring christmas music. After wiping the blood from my ears, I put the presents under the tree with the rest. As a last second notion, I decided to visit my mom again. She was still guarding a sample station, and as soon as I walked up, I saw someone from Callhell. Kelly was with his wife and spawn with his back to me, and his badge necklace hanging out of his back pocket. I thought I would be smooth and sneak up and steal it, but as I pulled the obnoxious red string, it was stuck! So I gave it a few good tugs while I could before he turned around, and I knew it must have looked like I was jerking off his ass. A few seconds later he turned around and I admitted my defeat in stealing his badge, and I was introduced to his family, and then I introduced him to my mom. The meeting was fleeting however, he wandered off to the free booze samples. I stood there idly chatting and going over my busy as fuck day, when then I saw my two cousins (Kayla and Kristen) with my aunt not far behind (Andrea). We all ended up hanging out at the store for over an hour. We kept joking that we were my moms support team. About 4 of the store and department managers were hanging out where we were also and my mom introduced me, and realized she must have a lot of fun at work, because they are all crazy. When this middle school band came in to play christmas songs for people, they set up RIGHT BEHIND us which prompted us to make endless jokes under our breath, but no one was worse than Gene the assistant store manager- who joked that he should request Lynard Skynard. Eventually I figured I should get home because I had all that produce to dehydrate. I said my goodbyes and went home. My dad was in the recliner watching tv, and I got a towel from the bathroom closet, and with it hid a cutting board, plastic wrap, a knife, and paper towels and went in my bathroom to begin this process. I washed the mountain of produce in the sink, piling it into the towel to dry off. Then I snuck into my room and started cutting the tomatoes and placing them on the paper towels to drain. When done with those I filled the dehydrator trays. I had just enough tomatos to cover all three layers. I plugged the thing in and began to play music (which I did until very late) so my dad wouldn't hear the machine. I sat around looking at the peppers and figured I could probably start cutting them up, but thought against it, I didnt want them all open to the air until they can be dried. But, there were a group of peppers I got where I wasn't sure if they were Jalapeno or not (I typically avoid hot foods, and am not really fond of peppers to begin with, so sue me for my semi-ignorance). So I cut the top off of one, and gave the stem piece a tiny taste. Well.... that was a fucking huge mistake. It seemed my mouth instantly flooded with lava, and as calmly as I could tried to remedy the situation. I must have washed my hands and lips 20 fucking times, but my skin was still burning. I was so fucking annoyed. I figured it would go away eventually, and I went online to see any tips for drying peppers. Until around 3:30 I checked the tomatoes every two hours, removing the dried ones. I had about one layer of tomatoes left that were still smushy. I knew though, that I didn't start it soon enough, and that I would have to continue tomorrow, so I unplugged the dehydrator, and went to bed.

I miss my watch. My mom got me this cheapo glowy face thing a few years back, and the wristband snapped. Now I got a problem. Getting the thing fixed would probably cost more than it cost itself, but, I like THAT watch, and I haven't been able to find one just like it. Blah! Cry.

Please no one ever mention anything personal to me ever again.

By the way, I am removing comment ability. I don't want some comment war invading my space. 

However- I must add that this revelation was just made known to me, so I was blisfully unaware of how old it was or not. Also, setting the record straight is hardly being insecure. 

So anyway, excuse me for not wanting a potential friend that I will also be working with for the next X many months to think ill will of me for something I never did. Cuz really, aside from that individual and people who claim to be my friends, I couldn't give a shit what anyone else thinks."

"event","Today on the way to work was horrible. As I was leaving the Cape side toll and headed towards Fort Myers, I had this compulsive urge to look over at the cars leaving the other booths. There was a cop right next to me. UUUGH! I had to drive all the way to the colonial/41 intersection going the speed limit. The amount of self control I had to utilize was painful. I didn't know I had it in me. I'm too similar to Mike (uninvention) when it comes to driving. Both with incurable road rage. I need speed, danger, sharp curves, loud music. I am almost convinced I am car-crash invincible. I have been in around 5 or 6 car accidents of varying seriousness (only two of which I was driving at the time, and only 1 of the two was my fault) and came away each time without a scratch. Well, okay the egging-limo night I did get some scrapes on my face and neck from the airbag, but for walking away from an 80mph crash into a ditch with no seat belt on- thats nothing. Bah. Cops suck. It's almost like they're mad for having to ""protect"" us. 

Now a word from our sponsors:

Once we were lovers 
Just lovers we were 
Oh what a lie 
And once we were dreamers 
Just dreamers we were 
Both you and I 

Now I see you're just somebody 
Who wasted my time 
and money 
What a lie 
You and I 

What about your 
your 10 000 promises 
That you gave to me 
Your 10 000 promises 
that you promised me 

Once I could handle the truth well 
the truth was you and I 
But time after time all the 
Promises turned out 
To be your lies 

So now, now I see your just somebody 
who wasted my time
and money 
what a lie 
you and I 

You said I'll take you back 
But I'll close the door 
Cause I don't want...
10,000 more 

Once we were lovers 
Just lovers we were 
Oh, you and I 
What a lie"

"event","Okay, that shit I said earlier about not having it any better, okay I take it back. I've ran into the recent luck of getting by on looks for the past few days. I can't recall all the events because honestly I am fucking dead tired, but, here goes. Earlier last week, Monday actually, I was doing my routine speeding to work, for no other reason than loving speed. I love to speed. I hit midpoint bridge, and get stuck behind a shitty looking ass-red cutlass with out of state plates, DRAGGING FUCKING ASS. I will tell you right now- NEVER DRIVE SLOW IN FRONT OF ME UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE! Especially on midpoint- where the right lane is crammed bumper to bumper (because those people are fucking retarded), but I end up in the left lane with only ONE car ahead of me- dragging ass, natch- with open space for miles in front of them. So this cutlass was looking for death. I pull up behind him going about 80, jerking the car forwards, hoping to drive his slow ass into the right lane and out of my way. FINALLY he gets the hint and fucks off, and I proceed to speed past him. I get around the main curve of the bridge, and suddenly this motorcycle cop is up my ass trying to pull me over. SNARL. I pull over, wishing I had a radar detector. The shitty part is, I got a speeding ticket last March (60 into 40) and I knew I would have to take the points for whatever this cop dished out. So he starts coming over to my car, and I try to act as clueless and doe-eyed as possible. Fast foward- he only ended up giving me a moving violation for tailgating, and not the MV+ speeding ticket package for going 70 into 55, which he said would have been almost 200$. Well well... makes me wonder if I had applied all of my lipgloss if I would have gotten off totally scott-free... ANYWAY- today I went into the breakroom and our vending machine stock boy was shoving chips into the top shelf, and he was getting ready to close it when I askesd if he could put a package of the cheese crackers up front instead of the peanut butter ones. He digs around looking for a cheese one, and ends up just handing it to me. I was secretly thrilled at this, because I was 5 cents short of 50 cents and didn't want to break a new dollar and have even MORE change. So I said my 'thank you's and enjoyed my free package of yellow dye #7 and dehydrated cheese. There was more stuff but like I said I don't remember. 

I also wanted to acknowledge to myself that its November 11!!! This started being significant back in high school, when me and my best friend Mel had this habit of always looking at the clock when it said a certain time. Hers was 10:17, and mine was 11:11. We decided to have more fun with our times, and adopted the days to match. So each 10-17 or 11-11 we try to do something fun or memorable. For the past 11-11's I have done fun things, except for last year. Last year I am almost positive I was working on the Bellsouth project and praying for death (it wasn't until a week or so later I got the Switchboard project). But this year, today, hasn't sucked exactly, but I AM at work- and to make things worse... until I made a journal entry in one of our systems accounts and actually saw ""11/11/2002"" as the date, I completely forgot about it!!!! Gasp. But still, all is good. Even if I do have points on my license."

"event","Today is starting out extremely good. I don't even mind the fact that I had to take 3 calls and I have only been here and hour and a half. It started out last night actually: I was kicking major ass in Mario RPG, when my brother and his GF Lindsay walks in my room to tell me the news. 

For the past week we have been trying to organize a trip to Busch Gardens for their version of Horror Nights (I forget what it is called and too lazy to go to buschgardens.com and look. It's like Howl-o-scream or some shit). Two years ago we went to Universal Studios Horror Nights and it was great fun- so worth the money. Anyway, none of us felt like driving that far for it this year- esp since my brother said that last years sucked because of 9/11. I thought the idea of it being at Islands of Adventure this time would outweigh the possible suckness- cuz COME ON!! IOA!!! IT RULES! Ahem. So I, by accident, saw a huge ad in the local paper for BG. I pestered him to go. Then Lindsay helped me pester him to go (he is so cheap and likes saving money more than doing fun things). Well we won. But until last night we had no solid go-date because on each of its last days of running, someone had to work. Well, as the amusement park gods have it- we worked it all out. So tonight, I am leaving work early, and we are going to have great fun at BG Howl-o-scream Horror Nights something something- OH! and my aunt said her friend has 2 free passes for it! How fucking rad is that! So now we only have to buy 1 ticket and split the thing 3 ways. 

So then we come to today. After getting some good laughs at some of the employees dressed up (Jennifer as Raggedy Ann, Bruce as Silent Bob, and Andy as the Pillsbury Doughboy), me, Mike and Ben pester Jared to get Brad to buy Switchboard pizza- to celebrate Halloween, and Mike's last day before he takes a 2 week vacation for his Honeymoon. Our scam worked, and in about 40 minutes we are going to have 4 Birdies Pizza's delivered! AWESOMENESS!!! 

And to think, I figured Halloween would suck this year. ::Squeal::"

"event","Man. I hate... no, let me utilize caps here, HATE our janitor here. He is such a lecherous old bag. 

I am not really against any set of people for any reason, and don't encourage stereotypes- I'm pretty damn open minded- probably more than most people. So perhaps I must be hallucinating when it seems every mexican male I have ever met seems to be genetically programmed to be a pig. 

I am hardly ever in the area, thank god, but when I do find myself needing to stop by the North Fort Myers Walmart, (which us in Cape Coral nickname redneck Walmart), there are hoardes of these hooting and comment-slinging mexican males! It's sick. Each time *ANY* human female passes them by, it looks like it takes all their restraint to keep from jacking themselves off right there on the sidewalk.

Which takes me back to our janitor. He is mexican, and old. A great combination for a sexual harassment suit. The women here used to complain about him when Calltech first opened. They said something to our QA manager, Jim, but I don't know if he took any actions. But lo and behold, janitor man is still here regardless. On a daily basis, he wanders the callcenter floor with this pushy-vacuum thing, and periodically he will stop and stand there at the end of each row, and gaze down, staring at any girls there. I always wish I can go on break or lunch or something when I hear him coming, because his behavior drives me up the wall. I make every attempt to ignore him when he is around, and when he does his little staring exercise down my row, I nearly turn my chair around the opposite way to look anywhere thats not in his direction. 

I think half this callcenter has issues with him, not just the stared-at women. A lot of my friends openly bitch when he is around, about him not cleaning the tables in the breakroom. Granted we're not children and should clean up after ourselves after eating, but hey- shit happens. He has a whole room of cleaning products that he nearly fucking guards like a nazi, god forbid he actually USES the windex! 

One time three very good friends of mine said they witnessed him smell the chair that was being occupied by a cute girl after she had gone into the breakroom. WHAT THE FUCK!? Now I have these shudder-worthy imaginings of him licking the fucking toilet seats. Needless to say, I have like 4 layers of toilet paper on those badboys before MY tan ass sits on them. 

GOD! People in general suck. I hate everything >=|"

"event","It's late. I'm tired. I'm mad. I have this compelling urge to rant about somsething due to a recent event. You know what I hate? I hate people that think I have it any better than they do, because of how I look. Fuck that, and anyone who thinks that. I wont be as presumable to speak for everyone who is pretty or hot or whatever, but my life hasn't been any easier in any aspect because of how I look- especially with guys. All my relationships are fucking disasters, I still get speeding tickets, I still have to fish in my purse for 2 cents so I can have perfect change when at the register, I don't get deals when buying something from a small business owner, I don't get free or extra food at concession stands... blah blah and blah. There have been a few times where some drooling fool has been around when I needed something of the above, and gave it to me without asking me to give them the time of day, but it's not very often, and I never really expect it. But it seems everyone else thinks I ride through life, and that I DO expect those things, or even more fucked up, expect them for me? Like I should take advantage of it? What the hell is that about? But want to know why I don't? Or maybe wont, or can't?

What makes me the maddest, is that for the majority of my life I was quite unattractive. Someone who reads this will know the quote I used before, that, somewhere around 3rd grade I woke up having somehow been beaten with the ugly stick... that continued to remain until about 7th grade... even out in 8th, get tolerable in 9th, sink down again in 10th, then began to raise slowly from 11th... through 12th, and into college... where it seemed ever since HS the older I got- the cuter I got. But I never grew out of the mindset of the self consciousness of the ugly version of me. Haunted by the taunts of little mother fuckers also known as peers, being singled out, picked last... I wished and still wish they would just die. 

But hey, a mentionable note would be that with a lot of my enemies- they ended up getting uglier. I remember walking around my college campus, spotting left and right these sorry sacks of flesh that I knew a handfull of years ago that used to be ""the shit"", and now, LOOKED like shit! I would just smirk to myself and walk past, maybe even laugh out loud if they were knocked up. And I don't know if it was honest confusion or not, but, none of them ever recognized me. 

Another thing I just LOOOOOVE is when I am at a gas station, or Wal-Mart, or Micky D's- any humiliating workplace, and I see them working there! I love to get in their line, and just smile innocently as they ring up my groceries, having to smile and tell me to have a nice day. But I am getting into my evil mode, aren't I? 

I just wanted to bitch on how I hate it when people think I have it any better. Everyone is fucked! Chris Hall had it so right when he was screaming the lyrics to ""Save Yourself""! Snort. So give a hottie a break cuz their life probably isn't all hot dates and showering praise."

Last year at Halloween, I was on Bellsouth still, and therefore hated my life. When I found out that Callhell was letting us dress up (within reason) for Halloween (meaning don't come naked) I had little motivation to bother participating. I not only had no clue as what to be, just like EVERY year, but I had no spirit. However, it was- I think- the night before, when I got a great idea for a costume. Technically it wasn't much of a ""costume""... see I was a Serial Killer, and they look just like everyone else. So I had to bring props. I carried a menacing looking knife, and a book. The book was a hardcover novel in which I made a plain white book cover for, but in big black letters it said, ""How To Kill, Filet, and Serve Bellsouth Customers"". Ingenius, no? HA! I was a god damn Bellsouth Customer Serial Killer! YES! I decided to present a photo taken of me pretending to kill a fellow co-worker... but for reasons I wont go into, I hate the bastard, so I kind of wish I DID kill him. Feh. <BR><BR>

OMFG- guess what just happened to me!! FUCK! okay, im sitting here on the comp, and the doorbell starts ringing. NO ONE we know, rings the F'in doorbell. so im like, yeah whatever. so then i hear, -swear to god- ""this is the cape coral police department"". WTF? i thought it was a joke. but i was all UUUGH, and got up. i had to pull some clothes on cuz i was in no means dressed for answering doors, and there is a cop standing there. der? kay... he asks if i was sharon, i say no thats my mom, and he tells me how he found out about 4 kids were stealing peoples mail recently. GASP. i told him that my mom had been suspicious about that, because she ordered stamps that were still not here. kay... and he shows me a pile of opened mail and packages. two of which were ebay auctions i had won, a book and some anime on CD (the whole Tri-Gun series). the thing is just yesterday i mailed the sellers asking where my stuff was (i was nice of course) but i was annoyed. turns out everything got here, it was just stolen! lil fucks! so the officer asked if i wanted to press charges cuz no one else did. i said i sure as hell do. so he is off to arrest some 7, 8, and 10 yr olds. how dare they steal my shit!!! UUUGH! so now i have to mail those sellers and tell them whats up, and of course i didnt get insurance on either item ::fumes:: but the officer said that he may be able to get the items back, or even hold the parents responsible and get my money reimbursment, and he even said i could sue them in small claims. wonderful. i just want my fucking shit back. i can always win another auction from the one guy, but the book i will have to win all over again. oye fuckin vey."

"event","nearly everyone who reads this knows i am no longer with the bellsouth project, but i just thought i would mention it, because i am posting a call i scripted down based on a real call, extremely similar, from over a year ago. i found this reading an old email from a friend who did telemarketing and we were sharing horror stories. anyway- i hate getting those people on my phone who... havent EVER used a computer... havent EVER been online... and are so inbred theyre probably seeing double from being genetically crosseyed... this is kinda long, but mad ass funny: 

Me: ""Thank you for calling Bellsouth Internet Services, my name is Shary, can I have your user ID please?""
Usless Human Being: ""Oh uh, hiya there missy. Um, im sorry but, what is a user aye dee?""
Me: (in this 'oh fuck me, not another one who doesnt know this question' tone, but FORCING it to sound nice) ""Ah, well, your user ID is your Bellsouth email address, but without the @bellsouth.net part attached.""
Useless Human Being: ""Emayle? whats Emayle? I'm sorry missy, my brother gave me this computer when he bought a new one, and I really dont know anything about it... I got this CD are-ohh-em (he meant ROM) in the mail and i thought 'oh what the hey' lets try this online thang.""
Me: (REALLY trying to hide the 'please god strike me with lightning' tone) ""Ohhhh so you dont even have an account yet?"" (grinding teeth).
Useless Human Being: ""No I sure dont there"" (insert redneck laugh)
Me: (in my 'giving up on humanity' tone, but again making it sound nice) ""Well did you try setting up the CD?""
Useless Human Being: ""The whosit what now?""
Me: ""The CD... the one you just got in the mail?""
Useless Human Being: ""OH! OH yeah, I'm sorry missy. Yeah I tried, it wouldnt let me online.""
Me: ""you were disconnected from the 1-800 number the computer tried to dial?""
Useless Human Being: ""well, it wouldnt even let me on the line.""
Me: ""Right. When you got to the last step of the CD, did it try to dial onto the phone line, into an 800 number?""
Useless Human Being: ""Yeah! You know its the funniest thing, it did!""
Me: ""Yeah. So when it did that... what happened, did you get an error message?""
Useless Human Being: ""Hmmm no... but it did make all these really bad noises, it reminded me of when mah dog died.... i loved that dog. A hound dog. He was run over by the tractor by my Pa... I... I... Well I shut the computer off right away! It was such a bad noise!""
Me: (slamming my forehead into the desk of my cubicle) ""You shut off the computer when it was trying to dial into the internet?""
Useless Human Being: ""Of course! It was a bad noise. Why?"" 
Me: (silently begging nelson to kill me as he giggles at me) ""Well thats a normal noise. That is the modem trying to dial up to the internet.""
Useless Human Being: ""Modem? Internet? I'm sorry missy, I really dont understand these big words! I only graduated eleventeenth grade.""
Me: ""The modem is... wait... ok so basically it WAS dialing up?""
Useless Human Being: ""It was?""
Me: ""I wasnt asking... exactly... I meant... I was confirming. The computer WAS dialing, right?""
Useless Human Being: ""Yessiree bob!""
Me: ""Ok. What you have to do, is hang up, and then dial into the internet again, and follow the steps that it tells-"" (here is where I get cut off by the phone dialing a familiar sounding 800 number over the phone line) ""Hello? He... Hello?""
Useless Human Being: ""I'm sorry missy, I was trying to uh, what did you call it, dial in?""
Me: ""Yeah. You have to hang up first, or the connection wont go through."" 
Useless Human Being: ""Ohhh! Gotcha. Thanks for all those good tips there missy!"""

"event","god damn. i totally forgot to mention this on break today- but to make swbd more ""structured"" jim came up with this bright idea for us to schedule breaks and lunches. wtf? why does god hate me? so, my last break is at 4:30. snarl. i am so for the hating of things right now. i only got to take 2 breaks with you! but maybe when you get a break you can sneak down by swbd. you can hide under the desk!!! hehehehe. 

man. this blows. we're putting up with all this pressure just to make calltech look good. fuck them. if they want to look so god damn great, they should eat some of their own bullshit. 

on another note, my brothers friend chris was driving his truck down our street today with my bro in shotgun, and they ran over a kid. they were just driving along, and out of the blue this kid came out of a side street on his bike and just rode right in front of them. there was a lot of people around to witness it, how chris wasnt in the wrong at all. maybe the parents around here will learn something. i swear. i live in a pretty nice 'hood, and theres A LOT of kids here. but, they run around unsupervised constantly! little fucking kids too! i mean we see toddlers out and about with their 7 yr old brothers and sisters watching them. theyre ALWAYS near the edge of their driveways, on bikes and rollerblades, or with their god damn dogs sans leashes. the kid chris hit was 4 yrs old, on a fucking bike, no parents around. this is why the kidnapping rate is so high. i almost want to go on a kidnapping spree just to teach these stupidfuck parents a lesson. i would send them to summer camp or something lol. anyway, this particular victim of ""Darwin Award"" parents was taken away in an ambulance, but from what i hear he wasnt critical or anything. my bro and chris were pretty shook up, but come on theyre 19 yr old immature males, so by the time i got home they were playing some over-realistic football game and laughing in my bros room. 

ok, i am so beyond tired."

"event","I swear, today has just started, and has sucked harder than anything could suck. First I wake up listening to a 9-11 memorial playing on the living room TV. They were listing names of the victims the entire time I was getting ready. Then at the same time as I was brushing my teeth... my best friend, practically a soulmate, is getting wheeled into the prep room for major surgery that was actually scheduled for 9am on 9-11. Gee. What a morning so far. Then I get to work. Lance's little tech buddy is fucking around with my station phone. See, yesterday we had this jackass meeting about our team, and Jim wanted me to sit down with the others, instead of BFE, where I am quite comfortable and happy. My comp works great and has all my settings, and my phone is the best working in this row. I did not want to move, but what could I do. So I look at whatever-his-name-is and ask him if he can move my entire phone system down to the other booth (3 seats down) cuz I know the phone there will crap out. He says okay. He moves my phone, and meanwhile I move my personal stuff and save some shit on my H drive to be xfer'ed over. I sit in my new seat, which already feels ""wrong"". I turn on the comp, set it up, and put on the headset. Un-fucking-believably, there is this static-based whine humming merrily in the headphone. I turn off mute, and try to talk into the mic, and I barely hear myself. WTF? This was ALL MY equipment that worked GREAT on my old booth. Silence in the headphone, I could hear perfectly any voice through it... what was this horse shit? So immediately I start complaining. Lance comes over and fucks with some stuff, and tells me to try it again. Still shitty. So everyone just left me there, and I was FUMING. Just beyond pissed. And I do crazy things when I'm that pissed. I reran these scenarios through my head of standing up, yelling ""FUCK THIS!"" and storming out to my car, exlcaiming I was going to use sick time for the day while they fix my shit the right way. But I didn't. I just sat in MISC2 and fumed. So then Jared comes over. He could tell I was on the verge of a massacre. He tells me it was Jim who had the idea to move me, and he told me I could sit where I usually do, and he would tell Jim that the new booth wasn't fit for working. Jared has been so great these past couple of weeks. I feel so bad for hating him last year. So I moved all my shit to my old seat, where I reside right now. Since going into available, I have stayed available for 1 hour and 2 minutes. Now this is more like it. Anyway, I had to get that out! For a slight subject change, I'm wearing such a cute outfit today. It's red/white/blue... these pants that are so tight they look like white spraypaint, an adorable tank top from venus swimwear, and this long sleeve blue and white stripey shirt that always for some reason (dont ask me why) reminds me of 'Wheres Waldo'. But all together its cute!! Last year on 9-11 I was here just before 9am. I took one Bellsuck call before all our flow went to nill, and I was put on outbounds. A few minutes later, 90% of the call center was sent home. By this time a year ago, I was at the Cape Coral Library, copying pages by hand out of a book, ""How to Write a Damn Good Novel II"". Doesn't seem like a year ago. September 11 has so many bad memories for me now... and man... that final lil jab of the thorn is the fact that now, I will NEVER, EVER be able to forget Calltech."

"event","Man. I'm here at work, just blasted bored out of my mind. I got here at 10am and in the past 4 hours I took 2 calls. One was a wrong number. Switchboard has this new shit going on... my lord I would clog the LJ database if I went into the dramas of the past month. I probably will anyway though, because it's just too wrong. But part of it is, we can't surf now unless we keep up our monitorings to 90% and up. Whatever. Like it takes smoke and mirrors to surf anyway. I sit all by myself, and the only supervisor who walks down this row is Jared, and he couldn't really give a shit. I know I wont become anywhere as addicted to this LJ thing as most of these people, lol, esp the Something Unreal cutie. Who by the way I want to ""publicly"" thank for showing me ever stalkers dream website. I've found out the most crucial information about people. Bastards. Sometimes I'm so ashamed to be part of the human race. What is wrong with people? Feh. That is why that friends list of mine will most likely always remain empty. As of now, two people like me enough to say I am a friend of theirs. Awwwe. And Pragmatic's LJ is downright hysterical. I keep reading it and laughing, and then get all paranoid that someone will question what I am doing (ie Jim). ""Shary are you surfing?"" .. ""Er, no Jim... I was um, laughing at the Source's Crazy Call... Heh... heh..."" snort. So mujch for not posting incriminating evidence. I've gotten so shifty eyed here in the past month. Always making sure no one is watching. It's so melodramatic. But at this job, you have to make up these scenarios to keep your mind kicking. On a total change of subject: I wish LJ let you post past entries. Like use the calendar feature to make an entry that took place in like 1997 or something. Then again, perhaps you can, and I didn't look hard enough. I would hate to look stupid. Too late. So I guess I should also mention I don't know how to make an entry categorize as a memory. Al help me! Hehehe. 

Oh, and because I want to make this long and obnoxious as possible, I am going to post this call I submitted for the crazy call contest here at my job. I havn't won yet. Dammit. 

A call came in on the Switchboard line which I answered with our standard greeting. I asked how I could help her, where she said ""I was surfing your site looking for a listing, and a big window popped up with confetti on it and it said in big letters, YOU ARE THE 9,000,000 VISITOR TO THIS SITE! CLICK HERE TO CLAIM YOUR PRIZE!"" She was very excited and had several friends around her muffled in the background. She continued.  ""It had pictures of a cruise, and a car, and a boat... so I clicked on the ad, and filled out the form on the next screen, but nothing else happened."" Now she sounded forlorn and worried, ""I hope my prize is not lost, is there was anything you could do to redeem it? I swear I'm telling the truth, everyone here saw it!"" By now I had the phone on mute, completely laughing. I was all too familiar with what she described. Switchboard.com used to have pop up ads show up a lot when searching, and one in particular was a flash movie where confetti rained down the screen and had a huge glowing phrase about being the latest visitor, and when you clicked on it, it would take you to a tangled web of sites about signing up for a hundred services and had the chance to enter drawings and whatnot. I had no idea that people would assume they were real. So after cracking up I came back on to say, ""Actually those are called pop-up ads, they are usually too good to be true sayings that trick you into clicking on them to take you to another website. They are not real sweepstakes."" She sounded so disappointed. ""Oh. So if they are not real how come you advertise them?"" She probably thought I was lying and there was some big prize that I was going to try to take for myself. I told her ""Switchboard doesn't endorse the claims, they only sell webspace to for companies to place an ad. Like informercials."" She told her friends in the background what I had said and could hear a collective sigh of disappointment. She told me ""Thank you anyway."" I still laugh to this day."

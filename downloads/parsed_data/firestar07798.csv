Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death

We are so young
our lives have just begun
but already we're considering
escape from this world

and we've waited for so long
for this moment to come
was so anxious to be together
together in death

Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death
Won't you die
Baby join me in death
Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death

This world is a cruel place
and we're here only to lose
so before live tears us apart let
death bless me with you

Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death
Won't you die
Baby join me in death
Won't you die tonight for love
Baby join me in death

this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living

You have experienced<br>great heartbreak and don't feel alive without<br>your love there.

The day has come
I'm feeling that your sun
Shines away from me
 
Tease me
Holding my hands you smile again
I couldn't see you away from me
I do realize it now
 
Living in me
You are living in me
 
You are living in me
 
I feel you by my side
Your living soul wants to run away with me
Inside of me
 
And now
Will something happen to me?
How did I lose my guide?
You left me all alone
 
But now it is to late
I know it is natural but now
What can I do without your presence here?
A never-ending pain
 
Living in me
 
You are living in me
 
I feel you by my side
Your living soul wants to run away with me
Inside of me
 
I feel you by my side
And I'm sure that I can't forget you
You are inside of me
 
You are inside of me

Okay, I am calm

I cannot wait to go home, there is too much drama going on at school and I cannot handle it anymore. It is as though we are all back in high school and we cannot just say sorry or just forgive someone if they do say sorry. Or even just tell people what you are mad at them FOR! It is getting out of control! Seriously!

I have a boyfriend...his name is Will...I like him a lot! I am just taking things as they go for now just because I will be home for three months for summer and I do not know if our relationship is strong enough to survive for that long. I sure hope it is! He wants to move out of Quincy, which I do not blame him but I hope he doesn't. I like hanging out with him and him translating French movies for me! 

Anything else...no...I don't think so...

okay bye!"

"event","Hello everyone,
So, life has been pretty good or maybe I just decide not to recognize the bad things that are happening right now. But, for now I CHOOSE to be happy. I am not going to let problems override my life.

Anyways, school is super busy and the school decided to take away my financial aid so I lost my job. Therefore, I told my dad that he needs to give me money every month because he does not support me and he does not pay child support. He said he would but I doubt it will be much.

Open recruitment is this week and next week and it has been fun. The girls are a lot closer this year and we are all having a lot of fun together. So, that has been great. I also LOVE living in the house because it is cool to see girls come in and out and have a house and not a dorm.

Well, I do not know what else to say right now so if you have any questions call me or ask me,
love,
Katie"

"event","So, I got back into town on Sunday and it was an ok trip except for the tire blow out on Saturday.

My tire decides to blow out and it is a 75 mph road so I pull over to the side and start changing it and a deputy stops to help us (my mom was there too but she was not much help) and we get on our way only being able to go 50mph on the spare. I felt like putting an ""injured"" sign on the back of the car because everyone is whizzing past us especially semis...so we make it to the next town and get the tire changed and head out again.

Besides that it was a fine trip. Now I am home and I am getting ready to start work again on Monday and I have to get a drug test and my fingerprints done AGAIN! You see I work at a Mortgage Company and they do that kind of stuff. I am not looking forward to it. Plus, I do not like the woman I work with but it is 10 dollars and hour and it is full time. I need the money.

Well, I am off to be lazy or do something...peace!"

I drove there and back...it was about two and 1/2 hours or so and everyone but my roommate slept on the way there and everyone slept on the way back so I sang Rent songs on the way back to keep myself awake. I broke my nail on the 'Batman' ride today (the first ride we went on) and it was not like a normal break were it just sucks...no...it started bleeding and I cannot straighten my finger all of the way, I do not know how I am going to sign my final  tomorrow!

On the way back I saw an old broken down truck on the side of the rode and it reminded me of 'Jeepers Creepers' truck!!! That entertained me for a little bit.

Overall it was a really good time! It definitely was not as good as Disney Land/California Adventure or other places...it was pretty small. I won a Superman cape and that is all that matters!! I am such a weirdo...lol!

Now I need to write two papers for my finals for tomorrow! Love you all! MUAH..."

So ""suck my dick"" boy called me last night wanting me to 'hang out and chill' I of course said no. I just cannot do it without a relationship. When he talks to me like that I feel like he wants to use me and I am cheap and a slut and a hoe. I haven't done anything with him and I feel that way. YUCKY!! 

Why can't I just have a relationship with someone so that he will get off of my back and I can cuddle with someone. Kill two birds with one stone!"

We went out to lunch then we went Christmas shopping...it was a lot of fun! Then I got really tired so I decided what I wanted for dinner (porkchops, corn, and rolls) and then we went to Baskin Robins and picked up an icecream cake. We went home and my brother came over and we had dinner together. 

Presents: my mom got me a book ""The Art of Amy Brown"" which is all faries, some earrings, and some perfume. My brother gave me a ceramic pot that he made...it is really cool. 

I felt dishearted when I did not have a party for my birthday because I have never had a birthday without a party. I did nothing with my friends...Michelle Ocamica called me but we did nothing together. A lot of people from Quincy and family called me. I got around 30 messages on my facebook from people. That felt good. 

I have realized that this year was a really good one. I moved schools which turned out to be the right decision, I got drunk for the first time, and I had a boyfriend for the first time. I even had two! Chris lasted only four days but Derek and I are still going strong. I miss him a lot...my mom had a thing of balloons and a teddy bear sent to me today and she told me to name the teddy bear ""Derek"" and I did. I told him that and he laughed. I miss him...

So, I am looking forward to a great year being 20! Wow...20...I am so old!!

I went to see Rent with Kevin and Katie and Liz, there were all of these Quincy University kids there because it was the first day that it opened in Quincy (stupid little towns). A few rows back from us there were four girls who live on my floor. Hannah, Bridget, Hailey and Hailey's sister. At one point before the movie I heard the name Derek Hauk...(my boyfriend)...my ears zoom in and I heard ""and girlfriend""...eventually I hear ""he obviously does not love her""...and then I hear ""she better not turn around and try and talk to us...all she is is AOII or die""...(laughter)...""ya...AOII or die""...""Well, Hannah that means you have to die""...(more laughter)

A little side note...Hannah rushed for AOII but was turned down (second time). 

I became furious...Kevin heard it too because after the beginning ""Derek Hauk"" he turned to me and said ""did you hear that too?""

I wanted to get out of my seat and fucking punch them...they are always so nice to me in the hallway and everything and then they fucking like to stab you in the back!!! I hate them...they need to die!!!

Then I went to Sarah L.'s house and had some pudding shots and some Snead Cider. Then had to go home because I had work in the morning. 

Morning of October 30th-woke up and could not swallow so I called in sick and went back to sleep until I had to go do play stuff at 2:30. Finished that and then got ready to go to Jacksonville with Dominique.

Evening of October 30th-Drove to Jacksonville and saw my friends and Tranice (who moved away from Mac also). That was a lot of fun. Then we got ready and went to Bogarts and danced and had a good time. Then, we went to K-mart's house which was filled to the max with people and I was in a little corner downstairs in the basement. We danced and then two guys came downstairs and one was yelling ""Where you goin, where you goin"" *smashes the other man into a speaker and speaker falls* ""I'm gonna pop you"" *proceeds to take out gun* *crowd falls silent* *both men run back upstairs* Then we were told to leave 'duh' then when we got upstairs there were literally 8 cop cars outside and they were yelling at us to hurry and just go home. So, we went to the wrestling house. We hung out there and Dominique played beer pong and Abby was all up on some guy she likes and I was just standing there. After like an hour, I was ready to leave because there was so much smoke (both cigarrette and weed) that my lungs felt suffocated. I said that I wanted to leave and they left with me but on the way back Abby and Dom were giving me crap about leaving because they were having a good time and did not want to leave and I told them that I did not care and they could go back. They walked back with me to the dorm then got themselves refreshed and then went back over there. It was like 5 o'clock in the morning!!! Oh, well, so the next day Dom and I got ready and said goodbye and went bac to Quincy. 

Evening of October 31st-After play practice I went back to my room and got ready for Danny's Halloween party. Then Suzanne and I went and saw a bunch of people that we knew and hung out. It was fun. I had some wine and it was very nice. Derek was there and I still do not know if I want to go out on a date with him or not. He was kinda touchy with Stephanie...I do not know. So, it was fun, I just talked with a bunch of people and listened to music. Then some eggers egged the house and a bunch of places on campus so we called secerity. Then when Derek left he was saying goodbye and a lot of people had already left. He gave Samantha a half hug then John a hand shake then for me *I was not at hugging range* he grabbed my hand and I thought that it was a handshake but then he took it to his mouth and kissed it!!!!! Oh, *sigh* I do not know if that was anything at all but I really enjoyed it! I am too sentimental and I care about the little things too much. Oh well.

Wed, Thur., Fri., and the last night is tonight. It is going ok, this theatre is sooo much more lax then any of the other theatres that I have worked in. They do not do vocal warmups and oh my gosh the list goes on...It is fun though, there is a good cast and good crew and directors. Last night the cast and crew went to the 18 Wheeler (a truck stop that sells pancakes 24 hours a day) and I sat with Michelle, Dan, and Chris. Chris made a comment and we laughed so hard for like 5 minutes...oh my gosh, I really needed a good laugh!!

Besides that my life is compicated, I have had so much to do that I have been forgetting to do things even though I write them down. It is getting better though and will be better after this play. Tomorrow for our cast party, Sarah is throwing a party at her house so that should be fun. I am pledging for a sorority on campus called Alpha Ocmicron Pi. I have school, and work.

Work, ok so one of the bosses (Tammy) does not like me at all and I knew that just by her attitude around me (I have done nothing to her). So, one day one of my co-workers came in and told me that Tammy has been saying stuff about me and other workers behind our backs! I did not think that she wouldn't be because I knew that she did not like me. But, I told another one of my co-workers and he told another one of our bosses and she told Tammy. So, then they were asking around saying ""So, someone told Katie that Tammy does not like her, do you know who told her?"" At work on Friday, Tammy was sweet as a cucumber to me. She was all nice and I wanted to throw-up because then I knew that she knew that I knew that she was talking about me behind my back. Oh, now work is not going to be so bad!!!

I feel like crying about it but I know that it will not do any good so I should just go lesbian or something, no, I won't do something like that. I don't know.................grrrrrrr. 

I miss my friends and family back home so much more this year and I think it is because of the fact that I do not have any good steady friends here yet. You know, friends who want to hang out with you every weekend and do things all of the time and you know that any minute they are going to call you to hang out. I had it at home and at MacMurray but not here yet. I have friends but they have there friends already that they hang out with all of the time and they do not seem as willing to let me into their group...*sigh* oh, well."

"event","So, How is everyone doing?? I am fine...except for the fact that I am desperatly wanting someone to cuddle with at night. Just someone...anyone...not anyone...but someone who cares about me. 

My previous entry might have sounded that I would never commit to a relationship but I was talking about fads and crushes. I think that if I was in a relationship, I wouldn't get bored and leave. I think that I would be very devoted and would never ever stray because I have seen people do that and I would never even think it. 

I can only say what I would think I would do because I have never been in that situation. I have never ever had a boyfriend before and I think that I am pathetic. I have heard all of my friends, over, and over again telling me that someday it will happen. But, I want it to happen now!!! 

I need to do some homework and go to bed...I cannot think about it anymore.

Oh, Michelle (from Quincy) and I went to Wal-mart earlier and it was fun but all of a sudden when we were shopping...I ran out of energy and I felt that I was going to just fall over. 

I love you all and kisses all around!!"

I decided to go so that I could have a little R&R.

The other day I was on facebook and he added me and I looked at his page and it said that he was single. Then, just two days ago...I looked at it and it said that he was in a relationship!!! Can you believe it :( I am so sad now. He is the love of my life. Yes, yes, I know that he is not Tyrone so that he cannot be the love of my life but oh my gosh each time I look at his picture on facebook...I swoon *heavy sigh*

I think that is how you spell it...and then it was Better Then Ezra. I thought that the lead singer of Rabbit fighters was hooottttt and well all of the lead singers were hot.

Then when the concert was almost over Resa, Sarah and I went to County Market and Resa bought us some alcohol...then we went to Resa's and drank and played drinking games. 

Then some girl named Katie came in and said that this other girl was really drunk and that she was going to let her hamsters go outside in the grass and the Katie chick knew that she would regret it when she was sober and tried to take them from her for the night and she only got 2 of them. The girl left with no hamsters but later a girl found one in her room and I had to pick it up because no one else was willing to touch it. Then they called an RA because they wanted to open up the drunk girls room to make sure that the hamster's cage was closed. 

After that fun stuff I went walking campus and found Dom and Val and hung out with them and some really hot guys who were really horny. And so it was really funny becuase they were drunk off of their asses and were kissing our hands and stuff. It was fun. Then Dom got really sick and almost threw up and then she was trying to throw up to make herself feel better but she couldn't. Then we went out again and just talked to people. It was a lot of fun...I went to bed at like 6 am. I am tried as fuck. But, everyone else...I hope you have a great day!!"

"event","Okay, so update on me...I am back at school...well, not back because it is a new school but, you know. So, last weekend I went to my old school and visited. 

On Friday, I went to Mac and visited with friends and then we got ready and went to the local club, Bogarts(which my legs hurt tremendously from dancing all night). After that, a fight broke out outside and the cops came trying to mase anyone who looked to be in or around the fight. We left and were invited to a party. Abby and I went to this guys house where there were very few people  but there was this one guy who wanted to watch porn and Abby and I said that we didn't care because we weren't watching TV anyways. Then, in the middle of a sex scene he looks at us and asked, ""are you watching it? Do you like it?"" waiting for us to answer and he was acting really weird. So, finally one guy came in and said that we were leaving to go to a different party. So, we left and went to the basketball house. There were a lot of girls and a lot of Freshman so Abby and I left. We got back to Jane and Adam and Jacob and some other guys were outside talking and so I talked to them for quite a while and finally went to bed around 5. 

On Saturday, I went to the alumni soccer game and the Mac players won!!!!! And then I just hung out with people all day then watched movies and then went to bed. On Sunday, I came back to Quincy and did some homework...so ya!!

I have to go do some more homework....ttyl"

"event","So, Michelle, Brenna, Daphne, and I went out last night...so...ya...at first we met at Michelle's house and then we went to the ATM...we were making the observation that the drive-thru ATM has a braille keypad and I asked ""why would blind people drive."" So, I was given kudos for that one, then we went to the SUB and played pool and arcade games! Then, we decided to go to Taco Bell instead of Shari's Resturant. Then, I said that it would be a good idea to maybe eat in a parking lot so that we wouldn't have to wake up Michelle's parents...so, Michelle turns into Veterans park to eat. No more than 3 seconds later do we notice a sercurity car with a very bright light coming...when gets near us we notice that it is a cop car...it stops behind us...then the cop comes to the window and asks if we are doing drugs...then takes our licenses...then compliments Daphne on her picture...then we wait...finally he comes back and is on the other side of the car and gives us our licenses back and he tells us that we shouldn't be there after dark and that drug users are always out ...(i have to go...i will finish later)"

"event","So...on Friday I went to my rhythm class and then my friend Julie and I went salsa dancing at the Boise Cafe downtown...it was really fun but I was paranoid that I would see Rachel H. there. But, I did see Lexi Evans...she came up and talked to me, which is weird because she was all preppy in High School and she never usually talked to me. It was nice though except when she danced with her boyfriend right next to us and (she sucks at salsa dancing) she basically flaunts her love right infront of me...hmmm...anyway, I had a good time. 

On Saturday, my mom and I went shopping and I got a lot of college stuff and I am so excited that Michelle is going to drive with me to college!!! It is going to be so much fun!! Then, I had a rhythm performance at the Canyon County Fair which was a lot of fun.

Today, I had a Body Shoppe party scheduled and I invited a few people to come. Well, we will just say that no one showed up...makes me feel really loved, I will tell you what. But, my Body Shoppe lady and I did facials and played with makeup and then she left. Then, I went to my mom's house and hung out for awhile and now I am bored....I really need to do something....oh well.

Last night I went to dinner at Mongolian BBQ with Michelle and it was really interesting when we opened the door (Michelle at first pushed instead of pulled) there was no one there. It was deserted. So, we started to get our bowls ready hoping that someone would come out soon... then Michelle said that we should sit down and so we did and still no one. Then, FINALLY a boy came out and was surprised that we were there. He said he was so sorry and went to this little cornered off area in the back and was hitting the cook with a pillow to wake him up because he had been sleeping. Michelle and I were trying as hard as we could to muffle our laughs. Then, Brenna called Michelle and Brenna had just finished work so Michelle invites her to come to Mongolian BBQ with us and she does and we have a merry little time talking for awhile and then we talked in my car and then when Michelle and I left, Michelle and I talked in the car some more at my house. 

That was a lot to talk about for such a boring day that I had today. Well...lata."

I have to take care of it and I am really grossed out. I wish she could leave sooner. I have to wait until Tuesday for the dog and her to go away. Oh, and she has a cat, Diva, who doesn't like anyone petting her except for my aunt. 

I heard interesting news about Michelle today from Michelle and I do not know what to think. I am not going to go into detail because I know that she doesn't want a lot of people to know. I am glad that she told me and I accept it. I love her to death and I respect her. 

I am doing laudry right now at my mom's house and I have to fill out all of these stupid financial aid crap on the internet saying that I understand that I am going to be in a lot of debt when I get out of college and I have to pay it all back and blah blah blah.

I am brand spanking new to this live journal thingy. My best friend Michelle wanted me to join and forced me...I think that I am unharmed. So, I am supposed to write a journal entry...like in my journal...I do not write in a journal...hmmmm...predicatments.

Michelle right now is playing the piano...trying to at least. She is playing very randomly. 

Right now I am living at my grandparents house because they are gone for 3 weeks in England and Ireland. It is fun to have the house to myself. 

Michelle and I got drunk last night...first time for me...it was weird. Marni got us the alchohol, which was bitchbeer. 

I do not know what else to say....

"event","Here's the Reapers #1.It's 21 pages, total.If you've been on lj awhile you've already seen this (except it's kinda improved, I cleaned it up with photoshop)-but if you're new and you like the strips I've been posting, you'll love this-it's a whole comic, with finished and inked art,it's not sketchy. Like I said, it's been posted elsewhere, but it should be in my own lj.

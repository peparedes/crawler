"event","So I'm updating?!

Fucking drama pisses me off. I'm not talking about stage acting and all of that good stuff, I'm talking about all of this bullshit rumors and gossip that goes around. High school is over, but it feels like the drama is even more present than it used to be. Sometimes I think that I'm overly paranoid, but when I find out that a supposed close friend has been talking so much shit about me, why shouldn't I worry? I wish people could just be real; say what they really think to everyone. Not something to his or her friends and then the opposite to someone else. Grow up. 

ok, that's all, folks. the end."

Well, I have arrived at my home for the next two terms. 

Mum and Dad dropped me off at Kings Crossing and I made my way to Platform 9 <font size=""-2"">3/4</font> where I had no trouble finding the entrance, unlike a skinny boy with glasses and untidy hair. He was foolish enough to ask a conductor where the platform was! 

I found my seat in one of the compartments on the Hogwarts Express and had just settled down when I was joined by a boy with a toad. He told me his name was Neivelle and he seemed extremly nervous for someone who was already use to living in this magical world. After a nice witch came by with a trolly of snacks, Neivelle noticed he had lost his toad. Knowing he would need help, I at once set out to look in other compartments. 

When I reached the last one, who should I find but the skinny boy with glasses and another boy with red hair and a rather long nose. The boy with red hair was about to do a spell and I wanted to stay and see how he did. Seemed that his spell to turn his rat yellow wasn't very good and I told him so. To demonstrate how a spell <i>really</i> works, I took out my wand and pointed at the skinny boy's glasses and used the simple spell ""<i>oculous repairo</i>"" to fix his tapped up glasses.

It was when he looked up at me I noticed a lightening bolt shaped scar on his forehead. This was Harry Potter! I immediatly knew that I needed to introduce myself as he could be useful in my later plans. After telling him who he was (because he obviously didn't seem to care) I told him I was Hermione Granger, a mighty ranger. This didn't seem to impress him as he just exchanged looks with the red headed boy who had yet to introduce himself, so I asked who he was. Ron Weasley.

I have been sorted into Gryffindor house along with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, both of whom have yet to thank me for my help on the train.

It has been a long day and I have class tomorrow. Good-night.

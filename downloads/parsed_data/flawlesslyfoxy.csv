"event","<center>I would like to say I am satisfied with being single, and for the most part I am. I do not need a boyfriend, nor do I want one simply to have one and rid myself of this boredom. What I do want is a best friend. Someone who just wants to do things with me because he thinks I'm fun and a good person. Someone who marvels at the innerworkings of my mind the way I do his. 
I do not want anything complicated like romance or flowers and candy. I just want someone who stand me for longer than a few minutes. That in itself is a feat. 
It is not because I lack suitors that I am single. There are few guys of all different ages who have asked me recently to go to a movie or eat lunch but no one I would take seriously. I know that sounds harsh but it's true. 
I can honestly say I have no interest in anyone in that way. 
I really don't know where this was going but I'm done."

"event","Why is it that people are so disappointing?
Is it because of all we invest in them THINKING we will receive?
Is it because we trust them and can't seem to let ourselves think badly of them in order to REALLY see them? Instead we sit around in this fog assuming that these people will 'always be there' the way they say they will. We take everything they say and just simply TRUST them and on what basis? The basis that they haven't yet disappointed us?
And what makes us return to the troth after being splashed with pig slop?
What is that longing that makes us want to believe that these people won't do this again to us?
Is it the hope that mankind is inherently good? 
Is it the hope for change that we so ignorantly think will happen?

I can't answer this for you or even for myself. 
All I can say is lately I've been burned and burned severely. 

After four years my so called best friend called it quits.
Never really stating why exactly she had changed her mind about our friendship. 
That hurt. More than even I knew it would. 
But I dealt with it and I've moved on. 

One new developement I found was that for the most part generally think I'm shallow and a bit of an airhead when they meet me. That leads me to think that maybe I've been doing something to make them think that. But this seems to be a neverending quest for me. Because no matter how much I try and change little things about myself to try and improve myself people still have the same impression. 
Why?
What about me gives off that air? 
Why is it that people flock to immature people as if they are mature?


Why???????????"

It didn't end badly it just ended. 
Correction, she ended it. 
Yesterday we got online and started 
to myspace each other back and forth. 
Well, she proceeded to tell me that 
we were two different people, hanging out 
was like hanging out with a stranger and 
the only solution she could come up with 
is calling the whole friendship over. 
How can you do that? 
How can someone just give up after 4 years 
of friendship? After she said she was my best
friend. 
She told me that if I needed something she was 
there I could call her but honestly she isn't. 
What about when I need my friend Amanda? 
She isn't there for me. 
She has her reason and that's fine but 
I'm not going to think this is because of me. 
I'm not going to think that this is my fault. 
Because I was the one who wanted to fix this.
I was the one who wanted to be friends.

If you read this and know Amanda (Beth) please 
don't mention it until she does. Thanks."

I realized, albeit slowly, that I don't do anything for me.
I'm always concerned about what other people want from me.
I never want to disappoint or let down the people I love because
I feel that I've always let people down. 
Someone asked me if when I write in my journal I write what I want

And it's the latter. 
I wish I knew what I liked and what I didn't like and I do

Yes, weird and gross for me to state that but it's true.
I think subconciously I've been dealing with the stress in my life but cutting down on my food intake. Ok, I know what you are thinking, how can I be doing this subconciously when I'm concious of the fact that I'm doing it?

"event","So, I've found out I'm one of the most insecure people I know. 
I honestly didn't realize it until tonight. I don't think I'm ugly, stupid, or not worth anything but I just don't think I'm pretty enough, smart enough, worth much etc etc. 
It's the nagging insecurity that tends to follow you around until you've reached your breaking point and just let it take over and at that point you are into the WHOLE inscurity part. 
Yes, I know God loves me, thinks I'm worth everything, and that I'm smart and just the best but for some reason I can't seem to be able to think that way about myself. 
Some people say that it can't be done. 
You can't honestly think that highly of yourself without being arrogant. But I've seen it done and I believe at some level I can do it. 

What is it that I'm insecure about??
Everything.
I don't think I'm pretty enough. 
Everytime I see someone I think is prettier than I am I feel completely down on myself. 
I don't dress up, wear makeup, do anything with myself really because I feel like it's all for nothing. It won't make me feel better about myself and it won't make me look that way I want to so why even bother?? That is at least, my thinking. 

I don't think I'm smart enough.
I failed my GED by twenty points in math. That's all I failed was math and while some people would look at it as a good thing I see it only as a reminder that I will always be 'twenty point too little.' It's really frusterating because I would LOVE to be smart ... or at least have that potential but I don't ... or at least I don't think I do. 

I think I am not good enough. 
I have this horrible feeling that I have NOTHING to offer. 
Nothing to offer anyone really which may be a HUGE reason as to why I am single the way I am. I hate that but it's true. I am not even a highschool graduate and I don't even have a job right now. I know the job thing isn't really my fault but at the same time it makes me feel so less than everyone I meet. I mean honestly people don't want to hear about why they just want to know if. 

I am completely frusterated with everything. 
At this point I hate being me. I hate it. 

I know God loves me and that He thinks I'm the most beautiful creature, I know He thought I was worth something because He died for me. So, why can't I know this too? 
Why can't I feel it...why can't He just take it all ... all my insecurity and anxiety?? 
Am I not letting Him have it?  
Am I finding my identity in those insecurities rather than in Him where I should find myself???

Well, I'm off to find the answers to these questions."

Let me start with I love you, simply because I do. 
I miss you when you're gone and I value your opinion but something's wrong. 
You see you cared so much for me that you've held on too tightly. 
I mean if you think about it I had to take my road test without you knowing about it. You held off things in my life to try and protect me but I fear now that it's only to my detriment. 
I'm scared now, of alot of things. Too many things. 
I say it's common sense but it's fear. 
I know you never meant to but there are some things that happened to you that you can't just erase their effects on you. Believe me I understand. 
I believe you want the best for me and that you are trying your hardest to do that for me but you can't keep me out of things. I know you know that because I've done things, horrible things without you knowing. 
All I want is to grow up. 
I want to be able to be a woman and not be scared of it. 
You haven't ruined me in anyway but I felt like you ought to know because I am miserable being this way around you. 
I want you in my life but not smothering me. 
I don't want to have to run from you and then grow close years later. I want to know you now. Be your friend but you can't coddle me. You cannot! 
I have to be hurt and feel pain in order to learn from it and yes sometimes it will be pain you don't want me to have to go through but I need to.

Why did life seem so meaningless? 
Why did I feel this way? Will I always feel this way? 
I put out my cigarette and open up the book I had been reading just before that.
I can't seem to concentrate on what I'm reading. There's a cool breeze that smells of magnolias and it brings me back to that place, back to <i>you</i>. 
Oh, how I miss you. I wish you were here with me. 
Everything reminds me of you and I just want to run away. 
Run away from all the memories you've left me here with. Here alone. 
You told me you were going to come back, not to worry it was all going to be fine. 
So why does it seem like nothing is fine? 
I miss you so much I can't stand it and now as tears sting my eyes I can't seem to get you off my mind.
I sigh and try to swallow down my tears. 
When are you coming back? When will I see you again? 
I hope and pray that some unseen force is there with you. Protecting you. 
A letter once or twice a month isn't enough! I miss you! 
I find myself sitting up now without realizing it. 
You do that to me. 
Wiping my eyes I get up from my chair, pick up my book and put it away. 
A light breeze comes by and blows the small, crumpled, tear stained letter unto the ground. 
I watch it in disgust and almost in a panic as I scramble to ground to pick up this mangled piece of paper. 
And as I collect it in my hands my eyes fall on the small, typed out words that tore my heart apart.

 There really is no way to articulate everything that I've felt. It wasn't the whole fact that I had to get saved or burn with this fire it was just that I didn't feel alone anymore. That feeling of being abandoned wasn't there. It's an awesome feeling. 
 
 Something was really brought to my attention yesterday at CC's. I went with Bethany and Amanda to meet up with Bethany's brother since he was in from Dallas. Stacy and Maria, Beth's sister and friend were there so we just chilled. Well, there was a joke that Beth and Amanda started about me having called Amanda a bad word. This was brought up because we were trying to convince Maria that Amanda doesn't live with me well things got a bit out of hand and I left with a feeling that when it was all said and done that Maria might not like me all that much. She jumped to Amanda's defense which is good and all but at the same time she had no interest in find out why I had called me that. She was only concerned with one side of the story. 
 I should have stopped the joke but I felt like I would be the stick in the mud. Not to mention the fact that Amanda and Bethany would be pissed off if I did that but I felt like it was a little immature and I knew from the start it was going to get out of hand.

As if all I am to the opposite sex is a piece of meat for them to gnaw on and as I am widdled down there's no salvation for me but to go back to that which is eating me alive. I don't desire anymore but merely do what I am told. I feel nothing as our lips press together, you're hand slides down my back. All I feel is the disdain for what I've become. 
Loose, sinful. 
There's a moment when I know what you want. 
When everything inside of me is screaming to walk away but it's like a drug. 
I need it knowing it's only killing me slowly. 
I miss it when it's gone and crave it. 
Control. Sensuality, sex. 
But when the moments gone I am left with this sickening feeling. 
This feeling of regret and taintedness. 
I'm unclean and I can't escape. 
How can you hide from yourself?"

"event","things have gotten ALOT better!! 
there's nothing really i can complain about now. 
i'm finding that i'm all that i need ... no one else ... i can be alone with myself and i almost like who i am ... but i think i'll always find SOMETHING wrong but i'm getting to the point where i'm ok with even the things i don't like about myself. 

i don't really need a guy even though i get lonely every now and then ... i'm totally confident in NOT having one. i've learned that playing hard to get or just being hard to get ... not throwing yourself is much more interesting to most guys than a girl who just 'love me love me pllllleeeease'. although i don't find myself any more attractive than anyone else ... i know i'm worth more than i've been asking for ... i think alot of girls need to learn that.

"event","ya'll i swear! 
nothing seems be going right. (if you dont' want to hear bitching then please move on to another diary.) 
i think i have sucessfully pissed all my friends off, i've totally become unchristianized because i've started to cuss againn.(at least in my 'christian friends' eyes) mary doesn't even want to hang out with me so i'm utterly alone ... again. damn... 
i'm pretty morose all the time now. i have my happy moments but i can't seem to get cheery. people say God is the way and then they so you need to do it your own way ... but i've tried both and been a bit dissappointed. 
i'm not saying christianity and God doesn't work ... if you are a christian and it works for you then taht's awesome! i'm glad you've found something ... but right now for me i don't know i've just lost interest. and i think ti's because of the people. if you aren't in the 'inner circle' at my church at least you are left behind and i think that's fucked up. what the hell do the slackers get ... nothing.

"event","My friend Adam is going to the airforce next year and I'm going to miss him soooooo much!!! 
I can honestly say that I love him more than alot of people. He's been there for me sooo much and he's such an awesome person that I hate to see him go. 
I'm going to cry SOOOOO much when he leaves! I hate goodbyes. 
I want to spend time with him ... alot of time. 

He's the only person I know who doesn't care if we look like we are dating. He's not so self-involved that he will forfeit our friendship just so that he can look good. I don't know too many people like that. He takes me to movies and buys me dinner and it's just the two of us and I'm sure that people think we are together but he doesn't care and that SOOO awesome!!! 

I LOVE YOU ADAM!!

Work sucked ... Caroline my manager put me on the register all day and I didn't get to make a single cup of coffee. And she was like two inches away from me breathing down my neck ALL day!! It made me soo stressed out ... I was soooo glad to get out of there. I might have another job at Trade Secret. Maybe.

"event","I find lately that I have been wanting a boyfriend. But I look around and find there a lack of guys that I would want to date. Don't get me wrong my guy friends are awesome! They all rock my face off!! But I have been wanting an older guy ... like between 20 to 24...don't ask me why but I am soo attracted to them it's insane. I really have NO interest in guys my age. 

I find myself wanting a guy who has a good job or is in school and just someone stable. Someone christian and reasonable someone with a good sense of humour who wants a girl who can stand up for herself and what she believes in. Someone who will respect me and try his best to make things work. Someone who isn't all THAT selfish. 

I want someone who wants a serious relationship! I mean I'm desperate for something serious not a one night stand ya know! 

I feel stupid admitting all of this because the guys that I described above aren't EVER interested in me!! I only attract losers or really immature guys who havent' dated or had a serious relationship. I'm frusterated I guess ... I don't want to have to teach him how to lead I want him to take the lead ya know. 

I guess I just don't fit in with that kind of guys ideal girl. I look, sound, and I guess act young so ... who knows. 

There really isn't anyone I know now that I am interested in or could be interested in around. So I'm just venting really...

"event","you know how when one part of your life is getting fixed the other part just has to mess up for you to have to deal with some kind of drama? well that's what i'm going through. 

alot of people don't agree with how our youth group is being run so we decided to go talk to our youth pastor who basically blew us off today. she doesn't even want to make an effort to talk to us about this important stuff. she said to call her tomorrow and let her know when a good time for us would be so we want to go tomorrow after 5pm. who knows what's going to happen. 

i quit the drama team ... again  ... because of the way it's being run. i had quit before but they said they needed me and i felt bad so i wanted to help. well i was basically lied to becuase they have all the people they need. so i decided to quit after i did the drama wednesday but now they want us to do it sunday. and i just can't! i hyperventilated after doing it wednesday. so i quit again ... and danielle is pissed at me and there's other stuff i just don't want to talk about. oh well....

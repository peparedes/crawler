"event","Steffan sent me a nudge and after tonights eventsI guess I'll post something. It sucks that everytime a friend of mine comes back from military duty another leaves, its bullshit. Also, it makes me feel bad since I'm terrible about spending time with my friends, but I'm always so fucking busy or preoccupied. Now I stop by to have a drink with Steffan before he leaves for 1-5 years on some crappy military bullshit and instead of the night being about hanging out with him I get made to feel guilty since I won't nail my friend while she's drunk. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to, a lot. But she's a good friend and I care about her so I won't fuck her when her decision making abilities are all janked up. Girls are truly out of their fucking gourds, and yes, I am stupid."

"event","i'm wondering if i should just talk to her about all of this stuff, everything i've been thinking about. i kind of wish she knew about this journal already and read it, that would get the wondering if i should tell her about it out of the way and it would get all those things i want to say out there. i'm betting that she's going to hang out with ryan this weekend and as my penance for my earlier foolishness (which i feel stupid for and don't wish to dwell on too much) i will leave her completely alone if she does. of course i'm sure i'll try and get her to call me when she's home so i know she's okay but it will definitely be hard. hopefully i can handle it, i don't know what i'll do if it ends up being too much for me."

"event","its hard sometimes to maintain the balance between asking the things i need to ask and not rocking the boat. i also find myself not giving advice that i think i normally would because the advice may be tainted by personal feelings. like ryan.... i think he wants more from her than he lets on, i saw the same exact stuff when i was seeing megan, but i can't say it cause i don't want her to think that i'm giving out a biased opinion. i also think she should nip it off because it will most likely cause a problem sooner or later, and i bet on sooner. but i won't, even though i'd say those same things to a friend i'm not interested in. i also can't ask her what she wants from me, which means i can't say i'll give her that. i'd give her anything, i can't imagine a sacrifice she'd want me to make to be with her that i wouldn't do. but as it is i have to sit and bide my time as i have for these last couple years. i want her to know that i am stable and able to support her, i want to let her know i would work both jobs full time if i had to, but i can't. i'm afraid she may step back from me for my aggressiveness. i could make her so happy if she'd just let me but i don't know when or if she will. all that aside, i do love her more than ever before and the pain she has put me through has shown me that its not a fair-weather emotion but a true and deep one. i just wish she'd give me one more chance."

"event","i've been waiting all day with hope when i knew rationally that there was none. now i'm sitting here alone at her place and i find that i do take some small comfort in that. i guess its knowing that i'll get to see her either tonight or when i wake up. she asked me why i don't go out and do something or make plans, i guess she doesn't realize that i've pretty much given up everyone else for her. the weird thing is that i don't regret that one bit. if i'd been told a few years ago that it would be like this i would have scoffed at the notion, at that time i thought my friends were too important to me. since then i have learned that true friends don't care if its been one day or one decade since you've seen them, they're just happy to see you. all my friends are now moving on with their lives and so have i, unfortunately the person i want to be moving on with is more than hesitant in that regards. oh well, i guess i'll just have to see what the future brings and hope for the best."

"event","i don't know what is going to happen between us or if i'm destined to have my heart destroyed, all i know is that i can't lose hope and i have to keep waiting for you to see how much it is that i love you. sometimes its hard though, you hurt me quite a bit at time, like when you tell me not to wait for you and to try and find somebody else. i don't want to find anyone else, who would want to when they've already found the person that they want to be with. when i'm with you all i can do is think of how much i enjoy spending time with you, even when you're mean to me or ignoring me for someone else. you talk about troy all day, yet still when i look at you i feel this overwhelming sensation of love and happiness, because even though you're talking about him you are there with me. lately though i've been hurting more and more, it seems like you're purposefully trying to push me to someone else like you're trying to get rid of me. but i wonder..... how would you feel if i did find someone else? i think it would hurt you very much, i think part of the reason you want to go out and be so independant is because there is no fear of being alone for you, you know that i'll always be there waiting to see you and spend time with you. the sad thing for me is, that even those times when i have met someone who was interested in me i've either not known or not cared because i was thinking about you. so where does that leave me? could i actually become interested in another? maybe, but i know it would all be a lie and that i was just waiting to hear from you the words i wish you'd say. but will you ever say them? can you say them to me? you wanted to be with me again once before and i screwed it up with bad communication, then almost overnight you no longer wanted to be with me and still haven't. but i want you to know, even if i were to find someone else all you'd need to say is that you wanted me back and i would come to you. i can't imagine loving anyone as deeply or truly as i love you. Maybe someday in the future you'll see that I'm good for you and maybe then you'll love me too. Until then all I can do is hope for a better tomorrow because thoughts of today hurt."

"event","its been great lately. i've gotten to spend a lot of time with her and its made me very happy. some days i just seem to realize how much i truly do care for her and how much i want to be a part of her life. but yet even with all this positive, i get the feeling there is a negative, like there is something she's not telling me. i know we're not dating and she isn't obligated to tell me anything, but one of the things i love is how open we can be with each other, how there is always truth and honesty. still, i feel there is something she is hiding, probably cause she thinks it would hurt me. regardless of all that though at least i get to see her and be with her as much as i do. she got a job too and i'm very happy for her, i just wish it wasn't so early in the morning. it seems like i'm not going to be around her so much and that is upsetting and a little worrisome. anyway, i don't know what my point is, i guess just that she has made me really happy lately and that alongside many other things makes me think about her the way i do."

"event","Things have been interesting lately. Her dad died on 9-21-03 and that really shook my world up. I was really fond of him and it hurt me a lot more than she knows to see him pass, but I am glad that I did get to see him in his final days. Work has been going okay at both jobs, but the thing that I have enjoyed the most is that she has been spending a lot of time with me. I kind of want to move in with her at her house but that is a subject that is not easily brought up nor very appropriate considering her not being as in love with me as I am with her. Oh well. The shitty thing right now is that its 7 in the morning, I can't sleep and its because she's still over at Troy's. She said she'd call me when she left and since I ahven't heard from her I'm assuming she hasn't left yet. My mind is telling me that its no big deal, she's probably drunk and passed out on his couch or she's just talking with him and doesn't realize what time it is. But there is also a nagging suspicion that maybe tonight was the night he finally realized what he was missing by refusing her, and gave in. The thought of her cuddling in his arms makes me insanely jealous and it hurts me very deep as well. I don't know the reason for writing all this other than I needed somewhere to vent and also something to do. I'll leave it at that and just hope she calls me very soon..... I'm actually looking forward to going to her house this weekend and helping her clean it up."

"event","so metaphorically speaking it rained today. not a hurricane driven gale but a stiff cold pour. i got up after a few hours sleep and started my day quite well, got april and her dad coffee, sat about for a bit and enjoyed being at her house. then i took off to come home for my phone interview with at&t wireless. phone interview went very well and i now have an in person interview set up for tuesday with a guy she says is pretty cool and nice. went to my room, read for a while and hung out with nate. it was fairly pleasant. then jilian stopped by and chatted with me for a bit before going to hang out with shanna. go back to my room and got my laundry ready so i could smell fabric soft and fresh for work. right before leaving find out that my dad and shanna took off to take my grandmother to the emergency because she had lost all sense of lucidity. struggled with having to go to work and spent my entire work shift wondering if she was okay or not. found out later that she has pneumonia, some sort of infection and maybe some other stuff we'll find out about when her x-rays and blood tests come back. get home and hang around trying to kill time until i hear from april. at about six i tottered off to bed in a vain attempt to get some much needed sleep. (this is where the clouds roll in to their full splendor) at about seven thirty she calls and tells me she's just now leaving troy's, then begins to tell me about her evening. long story short, he kissed her, they held each other, and she fell asleep there. now she's pretty positive that he does like her and i must say i have to agree. so now not only do i not get to see her cause she wants to just sleep but she may go over to his house and the days of my happy time with her seem to be reaching the zero mark again. if something were to happen between them and they started dating each other i'd hope that i was wrong about her feelings for him. i don't think she really would be with him for a long time, eventually she would get bored with his sedantary lifestyle and they would eventually break up, i think her feelings stem more from the fact that he has rejected her advances ths far and she seems to want to prove to herself and him that she is interested. forbidden fruit is always sweetest when you have never tasted of it. i can't remember if i've heard that somewhere or if its a new one of mine, but it seems to fit very much in this case. he has been unattainable for her and i think that is a lot of what the attraction is now. i know she's not really interested in me no matter how much i try to pretend otherwise, and i also know that i really don't have a lot of hope of ever really getting her back. i just wish i could tell her all the things i want to. i wish i could say the words in my heart and express the feeling that overwhelm me when she is near. but to do that i would probably push her away. i think that she could love me again, i just think that she is not allowing herself to and until she is able to let go of that defensiveness then she is going to remain just outside of my grasp. its funny sometimes to me when she complains about troy and how he drives her mad cause he won't let her know what's up, yet she does the same to me. the only difference is that i'm afraid to hear what is up with her feelings towards me cause i think they might break my heart. i've always felt i was strong in the emotion and control departments, i have continuously displayed my willpower to all those around me, yet she lives outside of that reality. for her my defenses are mere shadows that needs only to step through for a moment to break. 

i don't regret any of my time with her even if it turns out she's never going to be with me. i'll always be there for her and i'll always love her. and i'll always be waiting for her to come back to me where i feel she belongs."

"event","What is reality? Really, what is it that defines what is real in each of our own personal universes? Is it what people do, say, know or a combination derived thereof? This is an interesting thought, for most people reality seems to be based on what they know of what people say or do. Now with this seemingly logical progression in mind.... does something truly happen in your reality if you don't know? if the answer is no then does anyone really want to know the truth. movies and other media have pushed this idea onto us that we are better off knowing the bad things than not knowing them, and while i agree, i don't necessarily think that most people do. i think most people are very happy in their little bubbles of ""truth,"" not knowing what's going in with those closest to them. its true that its very hard to know the truth a lot of the time, but through the pain we feel we become stronger, pain is a motivator. without the fear of pain would we try and better ourselves? maybe, i doubt it, most people are so afraid of the emotional hurt that they better themselves so there chance of being spurned by others is lessened. i myself am very much a victim of this. i don't want anyone to think that i like pain but i understand it for myself. i know that i take the pain of the heart because it will allow me to grow stronger and allow me to grow into the man i want to become. so what does reality mean anyway? is it the happiness of the moment, if so then to me reality is pain."

"event","i'm a fool. i want to be with someone who doesn't love me, and i know it. yet still i stick around. why? i ask myself, because when you've found that someone, that person you want to spend all your time with, that person who makes your heart melt..... that person who brings the only true joy you've ever known to your life, you want to hold on. i know i'm holding too tight though, suffocating her. i just want her to give it a chance, give me a chance. one day she may. i've made many mistakes and caused a lot of pain, this is my punishment. karma is circular and fluid and this is my karma on the darker side of the circle. i put it there though, i did things i shouldn't have and said things that were stupid. i just need to realize that my words alone can't sway her, only she can. only she can decide that i'm worth another shot. i know she loves me, i just don't know how much. i know her love isn't as consuming as mine or probably even half of that, but that's my fault. i blew my chance, if i had not said a few things and trusted more in myself then i would be in a very different situation. she had wanted to get back together with me, but i tried to take it slow and make sure i was for real in my feelings cause i didn't want to hurt her, and in doing so ended up hurting her and the rest of our relationship since. sometimes i trick myself, when i'm alone, into thinking that there is something that's not there. it would be nice to be able to just live with that ignorance but every time i almost immediately tell myself the truth. i should give my instincts more credit, if i had i would probably have the woman of my dreams in the same state of mind as me. i never really understood what a ""woman of your dreams"" was, now i do, cause i dream about her all the time. i dream we're hanging out, i dream we're living together, i dream we're making love and i dream most often that we're happy. and i am happy with her. i would rather deal with the uncertainties of our relationship as it is than not have her in my life. the time before when she was gone was an empty and hollow place, and when she came back it was filled. i was full of joy. i guess i'll just have to use my patience and wait to see what happens."

""for now."" that drives little needles into my ribs every time. oh well.... no one really cares about that, hence my having no friends on here. so to all of those people who don't read me i have nothing to say cause you wouldn't hear it or care anyway."

I comfort myself by saying that I am not regressing to previous patterns, but sometimes I wonder if that is true. The woman that I am in love with is at a party with her friends, who hate me, and she had said that maybe we'd hang out tonight afterward. I am starting to doubt the notion and frankly its upsetting. I don't mean to sound like a pining pre-pubescent child, but god damnit I want to see her. The other thing is, I wonder how long she'll want to keep me around. She has this guy that she has been interested in for about two years now, he says he's not interested in her, but I doubt it. Maybe I'm making something out of nothing, maybe because I am the animal that is man I am creating drama for myself. There's a lot of maybes floating around in my head and all I can think to do to stop them is to get a hammer and break them. That would take away the worries but it would also take away all functioning capabilities and probably kill me. Since I'm not suicidal I guess I'll have to quit bitching and just take care of it.

"event","I've found that with it being so close to Christmas and the holiday season being upon us that I feel absolutely no Christmas cheer. Why is this? I don't understand Christmas nowadays. Originally it was a time for families to gather and appreciate each other's company and love. Now its a commercial empire's wet dream. Yet we allow ourselves to feel obligated to the season and get stressed about being unable to fulfill the monetary obligations that now come with said holiday. I don't hate Christmas, far from it, I love this time of year normally. Its brisk and chill outside adding a crispness not to be found any other time during the year. Yet still I find myself feeling more and more apathetic towards the entire situation. Today's point...... don't let societal standards determine what important times in your life mean, let your own conscience decide that."

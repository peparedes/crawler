<b>Outside my window</b> ... it's cloudy.  I don't know what the temperature is, but it's not as cold as yesterday.  Still, after nearly two weeks in North Carolina, the Waterloo weather is chilly to me.  My crocuses are blooming in the yard, but I miss the profusion of flower trees in Elizabeth City.  I'm planning to replace the dead ornamental tree in our yard with a flower apricot, but apparently you're not supposed to do that until the May 2-4.

<b>I am thinking</b> ... about the modern culture feature.  We have pantophobia we don't acknowledge.

<b>I am thankful</b> ... for a loving husband, a smart child, and puppy who is eager to please.

<b>From the kitchen</b>... I made green smoothies this morning for the first time in two weeks -- spinach, banana & strawberry, with a spoonful of almond/hazelnut butter.  Then I bought Lex & I muffins on the way to KDC.
 
<b>I am wearing</b>... my dark skinny jeans, an aqua long-sleeved T-shirt, a dark pink/raspberry cardigan (with the sleeves of both pushed up to my elbows), my usual rings and necklace, and an my worn-out black loafers.  My hair is loose and my make-up is minimal.  

<b>I am creating</b>... Due to cat sabotage, I'm reworking part of my gift for the Trillium Exchange to be delivered this coming Saturday.

<b>I am going</b>... to Septentrian Baronial Investiture this Saturday.

<b>I am reading</b>... <u>The Hobbit</u> to Alexander at bedtime.  He is loving it.  Bilbo and Kili just found what they think is the hidden door
 
<b>I am hoping</b>... I can be a positive influence.
 
<b>I am hearing</b>... my child fussing because I will not let him watch a movie or eat marshmallow peeps at 9:30 in the morning!

<b>Around the house</b>... it's pretty much a mess (yeah, we could all have heart attacks and die from that surprise).  But tomorrow is Tuesday and time for the blitzclean.  Hope spring eternal.  

<b>A few plans for the rest of the week:</b>  Hmmm ... well, Lex is going back to school this afternoon, there's housecleaning and the dog has a vet appointment tomorrow, Lex has a dentist appointment on Thursday.  I need to finish the TE project.  I need to make sure my Arrochar garb is in order for Saturday (and should probably actually make the belt I bought the materials for at Lilies last year).  And I want to get back to my sorely neglected blogs.

"event","Is blogger ... or maybe more generally <i>writer</i> ... let-down a thing?

I'm feeling discombobulated today and I finally think it's a reaction to how on fire I felt yesterday.  Editing text and watermarking photos took longer than I expected, but it was still purposeful.  This morning I found myself checking my stats several times; how arrogant is that?

If any (either?) of my readers are curious as to what I'm going on about, I started a new blog.  Actually, it's my 3rd blog, but each of them only has a couple entries.  Here's yesterday's work:

<b>A piano</b>.  
A real one.  Made of wood.  And a place to put it in my living room.  And the joy of listening to my son start piano lessons in the new year.  He's five.  It's the perfect time.

That's really the end of the list.

We don't have cable, so we haven't watched the news in years, so haven't been following the story in ""real time"" ... of course, I'm not sure very many people were since the first couple days were obscured by Robin Williams's suicide.

"event","One more post for today ...

Today is August 3rd, 2014.
Exactly 100 years ago today, Germany declared war on France.
In response, exactly 100 years ago tomorrow, Britain declared war on Germany.

For us in the former empire, it was the start of World War I


(Austro-Hungary had already declared war on Serbia on July 28th.
Russia had ""mobilized"" to support Serbia on July 29th.
Germany had declared war on Russia on July 30th.
Italy attempted to stay neutral at first, but finally declared war on Germany in May, 1915

At the end of this morning's church service in Southampton, a man stood up, introduced himself and noted that he and his wife have lived in the US for more than 30 years, regularly returning to visit Canada.  One thing he has noticed is that US churches rarely (he actually said ""never"", but I don't think that's completely true) have something that most Canadian churches, especially rural churches and older urban churches, do:  a memorial somewhere in the sanctuary to those who served and fell in ""The Great War"", be it a stone set in the wall, a commemorative stained glass, or simply a book of names.   I'd never thought about that before."

"event","It's important to me that Alexander learn how to swim and I've realized that he progresses better in daily sessions (the kind the city offers in the summer) rather than weekly sessions (the kind the city offers in the winter).  Last year he languished in the same level for three cycles.  That's just frustrating for him and not worth the money for us.

So I enrolled him in swimming lessons three weeks ago at Moses Springer, the outdoor pool closest to us.  Some time ago I had read about chlorine at indoor pools (where it can't dissipate in the air quickly) being an asthma trigger, especially for (but not limited to) those susceptible to it.   Since <lj user=""theagentx""> suffered from asthma as a child/young adult, this is something I worry about.  Unfortunately, the weather over these past two weeks did not co-operate, and at least half the classes, Lex climbed out of the pools after 15 minutes or so (basically half the class period) announcing he was cold and refusing to continue.  Well, that's not really worth the money either.  So for this week, I enrolled him a half session (only 5 classes) at Breihthaupt, which is being held in the exercise pool - a smaller, warmer pool, often used for water therapy for those with handicaps, or older adults with arthritis.  I also took an aquafit class there when I was pregnant and it's where I took Lex for infant swim when he was six months old.

On the upside, he is thoroughly enjoying these lessons; so much so that he threw his shoes (Crocs) in the water on Monday in an attempt not to have to leave!  On the downside, the exercise pool is in a small room, with a lower ceiling than the main pool (probably helpful in keeping the room warm) and unfortunately, the entire room reeks of chlorine.  Monday after dinner, Lex started complaining that his eyes hurt and he developed hives on his left cheek.  At first <lj user=""theagentx""> and I worried that he had had an allergic reaction to something at dinner.  However, nothing in dinner was anything we hadn't had before.  Then again last night, he developed the same symptoms, only worse.  In fact, he voluntarily went to bed early with a cold washcloth over his eyes.  We decided that the chlorine sensitivity was the more likely culprit, and <lj user=""theagentx""> commented on the smell of chlorine that he had on him when he got home.

So I did some Googling (and some pinning), and I have a few ideas for today.  More than one website stressed the importance of taking a thorough shower before getting in a chlorinated pool.  Apparently it's less the chlorine itself that is problematic than the by-products that are formed when chlorine reacts with bio-matter, including sweat, and we all have some degree of sweat on our skin, even we're not ""sweaty"".  After than, some people have found that rubbing coconut oil on the skin before getting in the chlorinated water helps. Finally, there is a product called ""SwimSpray"" that is available for people with just such an issue, but closest place I can buy it is in Burlington, and I don't think I'm up to a 2 1/2 hour round trip just for that.  However, the key ingredient in SwimSpray is Vitamin C, which apparently interferes with the reaction of chlorine on the skin, essentially counteracting it.  Several other websites gave instructions for mixing a Vitamin C solution in a spray bottle, to be used when getting out of the pool, so I'm going to try that.

Most of the websites made some reference to how inexpensive Vitamin C crystals are at Trader Joes.  Well, that's in the States.  We're in Canada.  We don't have Trader Joe's around here, and I didn't think the Vitamin C crystals that I picked up at Healthy Foods & More after I dropped Lex off at VBS this morning were all that cheap ($18 for 250g), but my little boy was miserable last night.  I also bought some oatmeal and orange oil soap to use on him when showering after his lesson.  Hopefully, we can get all the chlorine off of him today and avoid the issue tonight."

Outside my window ... The amazing sun-every-Monday streak was broken last week with rain, and we have rain again today.  Some pretty spectacular rain woke me around quarter to six this morning.  I really love hard rain storms -- I love watching them from inside :)  However, as I put Lex in the car this morning to go to VBS, I realized how much I actually like being outside -- camping even -- on rainy days, or the day immediately following a good rain.  There is something clean and fresh and <i>real</I> in the air.

I am thinking ... I need really need to get back to both my book and my screenplay.

I am thankful ... Rainy days! :)

In the kitchen ... The dishwasher appears not be working again.  I guess it's time to call appliance repair.

I am wearing ... a Dr. Who/Brave mash-up TeeFury shirt.

I am creating ... The appliqued smokkr is done!  Now I need to take a photo for <lj user=""trimguy""> (Fiona said he'd like to see it since I adapted the ""running dog"" pattern from one of his trims).   Next up I think needs to be the Arro-dress.

I am going ... to have to do a lot of bookkeeping this afternoon :(  I was hoping to drive out to Grobe and look at trees, but <lj user=""theagentx""> reminded me of a sales tax return due on Wednesday.

I am wondering ... Honestly?  Still wondering what can really be done about our plastic-intensive culture.  I've been turning it around in my head over the past two weeks and have been really conscious of just <i>how much</I> plastic is used for little things all the time, and some much of single-use.  It's horrible.  I know some of it is necessary (for sanitary reasons, for instance), but I keeping thinking of places were waxed paper, or even just plain paper wrappings would serve just as well.  I have to wonder what the manufacturing cost comparison would be, but really, paper breaks down rather than ending up in the ocean.

I am reading ... Made some progress on <u>The Renegade</u> (the novel about Robert the Bruce).  Poked about a bit in the book about C.S. Lewis that <lj user=""theagentx""> is reading.

I am hoping ... Lex has a good week at VBS.  This is his second this summer.  I'm also hoping swimming lessons this week go better than last.  It's a half session at an indoor warm pool.  I feel a bit bad about swimming indoors in the summer, but the number of times he refused to finish his lesson last week because he was cool, made it not worth the fight..

I am looking forward to ... camping with Monika.

I am learning ... I'm struggling with naalbinding.  I really want to make a pointy topped cap for Lex and a ""stealth baron"" cap for <lj user=""theagentx""> but Oslo stitch is defeating me.  I probably need to spend some quality time with YouTube.  ... after the bookkeeping, of course.

Around the house ... We've decided to replace the worn carpet in the living room with hardwood.  We have some samples; now we have to decide on colour.

I am pondering... Apolgetics.

A favorite quote for today... [I'll come back to this ...]

One of my favorite things ... rainy Mondays honestly <i>don't</I> get me down.  I have no roses for raindrops to rest on (might have to remedy that), but you get the idea.

A few plans for the rest of the week:  VBS & swimming lessons.  Hemming <lj user=""theagentx"">'s pants.  Sorting the craft/sewing supplies.  I'd love to clear out the utility/laundry/storage room and paint the floor, but I'll be honest: I don't think it's going to happen.  Must post the stuff to Kijiji, though!

A peek into my day ... It was funny to see Tammy and Janelle when dropping off our kids at VBS this morning.  I haven't seen either of them ages, and really, that's my fault.

"event","An addendum to my July 2nd post about Viking clothing and <a href=""http://eliskimo.livejournal.com/456951.html"">What I Don't Know</a> ...

I came across an interesting idea this week, which originated with Margrethe Watt (Danish archeologist, I believe), that the Lejre Freya/Odin Miniature portrays a dress in imitation of the Byzantine's empress' dress, with the hanging frontal piece.  She also mentions other ""elite women"" such as saints being depicted with it.  I believe she's referring to the ""loros"" or ceremonial ""toga"" worn by the emperor and empress.   The emperor's version until about the 11th century still had a definite, although stiff, wrap to it, while the empress' often does appear as simply a long rectangle hanging down over the dress.  That said, the Lejre miniature looks so much like the typical the apron or ""forecloth"" (the ""tea towel"" apron, as it has sometimes been disparaged) in Viking-era women's dress and that it is making me wonder ... could the apron/front cloth have been adopted in imitation of Byzantine fashion?  Note that I'm talking here about the front panel suspended from the twin brooches, not the so-called ""apron dress"" (the ""smokkr"", aka hangerock, traggerock, hanging dress, harness dress, or pinafore dress).

To test the plausibility of that I need to answer a number of questions:

1.  What's the dating of the Lejre miniature?
2.  When do the forecloths appear in Scandinavian art?  (Migration era?  Vendal/Merovingian?)
3.  How much contact did the Scandinavians have with Byzantium (directly and/or indirectly) prior to that time?
4.  What was the nature of the contact?  Is it plausible that Norse women would be motivated to copy an element of Byzantine dress?
5.  Could it be that the apron/front cloth was only worn by high status women?
6.  Which archeological finds are pointed to in support of the separate forecloth (Bau's theories, IIRC)?  Any outside of Birka?"

"event","Something I read this morning really hit me hard:

<I>""In It's Complicated:The Social Lives of Networked Teens, [Danah] Boyd first explains how kids see social networking sites. ""Unlike me and the other early adopters who avoided our local community by hanging out in chatrooms and bulletin boards, most teenagers now go online to connect to the people in their community."" Most parents probably realize that their teens are not using Facebook or Twitter or Foursquare to escape social interaction. But Boyd takes it a step further and suggests that adults have left teens with few outlets for other kinds of social interaction.

Our helicopter parenting, compulsion to overschedule our children's lives, and deepest fears about ""stranger danger"" have meant that teens (at least middle- and upper-class ones) do a lot less hanging out than they used to. If they can't go to the mall, they go online.""</I>

Wow.  

We complain about kids having too much screen time, but it's really the fault of the adults in their lives.  Our society is so afraid of everything, both ""immediate"" dangers (like possible assault) and more nebulous fears of failure (necessitating the overscheduling).  It's just unhealthy.  It also ties in directly, I think, with my previous post about children in the SCA.  Free-ranging parenting really is an act of cultural rebellion."

"event","The above is a stereotypical rural American expression of intentionality.  I heard someone say it at Lilies two weeks ago.  I'm thinking of it today because it is <I> really coming down</I> out there!  This is the second big storm in as many days.  Our CrossFit box flooded during yesterday early morning storm.  I hope it doesn't do it again today.  I stopped at Target yesterday morning and they had fans going in part of the store; apparently they had a little flood, too.  Fortunately we did not, neither in the cold room, or around the laundry room drain (the two places I worried about).  But thinking about ""... and the creek don't rise"" part reminded me of a time it did:

When I was at Ozark, I woke up early one Saturday morning because there were voices in the hallway outside my dorm room.  That was unusual because (as I suspect continues to be the case), young adults like to be out late on Friday nights and sleep as long as possible on Saturday mornings.  I threw back the covers and swung my feet out of bed ... splash!  There was a good two inches (at least) of water on the floor!  I had a ground floor room in the dorm at the bottom of the hill our campus was built into.  From the back door of our dorm we looked across the flats of the soccer fields over to a wooded area and little tributary called ""Turkey Creek"".   The rain the day before had caused to rise, overflow its bank, flood the soccer field and my dorm room.  Well, probably a combination of that and water flowing downhill from the parking lot beside Boatman hall - a parking lot with a wooded hill on one end that tended to turn into a shallow, fast-flowing river with any heavy rain.  We called it the ""Wadi al-Boatman"" *Sigh*

The water was already receding outside, but it needed some encouragement inside.  Large brooms and industrial fans were brought it and we all got to work.  Unfortunately, I had been storing my class notes in a banker's box under the shoe shelf in my closet - on the floor.  I had a boyfriend at the time with a third floor room and no roommate.  He kindly strung clotheslines back and forth across his room and hung up all my notes to dry."

"event","For some time I've been thinking that I had inadvertantly dropped some things out of my 'Daybook', so I today I went back to the source checked.  Yeah, I'd dropped a couple.  They are restored.  So, without further ado:

FOR TODAY

Outside my window...  currently it's bright and sunny (yay, my theme!)  BUT it was cloudy and rainy earlier this morning.  In fact, I was awoken around 2am by a torrential downpour.  Eventually it became a thunderstorm, but it wasn't the thunder that first roused me from slumber.  It was just the rain.  It took me a minute to realize why that worried me; then I tore downstairs and out to through the garage back door to haul in the futon I'd left on the back deck to air out.  Ooops.  Returning inside, I heard a most frantic noise.  Loki was at the dining room sliding door.  He must have slipped out when Ben (our houseguest last night) when out back before retiring for the night.   I let him in and then worried about Beo.  I called at back the front and back doors and then at the front a second time.  He came running out from under the neighbor's trailer.  Poor kitty boys.

I am thinking... not terribly cohesively.  I'm kind of feeling blah.  After the nocturnal cat & futon rescue operations, it took me at least 40 minutes to get back to sleep.  However, the thoughts I have are revolving around what to make for supper, what needs to be done for the party on Sunday, about last night's rain, domain names for a blog ...

I am thankful... for a delightful, almost 5-year-old in my house.  Today he went to VBS in the morning, laughed with me about exploding a hot dog in the microwave at lunch, read some BOB books, and worked on bead mosaics for well over an hour while singing made up songs.  Now's he out on the swingset, still singing.  He's really a delight.

In the kitchen... it's mostly clean.  <lj user=""theagentx""> texted me a while ago asking about dinner thoughts.  I'm mulling a ""meatless Monday"" with things I have on hand and won't require shopping.

I am wearing... dark skinny jeans, my Doctor Who/Brave TeeFury shirt, the usual rings, grey cotton socks, silver-tone stud earrings, and my hair is in a single braid.  No make up.

I am creating...  a blog post!  Mwuhahahaha!  

I am going... to have to get moving on the party prep for next Sunday.  Nobody in town has an How to Train Your Dragon plates or napkins.  I'm running with Pinterest ideas!  However, there needs to a pinata and I need to make that.

I am wondering... why one friend has such <i>extensive</i> food allergies and if anything can be done. It makes me sad every time I read her posts.  She is such a cheerful person in person.  I wish I would just make this all disappear for her.

I am reading... still grabbing snatches of <u>The Forest Laird</u> and <u>The Renegade</u> here and there.  This afternoon I was flipping through a couple Michael Smith cookbooks looking for inspiration.  I also still have both <u>Hold On To Your Kids</U> and <u>The Culturally-Saavy Christian</u> on the go.

I am hoping... the kids all have fun on Sunday.

I am looking forward to... Brouhaha on Saturday and Alexander's party on Sunday afternoon.

I am learning ... well, re-learning, how to naalbind.

Around the house... tomorrow is cleaning day.  We finished unloading the trailer on Saturday so we could use it go pick up a new patio table (the old one having sucumbed to the weight of snow falling off the roof last winter).  The house is mostly presentable.  I do need to sit down and sort paper.  The neverending tyranny of little pieces of paper!  Unfortunately, on-line stuff is worse for me.  Out of sight, out of mind ...

I am pondering... how ""pondering"" is different from ""wondering""

A favorite quote for today... <i>""Authenticity is not about perfection. It's not about right and wrong.  It's about the quest.  Finding the spirit of the dish.  The integrity of doing it the way it's always been done with the same things that have always been used.""</i> ~ Michael Smith, <u>Back to Basics</U> 
He's writing about risotto, but it occurred to me the sentiment applies to historical costuming as well.

One of my favorite things...  archery

A few plans for the rest of the week:  Did I mention I'm planning a birthday party?  I also want to make a ""Hiccup"" tunic for Lex for Brouhaha.  Wednesday is bookkeeping at Iain's.  Lex will be at VBS every morning this week.

A peek into my day...  hmmm. I'm not sure what to write here.  Isn't the whole thing a peek into my day?

(add your picture here) -- OK, add to my plans for the week setting up a photo account somewhere.

Not particularly surprisingly, I have ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" stuck in my head and it keeps making me think of my freshman (Grade 9) band teacher, although I can't remember if ever actually played that song in band that year.

The weather is noticeably cooler today.  Summer cool.  It would have been nice for last weekend, when we were camping, medieval-style, at War of the Trillium!  It was nice of the organizers to hire an ice cream truck, but I'm afraid standing in line for an hour to get a cone for my wee boy did me in.  I would have been better off without!  I think I'm going to suggest that if they do that again next year, they get simpler ice cream: stuff that can be purchased and distributed quickly rather than a long menu of things like root beer floats and banana splits that take a lot of time to prepare, and leave everyone behind the person ordering waiting that much longer in the hot, hot sun.  And maybe call the truck for 2 or 3pm, rather than noon.

OK, Alexander & I have an aggressive day of house cleaning planned ... well, at least I do.  He's currently ""tidying"" his room by playing with the wooden tracks he's supposed to be putting away :)"

"event","<i>Once upon a time</i> I had a dream of writing a 12th century costuming book, since, to be honest, there's not really a good one out there.  Then I got caught up in all that I <i>don't</i> know and my two binders of notes are sitting in a Hobbit tote bag in the library awaiting the return of motivation.

<i>In the meantime</i> I've recently become re-interested in Norse women's clothing (thank you, Pinterest!).  Two weeks ago at Calontir's War of the Lilies, Duchess Lethren & I sought out a class that was ostensibly on different styles of Viking-era women's dress. I thought it sounded like something I had been mulling over, namely how the seemingly ubiquitous Scandinavian style would have varied over the Norse world.  Not so much.  We excused ourselves after about 15 minutes because the ""class"" had started with ""no one really knows anything"" and quickly degenerated to ""SCAdians are so much smarter than clothing historians because we experiment"".  It was very disappointing.

The teacher did have a point:  there is very little archaeological textile material to go on.  However, the way I see it, making a best conjecture (not just a guess) about what would have been worn in Scandinavia, and Scandinavian-held lands during the Viking era is a three-legged stool:  One leg is archaeology.  One leg is period art (like the Valkyrie figurines).  One leg is written accounts.   Take away any one leg and you're pretty shaky.  

In some ways, the 12th century aficionado in me is jealous of the Viking age:  The archaeology seems so much better!  Still, I'm acutely aware of what I don't know.  I spent last night re-reading Hilde Thunem's <a href=""http://urd.priv.no/viking/smokkr.html"">article on the Viking Woman's Apron Dress</a> which Kada (in Storrdatha) has pointed out is a really good distillation of a lot of research.  However, even Thunem points out places where she either thinks the source material is unclear, or admits she either may have misunderstood, or simply cannot access original reports because she cannot read German and English is not her first language.  I, on the other hand, am limited because of my inability to read any of the Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, or Icelandic).  Thunem's article is very helpful, but I think for my own benefit I need to lay out the gaps in my knowledge, as far as I know, and attempt to fill them in, seeking out those who <i>can</i> read the languages to help me when I need it.

How many textile fragments are there?
Where are the fragments from (make a chart)
When are the fragments from (make a chart)
Specify the details of the fragments (size, material, colour, seams, loops, pleating, decoration, etc.)

Then, having done that with the archaeological material, as best I can, I need to chart the visual and textual material as well.  Thor Ewing did a nice job of summarizing and narrating some of it, but reading ""Viking Clothing"" leaves me a lot of questions, too. 

Last weekend at Ealdormere's War of the Trillium, I had a conversation with a nice lady named Raven from the Midrealm about some of things.  One thing I came away from that conversation with was the idea that maybe it's OK to be creative, to play a bit fast and loose with the style IF you have a solid idea of what you're playing with first and don't mistake a ""this looks pretty"" reason with ""this is from a grave"" reason."

"event","We're not going to Pennsic this year, so now that Lilies and Trilliums (I refuse to call it ""Trillies"") are over, so's my SCA summer camping.  That's actually a little sad :(

Now it's time for a little post-game analysis.

1.  I have a child.  This year he was four year old.  Don't forget to pack activities.  We own both a Kubb (""Viking skittles"") and a Bocce (Italian lawn bowling) set and I didn't think to pack either of them.  I did pack the Melissa & Doug ring toss game, but didn't think to take it over to <lj user=""mstress_elianor"">'s camp when we visited.  Planning fail.  Also, last year, I brought a craft: some felt cutouts for making animals.  I forgot about that this year, but he didn't.  It was almost the first thing he asked for after we got the tent set up. 

2.  I really must make a wider ""front porch"" for our tent.  We're thinking about getting a new pavillion next year, but regardless, a little more hangout space outside would be nice.

2.b. I'm officially tired of the roman wall tent with it's 3' side walls.  I hate having to stoop over to reach anything anything not in the center of the tent.  I'd say I'm getting old, but frankly, my parents used cabin tents when they were much younger than I am now.  I'm going with they 'they were smart; I've been stubborn' card.

3.  Also tired of the snap together wire shelving.  Short-term solutions aren't meant to be held onto for 10 years!  Time to make one of these:  http://www.nordicart.net/vikingShelving.html ... or something similar.

4.  I really hate water in the bottom of the coolers.  I especially hate coffee cream floating in water at the bottom of the coolor.  Ick.  Must manage that better next year.

5.  I need to replace most of my shifts.  They're worn out.  I guess stuff that's only worn a couple weekends a month, and a couple weeks a year eventually gets worn out, too!

6.  I never get to spend as much time on the archery range as I would like.  Especially at Trilliums.  This year the only time I shot was the Adult/Child shoot with Lex.  I think I heard Larisa say that we came in 5th.  I did shoot in the Rose Tourney at Lilies, but didn't do as well as I would have liked.  I also did the 100 Arrow Shoot again, made it into the tourney, but was eliminated in 4 rounds.  Lex only let me take him to the children's range at Lilies once.  That disappointed me a little.


OK, Lex is asking for some blueberry water (thanks <lj user=""mstress_elianor""> for introducing him to Mio!), so I'm going to go take care of him.  There may be more thoughts later."

<I>""Happy 106th anniversary of the Tunguska event

""It took a really long time to write these few sentences, because the Tunguska event is just so awesome, in both senses of the word, that we kept getting sucked in (although we don't buy the Black Hole theory). Scientists are still not quite sure what it was but the current prevailing theory is that the blast was created by a meteor air burst, much like Chelyabinsk event a little over a year ago. Except Chelyabinsk was amateur hour by way of comparison: Tunguska flattened trees over an 800 square mile area and created noctilucent clouds across Europe and Asia, making the skies glow at night. So next time you wish upon a shooting star, request that it doesn't create havoc on Earth.""</I>

I just love the last line.

"event","Years ago, maybe my freshman year, one of my professors used a quote from the motivational speaker Zig Ziglar that has stuck with me:

<i><b>""Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.""</i></b>

To be honest, I've never read any of Ziglar's books and I never heard him speak in person (he died two years ago), but I often think of that quote.  There have been times when it irked me and times when it was just the reminder I needed that attitude is always a choice.

I was reminded of that quote again today, and was prompted to look Ziglar up.  I discovered another quote that seemed particularly apt to a certain pair/trio of related situations that have been on my mind:

<b><i>""Be grateful for what you have and stop complaining - it bores everybody else, does you no good, and doesn't solve any problems.""</i></b>

And on that note I'm thankful for certain friends who have choose to take the time on a regular basis to post things that they are thankful for on social media.  It's a nice reminder to me to count my blessings as well and not to focus on the broken."

"event","The episode of ""Jake & the Neverland Pirates"" that Lex watched the other day featured a ""the latest sound"" music group, which is mostly a joke for the grandparents, I think.  This afternoon he bounced around the kitchen while I was making his lunch ad-lib singing ""Little Mommy, Little Mommy Girl"" in his best early 60s Elvis/surfer do-wap voice, which amused me greatly.  He has no idea (yet) who Jan & Dean or the Beach Boys were.

In other news, I'm having my annual, beginning of summer, I-hate-my-garb-and-I-nothing-to-wear (wail!) crisis.  I'm sorely tempted to wear a salwar kameez or something else my laurel would consider non-garb to the event tomorrow.  <lj user=""theagentx""> wants some new garb for Lilies which I have promised to make (a couple Bokstens and some brais) so he can go all 14th century with his knight.  I also have a couple dresses to make for Moira.  I've managed to ""fix"" a couple hand-me-downs for Lex, so he'll have garb (he actually outgrows his, so new stuff for him is a  necessity.  Kol has at least 7 perfectly serviceable tunics in the garb closet).  I'm guessing my desires for a cotehardie and an archery dress will have to wait."

As well, the peas and cucumbers are chewed off about two inches above the ground, and a new hole has been dug under the back fence.  I don't know if I can get replacement plants this late in the season.

In better news, today's green smoothie is nice:  collard greens, almond milk, pears and a teaspoon of cinnamon.

"event","I'm bothered by coal this morning.  I know much of what I'm feeling is an emotional reaction, but I also don't think I should discount my bother because of the emotional component.  

I was watching an episode of ""The Guardian"", a legal series which was set in Pittsburg, PA, where the central story was about the main character trying to land a mining company as a client.  Unfortunately, he discovers a large segment of the seam is on fire, underground, under a town where many of the miners live.  One young woman he meets is pregnant, but also has pulmonary cancer, and the decision has to be made to abort the baby in order to start cancer treatments in the hope of saving the mother's life.  

I just got so angry and sad watching it.  I know it's fiction and they writing is designed to pull on my heartstrings.  Still, it reminded me of what I read years ago about the mountaintop removal method of coal extraction.  It reminded me of the controversy about the Coopers allowing fracking (hydrolic fracture mining) on the property they own adjacent to the campground where Pennsic is held (and Pennsic is only 45 minutes north of Pittsburg).  It reminded me of the woman in Florida who is fighting the city over her right to live ""off the grid"" (with solar panels and private water filtration system rather than being hooked into public utilities) because apparently doing so isn't ""up to code"".  It reminded me of those angry about wind turbines going up in the western part of Ontario.  And it reminded me of the article I read yesterday (thanks to a link via <lj user=""philosophymom""> about the movie ""Noah"" (I haven't seen it yet, but apparently one of the evils, among many, that causes The Creator to want to destroy the world is that it's already been destroyed by strip mining).

That last bit is really what caused me sit down and write just now.  Apparently some in conservative circles where upset by the movie because of its ""hippie environmentalist"" messages.  I'm not sure I really understand that.  Yes, the Bible does say that humankind is to have ""dominion"" over the earth (in Genesis), but Jesus also said that two commandments sum up the whole Law & Prophets:  Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and Love your neighbor as yourself.   I'm not sure how causing an environmental problem (such as a pollution-generating coal fire) that is going to hurt other people can be ignored while claiming to adhere Jesus's teaching which include loving - caring for - those around us.  Being good stewards of our environment and natural resources is part and parcel with loving our neighbors.

I, of course, am using a computer and thus electricity to write this.  I hope today's electrons weren't coal generated, but I honestly don't have know way of knowing.  As the blackout 11 years ago demonstrated, the grid is widely connected.  While a large portion of Ontario's power is hydro, not all of it is, I don't know how much power goes back and forth over our borders.  I hate to think that I'm a part, however small, of misery in coal-country."

<b>Outside my window</b> ... it's currently (at 2:27 in the afternoon) partly cloudy with lots and lots cumulus congestus clouds.  I thought there were some cumulonimbus clouds early, but I don't see any at the moment.  Nevertheless, I am expecting a thunderstorm.  We're overdue and it was already 24 degrees Celcius when I took Lex to school at 8:45 this morning.

<b>I am thinking</b> ... about Gotlandic women's clothing of the Viking era ... about making a cotehardie, or four ... about Noah in midrash ... about literacy in the 1st century world ... about re-arranging my vegetable garden ... whether Disney's ""Frozen"" troubles me or not.

<b>I am thankful</b> ... that almost everything is out of the storage locker.

<b>From the kitchen</b>... Lex & I are on our own for dinner tonight, so I'm thinking sushi.
 
<b>I am wearing</b>... jeans, a blue T-shirt with shirring at the neckline, my usual rings and necklace, and gold stud earrings with a tiny chip of green glass in each.  My hair is pulled back in a scrunchie and I'm barefoot.

<b>I am creating</b>... I decided to go back to basics and I'm trying a threaded-in kivrim pattern on my tablet-weaving loom.  I've been having trouble with the pattern.

<b>I am going</b>... to Pikeman's this Saturday.

<b>I am reading</b>... more of <u>The Forest Laird</u> lately.  Jack Whyte likes to give a LOT of backstory.
 
<b>I am hoping</b>... to maintain a good relationship with my son when he grows up.
 
<b>I am hearing</b>... the intro music for the ""Frozen"" DVD playing in endless loop.  I should really go shut it off.  

<b>Around the house</b>... Lex has new playset in the backyard!  It's awesome.  It also took <lj user=""theagentx"">, his dad, and his best friend an entire day to build.  He says Lex better keep playing in it until he's ready to leave for university :)

<b>A few plans for the rest of the week:</b>  Lilies garb (for four of us), archery practice, lots of bookkeeping ... *sigh*

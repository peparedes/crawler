"event","Yeah so at lunch my freinds have this world geography class and they eat the foods from what culture they are studying. So they studied central america, and they invited me to come eat with them because well, im mexican.  So yeah waited for the food to come and first thing was this quesadilla. It was good after the first bite no... Then i had this mexican hot chocalate, tasted like ass, in pats words.  then i had tortilla chips, those are always good. Then we were leaving cause you know the food was sick ass, and i decided to get a fried banana with this jizz all over it. So i got this cup cause god knows where the plates were and put it in the cup. The cup was like 2/3 way to small so i had to hold this nasty ass banana. SO i take a bite... Fuckin thing is sick ass hell. My freind was laughing his ass off cause i threw it up in the cup then ate some of it again.  so i went outside with this banana and people were like what the shit is that.  Then pat dropped flan all over my pants and pissed me off.  Also im sick right now from eating like a 100 coffee beans and feel like puking. So i go meet up with other freinds and like try to sell my coffee beans for money like a real mexicano would do then i acted like a retard and some girl stared at me... haha it was funny. So yeah then i went to pe..and play B BAll!!! GANGSTA!  then to art, and some girl put on a fucking lil jon and the eastside boyz cd and i was laughing my ass off and started doing that chapelle impression, WHAT!?

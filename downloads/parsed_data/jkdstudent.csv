"event","Dear Boss,
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track. That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits. I am down on whores and I shant quit ripping them till I do get buckled. Grand work the last job was. I gave the lady no time to squeal. How can they catch me now. I love my work and want to start again. You will soon hear of me with my funny little games. I saved some of the proper red stuff in a ginger beer bottle over the last job to write with but it went thick like glue and I cant use it. Red ink is fit enough I hope ha. ha. The next job I do I shall clip the ladys ears off and send to the police officers just for jolly wouldn't you. Keep this letter back till I do a bit more work, then give it out straight. My knife's so nice and sharp I want to get to work right away if I get a chance. Good Luck.


Yours truly
Jack the Ripper"

"event","mostly i think a person has to develop an attitude on a daily basis that prepares them for physical artications that they hope never happen.

1. view ones training as getting ready for a fight.....ie. practice a fighting skill not just an art.

2. avoid fights

3. if fights start try to get away

4. give the other person(s) a way out, physicaly, mentaly and emotionaly....let they save face if possible.

5. if a person has done everything in there power to try not and get in a physical confrantation....then....

6. attack! the more dangourous the situation is....the more violent the attack must be. if a persons life is at stake....then life theatening force must be used if one wants to have a good chance of survival.

don't talk, don't waist time, don't mess about.....

leave or attack if at all possible, wait only if absolutely neccessary. waiting is dangouous, very dangourous!

in legal terms force of a appropriate level should only be used,then again....

like the old saying goes

""Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6""  the decision is an individual one.

like the warriors of old and right on into todays modern warriors have made those decisions long before the event(s) occur, so must we. 

if someone jumps out at you, attacks you, un provoked sight unseen you will have probably 1-3 seconds to respond maybe less a response is being demanded,best to have made some basic decisions prior and just let the body take over if that occurs.

sound and echo....bang!"

"event","We've heard liberal and conservative politicians pontificate endlessly about the inherent dangers of violent videogames, how they will warp young minds and desensitize them to things like being shot in the face with a rail gun, which personally I think is a good thing because if I get shot in the face with a rail gun I would like to be as desensitized to it as possible. When my head is exploded I want to be able to sigh with boredom and then sit down and start eating popcorn and watching a DVD or something. Or shoving popcorn into my neck hole or however that works because I'm not really clued in to this whole thing because I'm so desensitized. 

Debates on the positive and negative effects of violent video games aside, I was shocked to learn that video games can actually KILL YOU. Not influence some kid into killing you, they will physically murder you, so claims the mother of an adult child in Louisiana. 

Basically what happened, in case you don't trust anything you read on sites other than Something Awful, is that this woman's adult son played his N64 nonstop and started having seizures until he died, unable to save the princess or get the power up and win the game. Ignoring the fact that a 30-year-old man spent the better part of every day playing games like ""Luigi's Magic Mushroom Hole"" and ""Super Zelda Cavern,"" we get right down to it and see that obviously at least one of these games he was playing literally murdered him. IT MURDERED HIM TO DEATH. This wasn't ""Doom"" and its urge to kill your parents, or ""The Sims"" and its infectious urge to babble incoherently and throw plates of food on your floor, this game manifested somehow and took Baby Huey's life.
I can't even begin to comprehend the motive behind this mess. I think we can rule out Nintendo themselves as being the guilty party because it makes no sense for them to design a game to kill the user. They're losing even more of their market share to the non-murdering Play Station console. I briefly entertained the idea of a rogue game, a single copy of an otherwise non-fatal title that went wrong for some reason and killed the tragic hero of this little article. I ruled this out as well because I don't think murderous video games just happen; they have to be created by an evil genius which means that more than likely there are others out there, waiting to strike."

They call me lyrical...Jesus
I'm only second to...Jesus
I'm only lyrical...Jesus

Now as I'm peeling myself down off of the crucifix
Smiling like Jesus in the den of thieves tempting bitches
Like the serpent tempted Eve
Making it rain for seven days and seven nights
Had several beats and several careers and several fights
My lyrical rites make your spine hottest
My rhymes stand out like a white boy on the Globetrotters
Only child stuck up, selfish
Buy my records and shine my shoes, treat a nigga like Elvis
Ancient, melodic, mystic messiah
Make MC's heads bob like Muhammad Ali's from Parkinson's disease
Flows you get lost in
Louder than Michael Irvin when he's snortin'
Taking a time machien to talk my mommy into giving an abortion
I don't want to hear you wack motherfuckers hating me
Niggas is Australian they're so far beneath me
Ever since Pac dissed me, Jersey tried to front on me
Now I'm so vain/vein you could probably draw blood from me
So why you doubtin?
I'm embezzling more money than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's accountant
And spitting blood like Gene Simmons but that's irrelevant
This industry prays I go away like Arrested Development
Smilin(?) in a tenement
Now they got me on rewind to dig up a piece of my mind
But if y'all dig any deeper you might not like what you find
Pac died and I cried but I'mma represent it
When it comes to dissing my shit make Makaveli sound like Macarena
Jesus Christ superstar immunity
Got you apologizing like Marlon Brando did the whole Jewish community
Hiding like Anne Frank, your mind is stomped like I wrote Mein Kampf
Changing stone rhymes to bread with one wave of my hands
Son of God, defy me better have a whole army
Or make plans to leave America using the maps of Marcus Garvey
Back up off me, nah nigga it ain't all good
My name is offa more blocks than Lexuses is Puerto Rican neighborhoods
Make you shut the fuck up, like wifey when the fight's on
Lyrical Jesus, I got Satan sleeping with the lights on
I have existed before man and will exist after man
I am an everyman yet I am no man therefore I am a God
Sounds odd
But my talent is priceless
So I rise on the wicked and the good
And rain on the righteous and the unrighteous

Jesus
They call me lyrical...Jesus
I'm a spiritual...Jesus
I'm only second to...Jesus

Straigt up, yo Kurt drop some old school shit
Drop an old beat so we can reminsce on something check it

Rappers stepping to me...they wanna get some
But I'm XL so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, keep that gun in your holster
My rhymes is off the wall like my Big Daddy Kane poster
I gets a lot of love the beat searchers hate it man
Come as recycled bullshit but you're leaving as a Chino fan
That's how I know I'm God; nobody believes in me
I make you wait while I stand in handicapped parking legally
Erik Estrada making chips
Handling fists to get rich
I'm going overboard like strong-willed Africans off of ships
Illest lyrics ever invented, said it, meant it
You're hearing more claps than inside a Vietnam V.D. clinic, get it?
Listen inattentive and get no wins
Don't make me get beside myself like identical twins
My cynical friends still quoting my old rhymes, my mind is a gold mine
The shit is bugged like Martin Luther King's phone lines
Closed minds mass phenomenon, starving like Ramadan
If lines was episodes of Star Trek you niggas couldn't Kling-on
Bugged out metaphor
Got east coast bitches saying ""No he didn't""
While down south bitches be like ""Oh no, hell no""
I made a man blind
So he didn't have to witness the wickedness of world gone cold
Falling off on stages like Bob Dole
Trying to keep my balance
Cause good and evil are having a custody battle over my soul
Like Macaulay Culkin's parents
My hair's like lamb's wool, so fuck what your friends say
You don't want to get off on the wrong foot like Kunta Kente
So now it's going down, ta-dow
Niggas better learn how to rhyme
Before they tell the lyrical Jesus he should bow down
Love your enemies, even in the lion's den
Turn them to a pillar of salt, forgive them Father they know not why they sin
Niggas coming sideways, and I've been that in the past
But now I'm half past giving a shit
And at a quarter 'til I'mma bust your fucking ass!"

"event","I used to sit at the right hand of God in light and splendor
Lavishly spreading love that's all I remember
As time passes I catches miracles he taught me
everything except for some old man and breathe the breath of life
I tried, to just accept he's my savior
But jealousy forced me into sacrilegous behavior
Enraged like I was no threat I hated God's laughter
Waiting for the day the apprentice becomes the master
I'm cursed and damned now to be a creature of the night
Unliving yet living off blood, fearer of the light
But I don't give a FUCK right, because I live forever
I see you all come and go and die and burn
and watch the world still turn
Evil entity, time is resenting me
Thousands of years later I must conceal my identity
A vampire *echoes*

Arrraahhaaa-hahahahahaha!!!

New heights, where it's so dark you need candlelights
To expose the black plague my left hand writes
Nights enveloping and developing pictures in your brain
like a darkroom, in every monestary where I spark boom
A cartoon style smile smirk, how's my emotionless killer clown
synapse behaps relax the bastard black balloon
Nocturnal, high off the herbal, crowding back streets and projects
Illest nigga, coolest slang dialects (dialects)
Bite marks are what you feel if you're my victim
Poisons golden seal couldn't heal from your system (from your system)
Nuts bust down the throats of mad crack heads
Fetal four-eye pleas, fuck it cops kill black kids
Sometimes I wish I could stop the death the pain and the sin
but I'm fucked up create the libations that humans contain within (nasty)
After lightning strikes the steeple of your family church
I beg forgiveness from God, but it never works
I know my soul ain't going to heaven when I expire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
I slit your throat and watch you shake if I desire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
Bear witness to the sins of wicked messiah
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire
Who can I speak to God is dead and the whole earth's on fire
Recognize... the immortal ghetto vampire

Running from the sun by day it's become quite obvious
to the people surrounding me I'm the wildest
Untamable blood-luster plus the high school yearbook photos
that I took in eighty-nine, show no sign of a face of mine
Intertwined my mind is a jungle full of cobwebs and tangled vines
and a glass mace even my closest friends are becoming afraid
Of how I, predicting what's happening and events
Prom dates found they're punctured, blood left pleading then lynched
That's just how I fucking express myself
When I consume your blood and leave you dead
sorry it's just to keep my health
Dark forces, police get nauseous from my trail of corpses
No stake through my heart, no holy water, and no priest with crosses
A woman's mind gets clouded by my handsome mannerisms
Listen obsessions bigger than Jackie Gleason's aneurysms
You caught up when my piercing eyes stare right through you
Stronger than the straightest greatest ancient Haitian voodoo
My unholy presence disturbs animals and children
built a sacrifical altar behind an abandoned building
My sense of smell is heightened my sight is razor sharp
Serene that's thorazine when I remove your beating heart
*bump, bu-bump, bu-bump, bu-bump*
And then the blood starts, flowing
Now I got your soul without you even knowing
Lying in a staircase covered in piss, body decomposing
I turn on sirens and I perpetuate gang violence
I'm the devil that got Malcolm X sleeping in silence
Factual I poison anything that's natural
I kill love and I'm hope frozen up just like it's a statue
Vampires walk among us sucking life from our city
Keeping us in constant states of insecurity
The police watch em... they know me ghetto vampire
The government check em... they know me ghetto vampire
Churches and ministries... they know me ghetto vampire
Niggaz slangin that shit... they know me ghetto vampire
Money hungry bitches... they know me ghetto vampire
The whole school system... fucking ghetto vampires
The fucking media... they know me ghetto vampires
Now who's the vampire?"

Album:  Here To Save You All
Song:   Kreep

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

What the hell made you think the sun rose and set in your ass?
Fast I remove you from my itinerary
I tense you worry and exaggerate
becoming jealous at the drop of a dime, wanting to kill all womankind
You are a perfect ten with the perfect tan goddess
Who could sell Evian to a drowning man, honest
Trying to stay sane walking that tight rope
I'm throwing you off the deep end you better pray shit floats
You gave me chills to your mind when Beverly Hills
make cleverly deals, and now you think you Brooke Shields
Hated my foes, now you one of they one a day hoes
Used to search my ass straight for weed I smoked some days before
I'm crazy yo forever goin farther than just screwin em
Making me feel like Joseph and Mary's hoein in Jerusalem
Abusin em is how they wanna be treated they nosy too
Should I just slap em like Scherazade told me to
You just a tease and you play like I'm not in your league
Capturing my mind claiming I'm your biggest fantasy
I'm unattachin, what think you can spies me
If I couldn't hear your words and only judge you by your actions
Your love is sorcery, drowning in emotion poisoning me
unfortunately your memory is haunting me
I'm feeling pains, that I can't even describe
But if I have to bitch you fuckin buried me alive
Your love counterattacks, unrealistic terroristic acts
Like the Oklahoma Federal Building I collapse
I want her back, but I know that I can't force her
Thinkin bout takin my own life like Marlon Brando's daughter

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
I wish I was special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

I'm back in town, stoppin it, makin perogative home
She too far gone, provactive as Sharon Stone
I'm feeling crucified by the very nails I
Made and drove into myself, passed to the next guy
Phones ringin in the middle of the night (Who's that?  Nobody?)
Your whole game is getting mad sloppy
Meanwhile in my hotel lobby my hobby is removing groupies off my body
It's getting cloudy, smoggy, visibility low, foggy
Four and a half years, I screwed up once
But this ain't your first time, don't be a dummy
You got champagne tastes with fuckin beer money
Fearing bummy we had ups and downs but managed
Now the going gets rough, look how you vanished
It proves that life is a comedian like Martin Short
You standin next to me I wanna file a missing child report
To find the girl we'd always planned we'd run away together
Pray together had a child swore we'd stay together
You had your chance shoulda been nice
your game is deader than Vincent Price
Giving up your ass like you Heidi Floess
Fuck your pink cop crossing guard obsession
You're half-dresses looking like a Soul Train scrambable contestant (bitch)
In my arena, should I fight or just leave her
Catch amenesia it's enough to make me catch a seizure
Catch a breather, Chino do you even need her
Should I take the three-eighty assassinate her like Selena?

I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep, I'm a loser
You're so very special, I wish I was special
But I'm a kreep

Yesterday I seen someone who looked just like you
She walked like you do, so I thought it was you
But then she turned around confusing me
Babyface couldn't bring no cool in me
No Love Connection channel five no Chuck Woolery
Us growing old together is what I envision
You dealing with him, but let's not make no haste decision
The mechanism is getting rusty, you won't trust me
You claim when I blow up I'll leave you for some mono toiling busty
I can't believe you placed this cock above me wrong
I know you like a book but I just cannot find what page you're on
Now you put you in the middle, your voice is just a riddle
Say you want me back then change your personality like Cybill
How hard I try, I just cry more
With no reason to live, many to die for
Now as I sit in a smoky bar the night about to end
I'm passing time with strangers but this bottle is my only friend
Across the room I see a couple with no cares at all
Hugged up kissing reminding me of us before our fall
High so full of hope and passion looking at her man
The way you used to look at me when I just held your hand
You gave me vast pain, to live in the fast lane
I caught the last plane, to give you my last name
I'm caught up, my family come first, that's how I'm brought up
This tragedy's worse, than one I coulda thought up
The couple stood up, I'm feeling drugged like I took Mescaline
The couple I've been watching all the time it was her and him..."

"event","When confronted with a difficult problem, you can solve it more easily by reducing it to the question 'How would the Lone Ranger handle this?'

If someone comes into your life and becomes a part of 
you but for some reasons they couldn't stay, don't cry too much...just be glad that your paths crossed and somehow they made you happy even for a while. 

Bottomline : Time will tell. If she's yours she will 
come back... if she doesn't, don't blame her... it just wasn't meant to be. Treasure those happy moments... and thank her for those times... 

There are so many stars in the sky but only some are 
radiant enough to catch your attention.Among those that you chose to ignore is that one star which is willing to continue shining for you, even if your glance remains elsewhere. 

Bottomline : 
Phrase 1 : The present person who you are with for 
the time being may/may not be the one you truly love. 
Phrase 2 : Should a person who knows that they 
can't be with you for the time being and yet still continue to love you whole heartedly for what you are, is the one. Think about it..."

"event","Alright, this is the second time that some stupid ass people that I have no damn clue who they are have tried to start some shti with me. Am I that popular, or is it just a case of mistaken identity both times? I was walking home from getting my job application from Party City, the city of parties, and when I get on my street, this car 3 deep pulls up next to me, and this is the conversation that ensues....

Stupid ass muthafucka: Hey nigga, you want some beef?

Me: *confused* What?

Stupid ass muthafucka: Nigga you heard me, you want some beef?

Me: *thinking that this could be ""beef"" beef, or the food kind* *smile* Naw, im straight

Stupid ass muthafucka: Yo nigga im serious, you want some beef?

Me: *puts back on headphones and continues walking*

Then both of the passengers get out the car and start walking after me while yelling at me talkin about the god damn beef still. I hadn't had a good day yesterday, and today wasn't much better, and at this point I was pissed off beyond belief, I can safley say I havn't been this mad in my life, mabey it was the stresses of the previous day, mabey it was just the fact that these niggas didn't even know me and they were trying to start something with me, but all I know is that I had to use every ounce of energy in my body to control my temper. I decided to stop walking, because I knew that in my current condition with my leg, I couldnt outrun them, and they had a car anyways so it wouldn't matter anyways. I turned around and waited for them to get to me, fully prepared to fight if I had to, in retrospect that probley wasn't the wisest choice I could have made, they could have had a gun or another kind of weapon and it would have been over for me. They finally caught up to me, and there we stood for what seemed like forever, I stood there grinding my teeth together to keep myself in check and from lashing out in anger. There were no words exchanged until the end when they finally walked back to their car

""This nigga ain't even worth it"" 

Mabey they saw the rage in my eyes and knew that if they tried anything, they would have had to kill me to get off of them. Anyways,I felt relieved that this confrontation didn't resort to violence, I was able to control my anger, and that no one, including myself got hurt. Now im baby sitting my little cousin while my mom and cousin are gone to a Luther concert. We just had a discussion about which is better, Fruit Punch or Orange Juice over a meal of Burger King fries and 8 piece chicken tenders,mmmm.....tenders, and its safe to say that I convinced him that FRUIT PUNCH IS THE BETTA DRINK!Oh, and while he was looking the other way, I ran 3 of his tenders and half his fries.....THANKS! Then we watched Rugrats for awhile, then that went off and Spongebob Squarepants came on, and I taught him how to ROC dance and pelvic thrust to the theme song, my legacy will live on. Damn I feel like a kid again, now he is saying ""why"" to everything I say, time to reverse it on him with a ""I know you are but what am I?"" or a ""Im not your friend anymore"" that will silence him."

"event","Human consciousness has 2 fundamental aspects, which we shall discuss as the Small Self and the True Self. 
The small self is the personal identification that the majority of people possess in determining who they are. 
The true self is the lesser known in terms of our human perspective on life, but it actually the source of our being. 
To assist in the understanding of these 3 statements, I will draw on some analogies. 
The small self is the self that is Observed. 

That is, I am Roger 
I am Roger the Human Being 
I am Roger the Son
I am Roger the Martial Artist 
I am Roger the Friend 

On and on the list goes on and on. 
All these labels and qualifications heaped onto the small self to further expand the separation of the 2 Selves. 
The true self is the self that Observes. 

That is, the Self which is always apart from the small self and is the silent witness to all of the above.
These descriptions of the true and small selves can be more easily understood through a simple mental experiment based on some principles of meditation. It does not require any previous meditation experience. 
Sit comfortably, relax and settle in. 
Start with the intention of stilling the Mind 
Inevitably you will experience thoughts come into your mind. 
This is OK. 
Simply maintain the awareness that you are not to engage, expand upon, or be drawn into following through any thought. Once you are able to do this, still the mind again. Watch any thought that arises, but let them subside and drift away&#8230; don&#8217;t be lured out of the task WITNESSING your thoughts. 

Once you have had the experience of your thoughts being witnessed or observed, we can end the experiment and continue the discussion.

And now for the Killer question&#8230; 
Question: If it is possible to observe your thoughts, what is it that does the observing? 
Answer: The True Self. 
How can this be explained further? 
Consider this: Your eyes, which are the means to vision, can never have a vision of themselves. If your eye is to have a vision of itself, it needs to look in a mirror. 

Likewise if consciousness is to become self-aware, it needs a mirror&#8230; such a mirror is your Mind. Be aware that the &#8220;Mind&#8221; does not represent YOU&#8230; the Mind is merely an instrument of Perception. The identity of YOU being a unique aspect of creation holds its roots in the True Self. 

Defining consciousness does not imply self-awareness or the ability to perform mathematics or wonder &#8220;what shall I do today&#8221;?. A dog has consciousness&#8230; a microbe has consciousness&#8230; a tree has consciousness in that they are all able to have a degree of interaction with their environment. There is an awareness of local external conditions. 

But consciousness is easily lured into the false reality that the reflection it sees of itself through the mirror-action of the Mind is the real thing. This is the experience of us all as we live out our everyday life. Even experienced meditators and other adept&#8217;s of the study of consciousness are still bound by some degree to the illusion that the small self is the real thing, but this does not imply that benefit and positive change are unattainable. Obviously, the Mind has proven itself to be enormously valuable in man&#8217;s quest for the search for truth ranging from scientific and philosophical pursuits, our everyday endeavours, ambitions and dreams, and the exploration of consciousness with a view of knowing our true self. 

To live fully and completely in the realms of the True Self, is to have attained a very very advanced state of spiritual attainment. This is known by various terms such as Samadhi, Nirvana, Full Enlightenment, Self-Realisation, Merging, Liberation to name a few&#8230;. But we do not necessarily have to attain such a perfected or elevated state to bring powerful transformation into our lives. (Note: in the states described above, one does not LOSE ones Mind, but rather the Mind, (the instrument of perception) merges with the True or Observing Self so that the illusion of these entities being separate comes to an end). Just as the space inside a jar merges with the space outside the jar when the jar is broken. The breaking of the jar represents the end to the sense which cultivates duality or separation&#8230;( DAMN THAT SHIT WAS HARD TO EXPLAIN!)that is, the illusion that there is a separate small self and true self. 

Keep in mind that when we talk about the analogy of the &#8216;mirroring-action&#8217; of the Mind, this Mind-Mirror is not to be considered bright and shining and as clear and accurate as our bathroom mirror. This is because this ""Mind-Mirror"" has been formed through and by every life experience we&#8217;ve had since the day we were born. As such, there are natural biases and distortions affecting our view of life and ourselves. 

Consider the ""funny-mirrors"" at the local ""fun park"". Through the mirror&#8217;s gross imperfections and distortions, the funny image we see is far from an accurate representation of truth. Such a mirror can also be biased by its color. If the mirror had a red coloring, we will not see an accurate reflection of something green. However, if we were wearing something Red, that would be accurately portrayed. All other colors through the same mirror would be infiltrated with the bias of the mirror&#8217;s coloring. 

When you look at yourself in the bathroom mirror in the morning, you do not say&#8230; &#8220;Hey! Who are you?&#8221;, as if 2 identities exist, but consciousness is much more subtle and there is difficulty in realising that the projected image of self out of the Mind is only a reflection. 

The image we see in the bathroom mirror will not take on a life of its own, but the Mind-Image (small self), IS composed of consciousness, and will therefore take on living attributes as it accumulates identities brought about by participation inlife. 

By possessing the knowledge of the True Self is to possess a lamp. Having such a lamp will illuminate the path before you to bring you guaranteed change into your life. If the path is walked with resolute intent, profound changes can be assured. 


Through Meditation, we aim to dwell in the regions of the True Self. (even briefly gives a tremendous benefit). This gives us the experience we lack through participating in life from the viewpoint of the small self&#8230;. That is, by the continual identification that we are the Reflection that is seen in the mirror of the Mind. 

The small self is where all our emotions, anxieties, dreams of finding fulfilment, hopes and fears all reside. Language and other forms of worldly expression also emanate through the Mind&#8230;. Which begs a question: If language emanates THROUGH the Mind, where is its source? 

All language, all verbal communication originates as a concept. Such concepts are whole and complete, and are instantly understood by the individual. For example, This entire discourse is understood by me without the need for language, but I employ the Mind for the purpose of getting my message across to you. The original concept or idea was sourced from my True self, but I am employing the abilities of the Mind to exchange to you, the concept that LIVES within me. 

You too have had many such experiences along these lines. Have you ever struggled to convey an idea to someone, but kept on getting stuck for words? You knew in your self EXACTLY what was within, but the difficulty was the EXPRESSION of your idea. The original idea or concept came from the true self. It is the small self empowered through the mind, which delivers the idea for external communication. 

All creativity, inventiveness, unconditional love, sense of righteousness, self-fulfilment, fearlessness, all comes forth out of the abode of the True Self. Fear, which is born out of that which is not known, illusion, and the need for survival and protection of the physical body, are all products of the small self. 

The true self is inherently peaceful, confident and always fulfilled. This is your link with the Divine. 

By regularly going to the region of the true self through the basic techniques of meditation, we are able to remove ourselves from all the dramas, anxieties and concerns of the Mind&#8217;s world. Even 5 minutes a day is good as it gives us the experience of true rest. This 'true rest' is obtained at a mental level, for when the mind is a rest, the body can also follow very easily and obtain benefit. 

These analogies of the Mind-Mirror and its inherent biases and distortions, are not meant to de-value or claim that all things viewed through this instrument of perception are unreliable. Analogies are only meant to serve as building blocks or stepping stones for positive progress. 


So now when you meditate, cultivate the awareness of staying in the silent realm of the True Self. This is that part of you that watches ALL THINGS in perfect peace. 

Know also that 

The Mind is the source of emotions. 
The True Self is never affected by the emotions. 
The Mind co-ordinates worldly expression. 
The True Self communicates in wordless silence. 
The Mind is a repository of knowledge. 
The True Self is your source of wisdom. 
The Mind is the source of passion. 
The True Self is your source of Love. 
The Mind perpetually hungers. 
The True Self is self fulfilled. 
The Mind will always struggles as it thinks it is itself that does the meditating. 
The True Self is Always Meditating."

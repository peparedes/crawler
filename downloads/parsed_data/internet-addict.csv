"event","We were recently lucky enough to get tickets to see Adam and Jamie of the Mythbusters in a Q&amp;A session.  Since my son's name is Jamie, we thought it would be fun to dress him up as Mythbuster Jamie.  This included white shirt black beret, and fake mustache.
<lj-cut text=""Jamie meets Jamie..."">

Walking from the parking lot to the auditorium, we started getting our first fan reactions - from staring and pointing to good-natured laughter to cries of ""cool! Nice costume!"".  Son Jamie at first was embarrassed, then started to enjoy it.  This, it turns out, was a good warm-up.

Once the session started, the moderator asked the Mythbusters questions for about 45 minutes, and they showed some footage that the Discovery Channel had decided not to air.  What could possibly not be family-friendly about Adam lighting his farts on fire?  It's not surprising, given that the Discovery Channel had nix'd the use of the word ""fart"".

Then came the audience Q&amp;A.  Son Jamie was reluctant to get in line, but we cajoled him into it eventually.  Questions alternated between the 2 microphones on the left and right sides of the audience, and most of them came from 10-year-old boys, along the lines of ""What is your most [adjective] myth?"".  To be fair, Son Jamie wanted to ask a question like that too, but I had other plans.

About 45 minutes of this later, we were 2nd in line on the left side when Mythbusters Jamie announced ""We'll take one more question from each side.""  That left us as the first people who would not be able to ask our question.  However, much of the audience near us had seen Son Jamie's slow advance towards the mic, and started pointing at him and calling out, ""Let the kid ask his question!"".  At this point, Mythbuster Adam looked directly at us and proclaimed, ""Oh my God, Jamie, there's a kid here who's dressed like you!"".

I stepped up to the mic, and utterly abandoned my previous question.  The timing was too perfect: we were asking the last question, by special dispensation from the guests of honor, just before the closing montage of Mythbusters outtakes.  There was only one way to go.

""I know that, every show, you say, kids don't try this at home.  Can you please say it a little stronger for my son?""

They loved it.

Mythbusters Adam and Jamie then told Son Jamie to come up on stage.  Adam reached out his hand and hauled Son Jamie onto the stage, with some happy pushing from me.  (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_o/2042793432/in/photostream/"">photo from the audience</a>)  After a moment of the two Jamies gazing at each other, Mythbuster Jamie made the ""turn around"" hand gesture, and Son Jamie gazed out at the capacity crowd of 2500 fellow Mythbusters fans.  Son Jamie turned and said something to Adam, who gleefully repeated it to the audience: ""His name is actually Jamie!"".  As a final treat, the Mythbusters invited Jamie to stay on stage and watch the closing montage while sitting in Adam's chair.

When asked about how it felt being on stage, Jamie said, ""weird"" - but in a good way.  :-)

Seems the solution is obvious... add a ""vote"" function to every ATM.  ""Early voting"" was available to me where I live, so, to avoid long lines, make it possible to vote via ATM for that entire time.  I know few people who don't hit an ATM at least once a month.

This morning, I got a phone call at 9am, offering me a 10am opening.

"event","Monday, 8/14: lost my job.  Called my favorite recruiter, and emailed a few contacts.  Favorite recruiter had a hot lead.

Tuesday, 8/15: Thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, previously a professional typesetter, I finish a new, kick-ass resume.

Thursday, 8/17: favorite recruiter told me that the position was gone.  :-(  That night, I post my resume to a job board.

Friday, 8/18: while packing for a plane trip, I get contacted by about 10 recruiters over a 3-hour period.

Weds, 8/23: one of the recruiters lands me an interview with a competitor of my former company.  He'd had another lead at a different company that's doing cool anti-intrusion stuff using virtual systems embedded on a firewall, but that job got filled before we could talk to them.

Thurs, 8/24: a HR person calls me from a company that created a new field of computing a few years back.  Although the company does different stuff than I've ever done before, they still want to talk to me.  The position itself sounds like the favorite aspects of the job I'd been doing.  Of COURSE I'd be interested!

Friday, 8/25: HR person schedules a telephone interview with me.  Cool, that's 2 interviews I have lined up.

Monday morning, 8/28: in-person interview.  I walked out feeling unsure, but cautiously optimistic.

Monday afternoon: phone interview.  The phone interviewer loved me, and the job sounds even better.

Monday evening: feedback from the recruiter for the in-person interview: nope.  They're going with someone else they've already been talking to.

Tuesday night, 8/29: the other company tells me they're bringing me in for an in-person on Friday.  Cautiously wildly optimistic.  This position is different than any title I've had before, but should allow me to leverage a lot of my strengths.  We'll see where this goes.

I know some of you will want to post ""hooray""-type comments, and that's cool, but don't feel obligated.  I don't <u>need</u> encouragement.  I need luck and skill.  This post has been a public service update for anyone who wants to know how I'm doing in my job hunt.

There's still a few leads I was hoping to hear from that I haven't, and may not.  One of them is with a startup in my previous field whose business is an open secret, and sounds like it would be a lot of fun.  However, the company is still small enough that they might not need someone like me right now.  Ah, well.  Still have hopes of being in on the ground floor of a start-up at some point.  Still not king.  ;-)"

Seriously.  One of my cats curled up and made herself at home in my trousers, while they were around my ankles.

The problem is, by doing a good job fighting this stuff, my company also makes money.  If we do a better job than someone else, we make more money than that other company.

Suddenly, there's a conflict.

It's in the common good to keep the Internet clean and safe.  However, whoever does a better job gets paid better.  This can lead to a mindset where ""The Good Guys"" start focusing more on beating each other than on beating ""The Bad Guys"".  There are reasons that Public Safety isn't privatized - competition for the reward would be counter-productive for the victim.  (Modern popular entertainment provides many examples and dramatizations of this.)

So the question is how to overcome this issue.  I'm going to give this some thought and hopefully write more later."

After my first paycheck, I'm going to get good sushi.  Thank you <lj user=""bdot""> for forever changing the way I eat.

Tomorrow night I'm going to take stock of my first day.  Thank you <lj user=""satyrlovesong""> for changing the way I approach people.

Two more people come to mind.  One of them would probably prefer to remain unmentioned.  The other one doesn't have an LJ.  Both of them have helped me change my life.

There's other people to thank.  I'll do it later.  Champagne and <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/"">Fight Club</a> await."

of the holy water, put some on both legs, and then threw away his crutches.

An alter boy witnessed the scene and then ran into the rectory to tell 
the priest what he'd just seen.

""Son, you've just witnessed a miracle!"" the priest said. ""Tell me where 
is this man now?""

""Flat on his ass over by the holy water.""

Honestly, people, if the corn wouldn't fit in the Foreman grill, how would it fit in the toaster?  So to set the record straight, here's how I did it:

"event","So last night I broke out my mad kitchen skillz while breaking in my George Foreman grill.  Dinner consisted of dry-braised whiskey-marinaded steak, glazed asparagus, and corn on the cob.  This was the first time I'd done actual cooking on the Foreman grill, so I accidentally cooked the steak a bit more than I normally like it.  For the asparagus, I made a glaze of sweet ginger syrup, lime juice, and a bit of tabasco.  That came out wonderfully well.  Corn on the cob doesn't fit on the Foreman grill, but it was perfect in the toaster.

I still have yet to figure out what the big box with the metal spirals on top is for, but small countertop appliances are my friends.  :-)

I don't know if the occasion of getting older is affecting me.  I know that it unhinged my brain lately to realize that my father is 60.  60 seems so... old.  What does that say about me?

Right now my parents are driving around the country in their new motor home.  It sounds like they're having a great time.  I'm terribly jealous.

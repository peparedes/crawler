It has been 3 days since I signed up for Jean Huston&#39;s &quot;Awakening to your Life&#39;s Purpose&quot; 7-week course

I gotta say, I was almost didn&#39;t go through with it because of my financial difficulties of late. The pile of debt I live under and then go and spend more money??? A deeper reason was that I was very apprehensive about spending money on another course and then not follow through; like other times in the past... So I listened to Jean&#39;s voice again, then I read all about the course again and decided that not only do I NEED to do this, I HAVE to follow through like my life depends on it. Because it kind of does...

I&#39;ve been sticking to it as best I can given how crazy busy the last few days have been...

I&#39;ll keep ya posted"

"event","I feel lost and superfluous

When I closed my eyes to go to sleep last night, I saw and heard my boss letting me go by saying I was &quot;dead weight&quot; and the company had no more use for me... I became very anxious and a bit scared. I feel like I've come to an end of sorts. I am trying to deal with feelings of anxiety, loss, defeat, failure as it seems to me that I've squandered all my potential, all the connections and opportunities that have come my way for most of my life. After ten years of living and working in NYC, I don't feel I have ANYTHING to show for it career-wise. NOTHING. I worked at one of the coolest and best studios in the city as a production assistant for a year and a half: I got chewed up and spit out. I pissed away all the connections I made and squandered countless opportunities to meet and network with major industry players. I worked 4 years at a job that sucked the joy of living out of me because I didn't feel I deserved better or because of a shitty attitude, that I wasn't worthy of anything good happening to me. I've been working at a pretty cool job the last 3 and 1/2 years doing something I'm good at but lately I've been feeling very anxious about how much longer it will last because they don't really have much for me to do anymore. I have no idea about what to do when that day comes when I am let go from this company. I am living proof of what happens when you go through life not believing in yourself. I am what happens when you allow fear and laziness to take over. I have failed. So here I am, 38 yrs old and I'm scared shitless! I have no prospects and nothing to fall back on. Yes, I've toyed with the idea of taking my life sooner than later but that won't help, it would only bring pain and suffering to those that care about me. Goes without saying: I NEED HELP! Finding counseling/therapy has been very, very difficult and I've given up the search many times before out of frustration... The one therapist I know and trust is someone is one I cannot afford to meet with... I feel very alone and cannot talk to anyone I know about my fears and anxieties. No one I can think of wants to hear it! They just want me suck it up, smile and say everything's great!"

"event","I lost my father 8 1/2 years ago and still feel very conflicted about my relationship with him. I know he loved me very much and cared a lot about me but he was the quiet, stoic type who would never let on about all the hardship, struggle and sacrifice it took to put food on the table and keep a roof over our heads and everything in between. Father &amp; son talks were few and far between and a bit awkward. He gave me a drink/drugs/sex talk when I was 14 and we never made eye contact as we sat on a park bench. When I was 18 and he dropped me off in college he gave me a letter he'd handwritten - filled with advice and a reminder to write to my little sister often. He took me out to lunch when I started working full-time and told me about not falling into the intransigence of the absolutist who is not open to ideas and solutions simply because they come from someone on the other team. He lectured me when my mom found my stash... Over the years, our relationship was not distant but I wouldn't say it was all that close either - maybe somewhere between cordial and affectionate... Life has only gotten harder and more confusing since then. I'd give anything to find that letter or any of the e-mails of encouragement he sent me when I had a hard time when I went back to college. I'm almost ashamed to say that at 37 years of age, learning to father myself, to believe and trust in myself that I can do anything, is absolutely by far THE hardest thing for me to do. I don't know where that leaves me. I miss him so much and wish I could talk him."

"event","Well... whatever happened to the ongoing food journal? Got L-A-Z-Y !!!

Whatever happened to the whole self-improvement thing? Aside from doing karate (which I very much enjoy), still stubbornly clinging to my comfort zone with its rather unfortunate and all-too convenient source of anti-social instant gratification... FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!

Stuck, stuck, stuck inside of myself with the woe-is-me blues again! Self-esteem and confidence don't seem to come easily for me. Always letting fear, anxiety and pessimism get the best of me. If I believe something about myself that makes me unhappy, I should seek out evidence to the contrary to disprove said belief. I believe I suck with the ladies and do not deserve them so I took myself out of the game so completely, I not only left the field, I went home and holed up in my room. I believe I don't deserve good things because I have not earned them. I can't earn something I'm not willing to commit to - sooner or later, I quit everything that takes effort and consistency - everything! Therapy, Heather's program, self-improvement in general... I'll never punch through to the other side if I don't stick with the things that will help me grow into a better, more mature, masculine man - it's that simple and that difficult.

I seem to know everything I need to do to realize my potential as a man but don't seem to have the will and discipline for it. MLK once said: &quot;you don't have to see the whole staircase... you just have to take the first step&quot;&nbsp; or something to that effect in relation to faith... which I sorely lack in myself as well. Part of the reason, maybe the whole reason of why I always punk out is because of a lack of faith coupled with impatience. Not having faith that if I stick to something it will bear fruit so I tell myself &quot;what's the point?&quot; and give it up. Time passes and I remain stuck. I've been having dreams drenched in anxiety where I can't find a bathroom or privacy to relieve myself, where I'm always being left behind and frantically running to catch up or I'm just left out and overlooked in general... what does it mean?

TO BE CONTINUED... (I don't know what else to say at the moment)"

Tried some pull-ups at the park but maybe I should try them before doing the lap around the park. Did 100 push ups in the grass (4x25). Went to Pregones that evening - saw some good previews of what's to come - had 2 pi&ntilde;a coladas...</em><br /><br /><br /><strong>Sunday 4/19<br /></strong>Breakfast: Bacon, egg and cheese on 7-grain bagel w/Tropicana OJ<br />Lunch: Super smoothie #1<br />Dinner: 3 fried chicken wings w/pork fried rice and a..... coke (gasp!) yes, a coke... meh...<br /><em><br />*Practiced karate in my room for a while. Worked up a sweat and worked on technique a bit. Felt good. Hit the alibi an hour after downing super smoothie - for once I didn't feel totally shit-faced afterwards - the smoothie helped for sure... was a bit in a fuck-it kind of mood, hence the fried food.<br /></em><br /><strong>Monday 4/20</strong><br />Breakfast: 1 corn muffin w/small Tropicana OJ<br />Lunch: 1 slice of Chicken broccoli pizza<br />Dinner: White rice, red beans, 1 lamb chop (oh, so, good!

I strapped on some pads myself and practiced making contact. Sensei says I'm coming along and likes what he sees - I like him, he's cool, laid back, all smiling and supportive<br /><br />**On another note, when I got home from class Ricky starts telling (asking?) me how it would be nice if I cleaned up the area of the kitchen counter where the toaster was...sooner rather than later because it's gross to look at. I got defensive almost immediately because I'd just gotten home and didn't want to deal with it at the moment - I felt ambushed and under siege. He kept nagging and I got really pissed off and yelled that if it bothers them that much they can do it themselves and I'll clean something else - I almost called him out on the fact that he's home all day and couldn't be bothered to do it? but I did not. Nag, nag, nag... I yelled at the top of my lungs to just stop talking already, I'll do it, just shut the fuck up already! Man, I snapped so hard and so quickly that I don't know what the hell happened... what is wrong with me? Deep seated issues? Unmet needs? Frustration/repression? I feel like a goddamn volcano - never know what will set off the next eruption!! I feel like SHIT. Bored, frustrated, irritable, dissatisfied, unfulfilled... man, I just want to go back to sleep and stay there, really... I am bored with this job but now I have benefits and a salary that I cannot afford to go without. Look for another job? Where? Doing what exactly? I know I don't want to work in a studio ever again. What kind of audio work could I possibly do that pays well? To be perfectly honest, the only thing I am enjoying right now is going to karate class, and if the fucking weather clears and warms up a bit, I could also enjoy getting away on the bike. Basically, I do not know what the fuck to do to make some more money - I am so sick and tired of fucking debt bleeding me dry every month - I feel like a fucking slave. I live to work. I live to pay rent and a never-ending parade of fees and bills... ugh... Do I need therapy? Really? Gee, never occurred to me... Therapy is a luxury I cannot afford you dumbass!!! What's the point? All I do is vent and bitch about things but deep down, nothing's changed.

"event","OK, I think my body is trying to tell me something:<br /><br />Sinus infections, aches, etc...<br /><br />So I'm starting a food journal to keep track of my dietary changes as of late. Tomorrow I'm going to check out a Karate school (yeah, that's right!!) because the gym has become boring and uninspiring to me.<br /><br />Rafa gave me some pointers and advice on the kinds of foods that will energize and nourish me. So we started with the smoothies.<br /><br />On Saturday (3/21) I went to GNC and bought this stuff called Spiru-Tein that's filled with a laundry list of proteins and nutrients and so much more (and it's tastes just like vanilla!), as well as flax seed oil for omega fatty acids and another laundry list of similar ingredients. Also went to the grocery store and bought bananas, strawberries, broccoli, apple juice and eggs to complement meals and try out some home-made smoothies.<br /><br /><strong>Saturday 3/21</strong><br />Breakfast: Hard boiled eggs and water<br />Lunch: Greek salad w/black olives, garbanzos, cherry tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, lettuce, feta cheese (that I removed) and dressing<br />Snack: Water crackers with babaganoush<br />DInner: A big chunk of steamed broccoli, oven-cooked chicken thigh and 1/2 cup of white rice (came out really good!)<br /><br /><strong>Sunday 3/22</strong><br />Breakfast: Smoothie test #1: 1 frozen banana, 4 strawberries, 1 cup apple juice, 1 scoop Vanilla flavored Spiru-Tein, 1 tsp Flax seed oil and ice (oh, so good! these are going to rock the warmer it gets!). Followed by a cup of honey-lemon ginseng tea<br />Lunch: Half an Italian sandwich w/ water (forgot all ingredients but pulled out most of the cheese, meh, it was OK)<br />Snack: Half a bag of popcorn and a bottle of water at the movies<br />Dinner: Chips + salsa, One and a half soft-shell fish tacos with some refried beans and rice w/water at Lobo<br /><br /><strong>Monday 3/23</strong><br />Breakfast: 1 strawberry, 1 banana, 2 hard boiled eggs (the 2nd egg was abit much) (chased it w/Arizona Mandarin Orange Green Tea w/ginseng &amp; honey jasmine - helped a lot for my post-nasal phlegm)<br />Snack: Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey crunch bar and half a pretzel<br />Lunch: Chicken Rice platter with salad from Rafiqui's cart around corner from the office (a bit heavy but would not get a chance for another meal until much later in the evening.) Chased it w/peppermint tea.<br /><br /><em>*Going to the Allman Bros. concert tonight. Intend to eat my special cookie for it and will update entry tomorrow...</em><br /><br /><strong>Monday 3/23</strong> (cont.)<br />Early evening: Had 1 pint of Brooklyn Lager at some Irish pub while killing some time. Ate the special cookie and chased it down with a cup of peppermint tea.

An hour later had 1 banana and peppermint tea.<br />Snack:  Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey crunch bar<br />Lunch: Crazy mix from deli: Caesar salad w/croutons, tomato &amp; cucumber chunks, broccoli, carrot, and linguini. Followed by Mandarin Orange tea - didn't sit as badly as yesterday's salad, still it was a stupid mix but I'm experimenting after all.<br />Dinner: baked Chicken thigh (seasoned w/adobo) and steamed broccoli (seasoned w/garlic salt). Followed by an awesome smoothie with same ingredients as last one (see Saturday 3/21)<br /><em><br />* Returned to gym after illness-imposed absence.

"event","Hablando con Arielle el otro dia cai en cuenta de algo muy importante de mi actitud: 

Contandole de porque no tengo muchas relaciones con mi hermano, le conte de una noche en el verano de el '82 cuando nuestros padres estaban de viaje, nuestra abuela estaba cuidandonos. Hubo una noche que 2 amistades de mi hermano estaban visitando. Al igual que a mi hermano, los admiraba y pensaba que eran cool, inteligentes y graciosos y naturlamente queria jangear y ser parte de el grupo... Se estaba haciendo tarde y crei que podia dormir con todos ellos como si fuera un slumber party hasta que uno de ellos dijo: &quot;Si fuera mi hermanito, hace rato lo hubiera metido en el closet.&quot; No recuerdo si se rieron pero era claro que todos estaban de acuerdo que yo era un estorbo y que los debia dejar en paz... Arrastre el colchon (mattress) de la cama a el cuarto de mis padres donde mi abuela estaba durmiendo con mi hermanita. Aunque estaba tratando de hacer lo menos ruido posible, no queria que me oyeran llorando - escuche a mi abuela decirme en la oscuridad que no les haga caso y que se vayan a la mierda (mi abuela hablaba asi). No importaba, estaba bien herido y llore hasta que me encontro el sue&ntilde;o... De ahi en adelante mi hermano empezo a ser mas y mas introvertido, malhumorado, cynico y pesimista - no hablaba mucho pero sus gestos y su vibra lo decian a toda voz: &quot;Dejenme en paz!&quot; Compartiamos un cuarto pero era claro que el lo habia reclamado como su refugio y por lo general yo no estaba bienvenido.. en mi propio cuarto! Asi que de ahi en adelante hize un esfuerzo de estar en ese cuarto lo menos posible y mantener la distancia.

El punto es que aunque nunca se me ha olvidado esa noche, no me habia dado cuenta de cuanto me habia afectado emocionalmente ese rechazo. Supongo que entre ese incidente, todos los rechazos de las mujeres (el maldito &quot;let's just be friends&quot;) y el hoyo negro que era la presencia de mi hermano (recuerdo muy bien su pesimismo, derrotismo y antipatia a todo lo que invadiera su espacio) tienen MUCHO que ver con mis sentimientos de no ser digno, de no merecerme una buena mujer y/o cosas buenas de la vida (felicidad, etc..). De el tampoco aprendi nada de las mujeres ya que nunca tuvo novia, nunca ni siquiera salio con una muchacha, hasta este dia (el ya tiene 41 a&ntilde;os), todavia no lo he visto con una mujer. Encima de eso, recuerdo que habia mucha tension entre mis padres y que mami se la pasaba recordandonos que las cosas estaban malas economicamente; el miedo de la insuficiencia. Tendra mucho que ver con yo carecer de confianza, esperanza, valentia y/o fe. Y a mi hermano lo detesto con indiferencia por tan mal ejemplo y por haberme infectado con tanta energia negativa cuando yo estaba en una edad formativa en la cual lo estaba absorbiendo todo esto como esponja... co&ntilde;o, mano, que carajo se va a esperar? A quien le pudiera sorprender que tenga una mentalidad derrotista que ve un mundo del cual el no es digno, en el que no hay suficientes recursos, y como que no me veo digno, me sacrificare para que otros mas merecedores puedan tener lo suyo...

Todo esto me lleva a la frustrante pero necesaria serie de preguntas de porque nunca he podido superar estas creencias? Porque me he auto-saboteado tantas veces? Porque no he podido cultivar y sostener la voluntad necesaria para perseverar? Porque es que insisto en que no soy digno de la felicidad que todo ser viviente se merece? Porque me castigo tanto? Porque no me atrevo a ser feliz?"

"event","Well, I have once again allowed my dark side to fuck things up...

I just got kicked out of a musical group for my negative vibe - moody, flaky about commitments, stubborn and resistant about critiques - seems my presence created a lot of tension and everyone was at the mercy of whatever mood I happen to be in that day. She says she's no longer comfortable working with me and that that is irreversible... I don't blame her. This is not the first time I've been kicked out of a band by a woman. Seems only guys are willing to put up and overlook my sometimes shitty attitude.

I feel sad but I don't know how to respond or what to make of what I feel. I feel like a failure on a personal level. I feel powerless towards my negativity, it always wins out and gets its way. It's like I can't help myself. It seems I was a total failure in controlling or at least concealing that side of me... Anyone can tell you I'm a great guy and all BUT sooner or later my moodiness will come out of hiding and put off everyone around me.

Is this some subconscious manifestation? Am I holding a grudge against every woman who's ever rejected my feelings? Am I unconsciously projecting this onto women? Is this a way of me protecting myself from getting hurt? Am I punishing all women for all those &quot;let's just be friends&quot; moments of my life? Is this why I no longer have many close female friends? Am I holding that much anger in about the past? Mad at my Dad, my brother and all the women who only wanted to be friends, it seems. My dad for not kicking my ass and making a man out of me, my brother for being such a shitty role model and a prick to live with, and the women... that's my fault, I hate myself for it to this day.

Where do I go from here? I have to be honest, part of me wants to just call it a day and end it all. There's Dr. Paul, the teleseminars and the forums... but I really don't want to bore or burden them with any more of my whining and inaction. Of all the suggestions and advice I've gotten there, I have been an utter failure as I have not followed up on ANY of it with any type of action whatsoever. It's hard, it's tedious. it's scary. Therapy? Sounds like a good idea but that is a luxury. My health plan is not very helpful as far as mental health goes. Last spring, I'd found a great therapist I got along great with but it became too expensive - I shoved my head back in the ground out of sheer frustration. I'm not better. I'm not happier. I'm not at peace. Moody Me is still here, still strong."

"event","Why the fuck do I only write in this journal when I'm in a funk? Why is it that I never feel like writing when I'm in a good mood or good things happen? What is that all about?

With that said, I'm still somewhat rattled by last Friday night. There I was, waiting with the rest of the cast and musicians to get the call to take our places and do our show. One of the backup singers is demonstrating some samba dance moves to one of the actresses sitting next to me. Now samba dancing is very sensual and very, very sexy. The demonstration was making me feel very uncomfortable - I was trying so hard to ignore these magnificent hips shaking in front of me, I did not want to look because I was so afraid of being caught staring. It made me want to go stand on the other side of the room - luckily, just then we got the call to go on...

After the show, I went down to the East Village to meet up with some friends for dinner and drinks. I start telling my roommate and his girlfriend about it because I was still bothered by how it made me feel. And wouldn't you know it? Not 5 minutes after that, she walks in the restaurant because she was going to sing right there! I opened my mouth to mention it to my roommate and his girl and immediately shut my mouth and kept quiet about it. I got all nervous and self-conscious again - eventually I told them that was her. Once they knew, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I waved Hi to her as I walked out the door...

So what the hell was that all about? What happened to me? Why did I get all nervous and panicky like that? Am I lacking that much in confidence and maturity? Is my boundary that weak and porous? I hereby proclaim myself the King Of Wussies. An unremarkable life propelled by mediocrity, half-measures and massive insecurities..."

"event","I think I'm experiencing some general malaise. Been there for many years actually and reading all of Dr. Paul's latest newsletters, the site revamp and all that and I have begun to question my will and desire to do the work on becoming a real MAN.

I've been experiencing a lot of inner resistance to it lately. I keep on reading the forums and newsletters (I even downloaded the teleseminar on getting out of the wasteland last week) but I keep finding myself getting tense, resistant and refusing to take action. The more I read the more frustrated I feel! What is that all about!? It's like a part of me keeps rejecting all the advice and suggestions, it refuses to accept and believe that it can work for me. Perhaps this is the part that keeps me from taking any serious course of action...?

I've been going through this for too long now and even though I am more aware of what I'm lacking (confidence, experience, skill with women), I can't seem to motivate myself enough to take ACTION and persevere. I read all the local publications about the thousands of things to do every week in NYC yet I still keep to my fortified comfort zone. I keep wimping out and asking myself over and over: ""What's It gonna take to snap out of it!? What's it gonna take!?""

You might be thinking that maybe I don't want it bad enough because I may not have experienced anything that shook me to my core, the kind of thing that may force a guy to ""man up"" and step up to the plate (or whatever analogy you prefer). Well, I watched cancer take my Father away from me and my family 8 years ago while I was trying to get through my first year of work in a professional recording studio in the big bad city - the stress and pressure from these 2 combined with a ""Why bother, they only like me as a friend"" attitude about women demolished me...

You would think that something like this would make me appreciate how short and fleeting life is so live it to the fullest right? Wrong! I went in the opposite direction, I figured: ""Well, shit, my dad sacrificed and worked his ass off all his life for what? He was only 57 and didn't get to enjoy any time off"" The lesson I took from that experience is that nothing is guaranteed: no matter how hard you work or how well you take care of yourself it can all be taken from you in an instant so what's the use? what's the point? It didn't make a man out of me, actually, I went into a 5 year developmental arrest that Dr. Paul's work has made me painfully aware of. But I digress...

Obviously there's boundary issues, as my moods tend to fluctuate a lot. I'm usually more content when I have a lot of work as it keeps me busy and distracted (too busy to worry during the day and too tired to worry at night), it's a great excuse to not go out ""on the field"" and push out of my comfort zone... and then to make it even more fun, I start feeling resentful after a while because I don't have any down time!"

How am I gonna help my sister when I can't (or won't?) help myself? Still hooked on bad habits, still not talking to women, still feeling unworthy.... WTF!?

Seems I'm only happy (ok, content) when I have a lot of work, when I'm too busy to sit down and ponder this existential malaise I've been in so long. So Dr. P says to look at a baby picture of mine and see what it conveys, can't do that - got none of those anywhere near me. I find myself questioning whether I even have the will and desire to change. Mission in life? Something I am passionate about? That I would even do for free? To be perfectly honest, years of scraping by to pay the bills, to stay afloat, of getting charged late fees, service cut-offs, payment plans, rent, etc. have hardened me into a mindset where I will not work unless there is guaranteed pay involved. Favors don't pay the bills or the rent, end of story. 

But, deep inside, I feel sad and unfulfilled (and angry about it)- more often than not wondering what the point to all this is? Why would I want children and a family? Isn't the world grossly overpopulated as it is? An endless drain on my time, energy and resources. You want me to donate money for cancer research? The fuck for? Sure, it's a really shitty and painful experience to watch someone you care about deteriorate, wither away and die (I know, because I went through that with my dad) but guess what? That's part of life! You live and you die, it's nature. Is it because you're afraid to suffer? Afraid to die? Maybe this sounds a bit callous, but I'm not giving any of those organizations one cent of my hard-earned money... Mr. Ice right here.

I feel anger and bitterness, can't you tell?

Here I am, 36 yrs. old, never had a girlfriend, no prospects, nada. I go online and visit the personals, check out the profiles of eligible single women in the area, and quite honestly, I always wind up feeling dejected rather than motivated, discouraged instead of encouraged. I read what they're looking for and the qualities they seek in a man, and always end up feeling unworthy and talking at the computer screen: ""Well, I don't have much of anything to offer you then."" I don't make a whole lot of money, I'm not tall, I don't travel much (if at all), not all that comfortable with myself, lacking confidence, etc. you get the picture..."

The past few days have been very demoralizing. I finally got around to filing my taxes and got my ass kicked so hard, I'm still a bit in shock. When I started, I was hoping for a modest refund at the very least to help me pay for therapy, by the time I was done, I found out I actually owe those motherfuckers $1600 all in all! WTF!!! So that's it, my savings have been depleted by at least 50%... it basically means that I can no longer afford EMDR therapy! That sucks more than everything else combined, we were just beginning to make some progress and now I'm forced to shut it all down! FUCK!!!!

I was so bummed out and frustrated yesterday that I hid in the bathroom so no one would see me cry. I worked hard all year and got taxed big time, and now I have NOTHING to show for it! No progress, no nothing. I make enough to pay the bills and get by but not enough to save up. Is this ever going to change? Is this it? Is this as good as it gets? Work your ass off all year and for what? I pay and I pay and I pay and my debts are pretty much where they were a year ago! What's the use!? I see no difference whatsoever...

Am I any better off than a year ago? Is anything better? Has anything improved? I dunno...

"event","So there I was yesterday, showering at the gym after a little cardio workout, memories flying all over the place... ironic, given that part of the reason for my working out is to get out of my head and there I am, TOTALLY in my head...

Anyways, I was thinking about my ambivalence regarding friendships with women and how much that is colored by memories of past friendships. Point being, I feel a low level of resentment towards most of them for perceived wrongs done to me. I think this resentment comes from feeling let down by all of them at some point. Resentment because I was always there for them (often to my own detriment) when they were down and needed a friend. When I was going through hard times they were always unavailable for some reason or another. I felt like the universe was mocking me and making me feel like I'd been used yet again. How stupid of me to assume that just because I'd been there for them, that they would be there for me when I needed a friend? It didn't help either that I fell for most of them at some point and wound up getting hurt and feeling like a complete fool. When my dad died, none of my friends (with 2 exceptions) were there for me. I haven't told anyone but that hurt me as much as losing my father did . With no one left to talk to, I resolved to keep them all at arms' length because everyone's got their own life to live and I cannot count on them to be there when it counts.

It makes me sad to read that last paragraph but it is the truth of how I feel deep down. This surely ties into my feelings of low self-worth and negative self-esteem somehow. I'm going to have to dig deep into these seemingly painful memories to find the roots and origins - to pinpoint a particular event from which these beliefs grow from... and short-circuit them once and for all... get busy livin' or get busy dyin'"

We met and talked a couple of times before the actual EMDR session - he wanted to get an idea of what we should zero in on for EMDR. I wound up reliving 4th grade: new kid in a new school trying to adapt, trying to make friends - being picked on, mocked, taunted, getting into fights, getting my ass kicked. A lot of resentment and self-loathing that grew from that time and I never overcame. He helped me overcome the victim mentality that I'd labeled those memories with. He got me to see that my tantrums and combativeness were really about my jerk-off classmates feeling their hegemony threatened by a newbie and me standing my ground. You could have told me that a thousand times, and I would understand and accept it intellectually but I would still not believe you on an emotional level because I wasn't feeling it. The most interesting thing about this type of treatment as opposed to talk therapy, is that it focuses on the emotional imprint attached to past experiences (micro-traumas) and basically short-circuits them - when he told me those things during EMDR, I FELT it, it hit me and I laughed and cried in relief. My mind felt weird and restless for the next 48hrs as my brain processed what happened.

We are now in the process of figuring out what to zero in for the next EMDR dive... women, dating, rejection anxiety, and low-self esteem are the things that are foremost in my mind. Being comfortable with myself and my sexuality (finding my confidence) are necessary for me to be able to get into and enjoy a relationship with a woman.

He says for now, I should start small and just try to strike up conversations with people (men or women) just to get into the groove and try to build up some momentum...

I'll let you know how that goes..."

"event","Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends...

After a long, frustrating week of cross referencing and searching for an EMDR therapist, I resigned myself to the fact that my insurance provider is basically useless in this area - reimbursement will be minimal. So I went back to the guy I spent an hour on the phone and connected with and set up an appointment for this coming Saturday.

I really don't know what will come out, how I'll respond and how much will it help my situation. Because honestly, I cannot even imagine my life without this elephant sitting on me... or I just don't dare. I feel stuck, sad, afraid... and very frustrated. What if I go through this whole process and wind up regressing and reverting back to the bottom of the well? Then what? All that time and money spent, for what?

Sure, it would be nice to meet a girl to hang out with, but if I don't feel like I have anything to offer, what's the point? Sooner or later my lack of masculinity will surface and that'll be that. I keep logging on that personals website I've had a profile up on for the last 3 and 1/2 years and I always wind up feeling discouraged and demoralized, feeling I have nothing to offer or entice any of the women in there. They all want someone ambitious but laid-back, confident, with goals, sure of himself and his place in the world... every time I read these words, I hear myself answering them: ""Nope, can't help you there, sorry, don't got that either..."" I'm a good listener and like to give foot and shoulder rubs, that's pretty much all I got...

I think I'll stop for now..."

This past Saturday I talked on the phone with a potential EMDR therapist to help me out with my messed up, cynical, pessimistic self-limiting beliefs and my low self-esteem. It was an interesting conversation and he got a lot out of me within an hour.... basically, the extreme shyness I've always had is coupled with a fear of approaching, of rejection and even worse, being accepted and having to step up - this fear feeds my low self-esteem. I also have a very pessimistic outlook on life where I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop: no matter what happens, I'm screwed.

Well, shit man - I honestly think he was right on the money. He got that out of me and now I'm walking around feeling totally bummed because my insurance will only pay for a very small fraction of his fee - thereby making it unaffordable to me. I was really looking forward to meeting him and get the ball rolling on in-depth EMDR therapy sessions. Goddammit, now I gotta start over and find one who IS in network...

I have this belief that every time something good happens, there's always something bad waiting right around the corner to neutralize it, so what's the point? why bother? Work your ass off and sacrifice all your life to be rewarded with a brain tumor, win the lottery and get hit by a car etc... A girl finally digs you and turns out to be a wacko...

I feel depressed, discouraged, frustrated, angry, sour, bitter, depleted, pessimistic, cynical... like I want to just fuckin' give up and crawl under a rock... Well, what did you expect? I have very thin skin"

Alrighty then, I didn't get to go check out the band I was interested in checking out because I wound up in the South Bronx meeting with a couple of friends I'll be mixing/mastering a couple of projects for. I wound up getting home at 2:45am! Thanks a lot MTA! Unable to sleep until 3:30am and got up at 7:30am to go back to work (where I am) - the point being that although I'm quite tired and fried, I'm really glad I got all this stuff to keep my mind occupied and not bumming about ""striking out"" with this woman...

Reading back the last 2 posts, I can clearly see that due to my lack of boundaries, the situation was really getting to me, I was suffering over things beyond my control courtesy of an external locus of control and letting others' feelings about me determine my own self-worth... I have to remind myself that insecurity does not help in creating attraction, at all.

So for the time being, I'll be focusing on work, the mixing project, and my upcoming birthday party!

After talking to my roommate last night about what should I do next about the woman I've met and interested in, things seem a bit clearer... a big reason I didn't get a definite yes or no was because I didn't step up, meaning I didn't offer a clear plan, I didn't take charge, I was not confident... He told me if you're gonna call up a woman you're interested in going out with, have a plan and take the lead - offer a 'package deal' - don't be calling all shy and insecure ""You wanna maybe hang out sometime next week?"" - oh, since you put it that way, I think I'm gonna be busy washing my hair and alphabetizing my groceries...

So I called her today during my much break to tell her I'm going to go check out a band on Monday night and would she like to join me. She told that was the chosen night for the 'girls' night out' she'd mentioned the last time we talked. So now I was all ""ah.. eh.. um... how about Tuesday?"" and she says ""let me get back to you""... So I kept it short, wished her a nice weekend and left it at that...

So, on the one hand I feel I was a bit more confident than on the previous phone call but I still feel stupid because I still can't tell if she's interested or not. I still can't tell if she's just not 100% sure or just not interested, playing hard to get, or testing me (consciously or unconsciously) or what... the uncertainty makes me anxious. I hate this feeling because I feel I was being ME and when it doesn't quite generate interest I feel like being a nice guy just ain't good enough... Let's be honest, I'm not the most intuitive when it comes to women and dating - actually quite ignorant really - so I really don't know what she thinks of me. Maybe if I did, I could figure out how to proceed... goddammit!!!

Yes, I got some major boundary holes in this area"

"event","So there's this woman who 'winked' at me through my online personals profile... I checked her profile out and liked what I saw/read so I emailed her. We exchanged a few messages back and forth, friendly and a bit flirty banter ensued. She invited me to her artist's reception at a restaurant in Park Slope. We didn't get to talk much as she was hosting and socializing, but I got a cool, unpretentious, down-to-earth vibe from her. 

OK, the thing is, it was a huge leap out of my comfort zone for me to go there all by myself, I never do that kind of thing and in fact, I almost chickened out as I approached the restaurant... Being there, I fought hard to maintain a cool and composed exterior while internally trying to keep my anxiety and insecurity at bay and under the radar, yes, I was a bit nervous. I left after a while because I started to feel awkward as the reception wound down and I couldn't tell if she was interested or not - she seemed just as friendly with everybody else... I emailed her the following day and wrote her an awesome email about a minor epiphany I had with one of her collages. She wrote back that she really liked how I out into words what she couldn't and that she was going to Jamaica for 10 days with a girlfriend of hers - she said she'd get back to me when she returned so as to get together for a drink. A couple of weeks went by and I didn't hear back from her - deep down I wondered if she was interested at all based on whatever brief impression she must have gotten from me at her reception. 

A week ago, I bumped into her at a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Cafe Tacuba!), I had a feeling she'd be there based on early email exchanges about our mutual musical faves - my roommate Rafa saw her face when she recognized me from behind and says she lit up... she took me completely by surprise. I was with my roommates and she was with her crew, OK, she left to go find her crew and me and my roommates went our own way. When the show ended and I was leaving I look to my right and there I saw her, we wound up exiting side by side but there was a lot commotion and confusion so we didn't really talk much... I was still a bit taken aback and unprepared for this unexpected chance meeting... 

I emailed her the next day saying what a pleasant surprise it was to see her and that I was still interested in meeting up for a drink and chatting for a while she replied telling me she had a feeling she'd see me there at the show (cool!) and told she would at the Tap Bar Monday night for a show some friends of hers organized and could I make it? Well, I did. 

When I got there I didn't see her right away so I calmly went over to the bar and got myself a beer and watched the band finish up the tune they were playing, and then I spotted her. She was on the other side of the room hanging out with a guy, I quickly wondered if that was her date or something and hung back where she couldn't see me. I actually moved to the back of the room, completely out of sight for a minute and almost put my beer down bolted out of there, because suddenly I felt very foolish for having come all the way here, for what? To watch her flirt with some other guy, please, I'm not THAT masochistic. So I took a deep breath and decided to look again and see if I could suss out the situation - now I could tell it seemed platonic and the guy seemed like he was gay so I breathed a sigh of relief and made my way over and said Hi. She gave me a quick hug and a peck on the cheek (nice!). So, I got to hang out with her a bit more and chat and have a couple of beers - I bought her a round and then she got me one. I got a good vibe and she reminded me a lot of a friend of mine in PR who also happens to be an artist - I now know she's a free-spirited, free-wheeling single gal living it day by day - that she works straight through the weekends managing at a restaurant (that I've been to!). I was smiling and laughing lot and just being generally good humored and easy going but still I felt a bit anxious and unsatisfied: I didn't do courage. I did not step up and straight up ask her out and lay it on the line so as to find out whether she'd go out on a date with me or sees me as a pal or buddy... 

I called her up the following day (Tuesday) to tell her I had a good time and glad I went (she said: me too). I stammered awkwardly while I nervously made small talk and chit-chat but I chickened out again from being straight up and saying: ""I like you and I'd like to get to know you better, would you like to go out with me?"" but it was more a nervous adolescent ""Would you wanna hang out sometime next week?"" To which she said she's not sure how next week is looking and let's touch base later on in the week... I'll call her tomorrow and hopefully I'll be more assertive.

But I wonder if I've already blown it by not being take-charge-alpha male or mysterious and generating attraction and curiosity in her... I guess I have to work on not being so afraid of rejection that I hold back what I want to say or do what I feel..."

The commuting to and from has really been getting to me lately. Starting the day off on  a crowded subway platform, only to be greeted by an over-crowded train is a thoroughly shitty way to start the day - and it is bringing out the worst in me - it is usually a miserable, stressful ride. When I have to go uptown after work to do sessions, it's even worse... another crowded platform to wait for a packed train everyone else is getting on to then make one of the worst train transfers in Manhattan, plowing through a long hallway with a flood of people going the opposite way to get to another overcrowded train... ugh... sometimes I wonder how it is that rush hour does not devolve into an all-out free-for-all...

I watched ""28 Weeks Later"" over the weekend and made me wonder how quickly this city would tear itself to shreds if something like that were to happen in NYC... really, why am I even thinking about this? Oh right, the commute that puts my nerves through a cheese grater on a daily basis...

I feel emotionally exhausted and I feel like all I have strength for is to just slosh on... 

What the hell is my life all about? Where am I going? What do I want? Who do I want?

I just don't know, really. All I know is that I long for someone to cuddle and sleep with, someone to hold who will me back, that's it. Someone I can be myself around and will accept me... not asking for much here, am I?"

Went and forgot all about this journal thing for a while - and when I did, I just didn't feel like writing anything... ugh, so much for being consistent...

So here I am, back for more. I started by going over my entries chronologically and noticed that it started positive and driven and by the last one I was really down on myself, complaining and dwelling on negativity... this is why I always stop journaling: because I always wind up in that negative feedback loop. I can't tell if it helps or harms me to vent my feelings and frustrations. 

I feel like I justify not doing ""the work"" by a negative belief that since the world's going to shit anyway, why bother? I feel like I'm just biding my time until the shit comes down (natural disaster, terrorist attack, etc.). So why bother trying to become a mature, masculine man? Why work on myself to become attractive to women, to find a girlfriend, a relationship, marriage, family? What's the point?

See what I mean? Maybe it's just me using the world situation and current events to justify staying in my little cocoon of comfort...

All that stuff that I wanted to get handled: patience, persistence, discipline, courage, confidence, self-esteem, self-worth, believing in myself - not feeling them...

A slice of swiss cheese has better structural integrity than my boundaries. Here's the latest example: An attractive woman 'winks' at me on an online dating site I'm on, I write after checking out her profile and liking what I see, we exchange a few messages and then I blow it! The last message I sent her seems to have scared her off or something. I invited her to my band's gig, said I'm interested in meeting and gave her my e-mail address... that was Sunday and it is now Friday and not a word - I know she's been on the site as recently as Yesterday so I know she's read the message. I can only assume that I may have come off over eager or something... Point being that I'm bummed about it and feel stupid about it because I have HOLES in my boundary about this shit...

Geez, there I go again... I'm so damn hard on myself! I tell myself 1,000 times that I am worthy and still I don't buy it, don't feel it. I say to myself: ""I AM WORTHY"" and immediately doubt interjects: ""Oh really? You haven't been doing any of the stuff you've been reading!"" I tell myself: ""I HAVE A LOT TO OFFER"" and immediately doubt jumps in: ""Like What?"" and I go blank... I tell ya, this back and forth is exhausting and even depressing at times.

What am I gonna do? Pack it in? Lay down on the subway tracks?

So I did go to the Brooklyn Museum but, I didn't approach anyone, I didn't talk to anyone. It was pretty crowded and by the time I got there I was kinda tired (excuses! excuses!). I'd gone to the gym a couple of hours earlier and worked my legs pretty hard. I walked all the way to the museum and I covered all 3 floors using the stairs - had 1 beer on an empty stomach... I was so tired already that I didn't feel like doing anything anymore. I walked all the way back home, cooked myself a nice dinner and called it a night.

Once again, saturday night, alone. Friday night? Alone. Instead of mingling more, I find myself withdrawing just as much. Stuck in a loop of sorts. I've been going to the neighborhood dive bar a little more. I bring my ""Count Of Monte Cristo"" book and have a couple of pints while I read some more (it's a huge book and I can't put it down!) - gotta admit, it gets people curious seeing somebody sitting at the bar with such a thick book, absorbed in it and oblivious to everything around him - mystery? does this create mystery? hmm... that's the only damn thing I can even remotely consider mysterious about me at the moment...

Goddammit! I gotta start talking to people!!! What's it gonna take for me to snap out of it!? I have heard that once people confront their mortality, everything else is easier and not so scary - that thing about keeping it present in your head, reminding yourself that today could be your last day on Earth would (or should) embolden you to take risks and chances. Stubborn as I am, in those moments of anxiety/fear of doing something and I hear that voice reminding me that this could be my last day, in my stubborn spite I spit back ""Fine then, bring it and let's be done with it!"" More afraid to live than of dying.... ain't that something?

Well, a lot has happened since my last entry: 

I went to Chicago to Dr. Paul's 7th Sense seminar and had a great weekend. I'm glad I did courage and went through with it. I bondedand made friends with a bunch of guys of varying ages from all over the place, we shared meals, stories, experiences - this was something I'd been sorely lacking and yearning for quite some time in my life. I managed to approach a handful of women while out bar hopping thanks to some prodding from one of the coaches. I didn't really get past an opening line with any of them but the point was just to approach them, and I did. You have to understand what a big deal that was for me since this is something that has always caused me lots of anxiety, I NEVER approach or talk to women anywhere! I had Dr. Paul do EMDR on me in front of the whole group (that took a lot fo courage) to try to make a breakthrough on my underlying self-esteem/belief issues I carry with me - it didn't happen. I couldn't pinpoint the root/source of my residual beliefs about myself since childhood - my mind started jumping all over the place but just the mere fact that I had the courage to get up in front of the whole group and open up about deep, personal issues could be considered a breakthrough in itself - I dunno, kind of in the fence about that. He did recommend that I check out a movie called ""The Secret"", he felt that I would benefit from it.

Anyways, I came back feeling pumped up, recharged and optimistic; and then I got sick.

I came down with a mild yet persistent flu immediately upon returning. Over the course of a week, this damned flu sapped me of all energy and momentum.

Now I find myself in a funk once again. I seem to have a lot of anger in me. I've been putting it out there on the online personals for over 2 years now with very feeble results: a handful of awkward 1st dates and a 2-month fling. One of the things I was hoping to get some one-on-one help with at the seminar's workshop was this very thing. I wanted to sit down with someone to dissect my profile, fix it up and get a personalized game plan to take back with me - this didn't happen. We did get a presentation about it and I learned that 90% of what I was doing just doesn't work. Ouch! I've been corresponding over e-mail with this person, I sent him my online profile so he could help me with it - he replied that I was giving WAY too much info about me and no mystery, that he couldn't get a sense for what it is I want in life, and what I'm looking for in a woman; which is true on both counts. No problem he says, that he was very excited about a whole bunch of ideas that he had for my profile, BUT, he charges money for customized profile re-writes. After all the money I spent on the seminar, I gotta keep paying? Am I pissed about this? YES, I AM! But to be brutally honest, I honestly don't know what it IS that I want, I don't know what it is I want in a woman - at least I have not found a way of framing these positively, I only know what I DON'T want... this makes me crazy.

I keep hearing in my head: ""what do you want?"" Over and over again. Once or twice I've almost yelled out ""ENOUGH! SHUT UP ALREADY!!"" in the middle of the street. I've been stuck in this loop and can't seem to be able to break out of it. Am I trying to drive myself insane?

After Dr. Paul's recommendation and a deluge of e-mails suggesting the same, I checked out ""The Secret"" online this past weekend and a few hours later found myself at a ""new age"" store and walked out with 2 scented candles and the soundtrack to the Secret. Now I can listen to it at my own pace, anytime, anywhere. It was very inspiring even though I still have to ""do the work"" to get clear on what it is I want. 

So now I have to decide: Do I want to go ahead with the profile rewrite? Do I want to date around a bit and see how it goes? Should I lay low and work on myself first? Should I do both in parallel? Decisions, decisions...

Stay tuned..."

Had a pretty good weekend: helped out my buddies with construction for our future rehearsal/recording studio, went to a friend's b-day party at a neighborhood bar, chilled out and watched ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with the roommates... as well as some introspection...

This morning I chose to restart my morning ""AH"" meditations for manifesting guided by Dr. Wayne Dyer. I want to re-focus and align myself with the creative energy out in the uuniverse as well as within me.

I realize that the reason I was so bent out of shape last week was because I have unmet, un-communicated needs - unresolved anxieties about my immature/arrested development/liminality issues... Yearning for a mentor in my life, someone I can talk to, confide in, to coach me, to prod me into action (because when left on my own, I don't)... So I have chosen to do the next-best thing: I'm taking a HUGE leap of faith and going to Chicago next weekend to attend Dr. Paul's seminar on developing a seventh sense and set out on the path to become a mature, masculine omega man.

I need this on so many levels. I believe that overcoming my cowardice and lack of confidence in approaching and dealing with women will liberate me on other fronts as well: professionally, I will be able to approach others confidently - I will be able to truly network and make new connections, thereby landing more and better-paying gigs that play to my strenghs and interests... I am doing this seminar on the faith that they will help me break through my barriers to become a bigger, grander version of me and that it will pay off exponentially in the future...

"event","OK, let's get this thing started:

So it's 2007. A new year, a new beginning. Another chance to turn it all around...

So last night I went ballistic once again and lashed out at my roommate. Sheesh... I'm 35 yrs. old and still throw temper tantrums. Seems that when I get stressed out, I'm about as stable as nitroglycerin... that's one of the things I just have to overcome. Need to strengthen my boundaries and not be letting stress get to me like that.

I've been feeling very frustrated lately. But why exactly is that? Work's good and I'm not hurting financially. But on a deeper, personal level I feel unfulfilled, frustrated and anxious. You see, I am total coward on the social/interpersonal arena: I become very anxious when thrown into a small social setting where I don't know anyone, particularly women. I've been trying to get at the source of this fear/anxiety but it eludes me and I can't seem to put my finger on it - at the moment I stop and try to analyze and figure out where the feeling is coming from, it hides somewhere - this is very frustrating.

I'm currently reading Dr. Paul Dobransky's MindOS (look it up) which suggested the idea of keeping a journal as a way of observing ego. It basically means stepping outside of yourself and monitoring yourself, your choices, your thoughts, your feelings - being your own coach and cheerleader.

Wish me luck. Doing the work will not be easy...

'til next time..."

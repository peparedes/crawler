"event","I have a really bad attitude about having young children ""help"" me with chores.&nbsp; I know I should use the opportunity to teach them how to do things.&nbsp; I know I should encourage them to help when they see others working.&nbsp; But it is negative work and I'd rather get housework quickly by myself.&nbsp; I hate, for example, having a four year old take glass glasses out of the dishwasher and hand them to me.&nbsp; It takes longer AND I get to worry about her dropping a glass.<br /><br />After dinner yesterday I told R to get his clothes out of the dryer and put them away.&nbsp; L announces she is going to help.&nbsp; I knew I should really intervene and prevent her from bugging him.&nbsp; However, all I could think of was that maybe I could get the dishwasher loaded without ""help"" before he started complaining about her.<br /><br />I hear them coming up the stairs.&nbsp; R tells L that her job will be to cheer him on - not to help him carry the clean laundry.&nbsp; He is teaching her to cheer lead?&nbsp; Guess I <i>totally deserve </i>that.&nbsp; But then when they reach the upstairs R tells her she is doing it wrong.&nbsp; L had been telling him to ""move it"" in a little girly voice.&nbsp; He models screwing up his face like a drill sergeant ""you have to <i>MOVE IT.&nbsp; NOW!</i>"".&nbsp; L tries her best to screw up her face in imitation ""you have to MOVE IT!"" she repeats.&nbsp; OK her voice was way to high to sound really threatening but she just tried so hard to imitate him and took it so seriously I had trouble not laughing.&nbsp; They go through the kitchen and dining room with R moving slower and slower until he is ordered to ""MOVE IT"" causing him to temporarily move slightly faster with his burden.&nbsp; Being a drill sergeant counts in L's mind as helping?&nbsp; I never would have thought of that.<br /><br />He tried to tell her that he didn't need help putting the clothes in his drawers but she started crying.&nbsp; The crying stopped a few seconds later.&nbsp; So after I was done clearing the table, I went to watch them to see how he did it.&nbsp; She was happily sitting on his captain's bed that had all three drawers completely open.&nbsp; R took each item out of the hamper and right-sided it out.&nbsp; Then he would dangle it in front of his sister and then snatch it away when she reached for it.&nbsp; After two rounds of this he would accidentally-on-purpose allow her to capture the item.&nbsp; She would promptly wad the item up in a ball and drop it in the correct open drawer.<br /><br />Someone has the wrong attitude about accepting ""help"".&nbsp; I think it might be me.<br /><br />I suppose I should be concerned that his clothes will be even more wrinkled than they are with his normal boyish folding job but it was such a rare chance for them to work together on something I just don't care."

"event","I love to be holier than thou about weddings.&nbsp; Let's face it, the wedding industry is a really easy target.&nbsp; Just today one of my favorite co-workers was telling me about his sister-in-law who, if she didn't think her wedding gift was expensive enough, wrote in the thank you note ""is this all?"".&nbsp; For water cooler chatter weddings simply can't be beat.&nbsp; But recently I've decided I really should stop pointing out various anti-wedding industry articles to people.&nbsp; I've done it enough.&nbsp; BUT, I stumbled across <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118057207757919398.html?mod=blogs"">this article in the WSJ</a>.&nbsp; Apparently there are now wedding blogs on personal wedding web sites, called ""wed sites"".&nbsp; One women was quoted with a long list of complaints about dress shopping and center piece making.&nbsp; The quote ended with ""I am usually not in the best mood, so I tell everybody to look at the Web site to see why"".&nbsp; I would drop over in a dead faint if one of my friends/co-workers said that to me.&nbsp; After that I'd get really annoyed.&nbsp; Maybe I shouldn't.&nbsp; After all I don't have to listen to the whining and if I don't go to the web site, I don't even have to read the whining.<br /><br />I have a friend who makes cracks about his wife's blog.&nbsp; At least he isn't the star of a youtube video of his marriage proposal.&nbsp; Please let him make a another remark in front of me soon.&nbsp; When he finds out about wed blogs, he will be speechless."

"event","My daughters' gymnastics lesson takes place in one has of a gymnasium.  Half way through the class today I realized that I could go shoot baskets in the other half and still be available for bathroom assistance (i.e. yanking down leotards under time pressure).  The other half was empty except for a teenager than was shooting around.

I was a high school basketball player but I was BAD.  I wasn't solid enough to knock people over on my way to the basket while making it appear that I wasn't committing a foul and, even if I had been, I wasn't aggressive enough, I was a wimp.  So I played only when we were so far behind or ahead that I couldn't have any effect on the game.

However, the coaches told me over and over that I had a flawless shot technique.  They made up drills to encourage me to pummel other players.  I got pummeled.  They made we work out with a medicine ball a few times.  ""You will never be a good player"", my coach said making an OK sign, ""with arms this big around"".  My arms really hurt.

But I go over there confident that I won't embarrass myself because I'm just going to shoot around and I have great shot technique.  I arced the ball up perfectly and it went straight down just short of the hoop.  Nothing but air.  I did it again.  And again.  And again.  Then R made a shot with the no arc hurdle the ball two handed from his belly technique.  The little wise ass pointed out that he made a shot first before he went back to work on his HW.  I'll have him know, in a real game such a shot would have been blocked.  Then the TEENAGER started giving me advice on how to shoot.  Ouch.  I know how to shoot.  I'm just rusty.  Hey, I graduated from high school and stopped playing before he was born.  I found out later he was 14.  OK, so I graduated from grad school before he was born.

My ego will recover soon.  I did start sinking them after both my son and the teenager wandered off.  Nothing but net.  Honest."

"event","Went to the drive-in last night to see Cars.  This was a great movie for small children BTW.  It had nothing remotely scary in it.  Some Pixar films have elements that really young children are scared of, the mentally deranged kid in Toy Story, for example.

We never went last summer because a friend of a friend of a friend was talking about crimes there.  I suppose it could be true but I felt foolish for worrying about it once I got there.  The theater is now divided into two separate unconnected halves each with it's own restrooms and concession stand.  The R-rated movies are always in the other half now.  We saw all these grandmothers with young children there.  People who I could just tell where probably there every week; they had drive-ins down to a science.  They had their lawn chairs lined up stadium style and the food spread out just so on the tailgate.  The husband of the couple next to us was surfing on his lap top while waiting for the movie to start.

Drive-ins are like Halloween for us - we have an unlimited junk food policy.  We fill the van with junk food and tell the kids live it up, it won't happen again soon.  But we ended up revoking this policy half way through the movie.  Once L realized that she wasn't going to be limited to a single bowl of chips, she ate and ate and ate.  L managed to end up holding the bag and I think she knew we would take them away if she prevented R and T from having any but she managed to look offended whenever one of them reached in.  Finally we cut everyone off.  We were worried that L might throw up or something."

"event","I was expecting a very important call from my pediatrician.  I had to get the infamous green school physical form at the last minute (old daycare closed without warning and new daycare requires it) and my ped's office has signs all over the place stating ""Make you school physical appointments early - lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on our part"".  I had called the nurse's hot line and left my sob story on the machine.  I gave them my cell phone number so I would be sure to be available.

The phone rings while I'm going to the bathroom.  I think, this is not a problem, there is no reason to be uptight about this, I just won't flush until after I finish talking to them.  So I stand up to dig my phone out of my pocket, flip open my phone and say hello.  But my hello is drowned out by an extremely loud ""WHOOSH"" because I FORGOT FOR A SECOND THAT THERE ARE AUTOMATIC TOILETS WHERE I WORK AND I HAVE JUST STOOD UP LIKE SOME KIND OF MORON.  For a heartbeat I think for fuck's sake cover the receiver and run but a beat later I realize how far could I really get with my pants around my thighs and a stall door to unlock?

The nurse hesitates a second and says ""are you free to talk right now?""

""Yes!"" I reply with alacrity.  She didn't sound like she believed me."

"event","So R and I have gotten into movie nights lately.  It is a good sister-free activity for us to do together.  It is actually pretty difficult to find movies that we both would enjoy, that neither of us have seen and that are appropriate for a 9 year old.  I did see Galaxy Quest and Ferris Bueller's Day Off over again so he could enjoy them.  There were perfect 9 year old boy moments in both those movies.  In GQ a galactic pig creature gets beamed up but something goes wrong and it reconfigures inside out and then explodes.  In FBDO the parking garage workers joy ride in the Ferrari to the Star Wars theme.

The past two weekends we watched the same movie.  Well actually we didn't.   R, 9, and I watched the last two Jurassic Park movies.  (I let him see an edited version of JP I two years ago; he had been begging to see it for 2-3 YEARS prior.)  R has loved dinosaurs since he was tiny.  I actually liked both movies.  Sure, they both followed the same formula:  escape from T-Rex, meet up with velociraptors, escape, run into T-Rex again, velociraptors, T-Rex, velociraptors, leave exhausted and bleeding on a helicopter, the end.  But it is a really fun formula as long as you don't have any heart or blood pressure problems.  JP II had some great one liners.

Gushing Female scientist:  ""I just can't believe how much fun this is - studying real dinosaurs!""
Nerdy math guy from JP I:  ""Sure it is fun for a while, until the screaming starts.""

The directors were careful not to have too much gore; both had less gore than I remember the first movie having.  Basically the camera pans away as someone [either an unlikeable person or an unimportant red-shirt-wearing person] starts to get eaten.  Not something I would want R to see on a big screen but on a TV it was fine.

And R is now old enough to make sarcastic comments about the script with me - one of the advantages of seeing a film at home instead of in a theater.  In JP II, the scientists get the great idea to take a baby T-Rex back to their lab to repair its broken leg.  My readers will never believe this but mommy and daddy T-Rex misunderstood this gesture, a development even a 9 year old could predict.  If someone that stupid gets eaten, is that really a bad thing?  Just kidding.  Just kidding.

I would recommend JP II if you are in the mood for a mindless adventure.  I would recommend JP III only if you have a dinosaur nut child and have already seen the other two movies."

There is this guy named Bill Shatner....
He is really arrogant....
He plays Captain Kirk....
The guy in the red shirt always dies...
There is something called a Star Trek convention.....
Bill Shatner said ST convention fans should ""get a life"" on national TV.....

Really the movie is much funnier if one understands all these things.  I suppose it would be even better if I had shown him an episode of ST first but I was too lazy to obtain one.

I should add to anyone reading this that one should also explain that Captain Kirk often ends up without a shirt  - there is a joke about that as well."

"event","Remember in Princess Bride when Inigo Montoya told Vizzini ""that word, I don't think it means what you think it means""?  I was reading the blog of a family in my younger daughter's travel group.  (Don't worry they don't know about this blog.)  Their new daughter has similar [mild] medical problems to those of my younger daughter.  So at the end of the blog there is this line about their daughter being ready to take on the world with the line ""Look out world -- here comes Princess Mindy!""

A princess is a pawn to be married off at a tender age to a king decades her senior to form a strategic alliance with a neighboring kingdom.  Her job is produce male heirs.  If the drinking and whoring the king did as a wild young prince decimated his sperm count, he'll blame her for being barren and poison her breakfast cereal so he can marry a new sweet young thing.  He will repeat this process until one of his young queens is smart enough to screw enough fertile palace guards to get pregnant without being exposed as an adulterer and getting her head lobbed off.

I'm confused.  Really does this sound like someone who would be likely to take on the world?  Is screwing a bunch of palace guards the taking on the world thing that princesses are doing?  That doesn't sound at all like something Disney should be working so hard to promote."

""You are NOT the boss!  You are just old!""

This is quote from my daughter.  Once she trashed her outfit 5 minutes before it was time to leave for school.  DH took her upstairs but she had great trouble deciding on exactly which outfit it would be.  In frustration, DH told her ""I'm the boss and you are going to wear this [the top-of-the-drawer outfit he had picked out]"".  Furious at being denied a prime fashion statement opportunity, she screamed at him ""YOU ARE NOT THE BOSS!  YOU ARE JUST OLD!""  She was a mere 3 years old at the time.  Now he thinks this story is funny.  At the time the humor was lost on him especially since I poured fuel on the fire by stopping in the middle of brushing my teeth to go lay on our bed and laugh hysterically.

And if anyone ever notices the inscription, it will make a good story.  DH is shy, you see, I'm just being helpful really."

"event","My biggest procrastination problem is that I'm not good about splitting the task into smaller more doable tasks.  I want to work on cleaning the pigsty room in my house until it looks like a show place even if it takes 5 solid hours.  I resist working my ass off for an hour just to have an improvement invisible to the naked eye and the knowledge that I have to find 4 more hours to complete the task.  But several consecutive free hours is almost NEVER going to fall into the schedule of a woman with kids under 5 therefore I have too many of these big tasks waiting on my to-do list.  Every summer J and I do half of what we need to do to get the garage in order so we can a) know where the &^*(%^* our tools are and b)get 2 cars into our garage.  By summer I mean we meant to do it during the summer but procrastinated until late fall, the last possible weekend before the temperature dipped below freezing (we have a detached unheated garage).  For the upteenth year in row, the second half of the cleaning is now planned for ""next summer"".  Meanwhile we only have room for one car in our garage.  The good news is we won't have to get the lawn furniture down from the rafters this spring.  Please don't ask we where the drill is.  I could find it given 20 minutes.  It is in the garage -- somewhere.

But this is not the weekend I will break this bad habit.  Today R was begging for chores to do so he could earn money for this Star Wars game his friends have.  So I used the opportunity to do my customary skip meals and work till it's done thing while R baby-sat.

I know I should feel bad about this but did I mention that my laundry room is a show place?  I don't have to weave back and forth to make it from the door to the washing machine.  Go ahead - ask me the location of the navy shoe polish."

"event","My son used his Barnes and Noble gift card to buy a Star Wars chess set.  Somehow it seems like I should be able to blame Dawn for this but I can't.  We tried to talk him out of it.  We have been warned by parents with older kids not to get a character chess set because, especially for a new player, it is really confusing when all four rooks, castles, and bishops look different.  Parents must have been complaining about this because at least on this set there is a picture of a normal rook/castle/bishop on the base of each piece.  Oh well, it was his gift card and it is pretty funny moving pieces like C3PO around.  Need I mention that the pawns are empire clones for one side and stormtroopers for the other side?  And that the dark side bad guy pieces are black?

My husband was playing with him earlier.  He thought he had put my son in check but it was in fact my son's queen.  I wonder if all those chess champions out there would be able to cope with the weird pieces?"

My girly-girl was giving him no end of trouble about getting dressed.  She badly wanted to wear the new dress my mother had given her for Christmas with the matching purple tights.  Finally DH said in frustration: ""if you don't start cooperating, I'm going to dress you in the ugliest thing I can find"".  I had to stop packing and lay on the bed laughing.  I was sure she was going to call his bluff but she seemed concerned ""what would that be?"" she said solemnly.  She was perfectly behaved for the rest of the dressing process.

Where are the flowing wizard robes?  The second Dumbledore looks like he is in a bathrobe, but I digress.  And Alan Rickman as Snape pulling back his sleeves theatrically before whacking some boys on the back of the head.  How fun was that?  I also got to drool over young men half my age.

"event","My husband and I took four 9-year-old boys and our girls sledding and had a rockin' time.  We returned the extra kids to their parents completely exhausted.  This year we didn't have quite enough equipment, we had three sleds and a snow board for four boys.  Snow boarding requires more concentration and has more spectacular wipe-outs so after a while all the boys wanted to use a sled.  Based on what happened last year we thought the girls would beg to go home after wipe-out #1 so surely 4 boys could share 3 sleds and a snow board for the 10 minutes that would take.  I'm sure you see where this is going.  We were sadly mistaken.  I had to leave to go get another sled from a friend's house.  Last year my middle child and I wiped out the first time down.  She put her hands on her little 3-year-old hips gave me a disgusted look and said ""I have snow all over me!"" and refused to go down again.  At the time it bruised my ego.  I can't really be raising a daughter to be afraid to go sledding because she might get dirty, can I?  It wasn't even dirt!  I did all those bad parent things you should never do.  I begged her to go down with me again.  I made promises I couldn't keep ""I promise we won't wipe out next time"".  Like I could do anything about some teenager loosing control and mowing us down?  ""If you just try it, you will have fun I promise.""  But no dice.  This year she thought it was incredible fun, it probably helped that I was extremely careful to avoid wiping-out not that it is really completely possible.  Even my youngest agreed to go down with me.  I'm tired though.  Turns out helping 2 toddlers get back up a slippery hill while hauling a sled uses some muscles I don't normally use.  (My husband has a bad back so he doesn't go down, he is just there make sure the boys don't do something too stupid and/or to call the EMS when they ignore him.)"

"event","So all my friends laugh at me because my second child, 4, is one of the more girly girls on the planet.  I used to be more girly when I was little but now I'd have to say I'm more of a tomboyish person and my friends tend to be tomboy female engineers.  Almost all of them spawn boys who start a 3 year Thomas the Tank Engine obsession the second they hit 18 months of age just like my oldest did.  They view my interactions with my second child as free entertainment.  Even my girl-mom friends laugh at me.  One friend gives me hand-me-down dance recital outfits, the most over-the-top frothy ones she can find, for my daughter's dress up bin.  She has a tendency to give them directly to to my child so they can't mysteriously disappear.  My second cared not for trains.  She will go along with anything if she thinks it is primping.  My son cried at the haircut place when he was 4 (the year I decided to fire myself as his barber before I accidentally got him with the scissors during his flailing).  My daughter sat perfectly still and smiled at herself in the mirror at 2.  Two years later she won't get off the seat to get her sucker unless at least one hair care product is used ""you forgot the shiny hair stuff, Mrs. Kim"" much to the amusement of my stylist.  First dental appointment?  Beforehand I was worried, my husband assured me ""she will think it is primping"" on his way to work.  He was right.  ""I'm going to get shiny teeth"" she said enthusiastically to everyone at the dentist's office.  So I've been trying to get in touch with my girly side.  Last spring, Kim, my really cool hair stylist, recommended these spiral curlers one can get cheap at Target.  They are these long soft rods and they are bright pink.  Need I say that she lives for pink things?  Somehow I managed to make her hair look descent for weird hair day at school last spring.  Ok, so the spirals were a little tighter on one side and basically fell out by the end of the day.  Ever since she has been begging me to make her spiral curls again so today so I did.  It is kind of a long process, her hair won't take the curl unless I wet it and blow dry it.  She has really straight slippery hair so it is really hard to get these things to stay in even though these things have a rubbery surface.

Her hair looked, well BAD, when I was done.  It wasn't spiraled that is for sure.  It looked like a severe case of bed head.  She was so disappointed in me.  Her hair looked nothing like the picture on the package.  She kept solemnly asking me ""why does it look this way?""."

"event","War broke out on another blog I read on this subject.  ""Why don't we raise our own children first?""  ""Why didn't you adopt from foster care?""  This is an issue I've dealt with.  I've adopted twice from China.  I used to get very defensive when asked why didn't I ""just adopt from foster care"".  For some strange reason I felt that I had to defend my choices.  Adopting a child who has been hurt by their biological parents is much much harder blah blah blah, I'd explain.  And really it was so silly.  I was always asked by someone who had biological children and never had any intention of adopting a child from foster care themselves but who thinks it would be really nice for society if I did it.  And I got defensive about MY actions?  What WAS I thinking?  Did I ever ask anyone why they had biological children instead of adopting from foster care?

Wouldn't it be nice if I could volunteer some people adopt or foster all the children in the foster care system?  How about infertile people?  Because the foster system needs inexperienced parents.  Then I wouldn't have to feel so bad about all the children languishing in the system without actually having to do any of the hard work of helping a hurt child myself.  Maybe I should tell all the brawny people I run into that they should go down and build houses in New Orleans.  I'd do it but I'm scrawny you see.

I'm sorry, I guess I don't buy the ""just asking for information"" gambit.  Anyone who can pick up a newspaper ought to have some inkling of the difficulties facing foster parents.  What is really happening is do-goodism by proxy.  Yes, I agree, it would be nice if we could volunteer others to do good works.  Well, except for that tiny-weenie problem that the last thing the average foster child needs in another disrupted placement due to well-intentioned but under-prepared parents.

I have met some foster parents and these people are my heroes.  But it has to be something one wants to do.  If one doesn't like painting, one can spend a weekend doing it anyway for Habitat for Humanity just because it is a good thing to do.  But you can't do something really difficult that you really don't want to do day in and day out for years and do a good job of it."

"event","Before I had children I always enjoyed getting photo Christmas cards.  I store all the cards together and I never have to wonder who the kid is or when - it says ""The Smiths - Christmas 2005"" right on the card.  So now I do it every year but instead of stressing out about something worthwhile like the plight of Katrina victims I stress out about how I'm ever going to obtain a photograph with all three children smiling and facing the camera?  Well for another year I have that monkey off my back.  I might even get the cards back from the photo place and in the mail before Christmas.  Of course, my younger two are wearing swimsuits in the photo because that is what they wear indoors even in the dead of winter. I decided wearing swimsuits in front of a Christmas tree would be whimsical instead of toddler battle avoidance.  Hey, I can be whimsical if I want to, really."

I'm not sure how long my addiction will last.  It is definitely a game one would want to play on a computer.  I hate having to erase things on paper.  Before long I've torn the paper.

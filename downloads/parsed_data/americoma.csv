"event","Day in and day out I grow more attached to the empty feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I have no reason to believe that I will ever be so fortunate again, I blew my chance.
I wish that things were different, so different that they merely replicated the opposite.
I want things to return to what I once fooled myself into believing, would always be normal. 
I don't know what I am doing and my life is spiraling in ONLY the ways I care not to travel.
Please someone come visit me, I don't think I need what I once needed, I have come to terms with myself.
I want my life back......
after all....

What good can come of life, if you spend every waking minute trying (with all your might) to deprive yourself of the one thing that truly gratifies you?

"event","I ventured to Rilo Kiley last night with my two best friends, Jennifer, and Liz. All was extremely well, save for the fact that halfway through, while listening to the Country time lemonade man sing, I got this gut feeling that I should have resigned from this night before it happened. I looked at Jennifer, and how much she was holding back emotion during that show, ""could it have been present had I not been?"" I kept wondering, and then I got morbidly depressed because I thought of all the times Liz has Jenny all to herself, maybe once a week if it happens, as for me, I get Jennifer all other open slots, maybe 5-6 nights a week, all to myself. Liz has been with Jennifer for too damn long to have to settle for second best, so I decided once and for all, that Liz and Jenn, need to get out more ALONE, as do me and Casey, and Jake. I feel all to regrettably (sp?) sorry and in debt to Liz, and Jennifer. 
Sorry girls,
Cody"

"event","Well it has been another 2 months since my last post,
And I would not be updating had my life not taken a saddening twist this afternoon, well anyways with my brother in California playing in a soccer tournament, and my parents off to my moms tumor surgery, I was left alone with my little sister, so bored out of my damn mind (without Jennifer) I took my sis to see any movie of her choosing, and just my luck she chose 2 Fast 2 Furious, I mean I don't have anything against those souped up rice rockets.....oh wait....yeah I do! Uhh well the movie was very predictable, I was less than entertained. After that I took her to lunch at Barbacoa,... and once at my house I came upon my somber parents that had just arrived from the doctors office... It appears that during the surgery my moms fucking organs collapsed, and she momentarily died. My mom was without a fucking pulse for like a minute, well I am sure my dad was hating life watching the woman he loved collapse into a lifeless heap. She would've died had some little nurse lady not shoved a tube down her throat to reopen her airway and get some life flowing through her. It worked and she is now resting peacefully on our couch. Fuck life, fuck the stupid drama, and struggles that ensue when life is threatened, I hate it, and MOST of all I hate that Teri (Jenn's manager) said that I can not call/or visit Meier and Frank anymore, I mean I called a couple times today but immediately hung up once I realized the girl on the other end was not my girlfriend. I need someone to talk to, and the only person that I can talk to works all damn day, and gets off when I go into work for the night. Oh well, I hope she is still planning on sleeping at my place tonight, maybe she will let me talk to her about this then. I would really feel better if I could talk to someone about this besides my damn keyboard.
Attn: Back to my mom, umm she has had ovarian cancer for the last 2 years, and well after the surgery, and prognosis today the doctors announced (drumroll please) that it is returning in full force.... what the fuck do we have doctors for, why in the godforsaken hell does my mom go to the doctors 2 times a week for two years.....FOR FUN? I think not, the damn doctors are sitting around with thier dicks in their hands,... pickup the damn rule book, and play fair you fuck of a god, or whoever have you. I need a better family life, I need my parents to live......live together happily, I feel as though my mom could go any day now, I mean she almost did today what is stopping her from going tommorow, or the next day? I guess only time will tell...but I must not show her how weak I am becoming inside, she needs to think positive, and so do I. 
I miss my girlfriend......
Sincerely yours,
Jameson Cody Westerfield"

"event","It has been a good two months since my last post, I do not even know why but I have not had the energy to bring myself to sit down and rattle on about my life. And suprisingly today I found the energy to write an entry at 8:00 am, I am never awake at 8:00 am let alone concious enough to compose my thoughts into one organized piece.
Well in one short sentence,..life has been good to me the last 240 days, Jennifer has turned my life around. I cannot even imagine having to go through a day without talking to her, letting alone not seeing her. I am now to the point in this relationship where I literally need her to keep rotating through life like I have been the past 8 months. I feel that I have now gained a good grasp on my life, and future with this woman, I have two steady jobs, which are both going wonderfully, the only downside to my life the last week or so, is my lack of my Jennifer, I really used to spend eight hours a day with her, and now we are down to maybe 2 or 3 hours if we are lucky. The only time that I get to see her for a period longer than 4 hours is if I crash at her place, and usually in that scenario we will cuddle until we decide, OK...time for sleep and then then to attain sleep we must seperate and take our postitions at the opposite ends of the bed to finally retreat to silent slumber. OK OK OK, I'll admit it, I just want to see her more, alot more. I am sorry if you find that selfish, but I am off at work to get money to support our life together, and now we do not even have much of a life together.
I will be back soon......

"event","I fucked up, and I am not gonna reiterate what happened as all of you out there are also on Jennifer's (frevrisadrtywrd) friends list, if you need some refreshing just go and read her most recent post. Well anyways, back to my mess of a life. A couple days ago I really messed up, and it was the first time that Jennifer had asked to be alone, I was crushed, not unlike her, but really I was heartbroken.
And yesterday morning I journeyed off to Jennifers house to await my ""punishment"" I stepped into her house and joined the hesistant chit chat that ensued for about 2 seconds before I stepped up to her and wrapped my arms around her, I really needed to just hold her. And as dumb as it may sound,  even after what I did and all, I really felt Jennifer's love while we held eachother.
Anyways I took Jennifer out to lunch, and we started to fall into our former state, you know the happy couple that all of you LJ readers read about. It was nice to know that after what went on, we still were able to laugh together, with no stupid wierdness. I really was thankful that Jennifer has not permanently booted me from her life, and to tell you the truth I would've completely understood had she done so. I will respect Jennifers choice no matter what she chooses to do with me. I back that girl up 110%, and will not argue with her decisions.....ever. 
I love Jennifer Reed very, very much..
I love you baby girl........

"event","Sorry about the dealy on my birthday entry, but late is better than never, so here it goes.........
Well I turned the big 19, and I threw a little party,
At the party was Jennifer, and Liz, as well as Casey, Jake, Ed, Seth, Rob, Parker, Matt, Carly, Natalie, Colin, Joe, and my little brother Casey. I think that this list totally entails everbody, well the night started young, I arrived at the house a little earlier than 5:00 pm with my friends, Casey, Jake, and Ed, we started to decorate what was to be, an awesome spectacle of a night. We started by hooking up all of the strobe lights, black lights, and fog machines, and after that we hauled in the many boxes of alcohol, and filled the bathtub with about 20 bags of ""super ice"", the solar bar was quick to be set up, inside the bar (bathroom) we put a black light, and then glow in the dark star stickers on all of the hard alcohol bottles, and it looked awesome. After that I left my friends to tend the house while I ran home for a quick shower, People started to arrive at about 7:00 pm, and the party got cranking, my friend Casey bought me a little metal cellphone in a leather hip case, that looked exactly like a phone but in all actuality was a flask, which was filled and emptied with Crown Royal a few times during the night that awaited me. Jennifer and Liz arrived bearing gifts, and balloons, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, replacing my birthday cake, and to be honest I do not think that my friends minded one bit, when they want to eat, they want to eat, they do not want to take time to cut the cake, and scoop up some ice cream, it is much easier to snatch a doughnut out of a box. Jennifer got me a nice portable CD player, a nice nice Sony one, and the Audioslave CD, which was also used time and time again during the night. She wrote me a cute little card also, I love that cute little girl to death. Well Yeah a couple days ago my friend Jake cashed in on his present, he took me to ""his guy"" Shelby Dee and got me a tattoo, I will admit I was a bit nervous until the needle plunged into my skin for the first time, which flooded my body with relief, I mean it hurts like hell at some points, but it is still nothing compared to the severe back beating that I got myself prepared for. Damn assholes trying to scare me, all well, we arrived at Shelbys trailer in Magna, and upon entry I could not hear myself think over the loud Rob Halford cranking in the background, he had an adorably cute little pitbull named Magis, she was so damn cute. I want a dog like that. Well my friend Jake was first up, he pulled up a seat and gracefully received a beautiful color recreation of an Italian flag on his back, I was up next.......SHIT, I thought, I got myself ready for it and took the poll position, and it was then and only then that he delayed, he slowly meandered around the kitchen, I was thinking.......c'mon bitch, hit me with your best shot. But I guess he did not hear, after about 10 minutes of wearing out my nerves he sat down and proceeded to pierce my skin, it kind've hurt at first, I quickly discovered the art of proper tattoo recieving, once I hear the needle cranking I had to look down, if I was looking at Jennifer, she expected me to talk to her, and I don't know about all you tattoo sporting men out there, (Oz and Bonez) but it just was not easy to talk while he was working on me, call me a wuss but I could not bring myself to carry on a full fledged conversation during those 45 minutes. He finished the whole design a little under an hour from when he started (SC/DC) that is what it says on my right shoulderblade, SC/DC, it represents my favorite band AC/DC, I know it is misspelled, but that brings you to believe that my tattoo artist is illiterate when really I meant perfectly well for it to clearly spell out SC/DC, it represents my family.
S being my little 13 year old sister Savanna
C being my little 17 year old brother Casey
D being my 42 year old dad Darren
and
C being my 42 year old mom Cindy
I really like this tattoo for a few reasons......
1. I hand drew the design that was laid upon my back
2. It represents my favorite band, as well as how much rock music leads my life.
3. It represents my family.
Well I was happy to get it, I think that I might scan it when I get done with school and go over to Jennifers house, so if you want to see a few pictures of it, check back with this entry in a couple hours,
Well back to the party, the damn smoke machine would not quit, it was kind've cool for awhile, but damn it got so bad in the pool room.
Well Jennifer and I were not together as much as I would've liked at this party, whenever I would turn around it seemed that she ran off somewhere.......
Well my little brother poured 19 shots of Crown Royal (19 shots- 19 years old....get it?)
Well we dispersed them throughout some of my friends at the ""fiesta that's the besta"" which left everyone with about 2 shots of Crown, everyone held thier glasses towards the sky and shouted out various nice remarks towards me, and on three everyone chugged whatever glasses were in thier hands, which left about 10 people with oddly shaped cringes on thier faces. Well it was about that time that Jennifer, and I started to work in slow motion, all I wanted to do was lay, so that I did.
Jennifer and I set up a big blanket bed downstairs and Jenn, Liz, and I proceeded to fall asleep, the next morning I pushed Jenn and Liz out the door at like 9:30 am, and then the guys and I just sat around sharing strange stories of the night, I found out that.............
Rob, Casey, and Ed all puked and passed out....
Colin just plain old passed out........
Robs right shoe was puked in by an anonymous being.........
Rob's jacket was urinated all over by Royal the miniutare greyhound...........
Rob was urinated all over during the night as he passed out under the toilet.............
As you can see for my 19th birthday I really cannot complain,
I had a wonderful time with wonderful people,
Thanx Jennifer for making it a wonderful night
I love you.....
Cody"

"event","Jennifer and I have been hanging out like mad lately, (suprise, suprise huh?)
Well today, I woke up and got my ass outta bed by like, wait wait wait! lets start from the beggining, Last night I got off of work at like 10:30 and ran home to find my fucking brother in my room. But I decided not to yell at him, we have been getting along alot better lately, as he has a new ""girlfriend"". I really hope that things workout between him and his little lady friend, because in my experience I have learned that women have an enormous effect on the male sex. And she being a mormon (she has never smelled beer, let alone hit the bong or some shit like that) My little mind goes on to hope that she is the best hope that I got to get my brother off of this one way track to the state penitentiary in a year. He will be arrested for the distribution of narcotics if he does not change his ways, and if this girl can help him ""kick"" the habit then I will be forever in debt to her. Well onto my little ""love slave"" Jennifer, like I was saying, after waking up, eating, and going to three fucking hours of stupid classes at SLCC, I arrived at Jenn-Jenns house. Upon entry we of course fell asleep for like an hour, then she got dressed and we left in search of an orgasm for my stomach (I was pretty hungry), we ran to my house, so I could grab my dinero to go toss it into the bank, I had about $100.00 that woulda been spent tonight had I not deposited it. So we ran over to the drive-thru at my new Zion's bank, first off I could not get the damn plastic can out of the plastic tube, So I was like ""what the fuck"" and the lady in the window was like ""can I help you?"" after figuring this can this can thing out, I put my money in the can and then I threw it out my window for some reason, and Jenn laughed her ass off, and ran around my car to recieve my can. Well onto more important stuff, Jenn and I ran to Bean's and Brew for our favorite Tan Iced mochas, and we followed it wit some nice filling food at the Old Spaghetti Factory, I never ever leave that place unsatisfied in the least. I was stuffed, but then Jennifer and I went into some store and while she was looking at bracelets and I uhh stole a stone heart for her. And once we got back into the Legend, we rode out ot the new 6 story library in Salt Lake City, and we uhh got some cd's and books for my new research project in English on Alternate energy sources. Fun Fun. Well now I am talking to you people on the internet, so and I am now done, so goodbye.
Laters All, until next exciting episode of Cody and Jenn's life together
This is Cody (and Jenn) saying goodbye."

"event","Here I am in fucking English class, whoopadeedoo! 
But I get to go to Jennifers house at 11:00 (after 2 more classes), and I think we will hang out until about 2:00, because I NEED to get some more sleep before work, and hopefully Jennifer will come in and eat with Liz tonight, I would really like to see her there at Tuscany.
Last night Jennifer came over to my house, and we left my house mere minutes later due to the overcrowding and the smoke filled basement, we had a few uncle's, aunt's and cousin's over for no real apparent reason. Jennifer got me to ""slightly reluctantly"" climb into her Camry, and we headed for the big S.L.C. Once there we headed for the best Sushi this side of Japan, The Happy Sumo. We ordered an order of California Rolls, and Veggie Spring Rolls. That is the best Japanese/Chinese food that I have ever eaten. I really love that place, and I think that Jennifer does too. Good, good. Well yeah after that it was ""chick flick sunday"", so we walked upstairs and saw ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" with Kate Hudson, and that other guy. It was predictable but very cute for the most part. Honestly I think that I like those type of movies more than my girlfriend, I like ""chick flicks"" in some weird way. Well onto a topic that won't get my ass kicked. After the movie we drove back towards the South Valley, and we stopped at 7-11 and Jenn talked me into talking her into getting a Dreeaamm Donut, we walked out with the usual munchies, and headed towards my house. We arrived, and went down to my room, and I made the biggest mistake of all.........telling Jennifer that I made an autobiography (babypictures included) in the 3rd grade. I busted it out and Jennifer read every page although I told her not to, which made me feel good to know, that I do have a girlfriend that does care about my life. After that Jenn and I kind've slept, and then she left at about 1:30.
I love that girl-

"event","Here I am all decked out in my dumb work outift waiting until the last possible minute before I must leave. Some nights I look forward to working, y'know making some money, tonight, unfortunately, is not one of those nights. Jenn has the night off,
and those rare nights that I work while she plays are the nights that I fear Tuscany. I would much rather go out to a movie, or go swimming with her than even have a $300.00 night. Fuck money, all I need is Jennifer. In fact the only reason that I am working so much is for Jennifer, her and I are hopefully going up to Seattle in a couple months, and to save money for that trip, I must first dig myself out of debt. I still owe about $350.00 on my stupid car, and about $600.00 for school. Fuck school. 
   Today, Jenn and I went out to ""lunch"" at Papa Johns on her lunch break, she was working, while I was playing. She got a beautiful looking order of Cheese bread Sticky thingys, which are still sitting on my kitchen counter. Well anyways to the climax of my story, Jenn left her purse in my car, which inevitably means that I get to see her tonight, I acted sad, but on the inside I was glad. I dread the nights that I must go home to siberia like tempurature dungeon, and fall asleep.......alone. I want to atleast see her tonight, it will be the best part of my night........hands down. Well I had better get off to the factory.
Laters all you nonexistent readers.
Come Again.

"event","Here I am drunk as shit in my friend Rob's office. 
Tonight, was quite drawn out but suprisingly enjoyable.....
The night started out with me driving in the fog to meet some friends at a local middle school. I met about 15 people and umm I drove to my house to collect a large boxful of alcohol except for the Skyy vodka which I plan to save for Jennifer and I this sunday night when we hopefully go to Lehi. Well we went to Robs house and played pool, but I mostly socialized tonight with old friends like Shane, Seantae, Derek, Rob, and Seth. The only thing that could've been better besides having Jennifer with me, wouild be a better choice of music, most of these guys like shit like Justin Timberlake, and other rappy shit like that. If I had it my way we would be listening to umm Beastie Boys, Motley Crue, or oddly enough Ani Difranco, I watched her DVD today, and ever since I have been really in the mood to hear her, and I have yet to get drunk to folk music. Good times. Well yeah so far tonight I have consumed.....
1. 3-5 cigars
2. A single St. Ides 40 oz. malt liquor
3. 3 mixed drinks (cranberry schnapps and ornage juice)
4. 2 hot chocolates containing an enormous amoutn of ammaretto
5. 2 shots of Absolut citron vodka
6. A glass or two of Landmark chardonnay
All in all I am pretty fucked, I have to retype EVERY word in this journal, and I still proabably fucked up the spelling. Well earlier tonight I rode a wheelless skateboard down the 16 stair staircase at about 2:30, and I think I fucked up my wrist, which only further impairs my typing ability. I am feeling wonderfuil right now, but I KNOW that tommrow I will be hurting like a motherfucker, but until then I am gonna party like it's 1999. I have to be at Executive Stylists in about 8 hour for a haircut, Yeah Jenn no more mullett. I prbably should get home, I mean if I stay here, I have no access to an alarm clock, and without a clock I WILL miss my haircut for sure. I will probably leave in an hour or so. I tink I need to take my friend Seth home with me, he has been throwing up all night, and now he is passed out in the bedroom, I kind've want to get him home, I knwo how it is to wake up in a house other than your own with a hell of a headache. in short it sucks, Well I need to be going I am up in pool.
Bye bye LJ, until next time.

"event","Last night started off with me leaving Jenn's house at about 5:00pm, with hopes of getting back together with her later in the evening. As I soon discovered that wouldn't all go to plan. Upon arrival at my house I noticed an unfamiliar car, which was immediately paired with a very familiar face at my doorstep. It was one of my best friends Ed. He ran down to my car, and we retreated indoors to catchup a bit, I haven't seen his ass for like 6 months now, I think. It was nice to know that he was still alive and somewhat well. It wasn't the best timing though because I had to run and finish buying an anniversary present for Jennifer, so I decided to make him part of it, so we left in search of Fashion Place mall. And we found it, considering the fact that it is like ONE damn mile from my house. We messed around in various stores for a good hour or so, Ed was trying to pick up women but he doesn't know how to go about it, so he does what any man would do, make an ass of himself, we went into department stores and one of had this little piano/karaoke machine for kids. I busted out the Elton John and laid down a nice solid paino track, and Ed sounding more like a dying weasel comes in trying to sing Frank Sinatra or something, and he was singing this one line about how this store is only for old people as two old ladies were walking by, I have never seen a scarier face from an old lady ever. They wanted to kill us. Well then we went into the home decorating department and Ed put a lampshade on his head and threw out a few ""chinese sounding"" words, unaware that a chinese couple was standing right behind him. Funny kid. Then we went and looked at some cologne products, cause Ed thought that the girl behind the counter was cute, and he was looking at this wierd ball shaped cologne bottle looking more like a grenade than cologne, he was like how does this work and he squoze it, and  a extremely large dosage of rather potent BOSS cologne was shot into his eyeball at quite the high rate of speed. We had to then go to the bathroom to wash it out. After that we went into a few various stores and I made a few various selections which I will not mention for fear that Jenn might read this before recieving her gifts. Ed's stomach started to rumble so we went and hopped in the Legend to go eat, but I had to call Jennifer, so we cruised home first, and to what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a little white camry, which filled me with cheer. Jennifer was at my house, and after a few minutes she left, and I was supposed to get ahold of her later in the evening to hang out. I did just that and she felt like the third wheel so she graciously denied my request to hang out. So Ed and I left and went to Fazolis Italian food, and Ed ordered like 20-30 breadsticks and the breadstick lady came by and Ed ordered even more. That kid amy weigh a little less than me, but damn can he eat. Well then we hopped on the freeway and drove to Lehi, and I got to visit Ed's house for the first time, it is really nice, but not very comfortable considering the fact that it has no carpet, it is all tile. Ed grabbed his trunks, and we went to the pool, donw in Lehi there is this like hot springs pool thingy, it is huge, it has a large pool, a diving board, and two hot tubs. Nice, I was in heaven. So Ed and I fucked around for a bit, doing dives and shit off the board, and talking about women in the hot tub for an hour or so. It was cool because it was so foggy that you can't make out anyones face, you can't really see too far in front of you, but if you look up the stars are so damn bright, and you look over and there is Utah lake, no more than 50 feet into the distance. It was heaven on earth. Well when the pool closed at 11:00 Ed and I got out, we were the last ones there. And we left again to go to downtown Salt Lake city, so we cranked on some Korn, and hit the freeway, and about a half an hour later we were there. We drove around and then went to Salt Lake Coffee Break, although I didn't really feel like coffee. So Ed and I got a strawberry and kiwi Italian Soda. We plopped down on the couch and started to aimlessly scratch the table with our keys, and then I made a design that said Jenn + Cody, and then one that says Cody loves Jennifer. Also two more that stated CKY and Korn. Fun stuff, and then our friends Lindsay, Kat, Chelsea, Kiley, Noel, and this other girl walked in the door, and plopped down next to us, and our new friend Anthony, he was this kid that was writing this 1000 page book on reciepts, and since reciepts turn black his book was already like halfway disspeared. Cool stuff, I was so intriuged, I sat and talked to him for like an hour while Ed was talking to the ladies. Good luck big guy. And we talked to the girls for a good hour or two and once it hit the 2 o'clock hour we were nice and ready to sleep, so all of us left, and Ed and I drove home, and he went to bed, and I think he masturbated while I was in the shower, but as long as I don't see the shit good for him. So we retired to silent slumber, and I woke him up 7 hours later for his first day of college today. Well that about wraps up my night. Gotta go to bed, bye bye all."

"event","Well here I was hopeful as hell that this party would go all to plan. God knows with the majority of my friends, save a few (Jenn, Liz, and Casey) I am solely responsible for all festivities this evening. And if I FUCK up the night, I won't recieve a thank you for the party, in fact I really don't remember getting a pleasant comment like that all night last night. Oh well, everyone was far too smashed to throw out any pleasantries like that.
Casey, Jake, Jennifer, Liz, and I all piled in Caseys Subaru Legacy, and headed for the west desert. It was about 6:00 when we left, and the doors to our ""awesome show"" did not open until 7:30, but I thought hell, y'never knwo what the fuck might happen, there could be a traffic jam, but in fact it was smooth sailing all the way there, we arrived at Saltair at fucking 6:30, the doors did not open for an hour, but we went in anyways. And just warmed up a bit. Jennifer and I were kind've distant at this point, it was truly sad for me. We really are not the same lovey dovey couple when others are present, and I guess that is just kind've hard for me to accept. I love to show her how much I love her, and I love to recieve the same treatment, but those times are few and far between while we have company. But then the show started and it was alright, there was this local band called Thunderfist on stage, they sounded to me, like a mix of Megadeth, Jackyl, and Ted Nugent on vocals. Really not a bad mixture, but I wasn't in the mood for that shit. It sure beat the hell out of what was to come as far as I am concerned. The next ""group"" was called Expression Music, Jesus Christ, my advice to anyone in the music biz, NEVER EVER give five or six white ""thugs"" thier own microphones, and tell them to make some ""phat beats."" It was so damn lame, they were like when I say_______ you say__________. I was like FUCK you I ain't saying shit, I don't know you. Who the fuck do they think that they are, getting on stage and trying to boss everyone in the audience around. FUCK them. Well, it was about this time, that I seriously considered leaving, it took me one look at Jennifer to see that she was crying for help on the inside, she wanted the fuck out of there. So once the next shitty band came on stage we left. Thank God. 
Well we picked up my car and I drove the girls to Mikes (my uncle's) house and we started to drink some of the $140.00 of alcohol that we bought. Jenn was shitfaced before the rest of the party got there. She was gone within a half an hour. It was so adorable to see the effects on her, while I was still somewhat sober. She was like walking around flailing her arms around. I fell in love with her, even more last night. Then Casey, and Jake showed up and I made some strawberry margaritas while the girls smoked on the back deck, and they really suprisingly weren't as bad as I would've imagined. We camped out in the living room for awhile and watched the best of Jackass on DVD. It was so much funnier when you are under the influence. Everyone was laughing thier asses off. And we hurried and flipped on Dick Clark with about 20 seconds until the ball dropped and so everyone darted into the kitchen to grab a drink for toasting. And at midnight exactly glasses were ringing together with four of my best friends, nothing better, thats all I gotta say. A little after the drop of the ball Pete showed up with three girls. I would say women, but they were not women, I was with the only two women at the party. Well then the party kind've moved downstairs, everyone just shot some pool, and got to know eachother. It was about this time that I really wanted to ""get to know"" Jennifer. While I am under the influence, horny times for me, are few and far between, but this was definitely one of them. She is so sexy. Well the rest of the night was really a blur, I remember visiting the bathroom 7 times with my baby girl while she threw up. Sad. I felt so bad. I should've watched her liquor intake closer. I am a fucking dumbass. I hope that she is feeling better now though. And Jennifer and I crashed on the couch together while Liz was ""safely"" at my side on the floor. I really did not want Pete to get too drunk and mess with her while she was asleep, and I bitched Pete out earlier that night, so I figure if she was sleeping within arms length of me, he wouldn't get near her. And as far as I know, he didn't. Well I Jennifer, and I went to sleep at about 6:00 o clock, and woke up at 11:15. I did a quick walkthrough of the house and cleaned it up, and then the three musketeers hit the road, in search of toothpaste, beds, and a nice warm shower. I dropped the girls off, and then dropped the film off to Wal Mart, so hopefully some of the pictures will bring back some more memories of the last night of 2002. Goodbye all......."

"event","It has been quite some time since I have clicked on the little white ""update journal"" icon. I mean I did earlier today, but that was followed by me typing a few nonsensical words and closing down LJ. I just haven't had the patience to write anything down, my life has been anything but boring. But I think it is just that time of year, the time of year where the only place that I want time to stand still is when I am laying in Jenns bed, with her holding me. Other than that I want life to crank up the speed until we get to some nice warmer tempuratures, and no fucking frosty mornings. The winter season wears me out, and I don't really do anything but work, and sleep, and go and spend time with my love Jenn. The summers for me are nonstop parties and all night boozefests, but I always have the energy to do it all again the next night. But in the not so wonderful wintertime, when I freeze my fatass off while sleeping, I constantly find myself searching for some lost energy. Well until the summer Jenn had better be prepared to deal with an extremely onry boyfriend. Sorry Jennifer.
Well good news, Santa did not forget about me, and neither did my family or friends. Even though my friends this year consisited of 2 people (Jenn and Liz). It is really sad how relationships change, and friends are lost in the process. I mean two of my best friends Casey and Jake slowly dissapeared from my life, and I had no say in the matter. Deja Vu' huh?
I can do nothing but cross my girl-sized fingers and hope that they call me, and we go back to our wicked ways. We were the fucking Beastie Boys of Brighton High. I miss the parties we had, and the breakfasts that we would catch after those fucked up nights. But times change, and if Jennifer took the place of them, (sorry Casey and Jake) but I would have it no other way. I am so over-the-top in love with that girl. I know that what we have is not something that you come across everyday. What we have is wonderful. 
Well lets get abck onto the subject of Christmas again. It was pretty good to me, Jenn spoiled me rotten. She got me so many awesome things, but I will not go on to name them all, for fear that I might leave something out, and there will be one ""Jennifer Reed Guaranteed asswhooping"" signed, sealed, and personally delivered to me. But the long list included, and autographed picture of Frank Carlton Serano Ferino (A.K.A. Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue.) And a beautiful Fossil Watch, it is really good looking. 
She also got me a few CD's like CKY and Taproot's newest CD, they both rock my world. And I got to se her alot lately thanks to no school, and no work for the last 2 days. I saw her on X-mas eve night from about 6:30 to about 11:30, as well as X-mas from about 2:00 to about 12:30. Good times, I will include what we did on my next entry, my friends from Kansas just showed up for dinner gotta go. bye Bye"

"event","Jenn is fattening me up for the kill.....
Whenever we chill, which is everyday, she finds ways to purchase, or get me to purchase food at EVERY stop we make. If I keep eating that way we will never be able to sleep in the same bed again, at least not in a regular sized bed, I will need a 2X King bed just for my fat ass. And she would chill on a little twin bed next to mine. Sad, well yeah it is not like we sleep together anyways, I mean we sleep in the same bed together, but arm in arm, I think not. I am afraid to get to close to her, I have a tendency to spazmatically swing my arms in bed, and the last time we slept together, I punched her in the ear, and then retreated to peaceful slumber. God I am a worthless boyfriend. Well yeah, we slept ""together"" last night, only I was clinging to my side of the bed, as her little paws clutched her pillow on the other. No matter where, I fall asleep though, it doesn't matter, I could be half way off the bed, looking away from her. But as soon as I open my eyes, it is a sure bet that I am staring right at her peaceful ""innocent"" face. I don't know how it works but when we wake up we are always right in the center of the bed, gazing upon one another. It is wonderful, we just need to take some time out of our not-so-busy schedules, and learn to sleep with one another. I mean really sleep, holding eachother. I would love nothing more than to master the art of sleeping with her. I love you Jennifer.
Well tonight was god-damn exhilirating, we arrived at the Junction and I met all of Josh's friends, he runs with a pretty diverse crowd. I mean there were some rastafarian looking fools, and then there were like Brighton cheerleader types running up and throwing thier arms around him, saying, ""Oh I love you Josh."" I was like ""what the Fuck?"" Finally the show started, well wait, before the show my friend Jason fell down two flights of stairs while trying to outrun my other friend Austin. It was so god damn funny, and the stairs were metal. Hehehe. Once again finally the show started, the band was called Pair a Dice, I thought it was (paradise), but ah well. They were alright, they really weren't my thing, they were too umm repetitive, and simple, while at it. But I can't dog, on anyone doing better than me, at that sorta thing. But they ended thier set about an hour later. And the next band took to the stage for setup, and the guitarist's guitar case, said something like ""remember Jesus loves you"" or something, and they looked remarkably like Creed, so we were like Fuck it we are out of here. On the way out, I had some condoms in my car, and Moses, and Jake were opening them in my car, and throwing them out at people in the Junction parking lot, I think one went down this girls shirt. Well we needed quick replenishment, so we went to Morelias, And I got a big plate, I got the Larry Millers Combo and a strawberry margarita , and so did J. Fox. And once we were done eating we passed eth leftovers to Moses, and Jake, and they graciously accepted them. Well after that we drove to Jasons house, to get some shit for Moses, he is leaving to Vegas tommorow with Josh, I was supposed to go but I have to work. While he was in the house, Jennifer called me, and I wanted to keep talking to her, but she was practically pleading with me to get off the phone, so I obliged. I wanted to know if there was anything bothering her. I hope not, well I guess I will just leave her alone until I come to a conclusion. After they came out of the house I took the boys to Josh's house, and then I myself headed home before 10:00 for once. Well I honestly am tired enough to sleep already, and I don't have anytihng else to do, so goodnight.

"event","The last few days have very been event filled, but I have not been able to bring myself to create another post. I am fucking tired with 2 hours to go until I begin my finals of my first semester of college. I have studied moreso than I normally do for school tests, so hopefully it will all pan out in the end. I guess we will just have to wait and see *fingers crossed*.
Jenn was lucky enough to behold that awesome spectacle of Tori a couple nights ago, she sounded like she had so much fun. I am really happy for her. I was witness to the awesome spectacle known as my work that night. It was all worth it though cause I walked out with like $140.00 in tips, and the $100.00 the previous night, so for the time being I am rolling on Dubs. I get to live the champagne lifestyle with my favorite girl.
Speaking of which two days ago, the Tori concert night, was Jenn and my 3 month anniversary. Now some of you out there are like ""3 months, what the FUCK? 3 months ain't worth celebrating."" I on the other hand believe that it is, I mean why not have a night, where my girl and I can relish in our time spent together, why not have a night with a dash more romance than the others? But, well with Tori, and Tuscany, we were permitted from actually having a night out. And so we were forced to take the next availible slot, that's where last night came into play. I got off work at about 3:30 and Jenn was at my house by 4:00, we just laid in my bed for like an hour, and then I tried unsucsessfully to uncork a bottle of 1997 California Chardonnay. I uncorked the damn thing, but does it count if the cork ended up inside the wine? Well the cork will just give it a little flavor, maybe a little protien. And it will have time to soak, because I guess that we are not gonna re-uncork it until later this week, maybe next. But more on lastnight, we went to the Sapaghetti Factory, mmm mmm good, thats all I gotta say. We had mountains of food. I really don't think that I have ever walked out of that place NOT stuffed to the maximum capacity.
I had a nice half and half plate while Jennifer had the Spinach and Cheese Ravioli. We got out of there and ran to the Blue Botique for some goodies, just kidding, we just got some heated massage oil. That stuff is awesome, you apply it, and then blow on your skin, and it really gets hot. It feels really wierd, but good.
And then we ran back to my house and chilled for a while longer, and once Jenn left 8:30 to help me to study, I came across something that wasn't mine previously, Jenn snuck a anniversary present out on my dresser while I wasn't looking, it is a cute burned CD entitled appropriately ""Our December"" And upon closer exmaination I found that it is filled with awesome songs like Dilate by Ani Difranco, and Mayonaise by Smashing Pumpkins (our song) as well as more artists such as The Cure, Guns n Roses, The Anniversary (once again, titled appropriately) and even a Jewel song that I really like. I am the deepest form of love with that girl, this will not pass anytime soon....
Well I had better shower, and get my head back in the books.

I have been working and stressing out over the holidays a little the past week.
I have been working much more than usual, I went from my 25 hours everycheck to about 60 hours a check. And I am fucking exhausted.
I am the damn busser supervisor, so I also have to stay a damn half an hour after we close most nights and share some of my thoughts on my department, with the board of directors. I have to explain what we as a company should do to make the lives of our customers more enjoyable. FUCK THE CUSTOMERS. And I also have to suggest who in my department should be fired, and that is really hard considering the fact that I am now really good friends with every busser on staff. But they do want me to come up with someone by the end of the week, as I have provided them with a few ""responsible"" new hires. I am seriously leaning towards one of my good friends Mike, he just does nothing for Tuscany, and if we replaced Mike with my friend Joe, than hell it would make our lives as bussers easier. I do not, however, think that I am the right man for this job, I am not the type to fire people or narc on good friends. Who in the fuck does Tuscany think I am, do they think that I have no emotional ties with anyone from work. I am not some damn emotionless robot-for-hire. 
    On a lighter note, my love life is still rocking the boat. We are still kicking it everyday, and it is wonderful. I love to be with Jennifer. I wouldn't have it any other way, I am in love with my best friend. What could be better? That reminds me I get to start my heavy duty christmas shopping tommorow, as I get paid tonight. I am stoked for the holidays.
Well I need to finish getting ready, Jenny-girl will be here in a few minutes..............

And on top of it all, if I EVEN get the pleasure of her presence it will be for no more than an hour, maybe two. I mean here I was planning on taking her out to my familys party, and then we were gonna head to Bountiful together to go to her cousins house for her family party, and the best dinner was saved for last. Since my cute little vegetarian girlfriend is prohibited from eating about 90% of the thanksgiving dinners, her and I were gonna go back to her empty house and whip up some Tofurkey (tofu turkey) I have never had it. In fact I am pretty new to the whole world of tofu. Jenn actually introduced me to it. But I have eaten a few different types of tofu chicken and I cannot tell the difference between ""real"" or tofu chicken. Well I need to step off of this limb, and get back to my fucking point. What was it again? Oh yeah, umm yeah so since I am on the board of directors at my work as head of the bussers, *yeah bussers REPRESENT* I have to work from opening 11:00am to closing 8:00pm yeah that'll be a fucking awesome way to spend my damn turkey day. I thought with my new ""position"" I would get all sorts of benefits, but I guess with my unmentioned benefits comes resposibility, and here I am staring resposibility right in the face. I need to fucking work. I want to try to skate outta my resturaunt ASAP because I really will be heartbroken if I go through a ""holiday"" without being with my girl.  
I am on IM with her right now, until next time........

"event","I just had the best fucking sleep in my life. I slept from 1:00am to 12:00pm. Last night Jenn and I did something groundbreaking, we did something that made us both feel good. Not that. Instead of our usual run to a nice resuraunt and load up on heart-attacky foods, we went and did the exact opposite, we worked out together. And it was awesome. After she got off work at 9:00pm we ran to 24 hour fitness, and we started our workout. The only problem is that it took me awhile to get started because I was in such a unfamiliar place. It took me a few minutes to get used to my sorroundings enough to venture out, alone without my sidekick Jennifer. And even once I did, I porbably touched 5 various machines, I need to get a gameplan in that place, I will jsut bring my set list from my other gym next time. But I think that the best part of that workout was running alongside my baby girl for 35 minutes. It was sweet. She looked so cute when she was running. Hopefully I get to see her today. If she can't than I guess I can live with it, because I have some work that needs to get done around the house. Well I gotta go -

But I love it, I love the warm fuzzys I get strolling around downtown, or driving late at night, and seeing a single tree lit up with the holiday colors.
     I am also very well prepared with a special someone that I get to spend this holiday season with. We have one of those realtionships, you know the kind that even if she breaks my heart into little tiny pieces and the spits on them, we will still remain good friends for life, and I would really enjoy Jennifers company the rest of my time here, as a friend or, hopefully, more.
I have never been this in love with a person, I have never felt this way about a single person before. I am so over-the-top in love with this wonderful girl. 
     Yesterday Jennifer and I kicked it in Sugarhouse, we went to a few stores to get some more ideas for gifts for the holidays. But, honestly I was there with Jennifer, but at the same time, I was shoping for Jennifer, in my head. I think I realy had a few good ideas too.
     I am overworked, from now until the holiday season I should be working 6 nights a week, sad huh? I work I think Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, + Sun. But hell it should prove really good money, as long as I can stay alive just enough to keep what Jenn and I have going. But as soon, as my relationship with Jennavive starts to go downhill, I am going to quit Tuscanys so I can give sole attention to spending time with my baby. But until then, it is ""Livin La Vida Loca"" for me. Well I gotta go and catch up on rest for tonights work.

"event","Tonight I witnessed an awesome spectacle known only as the 2002 Pop Sux tour with Korn, and Disturbed. Trust Company was originally on the bill, but they bailed, oh well more time for the bands worth watching. Well first I will tell you about my morning.
I GOT TO SEE MY LOVE,.........JENNIFER.
I snuck into her house at 9:00 am, and we slept until 11:00, and upon waking up, our priorities didn't really change, we still remained in bed. I love to lay with her. It is god's gift to ME. Well I skated outta her crib at about 3:00. And I ran home and jumped in the shower, and ran to Caseys house. Casey and I then headed for Cottonwood Mall for a new snowboard jacket for his ass. He bought one for $220.00, back in my day, you could get a jacket for like $45.00. What in the hell happened. We ran to Caseys house and Jake was already there. After talking with Jake he said that he got bored waiting, and so he masturbated in Caseys bed. And honestly I did not know whether to laugh, because coming from Jake who knows if he really did. 
Well we had a concert to get to and so we left, E center in our crosshairs. Once we arrived in Jakes little Subaru Impreza. We went to park and while Jake was talking to the parking attendant, a literal waterfall of vomit came splurging from Jakes mouth.
I guess he had not eaten anything all day, and well he had some of Caseys nasty ass chewing tobacco, and well it kind've fucked him up. So it was back to Jakes house to change his shorts. The vomit covered his entire lap plus the drivers side floor, and a little splashed on me, and my disposable camera got a little in the lens. Well Jacob changed and we got back to the E center. This time in Caseys Subaru Lagacy wagon. On the way to the E center, I was drinking Bacardi Gold, and I must've had 10 shots by the time we got there. I was fucked. Then Casey chugged a little bit upon arrival, and puke boy had a couple shots. As we were walking to the E center, I stuffed a few ziploc bagged Primetime mini cigars in my underwear, and a disposable camera in my shoe. I stuffed it in about a hundred yards to early though it really hurt to walk with a fucking camera lens jabbing into the ball of your foot. Well we got inside, and down to the floor, and about 30 minutes of kicking it later, the lights shut off, and all hell broke loose, a few thousand people rushed the stage, knocking down the slow, or the weak. I saw a fe go down, so I ran up and helped them. There was also this little like 6 year old boy. So I snatched him off the ground and put him on my shoulders for a few songs. He was a nice little kid. But then his dad came and got him. Disturbed was crazy, I was snapping pictures like a damn National Geographic photographer. I know that I had to have some mad pictures in there. I hope. During one of Disturbeds songs I got hot, so I took off my overshirt, and threw it up on stage, and it landed at the feet of the guitarist. Well then after about 15 crazy mosh pit songs, Disturbed left, sad. Sad for Casey, and Jake cause they came for Disturbed but my fun was just getting started. During intermission Casey, and Jake scoped the ""hotties"" while I stood bystander. I am taken off the shelf, I do not even, honestly, check girls out anymore, it has no interest to me, when I am in love with someone else. Even though tonight was a guys night out, and a heavy metal show and all I still kind've brought Jennifer along, she was all I could think about or talk about. I am sure the guys got sick of me talking about her. Well the lights dimmed once more, and the main men Korn took the stage. I was about 10 feet from the stage, and I was going crazy, absofucking crazy. I took on so many guys that were bigger than me. At least I tried, I took a few straight shots tonight. As I sit here in the office typing this, my jaw aches from contact with someones shoulder, my eyebrow is bleeding from a fucking head butt, and my stomach is sore from all of the puches I took tonight. But I would damn near die, to see Jonathan Davis again. Well I was loving life until some big bastard grabbed me by the neck of my shirt, and threw me and then charged me with raised fists. So I did what I do best I acted tough. I was like ""it wasn't me you fucking asshole, suck my fucking ****"" I dunno when I get in a heated situation like that, words like that start to flow like water. But lucky for me, Casey and Jake grabbed him, and so I escaped a near asswhooping. Well after Korn we bailed and went to Village Inn. I am tired so tonight is over."

I have practically spent everyday from the past 2 months with her, and I couldn't want to see her more. This realtionship is going places, or at least that is what I find myself hoping/believing. 
I miss my girl already............

"event","Last night was just one of those nights, yknow those nights that even if not recorded in LJ, will always be remembered. Everything just seemed to go right last night. And my relationship with my sweetheart girlfriend Jennifer seemed to reach new heights. I know that it may sound funny to some, but for real, I felt something different (but pleasant) last night. I am in love with her.
Jennifer drove to my house at about 5:00 pm, and I was unaware just how young the night really was. We had one errand to run, I had to run to Tuscanys to grab a couple applications for a few friends. Now that I hold a management position at Tuscanys, I am solely responsible for molding, and recruiting the BEST team of server assistants for the holidays. So shit, why not recruit some of my best friends. I trust Seth with my life, why not let him strut his stuff at my work?, hell at least we will get rid of some of those shithead employees that give the rest of us a bad name. Well in route to Tuscanys I got this incredible craving for one of thier dinner pastas, and to my suprise Jennifer asked me if I would like to eat there. God she can read my mind. And so I put in our order, and it probably cost about $60, and my manager Al gave it to me with his compliments. That makes me want to work hard for him so much more. Not because of the obvious added benefits, nope, just because now I know that he really does notice, and appreciate the work that I do for him. Well we went home, and ate a wonderful Italian dinner, and my dad got a nice piece of that big chocolate cake. After that nice filling dinner. Jenn and I hit the road in search of greener pastures. Upon arriving to Seths dads apartment, we found 3 guys with a bottle of lotion, and girly mags scattered about in an unorderly fashion. Can you say circle jerk? Well, hell you never know what they might've done, and by the looks of it, niether did Rob. He was on his 2nd or 3rd Long Island iced tea. After about 10 minutes of various akward silences, the main men showed up. Seth, and Shane Cooper. And I gave them there applications, and they are going to meet with my boss tommorow, I will probably accompany them. Jenn and I decided to go and see a movie, and so we went to Century 16, and our moive (Jackass: the movie) wasn't playing for about an hour, and so we headed to Gateway mall to see if it had a better showtime there. Nope, they were even worse. So Jenn, and I went to leave, but got sidetracked by the fountain. So I parked, and convinced Jenn that she will not get wet, and there we were smack dab in the middle of the olympic insignia shaped water works. It was strangely romanticly arousing to me, I felt like we had ""a moment"". That is until Jenn and I got so much steam on our face that we started to get wet, and so we booked it to the new Virgin Records megastore. And after careful consideration, I got the new Chevelle CD, while Jenn got the older Tegan and Sara CD. (we later found out that they were both great CD's) Oh by the way, my babygirl bought me my CD, sweet huh? she is so good to me. But I was in need of about, yeah, about 2 hours of pure knock your socks off, kick your ass laughing. So it was back to Century 16 for Jackass. And oh my god, that show was so damn funy, I never laughed so hard in my life. And after the movie, we went back to Jenns crib, and kicked it for bit. Kicking it entailed:
*laying with Jenn
*listening to our new CD's
*kissing her goodbye
*telling her that I loved her (for the first time)
And I so do..............
Well, I am with Jenn now, and I am tired of having this computer in on the action, so I am gonna play a little one on one with my baby.
Well G/G Laters - Cody"

Last year my mom came down with Ovarian Cancer, and my brother spent a good deal of that year either locked up, or waiting trail. But lately my life has been wonderful. I finally feel like I am doing something worthwhile with my time.
* I found a really cute girl who seems to care alot about me.
* I feel like I am actually succeeding in school (for once.)
* My job promoted me to a manangement position two nights ago.
I want my life to fucking stay how it is right now, I mean a few things can change, like my mom can kick this cancer's ass, that would really be all that I can ask for right now. And I would absolutley love it if Jenn <3 and I kept getting closer from this day forth. I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed.

"event","Jennifer, has been somewhere else the past few days. I know that there is something that she is not telling me, and that does not help my ever-so-analytical personality. It is driving me insane. Things between us have somewhat changed recently, almost as if there is a new wierd vibe between us. I really hope that things pick up, I do not want them to go downhill from here. I really love my life ever since she became a part of it. I don't want to go back to living the single life, I love ""us"" together. I need to be the friend that she deserves and honestly ask her and figure out what is bothering her. I am worried that I did something that upset her. 
    Today I woke up at about 11:45 (10 hours of sleep) and went to lunch with Jake the snake. We went to get some bagels donw at Einstiens bagelry. Lunch was great, but I was more concerned with what followed lunch. Jennifer was supposed to meet me at my house at about 2:00. I was thrilled to see my baby girl. And sure enough she showed up (right on time) which was funny because I jumped out of the shower in like a little skimpy towel and start the commonly traveled path to my donwstairs bedroom, and there on the retro green couch sits Jenn. It was funny. I hurried and threw on some clothes, and the doorbell rang. Suprise for me. It was my best friend Casey. And double suprise for me, he has the night off, and he wants to kick it, don't worry I am not ditching Jenn, she is dithcing me, she has to work at like 6:00. Well Casey left, and Jenn and I decided to do what we do best. Sleep. We hopped into bed, and did not get out of bed for about 2 and a half hours. It was nice, I really needed that. But Jenn just left, sad. But tonight I am going to see a movie with the guys, and they are gonna have me sneak a bottle of peppermint schnapps into the movie theatre. And we are just gonna pass it around. Just like the good old days. It will be a riot. Rock that. Laters -

"event","Well this entry is gonna be a factual encounter of my life. Big suprise there huh? Well yeah yesterday was another day without my Jennifer. It doesn't affect me if I go a full day from anyone else in my life, EXCEPT Jennifer. So I had to stay busy. I woke from my bed at 11:30 and started right in on my homework, I did about 2 hours of that. And after feeling so good about actually working on my homework, I decided that I should try to feel better physically and so I headed to the gym for an hour. I popped in some early Guns'n Roses and did the eliptical trainer for a good hour. My life has been so nonstop that a workout is actually a break from life in my book. It was nice to get ot the spa. After that I quickly showered and got to work. And work was a bitch, I had three sections in three different rooms so I was constantly moving. After work I needed to go to sleep bad, so I ran home, showered and was in bed by 12:30.
   Today I woke up and went ot work for the Sunday brunch. It is usually really chill, but chill means no money. But I really was too tired to care about the lack of funds. Well I scraped outta work at 3:30 and I get to see my Jennifer in a couple of hours at 5:00. I am excited for two reasons:
1. I get to see her after two days, and just to hold her will     
   be wonderful.
2. We have two tickets to see Tommy Chong from Cheech and Chong 
   perform a live comedy act at Wiseguys comedy club.
My night is gonna rock out, because Justin is trying to go out on the town with Jenns best friend Liz tonight, and if all goes well after the comedy show, Jenn and I will meet up with them and hot tub, and shoot some pool at his house. Well better keep my fingers crossed.

First we read some of Perks of being a Wallflower to eachother, but that lasted a whole 4 pages. And after that she showed me a little bit about her favorite book by Kurt Vonnegaut, called Breakfast of Champions, it looks like it just makes a joke of todays lifestyle, and honestly. I would like to read it. After our inspirational reading session, we camped out for T.V. We just sat back and watched reruns of my favorite latenight HBO show, Sex and the City. I have honestly never had more fun with a person in a long time, if not ever. I really enjoy that girls presence. Well my teacher is being a beast, so I gotta run.

All I am stating is that I think Justin caught Liz's eye a little more than any of my other bachelors (like Jake for example.) Well I honestly hope that they do hit it off, it would be so awesome to double with Jenns best friend, and one of my best friends. Talk about a recipe for disaster. Fuck we would have so much damn fun. Well we went to Wiseguys, suprise, suprise. No but this time it was different. It was a ""special show"", and it was too. It was easily the funniest show that I have ever seen at that club. After that we went over to Hollywood Connections, and watched the Ring. Fuck that show scared me so bad. It totally jacked up my night, I mean imagine a nice, tall 18 year old boy running around his house from some little imaginary girl that he has never seen. I was too, I was scattering, last night while getting ready for bed, I did not stay in one place too long. Especially any room with a T.V. in it. I feel bad for Jenn, for having such a wuss for a boyfriend. But hell she is a tough girl, she barely flinched during that whole movie (and that was the most scared that I have ever seen her) if all else fails, my baby can protect me.

"event","I am extremely tired after work but the day would not feel complete without the construction of a new (probably miniscule) Live Journal entry.
My day also does not feel complete without a healthy dosage of Jenn. Today was the first full day in about 3 weeks that I have not seen Jennifer. Let alone the fact that I have not heard from my girl all day. And to be completely honest. I miss the hell out of her. It seems like I have not seen her since the 10th grade. She told me that it would be healthy for our relationship. I guess that she is right, if healthy is me contributing damn near 100% of my thoughts to her.
How is she?
What is she doing?
I hope she is having fun today........etc.
Well the good news is that I only have less than a full day until I get to see her beautiful face again. I am going to meet her tommorow at 6:00 pm after she gets off work at Meier and Frank.
We get to spend the whole night together. Thank God.
      Well just so I don't sound completely nuts over Jennifer, I will talk about my day, today my car loved me. I bought a new brake light for it, as well as a new strawberry air freshener, and after that I umm took it down to Supersonic for a nice car wash. And it ahs a full tank of gas (thanx to Jenn). Plus I took it into the shop today, and they changed and refilled all of my brake fluid. So needless to say, I spoiled the hell outta my car today.
And today, at Tuscany's we were filled with a waiting list all night, it was some pretty vigorous work, but at the end of the night I walked out with $60.00 in my pocket plus $30.00 on my paycheck. Not too bad for 6 hours of work. Well my bed is really calling me. I need to rest my eyes (for about 9 hours).
BY THE WAY, MY LITTLE BROTHER IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. I HOPE HE IS ALRIGHT.

"event","In fact for me right now, fun and games makes up a small majority of my time. 
The only fun and games that I do find time to enjoy, are those awesome moments that I share with my BEST friend/girlfriend Jennifer. I am completely nuts over her. She is everything that I want and need in a girl. I wouldn't have my love life any other way. And the best part of all is that Jennifer actually sees something in me. Something that I must've missed because I don't consider myself to be the most acceptable boyfriend. 
And luckily for me, just her presence is enough to keep me from fucking up my life, I really like what we have and I don't want anything to get in the way of what we possibly could have in the future.
My life is a cyclone of emotions, the only emotions that I am glad to have are ,of course, because of my girl. But other than that.....worry, anger, and confusion spend alot fo time rattling around in my brain. Jennifer must think that I have lost my fucking mind because lately (the last couple days) I have not been the same person at all, we both know it. There is only ONE reason that stands behind my reasoning for my withdrawn behavior, my damn little brother is throwing his life down the drain. And by that, I don't mean that he has chosen not to go to an Ivy League College or anything like that. No, that, my friend, is a petty problem. My brother has recently been charged with a number of misdemeanors, as well as a few felonies. He lives his life by my uncles, and they all are big time drug dealers and shit like that. He looks up to them so much, I wish he could see that they are not living off thier drug money, nope they are living off a trust check that they recieve every month for a couple grand. And if you really want that trust check Casey, would it really be worth losing your parents. They only recieve the trust check because both of thier parents died when they were very young and left a $12 million dollar piece of a mountain to them.
I AM SORRY FOR MY RECENT BEHAVIOR JENNIFER, THANX FOR PUTTING UP WITH MY SHIT, I HOPE WE CAN  MAKE IT THROUGH THESE TIMES.
Well anyway, at about 3:30 this afternoon my brother told my parents to fuck themselves and he ran away. Anyway after a couple hours where do you think he ended up? 
At my uncles house, of course. 
Well my uncle Mike, I guess got Casey in the trunk of his Acura Legend to take him home. But after a minute of consideration he decided to bring him out to talk to him, but Casey popped outta the trunk and took off like a bat out of hell. I guess.
And he called my parents at about 9:00 pm and once again told them to fuck off, and that they fucked up this time, because he is never coming home. Well as a brother, I really want him to see the light and come home, the grass is much greener on this side of the fence Casey. I will do anything to have him realize it and come home. 
But there still inlies one problem, my pops is extremely bull headed just like my little brother, and so he told us the we are not allowed to let my little brother in this house for at least a month. My little 16 year old brother is on his own for a fucking month, and he only left with $20 in his pocket, and I am sure that he smoked/snorted that all away early tonight.
I can't stop thinking of my brother out there on his own smoking himself retarded. He really has no future, unless he wants to be making license plates in the local penitentiary.
Without Jennifer I do not know where I would be. In all honesty, I might be out there with him, living THAT life that I escaped a couple years ago. I finally realized that the grass IS TRULY a nice shade of green over here, I don't want to go back to that depressing mindless existence that I used to call my life. I like being somewhat of a success with my work, my school, family life, and most important....my girl.
Well I want to get some sleep, today was one big headache, I mean I had a ton of fun with Jennifer, but my family is going down in flames, and I can't help but be slowly tossed of the edge myself.
Goodnight LJ Land-

"event","I hate the cold, I like the snow, but hate the fucking depressing weather that always comes with it. I am just not ready for the winter season, I realized that this afternoon, in Sugarhouse. 
I promised my friend Josh that I would be at his house at 10:00 am to work on recording some new songs. I didn't roll out of bed until 12:15 pm. I felt really bad about going back on my word, so I quickly prepared myself for the coming day, before landing at his place I needed to shower, gather my thoughts, and eat a bowl of fruity pebbles. Once at his house, we were both really tired so we layed in his room listening to Reel Big Fish (thanx Jenn) and threw the frisbee, as well as a few songs we had been working on. Jenn is gonna be proud of me, one of these songs that I have been writing sounds alot like Ani Difranco. I like it because the chorus is all chopped and twangy, like Ani's guitar style, but then the next riff it leads in to is all slow and melodic. But to properly play the two together and call them one song is damn near impossible, because the riffs are just so different, so we are in serious need of a nice transfer from riff to riff. So beautiful that noone would notice the difference. Well until I become a guitar master I think we are fucked. 
       Well after an hour of frisbee tossing (god you would've thought that we were both high). We decided to collect some money, so I took him to Pibb's Xchange down in Sugarhouse, well we each had a full garbage bag of clothes to pawn, we put our sacks up on the table. And after she checked all of our clothes, the bitch decides that she can only accept three of my shirts, nothing else. We got a measly $10.00 , whoop-a-dee-doo. It was about this time that my stomach called in an order for a nice plate of Mexican food, and all the damn thing had to do was convince my brain, and we were off to Rose Park, the home to the best Mexican food in the valley. We ate at the Taqueria de el rey de oros (god knows what that means.) But anyway we walk in, we (of course) are the only white kids in the joint, and I decided to make my mark as a proud albino son of a bitch, so I strut up to the jukebox and play the whitest song that they got, ""Pretty fly for a white guy"" by the Offspring, I don't think that they enjoyed it, because I saw a guy sending his son up with money to change the CD after my song, but I beat him to it, and put in $2.00 of songs including more Offspring, Aerosmith, and Social Distortion. Well Josh and I each ate 5 mini tacos, and bolted before we got jumped or shot or something, we went back to Josh's house (after the uneventful Media Play.) 
    Anyway umm guess what I have not talked to Jenn at all today. She was busy with her friend Liz, but I am going to meet her after work. Hopefully she has not made plans, I will be umm meeting her at work at 9:15 so hopefully she greets me with open arms.

Jennifer called me straight outta bed after an hour of GOOD sleep. So I already wanted to hit the pillow. But once I met up with her, and her sidekick Liz. I quickly realized that ""I ain't fucking tired no more"" So I was set for a nice long night.......supposedly.
But after we watched Urban Legends and headed for bed, sleep was inevitably closing in behind me, I couldn't do anything but let it takeover. I hopped into the quaint single bed, next to Jennifer. I was having trouble staying balanced on top of the bed, there was no way that I was gonna give into the temptations of sleep, like I do all other nights, I was gonna be a fucking nightowl tonight. But nope, it wasn't meant to be, right when I gained my balance inside the bed, and got some piece of comfort, I was gone. Damnit, what in the fuck is wrong with me. I am laying next to a stunningly beautiful girl, and I can't even stay awake long enough to watch HER pretty eyes close for the night. I do remember waking up a few times during the night, and just watching Jennifer sleep, god she looks so innocent and cute while she sleeps. 
       After that wonderful night of speechless rest, we needed replenishment. And so I led the girls to my favorite little Denny's wannabee resturuant....Village Inn. It was Fuckin' packed, we actually had to wait 10 minutes to be seated at a damn eat-em'-up joint. That has never happened to me before. And I am a damn regular at Dee's, Denny's, or the Village Inn. Well I decided that today was Sunday, and I try to eat my shittiest food on Sunday, so I ate a bacon omelette, and 3 pancakes. Jennifer had a large belgian waffle.

CANDY I HAD TO BUY TO KEEP FRIENDS OCCUPIED WHILE WAITING IN LINE FOR TICKETS.....................$5.00
KORN CONCERT TICKET.............$30.75
ONE KICKASS NIGHT OUT WITH GUYS......PRICELESS

Fuck yeah, I got my general admission ticket for Korn in the Pop Sucks tour this November 21st. I am fucking tickled. And after Casey, Jake and I bought our GA tickets, the damn floor was sold out. Looks like there will plenty of oppurtunities for an ass  kicking this november. But we got numbers, there is three of us, and there is not a person, in the world, that I would not stand up to and fight if he fucked with either Casey or Jake. We are gonna go crazy and hopefully not get too bloody, or beaten silly during the concert. If so ,hell, it's all in fun and games, nothing a little time won't heal. This will just about chalk up as the craziest show that I have ever been to. I mean I have seen Slipknot, and Mudvayne in a crowd of 60,000 people in Southern California, but other than that, this tops the list. Casey is actually scared to get into the mosh pit, he better jump in and stay in with me, or else he will get an asswhooping from one of his own. 
      Today with exciting, I rolled outta bed at 8:30, and picked Casey, and Jake up at 9:30, we ran to Smiths to buy Korn concert tickets, fun shit. But they didn't go on sale until 11:00 am, the time got changed from the previous 10:00 am. Fucked up huh? I coulda slept for an extra hour. Well dumb and dumber decided that they wanted to go to Starbucks for a carmel frappicino, nice choice. We cruised down, and got our caffiene fix for the day. And after that we headed back to Smiths. Casey was trying to get with some 16 year old girl that was walking down the juice aisle. Horny little bastard. He said ""if shes old enough to pee, she's old enough for me"". Sick. But anyway, we bought our three tickets at 11:00 am and sure enough we got the last GA tickets availible. The guys behind us were pretty pissed, but we got what we came for. I drove the guys home, and on the way to Caseys house Jennifer calls and asks if I could chil with her. And that made my day. So after I drove Casey home, I cruised over to Jennifers house. And she looked really sexy, she was wearing a white long sleeve shirt with a B/W star on it, and she was wearing somewhat dark lipstick.  
DARK LIPSTICK TURNS ME ON....
And so we ran out to Quiznos to see how my little bro Casey was doing on his second day of the job, I really hope that he is happy there. He needs to find someplace that he likes, for me it is not too hard, I take what I can get. But he seems to ahve a problem with finding a suitable working environment. If he can jsut go to school regularly, and work a little, it would take so much stress off my mom while she goes through her cancer treatments, and her blood clot operations. He needs to stop FUCKING with her emotions. She brought him into this world. He shoudln't be the one helping her out, by causing so much stress, he should be bending over backwards to do everything that he can do for her. Cause as little as he want to admit it, this stuff my mom is going through, is severely life threatening, and I am afraid he wont realize it until it is too late.
Well NEW SUBJECT, I hate talking about that whole ordeal. 
After Quiznos(we didn't eat) Jenn suggested we eat at The Bagelry
Sounded good to me, so off we were, and it was actually suprisingly good, I woud've chosen that over Einstiens or Quiznos anyday. We went back to Jenns house and laid in her bed. It was very relaxing listening to the Alkaline Trio, and chilling in her bed. And then before I knew it, she had to get ready for her first day of work. I wish we didn't work tonight. I really think that Jenn and I just click. She is just so fun to be around. But why has noone else picked up on her yet, why am I not sorrounded by competition, to me she is an extremely desirable girl. She just has so much that other girls don't. Like for one, .......................a PERSONALITY. And a good one to boot.
Oh well, I am supposed to go and chill with her after work tonight so we'll see what happens. LATERS......."

Just kidding I am talking to Jennifer right now on AOL instant messenger, and I am gonna call it quits in a little bit. I need my beauty sleep for sure. My best friend, and girlfriend,....Jennifer got a job, she works at the jewel counter at Meier and Frank. I am happy for her, I really am, happy and proud of her. I just hope that I can still have time with her. I am about at the peak of my Jennifer addiction, all I need is to be told that I can't see her. That would kill me. I need to have my fix of Jennifer like at least 4 times a week or all hell will break loose.
I really like that girl....alot. And she totally knows it too, I can't help but want to be with her, at all times. She's great. I hope that I can see her tommorow, she starts her new job tommorow, and we have like a one hour block to see eachother. I would enjoy that. But if not, I am taking her out on sunday. We are gonna go out for a night on the town. It'll be great.
    JOSH AND I REFORMED INTO OUR OLD TWO PERSON BAND, WE NEED A:
*VOCALIST
*ANOTHER GUITARIST
*BASSIST
SO BASICALLY WE NEED A WHOLE FUCKING BAND.
PLEASE SOMEONE HELP US MAKE MUSIC...........
I am really excited to pick up the pen again and start writing music, as well as lyrics (I can have Jennifer help me with the lyrics, she is deep like that.) Hell she can play the piano in a few songs too.
That's be rad if she really would. To be playing next to my girlfriend in a song would be too much for me too handle. The only problem is I probably couldn't concentrate too well in the jam sessions, if Jennifer is there to distract me.
JOSH WANTS JENNIFERS SISTER....FUNNY SHIT HUH?
well tommorow is another day, hopefully it kicks ass, and i get tipped good chunks at work, I only made $40 cash tonight. But that is enough to buy my Korn ticket and that is enough for me. Good Night all."

I am officially addicted to the damn net. On my way home from the mall this afternoon, I was passing by Whitmore Library, and I had to stop, just for the sole purpose of the internet. Trust me I don't come to the Library for books, the world of literature is a whole new world to me, and I was formally introduced to a good book by Jennifer. She has me reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower. And I am very impressed, it is one book that actually changes my emotions, it is an awesome book, today while I was at the gym cycling I read another 60 pages of it. Which leaves me about 20 pages til the end of the book. Usually at this point I am excited to finish the book, and get it the fuck outta my way, but this one is different, I don't want to forget about Charlie, and his strange but interesting life. I probably wont pick up the book again until Jenn reminds me that she nneds the book back. It is awesome but I just don't want to finish it.
      Yesterday was stimulating. Jenn and I kicked it a bit at her house, which is always fun. And then we hopped in the Legend, picked up Lizzie McGuire and we were southward bound. We were going to a concert in Provo/Orem. Those cities seem to blend together, but anyways Jenn picked the resturuant tonight, we went to The Brick Oven in Provo. It was way good, even though I didn't eat much. After we were all good and stuffed we were off to the show. We got there and stood in line for a few minutes. Jenn was cold. Sad. Anyways we got in there after the damn MALE security gaurd groped my package. He honestly grabbed it, I should've fucking cried rape. Well our seats werent the best but they could've been worse. The show was an eyeopener for me. I realized there is good music out there besides my standard hard rock. The set list included:
Something Corporate (fucking amazing, charlie brown band)
Further Seems Forever (not what I had hoped)
Finch (Lowered expectaions but still really good)
New Found Glory (Really good even though I only knew one song)
When all is considered I think that Something Corporate took the cake tonight. They were awesome, the fucking male singer/pianist practically turned me on. He was very talented, and I really want to be able to play the piano like that. Jennifer is going to teach me how to play the piano. That'll be fun. Well tonight Jennaroo, Liz, Jake and I are gonna go and kick it at Wiseguys, our show starts at 8:00 pm, so after we'll run for dessert. Good stuff. Well G/G"

Today was just as fun,
I hope it only gets better from here
That could be my Christmas present from everyone.
Make my life continue to get better.

Yesterday Jennifer and I went and saw a really awesome movie, I think it was called the Rules of Attraction. It was with that Fucking Dawsons Creek Guy. I though of him as a complete little bitch until I saw this movie. His character is so Fucking hardcore, I used to totally look up to guys like him. Guys that treat women like shit just because they can. Guys that use people only to get ahead in life. But then I fucking matured a little, and I am very pleased to report that I am no longer the little shit that I once was. My career goal in mind (honestly) used to be a drug dealer, an importer of cocaine from Columbia. One fucking good run, and I would be set for life. But now, I would never ever risked getting locked up, getting ripped out of my home, hopefully filled with a loving family by then. Not even for millions of dollars would I risk any of that shit. I may have grown up a little too soon. But I do know whats good for me. That my friends, is why I quit smoking weed, my family has a history of extreme drug addiction, and well if I jump back into the circle of drugs, and the life that goes along with it. A month or two down the road, and I will be slanging weed, or dealing acid or booming shrooms. And I don't need any of that to distract me from what is really important to me. Right now, the majority of my importance goes out to one special little girl. God I have totally fallen for her. And after her, comes success. I will succeed in life, and it will feel great because I am constantly surrounded by those underachievers who have never succeeded in life. I will be the first in my family (ie: uncles, aunts, cousins) to ever go to college. And I am gonna fucking graduate no matter how damn long it takes me. I will succeed in life............."

 Not that I am happy, or sad in any way. I am somewhere in between, you know that feeling you get when you are about to get called on to speak in front of class. I have that feeling right now. I am stressed, and anxious to let whatever needs to pass, fly right by me. I feel that something HUGE is about to happen in my life, and even if I know about it, I can't do a damn thing to better my situation. I really hope that my life changes for the better if anything, not worse. There are a few things in my life that can go terribly wrong, and I don't need anything like that to happen to me. I don't NEED a better life at all, in fact I can't ask for one. The only thing I do need right now is money, but with an abundant amount of cash, comes the high maintenance, snobby bitch attitude. So FUCK the money. I don't need any of it. All I need is my family, and my girl. Speaking of my girl, something is different with this one, not BAD different, just different. She is not like my previous girlfriends. She doesn't smother me with affection half as much as any of them used to. She seems like she could forget about me at the drop of a hat. But that's good, it keeps me on my toes, which promises for a good (hopefully long, and happy) relationship. My Ex's kind've let me hold all the cards in the relationship, but this new relationship seems like more if a team effort. I am really happy with my situation right now. I can't complain when I have got a loving family, a nice steady job, and a girl that really seems to care about me.
      Today I went out to lunch with Jake, we went to Cafe Silvestre, it is a mexican resturaunt like La Puente. Good Shit. Well after I ate, Jake and I got to talking, and we decided a few things:
*We need to get drunk as fuck before the Korn concert this november
*We need to throw another kegger around the holidays
*We need to chill a little this halloween night
*I need to find a girlfriend for his sorry ass and
*Jenn, I, Jake and his mystery girl, are gonna go to Disneyland around February next year.
Well that about concludes my talking of my whack ass friend Jake.
After we got to his house, I hopped in the Legend, and drove to Jennifers house,(listening to Smashing Pumpkins the entire way). Her parents got home last night, her mom looks really tan, I don't know if it is because of the cruise though, because she is always really tan. Well Jenn and I went to a car shop to see if her oil pan was cracked and leaking in her Camry, it turns out that it was neither of those. That got me thinking that maybe it was her engine coolant container that she cracked, because the stuff left on her driveway didn't have much of a resemblance to engine oil. But what the fuck do I know about cars. Jenn and I ran to a gas station just because she didn't want to retreat to her home quite yet. That girl is really too much, she is just so funny.
While inside the Chevron Jennifer secretly stole my wallet so that she could pay for our goodies, but I noticed in time to get it back from inside her shirt to pay for the stuff. Then we went back to her house, and did what we do best........chill. We layed on the floor with our feet on the couch and talked philosophy. She talked smarts while I tickled her. God I am in love with her tickle laugh. I can't get enough of it. I want to box it up, and crack the box whenever I feel sad, or just need a quick pick-me-up. Sad day though cause I had to go to work. I got to work and time flew, and I was out of there by umm 10:50pm with $48.00 in my pocket. I kind've wanted to chill with Jenn tonight. But I guess I will see her another day."

"event","These last few days have been really great, 
Jennifers parents went on a cruise, so we've been chilling alot at her place. First of all on on October 8th, well I went in to work that night, but they really didn't need me. And I didn't want to sit around and work for fucking shells and beads all day. I like the cold hard cash. But I wasn't gonna get any that night, so I decided to give myself the night off.
I cruised on home and called my favorite girl. And I was planning on meeting at her house a little later that night. Upon entry to her dormicile, I found out that she was abit hungry, and she decided that we should go out to eat at Geckos Mexican Resturuant. The food was great, and I actually ate alot that night, I finished a whole chicken burrito grande. It was really good, and Jenn, my usual eating buddy, barely touched her food. Sad. She got a cheese quesadilla, but she only ate three slices of it. After that we retired to what would become quite the popular hangout later that night. We cruised back to her house, and just chilled in her room, for an hour or so. We were listening to Smashing Pumpkins, and she was reading me some of her journal entries from 2001, it was really nice, I got to learn alot about her. Well I left her bedroom, to get a Mountain Dew, and the living room was filled with damn meathead jocks. Looks like Michelle (Jenns little Sister) was throwing quite the party, but I didn't see any booze. So after I turned up with no beer, I decided to go back and chill with Jennavive, we continued to hang out in her room for another hour or so, and I left the room again, and shit the house was cleared, everyone had left. I was hoping for like 3-4 kegs, and like a mini bar. But I guess they went to chill somewhere else. Sad again. I wanted to get wet, so we umm hopped in her hot tub, and it was great, it was about 2:30 am, and we just chilled in it, I love her hot tub, I honestly do, I want that thing in my room. It is like drinking a half gallon of cough medicine, it knocks you out. So once we were damn good and tired (or so I thought), we decided to go to bed. We crawled into bed at like 3:00 but we didn't hit the sack until a little before 5:00 am. It was then, in bed that night, that I decided that I wanted to miss school the next day. Let's see 
1. Stay in bed, and sleep in, next to a beautiful girl
          or
2. Go to school, and think about that same beautiful girl
hmmm that's a tough one. So we slept in till' about 10:30. And we took turns with the showers. We had a big day in front of us. We were gonna go and hang out in Park City all day, and then go to a (kind've) punk show later that night. But to fully get prepped for the day, we needed some nutrition so we went to the best damn breakfast resturuant this side of anywhere, Carls cafe. Jenn had a large helping of french toast, and I had a turkey and swiss cheese sandwich. After tat colon burster on a plate we picked up Liz. It was about 2:00 in the afternoon when we hit the hills in search of that wonderful place known as Park City, and I do men IN SEARCH of, cause we couldn't find the damn thing. I fucking passed the exit, So after we found our way back to the city. We started to walk around, and look in various snowboard, home decorating, and fashion stores. Damn that city is expensive. They had these pair of pants in one store that were on sale for $150.00, originally marked down from god knows what, and then we saw a painting that sells for $39,000. Jesus, I probably wont be able to afford lunch for these two girls. We meandered along some more, and just kicked it in the big PC. We went into this little cybercafe, and got some coffee, and I taught Liz how to play some card games like WAR, and Blackjack. Liz actually appeared to be having fun today. Good times. Once we were good, and hungry, we went to the Loco Lizard, and had some more good mexican food. But it was about time that we had better leave for our show. After getting all of our shit together, we left for the show it was downtown in a place called the Junction. We found it, we camped out on a little couch near the back of the room. The band 
(We Three Kings) was pretty good, they had a nice sound to them, but the set was over after like 6 songs, so after proving to Liz that we wanted her around a little bit longer, we went and rented some videos from Blockbuster. We got The Exorcist, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. We went back to the party palace, and watched The Exorcist. It wasn't all it was cracked up to be. That movie was wrong in so many ways. Liz has to work tommorow, so I ran her home, and Jenn and I came back to her place, and showered, and then got into bed. Jennifer was extremely somber last night in bed. She was just really quiet, I felt bad, I wanted to o something, so I figured that letting her get some rest was all I could do. And I attempted to do just that, I layed on the opposite side of the bed, and she apparently couldn't sleep. After I zonked out, she said that she went out and watched a little T.V. Late night T.V. is good for the soul. For sure, it is fucked up, it is all like QVC or sexual enhancing advertisements. This entry is fucking boring, it it just the damn facts, no commentary on my part. Just cold hard facts. Well lets keep em coming then. Jenn was awake before me today, and her messing around with the dryer woke me up. Good stuff though, cause today was my last long day with Jenny for awhile so I want to spend as much of it as I can awake, and with her. Well tonight we are planning on trying to hook up my friend Ed with Liz, we'll see how that goes though. Well G/G laters."

"event","I am here sitting next to my homie Jenn in the Sandy Library. Why you ask? cause my damn internet is down, and for some reason Jenn (the net addict) just signed off. So that means my journal will be cut short today....real short. Jenn looks cute but bored, she is drawing something on a piece of paper in the cubicle next to mine. Oh, she just signed back on, that means that I can stay on the net. Well alright a couple days ago, (october 6th) was my little sisters 14th birthday, but I can't remember anything about the day, I do remember that Jennifer came over, and we kicked it. But other than that, I am lost, I am getting too old for this stuff. So I will talk about today, today was a long ass day, I have been awake for about 13 hours so far, but I still have about 6 to go. My dad pulled me outta bed, he said that his workers all called in sick, so I had to go washwindows with him, we worked on three jobs from 8:00 am to about 2:00 pm, and it was worth it though, he has work for me later in the week, and he fronted me $80.00 dollars. After that I called Jenn (big supprise there) and Jenn, Liz and I went out to Pib's Xchange, and I just wasn't in the shopping mood. So I didn't get any clothes. Sad Day. Well after that we went to Cup A Joe, and we drank some (I drank some) frozen mocha. Oh, the fucking mayor, decided to impound a new law where you have to backup when parking downtown, I saw the article about the law on the news later , and it is supposed to make more room for other cars, but Fuck what when we back up do our cars magically shrink or something, I don't think so. How in the hell is there more room, for other cars. And on top of all the stupidity, you need to STOP in traffic to backup your damn vehicle. Well shit if that ain't a saftey risk I dunno what is. Well I am getting pretty hungry so I am gonna take mi chica favorito por como por ellas estomogo. 
Comprende? Adios Pendego.

"event","Last night I made a small attempt to throw a little ""social get together/party"". But it didn't all pan out, all my friends have fucking jobs, so now I am on their god damn waiting lists for a little piece of their time. I think it was the lack of alcohol that made them think twice about wasting their precious thursday night with me. Believe me, the night was great, I had a wonderful time, but it wasn't a crazy party. No naked people, no hardcore drugs going on. Just me and 3 of my good friends. And that was probably best, because one of the three people was my girlfriend. And nothing disgusts a girl like a ""male-chauvinist porno party."" Well let me start at the beggining.........I took Jennifer out to dinner at the LoneStar Taqueria, it is damn good home cooked mexican food,.....my favorite. We had some cheese quesadilas and I had a chicken tamale. After that we hopped in the Legend and went to pick up Lizzie Mcguire, and she wanted to go out to eat at Morelias, but I had to be at my uncles house before he left, he left about 20 minutes from then. So I dropped Liz and Jenn off to Jenn's house, Jenn decided to take Liz out to dinner alone in the Camry. So we split, I cruised on up to Mikeys. Well I made a few booze retreival calls on the way up, no luck. I got to Mikeys and just walked in, he was taking the biggest bong hit, as I was walking in. It was so funny because then he would put his lips to his dobermans lips and blow all of the smoke inside the dogs mouth, that dog was high before Mike even left the house. He had a few of his cooler friends over, he had Ben, Kelly, and Jessie over. Well anyway they all left to go drunken bowling. And I had the house to myself,...sad. But not for long, cause Jennavive called and she was on her way, I ran downstairs and shot a quick game of pool,....by myself. After that I ran outside and smoked a quick cherry cigar on the front steps. And about that time, the girls showed up. They took the tour and I started to mix drinks for Liz, Jenn made the smart choice of not drinking. Thats kinda where I stood, hard alcohol sounded so gross to me, especially whiskey, so I didn't drink any all night. I just had a few beers, and 3 or 4 cigars. Liz got really drunk after about 7 or 8 shots of whiskey and everclear. She was totally trippin all over herself. I darted out to the car, and grabbed my disposable camera, we got some pretty funny ass pictures of Liz, just laughing and rolling on the dirty, dog hair infested floors. Overall this night was going pretty well, I know Liz was having fun, and Jenn seemed to be having fun watching her best friend. About 11:00pm Matt decided to show up, he brought like 7 or 8 piss beers, like Natural Light, and Keystone. We all just sat around watching The Royal Tenenbaums and drinking. But then my uncle showed up, and what little party we had going in the first place sorta died. Liz got all somber, and tired. She wanted to leave, so Jenn and her hit the road at about 12:30, And after they left, the party really died, we went downstairs to shoot some pool. My uncle and all his friends were still trading off bong hits, I think Matt wanted to hit it bad. But it got really stupid, so Matt and I actually left at about 1:45. I think I am gonna go and develop those pictures today."

      Why you ask, because I just found out that I do not work tonight, and that means one of two things. Either I can hang out with the guys, or with my favorite girl, Jennifer. Right now my vote clearly stands with the second. I really love to spend time with Jenn. It's just that sometimes I feel that I am moving in on her life way too fast. She denies it all over the place, but I can't help but worry, ""Is this gonna end as fast as it started?"". Cause in what little experience I have, I have found out that the faster you move in with a girl, the faster you are booted out of her life. But somehow, Jenn really seems different, she is not like other girls, that need to be entertained with exciting, expensive dates every night, Nope, I've got myself a keeper. She always says that she is more concerned with the company over what they are doing. And I am all over that, that is really so cool to me. Because the High School I just graduated from was filled with nothing my high maintenance, materialistic bitches, so to me, Jennifer is a very pleasant , and welcome surprise. After reading through what I have just wrote, I have decided to give Jenn a call, I would like to hang out with her tonight. I dunno what it is about this girl, but I think even with us hanging out as much as we do, this wonderful girl and I can keep it real for some time to come. Or at least that is what I am hoping. Only time will tell.

"event","Today was not a fun day-
I did get to sleep in til about 1:00 pm though, hell that was the damn highlight of my day (sleeping in from the night before). Well anyways I woke up and decided to help my mom out a a bit around the house, she got back from the hospital yesterday. She has ovarian cancer, but that was not the reason she was in the hospital this time. Nope, last week while she was at her weekly chemotherapy treatment they found blood clots in her lungs, which means that they already passed through her heart. Thank God. If one clot would've burst anywhere near her heart she would not be tucked into a nice warm bed with my dad right now. She would've died instantly. God that stresses me out so much. And that stress does not help me at all with my new ""relationship"" (I dunno what's going on between us). I can't concentrate long enough to really show Jenn that I enjoy her company, I really do need to thank that wonderful girl, she helps me through this so much, when I am with her, I find myself almost worry free, which is nice for a change. Without Jenn, this weight on my shoulders would've really eaten away at me alot more than it has. Well I decided to help her by cleaning the bathroom, it is so disgusting, that bathroom really needs a full time staff of like 10 people just to stay ""presentable"" let alone ""nice looking"". After cleaning the house, I uhh helped clean the kitchen, vacuum the house, and take out the garbages. Well about that time (3:00pm) Casey calls, and so I cruise up there and we drive down to Media Play, and he looks at CD's while I play one of their nice acoustic guitars they have down there. 
I WANT TO PLAY THE GUITAR AGAIN.
We leave and he asks me about my life, girls in general. And I tell him about the first girl that pops into my mind........Jennifer. And he asks me her age. I make the mistake of informing Casey that she is 19 (legal smoking age), he goes nuts, see he just ran out of his stuff. So he asks me to have her buy stuff, and I am like ""No Casey, maybe tommorrow when I see her but not today, that girl needs a break from my presence."" And after another couple blocks of his bitching I flip a bitch and head towards Jenns house. We get there and her dad tells us that she just stepped into the shower. So we leave. Now Casey and I do what we like to do best.........shoot pool. We run up to my uncles house, and jump in on some doubles, with him and his friend Ian. It all seemed fair until we got rocked. Casey and I used to be good, but I guess Mike and Ian really kicked our asses. Well Casey bothers me some more about the whole Jenn thing so I call her and she tells me to come down. We go on down, and get the Kodiak chewing tobacco at 7-11 no problem. Now Jenn tells me that she has to hangout with her friend Liz in about 20 minutes, so I run her home (mistake 1: I just used the girl that I really like). STUPID CODY. And then since I felt bad about using her, I ask her to hang out with Casey and I tonight, and to bring Liz along. (Mistake 2: I am trying to get her and Liz to hang out more with out me. But I just fucking contradicted myself.) Well that just about sums up all of the mistakes made today, now the rest of the day gets really boring. Casey takes my car to his house, and changes the oil while I finished some homework. What a nice kid, I gave him an extra bottle of Polo Sport for changing it. Then we were back out on the streets in the Legend at about 8:30 pm. We just drove around a smoked a few cigars that Jenn bought me. We retired to his place where we made a few calls. No luck. He made us a few Long Island Iced Teas. Those Jack me up. I only had two in the span of twenty minutes and I was shitty. Two long islands contain six shots of various alcohols. I was just laughing. But after I became sober, it was back to this boring day. So I told Casey to get some sleep, and I came home to finish homework, I did some while listening to a little Unwritten Law. I am tired now, and the sooner I close my eyes, the sooner I can open my eyes to tommorrow, and who knows maybe tommorrow will be a good, happy sunny day. I really hope so, because I have a date with Jenny. Good Night All."

"event","Yesterday was awesome,
Jenn, Liz, Matt and I went and saw the X96 Big Ass show, but I didn't see a ton of big asses, it did kick ass however, so it is now the X96 Kick Ass show in my book. Well the set list included bands like Audiovent, Chevelle, Reel Big Fish, Goldfinger, Our Lady Peace, and The Start. For some reason that is all I can remember, I dunno my brain can't fucking work, I didn't get to sleep til about 3:30, and I had to wake up @ 7:30 cause I work at 9:00 for like 8 hours. Well yeah the show lasted from 12:00 pm to about 6:00 pm, not bad at all for $20.50. But after the shwo I dropped the girls off to shower and prep for the remainder of the night, I mean the girls smelled fucking pretty, but I know that I could of definitley used a nice shower, so I gave them about 2 hours to shower and get some much needed sleep, and then I went and picked them up. The girls were starving, so we took them to thier favorite mexican resturuant Morelias. After that we jsut kind've chilled for a long ass time, and became utterly bored, so I was throwing out any idea, we even dorve to my old work at the Cottonwood Country Club, god knows why, but it killed almost a half an hour. But then Liz said she wasn't feeling well so we took her home, and I feel bad because she does that alot, and I really feel bad, that she doesn't hang out with her best friend(Jenn) as much as they used to, or so it seems. And the only thing I can really do to rectify the situation would be seriously slow down with Jenn, but honestly, I don't want to at all, this is the best time I have had in a long time, and I don't just want to walk out on it. But if I am asked to, by either Jenn or Lizzie Mcguire, then I think I can do it. Well only time wil tell what goes on between Jenn and I. But I am totally starting to get the notion that Liz is starting to really get sick of me chilling with her best friend 3-4 days a week. If I could have one wish on the situation, besides having Jenn and I stay happy for a long time to come, it would definitely be to have Liz find herself a little Mr. Right, that would be the best thing that could happen to her, .......I think. But I have only know these girls for a few weeks, so I dunno how much I really know them. Well then after dropping Liz off, Jenn bought me some Swisher Sweets cigars, (god bless her). And then we went up to Matts house and smoked, it was great, but I think Matt felt like the third wheel, so after that he wanted to go home, so dropped him off. Then Rob (drunk as hell) called us and told us to come to the party, and so we did, we went up to his damn sausagefest, it was like 20 guys and like 3 girls. But it was all good, alot of my close friends were piss drunk, so it was funny, but it would've quickly turned annoying so Jennifer and I skated out of there no more than 5 minutes after we made our debut appearance. But there really was no point to it, I mean they aren't gonna remember that we came up. So Jenn and I hit the road, it was off to her house, if not to get her into bed, it was to chill with my favorite girl, so she invited me in, and we watched some Donnie Darko,  I still didn't see the whole thing cause I guess I fell asleep with Jenn, which apparently happens alot. I feel bad, she totally needs to wake me up when that happens. After the movie was over, I left her house at about 2:30 but that whole day was great, I really hope that everyone else had fun, especially Jennavive. Well I am late for work so laters."

"event","Last night was great, Jenn and I just chilled for like 3 hours at her house, we just hung out and watched T.V. After that we ran out to Sugarhouse to eat at Fats Grill, upon entry we quickly realized that you had to be 21. Jenn made a good point, she said that it would be alot more effective if they called it Fats Tavern, or Fats Bar. But no, they have to fuck with our minds, put the thought of good food, in our heads and then deny due to our damn age. But Jenn and I do have a set date there in three years. So it's all good, and it was all good, cause I made the decision (suprise, suprise) to run to the nearest Olive Garden, and I was actually very happy to go there, because Jenn just opened up to me with all of her Olive Garden stories, and if there is one thing I love to do with that girl, it is listen to her talk. She is just so damn cute when she gets into her stories, especially when she talks about or sings along to Ani Difranco. Well after all of that good food (that I didn't eat) we ran back to my house and then her house to pick up jackets, cause it was getting a little cold, and we had plans for the rest of the night, we were initially planning on going to Nightmare on 13th haunted house, but as we pulled over, we saw these two people chilling outside the haunted house, they said that someone closed it during the night. Fucked up huh?, well then we ran to Wheeler Farm to see if the haunted woods were open, wait, wait , wait, first Jennifer took me out to Starbucks, and I had this really good Vanilla bean Frappicino, Jenn had a carmel frappicino. Back to the haunted woods, they weren't there, but people were (old people) so we got out, and walked into the barn to see what all the commotion was about, I don't know what the hell it was, but there were nametags, and markers, and we swiped a couple of those, and after filling those out Jenns new name was Jennavive, and mine was Cody Pants, .....cute. Well we walked around the deserted farm for awhile, I got scared by a monstrous chicken, but we ended up hanging out in the treehouse for a bit, it was great, I really love just laying and talking to her, she makes me feel so comfortable, and accepted, especially only after 2-3 weeks, those weeks have been great. But I feel bad, because I think she still thinks that I am fresh off the rebound, I need to find a way to prove to her, that I was over my ex months ago. Because I do not want Jenn and my relationship to be destroyed due to that little selfish bitch (pardon my French). What I have with Jenn is definitley something new, I think it is just because of the age, because one year can honestly make a huge difference at this age, I just feel much more relaxed, and at-home with Jennavive. After the farm, we ran to blockbuster to rent Donnie Darko (her favorite movie), and she talked me into watching it at my house, it's all good though, cause her chips are stacking up. Next time we chill (that would be tonight) she has to:
1. Pick where we eat w/o any influence from me.
2. Let us watch a movie at her house.
3. Hopefully get into the hot tub.
We just layed down on my retro green couch, and watched the movie. And from what I saw that was a good movie, Jenn left it at my house and told me to watch it again, I think I will before we chill tonight.
Tonight is gonna be awesome, I have my friends Seth, Rob, Tyler and his girlfriend Billy. Jenn has her and Lizzie Mcguire, so that means that Liz gets to play a little Elimidate with Seth, and Rob, I honestly think that she will dig Seth, he called me this morning @ like 9:00 and woke my ass up, I was just laying in bed listening to Finch, and Cypress HIll. But I told him about her, and he was like she's big isn't she, and Rob took over and said yeah she's huge, so Seth think she weighs like 280 lbs. So hopefully he will be really suprised and turned on tonight, cause Liz honestly has a booming body. We'll see, and if I get home early enough I will update about all the good times we are gonna have tonight. If not I'll write tommorow. Laters."

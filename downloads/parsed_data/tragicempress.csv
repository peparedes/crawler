"event","everything is inside out
turn this way
run that way
scattered thoughts
chasing after the beast
just one more bottle
i'll be ok
silence kills
it burns the lining of my stomach
run 
run
i will catch you soon
just one more bottle
i'll be just fine
i am turning blue 
i can hold my breath
i can dance through midnight
just one more bottle
the pain is gone
chase you away
run you out
one night less painfull
one night less hatefull
i found the beast
just one more bottle
just one more
one bottle of beast
and you are gone,
and so am i



peeling through my skin
this scab wont heal
it is my heart
heart that you wasted
my heart that you wasted
you wasted my heart 
 
 

growing inside
inside something that i can not see
your eyes are blank
and you look at me like i am a abused child
you made me this way
you put me in this place
your eyes are so dead now
they dont show a vission 
you will always be alone
because you can never have me
i will always be alone
because i can never have you
you speak to me as if i were a little girl
you made me this way
you pushed me back in time
growing inside
inside something that i can not see
is an abused little girl
with your dead eyes burning her skin
and her heart in her hands
you made her this way
you ripped her heart out of her chest
and now she just sits in her sioled dress
with your dead yeeys burning her skin
and her lifeless heart on the floor
i will always be alone
because now, my eyes are dead too."

I close my eyes and I keep on stalking
my love
my love

no one's aware of the hunger I feel
it's something you or time cannot heal
I need someone to help me rise above

Eternal bliss is something I can show you
spread your arms and let my wings enfold you
my love

In the darkness shades of crimson rapture
the world is ours alone to capture
my love

Come over here and let me tell you something
nothing ever comes of nothing
we pay a price for all our choices made

come along now and take my hand
I'll lead you to a promised land

it may never come again..."

i'm not really complaining, i'm more worrying than anything else.  i dotn know how to make decisions and keep them.  i could be thinking one thing one minute, and then the next my opinions will be totally different...and its not on the small things in my life either. its the decisions that effect my emotions.  the ones that  drive me mad.  

i just think to myself...darling, you'll be ok. 

maybe i'm kidding myself...maybe i'm not.  but i do know that i need to start to believe what i say or i'll never be ok.

i miss how things were a few months ago, at the the start of this year. i miss alot of things.  things seemed so peaceful then.  i was happier.  i didnt need as much as i do now.  i knew what i wanted.  i knew where i wanted to be.  and most of the time i was happy with what my situation was.  but now its so confusing and its not going the way i want it to.  it got all messed up.

(no complaining here)  as soon as we walked in, some old guy comes up to me and says ""i think i'm in love""....my reaction: ""i'm sorry""  then he tried to introduce me to someone...and apologized to brian...and i ran away.  i got hit on the whole way to my seat...it settled down after that thank god. i'm lucky i wore a bra...or it might have been worse...my shirt is cute, i just made it today, but its made weird, and, like now, when i dont wear a bra,  i'm pretty close to showing a little more than i wish to..but sence i'm at home by my self who  cares.

why do i care about him so much!  grr...  i hope he's happy with whatever he's ignoring me for.  becides....i liked the extra chair i had at prom, and the extra $25 i spent on the ticket.  it made a good foot rest?

"event","let me take your hands 
i'm shaking like milk
turning, turning blue all over the windows and the floors
fires outside 
and the sky looks perfect as cats
the two of us together again
its just the same 
a stupid game
but i dont care if you dont
and i dont feel if you dont
and i dont want it if you dont
and i wont say it if you wont say it back
you think youre tired now
well wait untill three
laughing at the christmas lights 
you remember from december
all of this and back again
another girl
another name
stay alive
and stay the same
its a stupid game
stupid game
but i dont care if you dont
and i dont feel if you dont
and i dont want if you dont
and i wont play it if you wont play it back
you cant even see now
so you ask me the way
you wonder if its true because she
through the right door where you lean to the right room
it used to the dust that would lay here when i came here alone
well i dont care if you dont
well i dont feel if you don
well i dont want it if you dont
and i wont play it if you wont play it back
lets go to bed"

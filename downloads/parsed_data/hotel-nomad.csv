but you know i turn to you only when I dont know where else to turn.
i feel as if i cant complain
but all i have are complaints
what do i want?
if i knew that, making logical decisions would be easier
but what about when you dont know what you want
what about when you think you know what you want but you were mistaken
is what you think you want what you really need? or is it what you want?
the min dplays tricks against itsself and once you come to that realization 
it leaves you lost and confused
because you dont know who to trust, you cant even trust yourself anymore
is it in your power to obtain what you want? (or what you think you want)
or do you constantly struggle trying to make the right decisions based on the lies that you tell yourself?
it is a perpetual state of confusion and though it is contained it festers
hope starts to die
are your dreams and aspirations actually your dreams and aspirations? or did you just tell yourself that enough for long enough that it becomes your pseudoreality?
WHATS THE FUCKING ANSWER!?
what do you do
go with the flow? who knows where that will take you

all i know is something isnt right
and for the first time, i dont know what it is
so you search
you try new things
even some things you shouldnt have
but you still feel empty
you wake up excited for something

but that something never comes
you end the day just as sad as it began

i dont want to type anymore
i dont even know who still reads this

im just sick of fighting with myself"

The answer is yes. 

I've felt some feelings recently that I havent felt in a very long time, some good, some bad.
Im not quite sure what to make of them all, and I dont know what has triggered it all. I dont know if this journal and reading back through old entries has brought back some of my past issues that I thought had been dealt with. 

All I know is I feel very fragile and I've never had this much of an urge to get completely wasted.

I never really posted when I was happy

It was comfort
It was a crutch.

"event","I guess im too lazy to make real entries anymore. I guess I will keep posting lyrics that sum up my feelings.

I found that fucking song again. 
This is fucking pitiful.
Im sinking lower and lower everyday
And my bright days grow duller as each day passes.


<i>Its a shame you gotta put on makeup today
I think you look so fine
You look best when you rise

Where did you go
You were here yesterday
Why did you leave?
Why did you leave?
And now I'm stuck here thinking about your face
Why am I so weak?
Why am I so weak?

When you were here we did nothing but fight
But now that you're gone my life has no light
I really want to work this out
But 20 excuses come out of your mouth


I once felt strong
It wouldn't last for long
I wrap my hands around my neck
Kill myself again
Cut my arms with the biggest knife that I can stand

Why waste time
Lifting my head
Keep it down
And save face instead



I hate myself,
more than I ever let on.

I lived too fast and I loved too much and I'll die too young,
but I chose this cup that I drank from.
Knew what I was getting into.
But I couldn't let out what I had to keep in.
I'm ashamed of myself and unspeakable sins,
that I've committed and

I've made mistakes,
but I'll find my way.
There's no explanation for,
the things I've failed at before.
They can't hold my hand.
It just hurts to be a man,
Through the tortures of the damned

If I only had an axe,
I'd sever the ties I've made with the world.
Maybe I can be a stranger,
in a strange place.
If I start now, maybe I can be saved.
If I only had a mask,
I'd cover these bleeding eyes.
They're bloodshot now but they'll be black by dawn.
If I wake up now,
I can be pure again.

<i>Now I realize
I'd give anything I have
To walk a day in my old shoes
Wondering what my first smoke would be like
My first fuck
My next fuck up

Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume its just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility
And say a hard life did this to me</i>"

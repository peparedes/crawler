I need some more time to fix this

Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life

we watched the bands, and tried to get neil to talk to this girl in a pretty dress but he ""wasn't drunk enough"" so i poked him, and i poked lots of other people. then i hugged dave (dgj) when he came off stage and he was really sweaty and i got his sweat on my nose lol :s :)

"event","And I guess tomorrow is another day, another day i'll avoid this. Theres so much that needs to be said, I dont know how to say this, because I dont know how to say much of anything anymore.  I feel as if I am going to burst, but when my time comes to let everything out, it all seems so complex that I can never find the words to say it.  And its always so easy to talk to other people about exactly how you feel, until it comes time to tell the one person that needs to know.  And then I am always second guessing everything I feel like talking about.  I dont know what to do anymore about anything.  Im up and down and back up again every single day, and all I want to figure out is what to do to just be happy.  Nobody can be happy all of the time, but then again, nobody should always be feeling down either.  Im so fucking lazy and so careless with so many things now.  I always feel as if Im making somebody unhappy, and its always hard for me to tell who does and who doesnt want me around.  I'm  so sorry about everything, I just wish i could say No, i don't want this to happen, but yet again, i let myself be 'lead astray'.

I talked a lot about this today at therepy, i as much long for therepy as i dread going, sometimes it scares me because i have to relive things i'd never want to happen again, this which should never have happened, but i have to go through every single little detail and decipher what it mens to me, sometimes i can't move i feel so numb, but i think i'm making progress, even if it is slow.

""fancy a good time sir? four shillings""
LOL
apperntly thats what whore said in those times, anyway, we were in the boys chaning room (in the dance room, but no boys apart from mat broadhurts who is v. gay does dance so no one was in there)and craig kept turning the light off so we screamed in a childish way, to be stupid, but it was cool, apart from vickie was actually scared, lol. Then me and craig went into town and i sprayed burbury brit all over him, now he smells.
Onfriday i went to daves gig at the mill, it was really good, dave was ignoring me tho, but dallas was being really sweet :) rachael went with me, which was suprising because she would never normally go to anywhere like that..
anywhoo:
im getting my hair dyed and cut on thursday, kellie is going to bleach some of it for me so its going to be more blonder,

Last saturday i went to road rage at rock city, it was okay, better than i thourght it would be, i was know as the girl with the sticker on her ass, how the sticker got there im not sure, lol, for some reson everytime i go to city i get really confident and possibly insane. its cool and i love to ""mosh"" and crowd surf, i dont like sitting on random guys shoulders, or ripping my tights. i lost my phone as well. i was so pissed because i have no ones number, so if anyone wants my number (not that u do) just ask. i saw lots  of people i know that ive not seen for ages like Tom, Dom, Gilmore, Jack, Scott, Jonny, Skeletor, and some other guys whos names i forgot.[[sorry]]
I saw Dave [[from Evoke]] too :) hes pretty, so i went and said hi and proberbly made a huuuge fool out of myself.

Wednesday i went to rileys (snooker place) with school (instead of doing p.e cause in yr 11  you can go swimming etc) it was okay except i cant play pool haha.
anyway...
chelsay and emily kept putting the same song on over and over again on the dukebox, so me and laura looked on the rock section and put on:
marilyn manson-dopeshow
slipknot-spit it out
korn-freak on a leash
and everyone in the pub was like ohmigod....blahblahv=blah  
chelsay was being so mean [[as usual]]
And liam, who i sat next to because he HAD no friends, was saying stuff, like ohmigod she is such a total bitch, i wish they'd turn that fucking shit off, to all his new ""popular"" friends. then emily pushed past me and said 'oh im so sorry sarah, i didnt mean to do that, how annoying' and the smiled really fakely. 
  I
  Hate 
    Them.

Work was okay, Amy is obsessed with weed, haha, its all she ever talks about, shes like 'fuck it have a  bucket' and 'when somethings wrong have a bong'
LOL, like thats never been said before. Im really glad shes back though, i dont have to do as much or wash as many peoples hair, so its all good.

I'd love to be scattered to hell with you.
"">There's a beautiful sky tonight and
if you were by my side then we could share it, but you are gone.

So come at me with your moon and burn me in the stars
cause nothing matters anymore.

If I could only see you now for about an hour
maybe just a minute
just to ask
What has she got that I don't have?
Is it her brown eyes?
I know blue eyes get boring but I'll wear dark glasses all the time,
 and, hey if you want me to, I'll take a knife to my own bright eyes.
If I could only see you now for about an hour
maybe just a minute
just to ask
what has she got that I don't have?
Is it her brown eyes?
Well, I'll give you a thousand reasons that tonight 
you should grant me this one wish.
Like the one year of my life that I gave to you and
now you put me through hell.
You break me up.
I should hate you, but I can't replace you in my heart.
 Why am I so pathetic?
I don't get it why you won't return my calls.
Can't you look at me once?
And please if you got a minute,
enjoy this lonely sky with me.
It'll swallow us whole if we only let it.
If I could only see you now for about an hour
maybe just a minute
just to ask
what has she got that I don't have?
Is it her brown eyes?
Well, I'll give a thousand reasons 
that tonight you should grant me this one wish.
Like the one year of my life that I gave to you and
now you put me through hell.
You break me up.
If this sky's going to eat us then I'd like to be digested 
into a million pieces with you. 
I'd love to be scattered to hell with you.
To hell with you.

 There's a tear in my heart where the blood ran out. 
 There's a tear in my heart where the love ran out. I thought
 we worked, pushed toward the same ends,
 I'll never be so quick to trust again. 
 Disenchanted, disgusted, I regret that I trusted. 
 I put my faith. 
 My faith in you, you poisoned me through and through.
 I though we both shared the same injuries. 
 Now I've found it's you who injures me. 
 My heart is cracked from being left out in the cold.
 I know you'll pay for what you've taken - tenfold.

I don&#8217;t mind the unreturned consideration.
I&#8217;ve grown so used to this lonesomeness

At least I tell myself I am relaxed in my loneliness.
I tell my mind to deflect the thoughts my empty heart sends up to it.

Disturbed by the mental flashes of his smiles and his words,
That he sleeps soundly and dreams of others.

It is of no bother to me that while I weep in dark corners gripping my own bloody arms,
pulling my own dirty hair, and bathing in my own salty tears,
that he sits at home, unknowing and unconcerned.

I smile and laugh
God, how I adore my brilliant life.
I shed tears and scream
O, how I carry such disdain for my hideous life. 
And I beg of God to give me an answer,
When will it all be over?

I lay here broken and beaten
Yes,before, I was unfeeling and numb.
Now I am just callous and heartless.

As they are dreams.
I hate you.
I am disgusted by you for being you.
For being perfect in every sense of the word.
I despise you for forcing me to love you&#8230;

The illusion disappears.

Painting a detailed portrait
Of my sanity against the wall.

the darkness doesn&#8217;t

I felt a bit weird and a little light headed for a while.  Then, this morning I felt better.  I'll bet that's kinda like a hunger strike... after a while it isn't so bad.  But, I really missed eating.  I just wanted to chew on something.  And all that sweet juice made me crave some salty munchies.  It's back to beer and munchies tonight.  Yea!

When I got home, his email had been sent to a friend of mine who forwarded it to at least 40 people on her list (me included).  I sent it on to my list.  After talking to the mom the next day, we found out that she only wanted blood from people she knew personally.  She had just meant for my boss to say ""yes"" or ""no"".

Now I have to remain a Republican until the next primary.  AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHH!!!!!  My one protest was that I did not vote for Dubya.

I hope to be able to put pictures in my journal.  My son Ryan said I need to find webspace to store them.  He's working on it for me.  I sure have learned a lot just setting this up.  Though I really resist the idea of a (gasp) journal, this is interesting to me.  Instead of writing my deep dark secrets for no one to see, it feels as if I'm just communicating with a bunch of you at once.  I hope some of my friends will try this.  It could get creative, I think.

Ceevee, ceeeee, and me (sic)--are going on a field trip Saturday to art supply stores and various and sundry other places.  I'm really looking forward to a day with the arteests."

"event","<P>Boy, did I have a <STRONG>weird</STRONG> dream last night.&nbsp; I was with my doggies Joey and Peanut.&nbsp; Somehow I knew that Joey was going to turn fuschia/red color and get mean.&nbsp; Next thing I know, he starts turning colors.&nbsp; He came over to me and got really mean, but I knew it would be OK, because I had seen him or dreamed about him doing it before and it didn't last long.&nbsp; Sure enough, he turned gray and was nice again.&nbsp; How weird is that?&nbsp; Would Freud have fun with it!?!&nbsp; Maybe, it's because I worked on my collage yesterday--it took on a life of it's own and will be titled ""The End is Near"".&nbsp; If I can figure out how to put pictures on this journal, I will do it when finished.</P>
<P>PS&nbsp; Joey is fine today.</P>"

"event","I've waded through the geeky stuff and think that I now have a Live Journal.  I don't understand downloading a client.  I guess I'll have to call Ryan about that.  

Today is a no shower day.  That means I don't go anywhere (except maybe take a walk).  Really looking forward to collage today.  

I'm just typing stuff so I can see if this really works.  Let me know what you think."

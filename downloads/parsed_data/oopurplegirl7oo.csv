"event","THIS TIME I KNOW IT'S FOR REAL 
By: Donna Summer


What would I have to do
to get you to notice me too
do I
stand in line
one of a million
admiring eyes

Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
when I get my hands on you I won't let go
this time I know it's for real

Should I write or call your home
shout it out with a megaphone
radio, TV news
got to find a way
to get my message to you

To say I love you with a neon sign
anything to make you mine

I'm going crazy just to let you know
if I wait too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
that this time I know it's for real

Oh baby
this time, this time, this time, this time
oh baby
this time, this time

Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
when I get my hands on you I won't let go
this time I know it's for real

I'm going crazy just to let you know
if I waited too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
that this time I know it's for real"

"event","So one of my favorite boys ever e-mailed me yesterday... Marco Caban... let me give you some history...

Back like 2 1/2 years ago I met Marco at Ramapo during a snow storm... we became friends... eventually we sorta started seeing each other... nothing real serious though... but eventually he met another girl and kinda dumped me to the curb and it hurt a lot...

Fast forward to about 8 months later where he calls me out of the blue.... he was still with the same girl and I was living with my ex girlfriend at the time... so me and him became friend again.. we used to call each other like 2 times a day.. he was really like my best friend... then one day he just kinda dropped off the face of the earth... again that hurt me a lot...

So now it's like about a year after that and he e-mails me outta the blue... turns out he went into the Navy and is in Italy right now... he said he was sorry for like disappearing on me and said he misses me.... but he had his personal reasons... surprisingly I'm not mad at him... for some reason I've always really cared about this kid.. even through all the bullshit... I'm just happy to hear he's ok... I hope we can continue to keep in touch but the reality is I'm scared to really let him in because he might hurt me again.. but knowing me I will let him in because with him I've always been vulnerable.... I don't know why but that's just how it is..."

"event","Well I haven't writen a real entry in forever so here it goes... 

- First of all Happy Easter to those of you who celebrate it... I don't

- As for my ankle it is doing VERY well and my cast actually comes off on Tuesday.. I'm very excited and I plan on doing LOTS of partying the next couple weeks to make up for lost time

- Work is going really well... they've finally given me like REAL work to do and they even recommended me applying for a better position but I can't because I go to school during that shift... oh well

- Someone at my job actually really likes me.. it's nice to know someone does... but I only like this person as a friend...

- I'm returning to school this Wednesday... I'm scared as hell because I've missed so much

- My Uncle Matty who's also my godfather has had cancer for quite a while.. he's terminal at this point.. my grandma called me on Saturday to tell me he now has stopped eating and driinking so I guess soon he will be gone.. I'm extremely sad but I'm trying to be strong cause I know that's what he would want me to do

- My Aunt has a brain tumor and is having surgery on the 11th to see about he options for removing it and to see exactly what it is.. it's not cancer they know already thank god.... but it's still scary

- on a better not it occured to me today that I have not cut myself in 5 years now!!! Some of you may know that I had a problem with cutting throughout middle school and high school... it's thanks to my Mom that I got better cause not once through it did she ever treat me as being crazy.. she just understood and helped me learn how to deal with things the right way

- so Tuesday when I get my cast off I'm starting a diet.. it will consist of only drinking water and only eating tuna, grilled chicken, and turkey breast.. I will also be taking Trimspa and working out on a daily basis... I'm very excited about this cause once I start losing weight I will start to feel better about myself again.. being single for over a year makes you wonder about things I guess... I love myself but hey maybe losing a few is the key.. who knows... the goal is to lose 40 pounds... but I told my mom 20 so I don't scare her..lol


so in summary I guess with the good always comes bad and as happy as I am right now abouty getting this cast off and having my life back I am sad because my family isn't doing so well... but I do have my mom and she keeps me sane... cause with this whole ankle thing I learned something that my friend Ali tried to tell me long ago... you really can't count on anyone but yourself... and unfortunately I learned I can't... but on a good note I'm not mad... I used to always be so angry about things like this... I felt let down and disappointed but I learned that not everyone is like me I guess and I will accept that... call me jaded if you would like... at least it doesn't hurt anymore..  I hope none of my friends reading this take this worng.. I truly love you all (even Matt) but I can't lie and sit here and say ""Wow this person has been amazing"" but it's understandable because hey we all have stuff goin on and I'm sure people can look at me and say the same thing... no hard feelings... I love you all =)"

All I'm looking for at this point in time is someone I can click with and chill with and be cool with and maybe fool around with... if it porgresses into more fine if not fine.. whatever... I don't think about shit like that

I just never realized finding this would be so difficult... we're now on 1 year and couting... kill me now... please"

"event","I can't fight this feeling any longer. 
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow. 
What started out as friendship, 
Has grown stronger. 
I only wish I had the strength to let it show. 

I tell myself that I can't hold OUT forever. 
I said there is no reason for my fear. 
Cause I feel so secure when we're together. 
You give my life direction, 
You make everything so clear. 

And even as I WANDER, 
I'm keeping you in sight. 
You're a candle in the window, 
On a cold, dark winter's night. 
And I'm getting closer than I ever THOUGHT I MIGHT. 

And I can't fight this feeling anymore. 
I've forgotten what I started fighting for. 
It's time to bring this ship into the shore, 
And throw away the oars, forever. 

Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore. 
I've forgotten what I started fighting for. 
And if I have to crawl upon the floor, 
Come crashing through your door, 
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore. 

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you. 
I've been running round in circles in my mind. 
And it always seems that I'm following you, babe, 
Cause you take me to the places, 
That alone I'd never find. 

And even as I wander, 
I'm keeping you in sight. 
You're a candle in the wind, 
On a cold, dark winter's night. 
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might. 

And I can't fight this feeling anymore. 
I've forgotten what I started fighting for. 
It's time to bring this ship into the shore, 
And throw away the oars, forever. 

Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore. 
I've forgotten what I started fighting for. 
And if I have to crawl upon the floor, 
Come crashing through your door, 
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore.



This song describes EVERYTHING I feel about you"

"event","Well I'm home from surgery and all went well... I must say the nurses and doctors were sooooo good to me... they waited on me hand and foot.... just like I've always wanted... haha... I was scheduled to go in at 2:30 but really didn't get in till like 3:30... the resident doctor who helped my doctor was fucking HOT so that put me in a good.mood... so I woke up at 6:15 in recovery and mad pain but they pumped me full of morphine so it got better... the nurse then told me my Mom had just called and told her to tell me she loves me.. I just thought that was the cutest shit in the world... I was sooo hungry so I made them bring me a turkey sandwich and apple juice.... they were so proud i was able to eat so soon...lol... and as soon as I got out of recovery I peed... so in order to leave they make sure you can eat and pee.. so at that point they were ready to have me leave but i started to hurt again so I took a perkocet so they made me wait another hour... so I just chilled out in the post-op and watched TV and talked on the phone with my Mom and Aunt.. my Aunt kept bitching about how it was getting late and how my uncle was getting tired... so that hurt.. it already had hurt me that when I woke up from the surgery I had nobody there to like hold my hand... so I told my Mom to try to get in touch with Chris Ryan but she couldn't but she did get in youch with my cousin Paul who said he'd be happy to come and get me.. so he came with my Uncle Burton... how funny my gay uncle and gay cousin came...lol... not only am I a fag-hag in my social like but in my family life as well.... the fags love me.. I don't know... I was soooooo happy to see a familiar face... they put me in a great mood... 

so yeah basically the doctor put a pin, some wire, and a screw in my ankle... and the hospital gave me new crutches, some scrubs, and pillows... how cool!

So all in all in went VERY well and I am in great spirits... when I got home Jose even came over to see me... It was nice seeing him.. he's been a different person lately and I like it... he's like the Jose I originally knew and loved.... I always knew that boy was special.. I made him take one of my perkocets and it got him fucked up...lol.... but I think he liked it... 

So today my Aunt is coming over at around 10 and she's bringing me food... and sometime later Chris, Randy, AJ, and Greg are supposed to come by.... we'll see if they really do... but i hope so cause I really like those 4 boys a lot!

Oh and thanks Jenna for calling yesterday... that was so sweet of you... =)"

"event","So I went to the Orthopedist yesterday about my ankle thinking I was just getting a cast when he tells me I have to get surgery so they can put pins in my ankle... so now I'm just like scared and just an emotional mess... I'll be out of work until about March 3rd (I think) and School until March 9th... and after the surgery I'll be in a hard cast and on crutches for a while... the surgery is on Friday .. anyone who cares feel free to come by and keep me company or whatever... I'm no longer gonna ask anyone for help because it's become very clear to me that nobody really cares enough about me to do that... but that's ok because when I'm healed i now know who not to invest time in anymore... I didn't intend on this being some life altering event but that's what has happened unfortunately... I'm not really in the mood to chit chat and stuff because I'm really depressed right now... so I was just throwing this out for just to let everyone know what my deal is... thanks =)"

"event","So last night I attended a sleepover at Chris Ryan's in order to relieve some of the stresses of this past week.. I had like 2 drinks.. definately NOT drunk.. I decided I wanted to go outside and have a cigarette and I missed the step going into his porch and fucking fell and when I fell I heard a snap... but i convinced myself i just sprained the bitch and figured I'd throw some ice on the bitch and wake up in the AM and it would be fine... so in the middle of the night I had to pee 2 times and I couldn't even walk to the bathroom without assistance (thanks so much CJ and Chris!).. so by about 6:30 AM the pain had gotten to be too much to take so I woke Randy up (so sorry babe) and asked him to bring me to the ER so he woke the other boys up and they conferred on what to do... Chris Patrick decided I should go to his Mom's urgent care place because the ER would take really long so I was OK with that so we stopped at the pancake house first (where I hopped in on 1 foot and got stared at) then went.. I waited for about 3 hours total but was told the bitch was broken... they didn't even have crutches there... so they gave me and air cast and told me to call an orthopedist on Monday and make an appointment for ASAP to get my real cast because i couldn't do it today cause my nakle was too swollen... so then I had to run around and borrow some crutches from my aunt and like fill my prescriptions... but my uncle fed me some good ass meatloaf so that made me happy... so I got home and relazied I couldn't even carry my shit in.. so Greg stopped by to bring in my shit (thanks soooooooo much hun)... and now I'm chillen... but anyone who wants to stop by or just call to occupy me would be greatly appreciated... I'm so sad my nice little 3 day weekend is ruined! I soooooo wanted to go to Avalon.. .damn it!"

"event","Well here's a quick re-cap.... so for a few days I lost my voice and my throat was all fucked up so I went to the doctor and it turned out I had bronchitis.. so I got medicine that cost $100!!!!! I was pissed about that shit.... plus this medicine makes me mad fucked up like I'm on drugs... which sucked for Saturday at work because I was so dizzy and out of it and my medicine was making me all dehydrated so I need to go get some water so I told my boss Jake and he rolled his eyes at me.... between being sick and that it set me off and I went in thr bathroom and cried to my Mom.... so after work Jake offered to buy a round of drinks so I went.. me and Jake were the last ones to leave so we got to talking and I'm glad cause he's really not as bad as I thought and he even appoligized to me... 

So yeah I bought Chris Ryan 2 shirts from Abercrombie for a Valentine's Day/Thank you present... I think certain people aren't happy about this but in my defense Chris has done more for me in the past month than anyone has in the past year... I have not been in the greatest spirits lately but Chris has helped me to smile... so if i seem to favor him so what.. maybe I do... it's not about how long you know someone.. it's about how well you know them... so basically Chris deserves to be spoiled sometimes... so if people don't like it get over it....

We went to Heaven last night (me, Randy, Chris, AJ, and Matt) ... it was OK except for the drama.. I got pretty wasted.... I actually lost my phone in AJ's car and passed out on my living room floor in the clothes I went out in... I woke up and puked up sex on the beaches ... LMAO

Tommorrow is the dreaded Valentine's Day.. I sorta have a Valentine but not really.. I'm working all day anyways and my Valentine has a Valentine so I won't even see them... but to keep it real there'a always the little part of me that hopes somebody has a secret crush on me and will send me flowers at work or soemthing... but being a realistic person I know this won't happen

"event","The more and more I have worked on making myself into who I wanna be the more I have realized that girls are absolutely insane... I know because I am one and used to be just as crazy... but the more I've matured and grown as a person the more I realize that it is not what I want to be... I actually have learned to respect how guys are so NOT insane and have strived to be more like that... Let's go over some examples:

1. My ex girl and her new girl once smashed in my back windshield of my car (damn what did my car do to them?)
2. My friend Bryan from work brought his girl to a strip club and asked if it was OK if he got a lap dance...  she said yes... then afterwards she contemplated dumping him cause it bothered her (Bitch why  did you say yes then?)
3. I gave my number to the kid I sit next to at work... we're friends... that's it!.... his ex-girl found it and burned it (Damn bitch I see him like everyday burning my # ain't doin shit and you burned it?... you couldn't have just thrown it away?)
4. I chat online w/ this kid Brian.. just as friends... he's my friend on myspace and shit.. so his ex-girl writes to me basically cause she swears I like him or something... which I don't because I never LIKE anyone! (bitch your his ex anyway.... what do you care who he talks to?)

so yeah I think that sums it up right there.... it's because of things like this that make it hard to be a bi-sexual girl... because really I hate girls... I guess this is why I hang around w/ a bunch of boys... because this kind of psycho drama is really ridiculous and annoying....

I mean I LOVE girls... they're beautiful but how will I ever meet a decent one when they all do things of this nature?????"

I'm mad that I did that....

"event","Well this weekend has been pretty cool.... I spent most of it with my boys.... On Friday I worked all day then just stayed in and Jose came over and watched a movie... then on Saturday I worked till 5 then took a nap... then Shane and Matt came over for a sleppover.... then on Sunday me and Matt (my hubby) ran errands and shit then we went to Jason's B-day party thingie (we were about an hour and a half late) then we hit up Avalon... Greg, AJ, BJ, Chris, Ben, Carl, Allan, and Jimmy were also there... oh yeah and Jose.... but he was actin shady so whatever man.... Jose's ex Diego was there... he was adorable... I love him now..lol ... but yeah it was this kid Tim's b-day... poor kid couldn't even stand but hey that's how you know you had a good b-day.... some white bitch was wasted and was like all over Chris... what a dumb girl... he doesn't even like the pussy.... but yeah everytime someone tried to like get her away she would jump on them.. she even jumped on me... at one point I got soooo mad I pulled her hair.. but she thought it was Chris flirting... lol... but i ended up saving him in the end... he was happy... but he returned the favor cause some skeevy guy was all up on my shit and he saved me... I &hearts; Chris soooooooo much! So then me and Matt came home and cuddled and passed the fuck out.... we woke up and watched Dodgeball and played the Sims.... it was a good motherfucking weekend....

So I decided I really haven't written about Matt too much so I'd like to talk about him now.. I actually met Matt 2 years ago through Carl... we both go to Ramapo and at that time so did Carl... so one day Carl invited me to lunch with Matt and some other peeps.. so I went and I didn't like the kid.... so I saw him again over the summer at Gay Pride and still didn't like him... lol ... but then when we started chillen at Colo I saw him all the time... but from chillen with him there I finally started to like him.. and since then we started chillen more and more and now I love him.... he's my best friend.... and he's introduced me to the most amazing people in the world.. I'm so grateful.... the reason I like Matt soooo much is cause he's not fake at all... he always keeps it real..... I chill with him at LEAST 2 times a week....  and NEVER have we had issues... plus he's a fucking cunt like me and he hates everyone like I do.. so we relate to each other a lot.... another great thing about Matt is he's a GREAT cuddler.... there's nothing I like to do more than cuddle with Matt... (and to all you stupid people who are thinking.. damn she likes this kid... I don't.. I like him as a best friend.. he's gay) .... but I think Matt is just really misunderstood and once you get past his front he has a really big heart that few get to see... he's just amazing.... so if you ever get to meet him.... talk to him.. it's worth it...

I &hearts; you my Matt (my hubby)

I mean I'm kinda over all the old issues now but seeing them together bothered me a little only because I've known Carl forever and we used to be BFF but I feel like I've been replaced... but after a couple drinks I got more comfortable with it... Carl assured me I have not been replaced.... and me and Ali were even chatting too..... so in the end I'm glad I ran into them... it helped to kinda resolve some unfinished stuff.... and I must thanks Alvin for totally hooking me and Jose up all night.. that was incredibly awesome of him! ... and must I say Steve was looking absolutley hot as usual =) .... but yeah I had a great time last night..... so thanks to all who made this weekend amazing: Matt, Steve, Chris, CJ, Greg, Steve, Carl, Ali, Jimmy, Jose, and many other random people... here's some pics from last night....

"event","Well just wanted to do a quickie update.... Christmas was cool.. I went to my Aunt and Uncle's... (the one's I used to live with) ... they got me like 80 candles... for real... and a gift certificate to my hair salon.. woo-hoo..... I needed a cut!! My Uncle mad e the best Lasagna ever... then afterwards I hit up Heaven w/ my 2 best boys (Anthony and Matt) ... we had mad fun... I got to see Steve and Vito... (That's always cool) ... I swear the more I get to know Steve and the more I see him the more I develop my sick little crush on him.. if only the boy liked the punani... I'd be all over his shit =)   ... I hope he never reads this.. lol  ... I got in at like 5:30 AM and slept all day on Sunday...

Monday I started my first real day in Customer Service.... and I must say ... it is about a billion times better than credit... mainly cause I don't have to see Karol's stupid ass nearly as much.. lol .. if only they would move me a little further from Mina I'd be happy... then I'd really be away from all the credit inbreeding... lol ... I'm so glad I don't mess with boys from SCA .... or else I'm come off looking like them.... I noticed I tend to rant about this a lot.... but seriously nothing aggravates me more at work.... not even the 81 year old man who yelled at me for 10 minutes yesterday... 

BTW... Bank of America sucks.... they made me cry today.... I hate them

I'm off tomorrow.. I plan to take care of all my bills and clean and shit... then nap.. then go to Feathers with my peeps as usuual.... I'll see Steve there... haha... Vero told me she might go.. that would be soooo much fun..... I hope she does

Well that's enough for today.... good night!"

"event","Well it's now 7:38 AM and I can't sleep because it's Christmas..... I remember being a little kid and waking up mad early to open girfts. I know you're all thinking, ""Corinne, you're a Jew"" .... but my dad was Catholic so when we actually talked I would always spend Christmases at his house. It used to be soooo much fun.... on Christmas Eve we would stay up real late listening to Christmas music and eating Christmas cookies... then on Christmas day my dad would wake me up all early to open my girfts... and my Dad always got the best gifts. Then we would go to my Grandma's for a party with the rest of my fam. I was usually the only kid there and they would all tell dirty jokes in Polish so I couldn't understand. My Aunt Marla always made this rice cake that was out of this world! Then my Dad would bring me home and I'd get to show my Mom all the cool presents I got.... Damn I really miss those days

I mean not even Hannukah is cool.... it used to be my fam all got together at my Uncle Steven's and we'd all exchange gifts there and eat.... but ever since my Pop-Pop died the fam just doesn't really speak so they all do their own things I guess.... I'm nevere invited to functions because I think the Fam sometimes forgets that my Mom is all the way in Texas and that I no longer speak to my father. Even Thanksgiving is pretty bad. I don't even get crads for my birthday.

So as I've gotten older I've begun to really hate ALL holidays.. it's just not the same as it used to be.. it's days like this I actually miss my father.. I wish for once in his life he could act like a real man and take responsibility for his mistakes.... I mean I am his ONLY child! How dare he be upset with me for saying he wasn't a good Dad when he wasn't. I mean any man who leaves his 10 year old child waiting for them to pick them up and never shows on a weekly basis isn't so great. Any man who constantly talks crap about their childs Mom isn't such a great man....

Yet he is my Father....and I guess just for that reason I will always have some love for him"

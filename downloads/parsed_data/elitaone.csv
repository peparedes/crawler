"event","*some mechs in nearby rooms quite possibly heard this little exchange...*<br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Bitch, WHAT?""><font color=""#ff00ff"" size=""2""><p><font color=""#000000"">Elita was furious. So furious, her hands were shaking and her body trembling as she walked through the halls of the Ark. She wasn't sure who she should be angrier with, Soundwave, for threatening one of her squad, or Arcee, for goading him into being a jerk in the first place. She knew she needed to talk to both of them, but she was still furious with Soundwave, especially for his reactions and things said, but yet left unsaid. Arcee would be who she spoke with first. It wouldn't be hard to find the femme, Arcee was generally found lurking in her room these days, a room Elita had set up for her when Arcee and Barricade were having problems. Elita felt a twinge at the memory, though she shook it off. Pulling herself upright, she approached Arcee's door without a sound, then stopped in front of it, rapping sharply on the metallic door.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">::Who is it.:: Arcee's impersonal comm cut Elita like a knife, and she reminded herself there was now no way Arcee would be able to know it was her.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">::Elita. Open the door.:: Elita's voice was sharp and also impersonal, and inwardly, she chided herself for being petty. She stepped forward as Arcee's door slid open without further questioning, and it snapped shut behind Elita as she took in the room in front of her. It's clean, tidy, even throughout Arcee's self confinement she's kept the room neat. The black couch is littered with pink pillows, Arcee's favorite color. Another inward cringe is withheld from being outward as Elita remembered buying those for Arcee. Elita looks up at Arcee, who is sitting on her berth, looking cross.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Why?"" Elita's question is crisp, and straight to the point was the best option. Her and Arcee had never really played games.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Why WHAT, Elita? Why did I shoot him? Or why was I being a bitch?"" Arcee shot back, rather matter-of-factly.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Both."" Do not get angry, do not get angry. Arcee gave a shrug.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""He actually sort of started it. He kept pushing it into my face we no longer have our bond."" Arcee said, folding her arms over chest. Elita sighed and rubbed a hand over her face.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Infighting is not acceptable, regardless of who said /what/. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do in this situation. You and Soundwave have never gotten along, and I don't expect you to be friends."" She left unsaid that she wasn't even sure where she and Soundwave stood. This was the first time he'd been angry with her, and she wasn't quite sure why he was.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Yeah I know."" Arcee shrugs. ""So what are you gonna do, Elita? What's my punishment?""</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Just..."" Elita sighed. ""Don't do it again. Leave him alone, and he'll leave you alone. I'm quite furious with both of you right now. Infighting is the last thing we need, especially with everything that's been going on."" </font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Yeah. Fine, whatever."" Arcee said.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""And apologize to him."" Elita added on, voice stern. </font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""What?!"" Arcee exploded, eyes narrowing at her leader. ""He threatened to kill me if I talked to you about anything other than work related issues and you want ME to apologize to HIM?!""</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Yes, I do, because if you hadn't been acting like a sparkling in the FIRST place we wouldn't even be IN THIS MESS."" Elita hissed back, her temper waning.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""I can't BELIEVE YOU! You keep running back to that selfish glitch over and over and over, he rambles how he doesn't want to share, how he can't possibly see you with anyone else. He's so damn possessive that it's DANGEROUS for you, but you're so blind that you can't see whets really going on!"" Arcee shouts back at Elita, eyes glittering dangerously. It's concern for Elita, as opposed to actual anger over their lost bond that fuels her argument. Arcee's pretty sure that their bond is done, and while she misses it, like she told Springer, she's feeling better about it every day.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""He's my BONDED, Arcee, and BOTH of you made mistakes. Do not delude yourself into thinking that I do not see what is going on. I SEE how he is, I see how he acts, and YES, I'm angry with him right now, but /you/ have to understand that HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND, NOR WILL HE."" Elita's chest is heaving, and she gives Arcee a fierce look. ""He is a Decepticon. He cannot understand what we lost without having to experience it himself. Even then, he will not."" </font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Do you not fucking understand HE THREATENED TO KILL ME?"" Arcee shrieks at Elita, her fists tightening into balls. ""You are foolish if you think that is something he would not do!""</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Of course it's something he would do. However, YOU should not have been goading him in the first place."" Elita said, her voice strained from attempting to stay calm. ""Both of you are in the wrong. Now, I'm through with this argument. Apologize to him, or go to the brig, Up to you.""</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Fine. I'll apologize. But don't EVER send him to repair me again."" Arcee said, eyes flashing. She squeaked in surprise, however, when she was suddenly pinned up against the wall, Elita's forearm up under her throat and holding her to the wall.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Do not presume to tell me what to do. I am still your leader, bonded or not."" Elita's voice was deadly cold, and it sent chills down Arcee's back. A slow smile crept across Arcee's face as she studied Elita. This was the Elita she remembered, not one who was broken and frazzled by mates, petty arguments, and broken bonds. Elita always had a cold streak in her, and it was showing for the first time in a long time.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""That's better."" Arcee grinned at Elita, tilting her head to give her a crooked smile. Elita hissed at her, applying more pressure to Arcee's throat.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Do you understand?"" Elita asked, tone of voice still the same. Cold, merciless....cruel.</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""Oh, very well."" Arcee said, still grinning at Elita. She did understand, Elita was her leader first and foremost, that's how it had always been. The bond had always been second. ""I apologize, Elita."" She meant it too, she hadn't /meant/ to upset her leader. ""But in the future, if you could perhaps send someone else instead of Soundwave, I'd appreciate it.""</font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""That's better."" Elita said, releasing Arcee as she stepped back. ""Please do as I ask."" </font></p><p><font color=""#000000"">""I will."" Arcee promised, crossing her arms. Respect for her leader finally winning over, her belligerent attitude was fading.&nbsp;<br /><br />""Thank you."" Elita said, turning to leave. Arcee hesitantly reached out to grab her arm.<br /><br />""E-Elita? It's ah...really over, isn't it?"" Arcee is still somewhat clinging to the bond, but something new blossoming in front of her keeps her from clinging desperatly.<br /><br />""Yes."" Elita's answer was soft, but her voice was sad now. ""It's for the best, I think. Do not worry, everything will be fine.""<br /><br />Arcee nodded with a tiny smile, several things coming to mind. ""Yeah, it will. See ya, Elita.""<br /><br />...""Goodbye, Arcee.""</font><br /></p></font></div>"

You have shown me that you can hold your own in a fair fight, and your aim is still the best I've ever seen, and it's better than Arcee's. <strike>That isn't saying much right now, though.</strike> Also, your stealth ability has not suffered. You certainly gave me a run for my money. I hope that you have learned a lesson, as well.</div><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Chromia"">I have no criticism for you. The only thing I can tell you is to continue what you are doing, because it's working perfectly. Our session was by far the best.</div><br /><br /><br />I think that the sessions went well, all things considered.&nbsp;If any of you wish to schedule further training sessions that aren't mandatory, please comm me or Ironhide.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Soundwave"">Is everything alright?

I have given you my share of the cubes that Santa left me, you can find them in your room waiting on your berth. There are also three of <a href=""http://www.palagems.com/Images/tanzanite/tanzanite-45.10cts.jpg"">these</a> waiting for you on your table. I realize they have absolutely no practical purpose, and they are only desired by humans. But, the humans <i>do</i> seek them, and they are rapidly becoming one of the rarest and most sought after stones on earth, right after Alexandrite. I thought you would perhaps appreciate their beauty, and the fact that they came from me. I hope you like them. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""[Arcee]""> <b>Arcee.</b> As far as your gift goes - I again was unsure what to bestow on you. As you are staying with me right now, you have made it also quite hard to do anything as a surprise. So I have done this for you: I have created you your own room, as you had done for me. It is done mostly in pink and black, and I must say - I think you will like it.

When I awoke yesterday to find myself surrounded by turkeys and the aroma of turkey legs, I was slightly perturbed, and I am rather hoping you move into your new room soon. I find myself quite glad that I made this room for you. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""[Femmes + Nightbird]""> <b>Femmes + Nightbird.</b> All of you will find a new gun on your berth. I realize that I am a tad late in this, but I was away on Christmas day itself. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""['Breaker and Warpath]""> <b>'Breaker & Warpath.</b> I understand you are having...issues. My gift to you both is the offer of always listening, and always being there for both of you, should you so need it. My door is always open, if you need me, do not hesitate to comm me or come see me. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""[Brawl.]""> <b>Brawl.</b> I realize that for obvious reasons, we do not speak, and we do not care for each other. I would like to remedy that, for Soundwave's sanity and maybe even my own. My gift for you is an offer of friendship, however tentative and shakey it might be. </lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""[Jeff]""> <b>Jeff.</b> You will find a <i>plethora</i> of video games, for both the Wii and the PS3. I did not know what you liked, to I got the entire stock of both. Enjoy. </lj-cut>

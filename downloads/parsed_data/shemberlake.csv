"event","Monday I woke up with Lisa for the first time in over a month, so was in a good mood from minute one. Fannied about the house until heading to work which as always is a pile of shite. Came home, had dinner then bed.

Tuesday I was up for my long day. I actually got myself up which I was quite chuffed with as I felt with my maw being away, I had nae chance. Work was average, a few arseholes. Had lunch then the same again. Came home and recieved the most unexpected of messages. Let's just say someone from my past, who I do and will always still care about made me realise how much of a wank I've been. I've said a lot of things on this about this person that weren't true, just because I was hurting. For that I apologise. Lisa came over, lay around watching South Park before going to bed.

Wednesday fannied about the house with Lisa until heading to work. Another load of shite. Place is actually a joke, so bad, even <b>I'm</b> considering leaving. Came home, made a beast of a dinner, played some Fitba Manager then bed.

Thursday lay about playing Fitba Manager all day. Got the bus into work. Same shite different day. Came home, Lisa came over, made some dinner then fannied about watching DVD's until bed.

Friday I had Lisa waking me up at ten to nine in the morning as she was going to TITP. Needless to say couldn't really get back to sleep. Watched some pish on BBC about the bombings in London. Headed into work which was pish until the Account Manager asked to see me. Now, knowing this cunt has a particular dislike for me, I knew I must've done something. Whilst racking my brain to figure out what I had done, He was telling me to supervise. Result. Ended up talking to the same retard twice because he couldn't understand that the Prem+ offer had ended. Came home, fannied about then bed.

Saturday fannied about all day until meeting Kev at Tesco. Got some beer, then I restrung my Tom Delonge and we jammed for a while. Got a chinese in then watched Germany fucking maul Portugal. Gregor then made an appearance. A flat reunion if you will. Sat up until 5am watching the TITP highlights and last week's Still Game. Bed.

Sunday woke up at 10am as the first TYTC band practise in almost 2 years was happening. Woke Kev up and fannied about until getting the bus in, meeting Kev and our new drummer on it. Finally found Lo-Fi, rather nice. Jammed all the old ones (there's finally a copy of 'Innocence Lost' on tape now!!!!), and recorded some tracks that Kieran and our bassist had worked on and that me and our new drummer had done. Got the bus back home, with me and Kieran heading to Tesco so he could buy beer and meet his missus. Headed back tae mine and watched South Park for a while then Kev arrived. We all munched then watched the World Cup final. Spence missed the first 10minutes of it but the game was alright, wasn't the best. Zidane's headbutt was a tad ridiculous. Chuffed the Italians won it because I fucking hate France. Don't like Italy either, just hate France more. Watched some more TITP highlights then everyone headed around the midnight mark. I ended up crashing at maybe 2am."

"event","Monday woke up earlier than usual as I was heading to Kev's before work. Got to his where he and I discussed the trip to Santa Ponsa. The only thing the hotel will be good for is sleeping in. Me and Master McCann then departed for the bus. Got into work, pile of pish. Came home, dinner, Still Game, bed.

Tuesday up for the long day as per usual. Load of shite. Home, dinner then bed.

Wednesday I'm sure I did something, but not exactly sure what. Work was gash, home, dinner, bed.

Thursday did fuck aw, worked.

Friday I got up early as I was supposed to meeting Kev to give him money for the Santa Ponsa adventure, BUT, due to some fatal accident on the motorway, they shut the motorway off, so everycunt was being diverted via Stepps. Needless to say, it was nose to tail and I ended up spending about an hour on the bus, which made me unable to meet Kev. Got tired of the shenanigans on the bus and got off at Stepps, getting the train. Made it into work by a bawhair. Came home, watched the highlights, bed.

Saturday I awoke to an empty house, as the family have pissed off somewhere for two weeks. Fannied about downloading club tunes as Kev had booked the flights to Santa Ponsa. Jumped down to Kevs just before 4pm to watch the England game. Started getting tanked. Game eventually went to penalties and Kev ended up throwing cushions. Portugal won and I ran outside spraying a bottle of beer all over the place. Was covered in Carlsberg. Drank for a while longer then headed to Kieran's. Ordered a chinky to his, got some games of Pro on the go. Got rather tanked. Kieran and Kev then engaged in the greatest version of ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash I'd ever heard. Close to tears. Taxied it hame and passed out.

Sunday I watched Easties then fannied about the rest of the day until Lisa came round to stay over. I cooked her dinner, watched some Big Brother then Scarface. Bed.

Keep your eyes peeled for some updates on the return of TYTC.

"event","Monday did hee haw all day until heading to work. Grabbed my usual from Greggs and got into work. Load of pish. Came home, had dinner and watched the first in the new series of Still Game. Fucking amazing. Bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. Same old shite. Home, dinner, bed.

Wednesday was the same as Tuesday but without the long day. Watched the highlights. Bed.

Thursday same as Wednesday.

Friday I managed a shift swap, so instead of working at night, I worked the morning. Was a belter getting out at 3.30pm. Got home and watched the final ten minutes of the Ukraine v Tunisia game. Had dinner and fannied about playing Fitba Manager until 8pm, when I watched the first half of the Togo v France game. Headed to Tesco and got a shitload of booze, then got a taxi to Lisa's before going to Kieran's, where we joined Kieran, Kev, Audrey, Nik and Cleland. Then Spence and Del joined in. Tried to teach everyone how to play poker, but wisnae for happening. Got a taxi with Kev down the road about 4am. Bed.

Saturday met Kev and Andy to get booze from Tesco to watch the first set of Second Round games, Germany v Sweden and Argentina v Mexico. Germanny game was class. Headed around half six to get dinner, deciding on a KFC. Headed back down to Kev's, getting beat of Andy at Pro Ev. Sophie then joined us then we headed to the Jack Snipe to watch the Argies game. I was shitting it half the time, mainly just due to me having a fiver on the Argies at 8/1 to win the tournament. They won eventually. Had a few more double vodkas then myself, Andy and Kev decided to go to Sax. I ended up leaving early as I was falling asleep. Walked down the road and stopped by McD's to talk tae Geo and Urkit. Got home and passed out after having toast.

Sunday woke up rather rough. Watched Eastenders then the England game. Jammy wanks. Had dinner then went to head up Lisa's but was phoned by Div, who wanted some advice on a Sky install he was getting. Wisnae even fucking working. Finally managed to get to Lisa's, watching the absolute shambles which was the Portugal v Holland game. Watched the Austin Powers film after that and then got a taxi back down the road. Discussed a holiday with Kev in Santa Ponsa and then watched some of Vengance, then bed.

So we know the quarter finals now. Germany v Argentina, Italy v Ukraine, England v Portugal and Brazil v France. Hope to fuck Portugal maul England. At least the bint I had the last time these teams met isn't around anymore.

A thank you also goes out to John Hartson, for his contribution to Celtic over the last five seasons. Cheers big man."

"event","Monday I woke up still chuffed with John Cena losing, then I watch Sky Sports News and find out Roy Keane had retired. Gobsmacked. Went to work, got to floorwalk, came home, had dinner then bed.

Tuesday, as ever, up for the long day. Legit couldn't be arsed with it. Lunch was the highlight of the day, although I did get to take over a call from a guy who was actually, the thickest cunt in the world. Came home, had dinner, bed.

Wednesday I had the day off due to me having tickets to go see Angels & Airwaves. Fannied about the house until Lisa came down, then watched Spain mauling Ukraine. To be honest, I still see Ukraine getting through. Mum then made us dinner, spaghetti bolognese, yaws. Headed for the bus into town to head to a pub first before the gig and met Evo on said bus. Headed to the Ark and watched the last ten minutes of the Tunisia Saudi Arabia game. Left about 7.30pm and headed to the Barras. Had a few more pints in there, then bumped into Gemma and Sophie. Angels & Airwaves were absolutly immense. I seriously couldn't believe what I was hearing. Tom even managed a little solo performance, playing 'There Is' by Boxcar Racer. Left the Barras and managed to buy a hoodie and a tshirt, then headed to Worst Kebab. Got the bus home, fannied about the bed.

Thursday I just sat about before heading to work. Did pretty much nothing there, came home, had dinner and fannied about before bed.

Friday, pay day!!! Went up to Asda and lifted my maws dig money out then headed to work. Grabbed my customary daily sausage roll and pie from Greggs and headed to work. Got to sit and do nothing, although I was rather gutted I missed out on seeing the Argentina game. Came home, had dinner, watched the end of Jonothan Ross then the highlights of the day's World Cup action. Argentina were immense. My two bets are starting to show, fiver on the Argies at 8/1 and a fiver on Spain at 12/1. Although to be fair, Spain have only played one game, so let's see what happens when they play Tunisia.

Saturday got my hair cut. It's the standard Shem do, I'm still beautiful though. Came home and fannied about here until meeting Kev, Andy and Stu up Asda as we were all congregating over at Andy's for the World Cup. Asda stopped their deal on beer so we went to Tesco's instead. Watched the Portugal game, which was dull to be honest, then we got a tournament of Pro Ev. Somehow, I have no idea, after getting gubbed by Stu in the first game, then drawing with Andy, I made it to the final after a win over Kev. Got gubbed by Stu again. Left Andy's and met Nik and Spence up Tesco before heading home, just to head back out again to go up Lisa's, as Saturday meant it was 6 months that we'd been together. Smeshing. Got dinner, watched TV then came home.

Sunday I pretty much sat in all day. Watched the first half of the Japan Croatia game then watched Easties. Then watched the Brazil game, which was rather dull. Had dinner then went to Lisa's and watched a few DVD's before getting a lift hame aff her maw. Played Fitba Manager then bed.

No plans for this week, although this week does see the final round of group games in the World Cup. Mon the Argies."

Before I do the weekly update, I would like to thank Roy Keane for the last six months of his career.

So, Monday did the usual shite. Sat around, fannied about then headed to work. Boring as fuck. Came home, had dinner then bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. Was sitting talking to some fud on the phone, then saw wee Anton. Totally shocked that he was working in the same place, immediatley asked for him to be my buddy. Sat and talked to him for ages about McD's and shit. Wee cunt's amazing. Got given another buddy after that as well. Had lunch then floorwalked. Came home, dinner, bed.

Wednesday woke up refreshed as fuck after the long day. Did the same shite and just fannied about all day, even at work. Home, dinner, Fitba Manager, bed.

Thursday exact same as Wednesday.

Friday I had the day off, for the first day of the World Cup. Sat around the house doing fuck all, all day until I headed into town to meet Kev. Went to Times Square to watch the Germany v Costa Rica game. Game was a cracker, Philip Lahm and especially Thorsten Frings' goals were outstanding. We were then joined by Pete. Grabbed dinner, had a fucking huge burger which I thought I wouldn't finish. Left there and went to O'Neill's for the Poland v Ecuador game. Game seemed to go on forever and of course I was disappointed by the score. Left there and went to Underworld, but after a while, we were asked to leave as I had been caught on camera stealing the Spain flag they had up. Went to the Catty but around 1ish, me and Kev headed for a Lomond Bite, but missed the bus. Got a taxi up the road and met Gemma Acreman. Got in, then passed out.

Saturday woke up rather rough. Watched Smackdown and played Fitba Manager for an hour then went to Asda to get more booze and jumped to Kev's to watch all three World Cup games with the 56, Andy and Stu. England v Paraguay game was dire, and at half time, Nik appeared. Watched the second half in the garden, although due to the sun, couldn't see fuck all. Watched the first half of the Sweden v Trinidad game in the garden, then the second in the living room, with me getting a curry in between. The Argentina v Ivory Coast game was a belter. Nik came back down after leaving a party, but we all ended up leaving just after 12. Walked home in the rain, fucking soaked. Bed.

Sunday woke up a bit rough again. Sat watching TV all day. Watched Easties, then the Holland v Serbia game, which was quite good, then the Mexico v Iran game. Rafael Marquez fucking ran the show. Headed up Lisa's after dinner, watched some of the Portugal v Angola game, then Big Brother, followed by Little Nicky. Lay around with Lisa for about another twenty minutes then headed home. Watched ECW's One Night Stand. Fucking immense. Rob Van Dam FINALLY winning the big one.

Angles & Airwaves on Wednesday!!!!! Along with Spain v Ukraine before it. Fucking immense."

"event","Monday woke up at the standard time and generally fannied about til about maybe half one then went to HMV and bought the Angels & Airwaves album. Grabbed a Greggs then got the U/G to work, where I sat staring at the CD case dying to get home and listen to it. Finished work, grabbed dinner and was completly blown away by the album. It is actually the greatest album I've possibly ever heard. Bed soon after.

Tuesday was up for the long day. Finished everything I had to do for the entire day around 11am. Boredom for ages until I was told that we were to have some security briefing, in the stadium. Felt sick every single millisecond I was in there. So relieved tae get out. Work was fud after that, headed home, Lisa came over and we watched a DVD then bed.

Wednesday woke up with Lisa and lay in bed until heading to work, which again, boring as fuck. Came home, dinner, DVD, bed.

Thursday was the same as the previous day, only difference was meeting Lisa and grabbing a curry. Watched a DVD then bed.

Friday I had the whole day off, due to going to see Taking Back Sunday. Lay in bed with Lisa until she had to go to work. Finished my packing then headed to the Barras around 8ish. Taking Back Sunday were amazing, as if I expected anything less. Bumped into a few familiar faces, but I was truly blown away by the amount of myspace burds. Got the 62 back to the flat then me and Kev headed to the Catty, where the fanny was unreal. Got a wee bit drunk then went home.

Saturday woke up rather hyper for some unknown reason. Andy came over and drove us and all our shit back home. Felt so wierd unpacking everything back into my maws. Felt like I had just came back from a holiday or summat. Had dinner then went up to Lisa's for a while, getting a curry in the process. Decided to accompany the 56 to the Catty so taxied it in. Fanny was a less impressive than the previous night, but awright. Grabbed a Lomond Bite and got the night bus. Felt wierd as fuck being on that. Passed out when I got in.

Sunday sat about my room watching TV. My maw bought me a new comfier computer chair which was immense. Had dinner then headed to Kev's, drinking some beers and playing Pro with him and Stuart. Around 11ish, headed to Sax, which wasn't as full as we'd expected. Left and headed for the chippy, meeting John McHaffie outside. Met Lisa then headed home, taking a detour to vist Edith in McD's. Got home and we both passed out."

"event","Monday was standard. Woke up and did absolutley nothing apart from play Fitba Manager. Headed to work at the usual time and found out that due to a shortage in numbers, I would not be doing my acting T/L duties. Aw well. Came home, grabbed a chippy, watched a DVD then bed.

Tuesday I woke up at 7am for my long day, but unfortunatley I went back to sleep and woke up at 8.35am. Shat myself and headed to work right away, managing it in for quarter past. Sat in a corner and did three days worth of stats for three teams, which took all of an hour. Sat and pretended to be busy for the rest of the night. Came home, watched some Family Guy with Lisa, fell asleep.

Wednesday I had the day off due to the Champions League final. Lisa left earlier than usual which was upsetting. Wank of a landlord then came round and showed three girls the flat then me and Gregor then decided to head up to the council office in John St to find out our rights regarding the mess that was getting our deposit aff the Paki landlord. Found out some rather interesting things like the Asian cunt hadn't even registered us there. Left there then me and the G-Man went to Tesco for a bit of shopping. Had some dinner, then just before the game, myself and the 56 headed to the Paki's shop and had it out with him. Finally got him to agree that we would indeed get our deposit back after mentioning solicitors, although due to the fact this cunt can't speak English at all, we misundersttod and thought he was asking us not to threaten his sister. Headed back to the flat and I was in such a good mood, I was handing out Amstel's. Watched the final and was fucking bouncing after the game. Fucking amazing score, although game was ruined by a shite ref, as well as the landlord coming over TWICE to show cunts the flat. Inconsiderate wank. Bed around 4am after drinking myself senseless.

Thursday woke up with a bit of a hangover. Headed to work usual time and sat and did nothing all day. Headed home and grabbed dinner for myself and Lisa. Munched that then watched some more Family Guy. Bed around 4ish.

Friday woke up with Lisa and lay in bed all day talking to her before heading for work. Did absolutley nothing again apart form talk to Nicola. My current job consists of copying and pasting from Excel. Cless. Came home and had a few with Kev, Gregor and Waxl before heading to the QM. Bumped into Gemma Scott inside. Didn't get too fucked. Came home then bed.

Saturday sat in my room playing Pro Ev with Kev and Gregor half the day, then started packing clothes for the move back home. Basically have the bear essentials in clothes at the flat. Lisa came down for about an hour and packed my DVD's and CD's up. Walked her to the bus stop then headed for a curry. Came home only to discover the stupid bitch in the Chinky's had given me Chicken Chow Mein. Asked for the correct order again and the bitch tried to charge me an extra 30p, so had to go back to the flat again to get my wallet, to return and then get told they had overcharged me. How hard is it to hear the words ""Chicken CURRY without onions?"" Cow. Munched that then discovered Lisa had left her mobile at mine. Played some Fitba Manager then went to meet Lisa and her pal Nic for a few in Firewater, bumping into Steve's wee sister. Ended up going into one of my moods and leaving after Lisa and Nic headed for the ABC. Came home and watched some Still Game before crashing out. Was then rudely interupted by Kev who came in at 4am to have a heart to heart, which he can't even remember. Finally ended up getting to sleep again about an hour after.

Sunday woke up and fannied about my room until about 1.30pm then me and Kev jumped a taxi to the bus station to head back to the nauld. Sat and Easties in my maws then had dinner before putting all the clothes I packed the previous day away. Left around 7ish and headed back home. Watched Raw and then sat playing Fitba Manager and watching Still Game. Bed.

Busy week planned. Angels & Airwaves album 'We Don't Need To Whisper' is out tomorrow, going to see Taking Back Sunday on Friday, and then moving back to Cumbernauld on Saturday.

"event","Monday was standard shite. Up fuck knows when, Football Manager then work. Came home, chippy then bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. Got to walk about for three hours which was grand. Just couldnae be bothered wae cunts. Came home, Lisa came over, had dinner, watched Goal, then Open Water, which sucked baws, then bed.

Wednesday lay in bed with the missus all day then headed to work. Was advised that some of the Account Managers were thinking about putting me in as acting Team Leader whilst Jim was away. Score. Work was gash apart fae that, came home, dinner, Fitba Manager, bed.

Thursday same shit, different day. Fitba Manager til heading to work. Got called into the meeting room and was told I wouldn't be acting T/L, but I would be doing stats for four teams, a trial period if you will. Bonus. Started on that right away, easy pish. Came home, bought dinner for me and Lisa. Munched it then me and her watched Heat. Class film, but she fell asleep. I fell asleep around 4ish.

Friday lay in bed with Lisa then went to work. Did nothing all day as the date for stats wasnt updated. Class. Fannied about then came home, grabbing a Subway on the way. Did some washing as the clothes were starting to pile up. Felt like watching a DVD so headed to the shop were the Paki serving came out with some amazing comment about some drunk burd and how it would be her own fault if she got raped. Tears. Watched Batman Begins then bed.

Saturday I did some more washing, and catched some of both the Scottish and English cup finals. Both winners being jammy cunts. Grabbed a curry then headed to the Ark to meet Kieran. Had a few in there, but the big man wasn't up for heading out after it, so met Lisa and Nic at the bus station and headed to the ABC, meeting Evo, Gregor, Waxl and Pete. Place is not all that good. Sat with Lisa outside for a bit then headed home. Bed.

Sunday headed to my maws. Watched Easties, had dinner then went up to Lisa's for a while. Met her maw. Left around 10ish, got home just before 12am, watched some Raw then bed."

"event","Monday I had the day aff work due to the fact is was May Day. I did nothing. Well, I played Fitba Manager, but truthfully I did hee haw. Got rather bored after a while and then ended up gasping for a pint, so invited young Gemma Scott for a few. She came round to the flat then we jumped over to Stavka. Nice pub. Soon after we were joined by the pleasurable double act of Kevin and Evo. After a few more we decided to Garage it, but Evo never had ID so me and Gemma just sat in the Attic all night listening to the amazing music. Got a bit steaming, then me and Gemma walked back to the flat.

Tuesday up for the long day with a hangover. Nae good. Almost falling asleep at every turn. Day was rather gash, until we were informed that one member of staff had been diagnosed with TB and they were giving shitty letters advising we were all safe or some shit. Very reassuring. Came home and sat watching a DVD with Lisa. Fell asleep.

Wednesday woke up refreshed as ever, especially seeing my beautiful lady beside me. Headed to work at the usual time. Same old pish but different day. Found out my wee cousin had miscarried which made me feel a little sympathtic. Came home, dinner, Fitba Manager, bed.

Thursday was the same as the day before. Went to work and was out having a fag when that mental thunder and lightning started. I was seriously terrified. Came home and bought the dinner for me and Lisa, who had been having a wee drink in the Local with the 56. Munched that then me and the lady decided to go to the Garage. Tried to convince Kevin to come, but he declined. Got in nae bother, stood up the balcony then had a few in the Attic. Left after like an hour and a half. Watched a DVD then bed.

Friday woke up with Lisa, lay in bed until having to go to work. Got to floorwalk for a few hours which was enjoyable. Came home and had a little drink with Kev, but both of us couldn't be bothered going out. Ended up playing Fitba Manager til god knows when.

Saturday I woke up just before 9am to book Angels & Airwaves tickets. Stumbled about for a bit trying to negotiate gravity at that time of the morning on a Saturday. Got two which chuffed me up, went back to bed. Woke up again around 12ish and sat playing Fitba Manager til half two, then I jumped up to meet Gregor and Kev in Wetherspoons. Put a line on first, going mental as I stuck a tenner on. Needless to say it was fucked from minute one. Halfway through the second half, went to HMV and bought a few DVD's and Taking Back Sunday's new album. The three of us then attempted to go to speak to the landlord bout the deposit, but alas, the Paki bastard wasn't in. Me and Gregor went for a curry, then a few hours later, we jumped to the Garage. Was rather good. Also included some ugly burds at the cloakroom asking if I was a model. Came home and started watching a bit of Family Guy when I was rudly invaded in bed by the other two. Frightened, I phoned Lisa. Kev then preceeded to ask me questions about Catholicism. After they left, I shoved the couch against the door to try stop any more invasions.

Sunday woke up and me and the 56 headed to the Nauld. Sat in my maw's and watched Easties then the Arsenal game. My coupon was fucked by Everton and Celtic. Had dinner then waited on Lisa coming round. Headed up to Asda then McD's before going into town for a drink in the Ark. Only managed one in there as both of us were in the mood for something else. Left there, grabbed a Subway then taxied it to mine. Saw her on the bus home then watched Backlash and Raw, then half a season of Family Guy. Bed.

Nae plans for this week, but next week is the Champions League Final. Arsenal 1, Barcelona 3."

"event","Monday woke up and sat on this for a while then played some Fitba Manager. Went to work, usual standard shite. Came home, had a chippy, bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. Easy as fuck. Came home and sat and watched Football Factoty with Lisa. Film's fucking class. Went to bed about 3ish.

Wednesday lay in bed with Lisa until heading to work. Usual pish. Hame, chippy, fannied about, bed.

Thursday fannied about playing Fitba Manager as usual. Work was gash, came home and bought me and Lisa dinner. Watched a DVD then bed.

Friday I had a rather emotional morning. Woke up with Lisa, went to pick up my wage slip, had a look in it to see my attendance bonus had been put on it. Fucking class. Was well up for getting pished. Then I walked into Gregor's room to advise him that I would give him the gas and leckie bill soon, due to my bonus of course. He then reveals Kev and him are planning to move back home. Then 24 Amstel fucking arrive. Needless to say, mix of emotions everywhere. Went to work, came home, sat on this for a while then headed to the Catty to meet Gregor and Kev. Was an awright night. Headed up to Sauchiehall St after and got me a Subway. Home then bed.

Saturday woke up with a little bit of a hangover. Went up to Driftwood with Kev and Evo to watch the scores to come in, as well as the Newcastle game. Coupon humped as per usual. Me and Kev then walked up Great Western Road looking for some Pizza Hut that Kev knew he hadn't imagined before. Couldn't find it so walked through Kelvingrove Park and got a chinese. Got home and we had a lovely candlelit dinner. Sat on this for a while then headed up to the Ark for Cleldo's birthday. Ended up being the only cunt there until Kieran and Audrey showed up.  Amanda arrived shortly after, as did Spence. Gemma and Niall came in also but they sat upstairs. Started getting pished then noticed Niall leaving abruply as usual. Went upstairs and talked to Gemma, advising her of the Angels and Airwaves gig. Headed to the Catty bout 11ish. Standard night in there. Left for a Subway, came home and stuck on my Cel'ic DVD. Fell asleep just after Gemma coming into my room with a Huns tap on. Nightmares.

Sunday woke up and fannied about playing Fitba Manager then headed up to my Maw's, where on the way, I saw TWO fucking orange walks, then saw Artur Numan. Jesus. Sat in my maw's and told her I'd be moving back in for a few months. Watched Easties then had dinner wae my cool uncle and his missus. His son's a Jambo. Ugly cunt. Came home and watched Raw, then Lisa came over and we watched Jaws. Bed around 4ish.

Angels and Airwaves tickets on sale Saturday moning. Yaws."

"event","Monday I had the day aff work due to it being a bank hoaliday. Fucking loving it. Did fuck aw but. Sat and played Fitba Manager and this thing all day. Had dinner, sat on this again and then bed.

Tuesday was up for my long day. Same old shite, different day. Came hame, Lisa came over, watched a Digital Versatile Disc then bed.

Wednesday Lisa left earlier than usual due to her actually having a job now. Sat on this until heading to work which yet again, bog standard. Came home, had dinner, bed.

Thursday woke up and generally fannied around. Came to work and found out that they were now operating a 'no paper on your desk at all due to the fact that you could be writing customers direct debit details down' policy. Stood and laughed at this joke. Work was pish. Headed home and bought me and Lisa dinner. Munched that, watched Independance Day, bed.

Friday wasn't in work. Hoaliday. Me and Lisa woke up around 10ish, then headed to go on the Glasgow Tour Bus. The tourguide was a tim, which was class. Learned so much. Felt like being in school again. Cold as fuck but. Got off that then went shopping for each other's present. She got me a wonderful Ipod nano, and I bought her a watch. Went to the cinema and saw Ice Age2. Was fucking class then we went for dinner in the Sports Bar. She ordered a 16oz steak, medium to rare. Bowlk. I somehow managed to mangle a spag bol for free. Was awrite, wisnae as good as Kev's but. Headed down the road, bought some munch, two DVD's from Global and watched them then went to bed.

Saturday and I turned 22. I'm a fucking old man. Headed around 10ish back round to my maws. Got some awrite shit from them. Had dinner and watched first half of the Chelsea Liverpool game. Met Kieran on the bus and headed to the flat to go get changed. Headed up to the Ark, was sitting down when some faggot had the cheek to ask me for ID. Grabbed a taxi down to the flat to grab my passport, driver was a knob, and found Gregor up to no good in my room. He mentioned a suprise so left him to it. Headed back to the Ark, where we were joined by Audrey. Lisa's pal and bro soon joined in festivities, as did Lisa and all the rest of her pals, and also the 56. Even met Lisa's sister and Da, with Lisa's sister Sarah mentioning I was gonnae be an uncle due to her being up the duff. Knocked back her invite to babysit. Gemma Scott made an appearance, as did Spence, then somehow me and Lisa had a major falling out, which led to me storming out. Went to go to the Catty, but decided I was too fucked and went home. Started downing voddie like mad, then Lisa came over and shit was sorted. Passed out soon after 3am.

Sunday woke up extremly hungover. Somehow managed to get out of bed and head to the Grove to watch the game. Standard game. Happy with the result. Headed to my maw's, had dinner, watched Easties, then Lisa came over and we went to the cinema and saw Inside Man. Class film. Still don't know what happened. Walked her to the bus then walked home, watching a fight on Sauchiehall Street in the process. Got home, watched Raw and started a Fitba Manager game with Spurs, seeing as I've lost my amazing Cel'ic game. Seven games in, four wins, three draws in the league, third round of the league cup.

Taking Back Sunday's new album is genius."

"event","Monday I woke up and my mouth even bigger than what it had been the following day. Rushed up to the dental hospital to get it sorted. My mum joined me after I mentioned to her that it would cost. Had to get two teeth out. Was bogging when the first one came out, cos the absess just started draining out. Came home, took some drugs, then lay in bed all day, even phoned in sick for work. Sat on this for a while then bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. My mouth was still iffy, so I had to eat on my left side, which was fucking annoying. Found out that the account managers had been saying to Maddo that I didn't sound ill when I phoned in. Ridiculous. Floorwalked for a bit. Came home and suprisingly wasn't knackered at all. Had Lisa sitting waiting on my doorstep. She stayed. Watched a DVD then bed.

Wednesday up at the normal time, lying in bed with Lisa until having to go to work. Work was standard. Came home, had dinner, sat on this, bed.

Thursday up at usual time. Went to work. Nothing to shout about or even worth mentioning. Came home and Lisa came over with my curry. What a girl. Scoffed that and then I attempted to watch Wrestlemania again, although Lisa kept laughing at it, so I'm never watching wrestling with her again. Sat up til god knows when winching and talking.

Friday I had a day aff. Fucking class. Well it would've been if I had done something worthwhile. Lisa stayed in until heading home at 2pm. Sat playing Fitba Manager all day. Had another curry then started on a few cans. Headed to the Catty with Kev and Andy, joined at one point by Evo, Gregor, Shona and some other burd. Music was trash, so me and Andy headed for some food. Bowie also came back and kipped on the couch.

Saturday went round the bookies to put a line on I'll know that'll torture me. Played some Fitba Manager whilst listening to Soccer Saturday. Coupon was away. Couldn't decide what I wanted for dinner so went for another curry. Sat on this basically all night. Found a class Glasgow hip-hop act called Empafy. Bed.

Sunday I was woken up by about a million bikers. When I say a million, I'm not exaggerating, there was genuinly about a million of them. Headed up to my maw's who let me play about with my new phone. Phoned Vodafone to get my number kept. The lovely people there will also give me 30quid worth of credit on 15th May cos I stayed with them. Was sitting watching TV when Kieran phoned telling me he had a date for my birthday, put the burd in question on, yet I legit never knew who it was until she mentioned it. Audrey and Kieran had got back together, was fucking chuffed to fuck. Immediatly offered the both of them a drink, so headed into town to the Ark to meet them two. Had a couple then I went for a Subway and then sat watching Raw and playing Fitba Manager.

Aye so me and Lisa's birthday celebrations from around 8pm onwards in the Ark. All those who read this are invited. Saturday 22nd April."

"event","What a fucking up and down week.

Monday woke up the standard time and fannied about the flat as per usual until heading to work. Work was rather tedious, but I was sitting shitting myself incase my maw didn't get Leeds tickets which went on sale. Thankfully, she got two. This will be the fifth year in a row. I am Leeds king. Came home, had dinner, did fuck aw, then bed.

Tuesday was up for my long day. Couldn't be fucked with it, then at around 11ish, my maw text me to tell me Vinnie, TYTC's old van driver had been killed in a road accident. Needless to say, wasn't in a frame of mind to be working, so spoke to Maddo who let me go home at 3.30pm and put through the rest of the day as a holiday. Came home, had a bit of scran, lay to watch Easties then ended up falling asleep. Lisa woke me up but which was ok. Watched a video, bed.

Wednesday I had as a holiday due to the Celtic v Hearts game. Lay in bed with Lisa all day, then she left around 4ish. Grabbed a few beers from GG's then had Kieran come down. Had a few in the flat then headed over to the Grove to watch the game, where some old guy kept mistaking Kieran for a burd. Game was average, I went bezerk when the final whistle went. Jumping about like a mad cunt outside the Grove. Came back to the flat and tried to open the bottle of Christmas Ale I have but just wasn't for happening, so we ended up just shaking a few cans, then had a beautiful rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone. He left, then I sat up playing Football Manager then went to bed.

Thursday did fuck all until heading to work. Was boring as fuck. Got to floorwalk and basically look after the whole place but. Some customer wished Bird Flu upon me, nice. Came home, Lisa bought me a curry, had dinner then watched Dangerous Minds. Fucking class film. Found out some cunt got shot in my old street at my maws. Menatl. Max and Paddy was the follow up. Went to bed around 4am.

Friday woke up with Lisa as per usual, and lay in bed until I had to go to work. Got to watch the floor again. Came home, had a few beers and played Football Manager, then bed.

Saturday my face was sore. I had noticed it earlier on Friday, but it gradually got worse and worse. Went to the bookies with Kev, sat in my room listening to Soccer Saturday. Both coupons fucked. By then, my face was really killing me, so stuck on The Scorpion King and went to my bed. Kev was lovely and bought me some paracetemol, a mixture of those and about an hours kip did the world of fucking good. Sat in Kev's room with a wee drink, then we decided to head to the Catty. Some burd started chatting up Kev in the queue who was tidy. Stood at the bar for most of the night, talking to Bowie and her pal Haley. Had Bowie crying on my shoulder at one point, she came and stayed at ours. Bed.

Sunday woke up and my face was rather swollen. Fucking absesses. Went to my maws who gave me some more paracetemol. Watched Easties and some of the Man Utd Arsenal game. Had a snooze then went to Tesco to meet Nik. Sat in the swing park beside Kwik Fit with her having a few cans until we decided it was too cold. Headed for the bus then just lay in bed watching Wrestlemania (which was fucking class) and Raw. Bed.

Well today the absess had got bigger so went to the dental hospital who've taken two teeth out. Absess is gone thank fuck. Taking today off work, which reminds me, I better go phone in."

Tuesday I woke up at 5am. Mainly due to the fact Gemma Acreman buzzing the door at that time. Did my long day in work and to my suprise, I wasn't zombified by the end of it, mainly due to the fact I wasn't on the phone and floorwalking. Came home, Lisa stayed over, watched a DVD, bed.

Wednesday I lay in bed with Lisa until having to go to work. Floorwalked again. Didn't even attempt to go on the phone. Work was also funny due to the fact that some nignog bitch I don't like got suspended for assulting big Lynn with a chair. Summat ye just don't dae. Came home, had some dinner, sat on this for ages then bed.

Thursday, same as usual, sit on this before going to work, although the new system went live in work, and I was running about helping every cunt on it, cos I know more than most people combined. Eventually got papped on the phone. Load of pish. Got a lift home from Katie then sat on this until Lisa came over. The girl still buys me a curry every thursday night. Fucking love her. Sat and watched the entire fourth series of Still Game, well, a few episodes got skipped over as we weren't really paying attention if you know what I mean. Sat in bed til like 4am just talking and arranged everything for our birthday, seeing as both our birthdays fall on the same day.

Friday watched the episodes of Still Game that we hadn't saw the previous night then I headed to work. Load of pish again. Came home and sat on this all night. 

Saturday woke up earlish and went round to the bookies then sat doing nothing until me and 56 went for a jaunt around town. Went for a few in the Local, where we were joined by Gregor then went to Driftwood who were showing the Newcastle game. Came home for a while then the three of us plus Andy went for a chinky. Andy and Kev went to the casino, I just sat on this and watched Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Wierd plus class film. Bed about four or something.

Sunday went up my maws. Watched Easties, some of the West Ham game, had dinner. Came home, watched Raw then sat on this til god knows when.

So the birthday plans would consist of, Friday is me and Lisa day. Just doing stuff together. Saturday morning I'm going to my maw's, then big night out starting in the Ark. Time to be announced."

Monday I went to go sort Kev's keys out, but instead of the guy fixing them, he ended up not only still destroying Kev's, but mine also. Headed to work which was boring as fuck. Sat on the phones most of the day. Load of pish. Came home, had dinner and found out the internet was working again. Thank fuck!!!! Sat on this downloading tunes til about 3am then went to bed.

Tuesday as always is my long day. Woke up fucking kackered and legit couldn't be bothered the whole day, got to play on the new system which was fun. Came home, had dinner, missed Lisa, bed.

Wednesday, met Kev around 11.30am to go and finally get the keys sorted, only costing us a tenner a piece. Thank fuck. No getting intae doors sucks. Went to work and got to floorwalk and basically do pish all day. Home, dinner, bed.

Thursday fannied about on this for ages then went to work, which ended up being braw. Got to floorwalk with the new system and picked it up so quickly. I'm the best in there. Did that all day and felt like every burd on that particular pattern was staring at my amazingly good looks. Nae wonder but. Came home and Lisa was waiting with my chinese. The burd is actually the best ever. Had dinner then me and Lisa sat lay and watched Die Hard's 1 and 2. Bed.

Friday woke up at the usual time and watched Die Hard With A Vengance. Went to work and supervised on the new system again, wearing my amazing brand new, bright yellow shirt. Trained my team on some system that will be running when old system is down. Yet again, every burd checking me out. Came home and sat playing Football Manager until Gemma Acreman phoned asking to kip at mine, bringing me beers in the process. Sat and drank til 5am then passed out.

Saturday, jumped round to the bookies with Kev, then sat in my room with the 56 and Acreman until Gemma went to work, then me and Kev sat drinking in my room, talking about fitba no doubt, and then the esteemed Mr G. McMillan joined in. Got rather blootered then Gemma stayed again. Passed out.

Sunday I woke up to my maw phoning to make sure I was coming round, then fell asleep again until 2.30pm. Headed back to the Nauld with a disgruntled Gemma as we'd abruptly woken her up. Got home, watched Man Utd v Birmingham, had dinner, then came home, watching Easties and a rather average Raw.

Plans for this week include walking around work looking like a canary supervising, seeing Lisa, and eradicating Jews."

<b>Tuesday</b> up for the long day. I don't mind doing this shift, I just hate getting up at 7am. Had some complete tits <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=phone&v=56"">phone</a> up. Went for lunch, then went upstairs to do the rest of my shift. Got to floorwalk which is always a bonus, but for some reason, I kept getting complete tits wanting to talk to supervisors. Nae cunt messes wae me. Came <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=home&v=56"">home</a>, Lisa came over to stay. Watched a DVD which I cannae mind, then went to bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> and I had the day off. Fucking belter. I had planned on doing washing and some general tidying up, but I seriously couldn't be fucked. Lisa left around dinner <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=time&v=56"">time</a>, I went and grabbed a few beers. Kev and Gregor went to the Huns vs Villareal game, meaning I could watch the Chelsea Barcelona game. Pretty good game, Del Horno should never have been sent off, brilliant result.

<b>Friday</b> woke up to Lisa. The girl is actually amazing, she is the greatest girl I have ever met. I seriously think that this one is a <u>very</u> long term one. I fucking <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=love&v=56"">love</a> her. Me and her just lay in bed talking then I had to go to work. Supervised. Easy. My Team Leader was saying there are going to be around four or five Team Leader <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=jobs&v=56"">jobs</a> coming up and I should be going for it. I'm seriously thinking about it, extra five grand a year, only thing I don't wanna do is change my shift pattern to the three long days cos I can't be arsed waking up at 6am on a Saturday morning, but for an extra five grand, it's something definatly to be considered.

<b>Saturday</b> got up then headed around to the bookies. Grabbed a spot of lunch then sat and watched <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=Soccer&v=56"">Soccer</a> Saturday.

<b>Sunday</b> was rather hungover. Left the flat with Steve and Kieran, stopping by Wullie Hills to put a <a href=""http://www.ntsearch.com/search.php?q=bet&v=56"">bet</a> on the Carling Cup final. Headed to my Maw's for my weekly feed. Watched the Carling Cup final, which I felt rather saddened about. Mon the Latics.

This vacation's useless
These white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this 13-hour drive
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
The days have come and gone
Our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you swear you loved me more

Do you care if i don't know what to say
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will i shake this off pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that
loves a girl

Do you care if i don't know what to say
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will i shake this off, pretend its all okay 
that there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Do you care if i don't know what to say?

Not last week but the week before I basically supervised a lot in work, saw Lisa and drank a lot.

Last week, Monday, did hee haw then went to work, consisting of me supervising yet again. Hame, dinner, bed.

Tuesday up for the long day. I'm relativley suprised that I can get up at 7am without my maw's assistance. Was on the phones for about half an hour then I got told to supervise on the big floor. Promotion hehe. Did that til three then went put a line on and had something to eat for lunch. Supervised my team but was running around like a heidless chicken, so much so the account manager stopped to ask if I was alright. Came home knackered. Lisa came over so that obviously lifted the spirits. Had a chippy for dinner.
Bed.

Wednesday I was up early yet again, this time for some cunt to activate a phone line or whatever. Thank fuck the cunt came around 9ish. I was fucking knackered the whole time in work, but I was supervising again so that made up for it. Home, and had a curry, my first in like three weeks. God it felt good. Bed.

Thursday I think I slept forever. Up and out to work but alas, wisnae supervising this time. Fuck it, couldn't care less wether I'm up or down, I'm braw. Came home and me and Lisa had a curry. That girl is legit the best ever. (Love you darling). Went to bed at some ridiculous hour.

Friday up early AGAIN?!?!?! This time the missus was attempting to get T in the Park tickets. Alas she was unlucky and never got any. Thankfully, I got two pre-sale tickets when last year's festival ended. I'll need to keep an eye out for Leeds tickets too. Imagine me <b>NOT</b> going to Leeds? Would be like the end of the world or summat? This year marks five years in a row. Went to work, wisnae supervising but wisnae caring. Came home, got changed, had a beer then myself, 56, Gregor, Fulgore and a few others headed to the Catty. Got rather pished, the fanny in there was the greatest I'd ever seen. Came home, bed.

Saturday was up bout 12ish. Me and Kev put a line on, got our hair cut, then I went to buy some wireless connector for the broadband, which alas, disnae work cos my computer is ridiculously shite. My coupon was fucked but Kev's got fucked with about 5 minutes left, Bristol Rovers eh? Had yet another curry, started drinking then me and Kev headed into town to meet Waxl and Evo to go to the ABC. It's alright in there, a bit expensive but I met Derek fae River City in there aka that wee cunt fae Chewin The Fat who just started masturbating. Felt like asking him if he'd finished masturbating. Came home, scran, bed.

Sunday went up tae ma maws as per usual. Watched Easties then Lisa came round to meet the parents and to have dinner. By all accounts, all went well, as I had predicted. I'm sure they love her. Went up to McD's for a flurry, got all the usual questions. Headed for the bus then just sat on thsi all night.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah internet. Feels so good. 

Chelsea vs Barcelona on wednesday. Cannae fucking wait, got the day aff. Huns vs Villareal as well. I think Rangers could scrape a score draw at home, but no chance in Spain. 

Viva Riquelme."

Pretty much supervised in work the whole of last week. 

Sky cunt came in on Friday and installed it. No bad having Sky Sports back.

Went to Newcastle, dumped the stuff then started drinking heftily. I ordered porn in the hotel room. Woke up on the Saturday dying for Irn Bru or potato scones. Went to the Newcastle game, that team is diabolical. Left the game, got a pizza hut, got a horrible yet hilarious joke played on me by Kev, went out and got blazing again.

Sunday came back up, rather tired.

This week pretty much supervising again, but cos I went nuts with money in Newcastle, I'm skinto mcglinto. Lisa stayed tuesday and thursday night. 

Last night Evo and Andy came round, sat and a couple of beers, they left to go to the Garage, Lisa stayed again. She is actually the best. Love you darling.

I got tae supervise which obviously is a belter. Came home, had dinner, bed at like 3am.

<b>Tuesday</b> long day. I hate this shift, in fact, I don't actually mind it, it's me going to bed around 3am and not getting enough sleep that pisses me off. Anyway, pile of shite. Came home, stayed up til like 4am playing Champ. Bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> I know for a fact I set my alarm for 12, but typical me, I just turned it aff and went back to bed. Then I woke up at half2, shitting myself. I was up for like maybe a minute when Katie came to pick me up. Legit knackered. Work was gash. Came home and stood in Gregor's room wae the big man himself, Kev and Evo, when our toilet started leaking everywhere. No joke, soapy water was coming from underneath and up through the pan. Gregor ran to get the landlord, I strolled out and got a curry. Got a plumber out, turned out that the drain outside was blocked tae fuck. Wee bit of excitement eh.

<b>Thursday</b> work was gash again. Was supervising then had to do this training on this new system malarkey. I was getting pissed aff wae it, it's all windows based, cunts telling me I'm gawn too fast. I'll too fast you ya tit. Came home, had dinner, me and Gregor watched the Butterfly Effect til 5am.

<b>Friday</b> work was actually the same as the day before. Came home and found out we're getting Sky in on Friday. Noooooooo bad by the way. Watched dvd's aw night then bed.

<b>Saturday</b> woke up and got me a paper as per usual, then fannied about until Kev got up so we could go up the bookies. Put a line on then headed up to watch the rest of the Man City Man Utd game in the Sports bar.. Celtic game was on so was loving that. Coupon obviously humped. Came home, played some trvial pursuit with the lads before heading back to the nauld to stay with Lisa. Met her brother. Mauled everyone there at poker. Stayed up til 6am or something watching Bad Santa.

<b>Sunday</b> woke up and kicked about Lisa's for about an hour then headed down to my maws. Watched some of the Wigan game then my weekly dose of Easties. Had dinner then headed to meet Kieran for a drink or five. Were joined by Spence and Bacrlay, folowed by Gibb and her ""man"". Headed around hawf11 and had a mighty scran. Bed.

Plans for this week include attempting tae see Lisa, watching a Sky enginner, and partying in Newcastle. Oh aye, and watching Newcastle get gubbed lol."

"event","Fuck sake I need to update this a lot more man. Trying tae remember what I've been up tae.

Right so a two week update it is then. Well for Chrimbo I stayed at my maw's. Headed up Christmas Eve wae the 56, saw Lisa for all of a minute. Christmas was awright, got some Amstel, watched about 5 years of the Premiership. Went up my aunts for a while then watched Easties Christmas special which was a belter. 

Boxing Day I fannied about watching Sky Sports then took all the stuff I still had to from my maw's house like my pc and shit. Headed back to the flat. Went to the Garage with Gregor and two of his mates, but it wasn't exactly the best.

Had the next day off work which was good. Fannied about. Worked a two day week in work as they gave me the friday off as well. Lisa came down on the thursday night which is always my favourite time of the week, when I see her. She's fucking braw by the way. Friday night watched Dennis die in Easties (actually pure gutted) then headed to the Catty with Kev, Waxl, Evo and Gregor.

New Years Eve put a line on which as always did fuck all. Had dinner in some pub in town with Kev then started drinking around 7ish. Sat in Kev's room with Gregor, Kev, Michelle and her pal, headed up to King Tut's to go see some guy called Chris Gorman, but we ended up missing him and headed back down the flat. I passed out around one on my couch yet woke up in my bed with no trousers on. Fucking wierd.

New Years Day I sat listening to the Hearts Celtic game, and obviously was overjoyed with the result. Had dinner in my maws house then came back and sat alone til about 4am.

Had the following day off work which was awright but came back to my long day on tuesday, knackered material. Supervised wednesday and thursday. Friday sat in my room doing fuck all. Last night me and Kev sat playing pro then went to a pub round the corner from the flat to watch the second half of the Barcelona game. Belter of a result. Came back, had a another drink then Cattyed it.

Today I'm just having dinner at ma maws then back tae the flat.

Roll on Newcastle on the 20th. Me Kev Evo and Gregor off for a weekend of dirty antics lol."

"event","Time for a weekly update, I really fucking need the net in that flat of ours, it's killing me not having it, that and Sky Sports.

<b>Monday</b> woke up rather late, this is starting to become a bit of a habit, and it's no healthy. Went to work and was given a buddy, who was a filthy Paki with shite for breath. Bogging man. Finished work, had dinner, tried to sleep.

<b>Tuesday</b> was meant to be up for the long day, but as I slept in, that was fucked. Managed to change it for Thursday though. Fannied about playing Fifa until going to work. Got to floorwalk and just spent half the time talking to Katie and helping out all the new starts. Pure pish shift. Came home, dinner, bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> did pretty much the same as I did the day before. Work was pish easy an aw, floorwalking out ma nut. Came home and had dinner. Evo and Gregor were in my room playing Pro when I came in. Attempted sleeping.

<b>Thursday</b> was up for my long day, I had about 50 alarm clocks going off to make sure I woke up. Pure boring shift. Came home and just sat in my room. Kev and Gregor asked if I wanted to head out, so jumped at the chance. Headed for the Catty but me and Kev wanted to go to the Garage, so headed there. Met Bowie and one of her mates, followed by Gemma Andy and Niall. Seen Angela and wished her a happy birthday, not that it meant much to her. Came home and passed out.

<b>Friday</b> woke up rather hungover, went to work and did fuck all basically. Came home, talked to Bowie and Kev for a while then fucked off to the Catty for Kit's birthday, meeting him, Bob, Smith, Debbie, Yarr, Steph and Major in there. Had to stop a fight between some cunt and Bob. Mental. Left around 4ish. Passed out.

<b>Saturday</b> woke up hungover. Went round the bookies then up Sports Bar to watch my coupon. Fucking Ross County. Came home, had dinner, then spent all night cleaning my room and watching dvds.

So aye, I'm now officially going out with Lisa, she asked me out last night. She's so fucking amazing.

Catch ye's."

"event","Fuck sake. I have not updated this in a long fucking time. The flat not having the internet is the reason of course. Need to get that sorted. Missing Sky Sports like fuck an aw. Not living in Cumbernauld rocks though.

So what have I been up tae then? Trying to remember here.

Obviously, I've moved out. I'm still trying to get used to the fact that I live ten minutes from the Garage. It's unbelievable. Stayed at the flat the day before moving, cleaned it up a bit and shit. Been fannying about my room most days until having to go to work. I get lifts from Katie which is brulliant. 

Party was out of control. Think I only knew like five people. All sorts was happening. The lock on the front door is humped, me and Kev were on coke, someone spewed in the bathroom sink and I had to unblock the sink, oh aye, and someone broke the handle aff the bog itself. Standard party. Went to the Garage on Tuesday with Kev and Gregor after the dirty orange bastards going through to the last 16. They'll get humped anyway. Got abruptly woken up yesterday by an orange walk. Fucking ridiculous. Then the TV Licence board chapped my door. Emotional morning. Obviously my coupon was humped. Went to the Catty with Kieran and Spence last night, rather gash in there. Saw the video Kieran made for Twist Of Fate, hilarious stuff.

Still seeing Lisa. Things are progressing well, she's been staying over night and stuff. Saw her today after she finished work. Pure really like her, she makes me so fucking happy that it's untrue. She means the fucking world to me. Not going out with her yet but things are actually going that well that I sometimes struggle to believe it. I'm forever thinking about her. Not gonnae let what happened with Angela happen this time. No fucking chance. I care about Lisa far too much. I cared about Angela too, but I've learned from my mistake. 

So aye, that's basically it since I moved out. No doubt I'll update next Sunday when I visit the maw again.

Swetch.

P.S. Happy birthday (for thursday) x"

"event","<b>Monday</b> woke up my usual time, and fannied about the house until having to head to work. Met Rabsin at the bus stop. Got to work and our team got shafted upstairs, and due to the lack of seats, me and Katie had to floorwalk. Probably the easiest shift I've ever done. All we did was play some song lyric game and Operation. Headed home, watched Scotsport, had dinner, bed.

<b>Tuesday</b> up for the long day. As often as I do this shift, I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Got given a buddy at the start of the day, who happened to be in the year under me in school. Also found out that a burd from girl group Lemonscent works in my work, she's fucking stunning!! So aye work was pish, was almost falling asleep at my desk I was that tired. Ordered a curry on the way home, munched it, played some Fifa then went to bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> I had a fucking day off. Thank fuck. Got up at like noon or something, headed up the T.C, purchased a new wallet then fannied about the house until having dinner. Had dinner then boosted to meet Kieran as we were going to the CIS Cup game. Got to Paradise and bought a pie and bovril almost right away. Could've kicked fuck out some wee fanny sitting in front of me. Game was terrible, Celtic didn't particularly play that well, it's just that Rangers are THAT bad, it made us look good. Walked up to get the 36, and got off at Crowwood to get the X5 back up the road. Jumped into Asda to top up my phone, came home, played some Fifa, bed.

<b>Thursday</b> was fucking boring. Same shit, different day. Headed to work and got to floorwalk as the two Team Leaders had some meeting. As much as I love doing it, it aint half boring sometimes. Came home, Maw made me some dinner, played Fifa all night, bed.

<b>Friday</b> is pay day. Being paid weekly is rather superior. Gave my Maw her dig money and shit then headed to work. Some burd got fucking wide cos I couldn't turn her Sky back on, even though she had paid the bill that day. Stupid bint could not grasp the fact that it takes three to five working days for it to come to us. Couldn't be arsed heading out, so went home, had some dinner and played Fifa all night.

<b>Saturday</b> I had a major lie in. I love no working the weekend. Headed up the T.C to return the wallet I bought on Wednesday cos my Maw bought me a better one, bumping into my boy Kieran in the process. Had a wee McD's, got all the usual questions from them. Food was shite. Headed back down the road and watched the Scotland game. It was that bad I feel asleep during it. Watched the last half hour of the England game. Fannied about the house for a while then headed to Kev's. Watched some Max and Paddy then played some Pro Ev, I got gubbed every game. Me, Kev and Andy headed into town, meeting Niall on the bus and headed to the Ark for one. After that headed for the Cathouse. Got in for free with my Party In My Pocket, yaws. Stayed downstairs for a while and I must say I was impressed with the new decor. Headed upstairs, meeting Gemma Acreman and Div from Psycho Dalek. Gemma invited Kev and I to her maw's engagement party, so we told her she could some round the flat anytime she wanted. She's the one who insisted in low cut tops. Headed back downstairs for a while, had a wee dance, then I ended up losing Kev, Andy and Niall cos I went to say bye to Gemma. Had to get a taxi home with her and Div. Walked up the road and phoned Lisa. Fancy that girl something rotten. Passed out as soon as I got in.

<b>Sunday</b> woke up pretty hungover. Fannied about the house and watched River City and Easties, which was fucking unreal. Was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and the last half hour with Nana Moon was rather touching. I never cried or nothing, it was just emotional. Had dinner then headed into town with Kieran, Kettle and Gibb, meeting Spence later and went to the Ark. Got a few pitchers in, then someone invested in a Sourz Tower. Was pretty tasty, I stuck with my beer. I went for a Worst Kebab and they all headed to Fury's. I didn't fancy heading out as I had some stuff in my head I had to sort. Passed out as soon as I got in. I feel like I'm reliving the exact situation that happened last year, before I fucked everything up. I like her so much that it's scaring me. I've only felt like this twice, and look how both of them ended up. One won't ever talk to me again and the other moved to Edinburgh. There is no way I'm letting what happened last year, happen again. I've learned from my mistake and for once, I'm actually thinking about her first and not myself.

Plans for this week involve hopefully seeing Lisa at some point and the Old Firm and Real Barcelona, both on Saturday. I feel sorry for my voice.

Rest In Peace Eddie"

"event","And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
 
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight
 
And I don't want the world to see me
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive
 
And I don't want the world to see me
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am"

"event","<b>Monday</b> up at 11am as per usual. Fannied about the house until I had to go to work, which as usual, was standard. Couldn't be fucked with it. Came home, had dinner, watched Scotsport. Found out Christian quit WWE, obviously that sent me into a terrible fucking mood. Watched Raw, bed soon after.

<b>Tuesday</b> had to get up early doors to book CIS Cup tickets. I was suprised how easy I got them. Cannae fucking wait. Sat in the house bouncing until I had to go to work. Thank fuck I didn't have to do my long day today, early morning Saturday but. Few cunts trying to start some shite but obviously I took none of it. Came home, had dinner, watched Taboo Tuesday which was fucking gash then bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> woke up to the sound of the mail arriving, and amongst it, was my Old Firm tickets. Was fucking jumping. Fannied about the house a while then headed to work which again was pretty standard. Came home, maw made me dinner, fannied about til maybe 4am then bed.

<b>Thursday</b> woke up to a heavy banging on the door, fucking shat myself. Alas it was just some cunt delivering some parcels, one of which happened to be my Wigan top. Fucking belter by the way. Was in a belter of a mood all day, got to work and got told to floorwalk. Easiest shift ever. I took over one call, and maybe helped four people the whole time. I just sat on my arse texting Lisa. Came home, had some dinner, played some Fifa, then bed.

<b>Friday</b> as always is payday. Headed up Asda and lifted out my Maw's dig money, and then fannied about the house until I had to go to work. Put a line on as I wouldn't be able to manage it Saturday morning. Had to shell out a fiver cos two cunts were leaving, like I care. I got called racist because I wouldn't turn some black cunt's Sky back on because he hadn't paid his bill. Left work and headed home to get dinner. In bed rather early due to being up early for work.

<b>Saturday</b> up at 6am. Murder. Work was alright, all I was getting was ""Can I book the Villa - Liverpool game?"" Around 1pm, things got even better. All the calls seemed to be was people complaining the game wasn't on. There were legit technical difficulties and one bird even expected me to go out and fix the transmitter. Told her where to shove it. Finished work at 3.30pm, and went for a pint in RG's as I was meeting Lisa after work. Got her around 4.45pm then walked up to get the bus. I don't know what it is, but anytime I'm around her, I'm just so nervous, probably cos I fancy the arse aff her so much. Got home, had dinner and then was practically right out the door again to go back into town for Kieran's birthday celebrations. Kieran is 20 years old. That's just fucking scary. Met him and his wumman in Campus, giving him a loan of the ""Kiss Me"" tshirt. Had a pint and Kettle and Spence arrived soon after, and then Jen came around 9ish. Did the keepy up dance to ""I Predict A Riot"" with Kieran. Headed to the Garage around 11pm, kicked about beside the bar then headed to the Attic. After a few more drinks, Jen and Audrey decide to winch each other, such a beatiful site. After that, Gregor appears, flaunting his ticket to the Old Firm game in the league. After a few more drinks, Gregor challenges me to a dance off. I mauled. Me and Kettle boosted just after 3am and got a taxi with two burds who Kettle seemed to know, I just passed out in the front seat. Got home and passed out again.

<b>Sunday</b> up at like 11am or something. So hungover. Jen phoned me as soon as she remembered winching Audrey. Fannied about the house until River City came on, the watched the amazing Eastenders. Was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Cannae fucking wait for next week's omnibus. Had dinner then watched the Real Madrid - Zaragoza game, then Barcelona - Getafe. Such a scrappy game, but a deserving win. Pernia's goal should be made goal of the season. Played Fifa for a while then came on this, then played Fifa again til around 3am, then bed.

Roll on Wednesday, my first Old Firm game in five years. Cannae fucking wait. Mon the Hoops!!!"

"event","<b>Monday</b> fannied about as per usual before heading to work. Got told I was going to be floorwalking for all the new starts. Pish easy shift. Half of them were well firing into me. I'm not suprised, I am rather good looking. Found out as well that the flat got trashed at the weekend by the people who lived there previously. Puts off the moving date for about two weeks, but at least the flat will look good. Came home, had dinner, watched Scotsport, bed.

<b>Tuesday</b> up for the long day. Knackered from minute one but I got given a buddy to train up. Got a cheeky half an hour off the phone to teach him everything. Was alright. Rest of the day was rather standard. Was ready for sleeping by the time I finished. Got home, made some dinner, bed around 2am.

<b>Wednesday</b> woke up refreshed as fuck as I always do on Wednesdays. Fannied about the camp then headed to work. Boring as per usual. Cel'ic score was quality. Came home and had dinner. Played some Fifa then went to bed.

<b>Thursday</b> was bored shitless fannying about the house. Going to work was almost a relief. Bumped into Bowers on the bus. Work was boring as per usual. I love winding up people I don't even know. Headed home and whilst walking through Buchanan Bus Station, bumped into Lisa Goldie. Stood and talked to her for a few minutes, winching her in the process, then got the bus home, bumping into Niall and Pammy. Had dinner, then watched Raw, then bed.

<b>Friday</b> woke up praying that my bonus had came through. Went up to Asda, and there was a massive queue, adding to my anguish. Finally got to the machine and checked the balance. Started jumping about when I saw it had came through. Headed to work around my usual time. Our team got fucked around as per usual and was moved upstairs. The whole computer system crashed for like an hour, which was fucking amazing. Left work, grabbed something to eat, and headed to the QM to meet Kev and Andy. Got in there and was astounded by the fanny for about three minutes, then me and Kev started talking about football. That takes priority over any woman. Went downstairs after a while, got fucking steaming. Left at a time I can't remember, got a taxi from just outside Kelvinbridge. Can't wait to move out by the way, none of this night bus and taxi business. Passed out in Stu's room almost as soon as I got in.

<b>Saturday</b> woke up hungover to fuck. Watched Soccer AM for a while then headed up the TC to put a line on. Jumped down the house to watch Soccer Saturday. Almost hit my head off the roof when Wigan scored. Second in the Premiership, fuck yer Arse-nal and yer Man Utd. Ended up in such a bad mood cos Sheffield United drew. If they had won, I'd have won my coupon. Had dinner then headed to Kev's for a few beers and a few games of Pro Ev. I finally fucking won, although, I lost twice. Managed to gub Andy 5-0. Went for the bus and headed to The Hall for a few, bumping into Claire O'Brien from school. What I'd dae for a sniff of hers by the way. Went into the Garage and got fucking steaming, bumping into Jayne and Bowers, then Pami a bit later on. Somehow lost Kev, so me and Andy headed for a Lomond Bite and night bused it. Passed out as soon as I got in.

<b>Sunday</b> woke up with another nasty hangover. Fannied about nursing it until River City came on. Fucking stitches at Archie. Watched Easties as well. Fucking phenomonal. Watched the first hour of the West Brom Newcastle game then headed up to Asda to meet Jen. Headed up to Pizza Hut for some dinner, I just couldn't finish it. I paid for both of our dinners. That's a rarity. After dinner headed to mine to watch a DVD, which ended up being School Of Rock. Watched a bit of Austin Powers then seen Jen to her motor, then headed back in to watch the rest of Austin Powers. Watched Match Of The Day then that program Legless, which was fucking unreal. Came down and watched the replay of the Barcelona Sociedad game. Bed soon after.

No real plans for this week, although November 19th is going to be hellish, Celtic - Rangers the same day as Real Madrid - Barcelona. I feel sorry for my voice."

"event","What a week.

<b>Monday</b> left the house earlier than usual as we were going to see the flat again, this time Kev was accompanying us. Bus was dire so ended up meeting Kev and Gregor later than I was supposed to. The three of us decided we wanted it so were trying to think of ways of coming up with each of our deposits. Me and Gregor then walked up to Byers Road to get something to eat, then I went to work. Got to floorwalk for the first time. Was fucking quality, felt wierd saying ""Hello my name is Martin, I'm one of the supervisors here at Sky."" Came home and had dinner waiting for me. Scoffed then bed.

<b>Tuesday</b> up early for the long day. Fannied about in work, then phoned my maw as she was in Blackpool for a loan of money towards my deposit. Suprised how cool she was with saying aye. Got a buddy in work, the burd is like 40 something, but I'd still give her it. Nice tight arse, she'll be wanting in my pants soon enough. Got to floorwalk again for the last two hours. Came home, had dinner, bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> woke up earlier than usual as I had to go meet Gregor as we had all managed to get the deposit together. Went up the flat and gave 'Dave' the deposit. Me and Gregor went for a celebatory pint, and was then informed that we're going to do a football quiz to decide the order of choice for the rooms. Work was average, I was just in a really good mood. Trying to get home from work was attrocious due to the Huns playing at home. Ended up getting the X37 home with Elaine Liddle. Got home to discover a missed call from one of the managers from McDonalds, so phoned her back, and apparently there's hefty rumours flying about McD's in Cumbernauld about me and Lisa Goldie. I left there six months ago and I'm still being talked about, I am a legend. Had dinner, bed soon after.

<b>Thursday</b> was knackered all day for some wierd reason. Tidied my room, which is now spotless. Went to work and was just bored the entire time. Found out I've got like a week of holiday time saved up. Will probably take that really soon. Phoned a curry before getting the bus, and to my amazement, the bus fucking broke down outside Dalshannon Farm. Majorly raging. Had to get my da to pick me up. Got home, munched the curry, watched some Still Game, bed.

<b>Friday</b>, payday!!! Went up Asda and got the money I owed my maw, then sat on this all day. Started talking to Jen from college like four years ago. I'd still gie her it. She sent me some picture of her massive tits, wonderful. Went to work and some ugly burd was leaving, so they were getting a whipround, I told them to boost. Was trying to save some money after the hefty withdrawl earlier so didn't go out, headed home and had some dinner. Went to bed about 4am or something.

<b>Saturday</b> woke up the standard time. Fannied about on this then went up to the bookies to put my coupon on. Played some Champ then watched Soccer Saturday. Coupon fuck all by the way. My maw asked if I wanted some of the money I'd given her back until the following friday, incase I wanted to go out. Obviously I duly obliged. Headed down to Kev's around sixish and watched the thing about George Burley leaving Hearts. Andy came down then we got a few games of the new Pro Evo on the go. Took it to extra time in one game, then penalties in the other, lost both times. One of these days I'll get a win. Did a dress rehersal of the football quiz as well, I lost in sudden death. Boosted around nineish I think to get the bus into town. Headed to the Hall for one then into the Garage. Fanny was alright. Bumped into Bowie and Jayne, and we stayed up the Attic all night. Boosted for the night bus, which yet again, I passed out on. Got in the house, and passed out again.

<b>Sunday</b> woke up rather hungover, and with fake tan on my leg. Fuck sake. Watched River City then headed up to Asda to meet Lisa Goldie. Went back to mine and watched Easties, which was phenomonal due to the amount of scenes with Ruby Allen and Stacy Slater. Fucking love it. After Easties, we went to KFC for some dinner then when we got back to mine, we decided to go to see Domino. Got into town and discovered Domino wouldn't be starting for another two hours, so went to see The History Of Violence instead. What a fucking bad idea that was. Film was fucking dire. Went for the bus after the cinema and bumped into Tam. Got up the road and watched the last ten minutes of Valencia pumping Real Madrid, then watched some Football First. Played some Fifa til about 3am then went to bed.

Apparently I'll be floorwalking a bit more this week due to one of the Team Leaders going on holiday, and of course, I'll need to start arranging what stuff I'm taking with me to the flat as I believe I move in at the end of the week.

"event","<b>Monday</b> got up and fannied about the house doing nothing as per usual before heading for work. Work was rather standard. My team leader asked if I wanted to swap to the three day shift pattern, told him to boost. Some burd started getting wide, claiming she could fold Sky cos you have to pay a month in advance for viewing, and she wasn't alone in her endeavour. I think I pissed her off when I told her 7.8million other people disagreed with her. Came home, had some dinner then headed to bed.

<b>Tuesday</b>, as per usual, is the long day. Wasn't too bad actually. Even more complete fannys as per usual. I'm amazing at my job. Came home from work and had some dinner then near enough fell asleep as soon as I went to bed.

<b>Wednesday</b> fannied about the camp as per usual. Bumped into Rabsin on the bus into work. Sat and talked about old times. Work was pish as per. Couldn't be arsed with it. Scotland score was rather decent. Standing in the bus station and some drunk prick was giving some black guy abuse for no reason, telling him to get out his country. I was in stitches, then when I walked on the bus, apparently the drunk cunt attacked the nignog. Hilarious stuff. Had some dinner then sat online til about 3am.

<b>Thursday</b> woke up rather earlier than usual as I was meeting Gregor to go see a flat at 12pm. Found the flat and waited outside for a while, eyeing up the local talent. Gregor then phoned the landlord who said he was stuck in Edinburgh. Pakis man. Managed to get another viewing the following day but. Me and Gregor then headed up to Curlers and sat for a few, then I boosted to work, grabbing a Greggs along the way. Work was gash as per usual. Kept trying to persuade Maddo to let me floorwalk. It'll probably happen Monday. Came home, had dinner and watched some Raw. Was rather gash to be fair. bed at like 4am.

<b>Friday</b> up even earlier to get a viewing of this flat. Got the bus into town, and halfway up Cathedral St I get a call from Gregor saying this paki cunt had tried getting us switched to the following day, but Gregor managed to get a viewing at 2pm for us. Headed home for a while then headed back into town and met Gregor to finally see this place. Place is actually quality. The landlord was decorating but I think we'll be probably taking it if we can. I've claimed the big room. The guy was rather cool with us getting Sky as well which is a bonus. Left the flat then headed to work which was a load of pish as per usual. Got invited to a party in the west end by Kev, but decided against it. Headed home, had some dinner, watched some porn and went to bed.

<b>Saturday</b> got up and headed to the T.C. to get a haircut and put a line on. Fannied about on this then watched Soccer Saturday. Coupon fucked as per. Was dying for a night out, but Kev was knackered, Kieran was ill, and Kettle was skint, so was a night in for me. Watched the Barcelona game, was fucking disguted, then watched The Girl Next Door. Film was quite class. Then I watched American Beauty, even better. Bed at like 3am.

<b>Sunday</b> woke up around 12ish. Fannied about then watched some River City, then fannied about again til Easties came on. easties was fucking quality. Stacy and Ruby back on my screen. Cock in hand material. Had dinner then played some Fifa then watched that 100 Sexiest scenes or whatever pish. 

Get to see this flat again tomorrow, this time Kev will be accompanying us. My maw, bro and sis fuck off to Blackpool for a few days, so it's just me and my da in the house. Think I'm going out one night with Ralston and Lisa Goldie this week as well. Will need to budget for moving out but.

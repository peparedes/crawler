In general, you are a very cautious and reserved person.
However, you are also warm hearted, and you enjoy helping others in practical ways.
You are a great teacher, and you are really good at helping people get their lives in order.
You are very intuitive, and you go with your gut. You make good decisions easily.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatmythologicalcreatureareyouquiz/"">What Mythological Creature Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Yeah so for the past 4 days I've been at my dads, and playing poker, thats been working out for me, my game has been pretty good too.  I havn't been online since then so this is relief from the great outdoors, aka my dads place. Also, I really want to be in Texas right now, cuz Mara is the best.  But that is quite a hard thing to accomplish, although it will be accomplished, eventually.  So thats whats on my mind pretty much. 

Sincerely,
         Jeremy"

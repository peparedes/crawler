It all happened pretty quick but i have been over this fucking town for awhile now just finally grew the balls to do something about it. Im going back to family and friends and an amazing boy who by the way... did like me (refer to prior post). Right now im pretty fucking happy, yes i do know its going to be cold but i managed it there for 21 before i think i can do it again. Thats about all i have to say  besides im totally excited to get on with the next phase of my life. Bye Bye to all i met while here, not that i even talk to any of you now."

Neither place i truly WANT to work at but beggars cannot be choosers they say and i'm about 1 step away from begging on street corners for change. So hopefully one if not both of these places work out for me."

"event","So today has been strange at best to say, First i will give you a brief recap. I moved here 1200 miles away from my family that lives in Michigan/Ohio area and have kept little to no contact with them for about 3 years so far. Today i get a letter from my grandparents that i havent even really spoke with for years prior to my move telling me about their Lexus, 2 spot camping lot w/ stretch golf cart to drive around and their 2 times a week bowling leagues..... That enough would have been enough family contact to last me threw the holidays but we arent nearly done yet. Phone rings its a area code and number i dont know so i answer it the lady on the other end says ""Is Halie there?"" i reply ""This is"" followed by that line we all love when the phone rings and we dont know who the hell it is, ""Do you know who this is?""  my reply ""Not a clue"".... It was my Aunt Shirley from Michigan, This actually pleased me out of my entire family that includes over 25 cousins and even more aunts and uncles these are the only ones i actually think about more then once a year. Growing up i was raised with them pretty much they have 1 daughter a few years older then myself and 2 twin boys that are my age. All good family memories involve this section of the family. So i was happy to talk with her and find out how everyone was doing. My cousin Josh i had already known had been sent to Iraq at the start of the war so i had been worried about him alot. All is well with them good news, Until she gets another call and places me on hold. A few short minutes later she comes back and is like ""What are the odds of this"" and procedes to tell me that the call on the other line was from Ohio and my Uncle Scott was just life flighted to the hospital after a factory accident involving his clothes getting stuck and him drug threw a large machine. She lets me go so she can talk with them and get all the details. When she calls back she tells me what happend and that they think he will be ok but he has lost alot of skin and blood but lucky his clothes ripped off of it would have been alot worse. So we chat a bit longer and exchange contact info so we can keep in touch. After i hang up with her i figure i should call my father to make sure he knows about this seeing at it is his brother Scott that he is close to and actually works acrossed the street from. As i call y dad he was already on the way out the door because he was told at work, he says he actually saw the life flight helicopter land acrossed the street and knew some one was being transported but had no ideal it was his brother. Today has been crazy and all teh more reassures my theories that everyone in the Lambert family has ESP. Anytime there is any family contact its like this for me and people wonder why i dont answer my phone.... Now i think to cap off the day i will call my mother i mean hell its already a record amount of family members i spoke with today i should finish off the list with her. Wish me luck!"

""All the votes have been stolen, this was rigged, it doesn't make a difference, the man always fucks us""... Blah Blah Blah. Get the fuck over it, deal with it. Kerry gave a nice little speech and carried himself with dignity, and threw in the towel  when he knew that he wasnt the better man for the job.

Third band (Bad Religion)= Good.... i dont really listen to them so i dont know any of the music but it was tight and kept people moving so i guess thats all you need. END. The night before i got to hang out with Mike, Rich & Lelia, & Tony. We went to Wills had a few drinks, played a little pool, listend to some music....Good times all around.

Today was really awesome i have watched a shit load of Dvd's (Ghost in the shell, Angel Sanctuary, 8 mile,... something else i forgot already.)

I got out of bed after hitting snooze a million times.

I feel full, i just ate too much Mac & Cheese.

I'm so totally awesome (& bored).

Last night I had to ..... i dont remember what i did last night, but i know it wasnt too exciteing.

I want to tell the world that I'm gay.

I am making this journal friends only because I don't want the world to read what I'm writing, even though I'm posting it on the internet.

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Now fuck off....

I want to say thanks to Myself for always being there when i need some one to talk to..

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you that you will die from AIDS like every other scene whore.

DUDE!!!! (i got nothing... sorry.).

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with this thought - sharing your life with strangers on the internet is the cheapest form of therapy available. Leave a comment and tell me I'm beautiful.

Everything seems so ""watered down"" so pointless anymore, days and weeks pass by so quickly without any real advancement in my life. I'm stuck at a point where i do not know what to do anymore. I think about the past and think maybe i made bad choices sometimes, other times i know i did everything as i should have. I have been thinking alot lately about just giving up and going ""home"" (Ohio), but i have less there then i do here really. Nothing is clear all the lines are blurry and feelings are smeared together. I cant tell happy from sad, i cant tell if i miss certain points in time of my life or if i am glad they are done and over with. Theres people that i would give anything in the world to have here with me right now, but when they are around all i want is to be alone. I cant do this any more i cant ""live"" like this... I cant count the amount of times i have cried myself to sleep and all the lost hours i have spent in this state of mind. I have always been depressed, maybe i just was'nt meant to be..... anything."

I like to piss people off, i like to make for akward situations, i like to keep people on their toes. Its amazing how much damage one can cause without any intent."

Getting on with my life.</b></font><p>So alot of this shitty things have been happening to me lately in my life, Broken car, no money, getting sick, things like that. Also people have really been letting me down alot, I do not have many people that i really call ""Friends"" but the ones i do i hold close to my heart and i try to be there for. This same respect does not seem to be given to me... Like i go out of my way to do things they ask and then they don't seem to care, i ask for a favor they have too much other shit to do that they don't even remember i asked. Fuck it!! I'm done now, this is as pointless as they are.. Goodbye my dearest."

"event","Holy crap! its been along time since i updated this shit... of course i have nothing really to say still... I am moving within the next few days into a new house, i still have the same job, my car still sucks alot, i still have horrible luck with the boys. On the topic of boys, So its kinda like being a teenager and having a crush on a boy you know you will never get, there is a kid who i ""like"" or what ever you call it... He is not aware of this and most likely never will know because i am too shy and to afraid he will think i'm a retard to even let him have a clue about it. So like all the years growing up when i liked a boy i will just stand in the background and be the ""friend"". BLAHH, i hate having zero self esteem and i hate that boys only want the dumb easy girls. Oh well. Maybe i should just go up and grab his booty?? no probably wont work but i saw it happen in a movie once.... So what else do i have to talk about... i guess nothing...."

"event","Today was pretty good to be honest... i worked only for a few hours and made some good tips, i came home and i did my laundry and just sat around and was lazy for a few hours. After that i took a shower and threw myself together. I hung out with the ex-boy tonight it was pretty enjoyable, we just drove around for awhile trying to think of what to do then ended up at some wing place and ate some wings and chatted. We ended up going and jumpin the fence to the pool in the apartment complex we used to live in and went swimming and sat in the hot tub. It was nice seeing him and getting along with him, even tho we have so many reasons to be all pissy and bitchy to each other its still nice to put all that aside and just have fun every once in awhile. He has drama in his life he needs to deal with and get his shit together, my life is no better really so i cant tell him what to do. Anyways, it was a OK day all in all and now i will try to pass out because my sleeping medication is kickin in... Oh yea and there is a scary spider i keep seeing crawling around on my desk.. ICK!"

I think im breaking, it has been along time since this has happened, it is almost a comfortable feeling is a sadistic way. I remember the feeling and the sight of blood running over pale white skin, i remember laying in the fetal position crying until i passed out, i remember screaming until my throat swelled shut, i remember everything you ever said to me... i remember swallowing pills just to try to take the feeling of everything else away.. all of that sounds much better then the way i feel right now... i think a visit to the bathroom floor is well needed..."

"event","Well yesterday i woke up in the most pain i have ever felt in my life.. i was pukeing and really hot feeling an felt all dizzy... it was scary. So i called Mike and he came home from school and took me to the hospital, after being there for 7 hours and them pokeing me all all kinds of needles and giving me X-Rays, Cat scans & an a Pelvic exam they figure out i have kidney stones.... So needless to say this has not been a fun past 2 days, they gave me a bottle of Percocets tho so thats always a plus... i went to work today and came home after 4pm and thought that i should take a nap.. i just woke up 7 hours later from my ""nap""... So now im going to have to try to sleep somehow again and get up to go to work in the morning.. this will be fun.. Well im going to get going for now i guess i kinda feel like crap ad im a bit sad..."

Simon and i went out last night to Backbooth and met a few people he knows... it was ok i guess i did alot of standing around and looking miserable like i normally do when i go out... We had no luck on ""Gettin the bitches"".. not very good quality to select from, well at least in guys, there was all kinda of skanky hoes there not many hottie men though... not really any at all that i remember actually besides maybe one.. and it could have just been the dark lighting that was working for him... i dont think it would be easy for me to find a guy i think is a hottie, they have a alot to follow after... take that how you want it, i know what i mean.. Well i need a nap i think im getting cranky.. Fuck off bitches.. XOXO"

I'm sleeping alone, and at that my brain is catapulted into the present time... it is a really unnerving feeling to lay there in the dark for a few minutes after-wards listening to my spastic heart beat... Why am i telling you this??"

A few people came over, some of them drank a lil bit i did alot of walking around the apartment in circles.... I worked out trading days at work with Richard so i can ride with Mike to FT. Lauderdale so we can Drop off Art and pick up Melissa... only catch is i have to go to work between 5pm and 6:30pm tonight until Richard can get into cover my shift... So i guess i need to go get ready for that whole hour and a half at work.. Great fun. I have not ever been to South Florida yet so this should be an experience i guess....."

Oh yea my job is super wack i think im going to get a new one, My car is also a piece of shit so i hope it doesn't break long enough for me to get a new job and money to fix it or just buy a new one. My mind is a huge jumbled mess that i refuse to let slow down to process things right now.... im not overly depressed, im not really happy... im not really anything anymore... it is also way too late/early for me to still be awake but the couch just is not looking to comfy to sleep on right now... ugggh."

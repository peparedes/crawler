Well the lady said that I'd have to wait til next week cuz there's too many trees down in the route. So I'm gunno do it Monday morning before I go to school, I'll only miss about half of 1st hour.

I got volunteered to go to Sarah and Josh's to help Sarah move. That was okay. We stopped by Blockbuster the way home and got The Ring Two and Lords of Dogtown. The Ring was pretty good, I haven't watched the other.

Ever seen those real big, nice computer desks they have on display at Walmart? Yeah I put one of those together in like 5 hours. It wasnt for me though, unfortunately. 

Then I got stoned with Josh and watched The Ring, his ass fell asleep. Then Jamie called about 1:00 and we fought most the hour and a half that we talked. Mainly because I was tired as fuck and grumpy as shit. 

THAT WAS MY DAY. WHEEEEEEEEEEE."

"event","The idea hit me like a ton of fucking bricks. I don't have a title yet, so don't ask. Let me know what yall think though. Here's chapter 1. Enjoy!

	The morning was frigid and still as Christine waited on the balcony for the coffee pot to finish brewing. It was 2 a.m. and the young accountant was still up calculating figures on the Ballards' tax forms. It had been years since she'd had a ""full night's sleep."" That term was foriegn to her these days, ever since the incident that had happened 7 years before.

	Christine walked back inside, grabbed a mug from the cabinet and fixed her coffee. Coffee in hand, she went back to her office and sat down at her desk. She took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes which stung with dryness. As she picked up her pencil to start back on the forms, she heard a movement from the bedroom. She got up and went to the doorway. A woman in nothing but a wifebeater and a pair of bikini underwear was curled up in ball on the bed, the covers lying at the footboard.

	As she went to pull the covers over her lover,Beth, Christine noticed that her hands were shaking. She thought to herself, the work can wait, and she turned off the lamp and climbed into bed. 

	Beth rolled over and snuggled up to Christine. ""You're coming to bed early tonight,"" Beth said in sleepy voice.

	""Did you miss me?"" Christine replied.

	""Like hell,"" said Beth, then began to make a trail of soft kisses up Christine's neck.

	Christine slowly moved further down the bed so that she was face-to-face with Beth. She softly cupped Beth's face within her hands and began to kiss her lips gently. Beth gave out a soft sigh as one of Christine's hands moved slowly from her face to up Beth's wifebeater. Christine gently bit Beth's bottom lip then with her other hand pulled the undershirt up and over Beth's head then tossed it across the room.

	Beth leaned over and began to nibble on Christine's ear. ""I
love you,"" she whispered. Christine trembled and let out a sigh, ""I love you."" 

	Beth giggled as she straddled Christine then started unbuttoning her shirt. Christine leaned up so that her lover could take it off. Beth put her arm around Christine's back and with the other hand took off her shirt and threw it across the room. She pushed Christine back on the bed and with one hand pulled down her boxers.

	Christine put her hand on the back of Beth's neck and pulled her in to kiss her. She then wrapped her other arm around Beth, picked her up, threw her, back down, on the bed.

	""Ohhhh,"" Beth sighed, ""Looks like it's like that tonight, huh? Well-."" The phone rang.

	""Shit!"" they both said simultaniously, knowing who it was and what they were going to say.

	Beth leaned over and picked up the phone, ""Hello? Okay, I'm on my way.""

	Christine gave out a sigh and sat up against the headboard. She knew the drill. Beth worked at a hospital and as a specialty sergeon and was occasionally called in for emergency surgery.

	""Ohhh, I'm sorry sweetie. You know how it is,"" Beth said apologetically.

	""I know babe,"" Christine replied.

	While Beth was getting dressed, Christine put on her robe and fixed Beth a ""to go"" cup of coffee and made a fresh cup for herself.

	Beth came up behind Christine and wrapped her arms around her. Christine turned around and they stood there for a second wrapped up in each other's arms.

	""Try to get some sleep, okay?"" Beth pleaded.

	""I will,"" Christine replied.

	Beth kissed her lover on the forehead, ""I love you."" And at that she left.

	Christine took her coffee and went into her office. She sat down at her desk and was going to resume working, but by this time she was too tired and too horny to do anything. So, she decided to take a cold shower and go to bed. And that's just what she did.

	Thank God it's Saturday, she thought, as she drifted off to sleep to the sweet smell of Beth on her pillow."

We've only got once chance to put this at in end<br>

and cross the patron saint of switchblade fights<br>

You said we're not celebrities, we spark and fade, they die by threes<br>

I'll make you understand and you can trade me for an apparition<br>

<br>

Stand up fucking tall<br>

Don't let them see your back<br>

Take my fucking hand<br>

and never ....<br>

Trust, you said<br>

Who put the words in your head<br>

Oh how wrong we were to think<br>

That immortality meant never dying<br>

Stand...<br>

"event","yes, it has been awhile. Nothing much has been going on i guess. Just trying to survive these last few weeks before summer (thank goddess ^_^). Basically it's been sleep, homework, a&m forum, and FFIX. That's been all that I've been doing. I don't know which of the three (sleep, forum, or FFIX) I'm addicted to more at the moment. Oh well.

Steph: I'm glad prom was half-decent...you'll have to give me the details ;)

Wow. So Jamie came over Friday. Come to find out, she knew about everything for about week. My party was saturday. I was sooooo surprised. Everything was spongebob :D  There was steph, jamie 1, jamie 2, mrs trish, stephanie, charles, damon, lauren, shanna, gary, josh, courtney, maw maw, amanda, aunt denise, hannah, and the parents. wow. I got an aquarium, stuff for it, $57 altogether, a big 4-wick candle, a spongebob, eva lamp, a spongebob plush talking doll thing, and the dvd alex & emma, which I got from Jamie. It was the movie that basicaly got us together (to make a long story short). Then I went over to Stephanie's (with jamie!!!) and got drunk off my ass. So in conclusion, I got surprised, a bunch of shit, and got to spend the whole weekend with my baby and my friends.

Today I went to my new psychiatrist. Now I'm on Lexapro."

And here I am I can't sleep cuz i'm sick as a dog. Coughing up shit, sneezing, eyes watering...and listening to Jamie snore. Yes she's here, to my surprise. First I dint know if I was having a party, and then I had it all planned out, now I have no idea about any of it. My dad's been calling my friends for my surprise b-day party, but apparently, as I've been told, ""I dont know shit"". Well I hope that you, steph and you jamie are here, but I dunno.

Jamie had to bake a cake for food and nutrition, and she made a spongebob one. Tonight there was another surprise, she brought it and it was lit and looked so good. It was amazing. So far I really have been surprised a couple of times. Who knows, apparently they've (dad and jamie) been planning this for about a week now, so they've done okay so far. who knows what's next?"

"event","well today was an okay day. I was tired as hell. I'm invited to go to ""pass day"" which is alot like the way ""field day"" used to be at Poland. So the day trudged on. The highlight of my day was after school. It was the kinda of shit that you see in the movies and it never happens to me. I was waiting for the bus and kristin speeds up in front of me with her fine ass car and her loud ass slipknot blarin', everyone is lookin, she smiles at me, and I literally hop in. It was so cool. I made up some shit to my parents saying that we got out of 8th hour late and I missed the bus. HA HA. So now I'm starving and doing three loads of clothes. One for paw paw, so i can get ""a couple of bucks""

Then yesterday, deanna her husband and 6 kids, josh and sarah and chris, rhonda and sammy, aunt patti, uncle dennis, patrick and dean, aunt irlene and uncle mike, aunt ethel and her husband, and  two other old folks were ALL over here for the fish fry. It turned out really good, it would have been alot better if jamie were here. I've realized family get-togethers are easier with cute girlfriends to calm you down. So all that and me cleaning and helping and talking and drinking (surprisingly..mudslides). Went to bed about 1:00, woke up about 8:00 this morning. Did more cleaning and cooking and being bored today. I watched Brown Sugar. I love that movie. I took a cat nap, then got up and cleaned, cooked, ate, then cleaned up from the cooking. I think unless your happily married and enjoy your partner popping you with a wet towel and help you clean up (which leads to hot sex :D), the one who cooks SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP. Whatever...watching charmed now."

He sat on my bed and was crying. He said he had been talking to Dewana all day, and he dont think it'll go that far. I hope not. She is leaving this evening and coming back tomorrow cuz we're having a fish fry and she dont want to be around all the drinking, but daddy wont be drinking, i promise you that.

"event","I really dont feel like living anymore. Which  I knwo this isnt the first time, and thats bad, but damn. I hate the fact that my life changes as fast as my undies do. Everything is falling apart. My dad is drinking again. I hate his guts right now and I have no guts to sit down and attempt to talk some sense into him. Dewana maybe leaving him, and I cant handle that. I feel like an adult sometimes already, I dont need or want to be the parent. Plus the fact that Dewana has been more of a mom to me than my own biological mother. School days just get longer and longer. Everything I'm dealing with I'm taking it out on Jamie. The mentor who I love  more than I have any teacher might be leaving, and thats going to kill me. I have 2 more years of all this shit, and the big bombshell has to hit right when everything I've wanted to come into play has started. I'm turning 16, getting a license, a car, a job, a junior. I cant come home without a mom, or have to worry about paying bills and doing ALL of the housework plus wonder if my dad is drunk or dead. The only thing keeping me going is my goals. Goals of getting out of here, having a life of my own. I'm losing steph and its not the first time but i think it may be the last. We never talk or see each other any more. We have no clue whats going on in eachother's life except for what we read on here. I dont know if I'm going to make it. I'm going to see a new shrink on the 25th, whatever good thats gunno do. He'll prolly just give me some pills to either make me not care or make me more suicidal. I never understood that. THEY SUBSCRIBE YOU MEDICENE FOR DEPRESSION, BUT IT INCREASES SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. What the fuck is up with that. Whatever."

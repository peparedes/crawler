"event","Well, I've gotten some good news this past week, lets start with the basics, Me, Will, My Mom and the fat ass (Pete my moms boy friend) are moving in like a month or two. Were still staying in Marblehead but were finally after 8 or 9 years of living here were buying a house rather than leasing, were moving behind the new brickhouse so thats pretty sweet, and some other news is that My Sister is coming up from florida to see the rest of the fam and i havent seen her in 4 years so im pretty excited for that. Atreyu, From First To Last, Everytime I Die, and Chiodos is on tour in the states in the fall so ill be going to see them too, and a band at the complex left a sweet guitar and i get to take it, its a Schecter C-1 Artist which are $700 guitars that im getting free so yeah, and i talked to a person that i havent talked to since she moved like a month ago, Serissa left me a comment on myspace and its always good hearing from her and trey, i love them two...i dont know about the other one but serissa and trey are cool with me and during the school year ill be visiting my sister and my nephews Tyler and Jordan, the funny things are with that is that they live in the same town as serissa and trey which is palm bay florida so maybe ill run into a certain person...i was thinking that it would be fucking awesome if Trey and Jordan who are the same ages were good friends hahaha, i dont know hopfully they arent enemies... well thats it for now....ill update later on

P.S. WARPED TOUR WAS AMAZING

"event","Well today was a long day, I was supposed to go to my dads house but i ended up going to my brother's college orentation. so this is how it began, i woke up at 6 in the morning, threw on some clothes and then jumped into my jeep with Will, my mom and fatass (Pete). He dropped us off in Lynn at my grandparents house and then i ate some breakfast there and then we were on our voyage to the new hampshire institute of art in manchester, new hampshire. when we got there it basically looked like boston, the town was run-down and wicked populated, but i all of sudden got this urge and i really want to go to college and get away from marblehead and make new friends and then end up just staying in the state that i attend college in, which in this case i want to go to University of Hartford Connecticut, and i want to live there after college, but back to my day, me my mom and my grandmother stayed in manchester for fucking 8 hours waiting for wills oreintation to get over, but the town was pretty sweet....madd ladies, and a lot of shit to do, and i was just thinking that i have one more fucking year in this shithole of a town and then im gone, im leaving everyone, severing my ties and never coming back and i mean never, i cant stand all the fucking drama that occurs in the small shithole, its really like fucking laguna beach but theres not that hott of chicks, i mean dont get me wrong there are a handfull at the most of chicks in this town but thats it. But theres sooooo much drama and i hate drama and so when i leave hopfully the drama stays behind me...i really need to seek thearpy or counciling because i have sooo much to say but i draw the line when what im writing is posted on the public internet, whatever, i really dont care anymore, people can read this comment and just give me shit for all i care, but theres nothing left in this town for me anymore...

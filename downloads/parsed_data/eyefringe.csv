She decided to tell me this on a particularly curvy road behind a turning car. On went the brakes, off goes the Slut. And in goes Emily, into the steering wheel that is. Smunch. Me, the guy who's paint is all over my bumper, and the friendly neighborhood witness all pull off the road to discuss Slut's antics. I give him my info and he tells me, very politely, it might be cheaper to replace my tires than pay $1000 to fix the next bumper I smash into. 
Now I've got a headache, a neckache, and my shoulders and back are killing me. Why must my Slut hate me so???"

I'm really busy now, ridiculously so, and school is hard and maybe I'm not feeling so confident and I am frusterated by everything. I am overwhelmed and not coping well. 

I've never felt like an idiot before. I've always been on the smarter side of the classroom, but leave it to literary fucking theory to make me look like a... I don't even have a word. Imbicile? Knuckle head? Dunce. If I'm not good at my work, and I'm not good at school, and I'm not particularly funny or social, and my art has become redundant...

really, what else is there. 

So here is me being passive agressive and non-confrontational and weak. Here are all my negative qualities. And maybe if I write it it won't be as true, and I won't have to think about it any more, and I won't have to be humiliated by saying it. I miss you more than I will ever admit out loud. I don't call because I am embarrassed. I am always embarrassed by you. I'm trying to work on that. Knowing it wouldn't work logically has yet to stop the ridiculous affections I have for you, even when they are twisted, and they're starting to wear on me."

"event","Last night, or was it early morning, I stood on the edge of a bridge with a boy I barely knew looking down over traffic. We shivered and heaved through our lungs, he turned his shoulders to the wind and I waited for a gust to knock me down. It was funny, but I told him my idea of beginnings. He told me about his solitude, his love of independence. I told him he'd look good with a scarf and he laughed. This boy I barely knew, he called me brave, and I looked at the stars and I saw Cassiopea sitting upside down, and I wondered, what do we look like? Why do I find myself, spring after spring, stinking of desperation and asking the sky to solve my problems? This boy, I looked in his eyes, I saw a fleck of myself there, a hint of recogniton and understanding, and later while we watched the sleeping dream our smiles were mutual. He has called me a kodak moment; I call him unjudgeable, scared, learning, defiant, beautiful. Cosmic. 
   I feel like... a lego tower. Or a building made of blocks. I feel like I've been knocked over for so long and I've forgotten all about myself. Forgotten how to write, how to look upwards, how to... I don't know. Breathe. Appreciate myself. Appreciate everyone else. I can look at this boy I don't know and look at this other boy I know so well, see myself in both of them, see pieces of all of us all wound up together, and I can still remember thoughtful touches and still have those quiet connections and still see everything precious, everything glowing. 
   I need quiet, I need thoughtful, I need to be outside collecting myself. Maybe desperation isn't such a bad thing, and maybe it's necesarry, maybe wanting to laugh and cry and fight all in one can make something amazing, make me get out of bed, make me try. 
   I don't know what I want.... I just know I want."

Besides this I plan on having myself bound in suspenders, ties, bras, panties, and any other gender-specific clothing items that can be tied to me. Basically, me playing gender Houdini.

Sound like fun?

TEXT:
Is this my definition. 
	Shuffled into the classifications of words, nouns and verbs, 
	divided and derived, simplified. 
	Just a tiny mark in the land of shes and hes,
	her and him and it and they.
	Daily, tallied and accounted for by
	whether you can see my breasts,
	if I'm packing heat,
	the cut of pants, 
	the way I move my hands.
	It goes beyond who I want to fuck,
	but stops just short on the dumb assumption
	that we can be divided,
	shoved like sloppy little messes into
	the binary convention. 
	Some days I smile, play along.
	I'm a boy, 
	loose jeans and duck butt hair, my binder tight and boxers sagged,
	shoulders back and
	voice dropped low,
	trying to be one of the guys.
	I'm a girl, all done up in a skirt and heels, wearing a bra,
	wearing makeup,
	talking women's rights and menstrual cycles,
	feeling fake. 
	I'm neither but it seems no one accepts that,
	seems too easy to announce yourself anatomically incorrect,
	a perpetual doll stuck somewhere between Ken and Barbie,
	all plastic and unreal.
	I'm both, both real and fake, both boy and girl,
	 and trying to say that has got me all tied up inside out,
	bound in a pronoun net,
	every day a name change,
	every day a slightly different face. 
	I'm everything all piled up into an inconvenient body,
	hating and loving my
	clumsy stumblings into these gendered boxes,
	these strangely rigid terms.
	

Don't know how to finish it yet. Don't know how to say what I'm thinking. Don't even know what I'm thinking. I couldn't sleep hardly at all last night, and today I'm still wide awake, even though I'm so physically and emotionally exhausted. My muscles are tight, bones tired. I want a bed that's ten feet wide. Argh."

I can't remember the last time I saw that guy, that poor kid who I hated feverently for so long, and now can't understand why I did. I mean, I've still got the basics, but I guess I have him to thank for all of this, in some twisted fucked up way. Er, thanks for the blackmail? Thanks for the emotional deciet? I actually still have that letter you wrote me with all its misspellings and non sensical sentences and heart inflating compilments. It's actually the only thing I really miss in Minnesota, possession wise, and I have to remember it when I go back there. It's a good memory of you, since I conveniently burned all the bad ones. 
I wonder how much of your judgement of me was true. If I've changed. Maybe someday I'll see you again and we can talk. It would be interesting to see who you really are.

I don't understand why this is bothering me so much lately. I remember years of wearing that shit. Putting on eyeliner in the mornings. Layering skirts. Why am I falling apart over it now?

At the end of rehearsal today a bunch of girls took off their tops and just hopped around, twirling their boobs, being rediculous. I realized I would never do that, not because I'm shy or bashful, but because of the genuine hatred I have for these things that have grown out of me. 

Technically for Vag mons, I could have worn pants and flat shoes and little to no makeup. Me doing it is me trying to prove I can, I think. But it's also me saying how ridiculous I feel. 

Sorry this has become such a directed outlet lately. I'm just... anxious? upset? frusterated. I can say it every day for a year, and be really repetitve, but I've got this great thing about compulsive thought and obsessions and right now, this is it. This is what I spend my day obsessing about and brooding over. 

My quote of the week comes from my boss. This kid and I at work both have similar philosophies and practices in gender, and when he called us girls, we got a bit upset. He responded with, ""What? When I see an elephant, I call it an elephant.""

Anything to keep me busy, basically, my living room is littered with plastic bags for class and I spend my evenings stitching them together. 
  Rehearsed my touch piece today, all tights and lace and white fabrics. Suddenly I'm seeing myself through the camera, and wondering, am I always playing a part? I carry so many different costumes, every day. 
   I'm thinking the most childish things. Temper tantrums, time travel, rasberries and soap bubbles, hiding under blankets with flashlights. In my five year old state, no wonder I leave everyone frusterated. No wonder I continually come off as a tease. I play and giggle and joke and tease, and no one is making me be serious. It's easy, being the goof. It isn't real and it doesn't matter and it's fucking easy.
   I'm supposed to be journalling and diarying and so forth, thinking about the past, which I don't like doing on principle. Now that I look at it, though, I realize it's been a long time since I wrote about being a kid and the story didn't revolve around my father. It seems to be a theme in my life. He does, at least. And it's an excuse, isn't it? It's ok that I'm a fuck up, just look at this. Look at my life. It's a fucking excuse and I'm sick of it. 
  I need to let things go. I need the broken things to just be broken, instead of tearing everything else down with them. One person doesn't justify a lifetime of other people.

     As disturbed as I am by these events, they're not the things making my stomach flip. I don't mind dressing up so much because I'm playing a part, I'm pretending to be someone else. This other person just happens to be a traditional, socially acceptable female. I can leave my own gender values in the dressing room. The thing that bothers me is my bio, which I had to write and turn in. Lately I've been getting angry at pronouns, and looking at this bio where She is thrown about, I just don't feel right. I'd be equally uncomfortable referring to myself as He, I would imagine, and since I'm against the ridiculous world of ze and zim, I'm left with referring to myself as It. Or Emily, or Emma, and so on. The elusive ""they"". 
   Being in Vag Mon's is awkward enough because as sweet as these girls are, I feel completely seperate from them. They talk about women and rights and oppression and I can smile and nod but ultimetely, I don't associate myself with any of those issues. Every friday I go and I sit and I lie, politely, about who I am. I've been doing research into the technical rules of the monologues, the ideas about men and gender non-conformists being involved, and while it doesn't seem like a huge deal it's still something that has been brought up and discussed. 
   I don't really know what I'm trying to get at. Maybe I'm asking for a new word, a new pronoun, something just for me. Maybe this is me fighting back against those girls who giggle and hug me. The weekly question of which pronoun or identity I want. 
  I'm just trying to say, I don't want any at all. K?"

  I just want to do everything! Which makes it impossible to do anything. I want to be done with school, I want to always be in school, I want to go to graduate school, I want a theatre internship, I want a professional gig! I want to live somewhere where I can have everyone I love around me. I want to live on my own. I want to travel. I want to write.

 I went shopping with a friend for costumes and paint for an art installation we're putting together, and for this we need tight white clothing. First to Target, where we browse the discount clothing racks and we coo over various oh so cheap, oh so cute clothing items. I find some button ups, she finds some dresses, we try on neither. We manage to find some cheap white shirts - I take particular pleasure in finding mine in the little boys section. On to the dressing rooms, and I get the slightly confused double take while headed for the girls side. Momentarily I am confused, and then I remember....

I look paricularly boyish today. More so than usual. Baggy jeans, sweat shirt, farmer ted coat complete with fleece inside. Not to mention my brand new hair cut, which ranges from ken-doll to brad pitt to that amazing lost hair style of the 90s, the duck bill. 

Now all I need is frosted tips. 

Anyway. We get the shirts and head to the mall, because apparently there are white leggings at rave. I have never been inside ""rave"". It sounds a little frightening. Though the teenage girls who work there are too busy text messaging to notice us, the store itself offers an array of horrifying apparel. Such as....

White leggings. We find them and I throw a small hissy fit, because these leggings have lace on them. I know I can cut them off, but still. White lace. When we go to try them on, I realize with horror that I'm wearing boxers.

May I just say, boxers and leggings, which are basically tights that cost more, do NOT go well together? I looked like I had a diaper on. When I came out of the dressing room to show my friend this, we both had to laugh at how awkward I looked, all boxer diapers and leg hair and lace. 

The evening concluded we me attempting to coax her out of the department store, silently choking on the array of perfumes as she showed me china patterns and the designer handbags. I love her to death, I really do, but I realize now it's been a long time since I've been inside a mall with a straight woman. 

In conclusion... I have a little boy's turtle neck and slutty lace leggings hiding under my bed, along with fingerpaints. I think those three items pretty much sumarize my life right now."

So much potential, and I really don't feel like doing anything. I'm frusterated and hurt and completely unable to express myself. Which comes off as me, annoyed at nothing.

I know I'm not a lot of fucking fun all of the time. This is kind of who I am though. You know, me? 

I haven't felt this insecure since middle school. 

I found myself yesterday literally snapped back in time, playing that old part that I have since grown out of. It's only been a recent revelation that I don't have to be the waiter all the time. I don't have to wait for anyone. In fact, I've just about had my fill of waiting. But now I'm wondering if all the friends I've had have only been there because of who I was to them, what I provided. I handled all of their shit like a fucking personal assistant. I waited, listened, coddled, and counciled. I've done that, and I'm done. I don't want to just take care of you anymore. I think it's fair to say, can't I get some attention too?

I have, what, five days left here? They're stretching on forever. I wish I could get fucked up and stay fucked up just to make the time pass. That or sleep through it. Am I a bad kid, saying I fucking hate my home? Saying that I can't be here without driving myself crazy.  Maybe I'm just tired of everyone here treating me like I'm shit. Guess it took me moving away to realize that I'm not shit - only problem is, now I'm all indignant and, apparently, selfish/snotty/horrible."

In front of me, along the walls,
paper cutouts of elementary school craft are taped up,
their paper faded,
their signatures blurry and soft.
Construction paper antlers fold like wilting leaves,
it appears,
as I am getting older.
And what about glitter glue?
Is is glitter? Is it glue? Or is it neither and I am just naive.
Give me answers.
Tell me why I can't just let this go,
why I google the people I want out of my life, still,
why I want to know what they're doing.
What is the importance of a father?
Really, how much damage can one single person do.
I'd like to take a potato peeler, 
or a cheese grater,
or maybe even a brisol scrubbing pad - 
I'd like to take these things to my skin,
drag them across my face and chest,
exfoliate my memories.
Because I know there are things more important than this.
I know there are things larger than one tiny sad little person who
can be such a dick.
Cosmos, universe, whatever the fuck is up there,
hold on a moment.
I have a question that I need answered.
Why can't bad people be bad people all the time?
Why do they still buy presents and lie and say I love you?
Such little things, but they're in my skin.
They're tunneling, forraging, they're turning my matter into rot.
If I don't offer forgiveness,
If I don't taken what is given to me with gratitude,
do I become the bad person?
Is it bad to think, or rather to know, that I will probably feel remorse when he is dead.
But not before.
And I will probably breathe easier, and find more room in my chest,
momentarily before the guilt starts seeping in. 
Oh, christmas.
The heater's on and I can hear the tinsel blowing, knocking so softly against
the plastic blinds and paper snowflakes,
and it sounds like fingernails against skin,
like someone scratching. 
Sleep will come like flutters, beating, diluted.
And I will lay, sweating cold, wrapped around my pillows, hands against the wall, eyes glazed. Fluttering.
Truth is it makes my blood run cold to be in this state and to not know where he is. 
And have him know exactly where I am.
Did I always dream like this, before? Have I always been this kid?
These are the questions I have for you."

waking me during the night,
maybe it's the miles,

I don't really know what right is.

I know that all of my options are scaring me. Growing up scares me. Staying a child scares me.
I have this picture, this weird little picture in my head that popped up one day when I was standing outside a stranger's door and it was so unlike the pictures I thought I'd be painting. 
Live for yourself. Seems simple enough. I live for myself everyday just by living, just by breathing. I breathe and I exceed all my previous expectations. I keep myself alive, happy and functioning, and in return, am I selfish?
Have I been raised to think that self-preservation is selfish?
Itching for a change. The bleach is there the scissors, should I be someone new? Varnish and gloss, distractions, expectations. Old clothes new clothes, my empty room, me. 
If I find the film would you find the time? what if what if. what if I want to live too many lives and be too many things, what if I don't get the chance to do or see any of it? 
what if.
I'm supposed to be home. this is supposed to be home. Why am I making all the calls, why do I make the plans and pick you up, why do I make the effort. It's still the same, two years later. She'll never drive to me. 
Not her fault. Not either of our faults. But I wish I could see her and tell her, you know those games we played? Do you know those lists and dreams we talked about? I met someone, and they're making them come true. Just tiny favors.

I grip the wheel too tight and lean close to the window, driving too slowly and too cautiously, and making the effort, because if I don't I'll keep driving like a maniac, daring the corners to outwit me.
I got mad at a deer the other day because it was just finishing crossing the road as I came tearing past. After having this reaction I was first startled, because  I like deer, and then incredibly alarmed. I hate this time of year, I hate what it does to me, I hate christmas trees and I hate christmas music. I'm reduced to a child, who can only say, I Hate. 
But, I don't only hate.
I feel like I go through my day freezing my ass off, building up these callouses of ice. And every evening, they drip away, and I'm clean again, myself.
It's getting colder every day, now. Some days it's sunny, and I just want to stand outside and soak it in, and keep it with me, peeking in on it in my pocket while it sleeps. 
My mind is full of sunflowers and papers, people I have to call, documents I have to sign. 
All of this obligation, and responsibility, and can't anyone see they're trusting all of these things to a child?

How much money? I have no idea. But it's more money than they can afford, and so, grants and proposals are supposedly being written, and begging being done, to rebudget the production so I can jump on board. I found out my beloved boss and mentor, Matt, has been hired, so he'll be working with Turner and Steve in Miami at least. I want to call them up and plead, 'take me! take meeeee! I'll work for freeeee!' Except I can't, because I'm broke. But please! I'll work for cheap!

In other news, my life is soaking in theatre. But that's not really new, right? I'm working a load in for the touring production of Evita, sound opping an Orissi dance performance, and was cast in the Vagina Monologues for the last monologue in the show, ""I was there in the room"", which I will be performing with another girl. I'm also doing an end-of-the-quarter performance/installation piece, which is taking up much of my free time and money. It's currently set up in the corner of my living room, earning strange looks from my roomate and her friends. I should hopefully be getting a crew of beloved friends to help me rehearse, since it's highly audience interactive, so if you're in Oly and reading this, please send me a message so I can recruit you! It would suck to find out, while performing, that the audience interactions didn't work. And considering that's a huge part of the performance, I'd be doubly fucked. Now all I have to do is grow gigantic balls to actually perform it...

I'm actually glad I'm ridiculously busy. This time of year is hell on earth, and I'm particularly not looking forward to this next year, aka, Dec.16-on. I still have medical paperwork to fill out for the 19th but I'm trying to ignore it, because if I ignore it I can't get nervous, and if I'm not nervous, I won't panic, right? The only thing I'm scared about is that I'm never been under anesthesia before. I have no idea if I'm allergic, or what I'm allergic to, and what if something happens? It's just four fucking teeth, but being unconcious is terrifying. And they're going to take my teeth. I like my teeth! 

Three hours and twenty two minutes until I leave to go to Sea Tec. Excited. Obviously, since I can't form a more complex sentence. My paper is done, my presentation thought out, and my head is still spinning with the millions of things I have to get done. I just want a moment that is still, a second where I can just breathe and feel like a whole person instead of shards of girlie, boyish, freak-out me. I didn't make the national novel writing goal of 50,000 words - I'm just over 40 pages though, and that's pretty good for me. More so, the story has ingrained itself in me and I find myself wanting to finish it, wanting to come to a point, wanting to explain everything with these two little characters. 

I don't have an ending. I saw some interesting grafitti though today in school; it said ""Today is the only beautiful day."" I don't know if I believe that, but it seemed appropriate, for now."

It's a tight rope walk, these days, this fall. It's rolling into winter and I'm loosing my balance, bracing myself against torn black borders, nude leotards, affection. Do my kisses surprise you? Why am I overheated and trembling? 

I met a guy named Sam who's decided, today, that he is going to be still. He is sitting in a tent in the rain, listening to the raindrops hit and roll down the tarp. I am amazed and astounded by everything; why am I so easily put in awe? I'm swinging between everything being astronomical and everything being fucked up. It's like my cosmic view is a glow-in-the-dark ball, and every now and then, when it looses it's glow, I find a drop box to put it in and it comes out all shiny and luminous. It's like everywhere, there are little tiny moments restoring my faith. Faith in what? It doesn't matter.

I have been lit on fire, punched and hit, cuddled, hugged, laughed at. It's weird to be seen, noticed, and taken into account. And it's still astounding that anyone in the world would go out of their way to see me, to have me in their life. No, I don't have a low self-worth. I'm settled into being second.

Basically, the story goes that I did some nude photography (OF HER) with my ex girlfriend a while back, using her camera, and I haven't gotten originals yet. Then today, upon talking I discover they're up on YouTube as a slide show.

Now, I'm not pissed, but I do feel very infringed upon creatively, and jess if you ever read this I want to make that clear, I'm not being passive aggressive by venting or whatever here, I just am curious because I genuinely adore those pictures and want to know if I have any rights over them. Because, frankly, I think they're just cheapened by being put on youtube. I want to use them in a collection, installation, or show, and I want to know if that's even possible.

Ok. Now that I got that out...

I know I stare alot.
In the car, on the porch,
I catch myself looking across this huge amount of space and thinking
I want you closer.
So I grab a finger or a corner of your clothing,
whine or mumble to myself, quietly, 
come here.
No laughs, no jokes.
I just want to stand close to you a moment.
I want to feel the combined warmth bouncing off our bodies and
the pulsing heartbeat tucked underneath your shirt.
I think our bodies are like circuit boards,
clumsied up and broken,
and I've got to find all the connections, now,
I need the shock and warmth and light of simple touch.

        ""Hey!""
        ""Tell me a story."" She lay down on his chest. Her nose, buried in the space between his ribs, snuffed and sniffled at his smells, the deororant and detergent and little flakes of skin. 
          ""What sort of story would you like?""
          ""A life story.""
           "" A life story."" The Jensen-lump rustled and puffed it's stomach out, and through the cotton weave it watched her head rise and fall. ""Ok. One day, I woke up at three in the morning, I set my alarm to wake up, I didn't just get up because I couldn't sleep. I took my blankets outside and I watched the stars fade away, and I watched the sun come up, and I watched it move across the sky all day long.""

       Sheila raked her fingers up until she brushed the lump's face. She untucked the sheet from behind it's head and pulled it down until his eyes appeared. Jensen blinked, and she tried to blink with him. ""I think they're grey.""
      ""Gray or grey.""
      ""What?""
      ""How would you spell it."" Jensen's eyes blinked again, fluttering their eyelids. His eyelashes brushed Sheila's nose. ""Spell my eyes for me.""
      ""Grey? Gray? G-R-E-I-A-Y-E.""

      ""You're very demanding.""

      ""I don't think you do."" Jensen's head wriggled out from the sheet until his nose appeared, his lips and chin. The head bobbed down, eyes squinted at her. ""You ask a lot of questions.""
    ""I'm curious.""
    ""So am I."" 
     ""So ask me something.""
     ""What do you want to tell me?"" 
    Sheila matched her blinks with his. She puckered her lips, she touched the end of her nose to his.
     ""Why are you touching me?"" 
      ""Because I want to.""
     Jensen's teeth nipped at her chin. ""Another reason.""
      ""Because I feel like it.""

       ""I want to feel connected."" Sheila placed her hand over a lumpy heart and felt the cotton beat. ""I want to be...""
        ""I want to be a part of something bigger,"" Jensen said. ""I want to feel what everyone else is feeling, like I have nerve endings rooted in your skin.""
        ""I want to not feel alone.""
       Jensen sat up and watched Sheila melt into a puddle, settled in his lap. He brushed her muddy hair through his fingers. He put them under her chin and found her pulse, and pushed back with every tiny throb he felt.  ""Look, we're a circuit.""
       Sheila's lips curled. She pushed them down and shook the happy from her face and watched her hand move, the smallest beat, as her blinks matched his heart and his hand. 
         ""Don't smile.""

"event","I have decided to do the novel-in-a-month challange, and realized something horrifying: I have no fucking clue what to write about. No characters, no plot, not even a silly little scenario to start from. I'm terrified I'm going to take a piece of my life and use that, which would be both a cop out and a potentially very hurtful thing to do, as I have learned, to use direct events without fictionalizing them or the people involved. All I need is the bud of an idea,then I can let it spiral outwards. Someone, give me an idea!! Quick!!!

And now, onwards. Here's the poem that I memorized, want tattooed on my body, and will love forever ever.

""You do not have to be good.
You do not have to walk on your knees
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
You only have to let the soft animal of your body 
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile, the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are
moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clear blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting - 
over and over announcing your place
in the family of things.""

Isn't it pretty? So so pretty. Something alarming is happening to me - I can see my future, bright and clear, I look at my life and I smile. Well, okay, I look at my life two months from now and I wince, because against all better judgment and against you being as jerky as you can be, I still think about it. I still stumble into those conversations with you and I still laugh every time I get awkwardly introduced to another person who is such a part of your life. Why can't I just drag you into my life? Why am I continually embedding myself so deeply into other people, picking up their habits and their foods, speaking their language. I thought I was a chameleon but really I'm not blending in, I'm molding myself to whoever is in my life. So yeah, I'm fucking happy, I'm fucking ecstatic, but is it for the right reasons? 

There is one thing on my mind that I don't know how to handle, don't know how to explain, and feel so dumb about. I don't know how, nor want, to tell my mother about any of this. If she knew what I was going through, she'd think... I don't even know. It took her so fucking long to be alright with me, to accept my life and be comfortable talking about it, and I don't want her to regress or think it was just a phase because it's not, it's who I am! When I was younger I used to think about a gay person who fell in love with a straight person and thought, gee, ""coming in"" sure would be funny! 

Guess what : It's not funny. It blows language away. It isn't an issue until people start treating you differently because of it.

How do you tell your narrow minded, sweetly naive, blindly accepting mother, who has FINALLY become GLBT friendly, that you're falling for a boy?"

"event","Remember that show I was working on last week? Well, I might (very slight, but there's a chance...) get to go on tour with it when they head out in January. If that's the case, I'm going to try and get school credit PLUS get paid to travel around with a bunch of delightfully queer people and put on a show.

Oh, and Jen, did I mention the director Steve looks EXACTLY like Danny Elfman? Exactly. Like, when he walked in I asked him his name because I though it WAS him. Except he has grey hair, but hey, Danny's an old fart right? Riiiiight.

Did I have other news? I did! Sources tell me my photo is floating around somewhere in a lezzie magazine called Jane and Jane, so if anyone happens to stumble upon a copy before me, would you mind picking one up? I just think my mom would love having that framed... hahaha.

More news: there's a new love in my life and her name is Sheila. Sheila is a kitten that we got for free yesterday, who the other cat absolutely hates, but she's so cute! She screams bloody murder when you aren't around, and when you are she tries to eat your pants. Hilarious. I'll put a pic up eventually.

I meant for this to be a somewhat artistic, contemplative post, but I don't think there's enough time for that. I'm looking at my life right now and laughing, wincing, and shaking my head, because I don't know what the fuck is going on and I don't really care. What I do know is this: I've known you for a week, and I'm embarrassingly fond of you. I'm pathetically fond of you. So maybe I should say that to your face, instead of here, or maybe I can keep being sly and stealing kisses, but either way I'm setting myself up for a life-long, going-to-need-therapy, skin-buzzing sort of mind fuck. Because I realized that I like you for you, every bit, and it makes me smile to think of seeing you again.  

Shit, late for work. Oh well, it was worth it."

"event","This week I've been up to my elbows in the world premiere of a Trans one-man show at my school, sound and video oping, and I've gotten about 15 hours of sleep total. When I came into work this morning, my boss took me into his office and told me, very calmly, my job today is to nap in the green room and not die. So of course, I'm on here writing instead. :) But I'm getting paid 9 dollars an hour to do it - ah, the mysteries of life.

Other than the show, which is already spinning my head in soooo many different directions, I'm having... somewhat of an unexpected, personal identity crisis. You know how everyone has a what if situation, how we call ourselves 99.99% of something and never really expect to stumble across that one thing that defies everything about who we are, how we relate to people, and how we percieve ourselves. Well, imagine meeting that. Imagine looking someone right the fuck between the eyes and seeing exactly who they are, and instead of feeling whatever you'd usually feel you fucking admire them for it. 

I don't have time to be confused and go through this whole thing again, backwards. I don't have the emotional capabilities to play my sexual identity like a yo-yo.

On top of that, I've been forced to play the ""you think you know somebody"" game as of late with myself, and the more I think and the more I sort things out the less comfortable I feel, the more confused and hurt and misled, the more toyed with. It's impossible to pull the mirage off of the reality, because it's self-adheasive and my goo-off for paranoia doesn't work anymore. I don't know, really, if any of this is a mirage. Or if it all was. 

What defines ""healthy""? Who decides what is a proper way to cope with your life, and the shit that's happened, and the shit you know is going to keep occuring? I want a scale of 1 to 10, with ten being well-adjusted and 1 a babbling nutto. I think I'd read like the lottery, or bingo, numbers shooting out at random, striking people in the face. I would like things to be the way they are, simply. 

I'd like to know that when I sign on for something serious, it's going to be serious. And something that's not, isn't. 

One week ago I had a life of my own, down time and home-cooked meals and 8 hours of sleep per night. Now my days stretch into 20 hour long awkward explorations, confessions, and mutual silences accompanied by the occasional electrifying touch. It's weird that as a person with very little to offer, I continually feel like everyone wants something from me. Push your boundaries, break your limits. And in the morning, shamefully, I can't even look you in the eye."

"event","Alright, I'm back from Vancouver with only slightly more liver damage than I used to have, some artistic influence, ideas for projects about social change, and insider info about poverty, homelessness and drug use. Honestly, this weekend(ish) thing completely blew my mind. I met a German artist who, among countless other projects, made the Statue of Liberty glow red for hours almost a decade ago. I met professors and filmmakers, I collaborated on an installation about gang violence and the grieving process. I drug my classmates off of toilets where they passed out, carried them up stairs, I loaned money and had money loaned and became the guardian as the big tough boys shriveled in fear of passing junkies. Here are a few anecdotes you might want to know about my experience:

1.) Absinthe is legal in Canada. Unfortunetely, it's also expensive.
2.) There's a little shop called the New Amsterdam that's about 20 minutes from the hostel I stayed in. The locals told us that, should we ever need anything, to go up the stairs in the back alley, go through the door, and be greeted by the cheery gang of, um, Underworld Faeries who run the place and who can provide you with anything you need. I didn't go up there or even partake, but spend half an hour sitting there sipping a tea and man.........
3.) Homeless people will offer to climb trees for money - please don't let them.
4.) Boys who hit on old men will be kicked out of the bar. Also, boys who don't shower will get into fights with other hostel guests because they don't shower.
5.) vancouver lesbians are all 50, all wear leather, and scare the shit out of me.
6.) Okay. this is the real kicker. For most of the performances and openings, we had to pass through the area of Vancouver referred to as Skid Row. As in, THE skid row that is the stereotype for all the shitty movies, musicals, and stories that reference it. We're talking the third poorest neighborhood in North America, the other two being in New York and LA. The street is thick with people and everywhere you look, people are fucked up. I'm offered so much shit my head is spinning, I'm stepping over a guy passed out and twitching on the sidewalk, girls are walking the curb, we (me and 4 others that I travelled with) are literally the only people who don't live there. Cops everywhere, sitting around, eyeing people, and you are approached EN MASSE by people spangeing.  I watched a girl fighting with her pimp and people huddled together smoking crack and meth and I know how it smells now, which I never needed to. I watch people gathered outside the clinic where you get the cure, and this stretch of town is practically a mile long, and this is the safest street to get through it because it's the only one that's lit. Only after going through this area are we told about the random stabbings. And the weird part is, I was the one holding it together, me and my friend Christophe, who's been a junky, we're the ones keeping everyone calm but at the same time, I really expected to get my ass stabbed when I was there. I just feel like I've been dissallusioned from all of this, heard songs about it, but seeing it..... god, seeing it. 

It's a fucking trip. It's a bloody fucking nightmare, and I'm not apologizing for getting piss drunk afterwards in an attempt to burn the horror out of my head."

The wind of your kissing has bitten me.

Check your mail. Arrive home. Nap. Eat. Read, email, write. Twiddle your thumbs. Go to bed too early, repeat.

Is this what life is supposed to be? I don't want to be a grown up. Lately I have been faced with my own mortality... a mortality that may include loosing my teeth, but suddenly, I have to look at the Big Picture. How do I create a major? How do I get the job I need? Will this person be a good reference? Would this person be a good roomate? How much is a mortgage, anyway? Will I ever pay off my student debts? Is it really so great to be a student?

Why does everyone seem so incredibly false?

Even when I'm making friends, and getting a job I really enjoy, and trying new things that I never thought I would, it feels really... shallow. Like I'm faking at life. And as much as I try, I can't really care about anything very passionately just now. 

What if everything changes, or goes away, or wasn't what you thought? What if the crazy life you thought you'd lead isn't the life you're leading at all. 

I realize that great people, people worth remembering, have gigantic balls swinging down between their knees. And I mean that in a courage way, not just a man way. They're proactive and they push at everything. They move faster than life and we remember them as a blur. Me? I get passed on the sidewalk. I'm a turtle. 
and, I miss you in a way that makes me surprised when the sun comes up in the morning.

a slightly rounded face that, though loved,

After being pestered by friends and fam for a month I finally bit the bullet and went to the dentist to figure out why I look like a vampire (bloody teeth) all the time. The answer? On a health scale, 1-5 with 5 being worst, my gums scored a whopping 6. I have periodontis disease in the back of my mouth, severe gingivitis in the rest, and severly infected wisdom teeth that will spread to the rest of my mouth if I don't get them removed. Oh, and I also have two cavities and dangling sealant, and the cheery news that if this isn't all resolved in 6 months I'm looking at bone loss and a permanent, irriversable disease in my entire mouth, and not just around the back.

Children! Visit your dentist! Let this be a lesson to you all! Floss regularly!!! Brush after every meal!!! I'm going to owe almost a fucking grand just to get my teeth fixed, and then god knows how much to get my dying teeth extracted because they've already come in, and require a specialist. 

So, my friends, if you don't want to see me in dentures, please yell at me regularly to take my pretty fluoride and scrape my tender gums and smile nicely as my teeth are drilled, saying ""thank you sir, may I have another?""

"event","Today the psyche woke and stretched her fingers, numb under my cheek. We rolled around and entombed ourselves in the fading warmth of night; in the mirror, she pulls the feathers out of my hair and eyelashes. When I lifted our body and rubbed my pulsing eyelids she turned our pupils to the flattened pillow, flattened with the imprint of a face, of faint mascara, gooey hair gel and the smell of sweat from the brow. Can't you see that it is dirty? She asks. Every inch holds a hair or a crumb of a speck of skin and I want to swallow it all, holding the molecules in my throat. Our bedroom smells like dogshit and vaginal discharge, sweet enough to pucker my stubborn lips. 
  Do you remember how we dreamt? She asks when I stand. Our feet mold to the shapes of books and figures, clothing on the floor. I am wading through a puddle of emotion - she's on the bank reaching out her hand. My phyche is sweet, with trembling fingers, but she gives bad haircuts and now I look disfigured. She says that in the night we looked at pictures of ourselves, we held onto our class in their graduation robes, only they were dressed as angels. I think that they'd assended into heaven. I held a boy named Nick in my arms, and he held onto me tightly, whispering in my ear, ""Do you know that we both look sad? We are two sad people in love with each other. They don't understand but I know, you aren't really sad inside."" I wanted to melt into his bones. 
     She puts my hands in our hair and we pull. I wonder if we could drown ourselves by pressing our chin to my chest. She remembers how before the sun came up, sweet Karen asked me if my heart hurt. In the night, she held my hands and steered us home, playing all of our parents while I drifted up against the uncomfortable car interior. I wonder if sweet Karen could see inside my body and recognize this strange girl who held my voice down to a reasonable level. When a familar song is played, and I try to scream in joy and revolution, out of key and raw, all that escapes is a low harmonic moan. They both pretend not to notice.
     My psyche still has pigtails, wearing a fluffy white dress with blue embroidery that used to be my favorite. On the ride home she noticed every church and if the world were not so ignorant, I would have gone. How strange is that? When I let her talk she speaks with so much faith, and maybe I should be more believing too. 
    When we stand I pick a dampened towel, undressing without ceremony. In the mirror our body is crossed with the lines of sheets and cotton imprints, old bruises, new bruises, no spider bites. I miss the spider bites. I wonder if you have any new ones, how it will feel to unsubscribe to the daily edition of your body. My psyche is patient and runs the water until it's scalding hot, and we hold our face under the current until my eyes are red. The blur of skin that serves as our reflection in the foggy mirror settles well on me; we are not well defined, or sharp, and I feel more like a cloud than a girl. I wonder how it would feel to dress a cloud, if they dissapear in the same way that we do beneath the cotton and the demin and the glass. Maybe we'll condense on hard surfaces and I'll find myself again, soggy and complete.

did that make any sense?"

"event","I feel like the list of things to do is never-ending, and it doesn't matter if I procrastinate or get things done right away... because as soon as i finish one thing, it's onto the next. and even while i'm procrastinating, i'm stressed because i know eventually i have to do things. gahhhh between school and college and scholarships and online classes and friends and everything else in my life i'm just so done. im so ready for summer, i can't even explain. but even then, i feel like i'm going to be juggling 8927349837 things at once. work, lake shore park, gilford, college, etc. etc. etc. and i'm on vacation, so you would think it'd be a good break? but no. no no no. today and yesterday were spent doing a fourth of the homework my insane teacher assigned us for over vacation. why did i take calculus? no one can really say. i hate television. even if theres nothing on tv... i end up watching some stupid show that means nothing to me, instead of doing things that i need to do. then 2 hours go by and i'm like, damnit! you know what else i hate? boredom. because i somehow manage to find time to be bored (thats where procrastinating comes in) and when i'm bored i eat.. a LOT, lol. so far this vacation i feel like not ten minutes have gone by where i haven't been munching on something. 

want to know what i watched on tv today? probably not, but i'll write it down anyway... repeating sessions of backtoback full house, a repeat of the oscars on E, backtoback sabrina the teenage witch, grounded for life, you've got mail, and now i'm watching some lifetime movie that actually is really good. but honestly, i have so much to do... why am i addicted to such pointless things?

i miss my friends. everyones so busy and so into what they're doing lately that we haven't had time to hang out as a group much. i see everyone individually but i just want to have a day/night to be with everyone. 

this year has gone by so fast, maybe thats why i feel so behind on everything. i keep thinking i have a lot of time to do things, but time is rapidly sweeping away. seriously, it's about to be MARCH, the month where i turn 18! just yesterday it was christmas. and about a week ago it was summer. so basically in like a day, i'll be graduating from high school... what!? this year is SO fast, yet so much has happened. i mean, every year is always fast.. but this one especially so. does anyone agree? maybe i'm just insane. 

i guess i'm done. i just felt like typing :-]
i dont think anyone really reads this anymore anywayssss

bye!"

"event","so you know when you forget how much you love people? like, you don't really forget you kind of just don't think about it for a while... then you see a picture or read an old note/message and you're like ""wow i really love them. i miss them. that person is amazing"". yeah that happened to me tonight.. when i was looking at people's old livejournal entries/comments. and i rememebered how much i miss reading the thoughts of shaylan skye :-( and i wanttt to dedicate this to her (even though she probably won't read it) because i miss her so much, and she is SUCH an amazing, genuine friend. And two summers with her basically changed my life... not entirely because i'm still as lame as i always was... BUT in ways that only she would understand :) and i just love her, and feel the need to tell the world<3. PLUS, i think my most romantic moments have been with that girl.. i mean, have you ever broken in to a pirate's cove golfcourse in winter under a BRILLIANT starry sky and full moon? I have :-)

anyways, now that i've unraveled how much I love my bumblebee.. I guess I should get ready for bed. I have a really big math test tomorrow that i didn't really study for. but i'm soooo fed up with that class, and i'm at the point where i don't understand ANYTHING. and i COULD have gone to bed early tonight for the first time all week, but of course i thought it'd be a good idea to go on here and be on the internet for an hour? im really cool.

but anyways, although i could write in here forever i'm quite positive the world doesn't want to hear it, SO goodbye & goodnight<3"

Last night Matt, Pat, Paige, AJ, Lauren, Dave, Shay, Kris, and Sara came over for ""movie night""! ..hope i didnt forget anybody. It was really fun..we watched Jackass, which was hilarious (ive never seen it before). then the boys wrestled..then we all ran around outside but didnt get any ticks! :P me, shay, and paige figured out how to roll down the hill connected to eachother..it was SO COOL! andddd after like, hours of being crazy we went back inside and pretty much crashed. Kris left at 9:30, Matt left at 12, and everyone else left around 1. except sara stayed til 2 and talked with me, paige, and lauren :). Laur and Paige stayed over for the first P night in FOREVER, and it was so awesome. We talked for hours... and everything felt so right again, it was really nice. Then we went to pull out the bed for the pull-out sofa, but we couldnt because DAVE BROKE IT!!!!!! so its 5 in the morning, and we decide to make a bed out of couch cusions and build a sheet fort :D it was SO FUNNNN! i love forts! Eventually we fell asleep, i'm so glad we hung out last night.. it was much needed and i love them so much. laur left at 9 this morning for voice lessons, and paige and i woke up at 12..then her mom came. so last night was really fun :) I'm sorry if you're mad at me cuz you ""werent invited"" honestly, it started out with 4 people then it just kindof expanded...because things have a way of doing that. Anyone was welcome to come, i wasnt trying to leave anyone out. Sorry :/. 

annnnyyyyway, the Germans come back today! woohooo! I'm so busy this month... it's so crazy. And Prom's in 3 weeks?!?! IM not ready :P whatever... we'll get there. 

ive been working on my drivers ed project all day, and its really getting boring. I'm so bored, i really wanna do something tonight, like see a movie or something.

Mothers day tomorrow, i have no gifts ... hopefully i can come up with something tonight. 

LOVE AND LOVE AND HAPPY AFTERNOONS :-*"

I started Driver's Ed today, i feel like it's going to be sooooo much work before i get my liscence. blahh. After dr. ed, sara picked me up and we went tanning... then me and mom went for a drive. i was really disappointed cuz i wanted to work at guiseppie's but you have to be 18 to waitress, i could be a bus*girl* if i wanted. i have no idea where to work this summer. ideas anyone? Anyway i gotta go finish hw and hopefully eat soon... Night!

Today I was looking at pictures, and they made me so sad. I don't understand why I still feel this way and why lately its stressing me so much. but its all i can think about. :-(

enough with that, heres my day:
-French we played a review game and i guess i was having a dumb morning because everything i said/did was retarded. lol
-English me aaron and dj were distracted the entire time. drawing pictures and stuff...lol
-Math sucked. I hate that class.
-GYm we walked a mile and a half. and we walked up in the H's and we went by jasmines house. It made me soooo incredibly sad, I miss her so much :/
-Euro sucked. I cna't focus inthat class.
-Lunch was pretty good. I ate something healthy today! woo
-Bio we watched a movie...for TWO periods cuz it was lab day. omg i was so sleepy.
-Chorus was boring.
-After school we had a meeting for festival then rehersal. me and paige are co-hosting and co-foruming! WOO im kindof excited!!

-French- we were so easily distracted and not focused today. it was awful, lol. james drew on my back with a pen, and so i threw his water bottle, which got a hole in it. so then we tried to cover up the hole with tape, whcih just made a mess. then james threw watery towels in sara's backpack and she was pissed...they almost got detention. ohhh man, the things we do early in the morning :-P
-English-I could barely stay awake in english because we just talked about the book, and i was so incredibly tired. 
-Math- Mr. Wool wasn't in school today!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so i went to the caf for a few minutes to talk to paige pat and aj, and i borrowed aj's mathbook. went back to class, did the bookwork, went back to the caf to give aj his book back and talk some more. :-)
-Gym- we did workout videos again. we did this ""step"" thing and i like couldtn do it because i was so exhausted. also because i'm pathetic. then when we did the ab workout thing, i almost fell asleep listening to the lady's voice.
-Euro- omg boring.
-Lunch- connor was in our lunch today! :-D it was fun..
-Bio- omg boring.

EFFINNNNNNNNN A! ughhhhhhhhh i hate it when it does this, and now i have to retype the whole thing over again and im SO PISSED. GAH, anyway...
i had a really awesome weekend. yesterday (saturday) was rennie's birthday, and we all went to the soda shoppe at 1:45 to celebrate! and becca made really nasty brownies, haha but its the thought that counts :). After lunch, me, shay, connor, and lizi went to strawberrie's (i got the who) and walmart for cast gifts for dave. Then i came home, played guitar and stuff for a while, and went to the school at 7 for closing night!! closing night went really well, my uncle and grandparents came. patrick was hilarious, and i came very close to laughing several times. ohhh man.. it was fun. And then we only had to strike/clean up til like 10!! it was SO awesome! and then we had the first cast party in the caf, and it was pretty fun. we got chinese food and cakessss and senior toasts :(. anyway, we left the school earlier than we've ever left! usually we dont leave til like 1, but we got out i think around 11 or so. im not sure but it was pretty early. Then everyone went to connor's house for the cast party. it was so much fun, a lot of people had to leave at 1 but then the rest of us stayed over. it was tons and tons of fun, some interesting stuff happened, but it was fun. we lost an hour of sleep though because of daylight savings time, which sucked. I got absolutely no sleep last night, and i'm so exhausted. This morning me, kristyn, pat, paige, and matt left around 11:30 i think? i dont really remember.. but we left and we had to bring kristyn to her house then to laconia. so we brought her to her house,and as we're leaving we got stuck in her driveway... mud and all. It was bad, and the tension was already high enough since none of us got any sleep last night. so we called Tripple A and it took them an hour to get there. but we were okay.. we hung out and matt and i walked down to the store to get food. then when they finally came and unstuck us, we brought kristyn to laconia, went to dairy queen, went to pat's to get movies, and went to paige's to watch lord of the rings. that movie is like 800 hours long, but it's okay becuase we all like, passed out as soon as we layed down anyway. We left around 5:50 and im soooo exhausted. I feel like i got a total of 2 hours sleep, if that. and i have so much homework and stuff to do. blah. but it was a really fun weekend, and i have tons of pictures but i lost my camera at connor's. if anyone took it accidentally, lemme know cuz im like having a breakdown. 
this was the senior's last cast party :(

I'm practicing humility
And I lay myself before
'Cause less is more

and i think right now i feel okay for the first time in a while. :)"

"event","<P>so last night i was sick, and i missed out on the all girls night with paige, laur, and maggs... i was so disappointed! but we're gonna do it again sometime and hopefully i wont be sick then, lol. So last night me and mom rented movies and it was nice. i fell asleep at like 9:30 on the couch in my clothes... which is really weird for me. But i was really sick. By the way... Vanity Fair and Before Sunset are two really good movies. Then today we had rehersal at 1 and potluck dinner at 4:30... then i came home and wrote my English Essay in under an hour!!!!! SO impressed. </P>
<P>Then I hung out with Shay!!!!!! :-D I love her SO much! She came over and i showed her my prom dress :), then we started driving around spontaneously choosing which way to go. Eventually we decided to go to Border's and Taco Bell in Concord. So the best part of the night had to be just talking to shay in the car and just hanging otu with her. it was so much fun and we had a lot of catching up to do since we havent hung out in like 8 years. So we got to Borders and looked at CD's and other cool stuff... and we bought root beers, which ended up to be a disaster...but i'll get to that. so anyway, shaylan bought me an ISPY birthday present and im wicked excited, even though I can't have it til wednesday :P. Then we left Borders, and I managed to spill root beer alllll over the car. I know, you can't take me anywhere. and it got all over my stuff too, lol.&nbsp;But hey- it's okay! Then we went to taco bell cuz ive never been before!! and Shay took me for the FIRST time :D. it was soooooo good, and the guy there was totally hitting on us ;). and we got tons of napkins which we then used to clean up the mess. OH AND i got a free meal!!!! cuz the guy screwed up the order, yessss! it rocked! oh yeah and shay was telling me how the taco bell in concord was combined with a fish place, and so i thought there were gonna be like fish tanks and stuff inside... yeah it was a fish restaurant. my bad. i was very disapponted ;). And thennnnn we listened to really funny music and i liked it hahhaa, and we talked some more. then we went to the office because the entire WORLD was there! That was pretty fun, we havent gone there since the beginning of this year. Then people started getting in oxygen fights... you know those cans with the pressurized oxygen. it burns so bad! and we're all going to die tomororw because the warning said excessive inhalation can be fatal. I'm pretty sure we used up at least 3 cans. oh the things that amuse us. I got home at like 11 and i'm going to bed soon because tomorrow im going to boston with my uncle to see champions on ice!!! for my birthday. i'm so excited :) AND it's easter! happy early easter! actually.. its almost twelve now so i might as well say happy easter. ANyway tonight was really really fun and i love shaylan so much &lt;33333333333 </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

ps. we didnt inhale the cans (just so you know) we were simply spraying them...lol.
<P>Goodnight!</P>
<P>ps. sorry for the over-detailed entry. :)</P>"

"event","so i realized that all of my entries lately have been rather depressing, sorry. I can't help it... that seems to be the new thing these days. Anyway, this week wasn't very good... at all. But it had it's highlights.
-Sunday my family won a wicked nice plug in tailor guitar from guiseppie's!!! it was so sweet
-Monday was terrible. Then Patrick and Matt took me and Paige out to burger King, and we got crowns and cool toys. We were going to go to water arobics, but we werent really in the mood. so we went to pat's house with aj and watched ladder 49. the boys thought it was the saddest movie ever, but me and paige didnt really think so... and we were kinda disappointed cuz we were looking forward to a good movie cry.
-tuesday was terrible too. I don't remember much about it. i think that was the day patrick took me home and i couldn't find my key. so then i had to go back to the school, but i saw kris callahan for like a minute. then i got my whole outline done. then that night me and brian talked for like an hour and a half. it was good to talk to him, i miss him and everyone from summer.
-Wednesday sucked aswell. really sucked. Then after school we had a lovely's meeting but it was short. i dont remember anything about the rest of my night. OH YEAH! me patrick and aj went to paige's to see her lovely prom dress selection, and the one she picked is very beautifullll. then we met dave laur m and maggie at the gstock inn for WATER AROBICS!!! hahahahaha it had to be the highlight of my week. then i came home, decided not to do my hw, and watched a cute movie with mom but she fell asleep. 
-thursday also sucked. but in gym we did a workout video, and then i came home and ran a mile and a quarter. i also called lauren, and i'm glad i did.
-friday (today) was okay. i'm sick though :( and im really worried that i wont be better before the shows next week. that would suckkkk. today in gym we did TAE BOE. it was pretty cool.... im into the whole excercise thing lately, lol but im so sore. 

So I'm kind of annoyed for various reasons... but whatever I'll get over it. 

I'm hanging out with shaylan tomorrow night!!!! :-D

im so busy this weekend... we have rehersal tomorrow at 1, and sunday is easter and im going to boston with my uncle for the day for my birthday :) an di have to write an essay for english. blahh im wicked stressed. And we have 3 shows next week.  WOO 

but im gonna go. hope you appreciate the long awaited update<3"

THat was at your house. -I miss walking to the golf course, scared that we'd get eaten by a bear. -I miss not being able to do anything if it wasn't together. -I miss liking the same boys, even though all of us knew none of us could get them. -I miss sitting in our stairwell talking about how it was our home. -I miss emailing eachother about EVERYTHING, even stuff none of us cared about. -I miss church on sundays and youth group on tuesdays. -I miss being online and telling everyone that we were lesbians, even though we weren't. -I miss going to bed in the middle of a conversation- and picking up where we left off in the morning. -I miss running in the woods and getting COVERED in mosquito bites. -I miss eating tons and tons of popsicles- because they had no calories. -I miss walking 082347 miles to your house at night, talking about how we were probably going to get raped- then sitting on a rock and talking about how we didn't need boys because we had eachother. -I miss talking about prom, and planning out EVERYTHING. -I miss knowing exactly what you're thinking. -I miss the way we used to be. -I miss talking about EVERYONE, then saying how upset we were that someone was talking about us. -I miss the stupid things. -I miss the feeling we used to get when we were all together. -I miss being ""a unit"" -I miss going to the bathroom together. -I miss sharing our faith. -I miss how we were the most important thing, and we didn't have to say it because we knew. -I miss the first time you admitted that it was real. -I miss 3way phone calls and chatrooms. -I miss the smiles i see in all the pictures. -I miss ""speaking in tongues"". -I miss being sure that we'd work it out. -I miss the list of 10 things that could possibly be wrong wtih your guy. -I miss the triangle. -I miss everything. -I miss us. -I miss last year. this is probably the most pathetic entry i have ever written.

Anyway, today was regionals!! we went to hillsborough... we were all soooo nervous. there were 6 shows, and only 3 would make it on to states. but we did it, and it went really well... and there were afew other good shows too. 
HIGHLIGHTS of festival:
-connor boosting myself esteem 9823749689724 points
-drinking an almost full bottle of apple cider
-waiting for 8 hours on my line so the audience could clap at the fact that patrick called me a whore
-""HEYYYYYYYY"" yeah gilford
-basketball: girls v. boys (played with a soccer ball)
-acting like idiots at the dance and dancing on the balcany with shay
-stalking two really cute boys with gracie and paige, here's the story:
so we follow these two cute guys to see where they're going (being all stealth/james bonde like), and we pass dave setchell.
Paige: ""we're following those cute boys!""
Dave: ""DID YOU JUST SAY THOSE BOYS WERE CUTE?!??!!?""
boys turn around, girls run away screaming
...haha yep, it was nice. 
-a really cute boy talked to me!! lol, it was cute. 
-playing mad soccer in the gym
-moving on to STATES!

today was wicked fun... and im so happy we made it to states. it's not until april. the show's in like, 1 or 2 weeks.. like how i dont even know? everyone should come see it! It's ""welcome to lovely's"" and Eustace. today was so fun, and i love everybody soo much! lol, love how i say that everytime i hang out with them :)

"event","today absolutely sucked. I wore green, but I don't think I'm Irish. maybe I am. I don't remember. I was in an awful mood today, we weren't doing anything in math so i went up to the art room to try and finish my clay thing thats still not done. then i left in the middle of gym to finish styding for my euro test. I was so out of it all day, and the day went FOREVER, not to mention i had 981236590834 things on my mind. then afterschool things started to get better. patrick dropped me and paige off here, and we hung out for like 15 minutes, then he picked us up at 3 and he brought us mcdonalds parfaes!!! they were yummy. then we had rehersal=fun. and faith was there, but she was NICE! and i had a good time in rehersal, if it wasn't for the show and the people in it... i think i would have shot myself right now. 

so AJ, thanks for writing this show :) 

but yeah... so my day went from horrible-ehhh-good-great. and even though we were at the school until 9, it didn't really feel that long. so hey yay for a semi-good day. But now I'm going to bed. GOODNIGHT<3"

I didn't eat lunch because i thought we would go out for lunch after school. Little did I know, we had rehersal RIGHT after school! and rehersal wasnt very fun...it was okay. ughhh but i'm so frusterated with everything. and then the people i need to talk to the most arent there. And theres so many things I need to say, but I can't. See my problem is, I care about consequences, so I can't tell you what I need to say to you because I know what will happen. But I don't know how long I can just keep pretending it's no big deal. The show's on saturday and i have two tests tomororw in bio and in euro, i'm so stressed. 

ughhhh i know that made no sense, but everything is changing.. and so many things are going on, i just don't know how to handle everything. And I don't know what to do.

And mom said that ""There are so many bad things going on around us, we just have to cherish the good moments"". and i really liked that.

It's so easy to just have fun and not get into all the annoying crap so I don't understand why everyone has to make it so friggen hard. IM SO ANNOYED. and i'm really annoyed with the mood swings... is there something you want to say to me? cuz if there is, i'd really appreciate it if you would just say it, because i'm really confused and i don't understand.

So the three of us just hung out...all day. then later we played cards with penny, lol that was fun. Dave and Jamie came over around 8 or 9..i dont remember. and we went snowshoeing, it was sooo cool! we went up to round pond..and it was wicked awesome doing it at night, it was so nice. we built a fire and roasted marshmellows. actually, dave built the fire. Then we found igloos and went inside, only i only went half way in cuz i was afraid it was going to collapse :P. but when we played king of the igloo, it still didnt collapse! i was impressed. So we spent a lot of time up at round pond, and we didnt get back to the house until 12. It was an awesome night, i loved being with paige and the boys. it was just really relaxing and nice. I love my friends :)

"event","snow day today!!!! which is awesome cuz i wanted it sooo bad. i got my computer back!!! lol, i know a day doesnt seem very long, but trust me.. it was!so todya is going to be a day of doing nothing and enjoying my computer :) andddd i love just being home by myself. 

i havent done one of these in a while:

-I never understood the expression ""holy shit""
-Time amazes me- and i love and hate it at the same time.
-I have never met a nonhypocritical person.
-What purpose do alligators serve in the world? besides boots and purses..
-I think there is a type of music for every emotion.
-I hate the expression ""everything happens for a reason.""
-Eyes are wicked cool. I think they're the coolest part of a person. Think about everything that has been seen through someone's eyes. its so cool!
-I love pictures, and I love how they can capture a single moment or emotion.
-Pineapple icecream is soooooo good.
-I hate regret- if you did something, you must have had a reason to do it at that moment, and if you hadn't done it you probably would have regretted THAT. However, I always regret things... but i love this quote: ""Never regret what once made you smile"".
-I'm a wicked romantic- it's bad.
-I often look back and want what i HAD.
-I'm scared of the future, but sometimes excited.
-I've never been to Mexico, or anywhere out of the country.
-I saw my first alligator this year!
-I hate it when people are misleading.
-I don't like it when people are fake, but i probably do it too sometimes..
-Discuss your opinions with me, but don't force them on me.
-It really confuses me that there are so many religions in the world- and everyone believes their religion is true. so how do we really know which one is true? or do they all eventually come down to the same thing, only with different names? and why is EVERYONE so sure of their religion? why are there so many if only one is true? -and then i think about it too much and just forget about it.
-Time goes too quickly.
-Spring is my favorite season.
-Alligators are a lot like dinosaurs. it's kinda creepy.
-Life is really complicated, especially lately. Is it just me?
-I odn't want to get out of high school. It's comforting to know what you're doing each day... but I do want to move on with my life, it's just kinda scary.


okay, im done. Oh yeah and i liked this quote that my dad gave me too:

""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shind, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others."" -coach carter

ok, now im really done :) Bye!"

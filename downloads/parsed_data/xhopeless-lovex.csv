"event","Hm I havent updated in a little while. I guess there hasnt been too much to say because my life is pretty boring. I went out to the Hamptons with my mom and sister on Saturday. We had to stay with my grandma while my grandpa went bak into brooklyn for a few days because my grandma needs help getting around the house. So I was mucho boredo especially since Joe (my cousin) was super annoying. But he went home on Monday and I invited Colleen out. There was some drama Monday and Tuesday which I wont put up because it would take a long time. To sum it up, a guy got me really pissed and now I refuse to talk to him because he is a jerk. Humph..anyway, now I'm home. Today me and Shanell were supposed to go to Serenas house to study for the math test tomorrow, but Serena had to cancel last minute :(  So now I'm stuck studying alone and doing last minute shopping for my trip. 
 Speaking of trip..AHHH!! I CANT WAIT!!! I found out yesterday that elena is still gonna be in Dallas Saturday so she's gonna hang out with me and Sam. Then Sunday  night I fly to Austin!!! Rachel is worried that I'm not gonna have a good time, psh rach if you are reading this, dont worry!!! I'm so happy to just be leaving this house and this family that I would love just hanging out. But dont worry we are gonna have a lot of fun. 
 AH! sorry theres like, large amounts of thunder outside and my dog just like freaked out. he ran into the kitchen and practically gave himself a concussion on the refrigerator. tehe..Ok tomorrow I got the math test in the morning, then I'm goin out to lunch with Shanell, and then I'm hanging out with Kenzi and Nicole. We are having a Guys Hunt because most guys we know suck. :)Then on Friday I'm doin all this last minute stuff. Packing, gettin my nails done, doind my hair, etc. 

Okay i gotta go shower and stuff. Might not write for awhile now. I'm kinda gettin bored of LJ. adios"

I cant remember that much so yesterday I went to Kenzis house with nicole and we layed in the pool and tanned with the yummy tanning oil (kenzis kinky playtoy). oh we also had made bubble blowing skills :) then i left early to shower, and drive to natalees house. she had a few ppl over for a bbq and me and christina slept over. i loooovee her house sooo freakin much!!! and her sisters are the best!! anyway we watched laws of attraction and when harry met sally. this morning we ate breakfast out on the patio (overlookin the water mind you). then we went kayaking, swimming in the bay, dug up clams, swam in the public pool, and did yoga!! yeah it was crazy cool. so then i went straight from there to graces house!! i took a super fast shower there and her mom drove us to brians. me, grace, brian and some guy named nick went out on brians boat which was fun bc we all jumped into the water and laughed and stuff. then the guys got ""frisky"" and were throwing me and grace overboard which we kinda didnt like b/c the water was deep and dark :( 

yeah so now im very very tired and i need another shower!! i feel like i got all this sand and seaweed on me and i smell like who knows what. :x buuut i still wanna go to the beach tomorrow :) anyone wanna come?? oh and whats everyone doing for 4th of july?? bc id really like to partay with friends if i can get outta goin to my grandparents house. sorry this was so short, ill update more later.

"event","Hey!! Wow super amazing time last night!! Before anyone starts reading, if you dont wanna hear about my night (for some strange reason) you should stop now because this entry is mainly about that. 
 Anyway so Lisas mom picked me up at four something and we got there a little after 5. the only other person there was matt (go figure--dont wanna know what they were up to cough cough ;) So we sat out on trish's deck with music, food all that stuff. more ppl came and we kinda just mingled and ate for awhile. ppl spread out along the sand, deck, inside *wink* I mostly stayed with Trish, Matt, Liz, Aaron, Eric, Danny, Emily, Tyler, and Sam. Sometimes ppl walked away, sometimes I went away, but ya get the pic. Okay so we eat dinner, dance, and then some of us go out onto trish's ""baby"" aka her boat. It was super fun and Liz was like, OMG IM FALLING!! haha yeah a liilll paranoid. Then we saw ppl jumping into the water so we were like, o what the hell. so we all went in and were like, LIZ JUMP!! and shes like, ARE THERE ANIMALS IN THERE?!?! SHARKS?! Okay so all in all it was a very fun night and I dont wanna go into too many details because that would be boring and long. Toward the end ppl had left so me Trish and Emily layed on the sand and just talked. Talked about the most random things but I think it was one of the best parts of the night. Dont wanna get all sappy on ya so I'll stop there. I can also get sappy in another topic *wink* but I'll refrain on account of Aaron saying I'm gonna make him sick. All I'll say is that i know You are reading this and i had a great time just being ourselves. You're so awesome and i dont know how i got so lucky. 
 Okay so I got home around 1;30, went to bed, and got up at 7. Went to school, took the ES regent (not too bad, i didnt fail) and then i went lookin for grace. Took me awhile but we got to her moms car, picked up her bro and his gf, and chilled at her house for about an hour. there was a bit of drama with some guy named joe--but w/e its okay now. so then we picked up her friend brian, who had gone to St Ants, but left before i got there. he was sooo nice tho!! we went to this pizza place in the mall (why are all these ppl staring at us?) then we walked to this cosmetics store and tried on all these gross perfumes :x then we went to the candy shoppe (Ill take ya to the candy shop..) and grace and i got GUM!! oo the sugar....then we got bored so we went to blockbuster and rented boogeyman and the shining..whoa i was so freaked! we watched them in a dark room and then it started thundering!! then we played mario car racing thing and grace kicked ass!!! but then brian was sweet and distracted her so i could win :) thnx brian!!! 
 so now im home *sigh* and i got no more tests or anything *double sigh* i am happy, dont get me wrong, it just feels like this year went soo fast so im worried about the next three years. ANNNYWHOOO its summer so im very excited to party it up and be with friends outside of school. not to mention my tx trip!! ive missed sam and rachel so much so im totally ready to get OUUTA HERE!!!

 ok well im gonna go do some exercise (i feel sooo fat right now!!) and then heat up some leftover macaroni :/

"event","I know I just updated yesterday but today was my last day of school and im more upset than i thought i'd be. Plus I've been studying like crazy today so I needed a break. 

Math-Went thru the homework quick and then just hung out in class. serena and i took pix and talked with joe (who isnt coming back next year. actually A LOT of ppl arent coming back, luckily not too many ppl im friends with).
Spanish-finished our listening comp. test and then played bingo. i love ryan and kate so much!!
Science-reviewed a bit and then watched this slideshow mr medina made from pix he took all year. it was kinda sad but there were so many funny pictures it was hard not to laugh. Plus its earth science so yeah, cant be too sad to begin with. I'm gonna miss shanelle and ashytn soo much!!!!!
Free-last d free! :(  sat with the usual ppl and just took pix and talked. 
Free-Sat with serena, sam and ashytn. went to look for sexy engel but we couldnt find him! and stupid mrs mastro was like, uh was it MY turn to watch him? ...psh idiot.
Global-did some partner work with colleen and mrs gash made this cute speech. aww im gonna miss her!
English-reviewed and ms creighton got kinda annoyed at all of us freakin so much and being ""honorish"" but then at the end she talked about how great the year was and how she might have us again 10-12. and we ar ein her c-dawg club!! yay!!! we all feel very special because she taught us the handshake and she said if anyone ever became validictorian (spelling??) that we had to do the handshake before our speech. lmao our class is awesome. 
theo-just hung out in class. drew on the board, took pictures etc. 
ok then the last bell rang and everyone in the school freaked! haha yeah it was really great.

the main reason im writin this is because i wanted to say how much i love st anthonys and everyone there!! ive made so many great friends and everyone is like a big family. the teachers know who everyone goes out with, they give us their email addresses and say to write if they ever need anything, mrs gash even passed around her yearbook for us to sign. my friends are so great and i know we are gonna stay friends a long time. you guys have been there for me when i needed you. 
trish-you were one of my first friends here and one of my best. you understand me so well and know exactly what to say to make me laugh. i can always count on you to stand up for me and help me out and i love you so much
natalee-your the sweetest person ive ever met and you always have somethin nice to say when im down. we got some great laughs together and i can be on the phone with you for hours!
colleen-wow we have tons of insiders!! i dont know anyone i can laugh that hard with on a daily basis. not only do you make me laugh, you know when im down and when to be sensitive and not funny. your so great at listening and i love you so much.
serena-math class would not be the same without you. your a great kid even though you seem to have the lowest self esteem ever!! haha omg engel is gorgeous and i love how you can always say whats on your mind. we got so many laughs and i cant wait to hang out with you this summer. 
shanell-my favorite ES buddy ever. we can always freak out together and rank on mr medina. i love talking to you about our shows and we definitley gotta hang out this summer ! we are gonna see each other next year (psh duh!)
grace-i havent known you for long but everytime i see you i end up crying from laughter. you are so awesome and ppl might think we r crazy but who cares right?? lmao im gonna call you asap to hang out and sneeze and cough on people some more!!
ashtyn and emily-or is it emily and ashtyn...?? haha jk jk. you guys are so cool and i love having D with you guys. i really hope we see each other next year!
brad and ryan-wow...lots of insiders with you two! most of them were about the same thing cough cough. uh you guys kinda already planned on me seeing you so...yeah
danny-another one of my first friends here. i met you on the first day of school and i knew we were gonna be close. we have so much in common and we always make each other crack up. weve had some differences but i dont know what i would do without you. youve gotten me through the whole year and ive helped you through some of your own problems. if you ever need anything i hope you know ill be there and we are gonna stay friends no matter what.


sorry this has been so long. im really excited its summer and i know that im gonna have a great time with ever everyone!! i gotta get back to studying so bye!!

free-blahh this one wasnt as fun but it was my last e free with colleen charlie and danielle. they all have either gym or comp tomorrow and im with serena and sam :)

math-went over our test. i got a 97 so serena and i just passed notes. and joe was so freakin annoyin and he like, broke my camera so i hate him (if i can hate him anymore than i already do..)
spanish-listening/comprehension test blaah. last ten min of class i talked with cate and ryan <33 my fave spanish buddies ever! and drew was makin fun of cate bein a drummer so i stole his pen and threw it out the window :) too bad we were on the first floor...

ok well besides all that not too much is going on..im a little nervous about my english and global tests because we gotta write essays. and i gotta study a lot of english crap so i should go.  next time i write, it will be SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im kinda sad because i really love school now and everyone has become so close. i really hope i see everyone next year and even though my teachers hate sophomores ill come bother them :) later lovies!!

spanish-took a test and then talked about our pinata party on wed. 
science-omg i fuckin hate mr medina. he made us sit in alphabetical order with 7 days of school left!!! so now im in the Idiot Triangle (thats my name for sittin right near ian, danielle and pete) and shanelle, cassandre and ashtyn are in total different places! argh so we are reviewin for regent and i think im actually gonna pass!! :)
free-sat outside with colleen, brad, and natalee. uhhhh yeah thats it ;)
free/history-i had a free but no one else had it and i didnt wanna go to the library or sit in the caf by myself so i went to natalees history class with her and mrs fleming is so nice!! she was like, sure come on in! and i helped natalee review for final and i answered a quest. right that no one else knew so now mrs fleming thinks im cool ooo yeaaaa...
history-i love mrs gash! the guys were like, tryin to ask her a ? she wouldnt know the answer to and nick asked her some ? about mike tyson and we were all like o come on nick thats gay and mrs gash starts sayin all these facts about him and nick is like..uuhhh yeaah..anywho did some review crap

"event","Arghh I'm so mad right now. My whole weekend was awesome and then something (should say someone) got me totally p.oed. Now someone else got me kinda mad too b/c they are such a two face and put on an act when they're with me. All I'm gonna say is that unless we can somehow work this out (and it doesnt mean you grace me by talkin to me. i mean an apology for bein so rude) then i want nothing to do with you. im fed up by this immature crap of puttin away messages on thinkin this stops us from talking. 

*sigh* ok anyway i had a fun weekend otherwise. saturday i went to star wars with waring and we had so much fun because we sat all the way in the back. we cried, laughed, grabbed each others arms when we got freaked..yeah i heart her so. then we got some coldstone. she tried to throw money into my car (to pay me back for the ticket) but i ran to her mailbox and drove away before she could get it tehe. then nicole slept over that night and we fell asleep watchin snl. went to church this morning, then went to the mall. i got some sunglasses, a skirt, some tanks and a light jacket. still need flip flops! haha. so now im home waitin for finale of housewives to come on (20 min). 

 i dont wanna sound geekish but star wars was actually really good. the special effects were so cool and it even had romance! ...sorta. i wont say anythin in case anyone hasnt seen it. but now my neighbor lent me the other movies so i got to catch up a bit lol. hayden christiansen is sooo hot!

 last full week of school!!! that might sound like its not a lot but then i got a four day week and a three day week, then im done. not too bad :) 18 min till housewives so im gonna go get my pjs on and get some popcorn possibly. i hope gabrielle ends up with john!!! hed b a much better father than carlos

"event","Hiya loves hows it goin?? Yeah ok the rest of my school week was ok. I am now mad because rachel and sam are done with school (ok rach has tests but thats it) and i still have 12 days argh. BUUUTT i go to great adventure with colleen in 22 days woot! ok ok i gotta wake up at like 5 somethin but it'll b worth it ;)

Lets see yesterday i was supposed to have movie night with colleen natalee and charlie so they can catch me up on this big star wars thing but collee went and saw the new movie so that was a bust. then i was gonna go to serenas softball game and my mom was a loser and wouldnt drive me so that didnt work either. so i finally went out, rented star wars 4, 1, and 2 and watched two of them by myself. 

Today started out crappy because i was fighting with like 4 different ppl but now im ok with 2 of them. then there was a crisis yesterday after school but that sorta blew over..kinda. and now i was fightin with my mom because i wanna do crew next year but the school doesnt finance it which means parents gotta pay big bucks for canoes, buses, etc. and my mom flipped when i told her how much extra it would cost plus the recently raised tuition. :/ so i was mad bc she always wants me to do things but then when i pick somethin i rreeally want she says no and SHE said that i always gotta pick the expensive things just so she'll say no and i can b mad at her which is soo not true!! not in this case at least..well we still havent decided on that but she agreed to run to the movies to try and get tix for me and waring today which was nice. hopefully ill b goin to the movies around 3;20 or 4;40. if anyone else wants to come call my house!

tomorrow im goin to the mall with kenzi and nicole to get a jacket for all of us to share over summer and i am gonna spend my gift card money on summer stuff..cant wait till summer!! even tho i know im gonna b upset on the last day of school ;(

gotta go shower later!

A birthday on the 6th of the month adds a tone of responsibility, helpfulness, and understanding to your natural inclinations. 

Those born on the sixth are more apt to be open and honest with everyone, and more caring about family and friends, too. 

This is a number associated with responsibility and caring - this birthday lends a degree of concern for others.</td>

 G U Y S
1. Don't ever lie to us; we always find out. 
2. We don't enjoy talking dirty to you as much as you enjoy listening. 
3. Don't say you understand when you don't. 
4. Girls are pretty; get over it, especially yours. 
5. You don't have PMS; don't act like you know what it's like. 
6. Saying something sweet might get you off the hook; doing something sweet will always get you off the hook. 
7. If you talk about having a big dick; we know you don't. 
8. Size does matter, but only to hoes; not girls that want relationships. 
9. We don't like it when you act like Mr. Big. 
10. A system in your car only impresses your homeboys not us. 
11. No matter what you say, your ex-girlfriend is a hoe. 
12. It's good to be sensitive, sometimes. 
13. If you did something wrong or even if you didn't, apologize. 
14. Be spontaneous; dinner and a movie won't always cut it. 
15. We are self-conscious by nature; we can't help it. 
16. We are DrAmA queens. 
17. Fashion police do exist. 
18. Don't ask us to give head; if you are nice you just might get it. 
19. We absolutely DO NOT care about monster trucks, car systems, paintball, or anything else you and your friends talk about. 
20. Hugs and kisses must be given at all times. 
21.We don't shave our legs everyday :get over it. 
22. Don't make bets about us; we always find out. 
23. Shave; no matter how cool you think your go-T or beird or mustache looks, we hate it. 
24. Even if you think it is cool to burp, fart, or emitt other strange gases from your body, it is not.
25. Don't compare our breasts with Pamela Anderson's; hers are fake, just remember that. (remember: u have a shot at ours than you ever will with hers) 
26. It is not cool to shoot snot rockets. 
27. We are beautiful at all times. 
28. We will always think we are fat, so humor us and tell us we aren't. 
29. You can shoot hoops, score a goal, knock down big fat guys, and hit a little baseball with a stick, so why the hell can't you piss in the toilet and not on it.
30. Most importantly: we are always right; so don't forget it."

"event","Hey hows it goin? I havent updated in about a week but not too much has been goin on. I had school this week and it actually went pretty fast. I thought it wouldnt because my sister had off and it was the last week of april. Uh lets see..I stayed after everyday for badminton and we had some games. I love Kim and Michelle in case anyone was wondering lol. We didnt have band mon,tues,or wed which was nice but then he came in on thurs and friday because our concert is in may (i think) and we got the night rehearsals coming up soon. Friday in band though was funny because it was the play night so all the ppl who are in pit got off and bradley asked if he could have free too since he was part of the play but mr engel made him stay since he was acting not playin music. So bradley was so pissed and kept makin fun of him throughout all of practice. Which isnt too hard considering when he gets mad his head looks like a tomatoe and he has this bump on the side of his head that we think may be a tumor. Haha. Had three tests this week and i got a 100 on math and i think i did really good on history and science. 
 After school yesterday colleen and i stayed after and while we waited for my mom to pick us up we changed into regular clothes. Met up with serena and shanell and layed outside on the grass listenin to ringtones lol. Then colleen and i went to my house to hang out, have pizza and then we went back to school for the play (Little Shop of Horrors). Charlie and his little sister met us there and we saw mrs gash! anywhoo the play was soo awesome. everyone in pit and on stage was so good! and we sat like right in front and when they had the fog come out we got covered in it. (""bang the baldy"" <---dont ask) Colleen Nat and I are def. doin pit next year. So then Colleens madre drove me home and i went to bed. 
 Not sure what I'm doin today because serena has to call me back to say if her and deandra can go to a movie. if not im totally free all day (with limited cash sorry) so call for plans. 
 25 school days left woot!!! im excited but now its gettin to that bitter-sweet thing you know? Im gonna be sad when 9th grade is over because im not gonna have the same class with the same teacer again :( But summer is gonna be soooooooooo fun!!!!!!!!!!!!! Next week i got mon tues wed and then im off ascension thurs and EXTENSION friday (haha i thought that was funny). and whats friday?? MY BDAY!??! shut up...oh wait, yes it is!!! ha! yay go 15, go 15, go go go 15. ok im done now sorry. :)

"event","Heyy hmm i havent updated in awhile. Lets see, nothing too interesting has been going on. Schools been school and we are FINALLY almost done with april. It seems like this was a long month but i guess thats because we had three full weeks of school in a row (gasp). But the weather has been so nice and that always seems to make the week better. Ive been staying after a lot just to hang outside with everyone and there are always tons of people doing something. Kids play pickup bball,there are all the usual teams practicin, people just sit out in the courtyard and all that stuff. I think this week should go pretty quickly because I have a lot of projects and we are startin to prep for finals/regents.Plus badminton ends soon and we are tryin to plan a party. It seems like when I have a lot to do days go by quicker because i dont have time to just sit around. I dont know how fast may will go but i dont care too much because its the last full month of school and i want to try and enjoy it. 30 days of school left!! 

 Okay so Friday was Nicoles bday party. Kenzi and I slept over and we had a lot of fun. We watched Zoolander and Little Mermaid (dont even ask. They were in the mood to see it). Isnt it funny how you could not see a movie in like years, but still remember all the songs and stuff? Nicole also got us started on our obsession with plain white t's. They are extremely awesome and we are already hopin they have a concert here this summer. Kenzi thinks one song is sad but I think its more cute than sad. Kinda random..Yesterday I just stayed around the house and cleaned my mess of a room, helped my dad with some stuff in the basement, and then took a nap. My family went to church and then my parents took us to outback for dinner. My dad ordered this big rib/steakish thing which looked so gross and made me lose like half of my appetite. I had some salad, 4 glasses or rasberry iced tea, and a gigantic chocolate cake thing. Today my mom went into the city to see a play with my grandma for her 80th bday (my grandmas not my moms) which leaves my dad as primary caregiver (gulp). I know im gonna end up doin all the sister watching and cleaning etc. sigh i should really get paid for this. I could use the cash actually because Im savin up for my trip this summer (my parents have so rudely decided not to supply money for my trip sayin they have done enough when really all they did was call the airline and buy the ticket. oh how stressful..) plus i really want to get an ipod before i leave. i refuse to bring all the cds i want to listen to throughout the trip in a backpack or something. plus how many batteries would i need? i was hopin the subtle hints that i dropped to my mom would give her the thought to buy one for my bday but unless she has some kinda of sudden change of mind within the next 12 days i dont think it will happen. so anyone who wants to help, please send a check (anywhere from 5-100 dollars) to me :) jk. 

 Oh one quick thing left. This may sound totally evil but i consider it payback. This guy uh..Bob likes me. Me and two other girls (he is supposedly ""confused"" at the moment psh). This has been goin on for almost two months now and im gettin slightly p.oed because I feel like I'm somewhat not allowed to try and go out with other guys just because BOb cant make up his mind you know? PLus some other stuff involving a close friend uh Jane happened that makes Bob look like a loser. So Jane and I decided that if Bob happens to ask me out I will go out with him and then a few weeks later out of the blue dump him. This may sound cruel but Bob has been a very fickle boy and doesnt seem to notice how much he hurt Jane. 

 Okay this was longer than I expected and I have these three labs I have to do for Science by tomorrow. And I gotta make a soap doll replicant of myself for English (dont ask). Adios.

"event","Yay its such a nice weekend. :) i love spring. Yesterday I stayed after school (along with like half the school. seriously the school doesnt mind if you just hang after school so kids were just sittin in the halls, layin in the grass, some guys were playin bball and stuff like that). christina colleen and i were outside in the commons and then kevin austin and charlie came from track. colleen had to go home so we escorted her to her car. christina and i, the total losers of the group, gave each other piggy back rides and i stubbed my toe :( then serena came and sat with us and then i had to go home :( but kevin stole my phone and like ran around the school. it took us 757089265892 hours to find him and then i finally got home. i took a shower and then went to baja grill with nicole. we walked to starbucks and got these awesome seats (score!) got home and was sooo tired so i went right to sleep. 

 Today I slept till 11 and then had to help outside for almost 5 hours! yeah so then i layed in the grass and almost fell back to sleep until snickers attacked me....loser. i gotta shower again and then i might try and do somethin with kenzi because she isnt havin a very nice day :( tomorrow im goin to serenas softball tournament at shs fields and then we are gonna go out to lunch. 

 the plans to austin and dallas are finally gonna be final!!! we talked to samms mom yesterday and im gonna stop over in dallas for a day or two to visit there. then they r gonna drive me back to the airport and im flyin to austin for a week or somethin. im soo excited to see my friends and my dad finally agreed to let me go by myself.

 kinda bored at the moment but i think im gonna go to sleep. i still have this bad cold and i really wanna get rid of it because im runnin outta tissues :("

"event","Hey hows it goin? Yeah this weekend was pretty good. We had off on Friday because of the popes funeral. I mean, no offense to him or anything but i dont think we should have gotten off. First of all we just came back from easter break on monday, we had a mass for him wed, and (yeah this is gonna sound totally geekish) but i mean they are all crammin this big ass pile of work on us and pressurin us with finals and regents..if we had THAT much work why do we keep gettin off?? I mean i just realized today how close summer is and im gettin a lil freaked out (school wise) because i feel like im not ready for any of these tests. we have 15 school days of april left, 3 days off in may, and then only 8 days in june. on one side its like, woot! summertime, but it still freaks me out. This year like, flew by. I guess its because halfway through i changed school and then it took me awhile to get into full school mode again but still..

Anywhoo friday I just hung around the house and caught up on sleep all day. About 5;30 colleen and natalee came over and we had some pizza and went to see fever pitch with kenzi. Very cute movie i heart jimmy fallon. I think everyone got along okay--which is good to see your newer friends gettin along with ""the pubs"" as colleen calls them. then natalees mom called and said that she couldnt come pick natalee up because somethin came up with her sister and she couldnt leave the house so we invited them to sleepover. Oh my lord, that was fuckin awesome. we made these huge sundaes, took like 658972657 pictures that came out soo funny, listened to like every cd i own (karaoke!!) and stayed up till 5 am (i kid you not). yeah--considerin their moms came at 10;30 it kinda sucked. but anyways saturday i went to marias communion and saw ::gasp:: michelle!! my favoritest badminton buddy! her cousin was gettin communion too so we sat in the back together (away from the embarrassin family photos). then my family went to NJ to visit my grandparents. i mostly played outside with the little kids (i heart ian!!). oh and i watched some of the kim possible movie..yeah yall know you love that girl too. today i slept a lot because i dont feel too good :( i was supposed to go to colleens dance competition but i overslept and felt like crap :( sry babe. got all my homework done already though so now i think im gonna go outside again and chill. 

HOUSEWIVES IS ON TONIGHT YAY!! i totally missed last weeks episode so if anyone can fill me in coughrachelcough-that would be appreciated. :)

later loves

"event","Wow is this weather GORGEOUS or what?? This is why spring is the best season ever so fall and winter can go kiss its ass!!! Okay anywho today was like, so awesome i think i did somethin good and god is like, bein nice to me. we had shortened periods and then mass ran like, super long so instead of classes bein 25 min they were all like 20 min. 
 theology--sr christie was in a good mood and actually smiled countless times! gasp i think she was high. did some scripture stuff which was kinda cool because we were lookin in the bible and found all these laws like: you will not have intercourse with your fathers sister..it will disgrace the family."" hm ya think??
 english--an hour of english because of the other group goin to mass. we watched this movie on pope j.p 2 which got kinda boring but we started talkin and there were some funny parts where we laughed at some ppl in the movie (not the pope of course. then we went to mass which was cute i guess. the priest did a nice speech about the pope and stuff. 
 science-we didnt have time to learn so the test is moved back to tues (yess!!!) so we just did some labs for the brief 20 minutes. matt was totally random though and walked around the class until mr m was like, matt at least pretend your working. 
 band-can you believe he still made us play today?? i guess its because we totally sucked on monday and he wanted revenge but i mean really, by the time we all sat down and such and then he let the kids who didnt have free out early we got..10 min playin time?? bradley was back yay!!
 computer-grr i despise this class..finance project with danielle which made it a smidge better though :) we officially live in a trailer park with no toilets tehe.
 history-mrs gash is soo awesome!! i know i already said that but she is soo funny and me and colleen are def. makin a book of all the stuff she says in that class. today we were talkin about the mongols in china and shes like, these ppl are total barbarians. the lines of the day have to be ""wouldnt you be scared if the guy you just shot with an arrow just pulls it out and throws it back??""  and  ""yeah nothin you can throw at these guys would scare them--i mean, they bathe in pony urine for heavens sake!!"" 

o ok i gotta go but the rest of the day was boring and then badminton was cancelled so we all just hung out outside.oh my god kevin and me and colleen had such gross convos!! we pictured the guy gettin his head stuck..yeaaahh--lot of confusion goin on.ill just say that i keep tryin to like someone more than i really do. i know that draggin it out much longer wont do good for anyone but i need to make a choice soon!!! plus theres some other kid that i might be watchin more..and they both got good qualities ya know? i think i gotta do the good ol' pros and cons list lol.  homework time then possibly runnin? bye

"event","The fact that I actually enjoy school is so pathetic right? I mean, if it wasnt for homework and wakin up at 6;15 I wouldnt be countin down the days till summer cough46cough. But school was fun today::

English--good way to start the first day back. talked for awhile about vacation and then discussed TKM. blah i still think its a boring book but ms. c makes it survivable. dontchya love that kinda teacher??
Theology--talked for half the period about the pope and all that jazz. i think she loved him shhh...anywhoo then some ppl did their oral reports
Science--psh like we actually got work done..we talked about college recommendations for some reason and then we talked about all this damage done by the storm and such. in other words me and shanelle talked while the class was stupid
band--we totally sucked today AND bradley wasnt here to mr engel was all pissy when i asked him to go out to get the music folder (which is usually bradleys job). but unlike some teachers he doesnt throw things in anger cough. sat next to susan though and she made me laugh and we talked about mr engel gettin drunk tehe.
free-sat with colleen danielle and charlie. hmm i dont think anythin really funny happened but i always like E free with them :)
History-okay mrs gash is officially my favorite teacher like, ever. she was readin us this article about statistics on how our generation compared to the 70's isnt that bad. the only statistic that we had higher (we were lower in violence, pregnancies, and drug use) yeah so we were only higher in obessity haha. ""so you guys make good moral decisions and you arent violent...but your fat.""
math-ATE M&M'S WITH SERENA!!! <333 our first day back from lent and we attacked ms reganato for our candy back. made jokes about her and mr dillon in the back and smart assed joseph..aka the usual. 0:)
spanish-or should i say espanol? tehe ok lame..anyways it was very boring but we talked more about the pope and theres gonna b a mass on wed (shortened periods yay) i know it sounds horrible that im rejoicin over a dead man but dont get me wrong-i had nothin against the guy. in fact i think he was quite nice and very brave and all that jazz. ill even pay attention at the mass even though natalee and mike will be there. 

after school went to badminton with colleen. we mostly just sat there are rotated playin matches, doin lineman, and scoring. i talked with kim and she is soo awesome. we watch like all the same shows and we both think that braden is stupid, karen and jack are awesome, raymond is funny and o.c. is gaaayy!!! very cool..anywho got a game tomorrow at 4 so i should be home around 6;30-7ish. gotta go get some ice cream and get ready for summerland. im totally backed up on shows because i taped desperate housewives last night but i dont know when im gonna get to watch it!! :(

"event","I dont think I've evr had such a stressful day in my entire life!!! I guess thats what you get for tryin to be nice huh? Okay I was supposed to go to Charlies with Colleen and Natalee to just hang out and watch some movies. But I had already said id babysit that night for my aunt and two little cousins. (jack=6 months maria-8 yrs) Bein the awesome older cousin i am i said no to charlies and i went to babysit with my sister. *sigh* jack was sooo cranky because of his cold and incoming teeth that he cried--no wait--screamed for about a half hour straight. I let him wear himself out and then by 8 he was asleep..not for long though oooo no. He woke up around 9ish for his bottle, which i readily gave him, and then he was still so tired and just layed in my arms to i thought, o ill bring him back up to his crib. Wrong idea. The minute i got into his room he started flippin out again and was workin himself up. So again for about another half hour i just walked him around--gettin a major headache and back ache--until he quieted himself down. Keyword quieted..not asleep...quieted. So i rocked him waitin for him to doze..nothing. *sigh* next crisis comes..my mom calls. Turns out we have a gas leak..A FRIGGIN GAS LEAK in our house..so my mom drives over with snickers while my dad waits for some kinda company to come over and inspect. The dogs (snickers and marias dog buddy) are goin nuts, the baby is crying, and im havin a minor panic attack. It had been such a long night and to think i could have actually been enjoying myself on my last night of vacation. Well we cant sleep in our house because theres a leak in the wall or somethin like that so my mom, dad, sister, and me all have to sleep at my aunts house. They dont have a guest room because they turned it into jacks room. My sister shares a bed with maria, my mom and dad take a pull out bed in the couch, which leaves me either the floor in jacks room or marias room--i took marias thinking that jack would wake up crying--again, wrong choice. maria has a hardwood floor and she happens to SNORE VERY LOUDLY. so i slept HORRIBLY, my back hurts, i have a headache, and im miserable.

on top of all this im pissed at some friends. we've been friends for a long time and it seems like if i had never met them they would be totally indifferent. i dont think that made sense..but i just feel like some friends and i have been growin apart and as well as bein a little sad, i kinda realize i dont need them anymore. isnt that sad?

well back to school tomorrow..this was my last vacation till summer and up until yesterday i had a good time, some days i just hung around the house but you need that sometimes. i miss some people who have been gone all vacation and i miss some classes too (shocking i know). i just hope the last 47 days of school go by quickly because i cant wait for summer. I think i should call this the travelin summer..or the friends-i-dont-see summer because im gonna be in different states half the time. as well as goin to austin and possibly surprisin someone somewhere else (shh) im goin to penn. for a week to visit lisa and my family wants to go to virginia (or west virginia?) for a week to visit my aunt and uncle. the plans for oklahoma dont look too good at the moment (o snap...)

yeupp so im gonna go drown in sorrow (actually i kinda cheered myself up within the last few minutes). goin to find some lunch

"event","Okay i WAS gonna write about my day but now im fumming over somethin that happened an hour or so ago so thats gonna b it. If anyone is sick of hearing me bitch about my parents ruining my life i suggest you stop reading this. If you think I'm bein dramatic, dont even bother to go any further because these are the two key things i gotta write about. 

Oh also if for any reason your sick of hearin me bitch about NY. nothin against my friends here bc i heart you all. ok this is what happened, i found out one of my BFFLS in dallas is moving back to cali. she seems happy about it and at first im like, sweet i can go out to cali. then i was lookin thru all these cute old pix of me and her (elena) when i lived there and i was like goin down memory lane ya know? It hit me that since i moved, we grew apart soooooo much. when i lived there we were INSEPERABLE! wed ride our bikes to school and back, play at one of our houses, possibly have dinner together. wed always see each other on weekends and in summer we always went to the public pool and end up stayin there all day and just orderin pizza or somethin. her house was the only one id sleep over at because her parents were like my second parents. but since i moved the emails and letters havent come too often, we barely talk on the phone and theres always those awkward silences when we finally see each other. key word there is finally. we barely see each other. and this applies for all my friends that ive left over the yrs. so now when i think of it, her movin to cali is jsut makin it worse bc now theres one less person to see in dallas. i dont think my mom wants to go all the way to cali just for a few days with them. :( i was in this horrible mood and then my mom is gettin all bitchy so i end up sayin, uve already ruined my life enough so just leave me alone. its true because we always gotta pack up and leave even when im perfectly happy. i know i sound selfish but they gotta think of their kids more sometimes too right? now that we are here and i complain shes like, we cant move bc it would crush jaclyn...FIEWFHBEJHFEUWH ok so now that JACLYN likes it we have to stay? jaclyn loved dallas, yd we leave there?? im sure she would have loved austin, yd we have to leave there? I loved austin, i loved dallas but NOOO now that JACLYN is happy we are screwed. i told her bits and pieces of this thinkin and she yelled, called me inconsiderate towards others, and grounded me. nice huh? realy bitch for ya. *sigh* well whatever idc. bc i know i made her unhappy and this causes me some amount of happiness (pathetic i know). 

i know that one day when im old, living in my perfect house, in the perfect town, with my perfect husband, im gonna look back on my childhood and b like, damn it sucked ass. and ill know who to blame. if ur thinkin i have me to blame you didnt read this entry right so go back and read it again..no my parents. bc if id had a say in this, id still b bak in austin.

on that note, im goin to bed, later babes"

My sister woke me up at 8 and i wanted ot kill her, then we looked for easter eggs *i found more considerin i helped hide them*. i got sweet home alabama on dvd, candy, gum, money etc. then we went to church, and drove to westchester. my aunts house at first sucked because joe and albert were bein total asses (joe was bein all nasty and callin me a bitch so i had to give him a good whoopin). they blasted this gay heavy metal and played playstation (uhh how old is albert? like 20??). so elena and i were bored for awhile and anytime we'd sing along to the heavy metal (I WANNA BE HEARD!!!!) they would yell at us. psh wuts the good of music if you cant sing and dance along?? Later though albert drove us to starbucks and got all the drinks free since he works there. Finally tried a caramel machiato (sp?)Eh it was ok..nothin special. I think tea is better than coffee no offense. Anywho then we stayed a lil longer and then came home around 10 somethin. I watched sweet home alabama and then read this weird magazine till about 1;30..idk why but i wasnt tired..or maybe iw as over tired. whatever. either way i woke up this mornin around 945 to the sound of my dog goin nuts. why is everyone determined not to let me sleep?? 

  Today is so stupid!!! Its a long story but charlie was supposed to come to the movies with me kenzi mike and nicole but now my mom is like, o he has to invite u somewhere first..which he cant bc he just got bak from japan. so now i had to tell him the movie thing didnt work out and maybe kenzi nicole mike and i will still go. if not, im sorry you guys!!!! 

  Off all this week so if ya wanna make plans call the house. I definitley wanna go spring shoppin (even tho its supposed to rain like 75 percent of the week).

"event","Happy day-before-easter!! I actually dont really want it to be easter because i have to wear this dress in cold awful weather, i have to wake up early to go to church and drive 3 hours to my aunts house to see my horrible family. OK they arent horrible but it seems like everythin my cousins do annoys me and my older cousins seem to think they are too cool to talk to me. Annnywhoo...I dont remember what I wrote last. OK thurs, my aunt and cousins came over, they bothered me for a couple of hours and then went home. I did some spring cleanin and rearranged room furniture. Then colleen came over and we watched monte python (awesome movie) and ella enchanted (only we can take a G rated movie and make it R). then we talked until 3 and slept till 11. we had some pancakes, watched spongebob the movie and drove her home. (I miss her already *sigh*) My mom and i did some last min. easter shoppin and then we picked up nicole. we just hung out awhile and watched chicago. i now officially heart that movie. the music and dancin was kickin. i definitley should have lived in that time period. jazz, men and booze..nice. oh and i now like richard gear (sp?) and hate catherine zeta-jones. me and nicole did some awesome dancin btw. i think in another life i was a showgirl haha.
 today i did some easter baking (and eatin tehe) and decorated eggs. then i went out around 6 with chrissy. we went to starbucks and then went into walgreens where we got some candy. (took us about 20 min btw). we ended up gettin dinner which included chips, drinks and gummi worms :) then we went back into starbucks with our ""dinner"" and talked about how parents do not understand us haha. Oh and sam was there!! i miss sammy :(
 monday charlie is home :) so we are probably gonna do somethin. im hopin for a movie at lowes with kenzi mike and nicole (chrissy?). tues idk wut im doin, wed im gonna get together with serena and have our choco party! thurs im goin to the movies with colleen and havin a fondu party, and then the rest of the week idk..prob gonna do some spring shoppin and hopefully see natalee and christina when they get back from europe! lucky byotches.

i must go shower and make myself look pretty for tomorrow (this may take awhile *sigh*)

 history-presentations. ""pimp my hajj"" haha mrs gash is so cool!!
 english-macbeth test..wow part one was so easy!! ok yeah we still gotta do the essay tomorrow but no biggie. 
 theology-sub..mr somethin or other that natalee thought was hot. eh he wasnt bad. he was pretty funny though. we were supposed to have a vocab quiz and he gave us almost all the answers. hes ok in my book lol. 

after school me colleen natalee and christina wrapped lockers then hung out in the caf with charlie. O-M-L we had the most random, perverted, horny convo EVER. seriously..it was like, wow soo out there. then at 5 me and colleen went to badminton tryouts!! yay we soo rocked babe! speakin of colleen rocking, happy ides of march! this was the day caesar was murdered. im gonna write down the story colleen wrote me in her note:::

""Miss Colleen's History of the Ides of March. Long long ago..in a galaxy far far away...oh wait, wrong story. Okay so there was this hottie named Caesar, and he was all like, 'I'm the ultimate ruler of Rome'. because well..he was. he was a cool dude who got lots of grls every night and everyone liked him. until...that fateful day..when..he wore....PURPLE!! (gasp dum dum dum!!) Now all of his peeps and homeies got all 'W-T-F' because purple is the color of the gods and their all like..hes not a god! WTF? and then it occured to them that he thought of himself as a god and they thought 'oh man! dudes we gotta put a stop to this'..LETS KILL HIM! so they warned him and waited till the ides of march and at the end of the day caesar said 'see nothin bad happened today' then he walked his sexy body into parliment and WHAM! no more sexy caesar. 'twas quite sad because his bffl Brutu stabbed him along with all the others which is why SC (sexy caesar) last words were 'e tu, brute?' which means and you brutus? and he bled and there was gore...the end.""

haha i love her!! ""caesar was like, gr gr! caesar was like ah ah! e tu brute e tu brute?!"" ;P my cripple-hopping, street laying, burping fth. muAh!

ok yeah im soo excited about vacay bc its charlie's bday and we r all goin to his o so awesome party. :) I love thai!! haha that restaurant was awesome though. spicy baby!! and IM GOIN TO EUROPE!! we brought in the check last night :))))))))))))) we get to climb the leaning tower, take a sleigh ride in the mts. of austria, have a night time gondola ride in venice, and shop!!!

""he was out gettin his chalupas!!""

"event","Hm today was a bit of a sucky day. A new dilemma started..kinda today i guess. Dunno what I'm gonna do but I wont put it in here because the person(s) it ivolves could read it..Anywho::

Free-Natalee and Kat weren't there so I was basically alone. :( Studied in the library for a bit and then switched to the cafeteria and bought myself breakfast. Then I listened to some random kid play his guitar..he wasnt half bad. I thought of throwin some cash into his case haha but then I would have lost more money.
English-Natalee came in yay! Her bus had been in traffic b/c they closed some of 110 bc of ice..in case anyone was wondering..Kinda funny class, but a lil annoying. Nick was so immature and he took up half the period gettin into trouble. Then we talked about that show boiling points on mtv, assassins, ""geo. isolation"", and finally got to do some vocab. For a teacher who is assigning a 300 word vocab test at the end of the year, shes takin her merry time teachin the words lol. Oh and we discovered that Ms. C's sister's old college roomate was Oswald's niece (he killed JFK)
Science-Once again got off topic. We talked about snipers, shotguns, and Mr. M killin deers. Trish was heartbroken to hear her live kills poor defensless animals for fun. Ian called on me for a question and he thought I didnt know the answer b/c I wasnt makin eye contact but that was just bc I was readin Natalees letter ;) I got the quest. right btw..
Free-Woooww me, colleen, natalee and angela were like, so drunk ""minus the alcohol"" as natalee put it. My poor oreo cookies...OO NO!! *crushes them on table*
Another Free-ate with Danielle and Megan. Nothin really interestin here. cough
History-Reviewed for test on Islam and such..did anyone know the Taj Mahal is actually a tomb? Hm wouldnt have guessed..
Spanish-classwork was boring but Ryan and I got in trouble because he kept askin me what 6 % of 99 cents was and me and katie were like, hysterical. It wasnt even that funny but so random. 
Math-Went over somethin.. idk. Serena, Joseph and I talked a lot and Serena and I teamed up against him. He smells so much better with my sunflower perfume on..we also laughed a lot about Serena's boy trouble...GIVE HIM YOUR PEN!! And serena announced randomly that some kid like beheaded his dad with a sword haah!!! i luv that grl

was gonna stay after for SALT but I have to go tomorrow because we gotta go shoe shoppin..yay. O-M-L my dad is driving us to the dance *hangs self* fhnirfhnwe Gotta go do homework..muah"

"event","I HATE SNOW!!!! grrr 7-12 inches by tomorrow morning..can i please die now? the only good thing is that there is a 90 somethin percent chance that we will have no school manana. thats why im not doin my homework..jk. woot well today was ok. i had to wake up a bit earlier than usual because my mom never picked up my blazer from the dry cleaner so my dad and ihad to go pick it up. 
wow i didnt remember what day it was..sadly it was day 4 (i thought it was day 5 which meant i would have three frees..no such luck)

spanish-kinda boring. except when sra. scala did a dance because her son got married..freaky
math-very boring. me and serena talked most of the time. about chocolate, the cotillion, etc.
science-VERY boring. we talked about..clouds and such. shanelle was there today though so we talked about summerland and the oscars last night.
band-oml i was soo worried that i was gonna get detention because i forgot my mouthpiece at home but mr engel was like, strangely nice today and just let me sit there. most of the saxes just sat there neways. we counted..we have 147 measures of rest throughout the barber of seville. wow i luv jim..and will!! my courting pal 
free-finally! woot sat with danielle, serena, s squared and kristen. kristen watched summerland too! wow so much in common :) i must see ray this weekend!! jamie foxx is my homeboy hahaa
history-wow that was some funny stuff right there!! we talked a lot and joe and nick were like, spaced out (as usual). nick had a question about turkey and mrs gash tried to make up an antonym (dont ask). ""thats like askin whats more like an orange, ice or a rock."" nick was like, ice, its edible..haha hes funny. 
theology-boring
english-so funny! ms. c told us stories about her trip to italy and we took up most of the period just talking. she was juliet on her balcony, there was a messed up woman throwin wine, and all the kids got sick..nice!

all these kids came up to me and were like, hey i like ur hair! i didnt think it was that different but i guess these kids are just too nice!! cross your fingers for snow day tomorrow.

"event","Hm where did I leave off last time? Okay well I'll start on saturday. I had my lil cousin brandon's baptism in nj so we went to my cousin's wife's parent's house (whoa thats a thinker). Pretty boring but the house was really nice. Really old and big. Anywhoo that night my parents went out to dinner with my aunt and uncle and my cousin Jess and I stayed at her house and babysat for our sisters. I wouldnt call sittin on the couch and forcing them to bake us cookies counts as babysittin but w/e. We laughed soo much when we remembered the weekend they spent at our house and the time we stayed up till 3 am talkin about random stuff. ""crazy bitch i'd do him"" haha. sunday kenzi and nicole came over and we watched notebook and just hung out. i had to beat the crap outta kenzi to get some info outta her haha. monday i felt a lil sick in the morning but i felt better by about 3ish so i went dress shoppin with colleen. we didnt find our dresses yet bc we r very critical (psh) but we had fun tryin on the dresses and bein models lol. blah i did absolutely nothin today but i think i needed the rest day you know? i had a dentist appt. and then i just came home and read this scary mystery book. i will now not go upstairs alone and check my closet for a psycho murderer.

we got MORE snow yesterday *hangs self* i really cant wait for spring/summer. this summer is gonna be sooo much fun. travelin all over the place with jess, julie and rachel!!

"event","Yay no more drama in school! Well not too much. and now I got a week off! Yeah so today was fun. I didnt have school so I got to sleep till 9ish. But I had a hair appt @ 10;30 and I had to shower and dry it before I went (stupid isnt it?). But I reeally like my haircut/color. Then my mom took me out to lunch and I went to SHS to surprise ppl. Okay it wasnt that much of a surprise bc I told most ppl yesterday. W/e Chrissy, Nick, Kenzi and me stayed after to watch Kenzi's play practice. Seussical? It was..interesting. Omgsh I missed Nick! Lol hes awesome. Hes sprayed his cologne all over my sweatshirt so I can still smell him *sniffs* The play was..interesting lol. Lets say there was a lot more drama goin on off stage but Chrissy and I kept ourselves occupied tehe. Then to cheer Kenz up we took her to Starbucks. Our Three Amigos! Haha. 

Ew tomorrow is gonna be so boring. I have to get up early (again) and get all dressed up to drive to NJ for a baptism. Then my cousin Jess and I have to babysit our siblings while our wonderful parents go out to dinner. Np though. We are gonna watch Notebook like 4783467482390 times and make tons of junk food. No solid plans for the rest of the week except for some possible dress shoppin'. So make sure to call me! Must go watch Monk now...later

I thought best friends were for talking to about everything.  To be there when you needed them.  To help you through the moments that were most hurtful, the most hard, to be your crying shoulder when you needed one.  I guess I was wrong.  Again.  This time, it's finally over.  I don't really know what that means at this point, but it seems to me like things have changed with people.  This damn school, always about drama.  Nothing more.  Ocasionally, a fun time here and there, but it doesn't really seem possible with all the negative shit that is going on right now.  I don't know if this means anything to anyone else, but I think things need to change.  I think people need to just understand that everyone is different.  Friends will tell you what is going on in their life.  TRUE friends will ask you what they can do to make it better.  Friends will ask if you want to talk.  TRUE friends will say, for how long?  catch my drift?

No one knows what it's like to be the bad man,
to be the sad man, behind blue eyes
no one knows what it's like to be hated,
to be fated

No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
like i do, I BLAME YOU
NO one bites back as hard, from their anger
none of my pain woe can show through.

To live the life I live, seems like a curse at the moment.  It seems like people hate me.  Maybe they do, but all I can say, is be careful what you say, what you act like, because actions and words hurt people, and sometimes those people don't feel like forgiving for a

"event","Yesterday, Sunday, was a kind of exciting day.  There was a lot of talk about homecoming the night before last.  There was a lot of talk especially about all the drinking that came up and how things were going to be handled for those who got caught and who would get in trouble.  However, someone told me that he/she knew only of one person that was drinking for sure, and I had heard there were approximately 3 or 4.  He/she told me that if they didn't have proof, they couldn't bust the person for anything that was not ordinary.  

Before all that talk of the homecoming events, I did end up getting to go to the college fair in  Cincinnati.  After driving around for approximately and hour looking for a place to park (it was very difficult indeed because there was a Reds game and a Bengals game), we finally pulled into a parking garage that wasn't full and got into the fair.  The fair was really really huge, and I had no idea where to start, so my mom and I just ended up walking the isles.  It was very interesting indeed.

Today is going to be a very big day for me.  This morning, in about 10 min. I have to leave to go to the doctor to check about my skin cancer.  My mom and I are both worried sick, wondering if it is going to be controllable.  I am hoping for the best.  She is hoping for the best.  We all are.

That's all for now."

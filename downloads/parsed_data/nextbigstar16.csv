"event","Last night I went to my Drama Departments annual Spotlight Awards. It was my first time going so I did not know what to expect. The theme was Las Vegas. I was a Trophy Monkey, the person who hands out the trophies. That was fun. Everyone said that I was the best dressed. It was sort of shocking because I decided what outfit to wear at the last minute. And the best part of all was that I won an award. I was totally not expecting it at all. My drama teacher picked me a the overall actor in my drama class. I am so happy, and then I am so tired. I stayed up really late last night and now I have a killer headache. I just want to go back to sleep. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ."

"event","<P><STRONG>I just got back from the orthodontist. They hurt me so much. They get paid to cause ppl pain. The good thing is that I get my braces off in about 4 weeks.&nbsp; I can't wait....well yes I can, considering I have been waiting 5 years to get them off.&nbsp; Very, Very long story and I don not want to get into it.&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>My mom was being such a butt today. She would not let me go over to my friend's house.....TO DO HOMEWORK!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; And honest to gosh it was to do homeword.&nbsp; Seriously, she expects me to keep straight A's without any help at all. Is that possible?&nbsp; I mean even smart ppl need help once in a while.&nbsp; And if I do not get straight A's then I won't be able to do any more plays.&nbsp; My parents are really strict.&nbsp; Just because they did not make the grade does not mean that we have to be punishe for it. Well, I am going to take my anger out on something else now.! Bye.</STRONG></P>"

"event","Nooooo! I'm back... but somehow it's a relief, i was going mad with all that i <i>didn't</i> have to do. But is it just me? I come home soooo tired, I just don't want to do homework. And yes, I have government homework. But there's a loooot more to come. I feel like drawing wings. Eagle wings, raven wings... I want to draw wings! ^^ Lol, I love to draw... but anime and all that CG stuff, I get kind of sick of it. I'm not talking about <i>manga</i>, i mean <i>anime</i>. If you visit deviantart, you'd be surprised how little traditional art is posted there(as in not computer-drawn). So i really hate CG at the mo, I'm sick of it! XD And all the anime artists there do the exact same thing, it's not even funny. I hate anime pretty much, I only like some <i>japanese</i> ones now(not the american wanabes on DA XD that's who I'm talking about). I can't completely say i dislike anime... One of the Anime Studios I adore is Studio Gibli. They're works(Spirited Away, and that Kiki one... oh and Mononoke) are really impressive. They're the japanese Disney! :P They are at the moment in the progress of adapting a really great book to the movies! Their most recent project is called Howl's Moving Castle, a book by british author Diana Wynne Jones. I looooved this book, I'm in love with Jones' style. It's a little like Harry Potter, so if you like HP, i recommend DWJ's books to you! :D Here's some previews of the upcoming movie conversion I found on the net and Gibli site(which i couldn't read! doh! XD). 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/missmnmsfreak/holws.bmp"">
This is the poster for the movie. And yes, the heroine of the story is an old woman(named Sophie). :) It's more cartoony than I had invisioned when reading the book, but having seen Gibli's older work, I'm sure it'll be awesome anyway. :)

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/missmnmsfreak/howls2.jpg"">
Eee, so cool! But I don't really know who the guy standing next to her is yet... oh now i know! hehehe... not saying. :P

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v155/missmnmsfreak/howls3.jpg"">
Yay! Howl is on this pic! He's supposedly a really good looking rebelish guy... (he's the one with blonde hair). Yeah, a little dissapointed that he looks so much like a prince, but this is just one pic, so we'll have to wait and see how he turns out in the movie. By the way, he's meant to be Welsh. ;)

That's all the Howl pics I have to show you... but I have more! Another movie I'm anticipating(that is also japanese) is the FFVII movie! XD Arrg, I'm such a dork, but hey, it's amazing what japanese people can do with animated movies.
Yes... FFVII is a computer animated movie! Even better-looking than Finding Nemo! And the guys... they're so damn hot! XD

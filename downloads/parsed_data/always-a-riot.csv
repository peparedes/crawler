"event","<p><br /><span style=""font-size: medium""><strong>It has been a very long time. I&nbsp;figured I need to try harder. The past few days have been a blur really. I&nbsp;am living and doing well but I feel as though I am being selfish.I feel so happy that I am not in Ridgecrest anymore and letting it suck my life away from me but I feel guilty in the way that I can't prevent anyone else from that fate. The first person of my Graduating class died not but a couple days ago. It almost feels like the start of a countdown clock. He was the first and i doubt he will be the last sadly. Its like my grandmother remarked recently to my mother that &quot;your father and I&nbsp;remember when we were signing guestbooks for weddings and now we find ourselves signing them for mournings..&quot; She is much older and wiser than I&nbsp;but it is still very unsettling to realize that i have so many decades to go and I will be in the very same position as her. Why so soon? I&nbsp;can't help but feel a sort of &quot;survivors guilt&quot;&nbsp;as Ben put it. Maybe I should have kept better contact, been a better friend,or simply been more involved. It can't be retraced now all you can do is move forward and alter yourself in order to learn from this experience. I&nbsp;still as everyone else probably does find this lesson to be very unfair. Still in the same instance this is life and this is how the game is played you lose and you gain. <br />Anyhow just wanted to clear my mind. <br /></strong></span></p>"

"event","hello.the last week has been okay.i am getting ove the fact of ""well maybe i should be the nice one and appologize"" for the fact that i ALWAYS appologize.i am talking about the situation with my friends.My little group has split and we are going our seperate ways. bummer?...yes. but i think our problem is we don't know who's fault it is. in my oppinion i think we are all pretty damn guilty....i've just come to that conclusion .But maybe one of these days we will stop acting like two-year-olds and move on to 10th grade.that would be a lovely day. but i don't want to forgive anyone until i see change or until everyone is aware of how they act.I think we are all stubbourn brats so that'll never happen.okay enough about that. i'm moving on and feeling better.lately i've been with my friends michelle and scott.well michelle has always been there but scott is a new character.He's working on making me less movie iliterate.i have to start from scratch and get new band members considering the friends that left happened to be half the band.so i'm playing solo for a while or i'll jam with Anthony (the drummer)...sometime. thats whats happened......its all been soooo much fun! haha .goodbye

"event","hello, today was a pretty bad day...for numerous reasons.first off i woke up this morning with the worst throbbing headache in the world!it was to the point where i thought i heard it in  my ears!but i got over it.then i had to look for every single sock in my room because my dad accused me of taking his....which i didn't!then i find out that michelle messsed up and planned two things for one day.we had planned to watch movies and her and jenny planned to go to magic mountain....magic mountain won lol.so then my dad tells me to not make plans because we are going to his girlfriends house in victoville.i hate doing that!so i scrambled to find anyone to stay with....and that didn't work so i had to go.then i got here and was trapped in the house because 1.)i don't feel like wondering around a place i don't really know that well and 2.)my dad won't take me anywhere because he is watching the 1st world series game.so i sat in the spare bedroom and drew a crazy picture while listening to bright eyes about 4 times...yeah no more bright eyes tonight but hey the picture turned out cool!then i got online talked to katie and kevan(in canada plaing hockey)for a while and then the damn aol kicked me off!i hate aol!and aim! that can die too it only has a couple good purposes for me.and then i called katie and talked to her for a good 1-2 hours and now i am here....still hating this place....still bored as ever!"

"event","well is possibly the best day of the week....Friday!well it wasn't terrible.i had nothing to do in any of my  classes...well except biology grrr...i spent all lunch in that stupid class finishing things but it wasn't too bad. today was eighty's day so everyone dressed up even my biology teacher and she played eighties music....and danced to it (yeah strange).then we had a rally....wow these things are getting quite a bit better. i think as you climb the ladder in high school you gain more pride and school spirit. thats what makes these things better.we still didn't win much of anything...we even lost the float competition.lolthen i went to the football game it was fun like school but with football and some of my friends acting strange as usual.....bad strange. not good strange that'd be my pal misha. and now i am tired so i will be leaving.---holly"

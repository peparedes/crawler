"event","ok so i finally got a new live journal.. and i can honestly say im excited. ok well because NOTHING happend today lets talk about my weekend

friday i had school.. which was its usually HELLish self, but then i had rehersal which i love. that ended at six and then i went right from naz to the high sschool i belong in .. aka peabody high to see "" the unorder of things"", and "" Elephant Man"" BOTH WERE AMAZING!!! its liek i always say .. im the proud mother who goes to support her babies! kyle ashlynd and kris were all amazing... actually everyone was but i was really there for them ... oh, and how cood i forget connie!!! she is truely amazing! then after the show i had i grab ashlynd and run because we had to pick my brother up from the valentines day dance at higgins... and when we got there ... we snuck in!!!!! and danced the night away then kris and kyle showed up and we all danced our butts off. after the final slow song we left .. and then we went to sam's market .. where we almost got shot. on our way home i got in a fight with mom infront of ash and my brother and his friend.. but no one cared apparently.. only i did... ughh as soon as we walked in the door when we got home.. GIRLS NIGHT BEGAN .. where i cant even say all the things we did... but then saturday i had a road lesson with the love of my life FRANK! then i went back to ashlynds where i was surpirsed to see kyle was there! we played weith grace and chip and then we went to browns pond where throo rocks at ice.. i had no idea what an amazing noise it made... so now its my ring tone.. YES I RECORDED IT AND MADE IT MY RING TONE! so now everytime i look at a pond i can think of my best friends..

now here i am sunday and i just got off the phone with my bffl alyssa who is insane today, so this is a shout out for alyssa... my love my valentine!

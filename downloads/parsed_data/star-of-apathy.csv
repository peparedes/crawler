i think i've turned into the biggest bitch ever...unless ive been one for a while..but im starting to notice it more. i get so angry really quickly, and i blame it on my new bosses.
try going from having the coolest/fun job ever with bosses that u love and go to work just to chill with them, to having two douche bags who think they are the shit and know more about the shop then me and the other people who've been working there for a year. fuck that...but they ranked me a 5/5 on employee satisfaction or whatever, and they think im a quite person who keeps to myself.
psssh ya right..im so the opposite..i just donnt like u muthafucka.


mike got a ticket today for peeling off in a parking lot. hahha i feel bad cuz i know whats up.


hmmm besides hanging out with people from work..and working...i have done nothing and i am counting done the days till this semester is over...i dont know it right now..but i will.

im like an inch from finishing my sora costume for halloween..excited? i think so!




my body is weird....cuz i eat one thing a day..for example..i ate a quesadilla for dinner today, and thats it...and i feel sick afterwards...thats been happening all week.
eat nothing all day..then eat something for dinner, and i get a sick feeling in my stomach...fuck this.














my parents are gay cuz they yelled at me for having a dane cook joke for my away message, and they said its ""not nice""

mr.rhys(math teacher) is at the board helping someone figure out a problem, and this guys cell phone rings, and his ring tone was ""ITS PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!"" and expecting my teacher be like.""turn ur phone off"" he started FUCKIN DANCING!!! it was a weird wiggling mixed with disco dancing..and omg...i was dieing laughing.

also my lil sister(being the retard that she is) said i dispunctured her knee....now...i know from the sound of it that dispunctured is not a word..and i told her what an idiot she was...but she insisted on telling me that it was a real word......its sad to think that im the smartest person in my family....and if u dont know...im not smart at all.

"event","i ditched math today...i so did not want to go sit in that class and learn about god knows what.
i think thats bad since ive only been in school 3 or 4 weeks..gaaargh!

instead i stayed at robs house and filmed a rap video with jake, rob and chris to the mos gangsta song eva, ""fruit salad"" by the wiggles.
it was off da hook...rob just needs to get the rest of the footage and edit it with devon..hopefully he'll post it on youtube soon. mwahaha!!!

the 27th&nbsp;is my film screening...well not just for my film, but the whole classes, and anyone is welcomed to come...there will be food!!!
im so nervous since&nbsp;this assignment&nbsp;was an in-camera-edit dealio(which means we had to have the whole film in a chronological order,and with no editing)..so i have no idea on how my film looks or if it even came out correctly. eeeekkkrgh!!!

hmmm...besides that....nothing really has happened."

Although I'm no coffee drinker, the smell of the cookie was heavenly. Taste was not bad either. Note to self: have to remember to toast the hazelnuts 1st.

"event","Kailee's got 2 new flavours on her menu this week - beefy broccoli and watermelon. Loves one but not the other.<br /><br />Minced beef was fried in a non stick pan till no longer pink, then added to a pot of diced broccoli stems and leaves. This was cooked in beef stock for 20min till the broccoli was soft and then blended into a brownish green puree. Looks yucky, smells wonderful and tastes yummy. She loves it.<br /><br />Since the weather's been so hot lately, I have a stash of watermelon in the fridge. Blended some to get watermelon juice, which I used in place of water to make rice cereal for Kailee. I'm surprised she doesn't like it too much since the cereal's nice and sweet.

"event","Have grown a little tired of ang moh salads lately. Yearn for something with a little more punch &amp; crunch. So it's Asian style salads that I turn to for a simple but satisfying lunch.<br /><br />First up is an adaptation of Fish Leong's Thai Style Grilled Pork Salad. I&nbsp;marinaded the ribeye pork in hoisin sauce, shaoxing wine and white pepper for a 1/2 hour. Meanwhile, I cut the cucumber and bell pepper into pinky finger sized slices. Blended together fish sauce, lime juice, bird's eye chilli, garlic, chicken stock, sugar, coriander stem, leaves and roots for the dressing. Put the pork under the broiler and grilled for 10min till cooked. Sliced up cooked pork and arranged over cucumber and bell pepper pieces, poured over dressing, then garnished with mint leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4421990870_9b72b74ce8_m.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />Next I tried an Asian Style Shredded Chicken Salad. Marinaded chicken breast with ginger juice, shaoxing wine, salt and sugar for at least an hour. Chicken was steamed for 10 min, left to cool, then shredded. Cucumber and carrot were cut into batons and shredded chicken placed atop. Dressing was made by boiling some chicken stock with oyster sauce, sugar, pepper and sesame oil. Finished salad with a sprinkling of thinly sliced spring onions and coriander leaves, and chopped toasted peanuts and sesame seeds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4434952078_97bfa41601_m.jpg"" alt="""" />"

"event","The smell of uncooked shrimp paste can be unappetizing to many. Shrimp paste is a common ingredient used in SE Asian cooking, with the different countries having their own variations of this condiment.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia, shrimp paste is made from fermented ground shrimp, sun-dried then cut into fist sized blocks. It is not designed, nor customarily used for immediate consumption and has to be fully cooked prior to consumption since it is raw. It is an essential ingredient in many curries and sauces. <br /><br />However upon cooking, this pungent smell mellows into the background, and becomes an afternote of seafoody goodness. <br /><br />This dish - Steamed Shrimp Paste Pork is a classic example. It's simple to prepare but tasty to eat!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4418880559_153cf68c78_m.jpg"" alt="""" />"

I noticed that she was constipated yesterday and had spiked her milk with lactulose (a laxative). Unfortunately it didn't help and she was in distress as she tried to poo-poo. Her face was all red from the straining, her head &amp; body soaked with perspiration, and she was wailing her lungs out. Left with little choice, I decided to 'shoot a bullet' up her arse! Meaning I stuck a suppository into her rectum. Thank goodness it worked and she managed to do her business 2 hours later. After some straining &amp;&nbsp;more crying from her, she squeezed out 3 pinky sized little pieces of poop that's the texture of hard plasticine. Poor girl burst some blood vessels in the progress too. 

I am trying to determine if this is due to a change in milk powder (from Similac 1 to Similac 2), a changed from rice based cereal to a wheat based one or simply an increase in the amount of solids taken. Is either pumpkin or broccoli heaty? How can I make her drink more water without resorting to spiking it with fruit juices? Humm, questions questions questions...

I hope this successful 'clearing' means I get my happy, good-natured girl back, instead of the moody constipated one! Fingers crossed..."

Bought half a pumpkin from the market. Chopped it up and cooked it with a cup of water for about 25min till soft. Blasted it up in the blender and poured the mixture into an ice cube tray and froze it. Defrosted a cube at feeding time only for Kailee to reject my mashed pumpkin! Was so dejected! Discovered that it was still slightly fibrous. The picky little thing is used to super smooth foods. Urrgh.&nbsp; Proceeded to strain the mixture through a sieve, then found that the mixture was now too thick. The poor girl could barely swallow. Had to thin the consistency down with hot water, but by then Kailee was totally disinterested in eating. *Urrgh* Will try again this afternoon. Have to persevere!

Location was the Floral &amp; Forest Walk sections of the Southern Ridges Walk (<a href=""http://www.nparks.gov.sg/southernridges.html"">http://www.nparks.gov.sg/southernridges.html</a>&nbsp;). Yes, I know it's a terrible disadvantage for him to be using a point &amp; shoot while I use a DSLR! Hehe...&nbsp;<br /><br />Sunday turned out to be cloudy, which wasn't perfect for a photography sesson but it made for an thoroughly enjoyable walk.

"event","Joined Red Scuba on their Kuantan Wreck Live-on-Board over the Vesak Day weekend. Spent 4 days 3 nights on MV Seabourne. Have to say hubby &amp; I were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food served on board! :) Our tummies were well satisfied.<br /><br />Dived at various Tioman sites on the way up to Kuantan but the highlight of the trip was definitely Kuantan Wreck. It's a Japanese&nbsp;oil cargo ship that was sunk in the mid 1970s. I was initially apprehensive about a wreck dive cos have been watching too many Hollywood movies where divers get lost in the eerie ship filled with dead bodies everywhere! Felt a little letdown when was told that there will not be any diving inside the wreck as sections of it have collasped already. The visibility was superb - almost 20m! Tons of fishes and marine life. Thoroughly enjoyed this site!<br /><br />Perhaps it was due to the full moon, but the surf was rather bad. Quite a few divers didn't manage to get out of their rooms for the whole day! Fortunately both hubby &amp; I are comfortable travelling over water. Not a bad way to spend a long weekend! :)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3043/2510969924_db35541c63_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2384/2510137015_ddb45ca811_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2510140433_784a6a0f7f_m.jpg"" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3069/2510985060_1c44b39e31_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2510152205_4539e91a5e_m.jpg"" /> <img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3018/2510984618_9f0cc09f90_m.jpg"" />"

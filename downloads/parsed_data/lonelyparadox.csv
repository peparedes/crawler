Nathan called me up and mentioned this cheap used bike sale not to far away from where I&nbsp;was, so Nate and I&nbsp;decided to check it out (he needs a bike too). When we got there I&nbsp;saw this red and white schwinn road bike, I&nbsp;fell in love. I&nbsp;asked the guy if I&nbsp;could test ride it and he said yes, and he then offered to lower the seat a little for me, but since i'm a big, strong man with an ego, i declined. Twenty feet later I&nbsp;was lying on the sidewalk with the bike on top of me.... Everyone there died laughing at me, and Nate said he would never let me live it down... I bought the bike twenty minutes later.

It wreaks havoc on relationships, and I've seen people that have been emotionally devastated by the smallest change. Personally I am so scared of change. In less than two months I move six hours away to a college of 50,000 people. I don't have housing yet. Yeah, that's right, I leave in two months and I don't know where I'm living. I don't know who my roommate will be, or how many I'm going to have... I am scared to death. I am so excited, but scared to death.&nbsp; I know some of you guys are going off also, and I am pretty sure we are all feeling a little like this. What about those people we leave behind? I mean, I am losing my rock concert buddy, my trust issues buddy, my bubbling fountain of sarcasm buddy,&nbsp; my brother, my tie dye compadre, and so many more... I'm really quite worried about making friends at college...yeah that elementary school fear is totally resurfacing in college. <br /><br />Oh, and what I'll experience at college..... that scares me the most, UF is <u><b>so</b></u> different from Rocky, I mean they had little mini-seminars on partying/alcohol-ing... and how to <b>get away with it</b>..... And SEX, Dear God... they treated it like it was simply a social activity in which you get to know people...<br /><br />I am scared.."

"event","<div align=""right"">got back from Jr/Sr today...it was ok, last year was better. <br />stiff and sore, but feeling pretty good.<br /></div><br /><div align=""left"" class=""ljcut"" text=""the urgency of sound""> I cannot stand all the liars, the masks, the false personas that the people put on at our school. I cannot stand the favoritism that our school shows to the students that have long standing history in the school, the good old boy system. <br /> <br /> I loved how one of the first things said on the trip was that those of us from small families won't know what's it's like to ""take one for the team"" like those kids from the bigger families, and that we all need to work to not get on each others nerves and make concessions, the whole ""don't drive your brother to sin"" thing. on the way home I experienced the utter depravity of our school, I was in the back of the bus with a guy that was easily angered, and some of the people from predominant families were mercilessly doing things just to anger him, i had to keep talking the poor guy out of a rage so that he wouldn't kill somebody. the sad thing is that a teacher was near by, but wouldn't do anything about it....<br /> <br /> Our school judges people on how much they are liked most of the time rather than what their actions dictate them to be like. Some people get some many chances past what should be given to them, while others are booted out with no chance. The speaks, but they don't always hear what they are saying.<br /> <br />if only our faculty could be made aware, but alas they know....they are the dealers, they are the killers...to even mention the fact that favoritism might be a part of the school would be the greatest sin against our beloved sanitorium... <br /><br />I grow tired of the duplicity<br /><br />but some still exist that will stand against the injustice in our school, standing firmly on their beliefs. for those of you that do, thanks.</div> <br /><div align=""center""><font size=""1"">Half the words don't mean a thing,</font><br /><font size=""1"">And I know that I won't be satisfied.</font><br /><font size=""1"">So why, try ignoring him.</font><br /><font size=""1"">Make it a dirt dance floor again.</font><br /><font size=""1"">Say your prayers and stomp it out,</font><br /> </div>"

"event","Pep band was pretty cool today, but thankfully it was Friday... I am really glad to be done with the first week...

I keep coming back to this one thought, this one catch. I get away from it for awhile, then somehow end up right back at it. I love how all things point away, but I end up right back where I started. Why? that's all I want to know.

I embrace this year, all it's pains, it's problems, it's joys, it's sadness, and I will enjoy every moment of it, as well as make the most of it. That's what I have decided."

"event","Today was the ""first day of school,"" our last first day of school... 
Next year about this time it will be our first day of college... 
I am very excited about this year, friends, music, well...just life in general.. but as much as everyone says this is just the beginning of our lives, it is also an ending... people we are close to we might not see for five, ten years.... to some people we might become a fond memory, or a bitter one... Some of us will be glad to leave, some of us will hate to go... some of us will leave and never comeback, some of us will leave only to return because we have no place else to go...&nbsp; 
But we will always remember this senior year, the things we didn't do, the things we wanted to do, and the things we did... 

do you: jenn, amanda, katie, ashley, beccy, catie, feel the same way towards any aspect of this?


other than my random thoughts above^ today was pretty cool, I showed up and found out that I was group leader, I pulled out some sweet moves during today's scavenger hunt... but that's about all."

"event","Not much is going on right now, I have to go to Pensacola tomorrow for an appointment. Then Wednesday is picture day. I still have to read that C.S. Lewis book..


I can't get to sleep
 I think about the implications
 Of diving in too deep
 And possibly the complications
 
 Especially at night
 I worry over situations
 I know I'll be alright
 Perhaps it's just imagination"

I worked a ten hour day, on a rock wall, moon bounce, bungee run, and a barrel roll thing... Mel randomly stopped by, she caught me right when I was getting sick. It was...&nbsp;

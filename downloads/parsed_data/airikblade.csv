"event","I'm incredibly cynical about politics.  For a long time I've firmly believed that anyone involved in politics was a disgusting scum-bag interested in how much they could suck off the government tit, which is, of course, fed by the tax-payers of this country.  I've long viewed them all as dishonest, self-serving, sickening, putrescent, vomitous leeches, not worth all of my air that they're breathing.  I'd love to just kick them all out of office and make them do an honest day's work - like mopping up the jizz in a whorehouse - or, even better, put 'em all up against a wall and put a bullet in their brains.  Start over.

When I most reluctantly started paying attention to the primaries this year, I felt that my beliefs were only confirmed.  They were all typical politicians, vile, scabrous, sons and daughters of syphilitic whores.  There were a couple of amusing and seemingly intelligent candidates like Kucinich (or however you spell it).  But it was all just politics.  Business as usual, nothing changes in this country.  They all suck.  Most of the Republicans were idiots obviously pandering to their rich-bitch buddies like Exxon, willing to mortgage all our futures so their wallets would get just a bit fatter.  Most of the Democrats were bleeding-heart liberals wanting to tax and spend the country into the dirt, trying to give everyone a free meal by taking food out of everyone's mouth to spread it around.

And then there was Barack Obama.  A Freshman Senator, two years in office.  Dangerously inexperienced and either a hopelessly naive starry-eyed dreamer, or a coldly calculating manipulator whose grasp was obviously <i>way</i> outside his reach.  Either way, this guy had not a Chinaman's Chance of his campaign <i>not</i> going to hell in a handbasket.  [For those curious about the origin of these phrases:  In the early nineteenth century, there was a massive influx of Chinese immigrants to the west coast, who were put to work as very cheap, very expendable day labor.  One of their jobs was being lowered over the sides of cliffs - in giant handbaskets - to set dynamite charges.  On payday, the (usually white) guys at the top of the cliff would be a bit slow to pull them up.  Oops.  We lost a couple more Chinamen.  Hey, we don't have to pay 'em now though, right?  {insert evil laugh here}]

And then it came down to Hilary and Barack.  How the hell did that happen?  I heard a lot of people saying it was simply because he was black.  Is there any truth to that?  Maybe.  Does it matter?  Nope.  What mattered is that this Freshman Senator with only two years under his belt all of a sudden had a real shot at being the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States.  Whoa.

I found this to be mildly interesting, but not really impacting on me personally.  I'm not a Democrat.  Never have been, never will be.  So whatever.  I'm not a Republican, either.  Never have been, never will be.  I have no political party.  Never will.  I think we need to do away with party politics.  I heard so many people over the past year, both on TV and on the street, bitching about partisan politics.  Hmmmmmmm.  Then maybe we should get the fuck rid of the parties?  Regardless, it was all academic for me; vaguely interesting in a distant impersonal way.

Then I started paying a bit more attention to what he was saying.  Hmm.  He has some interesting ideas.  But he's a politician.  Talking in front of a TV camera is his job.  He's just talking a good game, he's got no substance.

Then came the first Presidential debate between Obama and McCain.  Something incredibly weird happened to me.  I believed for a minute or two that this guy might actually be sincere?  Could he actually be the most rare form of life in the entirety of our limitless universe - an honest man seeking public office?  Not an honest politician - one who, once bought, stays bought - but a man who truly believed everything he was saying?

What the hell am I thinking?  He's just incredibly charming and charismatic who can convey that somehow through the TV.  I must have had some bad chili for dinner.  Thinkin' he believed the things he was saying.

Then came the Vice-Presidential debate.  Hey, this Biden guy's pretty cool.  He's well-spoken, actually answers the question he's asked - for the most part.  He speaks very directly.  Huh.  This guy's alright.  That Palin chick?  She's a freakin' moron.  What the hell was McCain thinking?  Oh, he was thinking he had to try and trump Obama being black by having a woman running-mate.  Got it.  But gods, is she <i>dumb</i>!  Biden clearly won that debate.  Good for him.  I like him.  Hey, wait!  This guy's just another politician.  What the hell am I thinking?

I missed most of the second debate because I had to work.  Then there was the third Presidential debate.

Wow, this Obama guy's really cool!  I'm actually convinced that he truly, sincerely, honestly, deeply believes in this country, its lapsed greatness - and the fact that we can be great again - and that he can honestly help us regain our greatness, and lead us into a better future.  He honestly does believe that!  So do I?  What the hell is happening to me?

I have come to believe that Barack Obama is in the germinating stage of greatness.  I have come to believe that there is something magical in him, and that he is possessed of a massive goodness, of love for his country and its people - of all colors - and I believe that he is the most sincerely good-intentioned man to be elected to the White House since Jimmy Carter.  And I have to come to believe in Barack Obama.

I never thought that I'd say that about any politician.  But for the first time in my entire life, I have hope again for the future of our country.  I have hope that we're not going to disintegrate into a thousand waring groups, waring over race, or ideology, or religion, or money.  I have hope that things will get better, and that once again I'll be able to say with a straight face that I'm proud to be an American.  And I never thought I'd have hope again about the future of our country.  In order to be honest, I have to admit that I'm still incredibly concerned, I'm still worried about our country, and we still have a long, long, long way to go.  But I have hope.

Thank you Mr. President-elect Obama.  Thank you for giving me hope in the future of my nation again.  I don't think I'll ever be able to even approach adequately expressing my gratitude to you.  But thank you.  Even if you fail to be as great as I think you will be, thank you.

I've been thinking a lot about the election this year, and the way that Barack Obama has not only fulfilled the American Dream in being elected, but re-kindled it.  And I've been thinking about how his campaign, his success-story puts me in mind of another election, an election that took place one hundred and forty years ago.  An election that took place in another time of crisis, this country's greatest crisis.  When Abraham Lincoln was elected, it was a long-shot.  Looking at his election realistically (and with a certain degree of cynicism) he didn't have any real hope of being elected.  But he was.  He made it.  In a time when America was falling apart, when hatred bred of economic rape, politically clubbing eachother over the head, and racial issues were quite literally tearing this country to pieces, Lincoln stepped up and brought this country through its most trying years and successfully out the other side.  He also served to do something else that I believe Barack Obama will do.  He crystalized all the issues afflicting the citizens of America of those long ago years.  And because Barack Obama is black, he'll crystalize our racial issues.  I think that one of the effects he'll have is to ease the distrust and fear that certain types of white people have regarding black people.  And he'll catalyze the hatred that certain white people already have into an incendiary blaze.  I only hope that those poisonous, vitriolic men and women will destroy themselves in an orgy of self-righteous ideological masturbation before they take anyone else with them.  

But mainly I wanted to say that whatever happens, I hope, and believe, that Barack Obama will lead this country through the tough times we're facing now and out the other side to the reclaim the greatness we once had, both as a nation, and as a people.  No matter our color, religion, sexual-preference, gender, financial status, or education status.  I believe that Barack Obama has the potential to be even greater than Mr. Lincoln, and I hope he fulfills that potential.

I'm still amazed that I feel this way.  And I'm still grateful.  And I've actually been tearing up while writing this.  Crying in gratitude because a <i>politician</i> instilled hope in me?  Maybe I'm not as cynical about politics as I was.  Time will tell.

But finally, and from the bottom of my heart with every fiber of my being, thank you Mr. Obama."

"event","So my computer is going nuts.  My version of Office 2000 stopped working right, and won't let me save any of my word documents.  This is obviously a problem.  So after trying to fix Office for nearly two weeks now, I decided to uninstall it altogether and try again.  Only, it can't find a ""qualifying product"" that will allow it to continue installation.  I've tried just about everything I can think of to get this damn thing to work, and it just won't.  Can anyone help?

Thanks"

"event","So I'm sitting here on Tybee beach at a bar right on the beach.  They've got psuedo-calypso music playing, and an incredibly fresh breeze is blowing in off the water.  It's stuningly beautiful.  And peaceful.  

I'm so in love with Savannah.  I have GOT to move here!  

I'm so glad that I needed to come out this way so I can fill out paperwork for Brainiac.  It dovetailed nicely with Lynn telling me how much she loves Savannah and the fact that we were going to take a road trip out here anyway.  This is simply phenomenal.  I love it here.  Going back to Atlanta, and my crappy job, is going to suck.

But for now, wow."

"event","Wow.  Got a call from Ann Crispin tonight, the author running the Writer's Workshop at Dragon*Con which, thanks to Lynn, I get to attend.  And, thanks to my parents, I'll be attending with a brand new laptop - my first!  (If, that is, FedEx can find Lynn's house.  Let's hope, shall we?)

At any rate, Ms. Crispin gave me some reading assignments to do before the Workshop.  One of the assignments was her blog <a href=""http://www.accrispin.blogspot.com"">Writer Beware</a>.  I've only read the first two dozen posts or so as of yet, but wow, I've already learned more about the publishing business than I ever thought about, and learned just how ignorant I am about said publishing business.  Thank you, Ms. Crispin.  And thanks for the wonderful phone call.

Oh, and while we were talking, she asked if I'd submitted a manuscript.  I told her yes, and told her the title, whereupon she completely blew my mind and gave me a brief description of it.  True, she read it earlier today (actually, yesterday - Sunday) but still, she's got 25 manuscripts to read before this Thursday; I'm thrilled she remembered it at all.  

Well, <i>I</i> think it's pretty cool."

"event","So Lynn found something interesting happening at Dragon Con that she thought I'd want to join.  Boy, was she right.  It's a Writer's Workshop being run by Anne C. Crispin.  For those of you who don't read sci-fi/fantasy extensively, she's a writer in that genre, and a really good one.  So - again thanks to Lynn - I'm getting to attend the workshop, and she's reviewing the first 5000 words of my manuscript.  How cool is that?

Back around the first of August I sent a very old friend of mine an e-mail to see what he was up to, how he was doing, that sort of thing.  Well, he was doing pretty dandy.  He'd gotten hired by a company called Brainiac Studios.  My buddy Gil is an amazing artist and he's working as their concept artist on some games they're producing.  He told me I should contact their head writer, as they apparently had quite a bit of stuff they needed written, and really needed some help.  So I did, and it turns out Suzie loves my work, and really wants to hire me.

Had a meeting with her and Ray and I'm now an intern for Brainiac Studios.  And, unless something goes drastically wrong, which I don't forsee happening, then in mid-October, I'll get hired by them, and be a profession writer.  I'm so incredibly jazzed!

And to top it off, Lynn is the absolute best girlfriend in the whole world!  Life is pretty good, and getting better.  Yay!

I love you, Lynn."

"event","So, two events in two weekends.  I'm <i>severely</i> out of practice.  heh  I'm tired and sore, but pretty satisfied.  I had a lot more fun playing a mute character than I thought I would.  It helped that more people than I would have imagined were able to translate my clumsy attempts at charades.  Johnathan (the guy playing Squire Felix) was simply amazing.  He is now my unofficial translator.  And Lynn, of course, got most of what I was ""saying,"" too.  Yay.

For Lynn's birthday, I wanted to shower her with gifts, but due to the fact that I'm poor, wasn't able to do nearly as much as I wanted.  But she seems pretty pleased overall, so I'm happy.  I love you, baby.

And now for something completely related to what I've been talking about.

"event","Why is it that lately the only time I get inspired to write is when I'm exhausted?  It's really pretty annoying.  I mean, I have Sundays and Mondays off every week.  Two whole days I could spend writing.  But do I get inspired to write?  Do I have a great wellspring of words flowing forth, and a burning desire to set them down before they flutter away like dandelions on the wind?  Fuck no.  Of course not.

I get inspired after I've had three or four hours of sleep a night for several nights in a row, then I've just worked a very long double.  My feet are throbbing, my head is pounding, my eyes are struggling to stay open, and I'm not firing on all my cylinders - like I ever am, right?  <i>That's</i> when I feel the need to write.  A compulsion almost.

Were it possible, I'd be tempted to throttle my Muse and tell her to stop fucking with me like this.  Make her inspire me when I've had a relatively decent amount of sleep.  

I guess I could always just try and <i>make</i> myself write.  Couldn't hurt, I suppose.

I'm behind on my lj test taking so here you are.  First is the one that went around ages ago about which Serenity Character are you?  I got Mal as my top option.  Thought the rest of the results were kind of funny, too.  So:

Capt. Mal Reynolds
 75% 

The Operative
 69% 

Zoe Alleyne Washburne
 69% 

Kaylee Frye
 63% 

Simon Tam
 63% 

River Tam
 63% 

Inara Serra
 44% 

Shepherd Derrial Book
 44% 

Hoban 'Wash' Washburne
 31% 

Jayne Cobb

 25% 

And next:  self explanatory.

Almost as soon as he sat down, he had to jump up again.  The other managers present were all in a meeting, so Mike had to conduct two interviews, take care of the armored car guy picking up money, jump onto the line to cook because we got a bit busy, and handle a couple of guest issues.  So he had Brandy, the bartender on duty, tag out with him.  So she got to eat his appetizer, and his dessert. hehe  Poor Mike.

But finally, we finished up and I'm all good to go.  Yay!

"event","After a two and a half year hiatus from LARPing, I was invited to NPC/monster an ETN event.  Being unemployed, still, I decided that it might be fun, so I went.

Before the event actually started, I knew that by Sunday, I'd be hurting pretty badly.  I'm way out of practice at LARPing.  I was right.  Hell, when I got up on Saturday, I was hurting.  Of course, it didn't help that on Friday night I got racked three times on one module.  Not fun, let me tell you.

Anyways, the event proceeded, I had great fun, and some good roleplaying, and some wonderful reminiscences.  A great weekend overall.  And the weekend rekindled my enjoyment of LARPing.  So much so, that I've got the PC bug again.  I honestly don't think I could ever just PC or NPC.  I've got to do both.  heh

For now, I just hope that I can get my characters transferred to ETN in a reasonable amount of time.

Lanky, thanks a bunch for talking me into going.  Verbal, thank you greatly for getting me there and back again.  MistressZ, as always, you rock.  And thank you everybody else for such a fabulous weekend."

Now normally I'd just skip working out, too.  But I was sitting here after I got the word, and decided to hell with it.  

So I hiked my butt down to the weight room and pumped some iron.  Not a whole lot, mind you, as I'm still working on getting into shape and have many years of couch-potato slackness to overcome.  But, I did it anyways, depsite my absolute loathing and hatred of working out by myself.  I'm proud of myself.  Now I'm going to just sit here, my arms big tubes of jello, until I can muster the energy for a shower.

After that, it's another boring evening of doing fuck-all for me.  Such is the life of an unemployed geek.  I don't know if Digi_Av is ""working"" tonight or not.  If he is, and anyone's going to visit, I'd love to go with if you wouldn't mind picking me up.

"event","So I've spent much of the last two days downloading and watching almost all the fan films available on <a href=""http://theforce.net"">TFN</a>.  After watching <i>everything</i> I downloaded, I simply have to voice my opinion of the vast majority of the writers of these things...

<lj-cut text=""To see what I think of these folks, click here..."">

<font size=""15""><font color=""red"">

FUCKTARDS!
</font></font>

Sweet Chocolate Jesus H. Christ on fucking roller-skates!

Doesn't Yoda say, quite clearly, in Episode One regarding the Sith that only ""Two there are, a Master and an Apprentice?""  You'd <i>think</i> that if someone is a big enough geek to want to make a Fan Film in the Star Wars Universe that they'd pay enough fucking attention to something like that, wouldn't you?  And yet, in most of these freakin' things, the heroes have to fight a Sith.  Not a Dark Jedi, but a Sith.  And not Vader, either!  Okay, some of them are set during the Episode I to II period, but still.  Sheesh.  In one of these movies the heroes are attacked by a <i>pair</i> of Sith.  And both of them are apprentices to, you guessed it....Darth Sidious.  Sheesh.

Yes, I know, I'm taking this a bit seriously.  But hey, I'm a Star Wars Super-Freak, ok?  I'll be the first to admit it.  I like precision and accuracy, especially when it comes to Star Wars.  And these guys are totally fucking up.  

I mean, they spend a shit-ton of money on sets, effects, costuming, and props, and then totally screw the pooch on something as simple as how many Sith there are.  Make your bad guys Dark Jedi.  <i>That</i> I could swallow.  But don't you think the Jedi would have noticed if there were two or three dozen Sith running around attacking Jedi every ten minutes or so?  

Aside from that, many of the writers just completely mangle characters from the movies and books.  For instance, Amidala.  In one particular short film - I don't remember which one as most have run together in my head - Amidala, who is now a Jedi Knight (What the <i>FUCK?</i>) is running away from Vader with young Luke and Leia.  Puh-leeeeeeze.  In another - a five part movie no less - the ""plot"" (if you can call it that) asserts that Mara Jade was a fully trained Jedi.  And that it was she who got the Death Star Plans to the Rebellion.  Ummm, what?  Oh yeah, and Boba Fett helped the rebels get the plans out.  Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.

Yeah, yeah, I know that most of these were probably produced before Episode II hit the theatres, but <i>still</i>!  

Humorously enough, the best of these films as far as story goes, were the ones obviously made by Star Wars Geeks with real jobs...not folks who already work in the television or movie industry.  One of the better stories was obviously shot in a hotel conference room, although the guys who made it put shots of the Coruscant skyline in the hotel window, complete with lots of traffic moving between the buildings.  

Some of the films were obviously parodies, and were hysterical.  Like ""The Empire Strikes Backyard,"" and ""House Wars.""  I think ""House Wars"" is my favorite.  If you're looking for a really great laugh, <a href=""http://www.theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/housewars/index.shtml"">check it out.</a>

The other thing that really annoyed me about these films is that in nearly every one of these that a lightsaber duel breaks out, at least one of the involved characters whips out a Darth Maul style lightsaber.  It's cool that Darth Maul had one.  And then everybody has to go and copy it.  Damn, but it's annoying.

At any rate, I just had to vituperate a little on some of these really crappy fan films.  Some of them, however, are really damned good, or at least funny.  And there's one on the site that isn't Star Wars at all, but definitely worth a watch.  Check out <a href=""http://theforce.net/theater/nonsw/grayson/index.shtml"">Grayson</a>.  It rocks.  And if you loved the movie Princess Bride, you should check out <a href=""http://theforce.net/theater/shortfilms/brains/"">Brains and Steel</a>.

Anyways, I'm out."

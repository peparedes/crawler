"event","After screening literally hundreds of hosting solutions, I finally settled on a reliable company that offered dedicated servers at a not unreasonable price. So if all goes well most of my websites will be back online within 72 hours. I hope this works out, I'm tired of 18 hour days with no pay, it seems like I only live to sit in front of a computer."

"event","Well...First of maybe I should explain that I am a professional Internet Content Provider (ICP) and Internet Programmer and WebHost (ISP). Due to a recent illness which kept me down for quite awhile my upstream service provider decided to go out of business and left me high and dry, and with no legal recourse as he refunded the remainder of the contract fee I had already paid.

So after getting out of the hospital after loosing a kidney I am immediatly confronted with (no shit) over 600+ emails and registered letters from lawyers and other assorted legal lowlife threatening everything from lawsuits, voodoo curses and carbombings. So after a week and half of tracking down my previous customers (over 400) and paying them refunds and apologies, I find I have to start all over again. This time with a tainted reputaion and *muchly* diminished resources.

Thru all this I have one saving grace, an extremely talented artist who is willing to help me out stricly out of the goodness of her heart...you know who you are girl so I won't embarrass you by mentioning your name here. But your the cat's meow luv!

Well lets just say so far this year has really sucked, but I may be down...but I ain't out! If a Pheonix can rise out of his own ashes then I'm damn sure going to try!

Thank you my Graphics Princess, you give me more strength than you'll ever know. And for anyone who reads this..I have never even met this woman, only online.

I should be back online within a week...and I'll end this with just this....KENSHI RULES!!!!"

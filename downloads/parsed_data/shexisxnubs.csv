wow that was so much fun. me and paul were the first ones there, cuz thats how freaking awesome we are. hah. and soon came TONS of other people. it was kinda raining at first but that was okay. for awhile we were hanging out on the porch. me and paul kept annoying danielle by saying ""OH OH....IS THAT JUSTIN???"" hah it was fun. but then like tons of preps came in. well like 7 ha. so that was kinda stupid. anyway...justin came and we attacked him and all feel down. haha. fun.
the first band to play was Monty. they were super good. i really liked them. then next was kudara. they were a heavy metal band. Danielle, Paul, Justin and i all made fun of the hardcoreness. ahha. we were head banging and stuff. it was pretty freaking cool. haha. the third bad was METAL PIZZA. haha they made paul were a robot suit. it was hilarious. it was silver and orange. and by the end of the set it was all distroyed. this was when sharon came in. oh yes. we watched paul kill the robot suit. i think i might have moshed a little. hah. but in the begining during monty. Paul, Justin, some other kid and I grabbed water noodles and moshed with them. that was so much fun. we sat outside, paul mooned me, poored water all over himself. haha. so anyway, it started raining during the METAL PIZZA set so me and sharon kept each other warm. haah. we were dancing and stuff.next band came on and we went to the basement. we were all moshing and stuff. Allison sure throws some hard punches...wow. haha she punched me in the throat. and also somebody kicked me in the back. and me knee really hurts. erg. i fell on this one guy though while moshing. ahah. the band Fenn was really good and so was silence of the wake. a lot of people left after fenn. *sniff*. but it was cool. me sharon and alexa danced a ton. hahaha. we are so cool. then we bought some pizza. i had 3 pieces. geez i was so hungry. i had a ton of fun. YES. and some new bruises. haah. they hurt but its okay. :). 

well tomorrow is pauls and I's four month anaversairy :). we are going to the mall instead of walking around brighton. but thats good. :). i love paul :).

i cleaned it up good.
then i called paul and asked if he could come over and luckily...HE COULD. yay. so we decided that we were going to go to allis.
so...WE WENT. alli has a super nice house i love it. and a nice bed. i wish i had it :). unfortunatly since not only was me and paul there...without the parent home, joel was too. so we got kicked out :/. but thats alright. joel took us to johns house. and we hung out and talked awhile before we had to leave.
we left..and went back to my house. and since my parents werent home they locked the doors. gosh. and that sucked cuz we were just going to go back to pauls after getting my ps2 and simpson dvds. but we couldnt since the house was locked
so joel took us to pauls.
i had so much fun at his house. we ate sloppy joes (well just me) and he ate eggs and toast.
we went back to his room watched tv.
kissed
hugged
and family guy
that last one screams love. hah
then before his mom took me home we went to Krogger to pick up a few things. i stole some bobby pins i really needed some. and paul too some hair bands with beads on them. haah. i have one :). its orange. i sure do love paul
so much
makes me cry to think of life without him.

...im glad i dont have to walk down that dark hall.


tomorrow me and paul want to hang out with joel and alli. so ill probably call them and see if joel can pick us up. or something. i dunno.

oh just a 6 month warning - Hooters on my birthday. my mom already said yes. so....PREPARE!

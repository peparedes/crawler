"event","I see a girl
I see the marks on her arms
The marks she tries so desperatly to hide

I see the sadness in her heart
And the pain-filled tears as they run down her cheek

I see the bruises that are no longer there
The scars that have faded with time

I see the emotions she covers up with a smile
That smile
Her mask

I see past it all
I see the girl she tries to hide

The girl with broken dreams
Bad memories
Hate
Fear
Guilt
Depression

I see her eyes pleading silently for help
I see all of this and more
The girl I see...

...Is my reflection looking back at me...

AWSOME, AWSOME, AWSOME poem love it soo much!!!!! it resembles me somehow i think what do you guys think? love ya."

"event","Okay first off i would like to say that because of heather saying that she didnt like my new icon i changed it back because i do kinda think that this one is better......... i had the greatest time with heather yesterday, we went to this thing in willi, street fest, and met up with a shit load of her friends and then we went to this guy chris's house and he was really hott, and they had kittens there so heather couldn't resist taking one home and so when we got into the car with the kitten we had to keep making meowing noises and i thought it was hilerious and before i went with heather i got so stonned with my EX it wasn't even funny, all i remember while i was stoned was ""your tub is goo"" which was what i said and then me and my EX making out for like 10 minutes, well it was awsome but i kinda wish that he wasn't stonned while we were making out because he doesn't even remember us doing that, oo well but it was fun while it lasted, i cant wait for another street fest to roll around. well gotta go peoples tty l8ter.

"event","God i hate it when people talk shit about you and they cant even do anything about it, this kid named mikey roca was being a fucking dick head and he fought a little bit with this kid named brandon and he was saying all of this shit to brandon and then after they fought he goes "" go ahead tell me i'm a little bitch to my face"" and then i called him a bitch insted of brandon and he didn't say shit.......... and another thing that pissed me off is that casaundra and these other people were saying ""oh this class is gay"" or ""oh this game is really gay and your being gay"" i was trying to tell them not to say that because its not fucking right but no i am the one to get bitched at because i was trying to do the right thing, when i told casaundra to stop she just kept on saying it and saying it because she thought it might be funny if i get pissed off and she also does it because she knows that i cant do anything about it so i was mad at her for almost the rest of the day............ and then we were watching this movie for 2 hours today because some of the people on my team went on a field trip, it was the movie ""Where The Red Fern Grows"" and in the end this one dog dies and it was because a moutain lion slices one of the dogs chests open and then the other dog wouldn't eat because it didn't have it's ""brother"" around so then it crawled all the way over to it's brother's grave and the boy who owned the dog held it in his arms until it died and then i was trying to hold back all of my tears but they just came right out and people were making fun of me because i was crying to such a ""gay"" movie as they would like to put it but i didn't think that it was gay i thought it was a very sad movie and if it could make me cry it was good. well gotta go but i'll tty l8ter..........

SEX IS A TEMPTATION
CAUSED BY A SENSATION
WHEN A MAN PUTS HIS DICTATION
IN A WOMAN'S VENTILATION
DO YOU GET MY CONVERSATION?
OR DO YOU NEED A DEMONSTRATION?

SKY IS BLUE
WATER IS WET
I'LL MAKE YOU CUM
I'LL MAKE YOU SWEAT
PRESSED AGAINST MY BODY
MOVIN UP AND DOWN
SLOWLY BUT FIRMLY
WE WILL MOVE THE GROUND

SEX IS EVIL
SEX IS A GAME
ONE NIGHT OF PASSION
NINE MONTHS OF PAIN
BABY'S A BASTARD
FATHERS A GIT
ALL BECAUSE THE CONDOM SPLIT!

SEX IS LIKE MATH
YOU SUBTRACT THE CLOTHES
ADD THE BED
DIVIDE THE LEGS
THEN MULTIPLY!

ROSES ARE RED
GRASS IS GREEN
OPEN YOUR LEGS
AND I'LL FILL YOU WITH CREAM

HICKERY DICKERY DOC
DIS BYTCH WAS SUCKIN MY COCK
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWO
I DUMPED MY GOO
AND DUMPED HER AT DA END OF THE BLOCK!!!

SEX IS GOOD
SEX IS FINE
DOGGY STYLE OR 69
JUST FOR FUN
OR GETTING PAID
EVERYONE LIKES GETTING LAID

SEX IS EVIL
SEX IS A SIN
SINS ARE FORGIVEN
SO STICK IT IN!!!

FUCKING AWSOME!!!!"

"event","Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you

Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud
And no one hears you screaming

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me...

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?

Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside your bleeding

No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me...

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

No one ever lied straight to your face
No one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy
But I'm not gonna be ok
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work
It was always there
You don't know what it's like
What it's like

To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like

Welcome to my life
Welcome to my life

My love silently awaits to bloom 
Waits to see what the new day will bring 
Waiting for the birds to sing 
Staring into the stars and beyond 
Anticipating the dawn 
And with my own eyes 
I'll watch the sunrise 
Then from the shade 
I'll watch as the days fade 
In the twilight my heart will cry 
But as the day ends my love will die 
And once again I'll be alone and cold 
Alone I'll live, Alone I'll die with no one to hold
My love is like a dying rose 
But from death it somehow arose 
Stronger than before 
I couldn't possibly love more 
Though once again my love walks out the door 
My love returns to me like the tide to the shore 
And though under the weeping willow i weep
My love for now is mine to keep 
Until someone steals it and tosses it aside 
Come out my love my sunshine don't you hide 
Watch with me the sunset then the sunrise 
Oh how i love hellos and hate good-byes 
But after all hello and good-bye is all there is to love 
And all the rest well we have to dream of"

"event","Today fucking sucked! casaundra got susspened for something she didn't even do! my ex-friend corey called her a slut even tho he was denying it and she fucking threw her bag down and started fucking screaming at him but he told her that he was saying it to me, and he didn't get susspened because the teachers said that he didn't even do anything, god i fucking hate this school it sucks fucking ass! the school told corey that he would be exspelled if he didn't start dressing like everyone else because he was and still is ""goth""but he stands out from everyone else and they also said that it was a ""distraction""to everyone because everyone was making a huge deal out of it, and that teacher today that told casaundra to go to the office, i was ready to fucking knock her out i was so pissed off, she was like "" go to the office"" and she was practically fondaling casaundra god all of the fucking teachers can go fucking die! i hate them all! lets see what have they said about me..... oo yeah my math teacher called me stupid because i didn't get any of the shit that he was talking about and my science teacher talks alot of shit about people for no reason and she called casaundra a bitch behind her back prolly me i just haven't found out yet, my LA and reading teacher yells at me constantly for no reason and the only real nice ones that haven't said anything about me is a teacher that i am learning shakespear with (she says that i have the potental to be an actress on day) and my S.S teacher who is funny as hell and really nice to me, not to mention my school is homophobic because there is this gay guy in my school named josh and he is such a fucking sweet heart and all of the teachers are always giving him dirty looks for no reason which i dont think that anyone notices but i do, and i got my report card today to and i thought that i did good because i have been making a effort to turn in my assignments but no i got all bad grades except for a C- in S.S, how in the hell does someone fail P.E? i donno i can't wait until i move again, the only bad thing about moving again is that i will have to leave all of my friends and start over again and i would miss casaundra WAY to much, i might be moving to hebron, i lived there when i was 2 but i dont really remember it. i was gunna call heather last night but i didn't because i'm not really sure if we are friends now or if she just wanted me to be able to tell her stuff and give me advice and thats it but i donno. how do you tell your boyfriend that his penis is too small? haha just kidding! someone asked that in sex-ed today because the teacher told the class to ask him one question that you wanted to kno about sex and this girl said that but i thought it was pretty funny even tho i'm not in sex-ed i already had it and it was fun, got to go on the computer the whole 45 minutes of it and the teacher didn't even notice that was the only awsome class i have had all fucking year! well gotta go but i'll ttyl

"event","Wow, i'm suprized heather actually said something nice about my poetry, but i kno that she iz still mad at me tho, she'll prolly never be my friend again because i am a pouser (sigh) i guess that i just miss that from her, she always used to give me advice and stuff lyke that and i wish i still had her to confide in i am soo fucking stupid for ever stealing from her because in the back of my mind i knew that if i ever got caught by her then she would do all of this, god why am i such a fucking dumbass? i wonder if she got my letter yet hmmmm..... and another thing iz i dont wanna fight nemore YOU GUYZ WIN!!!!! i'm done feeling this way, having everyone say that i am a piece of shit and actually agreeing to it doesn't make me feel that great but idk i cant apologize to any of them like heather because i kno that she wont take my apology and then i will feel even worse about myself than i already do but i'm not sure, if heather says she wantz an apology then i will give her one until then idk."

"event","A sensation like no other
It's louder then thunder
A cut in the night
As she held the knife
Clenching her fists
Only wanting to be kissed
Feeling alone
Hold her in the cold
Wanting to be loved
But only to give and not to recieve
She thought he was sent
With all his charm
To take away harm
Realizing
Her love went to waste
And once again she gets a taste
Of her more than often heartbreak"

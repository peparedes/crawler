It was a good year. 

There were new friends made

New things learnt. 

New realisation of old things. 

And going into only the second month of 2015 has seen us receive many reminders of who we are and what we are called to do.

Lead us, Guide us. We will try and make ourselves available. We will try and fit into the huge puzzle that only You can make.

"event","<p dir=""ltr"">Just attended IDMC 2014. It was a truly blessed time and I truly gained a lot from it. 

Chiefly, a renewed sense of urgency and a need to actualise the things that I've always had simmering at the back of my head. 

Schedulise to actualise. 

So I guess I must make it a point to really put it inside my calendar so that I may allocate time to it. Time which, if not rationed properly, would be squandered away by the many inane activities that I do.

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">And so another clash begins for the hearts and minds of the Sheeple.

What separates bigotry from making a stand?

What separates asserting rights and imposing of ideology?

When do freedoms become restrictions?

And when does silence no longer suffice for tolerance?

What is society other than an organised collection of minorities
with similarities comprising thus the majority?

"event","<div style=""text-align: center;"">I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
And on the pedestal these words appear:
&quot;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

Perhaps with more time I would be able to ramble on more, and hopefully keep the journal entries as a log and memoir. 

A silent shout in cyberspace, public and yet lost in the sea of voices. 

yea...a new beginning"

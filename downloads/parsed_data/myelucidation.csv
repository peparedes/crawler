And maybe, just maybe my command of the English has deproved so dramatically I'm ashamed of my own writing. Hahah. Tonight, I have for you some pictures that are too (gasp) &quot;bad&quot; for facebook. Because I broke some rules and the teachers (who so happen to BE on facebook) cannot hear about this. Lol. Seriously, I had fun, and at this point, I'm not sure the teachers would say anything about it. (: But, I'll take the advice from some awesome friends, and keep these off facebook! (:<br /><div style=""text-align: center""><div style=""text-align: left"">&nbsp;</div><div style=""text-align: center""><div style=""text-align: center""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ae8bx/s320x240"" /></div><div style=""text-align: left"">So, this is me, going up and down that one straight road behind the collage, trying to get the hang of this heavy piece of metal that I first believed to have a mind of its own.</div><div style=""text-align: center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ak590/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000af7t5/s320x240"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: left"">Then, Peter's teacher Ha, gets news that Peter (and Juian) are at Brown Cafe, just down the road from where we were. And we decide to take two scooters to go pick them up. My teacher, Tam, is on Ha's scooter because she doesn't trust me and my unsafe/unstable/inexperienced riding. On the way to Brown Cafe, we meet Vanessa, who is very excited being a pillion rider on (another) Ha's scooter. She was talking alot and pointing out at stuff, until she sees me riding on my own. When she does, she screams &quot;ARE YOU SERIOUS?!&quot; as we pass each other.</div><div style=""text-align: center""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ag061/s320x240"" /></div><div style=""text-align: left"">Because my riding is &quot;unsafe/unstable/inexperienced&quot; Miss Tam ushers Juian onto Ha's scooter, and signals for Peter to sit behind me.</div><div style=""text-align: center""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ahq6f/s320x240"" /></div><div style=""text-align: left"">Peter is an idiot and thinks I've had experience riding one of these (he's partially right because I tried to learn in 2005 but almost got into an accident and didn't try again after that). He soon discovers he's wrong, when I move off and the scooter starts wobbling dangerously because of Peter's weight. Peter then grips my shoulders so hard they start to bruise, and holds on until we get back (even after I stabalized the scooter)!</div><div style=""text-align: center""><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ak590/""><img height=""240"" alt="""" width=""320"" border=""0"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/myelucidation/pic/000ak590/s320x240"" /></a></div><div style=""text-align: left"">This, is my favourite part of the story to tell. (: Peter now wants to attempt to ride on his own too, and so we get the keys, start the scooter up, and Ha talks him through accelerating and braking. Peter turns the accelerator every so slightly, and the scooter lurched forward. He quickly lets go and waves his hands frantically, repeatedly saying &quot;no&quot;, and gives up trying. We then pose for this picture and then he gets off.</div><br /><span style=""font-size: small""><span><strong>The end. (:</strong></span><br /></span><span style=""font-size: small"">&nbsp;</span></div></div><br />P.S. Peter claims he almost died that afternoon.<br />P.P.S Unlocked for the viewing pleasure of those not on LJ. (:<br />P.P.P.S LJ cut is not working for me, so sorry to screw up your friend pages!/:"

"event","<strong>NUMBER 360 BENJAMIN HUANG. 56hrs 39mins!(:</strong> <br />You did an awesome job. You hung in there as well as you could and really pushed yourself to the limit. You saw your friends and family and other important people showing up to give you the support! Cheering, screaming, making posters, etc. Well, I'm proud of you for hanging in there for such a long time! <br /><br />You probably would love to hear that you started to lose awareness. You sometimes had no idea why your hand was on the car. You lost control of your right hand. AND you stayed at the car when it was time for your break. You did great listening to our instructions, and collapsed once you were disqualified. None of us would have performed as well as you did. So, well done, my friend.

He's had his hand on car no. 10 for 28 hours and 50 mins and we're all proud of him. He was under the sun, there was a huge thunderstorm last night and showers again this early afternoon. He's sleepy, his right&nbsp; hand and arm hurts, his back hurts, his legs hurt, and his determination has dithered to an almost-nothing.

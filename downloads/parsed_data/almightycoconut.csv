"event","Today I got laryngitis. I lost my voice and i talk really funny. Jim, Danny, and Kyle were laughing @ me and how i laugh now. :( 

But anyway.. I went to Jims house to get him because we were going to the mall with Danny and Kyle. But Danny is alittle slow and gave me really bad directions. Then after like 20 minutes.. Jim called Kyle and he drove to Farley to meet me. Then we went back to Kyle's house to drop off his car. We were driving down 9W and there was a guy pushing his car into the middle of the street and the light turned green so I beeped @ him and Kyle yelled at him. It was really funny, THat guy was a dumbass. Then we finally got to the mall and we were there for like half an hour but it was boring so we left. We went to brians house and Danielle, Amanda, little Brian, Rob, Ant, Josh, & Nick were there. Amanda is sick too, which really sucks. I hate being sick. Then some people left cause they got bored, & i had to come home cause of the stupid 9:00 law. But now i can rest and hopefully feel better by the end of this weekend.   

oh yeah.. Feel better Amanda :)"

You're strong and have the reflexes<br>of a tiger.  You're overly protective, and<br>those skills come in handy...  You're a natural<br>person, with a taste for natural foods (I mean<br>organic, here.).  Well, that's not true.<br>...Just food in general!  You're as<br>quick-witted as your reflexes, and sometimes<br>painfully logical.  You love wild animals and<br>pets.  (Preferably wild animals!)  You're a<br>natural person, and a true child of Gaia.<br>You're a stimulating, and outgoing person.  You<br>enjoy making people think, especially with your<br>infectiously spontaneous attitude.  You're a<br>generally optomistic person, with a love for<br>showing off all of your good traits.  Although<br>many people may see you as strung-out, or just<br>plain weird, you're very down-to-earth and<br>humble.  You're incredibly sweet (as this<br>color's other name!), and you care about people<br>in general.  As this color would describe,<br>you're energetic beyond all human<br>comprehension.  You've got a nack for drawing,<br>and you enjoy it, too.  When it comes to<br>school, you're a good listener with an even<br>better memory.  You're studious...  At least<br>when you need to be!

"event","Just got home from Nyack. Me, Jim, Kyle, and Mccormick took the bus to the mall at 5:30 and didn't get there untill about 6:20. We walked to like 3 different stores trying to figure out what we're going to do with the long night ahead of us.. Mccormick said he could get us into a movie but ofcoarse he didn't ..so we decided to walk around more and ponder. We saw Henry with some people so we picked up henry and then went to fye. Jim got a CD and some other little things. Then danny ate chinese food that looked really bad. Then we took a bus to Nyack. We saw Brian and Danielle and went to The Back Door and some really gay band was playing and gave me a headache. We saw Brian K. too and he came also. Then some solo guy came on and read a poem and almost started crying. Then he sang a song that was better then any of those gay bands. He was very very lonely and needed some friends.. i felt really bad for him. Then STF played and thats it. Then we left that gay place and were walking up main street when i saw danielle, melissa, amanda and some other people. Then i left them and then 5 minutes later i saw them again... and then again.. and then they left. So we were all standing outside of planet wings and Brian's mom comes to get us so we all get in the car and there is 8 kids in the car. it was crazy b/c there was cops everywhere. Then i got home and Brian K. came in to say hi to my brother but he was sleeping so Brian went home(he ran home cause the aliens were coming)so yeah that was my day.."

"event","Ok first Becca came to pick me up and as soon as i got in the car she was like wendy's! and i was like deffinitly!cause we were starving.. then we get to wendy's and there are like 9 cars in the drive through.. so we decided to go inside. We ordered our food and were waiting for 15 minutes for 1 order of goddamn fries because they were cooking!, but we got food for Dara too to surprise her. Then we get to Dara's house and she came outside and we surprised her with all the good food and she was like OH MAN! lol so we went inside and ate our yummy food and then burned some CD's for Becca and we saw Dara's cool rabbit named buttons(so cute) lol. then it shed all over us so we put buttons down. Me and Becca then left because Dara was going driving with her mom. Then me and becca went and picked up some kid Danny that lives near Dara and then me, Becca, and Danny rented Monty Python and the Holy Grail lol it was soo funny. Then we stopped it alittle more than half way through cause it was too long. so yeah.. Becca and me were going to drop Danny off and we see some little kids with a lemonade stand for a big cup of lemonade for 50 cents so we had to stop and get some lol it was really really good. It was PINK lemonade.. not the regular kind... so it was EXTREMELY good. Then we dropped Danny off and then we were going back to my house.. but we passed Brian cause he was skating near my house with Mike.. so we stopped and talked to them alittle while and then Melissa and Rob show up so then me and Becca are supposed to go back to my house for spaghetti and meatballs so i invited Brian to come eat dinner cause my parents like him lol.. so we ate dinner then went to Becca's house and me Becca and Brian went to the park on the river and were playing on the swings and see-saws. So then my dad comes and picks me and Brian up from Becca's and drops Brian off at home. Then i was sitting at home reading a couple chapters of my book and i hear these voices outside my house.. so i'm like wtf? whose here? and its Alex and his friend Shaun.. i didn't even know he knew where i lived? They said they got lost alot.. lol so we were going to go bowling cause Alex has never been bowling before.. but the bowling alley was closed so we went to dunkin doughnuts instead.. we didn't get anything.. so we walked around by alex's house and then they dropped me off home cause they had to go get some kid Tom home.. so yeah that was pretty much my really long day."

"event","This is a complicated issue for me. On the one hand I believe with every fiber of my being that those who commit violence against another person (usually women) should face stiff penalties (locked up and let the government figure out what to do with them). However, using the term &quot;sexually dangerous&quot; is way too ambiguous. 

The current popularization of the word &quot;queer&quot; is a reclaiming of a slur attached to people deemed perverted and dangerous to society - homosexuals, dykes, faggots, queens, hermaphrodites, transvestites. Fifty years ago &quot;queer&quot; marked a person &quot;sexually dangerous.&quot; 

Why did the justices choose the word &quot;dangerous&quot;? Especially considering &quot;danger&quot; is a sexualized and vilified identity - the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks; the bad girl who'll fuck you, dump you, then make you beg for more. Why not &quot;sexually violent&quot;? 

There's something not right about their choice of language. Something not right at all."

"event","My back pain was caused by a kidney infection. A fucking kidney infection. Good goddess almighty! 

After 2 weeks of cry-my-eyes-out pain I finally got some relief today. I was starting to panic, starting to think my MS was flaring up. I went to an urgent care last Sunday and they gave me muscle relaxants and a narco pain med, neither of which provided any relief. I was in a fucking haze AND in pain. This week I put a call in to my neuro just in case, and made an appt at the campus clinic. 

The urgent care place didn't even check for a kidney infection, but the clinic did. Turns out I got some stuff floating around in my pee that indicated an infection. The PA that saw me was awesome. I really want her to be a dyke. She was chubby and matter of fact, and had facial hair and orthopedic shoes. I took to her right away. She hooked me up with antibiotics (and some diflucan), more muscle relaxants to take before bed, prescription ibuprofen, and an order for physical therapy. She was like, &quot;WHY did they give you ultram? That doesn't make any sense. WHY didn't they test for a kidney infection?&quot; And I was all &quot;I&nbsp;dunno...&quot; 

My back is ALREADY feeling better after 1 freakin' ibuprofen horse pill. ONE! What a fucking ordeal. I can't believe I wrote a final paper feeling like this."

I was hoping the back tension would just magically disappear. It hasn't. Which has brought me here to complain about it and reflect on how fucking hard this semester has been. <br /><br />This has been one of the lightest workloads I've had since I started in Fall 2008, minus a few crunching deadlines. But what a fucking emotional hellhole. If I wasn't crying I was having anxiety attacks or oversleeping or procrastinating or just really mad. But I keep a pretty calm exterior, which I'm coming to learn is a gift. <br /><br />What's next...I got a summer job in <a href=""http://writing.msu.edu"">The Writing Center</a> at MSU, which I'm actually extremely nervous about.

I have about 3 weeks left in the semester and my 2nd year of this master's degree will be over. For some reason this has been a really difficult semester - emotionally and mentally. I've been doing some really hard work on myself, and it shows itself through depression, lack of focus and motivation, headaches, and apparently anxiety attacks. But I feel good about the life work I'm doing. 

Speaking of work, I have a channel on Vimeo.com of my work on <a href=""www.vimeo.com/channels/thegenderproject"">The Gender Project</a>, which is a series of short documentaries about the lived experience of gender. This project is ongoing and will hopefully keep growing in the next few years. I've been presenting it at conferences and am in the very beginning of a major marketing push to get the project in people's minds, classrooms, and workshops. My next stop is the <a href=""http://www.digitalparlor.org/cw2010/"">Computers & Writing conference</a> at the end of May. I'll be displaying The Gender Project as an installation that will be up throughout the conference."

I'm waiting for FedEx to deliver my medication. It comes packed in an inflatable cooler and ice packs because it has to stay refrigerated. So, I have to be home when they deliver it. It's the rules. 

I like Thursday mornings cause I get to sleep in, which just means I don't get up at 6:30/7 to take K to campus. She doesn't teach on Thursday mornings. I've always wondered when the transition from staying up late to getting up early would take place. Here it is. I am not a morning person, tho I've been getting myself up by myself since the 3rd grade (when I got my first alarm clock). If I could communicate with grunts and head nods in the morning I would. 

Ani Radio on Pandora is playing ""Fast or Faster"" by Bree Sharp. I love this song, and only know about it cause of Pandora, which is a fuckin' sweet web app.

"event","Some of this story can only be told in pictures, and some only in words. My first semester of grad school ended with a shot out of a cannon. I spent the first week of winter break floating, unaccustomed to having nothing to do. 

I cooked...

chicken & dumplings

...and decorated for the holiday.

And then ""having nothing to do"" turned into ""there isn't enough time in the day."" I decided to hand-make most of the holiday gifts I was giving this year. I painted stencils, made magnets, and made baked goods.

By this time Katie was coming out of the post- first-semester float too.

This was our first holiday season we've been able to spend together. First stop, Trenton for christmas eve and morning. 

<img src=""http://lh4.ggpht.com/_QBLtraYVqGw/SVwLjiKB9GI/AAAAAAAAFzo/3B9EfNMtAV4/s288/DSC03675.JPG"" />

I was so grateful to be invited and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent with Katie's family. They are all so warm. And Katie's mom was eager to get me ""hammered"" and fill my belly.

Second stop, Farmington Hills for Christmas with my family. 

the stocking I've had since birth:

We hit the road Friday morning for Arkansas. What should've been an 11 hour trip turned into 16 hours because we drove through an ice storm. 

<img src=""http://lh3.ggpht.com/_QBLtraYVqGw/SVwLyaq9awI/AAAAAAAAF4I/ebOg9mdcWxc/s288/DSC03681.JPG"" />

But we did find time to stop for the Road Trip Champion Breakfast.

McDonald's biscuit and a hash brown

For the last few years I've gone to Arkansas by myself - without Katie. But this year she came too. We played ""roommates,"" going back into the closet for a couple of days. It was a sacrifice we both decided to make. I am so glad she got to meet my family! 

We managed to find time to drive around the town and visit a flea market!

<B>I'm done with my first semester of grad school!</b>

Wow. I made it. I didn't fail quit panic or freak out. 

The documentary project I've been working on the last two months was a huge success. It has been altered from a linear-based documentary film to a web-based collection of gender stories, which will expand the meaning of gender AND documentary. I'm excited and humbly intimidated to get this project off the ground. 

But first, winter break. I have plans for cleaning, baking, organizing, IKEA, poetry readings and reading poetry, the holidaze, and not doing any schoolwork.

1. Wrapping paper or gift bags? Wrapping paper, preferably from something around the house. 

2. Real tree or Artificial? All my life we had a real tree, and then when my sister and I lived together we got a real one too. But, my lord were those needles hard to clean up! So...I get the artificial vibe. Currently, I have a little foot and a half tall fake tree. I got it for, seriously, two dollars. 

3. When do you put up the tree? It has varied over the years. Sometimes it's a mad dash the day before Christmas, other times it's around Thanksgiving. 

4. When do you take the tree down? WELL into January. 

5. Do you like eggnog? No, no, and no. 

6. Favorite gifts received as a child? Gosh...I don't remember a ""favorite."" I do remember waking up to a lot of our gifts set up and in working order. It was like waking up to a toy store! 

7. Hardest person to buy for? Probably my mom. She's a lady who takes care of herself. 

8. Easiest person to buy for? Katie, cause she makes it easy. 

9. Do you have a nativity scene? Hahahaha...no. Tho I could make a really offensive one. Hmmm...

10. Mail or email Christmas cards? Mail, if I get around to it. I usually find a humiliating picture of myself and print it on a lot of sheets of paper, then stick it in an envelope with a non-religious holiday greeting. 

11. Worst Christmas gift you ever received? Anything pink. Actually, I am remembering a bright pink sweatsuit with a built-in vest that my grandmother gave me when I was a kid. 

12. Favorite Christmas Movie? Straight up, Home Alone. 

13. When do you start shopping for Christmas? I usually pick a weekend between Thanksgiving and Christmas to get it all done. But this year the semester has to end before I can even think about it. 

14. Have you ever recycled a Christmas present? Yes. 

15. Favorite thing to eat at Christmas? At my mammaw's - Scalloped Chicken (which isn't scalloped at all. It's this long process that involves rending chicken fat. But fuck me is it delcious). And then, um, I have my way with the sweets. 

16. Lights on the tree? Yep! Even my little guy will get some lights. I prefer the variety of colored lights. Katie does not. 

17. Favorite Christmas song? Classic - Winter Wonderland. Otherwise - Wonderful Christmas Time (yes, the one by Wings).

18. Travel at Christmas or stay home? Nowadays we stay home for the actual Day, and travel to Arkansas either the weekend before or after. After my parents got divorced and we moved to Michigan, my sister and I always spent Christmas with my dad. 

19. Can you name all of Santa's reindeer's? Yes, I can. 

20. Angel on the tree top or a star? Star! We had to retire the star we've had since we were kids. But we got a new one. It lights up. But it's not the same. Ho hum. 

21. Open the presents Christmas Eve or morning? Morning! ""The sooner you go to sleep the sooner morning will come."" - my Nena

22. Most annoying thing about this time of the year? The frickin' Christmas songs on the radio after Halloween (I agree!)

23. Favorite ornament theme or color? Just throw it all on the tree! 

24. Favorite for Christmas dinner? Something with easy clean-up. 

25. What do you want for Christmas this year? An iPod Touch, 2nd Generation. 

26. Who is most likely to respond to this? Grayson!"

That National Fatwa Council's chairman, Abdul Shukor Husin, said many Muslims fail to understand that yoga's ultimate aim is to be one with a god of a different religion - an explanation disputed by many practitioners who say yoga need not have a religious element.

Messy-haired and bra-less I take a seat on the couch, clear the coffee table and spread out the paper. Take that first glorious sip of coffee, and breathe. 

I have learned a few things this semester. I've learned that I really have to say what I mean, but not necessarily mean what I say. That meaning can come later. I have learned that I define what is meaningful, that sometimes I have to take myself seriously. I've learned how hard that is. 

I've learned that love bends, and the bend in the curve is terrifying. I've learned we built strong roots at the beginning; and I am thankful for them now. I have learned that I am not alone; yet I have seen loneliness rise from within. 

I feel alive, in the sense that I feel my pride with my pain - intensity.

Park bathrooms are safer with my gender identity than gas stations. But the question still remains...

We stopped for a picnic.

And came across some interesting places.

We also found a covered bridge...

""No, babe, you're not talkative...you're lonely.""

I am. I miss her. Grad school stole her brain/heart/soul.

I am in the very beginning stages of producing a documentary about the difference between ""gender"" and ""sex,"" and why the distinction isn't used correctly more often. I am hoping to present it at the Feminism(s) & Rhetoric(s) conference next fall, which my program is sponsoring.

The impetus for this project is an assignment for my Multimedia Writing class, but I am seeing its production go beyond (waaaay beyond) this semester and become a huge piece in my portfolio. 

I am making a detailed plan and schedule right now, as well as doing research and stocking archival footage available via the public domain (<a href=""http://www.internetarchive.org"">www.internetarhcive.org</a>). 

I will also be conducting interviews, which is probably the most anxiety invoking aspect of this project. But I have a list of very (very very very) smart people I hope will lend their voices to this documentary. So, don't be surprised if an email shows up requesting your participation. Just sayin'. 

In my other class, Digital Rhetoric, I'm supposed to be creating a viral video in the next couple of weeks. I'm considering personal humiliation right now. People love to see other people make damn fools of themselves. Have you ever seen me lipsynch in the car? At the mall? In a park? Tomfoolery!

Classes seem to be going well, though I still feel like a rowboat in the middle of the ocean."

"event","I picked up some Michigan-grown tomatoes yesterday at the City Market (along with a bag of Michigan apples and an eggplant for Eggplant Parmesan tonight). I am slow roasting the tomatoes with garlic, onion, fresh thyme, and oregano right now for the tomato sauce of tonight's Eggplant Parm. Our house smells amazing. 

There are loads of laundry being spun and lots of studying being done. What a rhymtastic sentence that was. I just burned a couple of cd's for my friends. And have plans to make Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies this afternoon. 

The TV is off and the music is on - so far we've gone through the new Ani cd (Red Letter Year), Good Dog Bad Dog by Over the Rhine, and right now we're listening to an awesome downtempo compilation called Cosmic Funk. 

Ruby is in her condo (the mudroom) and is NOT whining (so far). 

Really the only thing missing from a content life right now is seeing Mo and John. I miss you guys!

Didn't make it up to the rally yesterday, but I DID watch a live videocast online. The best part about that was I wore nothin' but my bathrobe. 

I had a major FAIL moment during my presentation last night. Basically the Powerpoint I spent two days working on didn't launch because my new computer has the most recent version of the program. I go to load my presentation on the user experience of the Righteous Babe Records website and it's not there. I had to wing it. 

And then, THEN!, at the end of my presentation my professor says to the class, ""This website has a major problem. Can anyone tell me what it is?"" Mr. Smartypants (who's actually really smart and funny, but still a smartypants) raises his hand and says, ""Blah blah blah, the design is different on some pages."" Which I FAILED to pick up on. Thanks, buddy. My Powerpoint FAILS and then I FAIL. More failure please! 

In lieu of all these awesome failures I am taking the day off from school today, which just means I'm not studying or doing any homework. Eff it! Instead, my love and I are gonna head into Old Town, snap some pics of Katie's lockies by the river, hit up the city market for fresh produce, and stroll around Joann Fabrics. Actually, Katie usually has to drag me around JoJo's. God I get bored in there."

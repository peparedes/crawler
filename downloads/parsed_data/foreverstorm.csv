"event","Godhand was awesome.
I found a good distraction in the sci-fi comedy RPG ""Paranoia"".
Still rarely updating to avoid pages of attempts at rationalising my problems.
Worked out that the random guilt and emo moods seem to come after I feel genuinely good.
Had a childish but awesome dream last night, where an otter was in love with me. Its funny, life can wear at you and dull you down over time, and im stuck at a point where I keep confusing 'content' with 'survivable circumstances', and yet, something as simple as a dream like this can puncture through all that 'gray' and actually touch you. Dreams are good like that. I was some kind of small creature too, though im not sure what, and we ended up jumping between the tops of highrise buildings in a game of tag in a cuteish bullettime way. So fun.

Not a great deal to report otherwise. Same old same old. No closer to being inspired to a lifes masterwork, no closer to breaking the granite shell of my internal drama, though I did briefly fix my sleeping patterns, but I broke them again about a week ago. Oh yes, and the worlds populace smells a little like wee-wee. :3

"event","..I finally saw it. For those of you who dont read titles, im talking about the Silent Hill movie.

Not bad at all. It definately captured the spirit of the games well, it was, what it was supposed to be. Even if a person had never played the Silent Hill games, they should be able to appreciate this as a well above-average horror film. I like it because its Silent Hill, and to be honest even if the film itself had sucked, i'd just be glad to soak it up just to see what film directors could bring to life. The first monstery encounter seriously gave me shivers, but the rest I was pretty immune to. Always the trouble with horror films, if your pace is off by even a little, people become immune to the horror in the film. Too much gore/killing? It becomes an eyesore, gets boring. Too little? The film feels a bit empty. Silent Hill had it just about right for the most of it, and although im not a great fan of films, I pretty much liked it. Really liked how they used the actual soundtracks from the games to fill out the film (because lets face it, they suit it perfectly), but the film lacked a little something to see it through the full length and make it outstanding. The entire thing might be offputting to people who are only used to conventional psycho-killer horrors, because the story is a tad metaphysical and hard to follow if you never kept up with the games.

Basically, the film is a mock-up of the original Silent Hill game on the playstation. Thankfully, I dont see a sequel happening. It did good, real good for a ""movie of"" type, but its used all its tricks, and it filled out the storyline well enough. I didnt care much for the ending, personally, but it was the journey that mattered. Unfortunately my father was already getting up out of his seat when the credits rolled and ""You're Not Here"" played to back it (opening theme to Silent Hill 3).... because I have a sneaky feeling there might have been an extra bit after the credits. Should have stayed, but my butt was numb from the seat. Great, now it'll have me wondering..

Teh british badger gives it 4 out of 5 crests of the sun.
Its imperfect, but by recent films standards, its kinda a refreshing change. Besides, im fanboy enough to overlook the things it lacked, and simply enjoy the special effects for once. Just once, mind. ;)"

"event","I finally got around to the coin tossing again. I have to seriously agree with what it said.
For all my struggling and beating myself up, I have achieved nothing, and it feels wrong. I know I will not change, even when resolute. I have always known why this is, in some way, but I didnt like to admit it. Fear isnt the entire answer. In some way, the pain feels good. This is not addiction, nor masochism. There is something about it that even though it hurts, the pain deep down inside feels like progress, and I dont know why. Hurt has always inspired me, slowly smouldered at me, as if there is a phoenix somewhere in this pile of ash, hiding, trying to rise up. What strength I have is not nearly enough, as long as my problems obstruct my way.

I have completed my last task, and that was to stop moving forwards, and to turn and look behind me, face my past with both eyes open. It scared me, it made me more fearful, but I understand it a lot more now. My new task, is to endure quietly. My life is in a bad situation, and fighting will do nothing. For all the hiding I have been doing, inside, I have been fighting fiercly, my emotions and thoughts constantly aflame, beating mercilessly against the jail my problems have created. It has been for nought. The solution lays in acceptance. I must gather what energy I have, I must muster this little shimmering river inside of me, the warmth I have shown others, and wait. I must recharge, and endure. No more pursuing an escape, it is eating all of my waking life, all of my energy, all of my thoughts and feelings, the passion to escape is devouring me, and leaving nothing to truly live with. The situation will change, but for now I must be calm. The wall of ash has not moved once since it has set, so I need a new approach, or for the nature of the ash to change. It will change. A poisoned creature does not become well the moment the antidote is given, it takes time to work. Flushing with poison and struggling willful antidotes, it appears that the only thing I am left without in my bloodstream, is my own blood. I need time to soak it all up, both the venom and the antivenom. I need to simply be, for a time. In this state, it explains why none of my creations or efforts could even be born. They choke, just as I do.

I must feel the pain, but I must not focus upon it. The key was laid inside of me all along, and it was the very thing I tried to escape and fight against, the pain, the fear. It is that which will truly free me. I must learn to let it flow again. I have devoted so much time of my life to the mind, the spirit, the 'heaven' element of my existance. The 'earth' element has been neglected, the emotion, the feeling, the body, the self which resides inside. I must reattach to myself, but detach from all else, and wait. Reintegration with myself, but full detachment from the world. I always thought I was detached, but I wasnt, I always cared. I always got involved with things I knew would instantly hurt me, just to protect others, just to simply be there, even if I could do nothing, my presance would be shown. It is my time, to be selfish, and though I may still care, I have to attend to this now.

""The warrior who fights in heaven, requires offering at the shrine of earth""
For accepting I simply need to withdraw fully, and accept the soon-to-come pain as well as the soon-to-come external hurt, it certainly seems hard. I thought I was good at being a coward, but it seems im actually going to have to try. Letting go, being uninvolved, simply not being there, letting the world dissolve for a time. I fear I will become a monster, if I realise my own self again. I dont want to be selfish, but it is time I build my cocoon and sleep for now.

I hope you understand."

An anime with an ending that doesnt feel unfinished, heh.
I've always felt an affinity and fondness towards wolves, so this anime appealed to me from ages ago, I fell in love with it. But now that I watched it over these past few days, finished all 30 episodes (there are 30, some only watched up to 26, the final four were only on DVD, never aired). 

It just moved me. Only way to say it.

"event","Why? Why me? Why now?
I absolutely ADORE Wolfs Rain, and im only on episode eight. What I thought was the end of the first DVD wasnt actually the end of the first DVD at all. After episode seven I pressed ""next"", and nothing happened, the chapter slider at the top was all the way to the right, that meant I had seen everything and it was time to move on to the next DVD. I switched it over to DVD 2 and pressed play.

Then it happened.
Filler episodes. Now, these arent so bad, I could skip over them, but something was wrong. When I finished carefully skipping the filler episodes, the story wasnt the same, everything was different. So, I thought, that there must be a little extra something woven into the filler episodes to explain why they are where they are. So I went back, and I watched a bit. Thats funny, I thought, these filler episodes suck ass. Why? Because they REVEAL THINGS THAT HAVENT HAPPENED IN THE STORY YET. I thought it was just explaining something in a terrible way, but it wasnt, it was SPOILING THE FUCKING STORY. That hurt. The one thing that actually stirred any real emotion in me since.. since.. well.. as far as my limited memory can remember.. and THIS has to happen to it! :(
Frustrated, I googled for an episode guide site, and find out the last episode I watched BEFORE the filler pieces kicked in. As it turns out, I was missing several episodes between the end of the first DVD and the start of the second. My heart sank. My heart sank HEAVY. I was determined to make sure I hadnt overlooked something, but if the chapter-slider is all the way to the right, and pressing 'next' does nothing, then thats it, DVD over.

I was wrong.
It turns out that there is another menu you can access through right click, that displays not just episodes 1-7, but the rest of the episodes I was looking for. But you know what? As much of a relief that was, a whole bunch of the story im about to watch has been spoiled for me. Of ALL the things that could have happened.... this had to happen.

Why to this? This is about the only thing that has emotionally effected me in a non-negative way in a long while, its something I look forward to watching on a night, to break up the monotony of not really living, just existing. And this just... ruined my night, I guess. Im going to try carry on watching it in order, the way its supposed to be watched, but now im going to be paranoid that i've missed something, as well as having to get rid of this lingering shitty feeling around me and in my gut -again-.

"event","Elfin Lied, one of the anime series I got for christmas, was as expected. I tried to tolerate it, I really did, because some parts you can work out on your own... but the translation is astonishingly shitty. Elfid Lied is about people with a strange psychic ability, and the entire series is very graphic on the gore side of things, there is a fair bit of nudity, but the main part of it all, is the ongoing dark theme. The series portrays a lot about the dark side of human beings, but its hard to get into it when the translation and subtitles are terrible. At one point a little dog runs up to a girl wading in the ocean at a beach, it barks. The subtitles actually translated the bark to : ""Doggie!"". When someone makes a quiet gasping sound, its translated to : ""Oosp!"". When someone is sobbing, that also gets added to the subtitles as : ""Hoot! Hoot! Hoot!"". A character called Nyuu is randomly referred to as ""Leo"", which confused me a lot until I worked out who they were referring to. What could have been a dark little series was completely turned to garbage by the translation. I got as far as the episode they take Nyuu to school, and just gave up at that point.

I had yet another look around using google, and I cant even find some kind of fansub file to run along with the DVD to give me a better idea what they're talking about. I know an english dubbed version of Elfin Lied exists, but i've already paid for this once and im not going to sell it off to someone else when I know the translation is that bad. Oh well, I -did- decide to buy a second copy of the Wolfs Rain series, just to get the english dubs (as the first boxset I bought of Wolfs Rain was just like Elfin Lied, shitty translation/subtitles). I didnt mind paying for another boxset, because its going to be a good series, I seriously feel that much for certain. I can either start watching Wolfs Rain now (its only 10:30pm), or I can wait until tomorrow.

Anime aside, life is still incredibly simple, but my emotions are giving me shit. To be honest, I feel better hiding away right now. As much of as weak-ass idiot as I might be, and how easy my life is, I just cant take any remote kind of stress because of this shit going on inside of me. Hence the anime, a distraction.

It turns out that LJ signs me out strangely often, despite the settings, so friends-only entries are invisible to me... and I only see them when I come to update, rather than when I peek in as I pass by.

Sorry Ryn, for being late with my huggage, but at least you know why I didnt respond with lightening speed. You know I wuv your hugs :3"

"event","Silent Hill. 2's Lucid Sonic Delusions. Why are these things so effective at being disturbing? Why is it that although they are abstract, do I feel so intensely familiar with them? To the brain, to the mind, they make little sense, but still they evoke fear. Not the kind of conditioned fear that I have as a human being, but that deeply unsettingly fear. Like you were traumatised so badly that you forgot something..

Wondering why they feel so familiar, I think back to the suffocating sound I get in my dreams. And I remember a short dream I had, during an operation as a child, the one with the shed. Why are these things so disturbing? Though abstract, they scare us. They should only confuse us, but they disturb. I think my mind has grasped part of the answer tonight, but it is hard to put into words. Even that damned ""Puppy Whirl"" animation of stickmen was disturbing. Its not why it was disturbing, its more of why its so familiar. Especially the cut up images that flick between different things. Its like walking through a garden full of flowers, in the middle of the day, only to get intermittant visions, flashes of an alternate-world version of the garden, where there are no flowers, just infertile dry soil, and a person you dont recognise planting broken fingernails into it, the air hotter than before, but nighttime. You know that kind of horror-scene in films, games, books? Like visions, visions that are like flashbacks but not real? The familiarity with this kind of stuff is worrying, especially with these little 'spiders' and 'wisps' in the corner of my eyes now, it has been a little more frequent recently.

I do realise though, that there is more to these over-imaginative flashes of disturbing images I get occasionally. I was convinced that the nature of death, was that entropic drifting until your place came up again, but there is something that truly unsettles me now. Some dreams that I have pushed out of mind, return now. That dream of the operation on my stomach, the pain was so real, and they said they had given me a drug that would make me forget, and tried to reassure me to stop trying to thrash around. The scary thing was, I only realised I had that dream, about a month afterwards. No, that is the wrong subject. Yes that dream was freakily odd, but this is different. The nature of death. My view on the nature of death is vulnerable now, it may change.

Its strange, I know the nature of death, but not where it leads.
But now, I know these new thoughts to be unreal, but still they are familiar. The fear is familiar too, I have been terror stricken before, in some state of torture. I cannot recall if there was pain, but there was terror. What was it? I cant remember but I am compelled to break through this barrier, to learn.... something. I know if I find out i'll want to forget again.

That fear, I remember that fear in my dreams as a child. ""The Starer"" on the hallway landing, paralysed. In my dreams, something was there, was it intelligent? I remember being so fearful of it that when I woke up, I would run and check my bedroom light, then the landing light, to make sure I was really awake. I remember waking my parents up, to try and reassure myself I was really awake, and not about to be paralysed again, staring straight ahead like I only exist in a 1-second timeframe, my mind trapped too, and someone, something, staring at me, practically nose-to-nose, unblinking, unmoving, like a reflection, but a reflection that sometimes I couldnt see, but still felt.

Another little memory. A film I saw on Sky Movies... an interesting yet very low budget movie called ""UFO : The Mc.Pherson Tape"". Im not easily scared by horror movies, I might jump, but I never really scare. This movie scared me. Not because of the special effects or bad costumes and Blair-Witch style camerawork.. just two things :

1) The strange 'scramble' effect on the camera, the quietening/slight distortion of the sound as it happened too. That was VERY familiar, it scared me just that they had that detail. I dont know why.

2) At the point where the kid holding the camera goes to change his pants, and he goes to leave but the alien intercepts him on the way out? That reminded me a lot of the 'starer' deal, the being unable to move or respond or really do anything. Trying to call for help or scream does little more than make you breathe heavier, your throat seemingly unable to contract to shape a sound. But the final part that REALLY got me, was when the alien let him go... the sound that the kid made really disturbed me. Its quiet, like a whimper, or a gently staggered exhale. That was very familiar to me too. 

How can such a cheesy film bring out these things in me? I want to know the origins of these things in me, but im already afraid about what I might find. At the end of that second point mini paragraph, I had to turn my light on and put on some music, because I was getting freaky images again. I have to sleep soon but I think im going to be staying awake for a long while. I'll have to decide tomorrow if I want to pursue all this. Truth has its costs too, right? If I do more thinking on this, I might stand to lose a lot of sleep, and bathe in a lot of this fear. I cant stand that feeling of fear in my gut, for some reason I really wanted to just get on the floor and curl up very tight.

I thought I knew the nature of death but these strange, abstract, disturbing things definately feel like something i've experienced... if only in the lucid dreams I had as a child, they still affected me on some deep level, even if I learned to shut it all out. There is definately more to this, but I need to get it all out of my head now. So far i've managed to attribute my staying hidden from people to 'adapting to live with my problems', but this kind of fear is a whole different level. 

It makes me fear for my soul. Why is this?
I have undoubtedly faced death before this life, as we are born from the same unknown that we go to when we die, but this might be a book I really shouldnt open. If this is really a part of existance, or even if this is something unique to my journey in existance, or even if this is just some temporary thing I will carry with me in this one life, I will undoubtedly have to face it in full force at some point. If I do not take these quiet days as chance to prepare myself, then when the real event arrives, it may entirely destroy me, if harmful.

I know I make things sound dramatic, and I know I make them long-winded, but attempting to put these feelings, thoughts, and memories into words is harder than it seems. Words can fall short, and I think for this, you need to simply experience it. Perhaps this is my first real taste of fear? Fear for the physical is one thing, but this is on a completely different level, where you are naked and unprepared no matter how you approach it..

I may be unable to help people for a time now. If I am correct, this may be the door that leads me straight on the path towards insanity, and I really shouldnt be trying to support others whilst im trying to figure this out. If I do in fact start to deterioate in terms of behaviour and coherancy, im sorry, but this may just be who I am under all of my mental lockdown. Maybe its time I let go of all my control, and figure out who I really am.

So for now, I shall regain my strength with deaths more social sister, sleep.
Perhaps this too will pass with all other things, but will I be able to really pursue this? Or will I ignore it so that I can continue operating in sync with this world? I would run some of this by the shamans I have met online, but most of them dont take me seriously. For all their experience, they are still young and take much simply by tone. If only I knew someone else into this odd, spooky stuff, someone who wouldnt stab me in the back or ignore me for not being of the same walk of life.

Didnt I say I was going to try sleep?
Well, i'll lay in bed and think on this some more, better make a start. I seriously hope that 'mystery subject X' deal doesnt kick in when I do. If I enter the comatose, mentally suffocated state whilst this subject is on the mind, it'll be absolute hell for me..

Be well."

"event","Whee, the depressive dip again. Doesnt matter how many times you hit it, it always hurts, and you'd think you'd get used to it, eh? I had a bit of a cry today, helped me feel a bit better in the end, but also made me kinda feel worse. Generally when you feel terrible you cant cry, because people can hear/see, and its normally not a good thing to shower you with attention.. seeing as they always follow it up with stuff that makes it worse. I wouldnt mind crying around people if something obviously painful happened, but you cant explain depression, or the built-up hollow pain of only god-knows how many months of weird internal stress, so to them, nothing is wrong, and you cry. People already see tears as a sign of weakness enough as it is, and although they wouldnt mock you to your face, its surprising how many would slide a few jokes about it around, or how amusing they actually find it. Even if they have the fringe amount of respect needed not to make those jokes whilst you're sat there, as if you dont exist, you can often tell when they've happened.. and it sucks to hear them in distant passing.

Been digging myself up a little, the numb period i've been in has gone on for a long time, so I decided to pull myself up out of the dirt by the ears, just to get a little air. As per usual, lack of numbness let all the usual crazy crap flood in. Looked over some jobs too whilst I was at it, and even really easy stuff just overwhelms me in thought. Trying to push myself for a change, but even honestly thinking about something you dread, with the intent of doing it, it drains you. Im going to have to do something different, because I can honestly say that if I dont throw myself into the white-hot fire of fear now, im never going to do it.... cowering away from the shadows my paranoia and experiences keep casting, isnt going to lead to a content life.

I took one of these online quizzes again, which i've taken about four times now, over the space of a few years... but even answering it seriously and honestly, these were the results I got :

Well, its 5:20am, so im going to try peeling myself away from the computer, and stop trying to 'cure' the bad feeling in my gut. I always do that, keeps me up late. Hoping i'll find something online to lift my spirits enough, to actually feel that sleeping will be a good thing.. otherwise I just wait for absolute exhaustion and it always comes at about 9-11am, and I need to be up at lunchtime to go out with my father. I havent seen him in 3 weeks now, because the last two weekends I was exhausted at 10am-ish, and HAD to sleep.
I really dont like the idea of antidepressants, never have. This one, however, isnt a fear thing. But I may have to ask about them, because if I dont do something, I will remain the way I am now until the day I die... and that is not my intent... I just want to adapt, to be content and able to live stably, without relying on a source that could shrug and give me the middle finger with any given excuse (government).

Goodnight for now."

I know to most it wouldnt mean very much, but to me, online friends, close ones, are still friends all the same. I decided to put someone I considered a friend, or at least a friendly acquaintance, on block. I just didnt like it was all. Not the first time i've had to put someone I considered a friendly face on block, simply because I didnt have the energy or stamina to put up with them. I dont have a great deal going for me, and its easy to wreck my mood and send me into a depressed spiral for more than one night. Yeah, over-fragile as I am, I just didnt like doing it. When you can see someone is a good person, but you really just cant get through to them. Dont get me wrong, im not emotional about this at all, but it plays on my mind somewhat. Just dont like doing stuff like that, is all. Has to be the first thing in a long while that i've done, where I dont have some unforseen emotional blowback as a result. So, this is how people deal with the stupid stuff... just not letting it touch them at all. Bah. Doesnt feel right, but I guess its all you can really do, given that stuff doesnt always turn out the way it should.

Nobody is perfect, but sometimes the way people behave really irks me. Shouldnt have needed to block 'em, but I did. And that really twists my tits. Well, got bigger things playing on my mind as per usual, and I dont need extra things dragging me down. Better shuffle up so my bro can snatch the comp (8am) and I can get a few hours sleep before I get up again. Knowing me, that means more than just a few hours sleep. xD

...there has to be a reason why everything keeps resetting to this, no matter what I try. I might for the sake of it, plan ahead, but have a week where I dont actually try to sleep as im supposed to. See what happens. I know i'll go through a few days where I actually sleep at daylight and wake at midnight. Perhaps though, i'll see what I feel like."

Change needs effort, and im not going to make an effort on something I dont really think I care about.

I guess thats fucked up too. Recurring, distressing problems, but I seriously dont -really- seem to care. I want them to go away, but I dont seem to care about it, just like anything else. Blargh. The other funny thing is that after I said I went to go look out my window? I didnt, I had to be up in 4 hours at that point, to go out and fish up the board money for my grandfather, so I didnt. 

If I cant get inspired, life needs to smack me across the ass with a baseball bat, maybe that'll make me care and DO SOMETHING. Just, hiding again for now.
Ah well, for now, pepsi max.."

"event","And now.. the public version of a recent friends-only post (shit perhaps it should be private) :

People hurt :(
That much never changes. Its like a farce, really. The way I let myself get suckerpunched each time by it. Headfirst into the same steaming pile of shite no matter what I try, and it hurts bad, and like an insect with half its body crushed, I drag my painfilled carcass around in circles, twitching for hours 'till the pain stops one way or another. I always do that. When it hurts bad, I twitch, I 'reflex' by trying to find release. Why is it always so hard to find? All of these little things that hurt me all add to the big tumbleweed of shite, and none of it ever gets any closure...
Is this really self-discipline that stops me from saying what I really think about the people who hurt me? I dont want to make them hurt, or feel bad, or upset.. so I never say anything. Why be shitty to someone? I just... sometimes want them to know how they hurt me, and I already know that by saying it, they criticise me, or shrug it off. There is never an apology, there is never understanding, just ""you're wrong, im right"", and no flickering sign of regret at having hurt me.

Im tired of pain. The constant fear, whilst trying to avoid the pain.
The burning the months away, trying to distract from it. I was just 20 yesterday.
Its surprisingly sadenning for me, whenever my old friend Emma used to ring. She'd tell me what she had been up to in the last 6 months between phonecalls, then she'll say : ""So what've you been up to?"". What can I say?
""Nothing really. I still spend most of my time indoors, away from people. Im interested in nothing. I have no reason to go outside. I dont really see things any more. I have insomnia, but when I finally get to sleep, I sleep far far too much and dont care if I wake up.""

22..
*sobs*
Almost a full year has gone by and I havent even really looked out the window.. in case someone looks at me. I go about life blinkered, never taking in the details I crave to. Eyes to the floor, run..
People ask me what something in my own room/house/area looks like, and I dont know. People from out of town come down my very own street and ask me where a shop is that is 2 streets away, and I dont know where it is.
just too much for tonight.
waiting for that bit of release, for the pain to stop for now

8:22am, dont think anybody would really be around..
*goes to look at the space outside his bedroom window, properly*"

"event","Winter is coming.. and many things will sleep again.
I spend my life in hibernation, curled up in some place that offers me any warmth..

Where has the time gone?
It was only yesterday I remember smiling at the naked trees outside of the living room windows.. chuckling when in the morning light, the nearest of them appeared to be blushing. Eccentric thoughts.
I never remember seeing the grow new coats of leafs, and already they will be falling to the ground, soon.

Its like that time I remember going to visit Emma in Brighton. There was a happyness within me, though the trip felt bad, I felt unwelcome, through no fault of the two who kept me when I had arrived... and I remember looking out of the coach window, looking at the sky, the clouds. I never see the clouds, and I live my entire life with nothing to keep me busy. I do not work, and have no real responsibilities or chores... and yet, I miss the sky, I do not notice the passing of the months. I was sad, to see the sky. It was beautiful, and being able to see it really just made me feel better, but at the same time, there was a quiet little chill, when I realised this is how i've come to live my life.
I have looked directly at a sunset, and understood it to be beautiful, but I just could not see it in my eyes.

I need to find a change within myself. If not now, then eventually.
Winter has always been the harshest time of the year, but it has always been kind to my spirit. I should go for walks, once the bitter air sets in. The change that will save me from a life of pointless self-captivity, will not come swiftly. Instead, I will work at nursing inspiration back into my life, and see if I can feel the desire to do something with the time I have been given.

I will hope to defeat fear, and reclaim myself from my weakness, before my time is up.
Why is being strong so bloody hard?"

"event","Apparently Ragdoll Kung-Fu is coming out in just over 2 weeks time, and they're getting distributed through Steam. Naturally i'll be getting a copy, but I realised because it'll only be online order, im going to need a credit card. Hopefully my father will let me use his again, and i'll just hand him the notes for it. Anyways, I had a good look through the RDKF forums, and found out what I needed to know, to design my own characters. Strangely enough, i've been content. I spend most of the day drawing and tweaking the imagefiles for the new skins/characters, and im content. Its difficult, and there are always little bugs in my skins popping up, but im content. Odd really. 
^^;

First up, a link to the game in question :
http://personal.lionhead.com/mhealey/index.html
Followed by a link to in-game movies from the beta testers :
http://www.ireallydontcare.com/rdkf/movies.html
Yep, its freestyle quasi-2D fighting. Me loves ragdoll-style physics games! :3
Now for my <lj-cut text=""skins"">

-----------
1) The baggy ninja guy in blue.. that took me a while. Was my first skin.
2) No real name, that was pretty quick. Filename : Grumps
3) Hong Kong Phooey, took me from 4pm until just after midnight. So many little bugs just to make a solid chestpiece, but he looks as he is supposed to. Im certain he'll be a riot once he's in the game.
4) A modified Haku from Samurai Jack! Took me an hour less than the last skin, but for a skin entirely in black it gave me a LOT of problems. His other faces arent that much different from the one you see there, but it saved on time, whilst giving him an over-focused effect. Funny ^^
5) Its Kai Archelon! :D Well, a younger, meaner looking version of him. The face is a bit dodgey and his wraps look odd, but this'll be my personal skin for definate.
(click them you fool!)

"event","Ventage post, please wear hard hards and goggles.
----
Its not hard to grasp why I get annoyed at times.

<lj-cut text=""The full rant"">
Member = Angry at ?,
Member = Needless insult at Ari,
Others = Ignore,

Ari = Tells Member not to insult.
Member = Insults more,
Ari = Tells Member that pointless insults arent welcome.
Member = Insults, leaves.

Ari = Leaves member alone for now.
Ari = Angry, remains calm.
Member = Arrives later.

Ari = Waits, then tells Member he thinks they were not nice.
Ari Thinks = A chance to apologise if desired, or at least say why angry.
Member = Needless insult.
Ari = Warns officially not to insult.
Others = Criticise
---------------------
People say I throw my power around too much, but have you ever actually stopped to look at how many times I make something official? You're just using the fact im a moderator to make it LOOK like I am, just so you can validate your childish little spree. Im not sure how many of you have noticed, but I very rarely pull an 'official warning' or anything like that, I am a member of the glen FIRST and a moderator second, the way it should be. Stop making excuses, and just grow up.
---------------------
Here is something that is VERY easy to understand :
Main rule : Politeness, dont act like a jerk.

Want to know what would happen if I ignored this stuff? :
Member = Needless insult
Others = Ignore.
Ari = Ignore.
Member = Learns unwelcomed insults against ari have no repercussion. Insult frequency +1.
--------------------
Something that I just love too, as a follow up :

Ari = Needless insult
Others = Criticise, become angered
Member = Needless insult volley
Others = Sigh at member, but otherwise ignore.
--------------------
I am a member of the furget glen first, and a moderator second. The rules also apply to those argueing with me too, if someone is being a fuckwit, they should be shown its not welcome. Not just by me. I'd do it for anyone else, and have done in the past. Why? I hate arguements? Because a good friend, no matter how close or distant, doesnt just watch someone act like that and say/do nothing. Im growing sick of it.

If I do anything as a moderator, people make me out to be abusing my powers and throwing my weight around. ANYTHING. I say ""Life, those insults before were seriously uncalled for, dont do it again :/"", im instantly the Hitler/Stalin incarnate. WTF is with that? Do you expect me to say ""please"" to someone who is just trying to wind me up? I mean, the fact that I got insulted twice for nothing, out of nowhere as a result of a conversation about EBAY ffs... thats all groovy, nobody cares about that... but if I even bat an eyelid as a result? Holy shit roll out the artillery Ari is on the rampage!

You have no problem with someone saying ""Moron"" ""Piss off"" ""Fuck you"" and typing in caps because of a conversation over EBAY which wasnt even heated.
But I say that the insults were uncalled for, after I let them go cool off from whatever crawled up their ass, without saying a word after the 20 minute criticism+grilling about ebay... AGAIN without bringing my moderatorship into it, just saying it was out of line, then holy shit, better stick your oar in because im a wild runaway nuke-on-a-trolley. Better tame me before I get some self-esteem :D.

Bobskunk gave me the ability to be a moderator in good faith.
You dont have to understand it, and if you dont like what I do and wont talk to me honestly about it, take a log and show it to Bobskunk. He can talk over it with me. Talk. Sensibly. Realistically. Without bleeding-heart chatroom politics. Without childish insults. Talk.

If you treat me like im powertripping, i'll GIVE you a powertrip. Im tired of talking to you people as just myself, just a furket glen regular, and people USING the fact that im a moderator as an EXCUSE to stick your criticisms and suggestions where they arent wanted. At least wait for a moment or two before you OFFER them. And I dont care whether the insult was 'old', to me, a few hours ago isnt old. Especially not when half your time in the glen seems to be spent argueing with someone who just wont leave you be. If I've done something you dont like, PM me and we'll talk like adults, dont hide it until you have to throw shit at me like a bloody ape.

And before someone leaves a criticism here in the replies to this entry? Yeah, its kinda childish, its called emotion. I get emotions from time to time. Deal with it. There is a reason im posting this here, because face to face, you dont get it. Because when I talk to you, you brush it off as just me being 'high maintenance', or being all hyper-sensitive again. Im posting this because im sick to fucking death of all the arguements. I cant get through a week without something being dropped on me. I know im not perfect, but at least im working on MY shit, instead of just practically encouraging shitty behaviour, whilst punishing someone for dealing with it as a member instead of throwing their mod powers around.
If I say ""Dont talk to me like that"", its not a moderator command, its a human being getting pissed off at the mouthy little brat in front of him, so DONT try to make me look like an asshole moderator.. because im seriously tired of even the moderators who are PRESENT when this stuff happens, but do absolutely nothing.. but can somehow still find time to walk me through the finer points of what I didnt execute perfectly the way they would have done it.. literally seconds after the event happened.. and then start sighing when I mention the fact this isnt the first time its happened. At LEAST give me a break before you try to push your pointers on me.

Because the fact is, i've lost count with the number of times this has happened.
But rather than wonder if we should stop people from treating me like this, you decide to tell me -I- should change.

Im not the rooms punching bag. If they or you cant respect that, its not my problem. I am still a regular, an old timer in fact, so I think I qualify for a little coverage of the ""dont act towards others like a brat"" rule. If you wont give me it, -I- will. Dont like it? Talk to Bobskunk and stop pestering me whilst I do my job."

"event","Finally finished watching the full ""Full Metal Alchemist"" series, all 50 episodes of it. Or was it 51?
Sometimes a story can really hit home, and it was hitting some really familiar chords towards the end. I feel naked, and for some reason the nagging emotional hurt came back afterwards, quickly. It seems there are two grades of deep emotional pain in my life. The first is the surface tension created by never feeling safe, feeling judged and watched, trapped like a prisoner in a life im not brave or strong enough to break free from.. and the second kind, the pain that rises up from the very pit of my stomach and sits just below my ribs, a cold sensation that washes upwards in pulses, it hurts just because I feel sad. Thats the REAL pain that is at the root of my problem, im certain of it.

I want to feel that pain more. The numbness lets me survive but where the hurting should be, I simply suffer. I need to let this pain rise up, I have masked this for too long. Is it a hard step to unmask the real problem to myself? It hurt so fucking much when my family and friends brushed off my problems and told me I was stupid, I got sick of feeling sick when people only mocked me more, just for the way I was.. I learned to hide it, deny it, act normal. I got really good at acting like I dont want to bite my fingers off, I got good at being silent when I want to whimper like a dog in the corner of my room. I want to cry so much sometimes, but I dont let myself, it feels like it makes it worse.

Pretending there is nothing wrong with me is feeding the cancer inside of me. I have to let this demon out, I have to wake it up, but I know I cannot tame it. It will consume me and you have still not learned how to handle me without breaking me. Lack of humanity weakened me, careless handling has broken me, now what the fuck do I do?
No, this is right. This is how its supposed to be. I made that wish when I was a child. I was greedy for power, so I made the prayers, I made the wishes. Something, someone answered and gave me what I wanted. Only I was too young to want the right things. I havent healed the world. Wars are still happening. People still hate each other. What have I cured, strengthened or even protected? Nothing.

This pain, this sorrow, its part of a procedure of growing, becoming stronger. I have always known this, but its too much sometimes. Its like an anti-orgasm, like the pleasure is sucked from you.. replaced with a grim.. something. Have I grown yet? It still hurts but what is this achieving? FMA had one thing right, you need to sacrifice so that you can gain... but its not the things you give up that manifest your desires, its the hardships you face, the energy you burn, the feelings you survive through.

I am not losing myself, I am becoming more of what I should be."

"event","Woke up at 3:30pm today, got into bed late as per usual. The world was at peace around me and for once I felt well rested. The sky was overcast, and the air everywhere was cool. We had a rainfall just before I woke up, I could smell it in the air, but my grandfather confirmed it by mentioning it. Im not sure what it is about broody gray days, and the 'smell' of a rainfall that puts me in such a good mood. It just seems to erase the depression from inside of me, if just for a little time. Listened to a bunch of mp3's and for some reason I could really appreciate them. Instead of just hearing interesting noises, I actually listened to them. Normally I cant do that, even if I force myself to focus on them.
I missed talking to Michael today, but ah well. Hopefully he'll come sleep over again soon so we can finally see the last DVD of Full Metal Alchemist. I've been seriously holding back watching any of the other anime series I have (and have never watched before), because I dont like to 'wash away' the strength of the scenes in one anime, by getting involved with another series at the same time.

As another good side, I downloaded ""Ballance"" through a torrent. Its practically a meditation in the form of a game. Which reminds me, I need to find a few specific sounds online somewhere to meditate on. I figured that i've been getting very sloppy with my personal meditations recently, and thought about giving myself a little added protection in case I ever stumble out of body again. Meditating on images and sounds would seem to really help me, if I can summon the image or sound quickly, I can often manifest it as an effect. The stone-grinding loop sounds I have work well to make me 'immovable' or 'solid', in case of an entity trying to force me to go somewhere or do the old nightmare abduction deal, keeping the sound in mind helps you to will you to hold still. Same with being attacked, being out of body no real harm can come to you, but its possible to be overwhelmed by the fear or intensity of the attacks and essentially project a negative effect onto yourself. The sound of stone can help you to reaffirm that you are made of stone and unharmable, if you cannot entirely grasp that you are immortal there anyways. Another sound im after is that of steel cabling... the cord that holds elevators up and such. You hear it in films occasionally, when that cabling is under great stress, or whipping around.... that sound is something im after, to help me restrain/bind other entities.

Didnt really do anything today though, as per usual. In other news, I have a numb butt from all this sitting down. Culthrax finally got his cape a week ago, and The Underdogs lost their first fight vs the SSG Tricksters. We got robbed.  :/"

"event","Recently the days have reverted to being numb, devoid of individual detail. The ongoing numbness and mental evasion of my problems. Its all I can do for now, run. In heart and mind, I keep running until I can find a way to take a step forward. Nothing changes any more, but the pain is very real, and you cant reason with it.
In keeping with the tradition of admitting insecurities and weaknesses that I find, I submit this :
Nearly every degree of argueing distresses me deeply.
Even if other people argue, or shout, or become agressive, I become distressed. I was observing myself in a detached manner and managed to realise this. It explains why I seem to gravitate towards arguements that dont even involve me. Perhaps I try to play the peacekeeper/defender, because the sound of the arguement makes me feel terrified, makes me feel sick and hollow inside... or maybe I like to pretend that the person im defending is me... because I need a friend right now...
If only someone could understand these emotional problems. Sad and strange, that I desire that someone else to accept my problems. Why do I want other people to accept my problems? I think, because people criticise and tear apart what they dont agree with. They 'vulturise' what they see is stupid, or arrogant, or lazy, or just not what they are. This is the way of humankind. And I am very different from the average, in a normally very noticable way.
That is why I hide.
That is also why I painfully force myself to open up to people who show even a passing spark of true humanity or intelligence. Why do I do this? It feels like im deforming myself, pulling open my old wounds just to try get someone else to accept my problems, the real me.

I just want to feel safe again. It has been a long long time since I have felt safe. Its like I am disconnected from life itself. I am isolated. I dont think I want to 'join in' again, because I dont like this game any more. I dont like the others who play the game. They dont play fair.

And so the numbness shifted to internal struggles, roughly a week ago. Again, another turn of the carousel. I've been here before, but the invasive thoughts always penetrate all my defenses. The images force their way in, forcing me to live old scenes, forcing me to live scenes that never happened, ones that probably never will. I fooled myself into thinking it is ""preparation"" for the next time I am stabbed in the back, for the next time someone chooses to vent on the 'weak link'... the child wrapped up in a suit of armor...

I wonder what i'll use to survive this time? What excuse do I use now?
Again and again and again.. like a tune caught in my head..
I try not to post often, because otherwise all my posts would look like this. I know you get sick of seeing them, if you read them at all. There is no easy way. There never is. No sanctuary remains forever, and every ally will eventually sour into an assailant with knowledge on your weakest points. I cannot just get a little rest from all this. I cannot take a holiday from it, I cannot stand a brief respite before being forced back into living like this. A cure, or nothing at all.

3:48am. I'll be up for a long while before I sleep again.
Keep running. Never fall asleep, for the cure is always an inch away, the next hit of temporary release. Never wake up, because this world is just out to devour you piece by piece. Im sure you've seen that look in people before. Felt it in the worlds, the curling black actions that wind under the skin of everything. Like every single hardship is an army made from every foe you have faced before, once more.
Too stubborn to stop breathing, too fearful to try."

http://artpad.art.com/gallery/?ij6ykpzcvos

Took me ages, was just listening to music I downloaded from vgmix.com, mostly. I kept getting these weird draw-cursor faults, I would constantly have the 'text' cursor hovering over my paintbrush, obscuring the view... so eventually I gave in and didnt draw his black cargo pants and cape. Was going to add a floating barstool next to him surrounded in the gray/white aura too, and replace the bottom text with : ""Propel barstools for teh winz!!1""... but I got impatient, plus its nearly 7am.
I'd upload a picture of the Archelon as he looks in-game in City of Heroes, with that second costume of his, but I dont have anywhere to upload it to. Besides its too late/early to get a photoshack account, or whatever it was.

So, it seems I am not a complete waste of flesh after all.

"event","Heres a sad fact for you :
I only just noticed that the trees outside the house got their leaves back. Its almost July now.
I just remember looking at those naked trees one day, as winter had set in, trying to remember what they looked like with their shroud of leaves.

I need to look at the sky more often, and walk amongst trees a lot more.
The air is gorgeous around lots of trees, the smell of trees with cool air, especially when you're in woods or forests... it just really... I dont know. I've always loved the woods, being in the quiet away from people but in the company of grasslife and the towering bark-clad watchers. But its almost July now, and I only just noticed that the trees have their leaves back. Its sad, because I enjoy the cool air, beautiful skies and company of nature... and I never see them, because even sitting by a window without curtains is hard for me. I just got tired off the mocking, laughing looks of every passer by, the smirks. It only takes one smirk out of every 100 people to punish me for trying to open up to the world again, why am I so bloody sensitive? I cant shake these things from me, and I cant truly live if I accept all of these things..

Bah.
At least I know that in my heaven, or my ideal life, there will be cool air and LOTS of trees (and maybe lots of grasslife). Remembering that, which I already knew, was worth treading on what seems like eternally sore ground. How do I face my problems alone though? Is it possible to de-program this fear of people? Even if I were to solve my problems entirely, im sure that a firm knock would send me straight back to the bottom of my demons pit... and unfortuantely in this world, the knocks are plenty, even if they arent exactly hard.. they still land on tender flesh.

I think I need more music, new stuff to touch my spirit. Something has to change, and I guess if I can serve to get a little inspired or touched, it might help.
Still in a real haze with it all. Is it just fear holding me back?
I want to isolate myself from 99% of humankind, but I so desperately want someone to know me, the real me. Right now I feel confused, trying to decipher a practical solotion.

Maybe I just suffer from a terrible case of being a human being. All life is harsh and confusing, unstable, unpredictable and pretty nasty. Am I trying to force an ideal into my life that can never be? People seem to be genuinely happy at times, that seems like something I cant achieve... because im not strong enough to overlook the hardships. How do I learn the trick to living contently, when I always feel like the floor will give way under me at any moment? Even when things feel stable, I feel like I am lost in a self-generated black-hole. I finally pushed myself to go on the two videogames I bought on my birthday (4th of June), and although I can tell they are kinda good games, they just dont entertain me... would games like these have entertained me before this recent downhill slide? 

Feels like im trying to wake up from a coma, and the with the solution as easy as ""just wake up"", performing the cure isnt always easy. Thrashing against my problems still..
..I want to find my place in this world, and I hope it will be outside of this endless.. coma?

All my journal entries are the same again. Morbid. Confused. Alone.
No progress is made, and still I constantly feel there is something vital I need to get off my chest. What the fuck is it? I just need... someone... something... gaaaagh."

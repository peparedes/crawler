I'm so happy now.
I can't believe it.
I only breathe happiness right now.

I'll miss everyone.
I'll be gone for a week. &lt;3
Cruise!
Whoo! Mexico!
Loves and hugs! I'll get back on Friday/Saturday. :D"

Sometimes we don't understand our partner's requirements, or even our own. We all have a ""love tank"" that needs to be filled in order for us to express love to others, but there are different means by which our tank can be filled, and there are different ways that we can express love to others.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/breakout/lovelanguages.php' target='_blank'>Take the quiz</a>"

And then I'll stand over their dead body and say ""So it fucking goes, huh?""<br /><br />I don't know. I have no problem with the book and all, I've barely read it at all. But I have read some and I'd like to read more, but I would be so much more inclined to read it if people wouldn't continuously say ""So it goes."" I've heard it from at least ten people recently and I'm sick of hearing it.<br /><br />Jake was right - it's too apathetic.<br /><br />I think I'm uncomfortable with people claiming apathy or giving me an apathetic phrase all the time. Apathy comes off as being rude to me, for the most part, and is a stale emotion.. or lack of emotion. It's kinda of irritating for me, since I spend so much time <em>feeling</em>.</div>"

"event","So, I'm back! (I've been back since after school<em> yesterday</em>.. but I'm updating now.)<br /><br />And I know a lot of you missed me. Especially my beloved other half, Spazzums. Actually, she probably missed me the most.. have we ever parted during schooltime for that long? I don't think so. O_O SPAZ! *glomp* <br /><br />I missed you muchos. <br /><br />Actually, I was thinking of coming home the first night. I felt like utter shit. My head was throbbing because during the 45 minute cabin time we had, all my girls were screaming their heads off and fighting over the bunks and coming up to me to tell me a story I couldn't focus on because too many were coming at me. <br /><br />It was insanity tightly packed into a tiny cabin that had too much crap strewn about. <br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. <br /><br />Let's start at the beginning. <br /><br />The bus ride over wasn't that bad. We actually stopped to watch the Homeward Bound movie. I love that movie beyond comprehension. Actually, I haven't watched it very much recently, and I actually found myself wanting to cry when Sassy went over the waterfall and Shadow was giving up at the end. I love animals. ^_^ <br /><br />It was nice because I met another counselor - Dani. She is helluv nice. Mrs. Abramson was yelling at a kid named ""Thomas"" all during the ride there. Dani and I decided immediately he would be trouble. And we were right. At one point, Anya (another counselor) had told him to stop sitting up on the bus seats because it would hurt him. He wouldn't listen and she kept asking. I was the one who stepped in and told him to sit down. Then the little jerk sticks his tongue out at me and keeps doing it. I got so irritated because at that point, I was puppet to the rampaging blood monster of femininity - I said to him: ""Thomas! Sit down in your seat or you're going to receive a check immeditately. Don't think I'm kidding."" I had said it in such an... adult voice I scared myself.. it was like.. @_@;;; <br /><br />He sat down.. and <em>stayed</em> there. <br /><br />Anyway, back to the story. We got there and things were nice and fine. We met our councelor coordinator, Cocoon. All the naturalists/coordinators/staff had nature names. Real names too, except for Tree Hugger.. who was named that at birth. <br />We met our kids and went to our cabins way later in the day, before dinner. <br /><br />By the time dinner rolled around, I was so sick to my stomach. I was actually homesick, already. I felt sick to my stomach, I was hungry but didn't want to eat, and my head was throbbing thanks to my little gaggle of girls. I had some water and I took a sinus benedryl before bed. <br /><br />It was my friend. <br /><br />During the kids' rec time, I was watching the girls bathroom and the Zen Garden. Since no one was taking showers on the first day because it wasn't really allowed, I chilled in the Zen Garden. I got a couple of kids (who otherwise would be going off the wall nuts) to calm down and work with me to make patterns in the sand. <br /><br />They were asking me things about Zen Gardens and it was great. <br /><br />I want a Zen garden of my own.&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Actually.."">Actually, I'm redoing my room to have a Zen feel to it. Brown, off-white, and green color theme. Brown furniture and whatnot. I'm getting rid of my television in my room because I don't want it to ruin the feel of my bedroom. And I think I'm going to get either a Bonsai tree or a small Zen garden to put somewhere next to my bed on a nightstand.&nbsp;<br /><br />It'd be da shiz.&nbsp;</div><br />Anyhoo! <br /><br />Then we did the night hike and when it was time for the kids to walk by themselves in the woods, only 50ft, they were freaking out. All my girls did it, even though they were scared. I had given them each a hug before they did it because they were so scared. It made them feel better and I was so proud so I gave them an ACT award. <br /><br />(Attitude, Cooporation, Take a Chance = ACT.) <br /><br />Things got better from then on. We went to Big Basin State Park, which was helluv awesome too. All the redwood trees were kick ass. They were huge.&nbsp;But the hills were murder on my knees. *cries*<br /><br />My group and Anya's group = Byrd Baylor Group. She had boys and I had girls. <br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">We only had girl councelors. The one guy who was going chickened out a week before. *shrug* And origionally I had been placed with a boys cabin, which would've been cool except for.. the me needing to change and whatnot. <br />I would've done it, but it had ended up being my PMSy week so I didn't want to have to explain to them when I took a pad or tampon out, that I was on my period. My girls asked me that at one point when they saw, but they understood immediately. <br />I don't know if 5th grade boys would understand. </div><br />Anyway, our groups got along alright.. when the councelors were there. When we got back to the cabin, all they could talk about were the boys or how a boy could come over to the girls' village and watch them change. I thought that was laughable, considering they'd be too short to see through the windows.&nbsp;<br /><br />Haha.<br /><br />At the 5th grade level, girls don't really have anything.. <em>I</em> should've been more worried about one of the boys seeing me!<br /><br />The boys didn't seem to like Anya.. but they really liked me.. Grant liked to hug Anya and all the other boys really liked talking to me and being around me. Some boys I had never actually met even knew who I was. One of them had said my name and took my picture when I turned around. I was like ""Wth? Who are you?"" But yeah. The kids had adorable moments. <br /><br />We had skit night, which was fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />I hate the Banana Slug Song.&nbsp;<br /><br />It's stuck in my head. <br /><br /><div class=""ljcut""><strong>Awards we Won:</strong> <br />2 Earth Awards (the most out of everyone there) <br />2 On Time Awards <br />2 Lights Out Awards <br />2 ACT Awards <br />1 Golden Dust pan&nbsp;</div><br />We rocked out loud.&nbsp;<br /><br />But yeah.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm glad to be home now. I don't actually have to wear my immobilizer brace anymore! Yay! And my knees are feeling great now because I got in the Jacuzzi! ^_^<br /><br />I've decided to grow my hair out and get red highlights too.<br /><br />So, did any one <em>else </em>miss me?<br /><br /><strong>My Highlight for Today:</strong> Adrian and Jake came to see me just a while ago. I felt special."

"event","I probably won't update when I get back from So-Cal on Sunday.

Or on Monday while I'm still here.

So I did stay home today. I had felt sick to my stomach and my head was throbbing. I know the reason behind this, but I'd rather not explain it on here anyway. No, I don't want people asking me about it either. I'll be back at school tomorrow since I have to check up with homework and shiz while I'm there.

Today I had to go to the MIC. Oh yay. I went there and they checked out my knee.. So here is where my heart breaks. The man tells me I can't run.. for about... a month.. As in, I will not be doing XC for the next month.. I'm not quitting, I'm just injured apparently so I can't do any running.&nbsp;I'll still go to races and cheer them on and such, but I will not be running. *cries*

My heart has shattered.

Now I'm wearing an immobilizer brace.

Which I call: THE IMMOBILIZOR!

I walk weird in it. *grr*

I've decided to carry a notepad with me everywhere now.. Just in case I get some extra time I'll sit down and write for WOC. I'm going to write to Memaw Margaret and ask her if she can edit my story along the way because she's probably the one person I really trust with that type of thing on a professional rough-draft basis. Considering she has more experience in the field of publishing than anyone else I know.. ^_^;;;

I'm just afraid it might be too ""adult"" for her to handle her granddaughter writing.. O_O;;;

I'm leaving tomorrow at 5:30-6 for So-Cal.

I can't wait.

I need to upload more music to my MP3. I think I'll put some of Eric's music on there too because I already had some on there, but I think it'd be nice to listen fully to it all. To be honest, a lot of it reminds me of things I thought of for WOC. Haha, if it ever becomes a movie, he can be Danny Elfman to my Tim Burton. Hahahaha...

*insane*

Oh yeah.. I threw up today.

Mara/Kelsey - Sorry but no bandy fandy yet. I've been feelin' so messed up today that there was no point of writing anything good.. for it.. So, I'll try to get you some soon. Don't worry. Te amo muchos."

"event","For the next week I shall be: BUSY. <br /><br />It's crazy. <br /><br />We have a race against Campo (who're going DOWN, right XC?!) but I won't be racing tomorrow. *le sigh* I think I'll go anyway to support my teammates. I loves my teammates. I can't run because my knee is still fucked from the first race at Newhall (which is the park the race is at tomorrow) but I honestly don't think it'll be so bad that I'll have to stop running completely. <br /><br />It's not that I can't stand running or I get tired. Because I don't anymore, to be honest. I love running. It's so much fun. I may not run fast, but I can keep going and going because it's great. The thing right now is that my knees are fucked up and I don't think that's any reason for me to stop running. I'm going to see a doctor about them soon. Hopefully before I go to Outdoor Ed (which I'll talk about later in this entry.)&nbsp;<br /><br />Eric said that he could keep running and running..&nbsp;<br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"">Which I thought about later and I've decided that he would not. Eric, if you're reading this.. no you could not. I'm sure you can run like regular personal running, but XC shiz is definately not for you. I think you'd kill yourself just because of how skinny you are.. I seriously doubt you could get enough oxygen to your lungs to keep yourself going. <br /><br />So Eric.. within XC.. <br /><br />You would be the weakest link. <br /><br />*goodbye* ^_^ <br /></div>
<br />Races suck though because you know you have to beat people. So you have to go fast and stuff.. Which don't get me wrong is fun to beat people, but I feel so bad about myself even though I've just started.. I'm getting better so no worries, really.<br /><br />Anyhoo, for tomorrow's race I'm going. I may not be running, but I'll bring water and stuff for people. Ryan is getting a chocolate muffin tomorrow because I promised him one when we were going to the Y. Oh, and Ryan? While you were leaving some staff guy was saying ""Ryan? Oh.. well.. I needed his work permit."" Yeah. So you might want to get that into him.. eventually...<br /><br />But yeah!<br /><br />I think I should get a job at the Y afterall..&nbsp;<br /><br />I could work with Ryan!&nbsp;<br /><br />If I even get the job.<br /><br />I need a goddamn application again.<br /><br />This weekend I'm going to Southern California. Yes, that's right. AGAIN. I go there just about as much as Eric used to constantly go to Sea Ranch. Not that he's not still going, I think.. he just hasn't told me recently if he's going anywhere. So yeah! I'll be gone over the weekend starting right after XC practice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Like RIGHT after.<br /><br />Then goes the whole five hour drive down there. Mom's going with me this time so yay! All the mom's and daughters will be visiting Papaw! I love seeing Papaw too. I miss him an awful lot though.. I didn't get to see much of him when he came down here a couple weeks ago. So to SO CAL WE GO! Whoo hoo!<br /><br />And swimming! LOTS of swimming!!!<br /><br />TAN LINES!<br /><br />I think while I'm down there I'll try and do some XC warm-up things.. Like what we do when we get in the line and run through in threes and we talk about the size of Adrian's penis and Ronnie makes crude jokes about him being Mexican. Haha, I love XC. I think I want to because I won't have time to do it the following week.<br /><br />Which I'm going into next. Technically for the rest of this week and Monday of next week is the only time any of you will see me. I'm leaving for So Cal on Friday, I won't be back until Sunday (probably too late to do anything with anyone so lo siento) and then I'm going to have Monday where I'm at school collecting shiz from teachers just to be sure. Then I'm going to be going to Outdoor Ed Tuesday-Friday. I won't be back&nbsp;early enough&nbsp;on Friday to see any of you. Then I'm spending that weekend in seclusion from the world as I make up homework papers I missed to turn in because I was gone and whatnot. As in, I have a weekend in So Cal, 1-day break, four days of Outdoor Ed, and then two days of homework.<br /><br />I shall be wiped. ^_^"

"event","*emerges from a six and a half hour sleep* <br /><br />God, I wake up at... eleven.. I had fallen asleep after Adrian called at four. Luckily I did put the effort into moving into the guest bedroom. I swear I <em><strong>love </strong></em>that bed. Dad took me to Wendy's because we're hungry and apparently we have no food in this house worth eating at an hour before midnight. So now I'm updating having eaten my spicy chicken sammich but yeah. <br /><br />Today's race was great actually. I really enjoy the gathering of XC cultists all in one place because it's just so.. nice. Not once today did I feel sick when someone got too close to me. My no-touchy-policy doesn't apply to people who like running apparently. It was a nice gathering though. <br /><br />The bathrooms were horribly crowded so Adrian and I headed over to my Aunt's house to use that bathroom. Krisi was talking to me while Adrian was in the bathroom and she told me that when I'm eighteen I can move in with her and NOT be with my parents. <br /><br /><center><strong><font size=""5""><font color=""#ff0000"">YES</font> <font color=""#ff0000"">F</font><font color=""#ff6600"">U</font><font color=""#ffff00"">C</font><font color=""#99cc00"">K</font><font color=""#3366ff"">I</font><font color=""#333399"">N</font><font color=""#800080"">G</font> <font color=""#00ff00"">GOD</font> <font color=""#ff00ff""><em>YES</em>!</font></font></strong></center><br /><br />Krisi asked Morgan whether or not she'd be fine with me moving in with her mom and Morgan is cool with it. She understands because of how irritating my parentals are to me. I am <em>so</em> happy. So excited for that because only two-three months into Senior year, I can move in with her! <font color=""#99cc00""><font size=""3"">OH.</font> <font size=""4"">EM.</font> <font size=""5"">GEE.</font></font> Of course, this will cause conflict in the family, but I really don't care. I have a place to go when I'm 18! I don't have to be here any longer than I promised my mom! <br /><br /><em>""Two more years."" <br /><br />""Well, you still have college, so you'll have to stay with us.""</em> <br /><br /><center><strong><font size=""5""><font color=""#ffcc99"">NO</font><em> <font color=""#ff0000"">F</font><font color=""#ff6600"">U</font><font color=""#ffff00"">C</font><font color=""#99cc00"">K</font><font color=""#3366ff"">I</font><font color=""#333399"">N</font><font color=""#800080"">G</font> <font color=""#cc99ff"">WAY</font></em> <font color=""#ffcc99"">NOW!</font></font></strong></center><br /><br />YES! <br /><br />You guys don't know how happy that makes me.<br /><br />Anyway, so we ran two miles. My time was 21:01. It's really not that bad for my first time, I've decided. Not only that but I didn't stop. I kept going. I slowed down back up the hill but I still did good. So be proud of me. BE proud. Mom was so proud."

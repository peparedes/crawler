"event","this is fucking bullshit. i dont get to see my friends just cause my mom doesnt work. bullshit. fucking bullshit. fucking depressed out of my mind and i cant even try to be happy cause everytime i do these people always find a way to jsut shoot me back down. i feel so fucking lonely and they dont even let me see the people who make me feel like im not. i dont get to see the only people who fill the fucking empty ass void in my heart. every time i try to, these fucking people just tear it to fucking peices. then they see me crying, and they see how much it hurts to be alone, and not even then do they let me go. im just stuck i here all day every day. loveless. without a kiss, without a hug, without a fucking life. and then whenever i talk about it im told to stop complaining. then they rub in my face that when that at least were not with my dad that i dont have to put up with physical abuse. i wish they would fucking punch me. i want the physical abuse. i cant stand their words, they kill me. every letter said is a stab to the chest. a kick to the broken rib. fucking awesome now the tears dont stop rolling down and staining the face."

"event","i saw the two most beautiful things today. broccolli and the fullest moon in a long time. idk i look at gilrs like that, the most beautiful that if you see on the street you think theyre models, and i dont believe that i know them. i seriously dont believe myself. i converse and interact with these chicks that are my dreamgirls and then im like wow howd that happen. and the whole time im acting like a retarded dumbass. all shaky and nervous trying to look at the ground and not at precious eyes. man i dont even know. then i just saw the full moon right now. i used to keep like a calendar at my desk and keep track of it so i could go to my window and stare at it at night. fall asleep staring at teh moon. the one thing that brings light into the night. the one thing that keeps me from being afraid of the dark. idk why i havent been with my moon. maybe cause its on the other side of the house and not on the side where my rooms stuck. fucking tracy i hate it here. i wish i lived in san leandro where i could ride my scooter to the bart station and everything was so easy to get to. i dont have any fucking friends here in shitty ass tracy. fucking hate this shit. if were still here in two years, my ass is out as soon as i turn the big 1-8. fuck this."

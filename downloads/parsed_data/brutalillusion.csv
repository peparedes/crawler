I'm almost at my goal for the day of 5000 words; ten percent of the way to being complete. It's surprising that I still like the story as much as when I started it, but I'm going to treat it like my animation pieces so only tiny tidbits will be seen before it's finished.

I called this morning saying that they would be in my thoughts and that I wished everything go smoothly. Apparently, the surgery was early this morning (I had assumed it was later) and they did not receive my message until they got home. I feel bad for not being there with her, and bad for not thinking of her at the time it happened either. Not being there in reality or spirit is incredibly taxing at times.

So for feeling down on myself all day, I felt highly productive.

I just slouch down to rest my head after the first hour has passed and I realize that there's still two hours left in the room. It's not as if I really fall asleep, but it probably looks like I'm totally out of it, and I feel bad for the teacher because it's a good class.

If I could force myself to sleep earlier, I would. Though it seems that watching movies, playing games, and creating D&D figures and grids for the game I'm DMing are all more worthwhile than sleeping at this time of night."

I prepared bags of Friendship Bread dough to give away as party favors and hand decorated little recipe sheets with three different variations. After throwing off my apron and tossing on my futuristic-blending-in-with-aliens outfit, I danced for a while and joined in on a spontaneous can-can. There was homework to do for the next morning, so I retired from the festivities and went to my room to read.
I woke up several hours later, went to class, and then waited to get picked up for a ride from my housemates. We ventured off to the Museum of Holography and became mesmerized by the glorious functions of light imagery. After getting back to the house, I went to the park and visited some cute sheep and goats and the little petting zoo. Finally, the night completed with a geeky game of D&D.
Today, I decided to dress up. Went to the book sale. Worked on a puzzle. Did some homework. Made baklava and told everyone that tonight's dinner is formal. So we will feast on falafel, melons, and a green bean salad looking fancy at the ping pong dinner table.

and missing the free screening of Darjeeling was worth it, because I made my first hologram in class that night and got to keep it."

I had made a plan with my regular Sunday night bus driver last week to trade goods. I was going to bring raspberries from my house, and she would bring cherries from her yard. Now, the two of us have become friends through the hours that she has driven me around town. She used to run the 43/44 route on my way home from the NWFF Saturday evenings, and now she drives Sunday nights on my way home from the Metro. We talk about our families and general lives, and I feel as if she is sort of an honorary aunt.
The staff was taking a little too long to clean up at the end of the night, so after my running and jumping around they let me leave a few minutes early to catch my bus. I barely caught it, got on, and was surprised to see a man behind the wheel.
""Are those raspberries?"" he asked with a smile.
I said yes, with a slight tone of sadness.
""Taking them home to make jam or something? I love jam."" He had a very cheery attitude, and I couldn't help but warm up to him.
""I made jam last week actually. These were going to be for the driver who regulary does this route. We made a deal that I would give her raspberries and she would bring me cherries,"" I replied.
The driver reached behind his chair, pulled out a plastic bag and handed it to me. It was full of cherries. I couldn't believe that he had the exact thing that I had planned to trade with someone else, and I gave him my berries. He was thrilled to swap goods with me (and didn't seem to expect I was going to trade, but was willing to just give me his fruit) and was incredibly excited about getting some raspberries, and even more happy to learn that they were home-grown."

There are, of course, many kinds of bias.  Some of the more common kinds are those against race, religion,

"event","I'm unbelievably pleased to find out that one of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_jhdZoPW1Q&mode=related&search="">my favorite bands</a> is from Norway. 
This will make for a much more fun presentation on the Scandinavian heritage. I would love to talk to someone about the music scene in those countries. Iceland, Norway, Finland... each country's music has a unique sound that I admire. I don't know much about modern Danish and Swedish music, but if you do let me know."

"event","Okay. It's over. 
My interview is done
they'll judge me from that 25 minute run
question and answer from generalized queries
I stuttered through my personal theories
how I'm a leader
who I've encouraged
what's important
how I have flourished
I don't want another disappointment
a ""thank you but no"" letter sent
Single but gay
I pray to deserve a scholarship from the GSBA

Decisions today,
perhaps already,
I just have to hold my head up steady
wait nervously and try to rest
hope that it was my best.
When they let me know may be soon to you all
but for me it seems already like fall."

"event","It's strange to have this many people to see in such a compacted amount of time. It seems that usually I would get together with a friend maybe once or twice a month. Yesterday Anna and I saw a movie. Today Alison came over to have a cooking party, play croquet, and play Clue. Then I went to have dinner with Hilary, and afterward we swing danced and wandered the UW campus.

Tomorrow is my interview and I'm worried.
What if I don't get any scholarships for college? I want to make it as easy on my parents as possible. I don't want loans. It feels bad to say no to a school that offered me 12,000 a year to go to the one I really want, even though they aren't providing me with any financial aid. I hate money."

If I don't, I will feel as if I have missed out on a good free movie.

Working at a movie theater really dulls the excitement of going out to see one. Or perhaps I'm just too worn out tonight.

Hot Fuzz can wait. I can wait. I already saw about half an hour of it anyway."

I worked on getting paid for my animation job.
I sent in my official entry to the Seattle Times.
I decided that I want to enter the  Futurewave Film Contest tomorrow with Gloveless.
I had a City of God hugfest
and tasted cereals (one of which I hated, two which were chai dusted and delicious)
I got my official letter from Columbia, and I'll be leaving in July it seems.
I thought more about this summer, what I want to do. I could go to Croatia with my family, but the idea of a trip by myself or with friends intrigues me. I've got money from savings to spend on a trip, but don't know what to do.

I enter contests because I see no harm in it. If there is a chance of me winning, why not? All of the cruel pranks that Life has thrown at me recently have to equal out with joy. One of the contests might be that needed weight on the balancing scale. How else would I know?"

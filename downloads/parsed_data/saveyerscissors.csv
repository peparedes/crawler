"event","<p>This is being posted for a number of reasons, one reason being that i would like to tell people that, whether you like it or not, there is a difference between a black person and a ""nigger"", yes I said it.&nbsp; A nigger can be black or white. The word ""wigger""&nbsp;means ""white nigger"" and isn't needed.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was created by a person with&nbsp;a very small mind. Eminem is white, and he is just as much of a ""nigger"" as 50 cent, who is black. Nigger is not a nice word, and it shouldn't be used, but if you're going to use it, use it the right way. Don't go around looking at every black person thinking ""Look at that&nbsp;nigger"" its not right. At all. A black person, a white person, a mexican, or any race can be a nigger. </p><p><font size=""5"">SKIN COLOR MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.</font></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>As far as&nbsp;stereotypes go, Lets be honest. Black people are stereotypically known as thieves, or bad people/niggers. That's not true. Not every black person will steal your car, or snatch your purse. A thief&nbsp;will steal your car or snatch your purse. Not every white person hates black people. No race is smarter than another. Not all black people are the theives.&nbsp; Not all arabs are suicide bombers. Not all asians are strict. Not all white people are racist. Not all mexicans are drug dealers. Not all americans are ignorant. Not all jews are rich. And so on. Some people are good and some are bad, regardless of looks, or race. </p><p><font size=""5"">PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE</font>.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>For those of you who walk around with your boxers showing saying ""Whaddup nigga"", your style has been brought to you, courtesy of jails and prisons. Some criminals like Eminem, Tupac, and 50 cent stereotype themselves and dress or act a certain way. Since they're famous people think they're cool, so they copy them,&nbsp;by dressing and talking&nbsp;the same&nbsp;way. It just makes you look like a criminal. Which is generally what most people who dress that way want everyone to think. They use it as a cover-up to look tough. It makes people&nbsp;think a certain way about themselves when theyre stereotyped. For example, my mom was teaching a black boy about Africa, and there is a place in Africa called Niger. NOT nigger. And the boy looked at it and said ""Whats that say?"" my mom said ""That says Niger"" he told her&nbsp;""Ahaha no, say it the OTHER way"" she replied saying no I won't say that word. The boy said ""Ha, yeah well thats what&nbsp;I am I'm a NIGER."" He thought that because he was black he was&nbsp;a nigger. That isn't true. So, think before you&nbsp;speak and act. Think to yourself&nbsp;, do&nbsp;I really want to live up to this stereotype? Don't follow in the foot steps of criminals. Be yourself, you don't have to sag your&nbsp;pants and disrespect&nbsp;people.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all honestly, we all can make stereotypical jokes and stereotypes can be humerous. But it all boils down to truth. Some people live up to their stereotypes and thats when they aren't funny anymore. </p><p><font size=""5"">DONT STEREOTYPE YOURSELF.</font></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>All I'm trying to say is that a person is a person, don't just look at them and make a decision based on how they look. I've met&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of different people. Fat, skinny, tattooed, pierced, black, white, mixed, rich, poor, etc. and in all those different kinds of people I've met some of the best people I've ever spoken with, and some of the worst. Its all about getting to know who they are.</p><p>&nbsp;<font size=""5"">DONT JUDGE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU KNOW THEM.</font></p>"

"event","<p>i wish i could fly. i would fly far far far away from 2007 and everyone in it. i would take some people with me. we would go to a place where there is nothing to worry about. i would fly so high that nothing mattered anymore. not the past not the future-just the present. i want to give everything to the world but i want to take so much at the same time. i wish i could do or say something so powerful that the world around me would change. but i dont have that power. i wish i could jump off of a ttall building and just keep falling and falling. but once i reached the ground i wouldnt die. i would just swoop up like a bird and everything would be fine. sort of like spinning in circles. if you just spin and spin and spin until everything is blurry then you dont know whats going on around you and nothing really concerns you anymore. if you close your eyes you can imagine that youre spinning right off the ground and you feel like anything is possible. and once you stop spinning you just fall to the earth and stare up at the spiraling sky. everything just sort of looks like it was thrown into a blender. and for that brief moment all you&nbsp;can think about is the dizziness inside of you that causes your thoughts to wirl. until everything comes back into focus and youre back in reality.&nbsp; its such a rush, it just makes everything better. but you have to think of it as an escape-not just a silly waste of time. flying isnt as far out of reach as you think.</p>"

"event","typical adjectives to describe a certain portion middle school girls, that youd be most likely to find at a catholic&nbsp;school or in the richest areas in your neighborhood&nbsp;would be <br />-catty<br />-attention-caraving<br />-dramatic<br />-immature<br />-selfish<br />-foolish<br /><br />but thats not true for <em>all </em>of them. however ive witnessed a bunch of air-headed girls going around and saying phrases like ""o.m.g. youre like my BFF!"" and then they go behind your back and say things like ""ew ehmagawd&nbsp;['BFF' name here] is so totally annoying <em>ugh. </em>i dont even know why im friends with them!"" and who ever they say <em>that </em>to would repeat it and everything would fall apart for about the amount of time it takes a ditzy shit-talking girl to type ""o.m.g. i totally did <em>NAWT </em>say that!"" into her hot-pink Razr callphone. and then everything would be okay. or they would continue the fight using corny unnecessary lines that they purposely say in order to sound more hurt than they actually are. such as ""WOW i mean i cant believe i trusted you.GOD.how <em>could </em>you?! youre such a bad friend! what did i do to deserve this? all i ever was was nice to you and now this is how you repay me?"" but on most ocassions there would be a bit more foul language and name-calling. common words that girls like this&nbsp;would choose are<br />-whore<br />-skank<br />-bitch<br />-slut<br />-dyke<br />-""fat""<br />-ugly<br />-fake<br />-liar<br />-attention-whore<br />etc.<br /><br />i try to stay away from girls like this, but unfortunately most of them come in Dior perfume-scented packages of manipulation and fake kindness. which makes them hard to spot. and it doesnt help that even if you <em>can </em>spot them they all stick together and they all lie so you never know who is telling the truth. and even if you know that theyre lying, they will always stand up for eachother and make sure that you dont sabotage them. what they dont realize is that they are standing up for the same girl who called them a ""fake slut"" just the other day which im sure they wouldnt be particularly pleased to hear. but the fact is that they are nearly impossible to stop and i advise that you&nbsp;just keep your thoughts to yourself and ignore them. if they talk about you as well and make up rumors you can still ignore them. because no matter what they come up with, if anyone ever confronts you about it you can back yourself up and they just look stupid. the best thing to do is ignore them and if it gets out of hand stand up for yourself and dont be afraid of them because it all boils down to insecurities and a lie of a lifestyle. you are better than they are, and if you show them that they have no control over you, then you can beat them. just be nice to who ever is nice to you and confront who ever is not. dont make up rumors, dont talk about people when they arent present. just be honest and stop listening to <em>mean girls.</em><br />"

"event","<p>the majority of them-that ive met-have secretive family issues that no one talks about to mantain a ""perfect"" life style, or obviously just because its no one else's bussiness.&nbsp;most people in the detroit area think of grosse pointe as the home of the rich snobs, and most people believe that they live perfect happy lives. but yet, i know of five young people in the area that have committed suicide-i didnt know any of them personally. most of them have parents who drink frequently and are rarely around or aware of what their children are doing. all families have flaws, but some families are better at concealing them. but then there are also the families who are just happy, and have a few problems-nothing out of the ordinary-and a few cars-most of which are just huge gas-eaters that are better to be looked at than used-a large house, or a home that is small but expensively decorated-real leather couches, big-screen televisions, real marble floors, hot-tubs, surround-sound systems, etc.-sons and daughters fully clothed in brand names-Abercrombie, Hollister, Gucci, Prada, Lacoste, Louis Vuitton, etc.-and most of them are also fully equppied with the lastest gadgets-iPhones, Side-Kicks, NV cellphones, Razrs, etc.-and so on and so forth. in a grosse pointe private school i encountered many people who are mostly similar to those discriptions, and they dont care who you are they just care what you own. they ask questions like ""is that <em>real?</em>"" but i bet they wouldnt think twice about whether or not their <em>friend</em> was real, as long as they would borrow their ""BFF's"" Dolce &amp; Gabana dress. but i live in harper woods where people are just people-and i like it that way. a vast majority of my friends live in grosse pointe but contrary to belief, some of them have large problems to deal with, and they aren't all completely spoiled-or atleast they dont show it-and i enjoy being around them. in case youre wondering this journal is being posted just to prove that even though you live in a huge expensive house with an in-ground pool and a bay window, you could still have a drug addict mother, or a suicidal sibling. it doesnt matter what you own, a person is a person.</p>"

"event","i guess you could say ive ""figured it all out."" im not sure what happend, but for a while i just wasnt feeling any emotion and i wanted to cry laugh and scream all at the same time. but ive abandoned my empty feelings and im now living normally again! haha. i have widened my horizon of people and i now feel better. i had a huge birthday party and everyone-except 4 people-came that i invited. [which was alot] and since then i have been getting alot more calls and doing more with my life. i dont sit home anymore or just go to the same places over and over. ive moved on. and ive sorted out what i see in my friends and why i am attracted to them and if there is anything to be attracted <em>to.</em> aaaaaaand ive realized the flaws of their personalities and i understand everything alot more. im just far more content with my life. there are still a few pieces that need to fall in place but it will be that way for the rest of my life. and i can accept that."

"event","okay guys, so i figured out our budget for prom. it's contingent on 10 people going with us....

1. Limo- $20

2. Hotel- I thought it was best to stay at the Bonaventure(where prom actually is) it'll save us limo money and its not an expensive hotel at all. $28

3. Alcohol-Taking donations of $10-$20. If you plan on drinking, give up some cash. We can get whatever you want, just request it. Donate accordingly =)



Total: $58-$68. I need the money ASAP kids so I can reserve the hotel and limo. Or else, we'll be walking and sleeping on the streets like hobos...but at least we'll have our alcohol."

"event","most teenage girls spend their friday nights getting drunk, having sex, generally just having a good time. i spend mine with fictious characters in a neighborhood i created. My Sims. Named and modeled after me and my (now ex) boyfriend. i guess it's the only way i feel i can get him to do what i want. the only way i can get him to spend time with me. the only way...
our relationship sucks to be completly honest. everyday is a new struggle. a new battle. a new fight. actually, it's not new at all. it's always the same. tanya. not paying me attention. the only thing that changes is the lighting. 
it's gotten to be unbearable. he loves me (or so he says) so why is it so hard to get him to wanna see me. spending time with him feels like pulling teeth sometime. hes drifting further away with each passing moment. back to his friends. 
i dont know what his friends do for him that i can not. 
i can understand when he needs to work on his movie. i can understand when he needs to work on his college things. i can understand that he's kind of dorky. i can understand that his clothes sometimes don't match (khaki and khaki...=(). i can understand that he can not perform oral on me. i can understand that sometimes his equipment just doesnt work. what i can't understand is why he just can not distance himself from his friends and spend more time with me. or why (it seems) like half the time we have plans he wiggles his way out of them to spend time with his friends. 
i cant understand why he makes me feel this way. i guess its because hes possibly the only guy that has ever made me feel this way. it's a can't eat, can't sleep kinda thing. and its heart breaking. 
and to think.... i wanted us to consider a long distance relationship in college. haha. silly me. things dont work now...why the hell would they work then.

i love him. but i absolutly hate his character."

so on friday i stayed from school because um...i had to get ready for friday night. because, friday night i went camping. or at least thats what my mom thinks. in actuality i spent the night with brad. <333. he picked me up from school at 4. we went back to his house where he did the most romantic thing ever. he laid a trial of rose petals from his front door to a table that had pictures of us and a disposable camera to take more pics of us. then the trail went to his bedroom and his bed was covered with petals. and there were candles. and i fell in love with him all over again. i spent the night. fell asleep with him. woke up with him. a girl could really get used to it....too bad it expires in 9 months.

on the bright side, i got introduced to all of the adults as brad's girlfriend. it was amazing. and now our relationship is official because not only are there pictures of us, but there are pictures of us with his mom. =). (p.s. brad, i want copies)

i got driven home in a limo (omg) and had like 20387482347 pictures taken of me and brad (by the pseudo paparazzi). we are such the celebrity power couple. lol. 

i love brad. seriously.

oh, brad sincerly asked me to homecoming. and i accepted. aint that exciting? but i really want to go with my friends. i just know that it wont be that good of a time if i dont go with them. p.s. gerald should come. 

well, im done. i just wanted everyone to know how miserable i was after having to hang out with his friends. this will probably end up causing some sort of drama.... so ill just be honest and say that there were actually only 2 people who i didnt like and that made me feel kinda weird. but its just easier to blame in on the lot.

dear tanya, 
id really appreciate it if you stop being a cunt. telling your ap euro class that im a big whore just because brad couldnt take you home is unneccesary and incredibly uncalled for. and going and asking kris if im mad with you, when you know youre talking shit, is just flat out stupid.
I don't know what your problem with me is. My problem with you is the way you talk to people (newsflash youre not better than ANYONE) and the fact that you felt the need to ""warn"" brad about me. If brad should be warned about anyone, its you. youre the one who manipulates him and made him your bitch. but now that he's not at your every beck and call, you feel the need to label me a whore.
i sincerly care about brad (not that i have to explain it to you). so, maybe you should keep yourself out of this one.

if anyones the whore, itd probably be you seeing as your the one who takes it in the ass. =)

"event","my mom grounded me for being a minute late. i have to come home at 10 tomorrow.

but that really doesnt matter because im not going out. brad will be with his friends and since i have none i will be home.

im going to make the fact that i have no friends into something useful. 

Focus on bcc. Read more books. Volunteer. Write. Things that will matter in 10 years when I've forgotten about all of you. 

I'm probably gonna stop writing in here anyway. g'night."

"event","i think people used to like to hang out with me. before i was mean, self centered, and vain. back when i was nice.

people used to call me to hang out. now they call him.

i used to be happy. but lately, not so much.

maybe he was right, maybe i dont treat people right.

maybe we shouldnt have made things real if nothings different. 

theres things going on in my head that im not so sure about.

i want a movie to make me famous and i wanna be the girl all the guys want to take to prom. just so i can turn them all down because im not going. 

prom's gay.

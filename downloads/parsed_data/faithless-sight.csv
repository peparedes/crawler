Independent and dominant, you tend to be the alpha dog in most situations.
You're very confident, and hardly anything ever shakes you.
Mundane tasks tend to drain you - you prefer to be making great plans.
You are quite original. When people don't ""get"" you, it bothers you a lot.

Your strength: Your ability to gain respect

Your weakness: Caring too much what others think

Your power color: Orange-red

Your power symbol: Letter X

Your power month: October</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatdoesyourbirthdatemeanquiz/"">What Does Your Birth Date Mean?</a></div>"

"event","so this song made me weep a great deal. of sadness and was greatly jealous that i myself didn't write it.


Complete and total adoration,
My gift to you, my heart was yours,
In ten weeks you shaped it, 
In one night you murdered it.
Torn from my chest and laid at your feet,
That first step that you took was the worst.
Since then you've walked a thousand miles in solace and short remark,
And I still have these memories,
But will never see what we could have been.
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
<b>Remember, cause that's all you can do.
We'll never make another memory,
We'll never make another memory.</b>
I wish I would have died in your arms the last time we were together,
So I wouldn't have to wake without you today.
This time I thought things were real,
You said they were,
What happened?
You were a priority, 
<i>Was I an option?</i>
I let you see a side of me that I don't share with anyone.
Promises are just words unless they are fulfilled.
Knew from the beginning all I had to offer you was my heart,
I'm just sorry that it wasn't enough.
So, we'll go our own ways,
And hopefully you'll remember these things I've told you,
Hopefully you'll understand that everything I said is in sincerity.
A broken heart is not what I wanted from this,
But I guess I've learned from it.
But aren't you supposed to learn from your <underline>mistakes?</underline>
I don't consider this a mistake,
I just wish the story didn't end this way,
Cause I'm still in love with the person who helped me write it.
Remember when you held my hand like you'd never let it go?
Remember when we talked about where we'd be a year from now?

"event","what an awesome day to stay home sick. its purely disgraceful outside. i slept til almost one because hey what else have i got to do? i feel like crap. i can't breathe and surely my voice will leave me shortly but im holding onto it as long as possible. i kind of wish i went to school today cuz we had a review day is stat and well stat= hell so i need all the help i can get, although i don't really care if i pass anymore. but if i had gone i wouldnt have listened cuz well i never do. no matter how hard i try to make myself. i had to eat little kid cereal this morning cuz i finished off my box so i ate sugar for breakfast. it was very disgusting. like this stupid song im listening to. it sucks terribly. thats what ive been doing all day. looking up music because im tired of all mine. but i cant find anything decent whatsoever. well i think im going to go take a bath, see if the hot water slash steam will unstuff my nose and then go back to bed."

"event","How does it feel to know you're everything I need 
The butterflies in my stomach 
they could bring me to my knees 
How does it feel to know you're everything I want 
I've got a hard time saying this 
so I'll sing it in a song 

Oh I adore the way you carry yourself 
With the grace of a thousand angels overhead 
I love the way the galaxy starts to melt 
When we become one 
When we become one 
When we become one 
When we become one 

How does it feel 
How does it feel when we get locked into a stare? 
Please don't come looking for me 
when I get lost in the mess of your hair 
How do you feel when everything you've known 
gets thrown aside 
Never fear, my dear, 'cause we have nothing left to hide 

Oh I adore the way you carry yourself 
With the grace of a thousand angels overhead 
I love the way the galaxy starts to melt 

Hold on to me girl 
If you feel your grip getting loose 
just know that I'm right next to you 
Hold on to me girl 
If you feel your grip getting loose 
Just know that I won't let you down 

Well, I'm ready 
Well, I'm ready 
I am ready 
To run away with you 
Are you ready? 
Are you ready? 
Are you ready? 
To run away with me 

Pack your things we can leave today 
Pack your things we can leave today 
Say our goodbyes and get on the train 
Say goodbye 
Just you and I in the sweet unknown 
We can just call each other our home 

If I had to choose a way to die 
it'd be with you 
In a goosebump infested embrace 
With my overanxious hands cupping your face 
In a goosebump infested embrace 
With my overanxious hands cupping your cherub face 

How does it feel?"

MISTAKE- i got up to go to the bathroom and left it up. hmm look who was sitting down in the chair when i got back. no it was not gabe. she could've at least pretended like she didnt see..but that would require brains..that of which she does not have.anyways made anew layout.. remind me never to do that again. quite aggrivating, too many numbers and codes i have to remember jeez. later kiddos"

We could live through these letters or forget it all together
See the months they don't matter it's the days I can't take
When the hours move to minutes and I'm seconds away

Just ask the question come untie the knot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
Retrace the steps as if we forgot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
We tried to avoid it but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

When all that you need is just a reaction
It's too much to ask for when there's no attraction anymore
When chasing our dreams is just a distraction
I want to remember when I know that I can't go back

Just ask the question come untie the knot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
Retrace the steps as if we forgot
Say you won't care Say you won't care
We tried to avoid it but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

There's one thing I can do nothing

-losing my voice
-getting made fun of for losing it
-watching dirty dancing with a boy whom i like very much. it was nice, that movie is one of my favorites.
-eating a fantastic dinner at yamatos 
-sitting on the deck at 11pm eating jolly ranchers with joe discussing our book that we will write.. ""the things that piss us off""...its quite a long book ;)
-realizing that dane cook is freaking hilarious
-tearing ugly wallpaper off the kitchen walls..that is THE most un-fun task ever. 
-getting in trouble for saying fuck (how gay)
-wacthing i love the 90s even though ive seen it like 20587 times. im addicted.
-talking to a friend who scared me into realization that im not too many years away from going through what he is.
-getting an invite to go out on the lake but turning it down cuz i feel like crap :( 
..my life is quite un-interesting when im sick it seems
OHH! the boy came back. the one that knocked on the door. he's selling some kinda lazyman's handbook for school or something. who knows. my mom bought some SAT software. i do not like him, he kept asking me to tell him what he thought of this or that. so now my throat hurts really bad and joe being the good pharmacy student that he is is making me some weird thing im supposed to gargle with..his analogy was ""its like ambosol for your throat"" so i was like bring it on. i guess we'll see.. lol"

(sry jess...that religion is insanely boring..and weird lol) anyways but he was standing out there for like 5 minutes and its INSANELY hot so i felt bad and opened the door ready to put on my distressed sickly face if the jesus talk was starting. but he was just all like hey hows it goin and i was like ummm fine..*confused face* evidently he is trying to sell his services lol his ""services"" ha ha no but really i think he's a tutor or something like that im not quite sure..he's supposed to come back tomorrow and hopefully i'll find out what he's selling then..maybe he's selling sexual services who the hell knows i think i had a 15 min conversation with the kid and i still dont. it was odd. he seemed nice/sincere enough to be for real but then again so do some rapists...so after he left i ran and told joe..of course joe being..well JOE laughed and then was like that wasnt smart be careful. yet this was the same guy who last night was like whenever your in college come to our frat parties! lol he cracks me up. anyways. the odd non-mormon fellow is gone. he tried to pull the whole are you still in high school? ""yes"" well you must be a senior this year right? ""no, sophmore"" ohh....really? *shocked face* i hate when people do that. i guess we'll see what happens...:-/ later kiddos"

HILARIOUS. quite entertaining if i do say so myself. i suprise myself sometimes.. which is good cuz living with yourself everyday gets kinda....boring...but oh well i think i'm stuck with me. my mom is being super nice to me and things are going pretty well which is awesome, guess all we had to do was bitch each other out..hmm quite odd..she's letting me paint my room BRIGHT ASS PINK and get a new bedspread to match WOO im excited! i think i'm gonna start taking drivers ed soon so i can get my effing liscense but that will require major motivation on the madres part...aka driving me all the way to the dmv dear lord its 5 mins away. but no complaints we're being civil for once and shes finally backing off of me a little..apparently yelling ""i wish you would leave me the fuck alone once and awhile"" unfortunately works. well gonna go, lunch is calling<BR>KELLEY-your hair is insane. and so is your truck.</P>"

But, turns out its not working out that way which really sucks but you and jeremy have a blast and tell me all about it. i'll try to get my mom to bring me up for a weekend trip or something but i dunno my mom finally decided that its time to fix up the house on the weekends..so we'll see. i'm sad you're not moving back but at the same time i'm happy cuz i know you are miserable here when you're at your house, which is quite understandable, i hope everything works out for you with everything. i love you. &amp;don't worry i know you love me too, cuz no one else would put up with all the shit that i do. lol</P>"

"event","well, i had everything worked out up until atlanta. then i was a) stuck b) being picked up by kelley or c) staying with joe. so as long as i could get b or c worked out id be all set to go. but as it turns out, i got BOTH of those set up and my gma decided she doesnt want to leave. theyre planning a plane for me on the 12th or something and i told them that all i wanted was to be back by the 4th to go to kelleys toga party. that was the ONLY thing i asked for, not attention, not money, not anything taking time out of their day. but apparently getting a flight for the 4th or earlier would, cause them to give me attention because they would realize i was leaving soon, would cause them to spend money on me because its such short notice and would take time out of their days becuz theyd have to take time off work (jesus christ lets all die cant let that happen). so to keep anyone from being inconvenienced im just staying here. my dads happy that im here indefinitely and my moms happy im not there. until she realizes how fucking much i do for her besides piss her off and make mistakes that she has to ""guard"" me from everything thats going to happen to me no matter what she tries to do. but whatever im fucking tired of everything that has to do with her, maybe its good im here, i can stop caring...indefinitely. my dads happy, my moms happy, thats all that matters. i guess i'll stay put then, to once again please everyone but myself. god i wish i fucking meant anything i said anymore. i cant even lie to myself."

ESPECIALLY when you dont fucking know someone. it still is quite odd to me why Ian didnt say anything to him about talking to me like that but at the same time it doesn't, boys aren't like they used to be. <EM>olden days that kid woulda got the shit beat out of him by ian for talking to me like that...nowadays it gets a chuckle.</EM> wonderful world we've got now huh. whatever. i'm leaving on monday and my mom decided to go on a power trip and if anyone wants to see me they have to come to me. blahh she loves pissing me off. i swear its her source of entertainment. but whatever anyways!</P>
<P>after the movie was over we left dom stranded cuz he wanted to go to the mall and we were just like umm nope. so we took off and ran over jed's prized sonic blow up bat! sorry jed!!!!!! :'-( god and then he got a call that he was supposed to be at work at 5 (it was 5:45 when we left) so yeah we hauled ass. then jill was supposed to come back here but jesse came into town so shes hangin out with him. its all good i didnt care, im going out of town with her in 2 days and she never gets to see him so i was happy for her &lt;3&nbsp; but this is entirely too in-depth about my day so im going to go now. and do nothing.&nbsp;</P>

Its not my fault i was tired of seeing you upset and worrying, shit i guess that makes me a bad friend huh. maybe theres a handbook on what i should do when someone's telling me how awful things are and blah blah blah. i should pick it up, cuz apparently doing something is not the friend thing to do. maybe i should have done nothing, cuz that woulda been a hell of a lot easier on me. cuz we all know my life is one fucking piece of cake all the time. but im not here to complain about me cuz i know lifes not easy and all that&nbsp;so im dealing.&nbsp;but hey i fucked up again whats new? ha&nbsp; anyways....so, i did what i thought was right, i still think it was right by the way and wont change my mind. but thats not the point. anyways i tried to help and what happened, i got fucked over, by TWO people, one of which <STRONG>isn't part of the situation either</STRONG> just thought i'd call that to your oblivious attention. but whatever, you made me part of the situation and then turned around and told me to stay the fuck out. whatever if your going to tell everyone how you feel BUT the person that actually needs to know go ahead, i promise you it wont solve anything but if it makes you feel better to put away messages up displaying to the world how miserable he is making you feel have at it. i'll sit back and let it happen cuz i dont fucking care anymore. i would say i talked to him because i love you and i dont want to see you upset, but seeing as i dont remember what love is, that feeling must not be what it was that made me do it. hopefully i find out soon what it was cuz im kind of confused at the moment. all i have left to say to you, and you know who you are,</P>

(?) so i'm not even going to try, things happen because they're supposed to. If your supposed to lose the people you love you will, theres no holding on to it. we're puppets on a string and our fate holds the end. you never know just where your going to be led next, to a room with great new best friends or smack into a broken heart, or maybe both at the same time so you get completely fucked and you have no idea how you feel anymore. but this is all self inflicted isnt it? who knows. someone please tell me cuz i sure as hell dont. how is it possibly for your heart to be shattered and completely overjoyed at the same time?"

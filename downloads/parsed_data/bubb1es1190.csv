yesterday went to some azn festival thing. was ok, i guess. not as big as i had imagined. but w/e. saw some good performances...i'm sure arjun will elaborate in his livejournal...food was ""meh"" not that great. i had some thai food.

nikkitasha's dad took my dad drinking...both got drunk. tashu's dad tried to convince me that i'm really karishma, and karishma is really me...i got very confused...just politely smiled. then my sister won a duckie(very very cute) whom she named ""orville"" and arjun won a monkey...whom he named ""bartholemew"" or however you spell it.

went to arjuns after. chilled. played with the dog. ate some crazy swedish meatballs. good stuff, and watched little britain, and goodness gracious me. pretty funny. then i went home, and watched ""two weeks notice"" love that movie. got no AP done.

thesse last couple of days have been pretty rough. and i guess i owe manny of you all explanations as to my attitude. my bitchyness. so, here goes...ok, george and i broke up. we're over. fine. although it was really hard for me at first...through all the crying, i came to realize that although i may have lost the perfect boyfriend, i have certainly gained one of the greatest friends. yes, it will be tough, getting over him...he was the one guy i really felt something with. the one guy i thought i could make it last. but hey, things happen. maybe we just werent meant to be...

on a happier note, my cousin and his friend are comin over from england today. so i wont be able to update in a while. i cant wait though, we're taking them to NYC. driving up there. ROAD TRIP. haha. yea. well, i guess i have to go and clean up.

ok, so yesterday was fun...i guess...i actually went somewhere, and did stuff. yay me. uh, a friend of the family's daughter turned one, so we all went to her birthday party. omg, she's sooo cute!! the party was suprisingly fun. it was at this park thingy, and it was real hot out. but the food was awesome..and there was this playground..monster playground...i mean the thing was HUGE! i couldnt hold in my inner-child, and hopped onto the swings. i got a few wierd looks from adults, but all was good. after pig-ing out on tacos (Baja Fresh baby!!) arjun and i left for the mall...

...the mall was fun. uh, we got there  and arjun decided that he wanted an ice cream. so we went to Ben and Jerrys. well, after standing in line for almost 15 minutes, we were told that they had run out of ""fudge brownie"" and arjun got MAS (haha jenna) at the extremely ghetto girl behind the counter. well then we waited...for the rest of the ""gang"" to show up. after circling Nordstrom for what seemed like forever, we FINALLY saw them all...jumping up and down, and waving at our ability to follow directions. uh...hmmm...well, then we just sat there, and did pretty much nuttin for the next half hour or so...omg. the highlight of the day HAD to be when pinkston, arjun and tara got in trouble with security...FUNNNY STUFF!! well, uh...then we chilled, and watched the fireworks. they were so beautiful...heavy sigh...and then we all went home...well half an hour later...cuz of traffic...it was insane. then i got home, and ate...im always hungry...but i prolly shouldnt have eaten all of those hot dogs..im STILL feeling sick..."

"event","today was pretty fun. i woke up pretty early because i had to babysit my sister...which was uh...interesting to say the least. so yea, i did pretty much nothing for the first half of the day, which is bad because i should have done some AP work. but the way i look at it...theres how many weeks of summer?!?! i mean, why start it on the second week of summer when you have like 9 more left?? yea, call it procrastinating, i dont care...i refuse to slave away over books and essays when i could be relaxing like normal ppl. 

then i got ready for leas house.she was like from 1 till 4-5 ish. well, we finally LEFT my house at 1:10, and went to pick up arjun. then we realized that we had no clue where we were going...which made my dad mad. we drove around sugarland until we finally spotted two pink flamingos in the front yard (they're very cute hun. lol.)

we watched Edward Scissorhands, which was suprisingly funny. the last time i watched it, i was seven and cried, because it was sad. but this time, it was hilerious...'its glowing...neon paint...' LOL! you guys rock. then we took a break and went outside, and ate cake. well, then we sat outside, and watched leas sister drop the cake on the table, over and over again, and lea attempting to fix her door. pretty funny stuff. then we went back and finished the movie...but katherine and jenni had to leave... and pinkston came.so then, we (by we i mean arjun) decided to watch the 'coolest movie ever' Garden State..which sucked major balls...we only watched two minutes of it...pinkston hated it and kept complaing so we went to Medowland, which was fun, i guess. but i was stressing out because my mom said she was coming. we quickly walked back to leas, and waited for my mom . after the first half hour, i started to get worried, so i called. did she have her cell on?? NO. i was mad. well, about an hour later, my dad rolls up in our pimpin mini van. lol. then arjun and i left. that was the end of all my fun. then i got home, and went on AIM, but hardly anyone was on...then i got kicked off, and now im goin to sleep. gnite

 it turns out george is goin to Myrtle Beach for a week...yea...i swear i dunno wut imma do...the seperation is gonna kill me. lol. i know its only for a week, but yea...iono...its still hard. like when he said bye...heavy sigh...lol. haha...i think im high. 

OK...well then my mom took me to Target (the BEST store ever) to buy a something special for a certain someone...lol. i also bought a pair of some much needed flip flops. yay. well, then we made a quick stop at Bed Bath and Beyond, and came home. i got online to say bye to my love (lol) but before i could, my mom made me come offline...which SUCKED. so then, for the next half hour, i sulked, and yelled at people.

then, when my parents FINALLY left for the movies (ewewew...they're WAY too old)i said bye to george...which was really hard........OK. so yea...then i got into a fight with andrew, and arjun, and was really bitchy to kartik...(sry guys) then i chilled with my sister..who is being very nice...which is VERY wierd. then shailen came. Shailen is my cousins son. hes only three months old, and is the cutest baby our family has ever seen...other than me of course...i was playing with him for awile...till he fell asleep...now im updating...DUH...ok, i guess thats all for now. sry its so long"

everything is gonna be so different next year...i hate change...i think theres even a name for it...Tropophobia...yea, dont ask how i know that...well, anyway...next year is gonna be so different. what if im not im da same art class with ian, or patrick?? what would PE be with out katherine?? or history with roohi? what if they seperate me, megan and alyssa?? AHHHH....

i guess it all worked out with 'u-know-who'. i mean, he said nuttin to me all day...lol. well, david did tell him durin our 25 minute break...and from what i hear, george asked for my number...im not gonna get all excited...i mean, like i've been saying OVER and OVER again...why would GEORGE like ME?? so, i guess imma try not to get myself all excited over nuttin...for all i know, he prolly wanted my number so he could call and tell me how he muchy he hates me...that would suck...eeeeek...ok, i think im over-analyzing this whole thing...haha. i'll stop. even so, i still feel like an idiot for not tellin him till last minute. now im not gonna see him for three months, and when i do, he prolly wont even remember me...im such a dork. haha-u were rite roohi and auesta. lol.

"event","i think it finally hit me...no more 'Burkey' lol. today was a very emotional day for me...haha phil. art has got to be the coolest class ever. so many good times...""what are tiny which ones?!?"" haha. yeah, well anyway, i had such a hard time saying bye to ms. burk today. i mean, i almost cried...so sad. i've learned a lot from da burke...like how triangles have four sides, and how you should watch out for tiny witch ones. omfg, i get away with so much crap in that class...im so screwed when i have Dadiego next year...eeeek. 

the health exam was probably one of the easiest exams i think i have(or will ever)take. it was sooooo easy. i got a 95!!! go me. it was really hard to say bye to Bauer too...all my teachers this year were really cool. i HOPE and PRAY i dont get Williams next year!!

ANYWAY... all his friends know. david said hes gonna find out if he likes me. i dont see why. its very clear that he doesnt. ...its just a crush people... a stupid crush...i dont see why everyone keeps telling me that im a loser for not telling him sooner. some things arent meant to be said... and this is one of them. After tomorrow there will be no question. i'll know for sure that he doesnt like me, and hey, maybe i'll even move on...but i still like the innocence of having JUST a crush..."

"event","You guys, i know this is gonna sound really lame and retarded, but it's really quite sad when you think about it...there's only three days of school left. My first year of high school has been so incredibly awsome.(although it wasnt as awsome as last yr...lol katherine)I remember this time last yr, katherine and i were so upset, and terrified about leaving middle school, and entering high school...well, it turns out high school isnt all that bad. :)i cant even put into words how much fun i've had this year. I met (and became friends with) so many cool people this year (i love you auesta, alyssa, megan,devon,allison...the list goes on...)thanks SO much you guys for putting up with me and my many issues. lol. i have no clue what i would do without you guys. y'all rock!!

~*Okay, enough of the sappyness*~

science sucked. lol. seriously, it did. okay, so i wake up late, 20 min before da bus comes...thats NOT enough time for me to have a shower, get ready AND straighten my hair. well, suprising, i got all of it done...dont ask how. i get to school, and find out that 50 points of my final exam depeneded on a stupid SRP write up that (of course) i didnt do. YAY ME! So, now im going to get a 150 out of 200 on my final exam. SCORE. i mean, i can see gould's reason why, but come on...50 points off cuz i didnt write a one page thing on my project. So lame...my mom is gonna try to write her...eeek.

TT on the other hand was awsome. so much fun!...well, 'HE' wasnt there, so it was'nt THAT great. lol. just kiddin...not THAT obsessed. well, anywho, it was tons of fun. we had a pizza party, and ate outside. then we had some awards thingy. everyone on da Kit KAt team an award. i got ""Krafty Kat"" sry, but i'm WAY cooler than you David! :) ms. glynn started dancing, and everyone had fun. Ms. Glynn is the coolest teacher ever...what am i gonna do next year without her?? *tear tear* lol. 

***i have three days to stop being a chicken, and tell him...i love how i can post this, and everone reading  knows exactly who im talkin bout except for him...so obvilious***

hmmmm...where to begin....well...OOOO, i'll start with the Annual Day performance at India International School (well, its actually a Jewish Community Center, but who cares...)  It was sooooooo kewl. We rocked (but then again, when do we not?! lol)i was so freaked out about the whole thing though. i have no clue y,but before we went on stage i seriously thought i was gonna throw up. i didnt even freak out that much before Wolf Trap. o well, everything turned out okay, so its all good.i still havent seen the video, so if anyone has it, could u make me a copy??? thnx

i had another bhangra performance yesterday. it was so flippin hot!!! we performed outside..in like 90 degree weather. I was sweating like a pig...it was gross.i'm not even kidding, my outfit was drenched. nasty stuff. all my make-up was smeared together, and running all over my face. i had eyeliner everywhere, and i looked like a clown. Straight after the performance, i went to Tara's birthday party. omfg, it was so much fun. i went straight from my performance, so i still had on my make-up (well, what was left of it anyway) as soon as i got there, gusman, pinkston and arjun poured ice down my back. it was horrible. well, like 5 minutes later, gusman pours water all over me. i was soaked...it sucked...i was wearing a white tank top...lol. well, i got gusman back...well, not really, he came back and poured TWO glasses of water on top of me, lol. haha, then we tied jeannie to a post, and i sprayed my hair blue. ~*HAPPY BIRTHDAY TARA!!*~

i got my hair cut, dont worry katherine, its not much... only about three inches. lol.

SIKE. we ran...A LOT...in the heat. i swear, i thought i was gonna get like a heat stoke, and die. lol. hehe, i looked like a plum when i came back inside.According to Devon, brown ppl dont go red, the go purple. lol. WELL, anyway, then i went to art. i love art. :) seriously, i do. our teacher is a total ditz (lol) and has no idea whats going on the whole time. For instance, i skip class to hang w/ roohi EVERY SINGLE art class for like 45 minutes, and she STILL hasnt caught on. im so screwed next yr when i have Dadiego...oh well

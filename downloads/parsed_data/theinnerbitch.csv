and my roses are drying up very nicely(not a word)
^A^ but acting like i don't know the unknown person would help x3
are we not Normal because we are not desparate over not being single? (wow lots of nots)i am sure i am straight xD 
but some ppl say that it would be sad if we are single when we reach 20s...hmm maybe we should play around. i don't think i like, liking someone first. most of u probably feel the same about to soome degree feeling content for having someeone else like you but...PSh for most cases, thats the furthest it will get. PSh

me so random"

"event","hello~
this is my second LJ account and i will try my best to keep this one really private in our new ""us"" group online (hahaha jk jk)

this i guess is my private rant thing that i don't want some people (caughcaugh) to read

my recent news:
sweetie was sent away to family friends place last friday
didn't tell you guys cause i didn't want it to bring it up...last friday, i ran out of the house cause i got pissed. went back and said bye to sweetie ><  i can still see him often
the family is close to us and they live up at aurara..and go the same church ;D

but still...i have no one to sleep with  ...  
sigh...i hate loosing pets...it like going back few years back when i had to leave my other dog behind...or when i heard she died...DSLFSKJF:L

(lol judging from shorty's msn blurb, she thought my previous msn name ""its hard to let go. i i miss you already"" was towards her. xD she wrote something like..its your loss on hers...so i was like wtf and changed it to clearly state my point --> ""its hard to let go. i miss you already. <3 sweetie forever""

Burn!

and yes
today because of astronomy project
i called Amc to help me so we would meet at 11ish at richmond green
i felt the need ( i dunno why now) to inform shorty about this and she said she would come >< (didn't expect that) and oh lord, amc +tong and young ho...was late in coming so i had some few awkard moments with her...Brrr
anyway AMC was really helpful. he took great pictures and just sent me my project half done <3 times like this i feel bad for...using him? but coffee hopefully made up for it xD
anyway after i came back
since i no longer had any business with shorty
i deleted her off from...i think almost everything online...so msn (all her 3(!) accounts i had lying around in my list, facebook...found out there was a blocking system, livejournal..blocked her, devaintart..again discovered the blocking system. 

Its official people~
we are now over!
If she is giving you the idea of me wanting her back or me being upset ""loosing a friend""
tell her to shove it up her whatever hole
cause your guilt trip will not work on me anymore
you call other people possesive and selfish...i suggest you look into a mirror

congrats for being the official second person in my life to be boycotted. (yes its very rare for me to do it --_--) first one was this other ex friend who was actually better than shorty but i turned my whole class against her (in grade 2 or 1 or 3...don't remember)

I hope you make new friends (no seriously)
and stay 100m diameter distance away from me

if we ever have to be in the same place
i am gonna act neutral and stickly business besides ignoring you
i am sorry if this brings any hardship to anyone else and I hope you go to glendon or any other school in the future

peace out yall"

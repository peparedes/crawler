3-learned the hard way about a lot of laws and that handcuffs are put on in the intention of dislocating ur shoulders
4-lost the gurl of my dreams after being arrested
5-passed all my classes, which is really saying sumthin about myself
6-got partially suspended, but dont worry, ill b back for state competition
7-fighting to get back the gurl of my dreams
8-o yea, for all yall nonbelievers, we won conference and the only way we can lose is injuries and bullshit refs
9-gymnastics started, and i suck

"event","guess wat?
we just kicked the shit outta conant.
we fried rice.  that would be tyler...he averaged like 300 yds b4 us.  against us he got 38.  who was a lil underrated in this matchup.  fuckin papers... atleast they will give us the lite of day now.  we knew we were good, we knew we were goin to win.  the only thing was we were the only people in the world who even thought we stood a chance to stand up against conant.  yea, we dominated them.  cept for like 2 min in the end of the 4 qt.  we got it back tho and scored.  

yea, who rocks?

go eg!"

"event","everyone always thinks that life for all the other stereotypical groups is so much easier.  what im trying to say is the foyer ratss all think that life is so easy for the jocks and the cheerleaders, while they are thinking that life would be so much easier if they just gave up like the others.  

but what happens if you dont belong to a specific group?  i feel that way alot...
for example i play football, however i am also in all honors classes.  its not like that hasnt been done before, but i dont rilly feel like i belong to the whole jock group at all.  then i do gymnastics so i am in that whole group, while maintaining the whole local scene.  if you know anything about any of these groups than you can begin to see how confusing life can be.  i dont feel like i have one specific area that i can focus on in my life.  it gets way too confusing.  

i rilly begin to hate life sometimes, but there is too much to live for to die; too many parties i havent gone to, too many girls i havent met yet, too many times to goof off in class."

"event","y do gurls suck so much?

i feel like im being blown off by a gurl who told me she is almost in love me

how does that work?  gurls need to find out wat they want and for them to go with it   just bc i say that im undecided about a relationship between the two of us y does that make u think im saying go away and i dont ever want to see u again    especially  after wat u did to me    i should be the one blowing u off, but no, somehow i became the bad guy in this whole ordeal!  

i hate u all so go fuck off...

then i find out another gurl likes me and she becomes open    so i think ok, ill try goin afta her, but then when i finally do make my move i get shot down!  wtf!

gurls, if u want a guy to understand u, plz make up ur own fuckin mind first!

o yea, im getting a pic soon, so stop frettin"

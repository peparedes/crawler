"event","You heard it right ladies and gentlemen, my hamster, princess, is indeed pregnant. She is due any day now, and the babies are going to be golden with white spots most likely and fluffy as hell. It is an exciting time, and if you feel the need for a hamster, a free hamster to fill your life with joy, feel free to contact me. She is nearly twice the size she used to be so this will probably be a huge litter. I am donating some to a pet store, but would like a few to go out to people I know, because I don't even know if the pet store will take all of the babies. If you are interested, or anyone you know TELL ME. They should be ready for adoption in 3 weeks, so get excited!!!!!!"

"event","I am so sore right now. My shoulder blades are aching. Is this normal? I don't know. I hate thanksgiving. I hate turkeys. I hate my job. I get along with most of the people I work with, but I hate my job, because I suck at it. I am too slow....oh sorry ""inefficient"". It makes me feel shitty, like I can't even do something really simple. So I am going to maybe pay Brighton Gardens a visit and see if I would be able to be trained as an RA there over winter break. Then I could come home and work sometimes over the weekends during the next semester. That way I could work there over the summer, and be fully trained. I need to start working where I belong. I don't want to screw anybody over, but I have the feeling that the meat department would be better off without me. After I hear what Brighton Gardens has to say, I'll talk to my manager about it. I feel that if I have not caught on by now, that I just never will. Maybe this just isn't right for me. I am so tired now, all the time. Even on my days off. This blows...."

"event","Just when I think I am getting ahead, something always has to go wrong. I got a job. A full time job, and it should pay well. I got a check froom my last job for 60 dollars the other day, and i put it in my bank account. The next day, I got a notice in the mail saying I overdrew from my bank account, and I would be charged 30 dollars for every item that put my over my amount. Okay it would not be so upsetting if I was over by more than 1 FUCKING DOLLAR!!!!!!!!!!!! I am so pissed. One dollar. And the part that really sucks is that I had plans for that money. I was gonna buy my Boose a new cage, I was going to buy gas, so I can have more than a quarter tank, and i was going to have minutes put on my cell phone. I was also going to pay travis back for the money he had to lend me because I was too fucking broke to buy my dad a fathers day gift. Now, I can only do one or 2 of those things.....or so i thought.......until today. I was thinking about getting some lights to put on my tires that look all pretty when they spin around, so before work, I swear I looked at my wheels on my way in the door to imagine what it would look like.  (I know I am a big nerd) Anyway, I finally get to leave work, and I am missing a fucking hubcap! I do not know where it went, but it was on my car earlier and then it was gone. Unless I lost it on my way to work, I had to have been stolen, but who the fuck would take it? I know they cost about 50 dollars to replace, but there are nicer hubcaps to be stolen than mine. If i am just delusional, and the thing was not on my car this afternoon, then I do not know when it fell off. I can admit that I smack the occasional curb because I pull out of places too fast every so often, and my vision is not the nest at night, but lately, I have not hit anything like that. If anything fell off, it should have been my brakes, even though the last incidient I had with the brakes was more the hydroplaning's fault than mine...or the brakes. Damn wet roads. But yeah....I have to spend what little money I have left on mew hubcaps. I think they sell 4 shiny ones for 20 dollars at target.....those will have to do. I should just stop getting my hopes up about money....it is never gonna be okay in that department for me again. I give up! Ugh....ok it is time for bed...or not...I dunno."

"event","Well I guess I should update since I never do that sort of thing, but where do I start? First, I got my grades....not so bad.....I did not do as well as I had hoped, but I did better than what I had planned for....had I known before the last day to withdraw pass a class that without chemistry I would have been close to making the deans list, I would have said fuck the scientific math class that BG pretends is chemistry. Instead, I failed it. GO ME!!!!!!!!!!! I got B's in pretty much everything else, but I am a little upset thaT psych and geology were not A's....I was soooo close! What else? Oh yeah.....got the tax returns and bought a hamster named Boose (inside joke) I have been told that Boose is a female, but in my heart, it will always be a ""he"". He's all cute...he's grey or black with white by his feetsies and a white stripe down the middle of his little self. He is the sweetest hamster ever...he doesn't bite or anything, and he is so cute it makes me wanna cry when I look at him. He's my baby. What else........Been hanging out with Jennifer lots........YAY for that....I miss her when I go to school...and I have been carting Justin's (jew-boy's) ass to school almost every morning. Oh yeah.....and I see Travis once or twice a week.  I had a job at a small family restaurant/diner type deal as a server, but i worked there one day and quit....if I am barely getting any tips and making 2.13 an hour, you bet your ass I am not working from 2pm to 9 pm 6 days a week. Give up my social life for no pay? I think not. Soooooooo.....now I work at Wendy's making 7 dollars an hour and not dealing with people....I work the grill. I suck at it now, but give me a week or two and I will become the fucking grillmaster! It's kinda funny that i am saying this, but I think Wendy's is the best job I have had in a long time. Yay for that! pk this is too long for me so I am going to stop talking............bye!"

"event","So yeah........about those friends from last year that I like to bitch about......I miss them. Well, I will be honest and say I don't really REALLY miss all of them, but a particular two of them, I really do miss........ I imed one of them, and said I was sorry about what I did....(She had more than a little reason to be mad at me, I changed rooms on her when I was supposed to live with her, and I didn't even tell her), and the other one I had to email, since thanks to someone not to be mentioned, I was blocked on aim by that certain person. I was really close to the second person I mentioned. Nobody could make me laugh like she did, and I made her laugh hysterically all the time too. I miss her a whole lot. We BOTH screwed it all up, but my part was worse I think. I could not be in a bad mood when I was around her when things were okay, and she was the best listener, and I like to think I was a good friend to her too before all the bad stuff happened. But I miss her a whole lot.....and this was all I could say in that email...........

Hey.....sorry I took so long to say this, but I have no balls and I wanted to give you space, because smothering you would not be cool. I wanted to say that I'm sorry. What I did was wrong and stupid, and I would take it back if I could, but I can't. I honestly do not remember what I said to make you upset, but I swear I would never mean to hurt you like that. I said a whole lot of things the end of last year, mainly because I was hurt and angry, but I also said them because I didn't think you would have cared about anything I had to say. I didn't really think that you took me seriously anymore. Anyway, I am not going to say anything else, because I don't want to badger you if you don't want to hear it. If you do not want to talk to me or think this is a lost cause, I do not blame you at all, I couldn't anyway. All I ask is that whatever you want to do, whether it's to just leave things the way they are right now or not, just let me know.....email me back or something. Well, thank you for listening.....

p.s.-I am sorry about Katie talking to you on my name, 
I swear on my life that I was not in the room when she
started that. I never asked her to do that, and I think
I recall asking her not to try to do that. Though I know
she had the best of intentions, my computer is now password
protected and that will not happen again."

Mind you this is exam week that they expect you to work 4 shifts in.

Then some people came in the party and told us that the cops were circling the area. Since we were all under 21, (the group that i went with) We definitley left. Oh I forgot to mention the fact that it was like pouring and thunderstorming and stuff that night and we walked through it on the way there and the way back. I was wearing my big sandals, and i had to take them off because they got too slippery and i didn't want to break an ankle.

Nobody made plans or anything, and when I tried to make plans with one of them, they'd just randomly go do something else, so I just stopped hanging out with them...so I guess that makes me the bitch they think I am.

He doesn't know how I feel, but he will. I need space. I need to be happy. He needs to know that I am NOT stupid, I DO use my good judgement, and that good Judgement is DAMN good by the way, and he needs to not think less of me just because I am not a nerd like him. So I'm not an honor student, I don't have an 18 pound bookbag, and I don't leave for class a half an hour early. who the fuck cares? I don't......no really...I don't...but he thinks that that somehow makes him better than me. I knew from the start that he was stuck on himself, but I never thought that he would be the type of person to say he loves me but think I'm a retard and think all of these bad things about me. It hurts to know that someone who is supposed to appreciate me and respect me, not to mention love me, could be okay with not thinking anything nice about me. I sometimes wonder why he can be happy with me if he thinks he is so much better. Maybe his whole conceited thing is just an act to make me think I might lose him, therefore making me stay since he is sooooooooo amazing and I am such a moron. Well I AM a moron for putting up with this shit. I am seriously about to carry around a newspaper (rolled up), and a bottle of lemon juice, so when he steps out of line I can spray him in the eye and smack him upside the head or on the nose. Maybe that will teach him. Well, I think I might be ready for bed. This is all for now."

"event","I had my 4th day of placement today. I really like where I am. Its a resource center that offers a range of services and resources to individuals in the community. WE (there are two students) are being given free reign to basically choose our own path so i am thinking youth and health stuff will be my two major focuses. Its so nice to be in an environment where everyone seems to generally like and respect each other. so different from ""the program"". 
Im feeling better about the previous posts-thanks to M and M for your support. Unforunately, as i am sure you both understand, I wont go into details in the open forum so ill have to leave the details vague. I AM doing better in my head, slowly figuring stuff out and hoping that ill find a healthy happy medium with this. now how vague is that??
lol
anyway, I think im gonna do some readings then bed down for the nite."

"event","Despire the continued rolling in my stomach, I feel more calm then i have in days. Funny how a short conversation with the right person can do that. I have learned a lot this week, about reading into things, and not letting whatever is happening between me nad this person get in the way of who i am. I lost myself this week, temporarily and that scares me. I let my low self esteem and inexperience get in the way of seeing things clearly, rationally. I need to learn not to do that.
Tomorrow is another day and will bring new insights into where we are headed, if anywhere....

"event","ok, ya im a big hockey geek, but this was a great game. lots of physical play, nice hits on both sides, too many penalties called though. highlight was the Big line of heatley, spezza and alfie scoring points again. that and spezza beating the crap out of some leafs player. so sad too bad. 

I watched the game at my sisters. I havent spent much time with her or her 4 kids this fall because of school and its nuts to see them for that amount of time and see how much they have changed. My 9 year old nephew needs a kick in the pants-holy rudeness tonite. 5 year old was on xmas time and kept tackling me. that was fun. 7 year old niece was mostly behaved and took good care of her 1 year old sister when she started playing strange with me. Highlight: diaper clad niece crawling onto teh couch to give me a kiss and a hug and to utter ""hockey"" for hte first time. shes gonna be indoctrinated! Im so proud!

and for the record I dont hate all people. I do HATES Golum Though.
over and out...."

"event","Ok all week I have felt tired and anxious and ""poopy"" and it turns out that my calcium was running really low. This might explain at least part of my paranoia and stress this week. I also got a nice email from a friend and so maybe the world isnt what it seems. Im heading to workout for the first time since Tuesday and then going to go hang with my sister and the ""chicklets"" (aka the kids). Sens play the Evil Empire (er The Toronto Maple Leafs) tonite so it will be fun to sit on the couch and watch with my nephew et al. Go SENS GO! (yes i really am a Sens-addict)
To quote my good friend who graduated from social work last year:
Nothing but love, my friends

"event","ok first entry. If you know me, you will agree that its only appropriate that my first entry have a chocolate theme. 
I just got in from my friend's place and we made the most amazing chocolate coated chocolate cookies EVER. I usually dont advocate screwing with baking recipes because they tend to get messed up however...they accidently double the butter and these were soooo good. 
ok so try these for xmas:

1 1/2 cups of self rising flour
1 1/4 cups of cocoa
1 tsp of apple spice (we just used a combination of cinamon, allspice and nutmeg)
1/4 of butter (double away my friends)
1/2 cup of super fine sugar
1 egg
1 egg yolk
oven should be at 350
mix the ingredients together in a bowl as you would normal cookies (wet to dry)
kneed on floured surface and cut the large piece into two
Make two logs about 2 inches thick (these are then cut into little round thick cookies)
These are then placed on a buttered baking pan and put in the fridge (or outside in this weather!) for 30 minutes.
bake for 10 minutes

these cookies are then cooled and dipped in/decorated with dark and light merkins chocolate (you know those little round chocolates that melt well)
let them set. you can mix and max, half white.dark, or dark then white stripes, sprinkle sparkles or cocoa. Sky is the limit!!
make something hot to drink and EAT!

ok. first journal entry completed.
how do i sign off?"

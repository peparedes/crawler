"event","Chris Serico is the person who maintains the Twitter humor-account &quot;Every Tweet Ever&quot;. It&#39;s actually an amusing commentary on how one&#39;s feed can get clogged up with very similar tweets when certain events are happening. I&#39;d been following it for about a year.

Serico lives in New York, and, as became apparent last week, is a fan of the New York Rangers hockey franchise. In case you don&#39;t follow ice hockey, the Rangers are currently playing in the Stanley Cup finals against the Los Angeles Kings. The Kings, who are a juggernaut, have raced out to a three-games-to-none lead over the Rangers in this best-of-seven series. Winning one more game should be fairly simple, and the Kings should be celebrating their second Stanley Cup in three years.

Understandably, Serico isn&#39;t thrilled about his team of preference losing like this. I wouldn&#39;t expect any Rangers fan to be happy with the direction the series has gone so far. However, instead of venting in his personal Twitter account, Serico has decided to air his grievances out in his auxiliary humor-based account.

Here are some examples of tweets during game 2:

Now, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and pondered the possibility that there&#39;s a little bit of meta-humor going on here. It&#39;s possible that he&#39;s not a Rangers fan and it&#39;s just him poking fun of his feed being filled with Rangers fans all tweeting similar things. Even if that&#39;s the case, then his handle - which is, if you remember, &quot;Every Tweet Ever&quot; - is a bit of a misnomer. Every Tweet Ever is supposed to be a universal thing, not a New York-centric thing. The above tweets spoil the joke and wind up being not really all that amusing. So I decided that if he did something like that again during game 3 (which was played last night), I was going to comment on it.

The Kings dominated the Rangers in game 3, to the score of 3-0. Sure enough, Serico took to his Every Tweet Ever account to vent more frustrations. The first tweet that popped up made reference to the Justin Williams goal that was scored with 0.8 seconds on the clock at the end of the first period. I don&#39;t recall the exact wording of the tweet (it was deleted and I did not get a screenshot), but it was something along the lines of &quot;the puck had not crossed the goal line entirely!&quot;

I decided to respond to this tweet. I replied with &quot;Every New York Tweet Ever.&quot; I think that&#39;s both fair and accurate. I also did my best to call out the account without calling out the composer of the tweet, because, like I said before, he may not really be a Rangers fan and he&#39;s just poking fun at his local friends who were tweeting about the game.

Shortly after replying to his tweet, Serico deleted the tweet. Not wanting my orphaned tweet hanging there with no context, I deleted my reply (hence no embedded tweets or screenshots). Shortly thereafter, Serico tweeted this:

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en"">




<p>INSUFFERABLE KINGS FANS</p>&mdash; Every Tweet Ever (@EveryTweet_Ever) <a href=""https://twitter.com/EveryTweet_Ever/statuses/476172654194741248"">June 10, 2014</a></blockquote>




Instead of replying to that one - with the possibility of the parent tweet being deleted again - I decided to publicly tweet this to my account:
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en"">




<p>Definitely time for <a href=""https://twitter.com/EveryTweet_Ever"">@EveryTweet_Ever</a> to change their name to &quot;Every New York Tweet Ever&quot;</p>&mdash; Marky Narc (@markynarc) <a href=""https://twitter.com/markynarc/statuses/476176919202107392"">June 10, 2014</a></blockquote>





Serico responded by blocking me from Every Tweet Ever. Personally, I think that&#39;s extremely childish and thin-skinned. It also reeks of a person who is more than willing to dish it out, but whose attitude changes when they&#39;re asked to take a little ribbing back in return. I don&#39;t think my tweets (all two of them) were harassing, they were merely poking fun at someone who generates a little humor by poking fun at others. I called Serico out on his BS and his response was to pick up his ball in a huff and go home. As far as I can tell Every Tweet Ever has not tweeted anything else since then.

So I guess that&#39;s it. When Serico blocked me, it automatically unfollowed me from Every Tweet Ever. I&#39;m not going to re-follow. The funny part is, I&#39;m not even a Kings fan. I was blocked for pointing out something that seemed pretty obvious. Anyway, I just wanted to document all this, because I do think it&#39;s mildly amusing."

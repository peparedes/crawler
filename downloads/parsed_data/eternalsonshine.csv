"event","I am tired of looking at you people around me and thinking how sad, how much theyve changed.  Tonight i was thinking about it on the way how home how absolutely messed up i am now, and its no one elses fault but my own, i accept full responsibiity for all of it.  I decided i am sick of being addicted, sick of being on a leash.  Im Sick of watching other ppl on their leashes that they put there.  Humanity is so eager to kill and condemn themselves its riduclous.  People have gotten waaaay too comfortable on their skin in their little world and are so SELFISH (including me) that they/we begin to actually believe that us is all there really is.  Im sick of you hipocrites, im sick of myself, a hipocrite!  Its L-A-M-E.  We need to get over ourselves because we arent anything special, there has been billions of us before and there will be after our lives.  Do you know what the consequences are to a sinful life?  I do, but yet i still continued to be lame and keep it up.  I said well hey i mean i can rock out to a worship song and i still go to church and i pray and read sometimes the Bible and believe in God and Jesus but thats not it.  We are so selfish we recognize this and we just want to ignore it because we know that if we focus on God then we arent focused on ourselves, on our pitiful little lives.  I look at myself, who i am now and i see little of actual value.  Take a look at yourself, a good look.  Now, do you like everything, every little detail that you see.  You know yourself more than anyone else on this planet so youre the only one who can fix yourself.  DO IT.  Before its too late and you are covered in fire and brimstone and damnation FOREVER, that is a very very very long time.  Is doing that lame stuff you do really worth it?  Its not for me so im gonna change myself.  Starting from the ground building up.  Think about it."

"event","wow so today, this week, this year have all been kind of like awakening.  its hard sometimes looking at how far you have come because its hard to not focus on what you had and have lost, for me at least.  i want to be like ""ok youre back in my life like u used to be, you too, oh ya you as well"" ya know?  you want to be in control because you want everything to be like it was when things were perfect in little parts of your life and combo them all together and everything just to be wow perfect.  its hard for me to think that if its hard right now, im only 18, i might live to 100, thats 5 times what i have done, thats many times the memories and losses to deal with.  do you ever feel like maybe because of something or a few things that happened to you you are a changed person?  i know i can think of at least 3 things that are under that category, things that if i could change i would, things that i think make a person lose touch of reality a little bit.  lately ive been in a very clouded confused state just kind of going day by day, clutching to the fact that one day it will all become clear why it all happened like this why i had to go through that and i will be happy, genuinely content.  i want this to be now but thats not how things go.  i want to know why, but many people do, i want those things that hurt a long time ago to just go away for good.  so ill keep holding on and trying and not giving up.  because thats who she was and i know thats who i am."

"event","so, ever feel like you have something really big that is just bursting to be used or put into action, but you cant do that?  thats very vaguely how im feeling.  Its driving me bonkers i mean why would God give me this or allow me to have it if he didnt give it to me and give me the strongest desire to use it but i cant, not now not ever.  It just frustrates me and drains on me a lot of the time and I just want my prayers for it to go away to be answered... please.

other than that im great, mission trip was unforgettably perfect."

"event","ugh today... so i got up, dropped off some rolls of film, went to school to get my schedule butchered, worked on stuff to prep for mission trip, eye appt, and work at 5:30.  So i got to school, wait a while, get in there and it turns out like nothing, nothing works, it all overlaps and stins bad.. long story short i went in asking for 1 1/2 ap, 1 dual, rest hon and reg classes and came out with 1 ap and 3 dual... yuhhhg.  lets just say mondays will be bad, i have to be at pjc at 8 for bio, get out at 9, which is same time my dual eng class at pjc starts, so run there then be at whs in 15 mins, go to school til 2:45, rush to swimming, swim for an hour to make up for missed practice, run to pjc again by 4 for lab til 5:45 and thats when i can go home, do homework eat and sleep.. ugh i hate school.  

other than that this is a great day, maybe itll rain and no work.  mission trip sat woop woop!"

"event","so im sitting here, after dennis, its dark, ive got this cute little puppy on my lap typing.  so dennis today was bad.  thats all i can say, it was bad here at my house at least.  it was good to everywhere else though in p'cola..  ive never really been scared of/during a hurricane, but today i was really scared, ive never seen winds like it. it even opened my house, the poolhouse double doors with the wind, it had to be 140 at least, but enough about that, its amazing were ok and so is everyone that i know of.  @ my house we lost one big oak, one split and has to be cut, about 20 big big branches, the fence is shot, uhh we need a blue roof, (i mean we have NEVER had roof damage until this hurricane and it wasnt good, and it was such STRONG wind ok im done w/ that) well i have talked to a few ppl and everyones ok so if youre out of town, you really dont have anything to worry about coming back to.. unless you live near escambia bay or another water body.  my poor aunt and uncle are here w/ us cuz theyre roof peeled away 1/2 their house, stinks.  well my dad needs to change the gas in the generator and when he turns it off the comps gonna die so im out.  sweet dreams."

"event","so.. dennis is a cat. 4 now?  

umm i think im about to get a little scared

i definately spent 2 hours waiting to get gas tonight, 11-1 and i feel like junk, but everyone seems to right now, so im not gonna complain any more.

i was in the best mood ever today, then i overdosed on ibuprofen, ok well maybe not but

when i told this story earlier i got laughed at, but um theres this tree, its in my front yard, and after ivan it has been leaning and one side of the ground ir like a foot lower than rest and other side is a foot higher and my dad says its gonna fall.  And i went to our boat today and helped my dad prep it for dennis, but theres not much you can do i guess and we spent a few hours doing stuff, but im afraid the whole dock is going to go.  People keep saying the bluffs are going to all fall into the bay, i hope not.  Well i wasnt gonna complain, but i did.  sorry.

so i really dont want to work any more at my job cuz its mind-numbingly boooooooooooooooooooooring being a lifeguard and people say that after the last storm, it was soo damaged that if it happens a little bit worse they wont re-open it, so i wont have to work any more!  yay.  i guess

kinda funny how vicious people can get over gas too

i love how people will read this randomness.

have a GREAT NIGHT!"

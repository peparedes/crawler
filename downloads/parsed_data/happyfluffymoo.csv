"event","i was watching crazy/beautiful the other night and most of you know the movie and probably know the beginning of the movie when she is talking. but i was listening to it and i thought that it was like the best thing ever. i think this is like the motto for my life right now. 



<i>You can be anywhere when your life begins...

       When the future opens up in front of you... 

             And you might not even realize it a first... 

                                   But it's already happening.</i>




i dunno i am soooo corny that i love this quote. its just self explainitory. but yea thats about all i wanted to say for now....


oh and deej thanks for the talk last night i wish i could have helped you more : (

anywaysssssss



lots of love,

"event","You've found hope, you've found faith,
Found how fast she could take it away.
Found true love, lost your heart.
Now you don't know who you are.
She made it easy, made it free,
Made you hurt till you couldn't see.
Sometimes it stops, sometimes it flows,
But baby that is how love goes.

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.

It's a secret no one tells;
One day it's heaven, one day it's hell.
It's no fairy tale; take it from me,
That's the way it's supposed to be.

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.

You laugh, you cry, no one knows why
But OH the thrill of it all...
You're on the ride, you might as well
Open your eyes

You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.

Even angels fall
Even angels fall"

Oooh oooh oooh...

Ever so sweet...
you make this seem
the way things go
its not my fault
and i'll miss
i'll miss you so good
through all of those nights
we lost our way back home

Ever so sweet 
you baked it in cakes for me. 
What you left behind, 
it hurts my teeth. 
Bring in the past 
with the postcards you sent for me. 
Every line, 
it brings me right back down.

Can't you see the wall you built for me
can't you see the wall you built for me
can't you see the wall you built for me

Cause we're not special
we're not special
we're not special

Well i'm not special

Ever so sweet 
you baked it in cakes for me. 
What you left behind, 
it hurts my teeth. 
Bring in the past

I could live a thousand years

If I could be alone with you

You

Every second of my life

I would never play the fool

Never turn my back to you

I was the one who saw you first

A grain in the sands of the universe

I never knew what was ahead of me

Now I'm out of the eyes of the wintertime

And here in the sun

I'll stay inside your shades of love 

Makes one day forever

And when July has come and gone

This day will last forever

When I see the way you look

The way you look my way

Through the rain

And the water crashing down

Washes both of us away

Away

I was the one who saw you first

A grain in the sands of the universe

I never knew what was ahead of me

Now I'm out of the eyes of the wintertime

And here in the sun

I'll stay inside your shades of love

Makes one day forever

And when July has come and gone

This day will last forever

I'm here inside your shades of love

Makes one day forever

And when July has come and gone

This day will last forever

She's all I see in front of me

She's all I need...

I could live a thousand years

If I could be alone with you

And here in the sun

I'll stay inside your shades of love

I'm here inside your shades of love

i just legit cleaned the whole room.

moved all my old furniture out and moved all the new furniture in. 
and i dont have a bed tonight : (

but yea this whole weekend has sucked
i spent most of it doing my veitch paper
tomorrow i have to finish it and do my app for keene state cuz hold on a tick.....i have the audition on friday.

i will be freaking out all this week. 
i don't think i am ready

and i wish i could sing my pieces through once for people who i feel have a valued opinion. 
especially since both of my songs go up to a high C and i think i am flat. and i want to be able to sing it through and have someone tell me how it honestly sounds. 

and i have one voice lesson before it. 

wednesday night at 645.

but i do love both of my pieces. 
the italian one is sooo good. 
then i am singing something from handel's messiah. wicked hard.
soo nervous!

anywho!
i hope everyone had a great weekend. 

I found advantage of bveing grounded.
~~next weekend i am going to Urban Outfitters and buying soo many new clothes con mi mama

so i have decided to change things up a bit.
i am think that i am too confined and i need to spread my wings a bit.
i want to chill with more people than the confined group i'm in now.
i want to chill with jordan, dan, veiga, jess c., doobes, jennie, and stacy more often. 
its like i never get to see them. : (

so yea i think things will be changing for me soon.
lots of love

From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, boy,
My heart said follow through
But I know now that I'm way down on your line
But the waiting feeling's fine.
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing.
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb,
I wanna know when you're gonna come.

See, I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,
'Cause summer is here, I'm still waiting there,
Winter is here and I'm still waiting there.

Like I said, it's been three years since I'm knocking on your door
And I still can knock some more.
Ooh boy, ooh boy, is it crazy love ? I wanna know now
For I to knock some more. You see...
In life I know there is lots of grief
But your love is my relief.
Tears in my eyes burn, tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting, while I'm waiting for my turn.

See, I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,

  THIS RIDE
it says hold on and take this ride
and set aside
memories of all the times
when you collide
then you'll leave me here to die
heres the things i meant
but never said

it says sit back and take the time
to lose your mind
and find out what its like to die
so wheres my spine
when its time to give an obvious and simple reason why
i wont write again

what do you see
when you look at me
do you take me for a fool

so what makes you play this game
with results always the same
and nothing but bad reputations to gain
it speaks to me like all is fine
and i could cry
from all the bends and breaks that i
took this time
when happieness is based on lies
its so hard its too hard to tell the truth 

what do you see
when you look at me
do you take me for a fool
this fool is through

this fool is through
this fool is through

what do you see
when you look at me
do you take me for a fool

what do you see
when you look at me
do you take me for a fool

it says hold on and take this ride
and set aside
memories of all the times

i thin a lot people feel this way.

i guess now i am the bad guy. and i know that i need to stop being so defensive. 



what you said that day i gave you a ride home, really put things in persective for me. but i need help. i cant do this alone.

mostly everyone around me are so happy. andi am soo stressed out from so much stuff. 

i love all you guys, and i regret saying anything mean to you. 

this isnt worth it. we're all leaving to go to college 9/10 months. lol
it may seem far away but its going by so fast and i dont want to go leave knowing things could have been different. 



forget whatever i've said
i love you all too much to care
you are my true fit
every single one
forget regret
lets not look back and see anger
let lookforward and see the good times

Josh Groban

Tell me his name 
I want to know 
The way he looks 
And where you go 
I need to see his face 
I need to understand 
Why you and I came to an end 

Tell me again 
I want to hear 
Who broke my faith in all these years 
Who lays with you at night 
When I'm here all alone 
Remembering when I was your own 

[Chorus:]
I let you go 
I let you fly 
Why do I keep on asking why 
I let you go 
Now that I found 
A way to keep somehow 
More than a broken vow 

Tell me the words I never said 
Show me the tears you never shed 
Give me the touch 
That one you promised to be mine 
Or has it vanished for all time 

[Chorus]

I close my eyes 
And dream of you and I 
And then I realize 
There's more to love than only bitterness and lies 
I close my eyes 

I'd give away my soul 
To hold you once again 
And never let this promise end 

[Modified Chorus:]
I let you go 
I let you fly 
Now that I know I'm asking why
I let you go 
Now that I found 
A way to keep somehow 
More than a broken vow"

so then tonight i went to my brother for a bit (got an ice coffee before i went over there and now i am soo awake!)  and his best friend aaron who he went to college with works at curry college now in admissions and he told me that with my grades and SAT scores i can definately get into curry as a safety school. and ryan, my brother went there so thats a plus too, and i know aaron who will put in a good word for me. so i am in good shape there.

so tomorrow i am looking at bu...i doubt i will even get in but i want to see what their music program is like. i need to start really comparing each program. i need to narrow them down.

but yea my tour tomorrow is at 11 so i will be back in the afternoon. i am goin with my dad. kinda like a father, daughter day and we most likely will go on the tour then go to china town to eat...oh yea..lol

so call the cell anytime before 11 then anytime after 12:15 lol

if anyone want info about bu let me know. 

lots of love

"event","Why do we play with fire?
Why do we run our finger through the flame?
Why do we leave our hand on the stove-
Although we know we're in for some pain?

Oh, why do we refuse to hang a light
When the streets are dangerous?
Why does it take an accident
Before the truth gets through to us?

Cages or wings?
Which do you prefer?
Ask the birds.

Fear or love, baby?
Don't say the answer
Actions speak louder than words.


Why should we try to be our best
When we can just get by and still gain?
Why do we nod our heads


Although we know


The boss is wrong as rain?


Why should we blaze a trail
When the well worn path seems safe and
Jonathan and Susan:
So inviting?


How-as we travel, can we


See the dismay-
And keep from fighting?


Cages or wings?
Which do you prefer?
Ask the birds


Cages or wings?

Ah...


Fear or love, baby?
Don't say the answer


Actions speak louder than words


Louder than, louder than


What does it take
To wake up a generation?


How can you make someone
Take off and fly?


If we don't wake up
And shake up the nation
We'll eat the dust of the world
Wondering why


Why


Why do we stay with lovers


Who we know, down deep


Just aren't right?


Why would we rather


Put ourselves through hell
Than sleep alone at night?


Why do we follow leaders who never lead?


Why does it take catastrophe to start a revolution?


If we're so free, tell me why?


Someone tell me why
So many people bleed?


Cages or wings?
Which do you prefer?
Ask the birds.


Cages or wings?

Ah...


Fear or love, baby?
Don't say the answer.

Louder than, louder than, ooh


They speak louder
Actions speak louder than...

"event","so i have had like the busiest week. but tonight i chilled with pat and emily which was so much fun! cuz i havent chilled with either of then in a while. and we saw katie and dj : ) that was cool. and i found 2 shirts at gadzooks that i need! anyway work tomorrow...hair cut W0o0o0o00o0o0o0o! then something else but i need to make sure about it. anyway talk you all later!


I'm a punk rock prom queen
Brown paper magazine
Hotter than you've ever seen
Everywhere and in between
I'm a ten ticket thrill ride
Don't you wanna come inside?
Five star triple threat
hardest of the hard to get
No one's little red corvetter
Ain't seen nothing little yet

CHORUS
It's been 6 whole hours
And 5 long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words
Were way too late
'Cause you can't see that I'm the one

I'm your late night head rush
Ace high royal flush
Red velvet orange crush
You just don't impress me much
A glossy, double cover spread
Opened up inside your head
A black cherry paradise
Half the sugar, twice the spice
I don't wanna treat you nice
Come on baby roll the dice!

It's been 6 whole hours 
And 5 long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words 
Were way too late
Can't you see that I'm the one?

It took 6 whole hours 
And 5 long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words 
Were way too late
Cause you can't see that I'm the one

It took 6 whole hours 
And 5 long days
For all your lies to come undone
And those three small words 
Were way too late
Cause you can't see that I'm the one

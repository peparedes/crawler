"event","<p>The Alley was wet, and stinking, and disgusting.&nbsp; But it was Home, or at least the closest to a Home, Tyrone had had in such a very long time, And in the right corners, you could find the real dealers.&nbsp; The ones who pushed the &quot;real&quot; shit.&nbsp; Cut with delicious household chemicals, bits of bleach and chlorine, anything to cut the product and stretch that extra buck.&nbsp; Tyrone, skinny little, Tyrone, he paced one Alley&#39;s end to the other, eyes sharply wandering this way and that, looking for any bit, or piece he could sell, or steal, or, or or....</p><p>The Life of a junkie.</p><p>It was another day in the shithole of downtown Van Nuys, Fall had come and gone, leaving the frozen corpse of winter to linger behind, and the city was miserable.&nbsp; Alternately freezing, and soaking, and gusting, Tyrone could barely feel the discomfort through his own discomfort though, the itching undeniable need.&nbsp; That need.&nbsp; Need.&nbsp; IT was all he had left to drive him.&nbsp; He certainly didn&#39;t have the will left to kick it, no, he needed that rush far too much to leave it behind.&nbsp; And an offing was simply out of the question, even if he could bring himself to do it, he had no method, except perhaps leaping into traffic, or jumping off a high-rise parking structure.&nbsp; Even then, he&#39;d have to go down to Oxnard, and that was Sergei&#39;s territory.&nbsp; The Russians wouldn&#39;t be happy to see him in any form breathing, so the question was right out.&nbsp; Instead, on filth-crusted hands and knees, Tyrone searched the Alley.&nbsp; Every once in a great while, luck would be with him, someone&#39;s pocket would have a hole in it, they would throw out the half of a sandwich they never ate, and Tyrone would have another day, in semi-comfort, doped out, with a bit of food even.</p><p>The rain had started again, as Tyrone made his circuit of the alleyway, coming to one end, peering into the street, watching all the well-to-do people marching up and down the worn pavement, and doing their absolute best to ignore the troubles staring directly in their eyes, begging for scraps.&nbsp; Tyrone turned away from the edge of concrete, where Alleyway and Sidewalk met, he couldn&#39;t even muster the strength to Hope for a handout even, much less ask for one, and crawling ever-so-carefully, he continued his ambulatory, keeping his dark eyes focused to the corners and cricks and cracks of the Alley&#39;s ground, anywhere a dime, or dollar could have fallen to.&nbsp; So intent was he on the ground, that he didn&#39;t even noticed the stranger in his Alley.&nbsp; Even had he, Tyrone would surely have assumed it another of the junkie pieces-of-shit who hid and died, and shot up in the Alleyway he&#39;d come to call home.&nbsp; But he simply wouldn&#39;t have been any more incorrect in the assumption.&nbsp; The coat alone was proof of that, supple, black leather, hanging just shy of the filth coated Alley-grounds.&nbsp; It was the square-toe, Italian loafers that convinced Tyrone, though, whose circulations had taken him to the stranger&#39;s feet.&nbsp; Looking up from his mad, mad, mad search, The Junkie&#39;s eyes met with the stranger&#39;s and Tyrone could barely hold back the whimper of fear in his throat.&nbsp; Thank Christ he&#39;d scored earlier in the week, and not been able to eat, or he&#39;d likely have shat himself as well.&nbsp; They were terrible, and whether it was a trick of the lighting, of the drugs still roiling through his system, or simply a glimpse into madness, Junkie Tyrone would never be able to guess.&nbsp; Flinching away from the well-dressed stranger, Tyrone&#39;s first instinct was the flee.&nbsp; Maybe South, even Sergei would give a better deal than the horrors he saw in the stranger&#39;s eyes.&nbsp; And in an instant flicker of movement, almost too fast for Tyrone to follow, a black gloved hand reached into a pocket, and wavered forward, shaking just enough to notice.&nbsp; The wind kicked up, brushing through the Alley with an icy-cold, and the bill in the Stranger&#39;s hand flapped in the current, like the forgotten pennant of some ancient Warrior-Chief, President Franklin stared out from the verdant confines of his paper frame.&nbsp; The Stranger&#39;s face was white as alabaster, starkly contrasting against the black of his buttoned trench, and gloves.&nbsp; What had at first seemed the face of the Devil himself, eyes as black as sin, and staring past Tyrone&#39;s soul, into the depths of his personage until they knew the hunger and pain he suffered through, and dragged them into the light, now, the Stranger was just another upper-class yuppy of Los Angeles.&nbsp; An upper-class yuppy, offering a hundred dollar handout.</p><p></p><p>Somehow he&#39;d lost time after that, it was a bit of a blur.&nbsp; In fact, mostly a blur.&nbsp; He could remember taking the bill from the Stranger&#39;s hand, and somehow the passing of that slip of paper had strengthened him, in some subtle way.&nbsp; Strengthened his body, but muddled his thoughts.&nbsp; He could remember the pain, the Itch.&nbsp; It was there, gnawing inside, but not the gnawing he&#39;d grown accustomed to, no this was a gnawing in the strings of his heart, it was wrong, wrong, wrong.&nbsp; But he couldn&#39;t help himself, he simply couldn&#39;t.&nbsp; Not even hearing about Armando&#39;s death, Armando who always kicked in an extra bit, for his really &#39;loyal&#39; customers.&nbsp; Armando who always let Tyrone nod out for an hour or two on his couch, shot fifteen times, between neck and nuts, when Sergei had figured he wanted that territory more than some spic kid wanted to live.&nbsp; Even when Carl, Armando&#39;s cousin, said, &quot;You know, Ty, I know this chick down in Hollywood who could hook a brother up nice and -fat-.&quot;<br /><br />So he&#39;d given in, and splurged, a Pack of smokes and a bus ticket later; Tyrone was in Hollywood.&nbsp; His works were carefully bundled up inside his underwear, the wind picked up again, blowing hard and cold-as-ice through the streets as Tyrone worked his way out of the semi-crowded bus.&nbsp; The press of bodies as he neared the front nearly made him gag, suddenly the thought of just touching another Human seemed to force his stomach up his throat, and with a supreme effort of will, Tyrone made it out and into the streets of Downtown Hollywood.&nbsp; Glancing up and down the street, he plunged ahead, tugging at the ratty, old coat, keeping it as tight to his body as he possibly could.&nbsp; And without a second glance, into the Alleyway between buildings, losing himself in the hidden backstreets of the city.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&#39;t actually very long or far he wandered before he found what he was looking for.&nbsp; She was huge, easily six foot, and that was as hunched and hidden as she was.&nbsp; A tan, trench coat, stained, fraying, and voluminous, hung around her, hiding much of her features, but the invasive smell of baby powder.&nbsp; Hearing the squish and crunch of his many times broken-and-repaired tennis shoes, she spun in place, turning to face Tyrone, and rising to her feet.&nbsp; Somehow, she&#39;d easily been Six feet tall, and that was without the nearly extra-meter of shin, and now standing, towered grotesquely over Tyrone.&nbsp; The smell, the blur, the burning, rushing, need of his itching.&nbsp; Unbidden, an ancient memory, seemingly from before the start of time, the scent of his mother, the feeling of her, holding him, so small in her arms.&nbsp; The taste of milk, as he latched on, and suckled greedily at the teat, milk rushing down his throat in a warm torrent.&nbsp; And the smell, of baby powder, overwhelming everything else.&nbsp; And suddenly, the taste of mother&#39;s milk on his tongue, a memory from the other side of a lifetime, replaced by curdled, and rotten, the acrid taste of milk left far too long, heated by the sun, and thickened.&nbsp; His eyes snapped open, and he stared into the eyes of Momma, and with the ecstasy of a heroine high, and the grotesque&#39;s nipple in his mouth, the thick, rancid milk from her teat sliding down his throat, he wanted to let go, to spit, and vomit, and purge it all from his system, to run screaming into the Hollywood night.<br /><br />Instead, Tyrone felt the last fluttering beat of his heart, and died.</p>"

Shine until the two become one

Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent son

Shine down upon the severed
Shine until the two become one

Divided I'm withering away
Divided I'm withering away

Shine down upon the many
Light our way

She's also HELLUV cool, has a similar sense of humor, and is a damned good floor manager.  Seriously, when the place is busy she's like a bee, just all over the place, when it's empty, she's delegating small tasks that need doing, and if those are done, just chilling with the shift crew.  I'm really stoked about working in general, I'm feeling really, well, proud of myself for finally landing a job.  Not only that but I like the work, it's not very hard, most of it is playing around with a database of movies and customers, and stocking shelves.  That and customer service.  I think I did good today, I kept forgetting to remind the customer when their movies were due.  But most of them were very nice, and were lenient with the new guy.  Only one woman seemed a little huffy, and I explained myself being a trainee and she seemed to chill a bit.  Plus theres perks, laughing at the porn titles, a free rental for every day I work, and as far as my schedule looks I'm working the mid-day shifts, which is fucking great.

"event","Oh Hell is it hard to sleep in a different time zone, real hard when your room is supposed to be a Suite, and of course, you expected American standard suites.

This is not an American standard suite.  It is very much so not, you see, the English have this concept of a Sutie being a Hotel room with an extra bed in it.  Somewhere.  Now the first place we stayed I lucked out on, I actually had my own room.  And of course by room I mean closet.  I'm not joking when I describe that room as a closet, because well...I could stand in the middle of it, and if I raised either of my hands to shoulder height, they would be touching the walls.

I had a window at least.  Which was nice and bad, the thing you have to remember, is, England is cold, and Scotland, which is Northern England, is FUCKING cold.  In the wee hours of the morning at least.  Besides that, the bed in my room was pushed up to the wall with the window, which meant I had a window sill about three inches above one side of my bed.  So...anyone who went walking by the window and looked in could actually watch me sleep.

Now mind you, we're in Nairn, a little Northern Scottish coast town.  According to the elderly locals Charlie Chaplin used to visit there because he wasn't famous in England.  I found this out the next morning, on a run to the store to get a magazine, as I incidentally sat down and started smoking while I was out.  (A recurring theme in my trip to Scotland was my leaving where I was at for the express purpose of smoking, and it happened alot in castles.)

I get back to the hotel, sit down, start reading my magazine.  Pretty uneventful.  We go to breakfast and BAM the dining room is full.  Wait a tic, wasn't the hotel like...empty when we showed up yesterday?  This is a sign of things to come, those fucking German bastards."

My box is running once more.

Thats right, I got a new hard drive.  This morning when I woke up my throat felt horrible.  I suppose going through an entire pack by myself in about six hours is a bad idea.  Of course, I like to think I was justified.  Holy fuck, I don't even want to smoke right now.  Except my body keeps telling me, ""SMOOOOOOKE!""

Shit.

Now to begin the task of recollecting my large amounts of (il)legal music files and other such things.  Ugh, this is gonna suck.  At least I have a book to read."

"event","In a room with no doors I will loose myself to you
In a room with blackened walls I'm coming trough
In a room in my house you'll be seeing it trough my eyes
It's a perpetual sin, let the ritual begin tonight

It's alright, can't you see
It's ok, she is with me
Like the sand of our time
Clovenhoof

Are you the one they say you are, are you holy to the bone
Have you got faith enough to throw the first stone
Are you my flame when only darkness prevails
Are you my white wale, the hammer for my nails tonight
</End lyrics>

I would be writing a poem, as that is good for you.  But, I'm in one of those modes where the only thing that could loosen up my imagination would be relaxing in the back and smoking a cigarette.  This however, is not going to happen, as I smoked my last yesterday.  Son of a bitch.  And the brewery, the lot of assholes, didn't even give me a fucking call.  Pricks.  I'm going to sue for unfair practices.  Fuck.  Just one of those agrivating nights.  I'll hang out with Jesse tomorrow, see what he's up to.  Been ignoring the injun for a bit anyways."

For what it's worth, your pain is mine.
And for how it ends, well it's up to you.
Because this pain won't let me go.

For how it lies, the chains still hold,
Now that the fire has died between you and I,
My flesh is lying unused and cold.
However it ends, the Lord shall take me.

My rule is my sin, it shall curse,
The shell of a warrior,
The soul of a Knight,
The heart of a man.

And though my closest of friends betrays,
My love for thee shall never fade,
And despite the curse of my loins,
My honor shall never be stained.

When the land of Briton's need is dire,
Seek not the Knights of hire,
For in the sky shall I stand,
And again protect my land."

"event","I spent all day with Emelyn and Tyler.  Holy fuck.

So, Em comes by and picks me up, we go get cigarettes and drive out to rhe Redwood cemetary to smoke, look Goth, try and find V:tM LARPers.  Now, we were disappointed on one count, but it's always interesting to look at names and engravings and epitaths and such on the graves.

Now, afterwards, we went down to Tyler's and found out he was at some math..thing...in Willits.  So, Em and I ask politely if we might perchance take use of Tyler's PS2 and wait there for him.  Proceed to 2 HOURS OF EM AND I PLAYING SAN ANDREAS, PLUS ANOTHER TWO HOUS OF EM, TYLER, AND I PLAYING IT.  My GOD that was the funnest shit EVAHR.  One bit we were playing two player, and we found ourselves a Crop duster, I promptly jumped in.  Tyler was lagging behind, jumped on the plane's wing and hoped for the best.  We got the worst, as soon as I took off he fell off.  Now, both the players have to be in sight of each other in San Andreas two player.  Hilarity ensued.  My plane just rolling down ahill in hiccups because Tyler's character is running to catch up.  So I'm laughing so hard I don't even seen the plane FALL INTO THE FREEWAY AND GO BOOM.  Much more laughing.

So, after, we hop over to Denny's and order up Cappacinoes.  These things ARE LIQUID WAFFLES.  I swear to almighty christ they are.  Anyways, we leave Denny's after three cups of cappacino, which explains why I'm very energetic right now.  Anyways, after Denny's we cruise over to Raley's and hang out outside at the pay phones trying to dial 1-800 phone sex numbers.  This was interesting, and then I told a dead baby joke to an operater. However, due to an insane ranting hobo we left.  While screaming, ""HOBO PRIDE!"" at him as we leave the parking lot.  After this whole thing we notice a band playing at the Brewery and an inordinate amount of wiggers hanging about outside.  For the next HOUR we stood outside watching some Soccer mom INSIDE FREAKING WITH SOCCER DAD.  Laughter was had by all.  And thats been my night."

I'm not happy anymore.  It seems like I just ride out these highs of whatever I'm doing and make people think I'm all crazy and energetic like and thats not me.  It might have been at one time, but it's not anymore.  And I suppose I am an attention whore, but really, at least I am both aware of it and try to keep myself in control like that.  I don't know...sometimes I wonder WHY I try to thrive in people's attention, and I have no fucking clue.  Only that I'm feeling really fucking lonely right now and fuck is my word crutch of the day.  I don't know, and thats whats confusing me,a nd I don't know what I want anymore.  I just want something.  It's like an itch you can't get to, you know it's there and it's somewhere in the middle of your back, but your arms aren't long enough so you can reach it and scratch.  I've retold what happened last night at the show so many times I don't think I care to anymore.

Just be assured, said show was fun.  I suppose.  I'm having a hard time right now feeling happy about anything.  And besides that, I'm fucking confused about what I want, only that I want, and haven't I been a good person?  I mean, haven't I tried to change myself from some insensitive prick that was an asshole to everyone?  I'm not the same person anymore, shouldn't I deserve some sort of happiness finally?  But no.  And people keep telling me, ""You're only a kid still, you have blah blah blah...""  And FUCK THEM.  I don't think I can stand it anymore.  I can't even go back through my old LJ entrys without fucking near crying.  I'm just so lonely now.  I could really go for a hug."

Don't let people get to you, and trust your instincts and heart.


And poetry!

It's the feeling of love in the back of your heart,
The sense of emotion in the front of your mind,
The amazing sight just past your eyeballs.
It's the touch of your toes in the front of your shoe,
The beginning of something new,
The idea of having fun with your friends that night.
It's the erection you get when you find yourself lusting,
And the wetness of your mouth when you are salivating.
It's the feeling you get in your fingertips,
When your lying on the stone cold and blind.
The rush of dope running through your body,
Infecting your blood, heart, your mind.

All and all, every, and nothing, all it all comes to is...

Everybody Wang Chung tonight."

"event","Yes, my cat is dead.  This actually happened Wednesday last week, but, pluh, I've been too preoccupied to comment on it.

Her name was Lucky.  I was maybe a year old when we got that cat.  Yes, the cat was 16 years old.  She lived a long full life for a cat with no tail.  Nope, no tail, couldn't tell you what happened to it.  In the end, old age caught up to her, she had a syst on her head, just about her eye, her teeth were rotting out and she was getting worse as time went by.  Eventually, after several days of not good lookingness, my parents took her into the vet.  Her kidneys were failing, one was shrunk down to the size of an apricot, and the other was swollen and enflamed, neither was working very much at all, so she wasn't having her body wastes or any such filtered.  My parents had her put down.

"event","It is the synapses in our brain which holds us back, paranoidly schizphrenic ideas of images and thoughts, illusions of independance in our bondage to the dark prison of a body.  A soul is just the crystal, the faceted rock, the guide, to the stars.  Can't you hear them?  The firings of cannons, and of howitzers and ICBM, and nuclear arms, and of all else?  They are the screams of the beloved slain by beloved, as the wailings of demons scream who feed on the flesh of fallen angels?  Nothing.  Bored.  I want a cigarette.  Or booze, something to kill me slowly but bring some sort of pleasant intoxication from reality, so I can finally just get away from all these thoughts and horrors floating in my head. You can hear my thoughts, can't you?  The thoughts that scream against the echoes of my mind, that rebound across the universe until God himself is deaf by the mere strength of such?  And by that deafness no longer hears the cries of even his choirs, who sing in bloodcurdled voices of the dgredation of the spirit.  The spirit?  Didn't I tell youb already?

IT IS JUST A CRYSTAL!  A GUIDE
DO NOT BE FOOLED BY LUCIFER, THE LIGHTBRINGER, BY THE MORNINGSTAR!  HE WHO IS DECEIVED IN LIFE AND ON EARTH IS DOOMED TO DIE IN PAIN IN TORMENT!

And I watched, as he broke the seventh seal, and lo, the waters turned as blood, and the sky turned as black as sackcloth.  And in that moment, humanity was revealed, and the nonsensical ramblings of the genius were known, and so was the Earth destroyed, insane, stricken upon as they stood masturbating to chimps in a cage, while the horsemen of War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death, rode, and underhoof, slaughtered what was left.  For that is all we are, is slaughter.

And now, your wisdom departs as your soul sinks, and your knowledge is raised, and your heart falls to the oblivion of nothingness, your eyes roll up past your head into the deep recesses of the galaxy, into the demensions with no names and ought but fire and daemons.  Your hands delve into her panties one last time, seeking that terrible bleeding gash, the one that begat you t6o begin with, and the great irony is revealed.  The disgusting rutting of pigs is what it is now, and the men who know nothing but that sex and neglect any honor to the lady, the ones who die, and in that death make me die inside everyday."

Not only that, but the content, though from fantasy, still has alot of meaning.  It's like the speech from the end of the Return of the King I mentioned sometime back, it means alot to me, even if it is just a story.  And to further quote the Lord of the Rings, it's the stories where they could have gone back many times, but they didn't.  They kept hanging on, because thats what was right, and it would save all that was right and good in the world.  Those are the stories that stay with you, that have a meaning."

"event","I bring you now, an interesting tale.

I was just reading Something Awful, the forums to be precise, and remembered an interesting story from a year or two ago.

One night, I woke up at about 3 AM with the extreme desire to releive myself.  So, I get up, run to the bathroom before my seemingly impacted colon ruptures, and take care of my business.  Now, this isn't so odd, as it has happened before, when I've eaten too much rich food, or just some sort of food that would cause such rectal distress.  Normally, I'll bring a book with me when I'm doing such duties.  It's a boring job to do, but it must be done, damnit!

Anyways, this time I didn't, now, usually trying to focus on the book would keep me awake.  So, there I am, releasing my internal bits to the watery grave they so richly deserve.  And obviously, I'm still tired as all hell.  Next thing I know, I'm huddled against my thigh and the wall, my leg is dead to the world, and my testicles are similar to a Penguins in warmth.  I look around for some sort of time telling device, ""6:00 AM""  it read.  Yes.  I spent half of my night sleeping on a toilet.  And the worst part is I had no clue what the fuck when I first awoke again, on said toilet."

[22:47] Paladin: Shreck's not a bad guy, and we get along pretty well, but not always, and the last weeks or two things have just gotten worse with us.  Theres alot of tension between the two of us.

[22:48] Paladin: Well, thats the idea, I frigured, because it's just about impossible to get Molly away from Shreck, I'd just sort of, be on my own for a few weeks and let the tension die down

"event","Shit.  I'm going to Scotland in July.  I'm graduating June.  I'm almost out of High School, then on to a job and college.

I got Paloma to do my nails today!  YaY  Black!  I can do it myself, I'm just retarded.  Now to master the art of using eyeliner, because I swear to God, I am one sexy bitch in makeup.  Yeah, things.  I think I came to the realization that I was letting Destiny lead me on.  She really was trying to, too.  Which is fucking lame.  It's such a horrible bitch thing to do, thats what bothers me, and I gave her alot more credit than to do something like that.  So, fuck it.  Anyways...

I'm thinking of putting the moves and such things on Olivia, I've known her for so very long and yet it never seemed to occur to me that we REALLY get along well.  Not only that but I think she's actually, dare I say it, mature enough to go for a long term relationship?  Something I've been trying to find for some time now?  The thing is, I don;t know if I'm fit boyfriend material for her.  I guess I'll have to find out on my own.

When people bitch about how they're horny to me I usually look at them like they're retarded.  I mean, people are talking about how it took them MONTHS to finally get to sex in a relationship...  As if thats a major fucking deal.  SEVENTEEN YEARS MOTHERFUCKERS, SEVENTEEN.  Can you imagine how backed up I am?  Pretty fucking badly.  But you know, I don't bitch about it much, because I'm not going to have sex.  Not until I find a girl I really love.  No, not marriage, that doesn't matter so badly to me really, but if I love the girl, then I'd do anything for her.  And thats the way it is.  Bitches."

"event","Something has come up in the last two days that has changed my sense of emotions and thoughts.  Last week I sent an email to Destiny, my ex long distance girlfriend.  I was with her for two years.  I really beleive she was the first girl to actually show me what true love is.  When we broke up I thought, ""Wow, this is the easiest breakup EVAR!""  But now, certain emotions are coming back up that I never felt before.  It just doesn't make sense to me, I thought I really was over her.

Yesterday she called me.  We talked, I was in the middle of a game of pool, with Molly and Shreck, so I sort of hurried myself off the phone.  But I called her back last night and talked with her until my phone battery died.  She and I spoke of alot of things, she mentioned breaking up with her current boyfriend, amongst other things.  And the thought that perplexed me was wether, if she did do said breaking up, I would really want to start a long distance relationship again, because yes, she did express some sort of interest in me again.  But as I spoke to her again this morning I realized, yes I would.  She ragged on me about smoking, and I admitted to her something I've never really told anyone, the reason I haven't quit is because I have no one I really care about enough to want my life to last any longer.  It seems odd that I would tell her something like that so easily.  She is quite possibly one of the few girls I've ever been able to talk about things with so easily.  I was just on the phone with her again, about twenty minutes ago.  

Until now it never really hit me, but it's like a truck catching that one pedestrian thats happily in his life crossing the street, something you never really ever see.  I don't know.  I really don't know, I think I still love her.  To be honest she was a model I held other girls up to, and I've been wondering, if I'd ever find the girl I was meant to be with.  And now I almost feel like I have the answer, to both whether, and who.  But theres a problem.  Her boyfriend, who doesn't treat her right, nor does it seem like they are doing too well anymore.  I find myself hoping almost it won't work, but really, I feel guilty.  I've had a girlfriend stolen, and that was horrible.  The worst of that was that it was by a friend.  I don't know anymore really, I'm just confused.

When I got off the phone I said, ""Hey Des, Sorry.""
""About what?""
""Good night.""
""Bye.""

I hope she doesn't worry about me."

So, Joey's looking for host families for Japanese school girls.  Yes.  I know, I'd host them myself if I could persuade the parents into it.  However, that is a no go.

As for myself, I was doing alright, earlier, then I went to the Star Wars club.  God, I'm a geek.  Anyways, Alex sat next to me in there, we watched the Star Wars Holiday Special.  Whee, except, I starting feeling all mopy and depressed about Alex again.  Earlier I took her out of my cell phone, and granted, that may have been a bad idea, as I might need her number again sometime later, but at least I don't have to see her name in my cell phone everytime I go through my phone book and feel that little pang.

The pang I mention is mostly regret.  As much as I try to tell myself it was only a very breif relationship, it still feels like I attached to her so much.  It's worse that I have to see her everyday, I think.  At least with Paloma I was for the most part over her when school started again.  The thing is, I beleive what hurts me the most is the idea that I had such high hopes for what we could have had together.  And to be honest, from what I've learned since, it seems like Alex is trying to find ""Mr. Right"".  You know, the cliche that when you find the one person your meant to be in it'll be like fireworks and you'll feel all this major emotion the first time you kiss.  All that sort of thing.  But, from what I've learned in life, that rarely or never happens.  I've never kissed a girl, or guy for that matter, and had fireworks go off, it's never happened.  I just wish I could actually sit down and talk to her about that.  Except I won't, because I know the impulse driving it is to try and win her back to me.  And that won't happen.  It won't happen, because she dumped me of her own volition, and  if theres nothing else I respect, it's the wishes of a lady.  I know that if I followed that impulse through it would simply be me attaching myself to her even more, trying to make her see me as someone truly important to her.

Meh, I need to wash my hair, the luxurious manlocks are in need of a good washing, and I feel like neither I nor others appreciate it enough anymore.  It seems odd, I was feeling all poopy like in Creative Writing, and was just sort of trying to ignore the horrible horrible movie and amuse myself by poking Mayra.  Yes, poking a Mexican.  The Texas sport.  Except they play with cattleprods in Texas.  And besides that, I really like Mayra.  I wouldn't shock her with a cattle prod.  That would be mean.

Now to figure out what I'll be doing for Prom, as it is coming up rather soon, and I don't want to go stag, nor do I just want to go with a friend.  I want to go with someone as my actual date.  Fuck."

"event","So, last night someone prank called my borhter's Cell phone.

I'll let that speak for itself in intelligence.  Anyways, with the phone number from caller ID my brother proceeded to look them up on Peoplefind.  Ooh, the fun we had, we now have their home phone number, house address, and their name.  So, armed with this and a glophone, one registered through New Jersey, a Glophone for those not in the know is an internet phone basically, you can register it through any area code in the country.  My brother and I had it registered through New Jersey, which means anyone calling us back would have to incur major phone debt for the long distance calls.  With our first line of defense in place, we setup a voice changer, set it to a more adult and authoritarian voice, and my brother leaves me to my work.  Meanwhile, he's sitting next to me clutching a pillow to his face to keep from laughing too loudly and thusly ruining the joke.

*Ring ring*
""Hello?""
""Hello sir, this is the Mendocino county Sheriff's department.""
""Uh...can I help you?""
""Yes, we have reports of prank phone calls from this number.  We've issued a juvenile warrant for the arrest of J.R. Vaughan at 1016 S. Dora Street.  A Deputy will be by to pick you up and take you in tonight.""
""Oh shit!.""
""Have a good night.""
*Click-ick*

Yes, I've had my vengance, however, my brother felt the need to continue things.  About Midnight another call was made, this time, the voice changer set to a female voice, and many a vulgar phone sex things were said.  I'd say I'm justified in this matter.

In other interesting news, my parents won a trip for two to Scotland.  Sweeeet.  It's next July, before I'm 18 damnit, but the idea right now is if my parents can't get it routed to another place, the trip that is, I'll get a cheap ticket over and a motel down the street from where my parents are staying."

I've been hanging out with Tom Ales the last two days, who is back from Texas, after 5 months.  It's been fun, but now that I'm home and alone, I feel sort of depressed.  I think this is exactley why I get hurt so badly after getting dumped.  I feel so very lonely, and it's like my heart is hungry for companionship.  The people I love always end up leaving me.  I'm so afraid that I'll end up alone, or something similar, and fuck.  I just feel odd and emo and poopy.  Tom got poon.  That fucker.  He sent ME into the Kwik Pick to get him a pack of condoms, because he's so fucking embarassed about it.  God."

"event","The pain has faded.  I did what I swore I would do, which is, I actually spoke with Alex about these excess feelings that I felt.  It seems now, that it's always too shameful for me to admit these things, but it's the only way I can actually start to heal.  It's like chemo, to an extent, the remedy is as destructive as the ailment.  At least, on an emotional level.  I don't think Alex realized how much it hurt me to have to explain my feelings to her like that.  I don't think anyone would realize it, they would simply see a solution to a problem, but theres the problem.

I explained to a few friends why I wear a bronze chain around my ankle.  When I bought this chain I counted the number of links it has.  It matches the number of oaths I have sworn that will last the rest of my life.  And...well, would you rather carry such a heavy burden on your heart, or on your ankle?"

"event","God...There are things you don't -Want- to know, but you just have to know.  I've had to hear about them from my ex's before, I felt like someone was wrenching a knife in my stomach.  I suppose thats what it's always like when you have to see someone you felt so strongly for, with another person.

I realized something, Alex mentioned it being awkward for a while but the two of us going back to how it was.  She doesn't realize that I can't.  What we had before, wasn't just me being friendly, I was flirting with her, I had an interest in her, I had the budding emotions that have blossomed and been plucked.  For things to be as they were between us, we would have to be together again.

Something else that's been bothering me has been something I would know quite a bit about.  When I was younger, and certainly less chivalrous than I am now, I had an intense, personal fear of having my heart broken.  This really only lead me to cause myself pain.  After a while I worked my way past it, I've been looking for a healthy relationship that I can build, and hold for a long time.  This, ties in with the strength of my emotions for Alex.  The thing is, I know what I told myself then, as well.  These were the same things I was told by Alex.  Does she realize, that by killing something so soon, when theres so much hope left, she truly is hurting me more, and herself, and not only that, but the reason why she's doing it is because she's afraid I'll break HER heart?  Of course, I'm no psychologist.  And all I have is speculation, and not a little bit of bias.  Still...It would be nice to know if I could help her.

It occurs to me, that all I've been doing is whining and bitching about how Alex dumped.  All week.  I feel like such a bad person, I honestly do.  I just...I dunno, maybe I'm living up to some lame Livejournal cliche.  

Worse news:  I got a cinch notice today.  I'm fucked."

"event","She didn't mean to hurt me like this.  It was never her intent to hurt me like this.  I know she intended to stop things before she got a chance to hurt me like this.  At least that was the idea of it, from what I understood.  But, dear God, do I wish that she would change her mind.  The problem is I can't let myself hope for that, or wish for that, or even contemplate that.  It won't end well, only with my being even more emotionally torn.  And...if I can't have her again, then I can't just see her around, not yet.  I have to deal with my emotions first, otherwise all that will happen is I'll simply keep caring for her, and if that happens, then I have to deal with watching her in other relationships, or anything else of the like, and I just can't beleive I'm capable of feeling that hatred and jealousy again.  I can't.  So what can I do?

I can speak with her about this, I don't want her to feel like I'm just trying to shunt her away because I hate her.  It hurts to see her now, smiling, laughing, it hurts me to know she's right there, and that I had her once.  It hurts me because I know theres nothing I can do now, only hope she comes to terms with her own problems, or changes her mind, or whatever she needs.  I hate it, I never liked being put down, not allowed my full potential, because something was in my way.  It brings out an animalistic fury in me, and through these years, I've fought it back.  It's like a beast waiting just below the surface, and I know, if I let it out, something bad will happen.  I can't seem to master my own rage, and the only times that rage comes about is when I simply have something all but in my grasp and lose it.  Or worse, have it in my grasp and lose it.  But I won't let my anger come out.  Not now, it has to be put aside, used for something that truly deserves it.

And Alex said she wouldn't have minded seeing me cry.  That's not why I can't let her see it.  I can't because I'm not strong enough.  I still feel shamed that Molly even saw me crying, and even then I was huddled against her, my hair hiding my face, and she didn't actually see it.

I can't sleep, because I'm afraid of my dreams.  I've gone through this before, dreams of someone I want, but can no longer have, dreams that make my heart break every time I'm awake.  I can't eat, because my chest feels numb.  I sometimes wonder if I still have a heartbeat.  She hugged me earlier, when she said she wouldn't mind seeing me crying, and I remember, before, when she was in my arms, I could feel my own heart beating, as well as hers.  Now all I could feel was the fluttering of her heart.  Before, it seemed odd, I couldn't cry, because I had felt so much despair, and so much sadness, and all of that cliche, gothy bullshit, and now, I've cried finally, and it doesn't seem like it's enough."

"event","Am I too proud to let her know I've been crying?  I'm sure she knows.  I'm sur she's looked at my Livejournal, that she knows what this has done to me.  The more I read what she sent to me, the more convinced I make myself that she's done what I dreamed she would do last night, that she decided against herself, that she truly wants to be with me.  But I don't want to beleive myself.  I've let myself have silly little hopes, naive dreams of some boy that thinks he's some sort of Knight.  I don't think I'm strong enough to let myself be broken again like that.  I don't think I could ever be strong enough to watch my hopes and my dreams crushed and torn, made into so much dust.  I want to beleive it, but I can't, I cannot, and I won't let myself.

Sometimes I wonder why, if I've had to feel so much emotional pain, I keep going.  And the only answer I can ever come up with is because my life isn't my own.  I don't think I could handle the responsibility of owning my life.  And all people need to know is that my life belongs to those I love, my friends, my family, the people I protect, the people I honor, the people I'll never leave behind.  It's an odd concept, to be sure, but it's kept me from totally despairing.  And it never seems as though people understand this about me.  Except Nikki.  I know she knows all about my beleif in the value of my own life.

You know, theres a really famous book, I beleive it's about feminism, but I'm not sure, called Atlas shrugged.  For those of you who don't understand, I'll spell it out.  Atlas, in Greek(?) mythology was the giant, who held the world upon his shoulders.  A great burden, to be sure, but sometimes, I'm not sure what triggers it, but I feel like I'm carrying the world on my shoulders, it's those times when I look truly tired, when my eyes are grey, rather than blue, when my hair is disheveled.  My honor wouldn't let me carry and lighter of a burden, I suppose."

"event","Alex sent me an email today.  It was a little set of lyrics, I think, or a short poem.  I haven't really even looked at her since she dumped me.  But, it was supposed to make me feel better I suppose.  I don't know.  Now that I'm finally past the emotional instability, or at least most of it, I just sort of feel numb, broken, and sick.  People keep trying to cheer me up and I can't stand it.  I can't even stand having my family around, or bothering me.  It just doesn't make me feel better, if anything it makes me want to slip even further.  I'm not sure if I'd welcome a comatose state right now or not."

"event","My mother told me, ""Theres plenty of other fish in the sea.""  So many people have told me this, or indirect variations of this.  And I hate it.  I hate fish.  People keep asking me wether I'm feeling better, etc.  And I can't stand to lie to my friends, so I have to tell them, ""No, I'm not feeling better.""  The only thing that has made me feel better is knowing I actually have friends to comfort me this time.  I just can't seem to build anything, with anyone, I want to have something with someone I can love.  Even if it does fall apart in the future, for once, I want something that will last longer than a few weeks."

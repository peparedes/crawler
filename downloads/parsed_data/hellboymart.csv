"event","Alison kissed a guy in Prague. I knew she would.

You think you know someone and you don't. I feel a little betrayed, it's my birthday, she lied to me. I told her that I can never talk to her again, she doesn't care, all she cares about is whether or not I hate her. She has really moved on. I moved on too, but it still kinda hurts how I wasted 4 years of my life and the thing just fucking died.

Life goes on. It was nice knowing her, she was a beautiful person with an amazing mind and a beautiful heart. I will never know anyone like her again in my lifetime.

Time to write:

I'm 25 today, right now and it feels like I am hanging from a tree, so many dreams pulling at my heart so tainted and bruised, and i believed in your soul, i trusted your heart, everything you told me was a lie, you knew deep inside that you would fuck me, you knew you would leave me in the end, i can't blame you anymore, but i cannot look in you the eyes, because there is nothing there anymore, and how do i pull myself back, starting again and i'm far to lazy, and far to dead inside, yet this drive within pushes me away from you know what, and i am so confused, where do i go, what to do, how can i ever trust someone again, how can i ever trully live again, i told myself so many times, convinced myself so many times, of your sincerity, of your honesty, and you dragged me through the fucking mud once to often, and now i have to sever you, you claimed love like it's defualt and impregnable, if I could rip my skin and cut off your scar i would, it just kills me to lose what i thought was my best friend, my faveorite person. You are dead to me, and it kills me.

And another friendship goes down the shitter. R.I.P.

Some people would read this and say I am not over her, well I am, but it still hurts because she fucking lied to me and this has been one big fat delayed reaction that I have kept hidden within me. I don't love her anymore, and I have moved on but for her to not give a fucking shit about me (all she cares about is whether i hate her on not, not the fact that i am cutting her off) like that just hurts, plain and simple. 

Happy fucking 25th you piece of shit. And my all-time greatest and truest motto of all time never ceases to fail or amaze me: EVERYBODY GOES AWAY IN THE END.

Fuck all of you, do it now and save me the pain of looking back and thinking about how much fucking time I wasted investing in you. Who's next?"

"event","Here's a thought. I could just go balls-out on this, tell the complete truth and then invite everyone to read the sewage. Naaaah. 

Heh, a certain someone does not know that I read their journal and now I know what a liar and a slut they are, but that's okay, I kinda figured that anyways.

Alison is in Prague, our only communication is text messeges.

Susanne is hot. - See and now she is going to read this.

"event","For the past week I have been living online. I put myself on ""Hot or Not"" and I've made a few friends out of it, albeit online ones. I'm planning a trip to California ""The Sunshine State"" in a few months, maybe even as soon as uh July. - Stupidass journal, there is no point to this. Besides, I can't be HONEST on this thing, I don't know who is reading it. I heard that the FBI reads blogs and online journals now. They probably have keyword spider bots that find out if Yassaf in Arizona is buying five hundred pounds of fertilizer and the next day he's busted. So I can't really tell everyone about what I did today etc. What if one of my friends reads it and finds out that I secretly hate them or want their girl or any of that crap? I'm screwed then. 

On a lighter note, Alison is going to Prague today at 3pm for a week with Jo. We have talked EVERY night for years, a whole week of not talking, though she reckons she's gonna call me on my birthday. BLAH.

All my friends want to take me out on my birthday and do cool things but i really don't give a shit about it.

I'm such a mess right now, yet I'm not, I don't know what's going on, I'm living in a fucking dream world. 

Fuck it."

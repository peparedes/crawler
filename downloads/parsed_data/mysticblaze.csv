"event","My hair is turning gray.  Actually, the new hair coming in is stark white and once my whole head is that color it's going to be striking.  Unfortunately based on my genetics and how my mother's hair is turning gray, I won't have that pure white color until I reach my 70s at the very minimum.  My mother is one year shy of 60 and she is sporting the salt and pepper look with quite a bit of pepper still showing, although it does turn saltier by the year.

Up until recently I plucked the offending strands out.  When they were few and far in between this was a quick process but it has become more tedious in the past couple of years.  Not knowing exactly where the white hairs were coming in I decided to let them grow in a month ago out of curiosity.  Now I can see that I am developing a white stripe in the middle of my head, giving me a potential skunk look.  It is amusing but probably too distracting for my professional life.

I don't feel like plucking anymore, so I have decided it's time to color my hair.  The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of doing so naturally and as such I have been doing some research.  Apparently there is a way for brunettes to darken their gray hairs with a sage or rosemary tea rinse that must be repeated every week, and the color changes gradually on the gray hairs while darkening those strands that still have color.  There is also the idea of henna, although it looks like the application process is quite messy.  Once the henna is applied and you have the color you want, it looks like it requires root touch ups every once in a while.  The henna apparently conditions the hair as well.

Considering that I don't want to take more time than necessary to deal with this issue on a regular basis I am going to try henna on my hair this weekend.  In particular, I am contemplating using Lush's Caca Brun, which I think will give me a color that will not be too far off my original.  It's going to be a messy adventure but hopefully it will work out well."

Too bad that there isn't an app for posting on LJ as there is for wordpress.  I might actually update more when I'm not by my computer.  I expect that my other blog could get more of my attention, psrticularly once I find my camera.  Not sure where I packed it when we moved.

Our current plan is to continue to explore the Nordic countries, ie Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia and Lithuania.  We are considering a trip to Iceland in February, trading the warmth of our prior winter vacations for cold weather and a new locale (new to me anyway, Than has traveled to Iceland before), but we have also discussed traveling to the UK together (we have been there separately) or to Canada (Montreal or Quebec).  At some point we would also like to hit some of the other proposed honeymoon locations (Turkey and South Africa particularly) but we are concentrating in the northern part of the world first.

Also, this isn't the best map.  It doesn't show Bermuda or any of my travels through the Caribbean (in order: Barbados, Puerto Rico, British Virgin Islands, Aruba, Jamaica or Bahamas).

To one and all:
If you are not feeling well, DO NOT get on the subway.  If you are on the subway and start getting sick, GET OFF the train!  

If you do this, help will get to you faster just like the posters promise.

As a result of your stupidity you have caused major delays on the 5 line.  For me that meant waiting for and getting on a local 2 train so now you have made my commute half an hour longer than it should be.

I would be more sympathetic if this weren't the third time that this has happened this year.

As I have been typing this, an express train just passed us, and yet I am stuck on the local.  I assume this means that they finally removed the person that caused the delay.

This is not a good start to the day."

"event","One of the nice aspects regarding our current apartment is that we are able to maintain a container garden.  It isn't much at the moment, but we have plans to buy bulbs in the fall and grow flowering plants, herbs and vegetables next year during spring, summer and fall.  I figured that I should document its beginnings for future reference.

Here is a view of the front door of our apartment.  The container garden surrounds our entrance:

<center><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/2806609210_56491e4f81.jpg?v=0"" alt=""Container Garden"" /></center>

For flowering plants we have two unidentified annuals, one with pink small flowers and the other with red and ""alien-looking"" leaves, as well as seven chrysanthemums (two white, two violet and three burgundy) and an ornamental pepper (that is not edible, thus I am including it in this category).  We started with six asters but they didn't survive too long after they flowered.  Our herbs are increasing in number on a daily basis (as we find them) and now include three basil plants, one oregano, two curly parsleys, two rosemaries, one mint, and we are growing dill, chives, thyme and sage from seeds.  Even though we started late in the season, our vegetables include two different types of tomato plants, one jalapeno and one cayenne pepper.  To guard the garden we have retained the services of Basil the Gnome:

We will be watching the weather constantly from this point forward, since we plan to bring the herbs and peppers inside before the first frost.  We do not know whether the tomatoes or the chrysanthemums will return next year even though the latter are perennials, but they can always be replaced with a trip to Home Depot (where the majority of our established plants came from) or one of the local nurseries (closest ones are in New Rochelle).

Now, if I can find some chamomile and peppermint to make tea and lavender to make scented satchets like the ones my grandmother used to make..."

"event","<b>The Opening Ceremonies</b>
<u>Loved:</u>

Watching the Opening Ceremonies at Zach's place on his 46 in HD DLP TV.  He kept me company even when Than and his friend Seth fell asleep.  Exchanging commentary was fun.

The artistic portion of the Opening Ceremonies.  So many performers coming together to give a flawless and precise presentation.  The imagery was breathtaking.

Learning that there are so many countries that I had never heard of.  That the parade of countries did not take place in the traditional alphabetical order, but according to the number of strokes in the Chinese character that represents the name of each country.  For once the Australians had to wait to close to the end to enter the stadium.

Five of the flag bearers were sailors. 

The torch lighting.  I am in awe of the Li Ning and the core strength that it took to run in the air around the stadium before the lighting.

<u>Hated:</u>

The number of people protesting the fact that the Olympics are being held in Beijing.  The decision was made eight years ago by the IOC and never rescinded, get over it people.

The gang signs made by some members of the US Olympic team when the cameras were focused on them.  Was that really necessary?

The fact that Puerto Rico and Palestine had their own delegations.  Neither is a country, the former is a part of the US, considered a Commonwealth, and the latter has yet to be recognized by the United Nations as an independent nation (as I recall from my International Law class).

NBC coverage of the parade of nations.  Going to commercial when small delegations were marching and then barely giving them coverage is extremely rude.  For many of them the parade is the only time that they get to shine and to be seen by their countrymen.  There was a comment made that the Cayman Islands, which normally follows Canada alphabetically wrote to the producers at NBC to request that the commercial take place after they march so that they could be seen at home, unlike what happened in the 2004 Olympics.  

Some of the outfits worn by the delegations.  Did Spain really have to dress its men like red chili peppers and its women like bananas?  What was the reason behind the white dresses with red flowers worn by the Hungarian women?  Also, everyone knows that Ralph Lauren designed the outfits for the US team.  Did his logo have to be as large if not larger than the team logo?

Some of the lame commentary.  No need to say more on this topic, since this is a perennial complaint of mine.

<b>The Olympic Coverage</b>
<u>Love:</u>

The 24/7 coverage of the games, some in real time on the many networks.  Who would think to look for Olympic coverage on USA, Telemundo or Oxygen?

The variety of coverage that is being shown.  Day one included shooting, fencing, rowing, beach volleyball, women's volleyball, women's soccer (saw the majority of the China-Canada match), men's gymnastics, swimming...  Watching boxing on day two at the moment.

<u>Hate:</u>

There was a full day of sailing events and not a single bit of coverage on any of the networks.  In fact, checking the TV schedule for the Olympics shows that there isn't a single slot devoted to sailing for the duration.  Didn't see any time devoted to Rhythmic Gymnastics either.  What gives?  Simply because the US doesn't do well in those sports in general doesn't mean that they shouldn't be covered.  NBC will be getting my letter of complaint in the very near future.

Preliminary heats in many events are not shown unless there are Americans participating.  Not many athletes make it to the Olympics, why not honor those that did simply by showing them during the coverage?"

"event","My office smells like cigarette smoke and it is coming from the vents above us.  In fact, the whole back of our office is getting progressively smellier even though none of our staff or attorneys are smoking.  We have been dealing with this smell in the women's bathroom since the new company moved in across the hallway a few months ago, however this is the first time that it is invading our space.

KMS and I just returned from the new company, where they swear that there is no one smoking.  Their air smells clean, so it's hard not to believe them...  yet you can smell it in the hallway as well.  A couple members of our staff have seen an older woman with gray hair smoking in the bathroom in the recent past, but they claim that there is only one woman working for them, and she is young and just had surgery.  She blames it on men smoking in their bathroom, however when we walk by there the smoke smell is nonexistent.

I am really annoyed because this is probably going to cause an asthma attack.  I have already spoken with the building management, and they say that there is nothing that can be done.  The only solution that I can think of is to close off the air conditioning vents and hope for the best.

If I choose to go to an establishment where smoking is permitted, I do so at my own risk.  I don't choose to work in a smoke filled environment, so I should not be smelling it right now."

"event","That show is such a guilty pleasure.  I enjoyed every second of last season and waited to see what would happen when Mario, Joey and Emmitt broke the rules and what Jerry's latest gimmick would be (smashing the guitar didn't work out so well for him but his samba with the maracas was awesome because it had so much personality)

I am enjoying this season even more.  Everyone is trying their best, and that makes for great competition.  I didn't think that Billy Ray would improve from last week, but his quickstep seemed inspired once he and Karina started moving.  I was quite impressed.  I enjoyed Laila's performance the most, but Joey, Apolo and Heather were also really good and portrayed the mood of the dances well.  John's performance, although not perfect, was charming and full of character.  My least favorite performance was Shandi's- she was so stiff in her mambo that it was a bit painful to watch.  But that is a minor complaint, since it was technically a good mambo.

Than and I have entered a pool at his school on the show.  They picked our dancers randomly last week, and we got Ian and Apolo.  I think we'll get far and may win some money in the process.

For the record- I think Shandi should be the first celebrity kicked off.  I have voted accordingly."

By BRIAN J. HOWARD
(Original publication: January 8, 2007)

A motorcyclist was killed yesterday in what appears to have been a single-vehicle crash on the Cross County Parkway in Mount Vernon.

Accident investigators were still working to determine what caused a 2005 Harley-Davidson ridden by Kenneth G. McCallum, 43, of 811 Van Nest Ave. in the Bronx, to crash on the westbound Cross County Parkway near North Columbus Avenue around 11:40 a.m. yesterday. The Parkway curves sharply to the north at that point just east of the Hutchinson River Parkway.

""It appears that the victim failed to negotiate the turn, hit the center median and sustained injuries,"" Westchester County police Lt. Henry Cetina said.

A STAT Flight helicopter landed on the parkway and transported the victim to Westchester Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:45 p.m. The exact cause of death has not yet been released.

Westchester County Police, Eastchester and Mount Vernon emergency medical crews and Mount Vernon firefighters responded to the scene.

The parkway was closed westbound at New Rochelle Road for several hours following the accident, and traffic was diverted by police onto the Hutchinson River Parkway. The parkway entrance from the southbound Hutchinson Parkway was also closed. Police ask anyone who witnessed the accident to call 914-864-7700.</i></lj-cut>"

<i><b>Cincinnati 13, Baltimore 7</b>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
December 1, 2006

CINCINNATI (AP) -- Playing with a chance to win a title, the Baltimore Ravens crossed midfield once in the first three quarters. Their fearsome defense got caught flat-footed by a sandlot play.

Maybe T.J. Houshmandzadeh is right after all.

Houshmandzadeh caught a 40-yard touchdown pass on a flea-flicker Thursday night, sparking the Cincinnati Bengals to a 13-7 victory that kept the AFC North title up for grabs.

""It's huge,"" quarterback Carson Palmer said. ""We're rolling now. Hopefully we'll wind up getting a spot in the playoffs.""

A surprisingly stout Bengals defense is keeping them in contention.

Coming off a 30-0 shutout in Cleveland, one of the NFL's lowest-ranked defenses held Baltimore (9-3) scoreless until Steve McNair threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason with 1:01 to play.

Even though it missed out on a second straight shutout, the defense did something that no other Cincinnati unit has done: go seven straight quarters without allowing a point.

""We've put a couple of complete games together,"" coach Marvin Lewis said.

The Ravens had won five in a row and were coming off their most complete game of the season, a 27-0 victory over Pittsburgh. With a chance to win the AFC North title outright, Baltimore's offense came apart, crossing midfield only once in the first three quarters. Keiwan Ratliff clinched it by recovering the onside kick after Baltimore's late score.

""It's a lost opportunity,"" tight end Todd Heap. said. ""We had a chance to come in here and win the division. Give them some credit. A lot of things went their way tonight. We just never got in the groove.""

All of it supported Houshmandzadeh's main point: Right now, Cincinnati (7-5) just might be the better team.

""I still feel the same way,"" he said.

After the Ravens won 26-20 on Nov. 5, the long-haired receiver insisted that everyone knows the Bengals are better. He repeated it again this week, getting a rise out of some of the Ravens. Safety Ed Reed suggested that Houshmandzadeh should just shut up.

The Ravens were in no position to argue after Houshmandzadeh caught 10 passes for a season-high 106 yards, including the trick-play touchdown that made it 13-0 early in the second half and allowed the defense to dig in on a rainy night.

""I thought we played great in every area tonight,"" Palmer said. ""They didn't do a whole lot different. We just played better.""

So, did the win prove that Cincinnati is better?

""In a sense,"" said Bengals receiver Chad Johnson, who had eight catches for 91 yards. ""We're 1-1. We'll see who's the better team if we have to face them again in the playoffs.""

The Ravens would love it.

""I'd play them every day of the week,"" linebacker Bart Scott said. ""We missed an opportunity, but our destiny is still in our hands. We might see them again. We might not.""

The Bengals don't usually resort to trick plays -- their offense has enough firepower to beat teams straight-up. They did something different against one of the league's nastiest defenses.

On their first drive of the second half, Palmer handed off to Rudi Johnson, who then flipped the ball back to him. Houshmandzadeh was well beyond the coverage when Palmer let fly with the flea-flicker pass.

Reed was the only player close to Houshmandzadeh when he caught the ball at the 12-yard line and ran untouched into the end zone.

Palmer had a solid showing against a defense that led the league in interceptions, ranked second in sacks and was third in points allowed. The Ravens rarely got to Palmer, who was on the mark on a rainy night -- 21-of-32 for 234 yards with only two sacks.

More stunning was the Bengals' defense.

Cincinnati's defense plummeted to last in the league rankings after giving up 42 second-half points to San Diego and nearly 600 yards to New Orleans. The defense got itself straightened out during the shutout in Cleveland, its first in 17 years.

It was even more impressive against Baltimore.

Baltimore crossed midfield only in the first half, and came away empty when Matt Stover missed a 29-yard field goal in the closing seconds. He made the kick on his first try, but the Bengals strategically called timeout just before the snap.

On the second try, holder Sam Koch struggled with a bad snap and the kick went to the left, only Stover's second miss in 21 tries this season.

The Ravens knew then that it wasn't their day.

By contrast, Shayne Graham connected from 23 and 27 yards in the first half, giving the Bengals an early lead and a chance to relax.

Baltimore played the second half without returner B.J. Sams, who broke the fibula in his lower right leg while returning the kickoff. His right foot twisted awkwardly, and he was taken off the field on a cart with his right ankle in a protective brace.

Notes

Ravens FB Justin Green hurt his right ankle in the third quarter and didn't return. ... Bengals second-string center Eric Ghiaciuc sprained his right knee late in the first half and didn't return. Center Ben Wilkerson made his NFL debut in the second half. ... Palmer's passer rating was 97.7, ending his streak of three straight games above 120.</lj-cut>

Is the Bengals' defense really starting to come together?  One can only hope..."

"event","I have finally finished moving into my apartment.  Everything is unpacked and put away, with the exception of a gym bag with office stuff that I have to sort through.

I am utterly exhausted, but the disaster area was driving me crazy.  Now I am at peace enjoying the extra space that I have gained by getting rid of boxes and stuffing as much as possible into the closets.  It isn't a surprise that they are quite full.

Now for a nap before getting ready for work."

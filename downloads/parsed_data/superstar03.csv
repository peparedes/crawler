I've felt closer to him and lighter and I feel like I can ask him anything or talk to him about whatever is on my mind. THis is how it should have been, but wasn't. I'm glad that we are doing well.
in other news. I leave for europe in 19 days. I'm so freaking nervous. Oh my god, I'm freaking out. I just know that something is going to go wrong or we're going to miss a flight or something crazy. I guess I freak out every single time but still, this is the first non academic outside of the country trip I've been on, and me and my friends have planned it all, so if it goes wrong there is nobody to blame but myself."

"event","RELATIONSHIP DRAMA

So Shaun and I broke up for a day and then got back together. This all started over a phone bill. Our bill was forty dollars more than it is every other month so I looked at my portion to see who I was calling and texting so much. Wasn't my problem. 120 ish pages of our 167 page phone bill were all text messages on his part. They were all to the same two numbers.. all day everyday he was texting these two numbers. I found out that one was his friend ashley from work and the other was some girl mai he knows that lives in cleveland. I am not a jealous or insecure girlfriend, I do not mind that he has friends that are girls because I have friends that are boys. A healthy relationship does not soley consist of eachother.. it involves friends of both sexes. And I know and accept that. But he was calling these numbers at like 4 in the morning while he was at work and talking for like 30 minutes. and then calling them again when I thought he was sleeping, or after he left my house.  At one point he talked to his friend in cleveland for 70 minutes. I never thought he was cheating on me and he wasn't because he is a good person. It just shined a light on the fact that he was talking to them more than he was talking to me. It really hurt my feelings and offended me, it also opened up a can of worms. We got into all the things that were bothering us and we never told eachother, which is not a good part of a relationship. So we talked everything out and I said that while we were working on our problems it would really make me feel a lot better if he wouldn't talk to the girl in cleveland. (eventhough i know they are just friends)I asked him to cut back on texting because that's what he went over on and why our phone bill was so expensive. I can't ask him to stop talking to his friend ashley from work because they work together it's not like I can say just don't look at any other girl, that would be crazy.
It still hurt my feelings. He felt like he couldn't talk about things with me because he though that I wouldn't care. Which is something I need to work on. But I think it was inappropriate for him to be talking to these girls at the hours that he was talking to them, eventhough he works third shift and they may be awake at the times when he would be awake, and I may not. It felt weird to me, although he saw it differently. He didn't think there was anything wrong with it because he wasn't looking to cheat on me with any of them, it still made me really sad.
It also bothered me that one of the girls calls him every now and again when she gets drunk. I really don't think that's appropriate. I cannot deny that I have drunk dialed my friends, but they are usually of the same sex and the ones that weren't, were calls that I shouldn't have made because when you're not in your sound mind you really shouldn't be calling other people's boyfriends. I know that's probably not why she called but it just bothers me a little. anyways, we worked out things and I know it's not perfect but it's a start.
Plus we leave for europe soon and it's been tough on both of us trying to save up money and get everything ready.

THIS WEEKEND

one of the main things I asked Shaun to do was to give me more gestures. We don't have to buy eachother exepnsive things every day or anything like that just let eachother know that we're thinking about the other one or just do awesome and nice things for eachother. 
so this weekend on Friday after I worked a double Shaun and I went to a bar with Jeremy and Liz and had a good time listening to the band anddrinking and people watching, which was fun because it's something we don't often do. 
Last night after I worked a double again he came over and gave me some lillies (one of my favorite flowers) and took me downtown. We had coffee at Kaldi's then walked down the street to Vynl, a diner (a very nice... semi pretentious diner) and had some food. It had a really awesome atmosphere, so I would go back, but I would probably go back to have cocktails or something. Then we went to his apartment and made some more food (because the food at vynl, although good wasn't filling)
Then today Tina, Shaun and I went to the museum to see the Pirate exhibit. So this weekend was really cool.

I will be graduating in a little over a year in German Studies and Spanish with a Certificate in Business Spanish. taht will be exciting when i can't find a job. 
I will be traveling this summer to London, Berlin and Barcelona. WHich i am really excited about. It should be a flipping blast, with Shaun, Lacey and Clark.
Motion City Soundtrack really has it correct with their song ""the future freaks me out"" because seriuosly I'm a little panic-attacky lately with all the stuff that's been changin in my own life, my friends lives, the world etc. 
I found out another person from oak hills died. I hope his family is able to heal from such a tragic event.

"event","RULES: Each player of this game starts off with 10 weird things/habits/little known facts about yourself. People who get tagged need to write a blog of their own 10 weird habits/things/little known facts as well as state this rule clearly. At the end you need to choose 10 people to be tagged and list their names. No tag backs.. (If you've already been tagged, you're off the hook.)


1. My boyfriend calls me Monk. (from the TV show.) because I have what I call lazy OCD, it's not bad enough to make me rock back in forth in the corner. Things make me awkwardly uncomfortable like when things aren't in a straight line, or when people try on my shoes and then don't put them back in the right position, oh oh or when one pullstring on a sweatshirt/shoestring isn't at the exact level as the other. And I always ALWAYS have to eat everything in a specific order, counting how many bites of each thing I've had and how many swallows of drink I can have.  

2. When I'm tired i speak a combination of German/Spanish/American/Jamie that isn't highly understood unless one knows all four languages. 

3. I chose my ringtone because it sounds like a rave. When it starts ringing there is a part where it's just an escalating noise and during that noise i say ""AAAAAAAANNNDDDD.... RAVE!"" and once the music hits my boyfriend and i dance around rave/glowstick style while saying ""UNS UNS UNS"".. you know, the rave sound.

4. I was handed a card by a drunk german in Munich that said  (and i'm translating here) ""i am looking for an American woman to dominate me. if you know anyone who wants to be worshipped please let me know so that i may marry her. I kiss feet"" Fortunately for everyone involved we all had boyfriends so we just laughed the card away and tried to shake drunky mcgermanson off.

5. I used to play in oil pits with my friends tina mandy and carly. i also used to throw mud at our apartment buildings. 


6. One time at UC my friend Michael made me laugh so hard I peed myself a little. But i never told him because that's embarassing. so instead i posted it on here so that everyone could know.

7. Everytime I try to skip class I wind up walking straight into my teacher. Literally. Every time.

8. People think I look like Molly Shannon. One time a guy came up to me and said ""could you just do me one favor."" I almost whipped out my Matrix-ocity on him but then he said ""could you put your hands in your armpits and then sniff them loudly"" so i did. and everyone laughed. I should join the circus.

9. I don't believe in soulmates. 

10. I love watching foreign movies. 

and this is supposedly the part where i tag people.
i don't know how to do that so i'll say their names
tina funk
joie bucalo
laura bingle
christina dole
mandy funk

"event","wow it's been awhile. so far all i've done is start school and keep working a the big Rosa's. 
my boyfriend had a fight the other day. and then we stopped fighting and decided to do something about it. i'm pretty sure it stems from neither of us having any money to do anything nice for the other. but that's ok. i know we'll get out of the rut. in december it will be 2 and a half years. damn that's a long time. i wonder what we'll do for our three year anniversary. i kinda felt bad this year because i was leaving for germany and we didn't get to spend much time with eachother on our anniversary. but this year hopefully will be different. hopefully i am not out of the country on that day. here are my options for this summer
scotland with lacey, shaun and clark for the harry potter premier + mexico with church
or
queretaro, mexico for six weeks taking a class
or
salamanca, spain for 5 weeks taking a class

i miss germany

why do we celebrate columbus day? 

the other day mandy brought leigha to school and i hung out with them for a spell. it was great. leigha grows up more everytime isee her. she's beautiful. if i knew how to post a picture i would. i think she finally recognizes me because she doesn't see me everyday but this time i saw her and she started laughing. it made me feel really good. i want a kid.

i met this girl in my spanish class who is from the ukraine originally and it was really cool. I feel bad for people who meet me sometimes when they are from other countries because i like to pump them with questions. I love meeting people from other countries and other cultures. I went to ""white suburbia school"" for high school where there wasn't a whole lot of diversity. a million kids but nto a lot of diversity, so now at college i have a milllion questions when i meet new people. luckily she wasn't offended or anything. This girl i work with at larosa's, her family is actually from Gana and i asked her a million questions too, haha she said that if an american were to go to gana the people there would be doing exactly what i was doing to her and asking her all kinds of stuff and she said they would be like ""wooooaaah your from america? really?!""

"event","Yesterday I went to the Gap Outlet in Hebron, KY. i was taking Shaun there for his first outlet experience. I found some cute stuff to try on. little did i know i was about to be ROBBED BLIND!
I went into the dressing room and tried on my garments. I gave the lady my garments that i did not want and walked out of the dressing room. about 10 seconds later I realized that I had forgotten my purse in the dressing room. So i turned immediately around. I said, I left my purse in the room and the woman who helped me was walking out of the storage room with it in her hand. I guess she heard me say that i had left it. She handed it to me. It was open. and so was my change purse. my 80 dollars was missing. I flipped out. The dressing room attendant who gave me my purse said that a woman with blonde hair found the purse and that i should look for her. We frantically look around the store., and get a manager involved. well then this tall blonde had sandy brown hair and had a bunch of kids with her. then she changed into a sandy brown haired woman with two kids who was only a little taller than me. I'm not tall.
i didn't catch on that anything was amiss in her story until later reflection. 
as we are searching i realize that my boyfriend had abandoned me and was talking to the manager and the other dressing room attendent far away. so i left and the other girl went back to her job in the fitting room.
i join their conversation and realize that the dressing room attendent who made up this huge long story about some woman who stole my money (and also told me how low it was for someone to steal money out of someone else's purse) was actually carrying a fat wad of something in her back pocket. the other fitting room attendent said she saw no such woman and the manager checked the storage cameras to see if they could see anything.
we waited while she was checking. she came back and said that she sees her go back with my purse into the storage room and bend down with it.. looking all suspicious-like. but since she didn't see her actually take the money out of my purse that they can't do anything. she said i am welcome to call the police and they can actually do something. I decided i might as well try. i called some cop and he came over and i told him exactly how many 20's and 10's i had and he disappeared to the back of the store in the fitting room for about 20 minutes. he came back and said ""follow me ma'am"" we went outside and he handed me my 80 dollars! 
he said that the manager was in the back firing the girl who stole the money from my purse and apparently they didn't do a very thorough background check because she had done some serious time in a woman's institution and was wanted for escaping. when we left the cop was trying to get a warrant for her arrest. 
wow.
that was a crazy day.
so by all means watch your shit."

"event","Is this soley an American problem? Aer people this stupid in Europe? Canada? Mexico? Iceland?
Maybe it's just the fact that i'm stir crazy. maybe it's just Cincinnati but certain Phenomena have been taking place that really make me question what the fuck is going on inside the heads of Americans. 

Today on the way home from school i was slowing to stop at a stop light. Normal. I was probably going about 20mph when this occured:
A teenaged boy (about 17) and two younger girls ( probably about 10) were standing on the side of the rode. Without looking either way the seventeen year old stepped out and would have been hit by my car if he had not come out of whatever GOD FORSAKEN REVERIE that he had placed himself under. He also would have led the unfortunate 10 years to certain injury too. And then (as is the case with most teenagers in America) he glared at me like it was my fault. If i would have ever walked out in front of traffic like that my dad would have yelled at me so fast and so harsh you wouldn't know what hit you. IT was one of the first things i learned as a child. NEVER CROSS THE STREET WITHOUT LOOKING BOTH WAYS. TWICE. and this is saying something because i grew up on a farm in indiana. The closest street was a mile away.

this is just a tiny glimpse into what is going on in the American youth lately. They don't care about anything. They don't care about other people. they don't even care about themselves. We have become too lazy to even get off the damn couch to shut the tv off to notice. WHen i wa sin germany we ran across a self proclaimed anarchist. a bum. unshowevered. with his dog. Yet as we were talking to him we realized he spoke perfect english. and he knew more about the american goverment and it's policies than we did. I was ashamed of myself. HOw could this foreignor know (AND CARE) more about what is going on in my country than me and all of my friends? It's because the goverment has done nothing to stop it. they have encouraged our uninvolvement. They say they want us to vote. they say they want us to know. to understand. But when THEY present US with the candidates for lawmaking they leave us with little choice. they tell us who to vote for. The candidates (in my mind) are rarely ever different. Maybe they mean well. Maybe they even believe what they are saying. But nothing ever gets done. I guess it could be a bias because I am directly speaking of the currenct ""american regime"". I am sick of the laziness. I am sick of the lack of education. i am sick of the ignorance. I am sick of parents not teaching their children how to properly cross the street. I am sick of seeing 10 year olds dressed as prostitutes. i am then sick of wondering why we have pedophiles when we allow our children to dress like this. (i am also aware that this is not the only reason, i am not that ignorant)
 i am sick of the imigration laws because all of the ""illegal"" mexicans i know deserve every penny they have worked for and they work 4 times as hard as i ever have en my entire life, and they don't even keep it they give it to their families because that is what is important to them. i am sick of our nation being able to tell someone who they can and cannot marry. I am sick of this country taking away the rights of women. i am sick of the body image in today's media.
 i am sick of president bush and his war. that's right HIS war. i am sick of people killing other people. i am sick of children rotting in jail. i am sick of children's minds rotting in front of the television. i am sick of the bird flu epidemic.
which brings me to

ever notice that every few years we are stricken with some new unstoppable cureless biological phenomenon that we must ""prepare ourselves for""? West nile virus. Killer Bees. Avion Flu.  they are all the same. the government needs us to be afraid of these things because we will stand ""united"" behjnd their sole antidote to whatever horrors are out there. 
i am sick of it. 

dear american government,
I am on to you

but Germany is coming quick.
My 21 birthday is Tuesday. I'm having a party at the HOfbrauhaus. It's going to be jammin'
I've been having some problems with the boyfriend. not really problems but i feel like i've been pushing his buttons every time i get a chance. it's not his fault. I guess on some level i'm just trying to see what he finds ok and what he doesnt. i can't really explain it. like is it ok to talk about this or that etc. Sometimes i don't like the answers. maybe i should just be very honest with him. i think he is afraid of brash honesty because in the past every brash honest thing that was said ended the relationship. (in the case of the ex it would be she HONESTLY liked to lick vagina and didn't so much enjoy the cock) but i don't feel like me saying whatever is on my mind is a bad thing. i have no intention of breaking up with him. it's not so much even a specific thing. i feel like i have to be careful about what i say because it will hurt his feelings. i don't want to hurt his feelings. 
i could be being selfish. i am kinda ""in your face"" about things and i guess i could be forgetting about his feelings.i should try not to hurt his feelings i guess i can't just be ""me me me"" with everything i say.  i have found in our relationship that i am prone to forgetting that he is not psychic and dones't know what i'm thinking. poor guy. he's my first serious boyfriend so i have no comparison to say ""yeah i don't like when boys do this.. i like when boys do this""
umm... back to germany
I will be stayin in the pension in Munich, the London backpackers hostel in london and Isaacs hostel in Dublin.
So excited it's rediculous.
i've already 'PRACTICE PACKED' like 44444558 times. i love packing. 

today was mother's day. My mommy is great. I feel bad for all those years (aka puberty) when i took her for granted. I really tried to rebel against everything she said. i wasn't a bad kid or anything  but for some reason it was really easy for her to hurt my feelings. she would say ""i don't like it when you wear black"" so i would wear nothing but because i didn't understand that she wasn't judging  me by what i wore she was worried that i was depressed or something. I remember exasperated conversations when my parents would sit me down and say ""we've never had the chance to be a parent to a teenager""
I think i have grown up mentally so much. I now know that my parents aren't exactly as freakish as i thought they were. They are actually occasionally enjoyable to be around, and they are nice enough to let me stay in their house. I am also now thankful for them making me work at an early age. I'm not a spoiled brat. THey don't hand me anything. When i was 14 i had my first job. I made money to buy things. Now i buy my own gas, clothes, food and pay my own bills. i guess what i'm saying is.. maybe it's a good thing they aren't rich. I paid my way when i was 18 to go to germany because they didn't have any money to give me. I'm doing the same thing now except it's a little harder because it's a bigger expense.
what i'm saying is. Thank you mom.
and with this i also have to thank Diane Elkins for being my second mom

"event","I went to the Hofbrauhaus last night for Miranda's 21st birthday. It was a riot. IT was the best way to end this amazingly stressfull and weird week. Miranda's parents were dancing on the benches at our tables. Me and shaun and Joe were Ho-downing in the aisle ways. WHere else are you ENCOURAGED to stand on the benches, dance like a crazy person, and be loud and obnoxious. It was amazing. I'm pretty sure Miranda's parents drank a keg each. MY voice hurts a little because we kept screaming!

I would suggest everyone have a birthday party their. Or at least go on a Friday night when everyone is loud and riotous. 

Well kids, tomorrow the easter bunny comes.

"event","Kim's funeral was tonight. It felt weird. We pulled into the parking lot and I saw so many familiar faces, some people I didn't know. Some people I knew. I hugged Erin Walsh and some people were telling a couple of Kim stories. I walked in and realized it was the same funeral home that my grandpa's funeral was held at. 
Standing in line, we noticed a board full of pictures of Kim and her friends. I was ok looking at them until I saw one of Me, Kim, Allison, Krystal after an orchestra concert. And then I started to well up because it for some reason hit me that this funeral was for someone that I know. She was a part of my life at one point. We hung out. We talked. We laughed. 
And I was ok until Shana Wahl hugged me. I saw her approaching me and for some reason when she said ""you ok?"" and hugged me I lost it. I think it was because she was the one who told me about when Kim died.
After I saw her in the casket I was just sitting there thinking about how we REALLY AREN'T GAURENTEED TOMMORROW. I know people say that the deceased don't really look like who they really are. And it's true. That wasn't Kim. Kim was already gone, that was just the vessel Kim used to touch our lives.
I ran into Frau Schott. I ran into Doug Schmaltz. I ran into Jon Meyer. David THielen. Brad Braunstein. Amanda Devoto. Harry Zen. Amber THornes.
These are people that I should see more often. I hate that it was a reunion. I hate that we had to see eachother at a funeral. 
I felt awkward. After getting so upset a bunch of us stood outside and we bullshitted about life and what we were up to and talked and reminisced. It felt so weird to laugh when I had just seen my friend in a casket. But, I don't really think Kim would have liked to see all of her friends puffy eyed and in mourning. At one point A couple of people came out of the funeral home and stood outside sobbing. I felt like such an intruder because we were standing so close. Because, we were still laughing and carrying on I suggested we move away, so that the sobbing people could have space and i didn't want our laughter to mock the hugeness of what was going on.

"event","somebody just called me and told me that one of my friends from high school is dead. Kim Freeman. I haven't seen her in so long. I talked to her everyday in classes. We had German exchange students together, and i have a whole page dedicated to her in my senior memory book. She is such a good person, i can't belieive something like this could happen to someone my age. She is one of the most genuine people i have ever met in my life. Was. 
I'll never forget how nice and caring and funny she was. Everyday she made up a new song about me in orchestra and would sing it to me. It always made me laugh.
If this is how bad I feel, I can't imagine what her family and close friends are going through.
Rip Kim. I love you."

just kidding. I live here and it's rent free so i should probably help out. But i would much rather go to target and buy my bathingsuit and then go to a tanning bed to buy a tanning package. (i don't want to be the translucent shade of caucasian that i am now, in Germany.) and besides, doesn't being tan make you look a little slimmer? or maybe i'm making things up.

i'm kinda freaking out. I have to pay $1250 on April 17 for Germany. and i have right now.... 560. eek! i guess i will have to take out a loan for the rest. 

I don't know if anyone watches the show Lost. But shaun and i are officially addicted to it. I downloaded BearShare just so i could download the second season episodes and catch up.

I'm so sure that if i ever met him i would vomit all over myself because i would get so worked up and give myself a stomache ache. This is why celebrities and normal people are kept separate.

"event","Well today lacey and i are going to do a picnic thing. It's amazing outside. OK. Call me crazy but i added to my list of things to do this summer. Once i get back from Munich, Dublin and london I will have two months before I go back to germany to take another class before school starts. This one is in Berlin. It only lasts ten days but I'm very excited. Hopefully i'll be able to go. Don't really know. I just filled out the application yesterday. 

I ran into Herrn Schade the other day. I was really nervous about taking his class last quarter but when i showed up he turned out to be really really cool. I ran into him the other day and he told me i did really well and he was really pleased with my work. he said ""i knew everyday that you were on the ball"" I didn't know what to say. 

What do you say when someone like Herr Schade complimients you? I was like THANKS! It really meant a lot to me.  

He represents this region of the United Sates, in Germany. When anyone in this ""region"" needs something or needs representation in Germany he does it for them. He knows, like EVERYTHING. 

During the Olympics in the 80's the olympic council called him to see what the East Berlin national anthem was because an East German girl was favorite to win one of the events. 
When he said i did well i kinda beamed. I don't have much to brag about so damnit i'm going to brag about a compliment from Herr Schade. 

It kinda feels good to be back into school again. I liked Spring break but all i did was work. 
and this means I get to see my two favorite profs.


Yesterday Shaun and I were looking at this book in Barnes and Nobles called ""The greatest cities in the world"" and I totally had to make a list of all the cities I wanted to visit. I kinda made an ass of myself. We were talking about stuff and inventions and great historical buildings (like the collesseum and the sistene chapel and michealangelo painting the sistene chapel) and i was like. ""sometimes it baffles my mind to think one day someone was just sitting around and then invented something. Like Ben franklin was just chillin one day and was like hey I'm going to invent the light bulb"". Then shaun was like ""um. you're in college right? Ben Franklin didn't invent the lightbulb"" so i said ""OH yeah. what did he invent? Oh yeah he invented electricity."" 
Shaun-He didn't INVENT electricity, he DISCOVERED IT.
Me- I swear I go to college.
Shaun- You know. You would think you know stuff like this. You speak like, what 300 languages?
This is the point when i turned my head and saw a guy reading a magazine chuckling at our conversation. He stood right by us until we were done looking at the book. He  shook his head a couple of times because well, that wasn'nt exactly my brightest day. I'm glad i brought some joy to someone because of my stupidity.

i got a d in geology. i may have been able to get a c if i went to class and did the homwork. amazing how when those components come together i do pretty well in school..next quarter i will have to make up for my slackerness...
i've also discovered online radio stations. man i am so like 555513268 years behind everyone else technologically. our family bought a dvd player like 5 years after theycame out... and i was way behind on the whole camera phone thing... i'm surprised my family drives cars.
i want a new piercing.
my spring break has officially started and i kinda feel like crap. it's way too cold outside to be spring break. maybe i'll go to the tanning bed and hoodwink myself into believing that i can tan.
that's one of my goals for germany. if i have to be in a bathing suit (which will probably wind up being some kind of twisted school requirement) i'm going to be tan. and not that orange gross tan that looks like you can scrape off someone's skin because they've been to the tanning bed too many times. 
i want to buy something.
too bad i';m broke. i should get myself a sugar daddy. if my boyfriend had lots of money that would be sweet. (i love him anyways) 
i'm going to claddaugh's and to see the movie v for vendetta. but i just thought of something. it's saint patrick's day and it's an irish restaurant. that may not be a good combination because it will be ungodly packed. but i bet it will be fun. i think i would actually wait for a table since it is irish day! 
GO IRISH!
i didn't even know that wales was considered a celtic land. that's kinda sweet. my ancestors are from ireland and wales (and germany and native america) so i'm double the celt! well or like (2/6 the celt!)

it's amazing how much crap i say on here. i can't get rid of this journal though. i've had it for like 5 years

We have the rest of this week and next week. Then it's exams. ew. i have two german exams in the same day. NO, no they are within a couple of hours of eachother. dousche.bag. 

then work is kinda. um. stupid.
I don't hate my job. which is always a good sign. but some of the people there are just not my cup of tea. at least i find solace with some people i have ""befriended"" it's weird. I'm such an outgoing person i always have fun with whoever i'm with. but at larosa's i kinda feel like an outsider. Not that i'm hurt or anything. they have their cliques and friends and i just happened to step onto the employment team a little late. I don't really care i just hate sitting at work when everyone's talking and having a good time. I guess it will just take some more time. I do have a couple people that really make work a more fun place. There are some girls (ashley, Jamie, Kelly) who are really nice and i actually can joke around with them. it's reminiscent of frisch's. (as in i am crazy jamie who gives customers 'a dinner and a show'.) 

that's one thing i miss. I was friends with almost everyone at work (or at least got along with them) and so i just had a good time with the people there. and my customers. oh well. i make more money at larosa's.
London/Munich/Dublin plans are a little hectic. The prices i'm seeing are a little high but jessica (one of the girls i am traveling with) saw some good ones we should snatch them up right quick. 

Dude.
Lustpartnerin.
hahah.
sorry, that just popped in my head. this kid in my german class was joking around about our teacher and said that he had a lust partner and it's funny only because it's a play on words. well in german it is. 
yeah i'm a geek.

I made 80 dollars last night, so that was something to celebrate about, except that all of it has to go to my wonderful cingular bill.. woot. 
to go to germany, i have to save 17 dollars a day, and so far, i haven't really put that much aside. damn. i suck at this game. 
I had a dream last night that i had a baby brother... shockingly he looked exactly like leigha except he was wearing blue. and i was so excited about him. I took care of him all day and my friends came to see him in the hospital, but instead of finding the room i spent the whole dream leading them around the hospital passin the room up multiple times and not being able to find it. weird. 
i have to work today again. oh rapture oh joy.
two german papers due monday, the same day as my spanish exam. tonight is going to be barrels of fun. 

so this is something i just have to update about because it was so shocking and weird.
the other day i was at kroger picking up  my pictures that i had dropped off early that week. the girl who develops them doesn;t even ask my name but has them all ready when i walk up to the counter and says ""you're related to David."" not so much a question as a statement of fact. I was like ""yeah he's my brother."" so i wait for her to get the pictures together so i can pay and get out of there. but instead of leaving me be, she is like ""can i ask you something? If it's too personal i understand you don't have to answer it."" I'm thinking, lady if you have to ask that and you don't know me then you probably should not be prying into my life. I'm thinking she is just going to ask if there is something wrong with my brother or something not too probative. So i agree to her interrigation. She says, ""Is David homeless?"" I didn't really know what to say. I should have just said ""well ok bye."" but instead I got into this discussion with her about how my brother is kinda sorta homeless but he can't live with us because him and my dad would fight too much. This is not really a conversation i wish to have with a total stranger. i was already mega uncomfortable and wanted to leave but NATURALLY this conversation would not stop. She said, ""David says he has to protect you from your dad. That he beats you"" (it wasn't a statement. it was a question formed like a statement. I wanted to throw my fucking pictures in her face in hopes that every single one of them gave her a paper cut. I couldn't just walk away, I was in a catch 22. Don't answer her question and everyone at kroger thinks my dad beats his children. answer her question and have a conversation with someone that is none of their damn business. I was so shocked that a stranger would ask me this that i answered. i was like ""does it look like my dad beats me?"" i wanted to punch her in the face and say ""maybe my brother should protect YOU from ME."" my dad has never laid a hand on me in my entire life. He has spanked me maybe once when i was like 3. nothing beyond that. never pushed me, never slapped me. i'll be the first to tell you all about my dads temper but he is not a monster. He yells, he doesn't hit. what the fuck. so david likes to make up things while he is begging for money to gain sympathy. Then of course, after i explained to her that my dad is not a child abuser, she kept getting deeper and deeper on my ""if i was a rude person, i would wipe that damn smirk off your face"" list. seriously. you don't ask a total stranger questions like this. before i knew it i was shocked into talking to this stupid bitch about my life. my business. you know what fuck that. tina funk----->>> *fuck that* because that bitch didn't grow up with me, she doesn't know anything about me, i would never ask someone ""so hey, yeah does your dad beat you? oh yeah is your brother homeless? does he do bad things? is he ok?"" fuck her. fuck her in the ass. hard.
twice.
i stayed there for like 10 to 15 minutes talking to this girl trying to explain to her that my brother makes shit up, but he's not a bad person. he's a mentally unstable compulsive liar. soemtimes he doesn't give a shit about anyone else. but he's my brother. 
i went home so pissed off, and confused i didn't know what to do. Except i knew i wanted to throw up. on that girl."

"event","it's been quite some time since i've updated. I've kind of felt like a dilluted version of myself lately. School is good, in that i go and i don't hate it, i love my teachers and i'm not doing badly in my classes. But naturally i've fallen into a routine, and we all know how one can get when one has fallen into a routine. I work at Larosa's four times a week. Which seems like a good amount of days to be working while going to school. But i never make enough money to pay for the things that i need to pay for. Naturally, this is every college persons reality. Except for the bastards who have rich daddies. DAMN THE MAN. and me and shaun are fine. Nothing really going on. We pretty much do the same thing everytime we hang out. WHich isn't a bad thing, i'm not complaining. I've just never been in a serious relationship before, but i know this is normal. we still laugh and whatever. I'll just have to spice it up i guess.
So yeah, dilluted. I went over to David and Laura Millers house. And everytime i've been there in the past we've all laughed and i've been funny and we've had great times. But when i went over the there the other day i just felt boring. NOt bored. I PERSONALLY felt like a boring person. I had nothing interesting to talk about so i rambled on about mundane stuff. I kinda felt bad for them, having to listen to my stupid stuff just to fill the silence in my head. Man i used to be an interesting fun person. I need summer to come so i can stop talking about doctor's appointments and have some real fun going on. I can't wait to go to Germany. I think that will set me straight. 
MUNICH, HO!"

"event","So lately, and tina can attest for this, i have been attracted to songs by rappers that i should most definitely not like. For example my new ""favorites"" are that song that goes ""girl you make my whistle blow"" and for some strange reason i like that laughy taffy song. I hate it, but i loooove it.  it's a sickness really.
so today is my first official day at larosa's on boudinot. I am a server. Oh yeah, i got a job at larosas. i work tonight from 430-1 and tomorrow at 345. then sunday at 1045. Just so i can get my training out of the way and be on my way to making some moolah and getting my own tables. I'm actually kind of nervous about it. i hate being the new person at a job. but i promised myself i would stay at this job until the end of the summer. and then should i choose to go somewhere else, so be it. But hopefully that wont happen. I'm sick of moving around to different jobs. If you think about it, it only seems like i've had a lot of jobs because i had two jobs for a long time. (frisch's and zen and now, and then zen and now and delaney's) but thank god those days are over. 
I am making a present for allison ( i drew hwer name) and i'm not sure if it's going to be done by the time we have the party to exchange gifts. I may have to cut down on the amount of gifts i am making just so that i can finish it. I feel like such a crappy friend. I saw this thing at the mall that was perfect for my friend carly, something else i wanted to buy for my friend miranda, and something else that i wanted to get shaun. but i had zero dollars for any of it.
hopefully taht will change and i'll make a lot of tips working at larosa's. my goal is to avoid giving tables away as much as possible. 
this week is exam week. i have been really stressed out but for some reason not really stressed out about exams. monday all i had to do was bs my way through a paper in world lit. wednesday i had to type up a german papaer and hand it in and also take a spanish exam. I was a little messed up because i just came from 2 and a half  hours of writing in german but i made it through. It was hard but i wasn't that stressed out. Today is my hardest day. I took a geology exam but i didn't even let myself think about that too much simply because i can't learn the whole quarter in one night so i just kinda skimmed and then took the exam. and then at 130 i have to take my other german final. That one I'm only slightly queasy about. I love the teacher and he is a fair grader but i don't want to feel stupid when i leave the classroom like i did after the last test. So i am meeting up with two people from german beforehand (at eleven) to study."

"event","So. Part of me wants to feel sorry for myself and wallow in self pity and the other part of me is like ""bs. what a douschebaggy thing to do"". 
My parents have hit almost rock bottom. They have no money for anything. Literally. We aren't having christmas this year at all. They don't have enough money to give any gifts so my mom decided that maybe we could volunteer at a soup kitchen this year. That sounds fine, maybe we could volunteer at the no kill animal shelter and play with the puppies and kitties. That would be fun. I know this is good for me. I mean why spend christmas counting your presents and wishing away for things that in the long run may not even matter. I am just going to miss the tradition of seeing stuff under the tree. Maybe I'll wrap some shoe boxes or something and put them under the tree just so that it looks like we are doing something. I am just going to miss that tradition. In the past years we haven't exactly been having lush christmases anyways.. Lately it just hasn't been about that. I'm not sad that i'm not going to be getting presents. I'm sad because it just reflects how crappy my family is doing right now. I pay for pretty much all my own stuff, which i'm not complaining about, i'm an adult and can pay my own bills. (read: the expected ones) so it's not about that. I should be giving back to people who don't have as much as my family does. But sometimes I just wish that it wasn't the case. that may sound selfish but i'm sick of being ""poor."" this caste sucks. 
on that note. I need a new job. I don't have enough money to do anything beyond a couple activities (which i immediately feel guilty for) and bill paying. I am actually considering going back to my job at frisch's just so that i can make some cash to immediately put in the bank. That was my problem last time. I spent everything I had instead of putting the money in the bank. I may apply at larosa's by my house. I wonder how that would work out. 
suggestions?"

"event","Ok so here is my dad., I decided that there were too many bitter people in the world and although i had the most rediculous day ever, which i will quickly be explaining to you in a minute. hopefully somone will find it humorous. anyway.. bitter people. there are so many people who waste away their life their days and the sanity of those around them on being bitter about every little thing that happens to them. In death situations bitterness for awhile is understandable. But when you drop your sunglasses or you forget to tie your shoe bitterness is unacceptable. I've heard so many people telling me about their terrible days and when i hear some of it i think ""you are pissed off about that? wow."" i understand i guess somethings... when i was 16-18ish i was very bitter about a lot of things. lik the fact that i was weird, and most people thought i was bisexual. But who cares? i was bitter because i couldn't afford the things that i wanted to afford. I wasn't just mad, i was hateful and resentful. Who needs that? i look back at the problems i thought i had then and i just wish i could have talked to myself two years ago, apearing in my form today and tell myself what a selfish stupid face i was being. Talk about bitter beer face. I understand that life sucks. yes sometimes it does. sometimes shit happens that no one expects and it breaks your heart and your mind. Sometimes even your spirit. But it's what we do with ourselves in those situations that makes us better people. Do we blame eveyrone else for our problems (everyone from god to our mom?) or do we say damn i was a moron and move on? That's what makes us adults. This is what i'm trying to do formyself now. If something is my fault i'm trying to learn how to be like ""really, Jamie?""  and move on. Obviously i'm not amazing at that right now but i'm trying. the other thing i really have to work on is not carrying everyone else'es problems with me. for some reason everyone else's bad days become my bad days. One of my friends will tell me all about their bad day and the feelings that they are having and instead of giving them advice comforting them then moving on i give them advice comfort them then carry their burden with me the rest of the day. I remember thinking one day, i am having a bad day. Why? and when i realized that the reason i was having a bad day is because one of my friends had told me all about what was ailing her and i was dwelling on those things i was able to say. yeah sweet jamie maybe you should focus on something that involves YOUR OWN PROBLEMS. 

anyways,
so today i had a doctor's appointment at my thyroid doctor at eleven thirty. So i arrive at said time and place and (for sake's of being creative i am calling her...->) la recepcionista said to me that my doctor was in fact on vacation and that i did not have an appointment today and it was, of course, on thursday. So i was like, wow taht's news to me. ps i was missing both my german classes and my spanish class to be ther. So i flee from the building of impromptu-appointment-changes and get in my car. i go to shaun's afterwards because naturally i chose this exact moment to realize the hugeness of my predicament and i start to cry. I had missed a test in german to be at that satanic building and i was not away of whether the teacher would let me make it up. So, i go to shaun's and he comforts me and i fall asleep for about an hour.  this is so obviously what i should have been doing at this point. I make it back onto campus and i am checking my email at exactly (i looked) 2:30. I read an email from my professor saying that the last chance i have to take this test is at 15.30, he was writing in german and used the 24 hour clock. I go SHIT THAT'S 230. THAT'S NOW!  i run, literally, from the computers in the library to old chem where my teacher's office is. I arrive and instead of Herr Rademann answering the phone, the afore mentioned german professor, Wolfgang Lueckel answers the office door. I had him last year for a german class and we had a lovely little chat about where we though Herr Rad was. We were just discussing the different dialects in Southern Germany (in all actuality) and I realize however much schooling i could have had, could not have prepared me for use of the 24 hour clock. 15:30 is not 2:30 but it is 3:30. So i realize my error and i call my boss patrick to tell him i will be late because i have o take a test at three thirty. Finally, my hour is up and Herr Rademann arrives and sits me down in a depressing classroom and hands my my ""quiz"". This ""quiz"" was four pages. i was ECSTATIC. so i take the quiz, which turns out to be REALLY REALLY EASY (Don't you wish i was telling the truth)and get to the end. Where i write some completely in comprehensible sentences about Gustav Mahler and his life and memories. I finally get to work at quarter til 5, supposed to be ther eat three. and i manage to sell one subscription out of sheer desperation. I am now sitting in my fuzzy pajamas and kicking back. YES!

On another, completely non academic note i went to the ren fest this weekend and saw the mudde show. that is amazing and anyone who has never taken part in a  mudde show at ren fest should immediatly take part in one. now. go."

"event","there is this guy at my work that sometimes i like and sometimes he makes me so angry. i won't go into specifit details because they are too trivial but i will provide a couple metaphhorical examples.
when a coworker bursts into your cubicle and starts talking to you it is assumed that they are there to have conversation. so you continue with conversation. in the rules of speaking to one another in the united states of america (it's probably like rule one or two) when someone asks you a question you are usually compelled to ask the same question. let's use... i don't know.. age for an example. How old are you jamie? then one is expected to provide an adaquate answer, one full of truth and then expected to ask the same questioin... or one of similar importance... like oh i don't konw... hold old are you.... (insert name here)? and once that question is asked it is supposed that that person will provide an answer that both answers the question and does not leave the other person in THEIR OWN CUBICLE wondering what the fuck just happened. let's say that this metaphorical situation ends with one party refusing to give an age. so the other party, for arguments sake this party is the same party that own's the cubicle, jokes around a little and the person who did the bursting into the other party's cubicle ends the conversation with ""don't personalize my insecurities"" NOW HERE IS THE WRONG ENDING TO THIS METAPHORICAL SITUATION obviously i, or that is to say the owner of the cubicle, would not have wanted to pummel the other party if the question was just answered in a manner that was both acceptable and not a load of shit. so you don't want to tell me how old you are? well then don't fucking ask how old i am. i know you have a mysterious life or something to hide from all us lower beings who obviously don't believe any of the underground things that you believe but at least you could acknowledge the rules of proper converstation and expect that when speaking with another party and asking them questions it will be implied that they will in turn ask the same ones of you. if you are not prepared for that don't burst into my cubicle and pump me for questions then leave me sitting in my BROKEN chair with no answers of my own. jerk.
and that is the end of my completely metaphorical, hypothetical, non sensical situation.
but on to other things. school is alright i guess. and work makes me want to shit on someone's desk.. no? ok maybe it just makes me want to leave and not work there anymore. if i hear one more time ""we've gotta get your sales up. we've gotta get your sales up"" i'm going to tear down all the cubicle walls and throw all my sheets into the air and break the window with a desk drawer."

This movie was based on a true story. it's crazy. but i had to make tina stay at my house last night after seeing it. and i fell asleep with jesus music on and the lights on. i've never felt so strange after a movie. i was scared but i also felt vulnerable for some reason. like any day demons are going to possess someone i know. i was very frightened. i woke up like every five minutes and looked around my room wide eyed. 
on a different note. i finally did some good school shopping. i bought three pairs of jeans. about twenty dollars each. so i should be good for a long time.

well today i'm just going to sit around, maybe watch flight of the navigator and then pick my mom up at school. and probably hang out with shaun. i can't believe that school starts on wednesday. i haven't even ahd three weeks vacation and i'm already back to school. BS!

"event","On the way home from shaun's apartment while i was driving i was struck by this unsettling thought; people don't change they adapt. People are the same throughout history. One can argue that people are more advanced nowadays, people are smarter, people are less barbaric than the caveman-club-carrying-heman that appears to be where we spawned from. i would say that we haven't really changed one bit since then. And there isn't much difference between a five year old and fifty five year old (besides the noteable appearance and of course the amount of time and experience on this earth. Humans have always had to deal with fear. In the caveman days (forgive my obvious failure to have first hand experience in this matter) i am sure that there was the everyday fear that a wooly mammouth was going to saunter into your cave unnanounced and shank you with it's tusks. Now we live in fear of terrorists sauntering into our country and 'shanking' us with biological weapons. The five year old may be afraid of spiders or the dark but as that five year old goes through the obligatory rites of passages and exchanges childhood for adolescence, and then adolescence for adulthood the fear just molds and conforms itself to that person's lifestyle. Now we are afraid of being alone, we are afraid that our family may be injured on their way to work, some of us are still, myself included, afraid of the dark. 
We, as humans, have also had to learn how to deal with fitting in, or how precisely not to fit in. I'm sure it seems like it must have been easier in the time when our community was made up of the people who we sat by the fire with at night out in a field in front of our cave under the stars. Those people wore the same loinclothes over their genitals that we did, they also had to struggle to survive. The weak were weeded out, it would seem under harsher conditions. now we struggle through our teen years to find out who we are.... we aren't much different than those comparing the size of their clubs by the fire, we just use different things such as cars, houses, and clothes to weed out the ""weak."" Sometimes early on, we see people with simalar situations and feel comfortable around them. Sometimes much later we fall into our groups of people, some of us may just never find the people with the same second-hand loincloths and battered wooden clubs. but eventually, we usually find where we belong. I, thankfully, have found my people. I am proud to say though that i have many many friends and if lined up side by side not one of them looks the same on the outside. But it's comforting to know that we are all still struggling with the same fears, emotions and limitations that our friends are, and those people who came much much earlier than we did. 
after thinking about this while driving around, i started to think about what i was afraid of. what am i afraid of? where do i fit in? what makes me me? what makes me very much the same as the first puckett that ever walked this earth?  I, Jamie Puckett, am afraid of spiders, the dark, trusting myself to be honest and letting someone see my entire self. I have a lot of friends. I love them all uniquely and dearly. My community consists of but is not limited to my family, all my friends and schoolmates and my coworkers.   These are the people i see on a mostly regular basis and i love them all. I think what makes me, me is my capacity to listen until my ears fall off. i believe i have listened endlessly to all of the above mentioned people relieve themselves of their heavy burdens. And i'm not complaining about that. I hope that all the puckett's that have walked before me have been just as randomly ocd about lining up their perfume bottles and shoes as i am. I know the immediate puckett that ""came before"" me is most definitely a closet ocd inflictee. When comparing closets you won't find my mother;s shoes in a neat row, or her clothes colorcoded with specific sub categories in each color coding. But take a look at Jim Puckett and it is proudly displayed. 
on the outside my dad doesn't look too weird. he just looks like a shy guy who likes to protect his family and who shops at the village in newport. But he is where, i believe, all my oddities come from. 
wow, that was long, i'm sorry to all those who continued to read this. thank you for that.
my last thought when pulling into my driveway was, what am i adapting into? But then i may have only thought that because when i looked out my car window, i saw my dad standing in the middle of the yard in the same blue UK shorts and white t shirt (with arm pit holes) he wears every night to bed, waving his hands and saying loudly ""on the porch bailey!"""

"event","for some reason when i woke up this morning i was depressed. i was cranky last night because i was tired so i think i hurt shaun's feelings. i was supposed to test drive my car last night so that i can get a feel for it and so that my dad could check to see if their were any leaks but apparently it was too late so i did that today. i also had this dream last night that it was the first day of school and i went to all the wrong classes and i couldn't even find what building my last class was in and when i woke up i was conjugating the verb estudiar (to study) in preterite and subjunctive. i couldn't stop doing it when i woke up either. and then when that was finished i had spanish nonsense sentences firing in my head like ESTUDIARE PAGAR. which means i will study to pay. that doesn't make any sense. so i felt guilty for being mean to shaun, i was slightly downtrodden because my car is a big hunk of metal and their are still thigns wrong with it (though they will be fixed soon) and i was utterly confused upon waking because even in my sleep i can't escape studying. 
i would say i can't wait for classes to begin but if i said that out loud then i would wake up and the next thing i knew it would be the first day of school. and goodness knows i do not want that to happen. i just ended school. i got a 4.0 for the summer. i mean i only took one class but i got a's in all three ""quarters."" i asked my lacey if she wanted to hang out on wednesday but i haven't heard back from her. maybe we will hang out and then we'll laugh a lot. i couldn't pick up my books yesterday because the uc bookstore was closed so me and tina are going tomoro to spend 300 dollars i don't have.

I finally got my car. 1991 corsica. crappy but hey it's a car and it just needs a little bit of love. and maybe i could give that to it if i were allowed to drive my own damn car., but i can't until it gets some oil leak fixed. once that's over it's smooth sailing.. hopefully. I've watched both seasons of the showtime tv show ""dead like me"" that show is fabulous. i love it. and i think now that i'm done watching that i'll be movig on to six feet under. i really don't do anything much lately.. not that i'm really complaining i have literally no money to do anything. all i do have i have to save for gatlinburg this coming weekend. i was semi contemplating going down to the fireworks but i have no gas money to go down there no bus fair money to go down their either... no money for food and no money to buy food to take down with me. it's a no win situation. i'm not a huge firworks fan they aren't my thing but i think i would have a good time if i went down with a bunch of my friends. tomoro morning i have to go down to uc and buy my books for my classes. that will put me about 400 dollars in debt  but still they will look all pretty for the first week of classes. 
we gave my dog a bath this morning. well we gave both of them a bath. but bailey freaks out when something tragic like this happens to him. he was barking in anger and frustration when we were drying him off. he kept getting pissed when the blow dryer got near his face.
i am going to have to get my hair cut soon ... 
my dad keeps pushung me to get online and check out the oppurtunities they have... we heard on the news that schools around here need people to help teach kids english. i would like that since well i like other languages but i just don't want to start something up with some cute little kid and then have to quit right when school starts.. there is no way i'm going to take 18 hours of school, 20 hours of one job and then start up another job when i don't have huge amounts of time already. i knmow working twenty hours doesn't seem like alot during school but it feels like a lot. especially when you add onall the bull shit homework teachers give you. 
wow i've become boring online journal girl...
shaun finally got his books back from his ex girlfriend who had them for over 2 years and was able to get his fine's reduced to 50 dollars or something like that (they were over 200). but he only paid tina 25 dollars and she took off the rest of the money because it pays to have awesome friends in the library system. 
my friend mandy is having a girl! 
Well i can't think of any other way to bore everyone's socks off...

"event","Well Zen and Now cut my hours. So i don't work Saturdays anymore. 
Meanwhile back at the ranch, I met with someone about work study (I have to supplement paying for school on my own apparently because my dad makes 'too much'... have you seen what we drive? my dad does not make too much money) but the lady told me that work study only employs me. i have to use the money they give me for employment to pay for school. That's the stupidest thing i have ever heard. Why should I do that? I have a job now that I could use to ""supplement my loans"". I swear UC has a 10 year contract with Lucifur himself. What they hell are they thinking? Ps, I would have to pay for the first quarter before school starts which would undermine the whole system of ME NEEDING MONEY TO PAY FOR SCHOOL. IF I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY NOW WHAT THE HELL MAKES THEM THINK I CAN COME UP WITH IT IN THREE WEEKS. and i guess my door prize for being a UC cronie is that i get to make 7 dollars an hour being some science teacher's bitch or working at wendy's. Personally I'd rather run errands for someone or work as a receptionist than work at the fucking wendy's. That is bullshit and it pisses me off. 
and i am the craziest person i have ever met... i'm now taking six classes SO THAT i can become a double german and spanish major. I really do want to do it but it's going to be a lot of work. I am insane. And if i survive this i implore you all to please please throw me a huge party and revive me because the shock of actually being outside and doing something other than studying might send me into a coma.
last night we went to see jim gaffagin at go bananas. oh my god he is hilarious. Everyone knows joe fox.. he reminds me of joe fox. except taller. and a little different. but all the same i couldn't breath for the first three minutes of him being on stage because i was laughing so hard. ACTUALLY LAUGHING. and it was kinda embarrassing because when i laugh really hard my shoulders shake and i propel my body forward. I'm surprised i didn't have motion sickness by the end of the night. 
my friend melissa is back from italy so hopefully we get to hang out today. i think me tina vince shaun and if melissa is awake, are all going to go see forty year old virgin today.They tried to ditch me but i would kill them for going to see a potentially good movie without me. kill them dead.
although i'm supposed to hang out with rosa. which would help me get spanish practice but only if melissa is awake because she might still be jet lagged. 
ok well i've gotta go

"event","soo... it's been an interesting couple of days.. my cousin whom i have not seen or spoken to in a couple years finds me on facebook and drops me a line. it was really cool.. i wonder if any of my other family is on the net whom i haven't seen..
i wake up for work on friday and i come downstairs to find a new tv sitting in place of our 15 year old other one. it's sleek! apparently my dad was sick of hitting the tv with his fist to make the sound work.
on the same simalar ish note ..our microwave is starting to fall apart. mind you i don't blame it.. things used to be made to last and this microwave is a ""living"" proof of that. 
our microwave is 23 years old. the thing is older than i am! literally! i idolize it. 
our dryer broke too that one is just about the same age as our tv. 
my point in all this is that they just don't make things like they used to. electronics, music, everything. i'm thinking that appliances these days are designed to be repurchased and replaced about every 5-7 years. that's rediculous! (sp?)

i have had the wors couple of days at delaney's. thursday and friday i didn't sell anything and my boss and the sales trainer and the owner of the company had a meeting. during which they all praised me on how well i was doing and all of them (in front of everyone else eeeek) said that i sound so natural and made a point to single me out. and then we got on the phones and started making some calls.. i didn't sell anything thursday or friday. i cried in the bathroom on friday because i was so frusterated by people making up stupid shit for reasons they didn't want to by the product. yoiu know what? if you don't want to listen to waht i have to say say something when i say ""i just wanted to take aminute and tell you a little bit about it"" then you can say ""you know what i am busy"" and then i can hang up and talk to someone who doesn't have a stick up their fucking ass

my dad salvaged a laptop (that they were going to throw away) at his work when it went out of business so now i have a really old and kinda heavy laptop. but it works. well he's working on that last sentence.. to make it work better. all ineed is the internet and microsoft word and i am good to go. my mom has made it known that she doesn't really want me using her computer because she has all kinds of programs on it that are sensitive. she has this program that types what she speaks so that she doesn't have to use her hands to type out her papers... and instant messangeer apparently disrupts that..

i have no money. which means that lately all i've been doing is staying home and rereading harry potter. GOD LOVE JKROWLING for making books that can be read over and over and over again.

well i guess i'll be off...

well i sold 2 on monday and two on wednesday so i figured i was not going to be gleefully enjoying a 25 dollar addition to my paycheck. instead i pulled 6 subscription sales from somewhere out of my ass and sold them. i've never even thought about selling that many in one day. so i got the 25 dollar bonus. which means for four days of work at delaney's i will be getting 200 dollars. hell yeah!

zen has been going well too. except for these stupid kids who like to come in and burn things. literally some kid with a red mohawk... stupid stupid kid was lighting shit on fire on the front porch. and he brought about 10 (literally) of his teeny bopper friends with him. after he was reprimanded some of his friends came in and were like ""dude sorry my friend is a wank"" which was much appreciated. but still. 

school is alright. i've been doing really well in spanish. (the only class i am currently enrolled in) our teacher said nobody does well on her first quizzes because nobody expects them to be really hard. I got a 97 on it. so i was excited about that. i will not settle for anything less than an A in that class. not even an A-. 

scheduling my classes for next term was THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. uc has decided that if Jamie Puckett needs to take a class (literally, needs to take it in order to finish and graduate) then it will be completely full and or unavailable to her in some other unforeseen way. i was looking at my degree audit. i have like 3 years ahead of me. and then i still ahve to go to interpreting school. my arts and sciences requirements are far off... my german minor requirements are even farther off and my spanish major requirements are so far off i can't even make them out. 

i finished the sixth harry potter book in under 48 hours. it would have been less but i was sleeping some of the time and i had to work a little. i can't believe dumbledore dies. i cried throughout the whole funeral. i can't believe it. and i think i know who stole the horcrux and replaced it with the fake one (a tip off by my boyfriend) and i am disappointed because i know that jk rowling is going to take so much time writing the last book because it's her little baby and it's all grown up that i will probably have graduated by that time. but i understand. it's going to be hard for us readers to accept that in one mor ebook there will be no more harry potter books. i think though that she will go on to write something else. i hope she does another series, although she doesn't really have to do anything for the rest of her life financially. because with the next book and the next 3 movies she is freaking rich... not that that matters to her, i don't think. i love her back story. she really is a self made woman... and kinda my role model. i love writing but i don't know how she writes with such passion and is so captivating. she has literally taken every age group (whether they can read or not) and gripped them and sucked them into the world she created. I actualy was telling my friend jill the other day that sometimes i'm just waiting for my letter to come from hogwarts.. haha

well.... i must do some spanish homework.

i've been selling one subscription a day... so far i've made 18 dollars in commission this week. haha it doesn't sound like much but there are oppurtunities to make lots of money there. 
school is alright in the summer i guess. i mean it's not totally bad. except some of the people in the classaren't that great at spanish. it doesn't really bother me when people try really hard and still aren't great at spanish or get answers wrong. because they are trying and are actually actively participating.. but there is this one girl who just sits in class and doesn't listen and every question he asks she is like 'oh what? can you say that again' and laughs about it. it makes me want to kick something. because the others of us can be using that time to learn something that we didn't know. i know that i need to know all the spanish i can learn in the little time they give us because it's my freaking major.

played some volleyball, partook in some authentic italian-ness, went to shadowbox cabaret, rented the maschinist. don't ever watch that movie unless you understand the un-understandable.

wednesday it's school, delaney's and then seeing theresa and hayden (shaun's friends who are moving to seattle)
thursday it's school, delaney's and then un sure
friday it's school delaney's and gym appointment. then me lacey and allison are hanging out. which should be fun because i don't get to see them that often.

Friday. Worked like a chode and a half. tried to avoid hanging out with the Mexicans as Melissa and I were in a rather foul moods because of work. Then went home
Saturday. Worked til three. Shaun picked me up and we went to POTTERY TO KILN FOR. It was super fun. I loved it. I would suggest anyone do this because although i didn't get to physically make the pottery it was very fun to paint. And not too too expensive. Then we attempted to go to PF Chang's. The second i got out of the car I smelled it and I wanted that food so bad. But because of stupid people's proms we had to revert to dewey's pizza. That was fun. then went back to shaun's an dhad the most amazing sex. Just kidding I don't do that. We actually watched the first part of THIS IS SPINAL TAP. We fell asleep but i really wanted to finsih it. Went home.
Sunday. me and shaun went to my brother's for some veggie tacos and then we met up with vince and tina at bar louie. Then we saw JLo's new movie Monster in law. It was ok i guess.
on my actual birthday i was broke.
but shaun got me black vans with pirate skulls on them and perfume for my birthday. Tina bought me the new will smith cd and melissa got me someting which i have noe revcieved  yet. 
So... Last night at zen. Miranda Ryan and Amy Baggot came to visit me and i had the mnost stupdendous time. i lvoe them. especially when i see pictures of them at the park (which i could not go to because of a stupid french film paper due for history)
today the plan is chipotle and work. Then french film paper. BLECH BLECH BLECH BLECH.

i have a german midterm in about 58 miinutes and i still haven't studied for it. I suck at being a good student this quarter. i kicked uc's academic systems ass last quarter. but this time aroundi just can't bring myself to open any books. ir ealize this is a normal affliction, because everyone i talk to is like FUCK SCHOOL I FUCKING HATE FUCKING SCHOOL. at least i haven't dropped the f bomb in relation to school lately.
i feel like i'm in a rut. my life is just going smoothly and that freaks me out. I haven't really been having many problems with my parents. no fights with friends to keep things emotional. only a couple very minor relationship bumps (aka tiny fights about not hearing from eachother) and those only last like 4 seconds. no drama over my major. school isn't spectacular but it's not a disaster area. my jobs haven't really presented much problems. my shoping habits are high however, they don't conflict that much with my ability to do other things. 
it's weird. 
i guess i'd rather smooth sailing than tumultuous currents 
i shouldn't really be complaining because there are people less fortunate than i am. 
which makes me think of all the things i still want to accomplish.
like
traveling across europe
learning to speak gaelic and learning sign language
volunteering at animal shelters and women shelters
graduating and then going to KENT STATE for interpreting school

i hope i don't turn out to be one of those people who gets a degree in something really impressive or great and winds up working a desk job someplace that sounds like they would use their degree but they only in fact answer phones and transfer calls. that stuff is fine for a star out but i actually want to use my degree. i will have to go to interpreting school though if i want to do that. 
this morning tina told me she had a primal urge to lob her umbrella off the fourth floor of scioto-jefferson garage and hit some women in the head with it while she was peacefully walking down the sidewalk. 
i ahve been watching alot of sex and the city lately and it's amazing. i think i'm a lot like miranda and carrie. 
so, i guess that's all

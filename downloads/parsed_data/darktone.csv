"event","Yes, once again its time for my RARE rant^^

Months ago while watching dvds I decided to dedicate 1 month to watching nothing but the audio commentary on films. So all of July I watched/listened to the commentary of films.
Thier was no real reason to do this apart from taking advantage of what the dvds offer other than blooper reels and easter eggs lol!

I love movies, so yes as the subject suggests, watching them would 'spoil the magic' of how films were done. But you just find out so much about films.

The films I watched (in order) were:

Spiderman,
Predator,
The Last Samurai,
The Fast And The Furious,
How High,
X-Men,
Training Day, 
Charlies Angels,
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,
Oceans 11,
2 Fast 2 Furious,
Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back,
X-Men 2,
Rush Hour 2,
Collateral,
Pirates Of The Caribbean,
Charlies Angels 2,
SWAT,
Terminator 2,
Spiderman 2.

I tried to get as many different varieties of film as I could (looking at this list my dvd collection is wierd)

Predator made me laugh! The guy doing the comments was pretty pissed with the film. He kept saying negative things. How High made me laugh too. By the end Method Man and Redman were so high they just kept giggling^^ Oceans 11 was cool. Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon done commentary for that.

Their was some films (SWAT, both Spidermans) that had 2 sets of commetary going on at the same time! They kept switching, like they weren't even in the same room.
But Terminator was the strangest. They had 26 (yes,26) people do commentary for it!

I will have to do it again, but not too soon^_^"

"event","Ok. The offer at GAME (bring in 4, buy 1 for 99p) is coming to an end. So once I get hold of 4 games (hi Dean^^), the fun begins. But I STILL cant think of a good game to get. So if you have any ideas (Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube, I love them all so Im not picky^^) send them my way.

Still looking for decent horror films. Any Suggestions?

Quick question: What was your favourite board game as a kid (hell, even now) and why? Its just out of curiosity."

"event","...........And THATS how I avoided the police. Next week, burning the evidence!

Going to look for a scanner soon, very soon. Been getting quite a lot of requests for artwork recently (yes, im shocked too). Thanks to Dean and Jamie for putting some of my crap up for the world to see, but BOOOOOO for the constant abuse they write about me. I tell ya, theres two versions to any story: theirs...........and the truth ^^

Thought of SOOOOO many ideas today at work that I put them straight to paper, so it will be a while till their shown to the world.

I also thought it would be sw33t to put them here on live journal. Gonna start off as B/W but then go on to actually look professional (yea right) but gonna need some help......

Dean / Um Jammer Jamie: Going to need your help in showing me how to scan properly. Its probably easy but free advice is the best advice :)

CJ: Seeing your artwork you clearly know how to scan AND colour (yes, colour IS spelt with a 'U') so hopefully you can e-mail tips on what to do and how to clean them up.

Mokes: As 1 half of the jersey devils, you can be the nuts and bolts of this thing that holds it all together. Any random ideas you can think of that need to be sketched out e-mail to me ^^

Me_that_way: stop stalking me. Once I find out who you really are your in trouble!

Thats not just Tomoko either. ANYONE with good ideas throw them my way. CJ said the best thing to do is constantly draw. this way you get better and stay sharp (of course, this goes for anything).

Not just Manga has been requested. 4 friends heard I designed tattoos for other friends and myself, so they want those done too. 1 friend wants a celtic design for a tattoo. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! Another loves anime and music so he wants himself mixing on turn-tables (as a drawing, not a tattoo). CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! So you see, this seems to be branching out. Hope too many people dont catch wind of this, may have to start charging lol!

Off topic I bought a new game (curse Dean. Hes both a good friend and a bastard)its called Bujingai: Sword Master. Plays like Devil May Cry. I recommend both. Both on Playstation 2, not sure of any consoles.

Im off to bed, may draw, may watch speed 1 (CAUSE SPEED 2 SUCKS! BOOOOOOO!)

Oh, and dont worry, 'Dean On Fire' IS coming soon......... and I dont mean the drawing ^^"

"event","Seing CJ's rant gave me an idea, because im running out of things to write about. So heres 10 riddles for you to solve. Feel free to ask other people but DON'T use the internet for answers, it takes away the fun! AND AWAY WE GO!!!!!!!

1) A woman has 7 children, but half of them are boys. How is this possible?

2) George, Helen and Steve are drinking coffee, Bert, Karen and Dave are drinking tea. By these stats which one is Elizabeth drinking and why?

3) I cannot be seen or touched, but I can be felt by everyone. My existence is always in debate, yet I have my own style of music. What am I?

4) Bill bets Craig $100 that he can predict the score of the basketball match before it begins. Craig accepts and loses. How?

5) I am the ruler of shovels, I have a double. I'm as thin as knife, I have a wife. What am I?

6) What falls but never breaks? What breaks but never falls?

7) 2 fathers and 2 sons go hunting. they bring back a deer each but theres only 3. How?

8) Pronounced as one letter but look and you'll see,in truth im really writen as three. Im read from both ends, the same either way. What am I?

9) Fire is often maintained above me, and if you remove one letter you will find the home shared by everone. What am I?

10) My 1st half is a container, and I am a language understood by few if any. What am I?

OH! Almost forgot. Dean, your not aloud to play, cheater :)"

"event","Wow! what a week! well, from what I remember anyway. Im pretty sure it went like this:

Went to church, met CJ for the first time, went London lots of times, more church, had toe surgery, met Doctor watson, broke back on dance machine, more church ( those toys aren't gonna make it there on their own ) saw a dragon dancing, and then left with my dignity in tact.

I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT I DON'T TAKE DRUGS AND YES, THIS DID ALL HAPPEN *cough* except for church *cough* THANK YOU

Been a while since I wrote on here. Just caught a show called 30 greatest tv cars. Anyone that knows me knows im a HUGE Knightrider fan ^-^ so i knew it had to be there. and it was...........No.2. NO.2?! WTF? this is the greatest show ever made and it only made 2? it had a talking fucking car! No show could beat it, but apparantly some show called The Dukes Of Hazzards won ( yeah I know, i've never heard of it either ) I never watched the end to find out why it won but it did, so that pissed me off. 

I've never seen the show, so if anyone knows why it won please tell me. As for me, i'm gonna finish my box of Pocky (booooooo CJ) and go to bed. Laters"

"event","My fascination with Eastern films is still increasing. Martial arts, horror, whatever.

Having a talk friends a while ago, we went on to horror movies. I was asked what the scariest film I ever saw was. Then it hit me, there wasn't one. I could not think of a single film that was frightening. I mean, i've seen films that have come close, but to no prevail.

Then we talked about how the Japanese have a different style of horror to western films. No, im not gonna go into another 'Why Japanese horror films are better than.....well, everything else'. 
I was reccomended to watch 2 films, Ichi The Killer and The Grudge.

Now, I made it a personal point not to watch The Grudge because I saw so many clips from the American version it was pointless. Its The Sixth Sense all over again!

To make sure this would work I made sure it was night (thats obvious to some but my mum is one of the only people I know who watched Ringu at night. Woohoo!) and i was alone in my house. after watching BOTH films I was upset. It didn't work. WTF? They were both cool films, but not much of an effect.

Oh well. If anyone can recommend a good film for me to watch please let me know"

"event","Years ago I thought of something interesting/weird.

Cats are known to land on their feet. When bread is dropped, it is more likely to land buttered side down.

My question is: What would happen if you placed buttered bread on a cats stomach and dropped it?

I think the cat would just spin forever. Gravity would not have a say in the matter so it would just go round and round.

I haven't tried this theory yet, but if you own a cat, or just bored/drunk, please try it and tell me the results. Any video links would help."

"event","This detox is starting to kill me! I decided to cut down on alcohol for different reasons, the main one being physical fitness. Since alot of my exercise consists of weight lifting I don't pay attention on my speed and quickness.

Anyway, last year November I decided to go a couple of months without alcohol. But this promise of months turned into a year. Do NOT ask why.

So basically, I can't drink alcohol or any type of booze until the 1st of November 2005! No, I don't have an alcohol problem, but when you down 10 pints of beer, 6 shots of tequila and 6 cocktail drinks without feeling close to tipsy, well, you have to question your own morality.

Its been 2 months now and i'm doing well, considering that 70% of the time my friends are in bars! Being surrounded by beer doesn't help at all. I don't know how real alcoholics cope trying to quit, I guess you just have to take your stride one day at a time.

Its not all bad news, lost a lot of weight and saved lots of cash, and cash is good, very good. It helps me buy pretty things like more games for my Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube (oh and Dean, you owe me a rematch on pac-man vs) as well as dvds and cds.

So wish me luck, I WILL need it."

"event","I love movies. I mean who doesn't? some days life can be so depressing you need to escape reality. Films are one of the best ways to do this (games are great too).

But some films need to stay.........untouched. What I mean is some movies should be left alone and not remade. When i get free time from that community service called work, one thing i like to do is take a walk down to a film rental shop where a friend works. looking at some of the new and old releases I saw Tron on a shelf. Then I remembered a friend telling me that there was going to be a remake of the film. 

Remake?! Tron?! What the hell? This film set a trend and a new era in film f/x. It is a classic and should remain that way. Yes, with todays technology the f/x in movies are becoming more popular with todays younger audience, so rather than watch for a great plot-line with unsuspected twists, their watching to see how well explosions can be done.

Also, there are talks of an American remake of Battle royale. erm, WHY?! Apart from subtitles (which i don't mind cause i watch a lot of japanese stuff) this film is great. I have always said that Battle royale WILL be in my top 10 of films (but not No.1, that belongs to Aliens, ALL HAIL ALIENS).
I probably liked BR so much because because of the originality of it. Imagine, being drugged, taken to an island, and forced to fight 40+ people to the death.
You wont find that in a walt disney film (though the fox and the hound came close).

I didn't like the American version of The Ring. It was pretty much the same as the original Japanese version (Ringu) but again, no subtitles. And what the hell was up with those steps? No, no, Ringu was darker and scarier.

But maybe its me, maybe i'm young but old fashioned. Don't get me wrong, some days i prefer crap plotlines and more special f/x *cough, Charlie's Angels, cough* than i do a good storyline. 

If you do know if these films are being redone please let me know. I'm off, got to plan for Operation: Baby juggler."

"event","A couple of months ago i went out for a drink with friends. While waiting at the train station we got talking about video games, leading on to Mario.

Now I'M blaming the alcohol, but we came to the conclusion that Mario is in fact a drug addict.

No, i didn't stutter (or in this case, misspell). Look at the facts:

Super Mario 1 (nes) to gain super strength mario takes MUSHROOMS! 
Super Mario 3 (nes) to fly above everything, mario takes a leaf. A LEAF?! WTF?! And in lots of his games he gains access to a star, which makes him invincible. NOW, maybe its me, but maybe Mario THINKS hes invincible. Maybe the star represents some kind of acid pill,who knows.

As for the fire flower and raccoon tail, thats normal. In fact, every now and then i take my bear or frog suit out and attack red and green turtles.

Anyway, its just something to think about. feel free to feed-back. As for me, im off to watch some manga. Oh, by the way, i DON'T do drugs!"

"event","So Christmas came early this year, because everyone is going home for Christmas...so we just opened presents yesterday.
Here's what i got:

from Shannon: a red Nintendo DS Lite
              Final Fantasy 3
              Trauma Center: Under the Knife
              two shirts
              
from Kelli:   a bear hat
              1000 drinking games

from Amanda:  black pants

from Chase:   a new bed for Shannon and I


I have to say I'm really happy about all the things i got.
Brando and Baker might come up to have some beers tonight since I'm here by myself.
Shannon had to go to Louisville to have dinner with her parents today, and depending on the weather tonight she might be staying up there till tomorrow.
It's my day off from work, and the show I was supposed to play got canceled.

I'm really bored."

for what reason i don't know.

work still sucks.
shannon's birthday is coming up.
so is christmas.
i want to get her something amazingly great.

tried to change my myspace password to ""megadeathrocks""...
apparently that's too many letters.
lame.

i was in a play.

tea is good.
dragons are also pretty awesome.

"event","it's recently come to my attention that my work is ruining all aspects of my life.
i work six, sometimes seven days a week...nine to ten and a half hours on each of those days.
i'm not even full time either...i'm still consider a part time employee...which i don't understand at all.
i am making 6.90 right now with a .50 night premium that starts at 8pm.
so all in all i make 7.40
PLUS...since i work third shift...i am asleep for most of the day.

this all adds up to this.
i never have the chance to do anything else really besides work since i am either AT work, or tired all the time.
this in turn is ruining all aspects of a social life i could have, im coming down with some kind of sickness cold thing and i dont get the rest i need to fight it off, and my relationship with shannon is horribly suffering.

i've recently found out that i am getting moved to full time...but before we all shout for joy let's look at this for a second.

with full time i get:

free health
free dental
free vision
retirement plan

what i don't get:

a pay increase (what the fuck?)

...and the insurance benefits don't even kick in for like twelve weeks at the earliest.

i'm going to be third in charge...which means i am in charge of an entire crew when my boss isnt around, yet im still making the same amount of money as the people i'm in charge of...some even less than.

i am not requesting all the hours i am getting.
when i started i asked for 40 hours if they could give it to me...but less was fine.
now i am scheduled for 48 hours a week...but always working at least 1-2 hours overtime everyday.

the only day off i get this week is thanksgiving...which i am spending at my apartment by myself because everyone elses jobs allow them to go home to their families. (ie shannon and our roommates.)

awesome."

Shannon Martin: ""Hair is a constant project!""

work is going good.
i just stand around and listen to music all day and occasionally put something on a shelf.
i also was told yesterday that i am the only stock crew member that is worth a shit.
sweet.

right now i am waiting on a call to see if i can somehow go before work and do laundry...
which needs done so badly.

shannon has been really down lately because of school and stuff...
and i keep feeling like it is my fault...like i am not doing enough to help her.
i just dont know what to do.
i hope she knows that i love her so much...and i just want to see her succeed and be happy.

i think we need a vacation...to france...or something nice like that.

halloween party tomorrow.

so here's some stuff i've done in the past couple days.
give me your thoughts please.

<B>""Pulled Teeth and Arms of Diamond...""

wring out your shirt
the sweat from the night before
when we writhed and turned 
blistered and burned
then i caught that bus and ran away from everyone
Lord knows you're fashion at it's best
sunglasses big enough to hide any tears that would ever form

we all learn to pass on the alcohol
when it's pills we're trying to digest

i saw your face in a photograph
digital and pixelated
i am but a man
and you are nothing but a song in my head

i've passed up my chances
second looks and sideways glances
now i can't remember if what i saw was even real

you probably never even existed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

""...and we laughed as he was devoured""

father sea, what is to become of me?
mother earth, when will i be through?

done with the pain that fills my lungs as i gasp for air...
fighting to breathe.
nevermind my eager heart that yearns to hold warm bodies.
forget my lying eyes that ache to see a happy smile.

all i ever wanted to do was live
so i trusted when you told me...
""come into the water and stop staring at the waves.""

...and here i am now
washed out to sea and pleading...
""dear father, are you still not done with me?"""

"event","so i was going to go to the warped tour in Cinci this week.
change of plans.
shannon asked me if i could drop her off at whitney's @ 4:00am because she was going to see the Slayer/Manson show in Cleveland that day.
on my way back i was listening to some music...
i missed my exit and went at the next light to turn around...
and a cop pulled me over.
he said i was ""bobbing my head"" and he thought i was falling asleep/drunk/high/whatever.
he then found out my license is suspended...
and a five minute drive to whitney's and back to john's apartment turned into two days in jail.

lame.

jail is the worst thing ever...especially in louisville.
food sucks...people suck...conversation is slim to none...
and you can't sleep...because the lights are on the whole time.
i spent the whole first day sitting on the floor with no blanket and the AC cranked below freezing.
finally got a bed and a blanket and just layed there forever.
i never want to have to go there again...
straight and narrow for me from now on...
i am never doing anything ever again that would even maybe get me put back in there.
that is how bad i hated it.

imagine if you can...
it was a mexican guy who kidnapped some little girls, drug dealers, a transvestite hooker who posed as a police officer...and me.

awesome.

"event","i woke up in Knoxville, TN this morning.

this weekend has been absolutely the most amazing time of my life...hands down.
i wish i could get into my photobucket to post some pics which would make you understand more...but right now the connection is too low...so i can't...later though.

sam called me thursday and said she was coming up to hang out if i wanted to...
i said ""yes plz"".
she met anthony and i in corbin and the weekend of awesome proceeded.
thursday night we went to the catwalk...which is a big metal bridge underneath a stone bridge...about 400 feet up in the air over a river and some trees...
it was pretty awesome.
we met a pigeon...not a bat...as anthony thought.
then we went and watched conan the barbarian at aaron and brad's.
it was decided that james earl jones and anthony are NOTHING alike.
Friday we woke up and drove up to the shop to see macy...
i got some touch up work done and we ate McDonald's...
we also found out that Corbin doesnt have sweet tea...which is lame.
we then decided, after talking about haunted houses, that we wanted to go somewhere creepy...
so we went to the catwalk again because macy had never been.
took a lot of pictures...
then went to Big Mikey's.
we played some poker...wii sports...and then charades.
sam says she laughed so hard her face hurt.
all in all it was good times...
i got bit by a rattlesnake.

this was the point where sam was supposed to go home...
she had work at 10 the next morning.
somehow she wound up staying...and when i woke her up to see if she needed to call work she told me ""no""...but apparently she was asleep when she said this and would never say no to calling in to work.
so since she was here another whole day we decided to do something amazing.
we went down to the spillway for some hiking and cliff diving :D

we hiked all the way out to this really awesome waterfall...
anthony and i had to hike all the way back out to get a lighter for a fire...
(sprinting the whole time...bad idea)
we then decided that it would be fun to jump off of this cliff next to a waterfall...
the only problem is...you have to walk across the waterfall to get to the cliff to jump off...
the water fall leads to a bunch of rocks...and not deep water.
i cross first...sam crosses after me...and scares me because she slips a little.
brad then comes over and we all stand there and talk about how cold the water is going to be and try to decide who is going to jump first.
anthony says he will as soon as he gets over there...
i said as he was crossing ""watch...anthony will be the one to just fall straight down this waterfall""...which he did.

i was standing next to the edge of the falls getting a rock for some reason when i heard sam scream...i look up and anthony is sliding straight down the falls...and cant stop.
i lean down and try to brace myself...which is impossible since i am standing on wet moss.
i reached out as he was coming to the edge and grabbed his arm...and he pushed me away...
the last thing he said was ""i'm gone...""
and then he fell off the edge into the water.
we all thought he was dead...but somehow he managed to fall perfectly between two rocks and not kill himself.
i gashed open my ankle pretty bad...but all in all...we are both totally fine.
then we all jumped off the cliff...and i have never in my life been in water that cold...ever.
so after that whole ordeal we hiked back up to our camp and made a fire...
aaron showed up and ate all the hot dogs.
we found out how bad we suck at making smores.
took some more pictures...and then hiked out.

sam and i drove down here and watched some saved by the bell...
all is good."

Have you come to start a fight
Oh you say you won't, but you know you might
Push the living off and say:

I've been bitten by disease, my dear
The hurt has come within my heart
Should you say you know i might fall apart
So come darkness, shroud your end

i don't know why...
maybe it's the change of scenery...

whatever...
it's better than sleeping in the car again.

i got this really good book from half price books...
read a whole lot of it yesterday...
was planning on doing the same today while shannon was at work...
but then i realized i forgot it at the apartment when i left this morning.
you say to yourself...why doesn't he go back and get it?
well...it takes too long...and gas is expensive...and...i don't know...
but i am considering it...
because i think driving half of new circle is worth it for this book.

"event","so it turns out that i dont have the job at Babies ""R"" Us.
at the interview the manager said ""you are hired!""
but it turns out that a guy works there that i used to work with at PetSmart...and he hates me.
not for normal reasons...but reasons like ""he looks weird"", ""he has big holes in his ears"", ""blah blah blah"".
so he makes it a point to go to EVERY manager there and say ""dont hire this kid because i dont like him, and i dont want him here"".
they of course listen to him.
he also finds out that my roommate Brian works there and glares at him all day.
Brian goes up to him after finding out what happened and said, ""why would you do that?""
Douche responds by saying with a smile, ""...because i can"".

I call Babies ""R"" Us knowing nothing about all this, and ask when my orientation is...because at the interview when they said i was hired they told me the orientation was monday and they would call me and say when to come in.
They totally deny ever saying i was hired...even though on my folder they have there it even said ""HIRED""...but still they try to turn it around and say ""well maybe you were confused...or someone just got their wires crossed"".
Then after telling me they would see what was going on...the same girl that said i was hired calls me back...and says ""we just don't think you're a good FIT for this company""

I'm really tired of every place i try to get a job denying me because i look different.
No matter how much i try to change my image...i'm just getting sick of it.
I need a job because i have to pay for a place to live and food.
I can't survive off Shannon's kindness for the rest of my life.

it seems as though things for the past week have been really stressful.
i was constantly worried that shannon was going to leave me...
i had no job...or money...
i didn't know how i was going to pay rent...
recording was coming up for the band and i have no money to pay for it with...
but now i'm not really worried at all.

i had an interview at Babies ""R"" Us today.
they actually told me in the interview...
""we don't usually tell people we're interviewing that they are hired...we wait and call them...but we really like you...so you're hired""
i'm SO happy...you don't even know...

i finally feel like things are going the right direction.
i'm ready to party!

PS.

since around i think 9 i've been downloading songs...
and i think i have downloaded every song i could possibly want off the top of my head.
this day is great."

i sleepwalker merch!!  (that made me happy)
and tons more stuff that doesnt come to mind right now (not because it's not important...im just in a hurry)

i am just really happy in general.

so i just want to say...
i love all of the people that i have met in my life that i now call my friends.
all of you.
thank you so much for being a part of who i am today.

"event","Today Aya forced me out of bed and into nice clothes to attend some wedding cause he said I had to be there cause he was ""too sick"" to do it...

I don't even know the guy he looked like some gay hairdresser to me, but the bride was little miss Simca the pretty student of mine~ I made friends with the naked bartender Goyjo cause he had smokes, and of a good brand too. I was very lucky.

Seeing the wedding made me think of Asuka...and what could of happened ... I didn't see her in that light so why did I get flashes of her in that wedding dress? I told Schu-baby and Goyjo that I had to see Aya in truth....I needed to be alone I couldn't be there....

Anyway now that I'm home I'm tired so I don't think I'll make it to the bar, so I'm just going to bed.

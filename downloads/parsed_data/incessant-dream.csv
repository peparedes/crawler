"event","Hey guys! Man it sire is nice to be home at 1:30 in the afternoon! Sorry and yes I HAD to say that. I'm so glad my mom came to ""rescue"" me...I needed to get away. I'm excited about tomorrow though. I can just tell it's gonna be a good day! hmmmmm, let me see...is there a point to this entry...probably not, but that's ok I'm kinda bored, but I'd rather be bored at home than busy at school. Hmmm, well it's not like anyone really reads this anyway, well maybe with the exception of <lj user=""psychodorkgirl"">...WHICH I STILL HAVEN'T TALKED TO ONLINE!!!! lol, I'm j/k...I'm pretty sure we keep missing each other because of the time difference. What is it like 14 hours or sumthin...yeah kinda crazy, but that's ok the weekends should be good cuz I can stay on pretty late...well anyways this is pretty dumb, so I guess I'm gonna go!"

"event","I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lines
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real you know
Time for me to do it

Oh I start again go back to one
I'm running things my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm gonna take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm gonna keep it real you know
It's time for me to do it 
See I'm not afraid"

"event","9 things people do that piss me off (no I didn't write these, although I wish I had!)

1. People who point at their wrist while asking for the time.... I know 
where my watch is pal, where the fuck is yours? Do I point at my crotch when 
I ask where the toilet is? 

2. People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room for 
the tv remote because they refuse to walk to the tv and change the channel 
manually. 

3. When people say ""Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too"". Damn 
right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it? 

4. When people say ""it's always the last place you look"". Of course it is. 
Why the fuck would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do 
this? Who and where are they? Gonna Kick their ass! 

5. When people say while watching a film ""did you see that?"". No Loser, I 
paid $12 to come to the cinema and stare at the fucking floor. 

6. People who ask ""Can I ask you a question?"".... Didn't really give me a 
choice there, did ya sunshine? 

7. When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? 
If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an 
improvement, then there must have been something before it. 

8. When people say ""life is short"". What the fuck?? Life is the longest damn 
thing anyone ever fucking does!! 
What can you do that's longer? 

9. When you are waiting for the bus and someone asks ""Has the bus come 
yet?"". If the bus came would I be standing here, dumass?"

"event","My new favorite song, I just had to share this! It's called ""Hate Every Beautiful Day"" by Sugarcult. If you haven't heard it, I highly recommend it.

Something's gotta change again
I'm losing, my inspirations gone, oh no oh no
Seeing through some different eyes
I can't find, my medications failed, again again

I can feel a change
I can feel, can you feel it
See it on the street watching heat from the pavement

Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day

Faces in the crowd
Fake smiles for miles
My imitations wrong of them again
Trapped inside this cheap hotel
Bored as hell turing the channels 'round

I can feel a change
I can feel, can you feel it
See it on the street watching heat from the pavement

Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day

I can feel a change
I can feel, can you feel it
See it on the street watching heat from the pavement

I can feel a change
I can feel, can you feel it
I'm not the same, not the same lost my feeling

All I know I'll never know
All I know I'll never know

Cause I'm here, ready to take it all here
Everything's feeling unclear
I wish it was raining
Cause I hate every beautiful day
Every beautiful day
Every beautiful day
Every beautiful day"

Hey there people! OMG! Last night was FUCKING AWESOME!!!! It was by far the GREATEST night of my young life! I gotta kinda hurt though...my throat hurts from screaming the words to every song, my neck hurts from a little too much rockin and I burned my thumb with a lighter, but hey it's all good I LOVE BEING HURT!!!! lol, as long as it's at a GC show, I have no complaints! Not only that, my Dad looked awesome in his MADE shirt, with his newly dyed black hair and pink goatee! Let's just say we attracted alot of attention! I also got to meet my wife Shannan for the first time last night! It was awesome. She's a great person and I'm glad I'm getting to know her better! Can't wait til Spring Break! We're gonna be hangin out bunches! I just wish she didn't live so far away...

Well last night I bought a T-shirt, wrist band and a pack of buttons, they're all VERY cool! Sorry I'm still a little pumped, yes even 24 hours since it started yesterday, lol! 

Ya know I love the fact that now when I hear a GC song I get this image in my mind of them up there on stage just puttin on a great show! I love it! I know it's crazy but I still get chills and goosebumps when I hear them! lol, well I just thought I'd let <lj user=""psychodorkgirl""> know how it went, since I think she's the only other GC fan that reads this. HAPPY BELATED GC DAY!"

I however am leaving at 4:00 pm. I'm very excited that I will finally meet my wife Shannan! lol...n/m...anyhoot, I just thought you all should know that there is a very good chance that I will get no sleep tonight, considering this is ten times bigger than Christmas to me so there is a very good possibility that I will be on AIM ALL night...although I hope I'm not just becuz I will be so dead tomorrow...Whatever. If you can't tell I seem to be in one of my weird moods and have come to the realization that this entry is completley pointless.

Well not completely...I want to remind Stephanie, Amy, Cassie, and whoever elses cell phone # I can find, to leave their phone on overnight becuz at 6 am I will calling to wish you all a very happy Good Charlotte Day! That's right folks, I have personally declared tomorrow a holiday! 

I have also decided that in the spirit of things, the only music I will be listening to over the next 22 hours will be Good Charlotte. I highly recommend all of you to join me in this joyous celebration! 

Goodnight everyone, and please get enough sleep for me too, becuz god knows I wont be doing much of that over the next few days!"

""I used to work at target until I went to this work function with a tuxedo painted on my naked body, punch spilled, long story."" 

""I have a confession to make: I love making out. It's fun and innocent. And besides, you can't get pregnant from making out."" 

""Benji is life...all the rest is just details... Life is Benji"" 

""You know who else likes mking out? Sum 41.  I know first-hand... Or my friend does...""

""Have  we  ever murdered  a  boy band? YES! There  was  a band called P-Town, and  we  shot them!"" 

""This is the makeout song. Although you should ask the person first, 'cause I've had some troubles with that before."" 

""What's my official statement? My official statement is... that I've been wearing the same underwear for the the past four days!"" 

""I am thinking about getting a job here."" (about Wet Seal)

""We're all gonna run around naked and make animal noises!""

I think those are all from Benji...aren't those great?! Ummm...ok...maybe it's just me...and the fact that I have yet to go to sleep...but hey who knows...

Um...I also fixed the background in my journal so for those of you who looked last time and didn't see anything try again...It's fixed!!!

Wish me luck t/m is the BIG day! I'll update again t/m and let you know how it goes!

You are someone who searches for things long and hard that will satisfy your appetite for  knowledge, whether it be from books or for your own life. If you read the line up to the word  appetite and didn't crack up thinking there was a sick pun, then you more than likely fit into this  category, or at least the being intelligent part. May your searches go well but remember, sometimes  the most obvious things are right under your nose.

<font face=""Jester"" size=""3"">50 Things Girls Wished Guys Knew...
 

1)You have to tell a girl how you feel about her...we make no assumptions.
2)It never hurts to work out...take your own advice.
3)Girls like sex just as much, if not more than guys.
4)Not all girls masturbate...we just don't and no we are not lying.
5)We hate porn.
6)Hmmmm...guys in Jeeps...yummmm...
7)Girls need food, water, and compliments to survive.
8)We think about you all the time.
9)Being able to make us laugh is so much more important than how much you can bench-press.
10)We may think you are gay if you wear tighty-whities on a regular basis.
11)Hold our hand.
12)No backseat drivers...NONE.
13)Girls generally don't like giving head, so you better be ready to reciprocate if and when you get it.
14)We are not your all-night restaurant.
15)Anything we say or do during that 4 days to a week each month cannot be held against us.
16)If you hold our hand while you are driving we will be thoroughly impressed...especially if it's a stick.
17)Under no circumstances will we have a threesome.
18)You look hot in hooded articles of clothing.
19)If you think for any reason that we don't like you then we probably don't.
20)Having us over while you and your friends play video games does not count as ""quality time"".
21)Just because we groom ourselves on a regular basis does not mean we're high maintanance.
22)Never comment on how much a girl eats...ever.
23)Keep in mind that we withold sex when we're mad at you, so you might wanna get around to apologizing...
24)You just can't force us to like sports...especially those associated with the WWF.
25)We're typically smarter than you...so get over it and stop whining when we get better grades than you.
26)If you do not own a wife-beater, stop reading this list, and go invest in one...right now.
27)The ability to play the guitar will help you get laid.
28)We're sorry, Brad Pitt just IS hot...get over it!!!
29)Walks in the rain, kisses on the forehead, and cooking dinner for us will get you everywhere.
30)Just because we're in a serious relationship doesn't mean we plan to marry you someday, so stop being so damn scared!!!
31)If you're developing such good finger skills playing video games, you better put them to good use sometimes.
32)Anything you do or say to another girl that you wouldn't want us to know about is considered cheating.
33)If we can admit that we're wrong, you'd better be able to do the same.
34)The excuse ""I can't dance"" is unacceptable...we'll appreciate the simple fact that you're trying.
35)On that note, if you refuse to dance, expect us to dance with other guys...and lots of them.
36)Think before you speak...it'll make a world of difference.
37)Not all girls kiss on the first date, get over it...we're creatures of mystery.
38)Make fun of our clothes...prepare to die.
39)We don't always expect you to pay for us, but it doesn't hurt to at least offer everyone once in a while.
40)Tell us we're beautiful.
41)The ""little things"" in a relationship are really the biggest.
42)Foreplay isn't something we should have to ask for...it's a prerequisite.
43)Don't screw us over...especially if we have an older brother or protective guy friends...they will hunt you down and kill you.
44)If you're gonna look at other girls, at least make sure we don't see you do it.
45)Just because we're still just ""hanging out"" doesn't make it ok to sleep with your ex-girlfriend, friend with benefits, etc.
46)No girl just wants to be your ""friend with benefits"".
47)We're sensitive too...be gentle (and we're not talking about our hearts here guys).
48)One word when it comes to smoking...quit.
49)We reserve the right to hate all of your ex-girlfriends.
50)If we happen to trip, fall, etc, while wearing the exceptionally high shoes that we love, go ahead and laugh...we will be...that is unless we hurt ourselves..."

"event","<font face=""Jester"" size=""2"">Hey Guys!!!! Wow...a real entry!!!! Yippee!!! Ok, first off I wanna say thanks to ALL of my friends...you guys are great and whether you know it or not I couldn't have gotten through this whole Brandon thing without you. I may not have seemed to be taking it very hard...or maybe I was...but never the less last week was one of the hardest things I've ever gone through and whether you all realize it or not, it's because of you guys that I feel as strong and as happy as I do right now. The smallest things like calling or going out with me...anything...it kept my mind off of it.You also knew when I needed to talk and did that with me too...and I can't thank you all enough! 

Moving right along...yes I finally feel like I'm over him. You guys probably think I'm nuts because it was only like a month and half that we had really been close but most of you know that I'm very sensitive and get emotionally attached very quickly...so if you try to see it from my point of view I'm sure you'd understand. 

I feel so different right now...this sounds kinda dramatic and cliche' but I feel really happy and new...lol...ok...I'm a dork...but seriously...I think that Brandon was a good learning expierience for me...and whether it sounds stupid or not, I'm glad I went through it all...

I got this in my e-mail the other day and it really made me kinda okay with the fact that Brandon came and went so quickly...I don't expect you all to read this but it's kinda nice if ya do...
When someone is in your life for a REASON. . . It is usually 
to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist 
you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and 
support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. 
They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for 
the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing 
on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say 
or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes 
they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and 
force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our 
need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. 
The prayer you sent up has been answered. And now it is time 
to move on. 

So thanks again guys! I love you all!!!  

Love Always~

I also hope that everyone has had a good break because in case anyone has forgotten it's over in 2 days!!! I'm not so sure I'm happy about that anymore...but whatever.
As for me I think I'll just post some song lyrics about how I've been feeling these past 2 weeks...

 
                     Spend your lazy, endless crazy days, inside my head, 
             You're so selfish, you're not the only one who thinks he's dead 
              I'm paid to smile, now I'm on trial for what you think I said 
                     But I never said that everything would be ok, 
                  And I never said that we would live to see another day 

                     
                     Motivate me, I wanna get myself out of this bed, 
                   Captivate me, I want good thoughts inside of my head, 
           If I fall down would you come around and pick me right up off the ground 

                           
                          I'm realistic, and un-artistic,
                           You say I'm selfish and absurd 
                       You try to change me, you try to save me 
                       You say I'm gonna learn, I'm so blind, 
                   I'm out of time, You're so unkind sometimes, 
                      I never lied, I never lied, I never lied
          Cuz I never said that everything would be ok, and I never said that we live to                                see another day..

                               
                             'Cause everything it'll be ok, 
                         You know we're gonna live to see another day


In case anyone is curious the song is called Motivation Proclamation by Good Charlotte"

"event","<font face=""Jester"" color=""magenta"" size=""2"">Every day passes,
Reminding me of lesons to be learned.
Opportunities pass me by, 
Showing me things to be earned.

I do not know life as an adult sees it,
Only as a child and teen.
I can only guess what life is meant to be,
Based on what I've seen.

Today I learned of love,
And the pain that it may bear.
You can never know a persons truth,
Behind the masks they wear.

I do not know the meaning of love,
Or why it is never true.
I'm unsure of so many things these days,
I know less than I thought I knew.

I find it's getting difficult,
To distinguish bad from good.
And although it sounds cliche',
I'm a child misunderstood.

I need to move on past the hurts, 
Move to heaven from this hell.
I need to stand up to others, 
And to myself as well.

I don't know how to tell,
A good friend from a bad.
We talk behind each other's backs,
Ruining the trust we had.

When I stare into the mirror, 
I see things I wish I could deny.
A fear of judgement and confrontation,
I can no longer look myself in the eye.

If everybody has to go, 
Through torment and through pain.
If they understand the hurt,
That is another's gain.

If they can feel,
The burden of their fears.
And know the cost,
Of showing their tears.

If they know how it feels,
To have a lover or friend.
Stab their backs with knives,
Why are they so cruel to say
These are the best years of our lives?"

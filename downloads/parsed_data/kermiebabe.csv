"event","Conversation is, by nature, a creation of a scene or from the feeling that people get from expression of their opinions. That sounds a little complicated, but that's my view on it.&nbsp; Effectively one is creating a memory or a basis for springboarding and extending their views on a given topic. For this reason, it's integral to conversation that disagreement occurs. How often have you had a conversation with someone and felt uncomfortable because all you want is to pick on what they're saying (within reason, of course) and discuss it further, with some contrariness thrown in for good measure? Or for them to pick on something you've said, because all you want is a bit of a heated discussion?! I often wish this was the case, and it would seem that we're losing the ability to disagree with people on even terms. By this, I think what I actually mean is that we're getting too PC. Politically correct. This leads us to think that we may insult someone because of something we will say, so we're afraid to even say it. So we don't even get to the stage of disagreement because we're living in fear that we'll be faced with unwanted conflict. Which is probably not an unreasonable fear, seeing as the thought of getting abused, verbally or physically, doesn't tend to be one that thrills us (unless you're a bit of a masochist). But then, what is the problem with actually telling someone what you think? Rather than lying and saying that you disagree with something, why don't you be honest with this person? There's no harm in it, because we're all different, and what we believe is what we believe. Plus, they'll know where you stand, and if they're not happy with it, they won't go there again. It's a learning experience for both.

But the problem lies in gauging someone('s personality) based on single conversations. It would seem that many of us (or is it just me? I'm sure it's not, and I'll explain why later) are ready to judge people based on the way they respond to us and what we say. Rather than stimulating them or provoking them to respond in a particular way or even respond at all, we're happy just to let them be and move on. A lot of these people are the people we work with or study with, and it can become quite awkward because one ends up not being sure of what to say around them. I tend to be a strong reader of body language, so I can get carried away with reading into it and therefore becoming cautious of what I say next. It is for this reason I don't believe it's just me who feels like this. Surely I'm not the only person who reads body language so intensely, and thus forms opinions of people based on this? It's a dangerous spectator sport to get into, although when it's the body language between other people that you're reading it can actually be quite interesting. For example, I was sitting at a cafe last weekend when a couple came and sat down at the table next to me. I was alone with my coffee and my study notes, and although I was meant to be focussed on these notes, I couldn't help but notice that the man kept looking around at everything but his girlfriend. I thought this was interesting body language, but I guess it couldn't be helped because she was intently reading a magazine of some sort, so he obviously felt a bit left out. However, when they got up to go, I realised that the magazine his girlfriend was reading was actually a wedding magazine! It just struck me as strange that such body language should occur between two people who were about to make some very serious vows! Perhaps it was just a once-off, or that they were in public, but I would have thought that at least he would have been interested in what was going on, because if I'd been the girlfriend I would have been very, well, most likely, irritated by such behaviour. Mind you, I'd make a bit of a joke about it, and I'm sure there's more to any relationship than meets the eye (a good sex life can often be the key!), so I was probably reading more into it than necessary. But at least if I was to pick on my boyfriend I'd be achieving 1./ honesty, and 2./ conversation!"

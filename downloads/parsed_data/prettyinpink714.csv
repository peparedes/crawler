so, now my mom is going to go buy me a Dutch Kitchen cake! and I'm having tacos for dinner! :]

Tomorrow I think I might be adventurous and go to the gym after my classes, maybe go running on the track or something.  Cuz I'm getting fat, and I have to be good looking by June.

what would you do on a friday night? go see your school play Hamlet? you got it, I hate my english professor.
saturday, I was going to go skiing, but I decided to go to hockey instead, which I ended up missing because my mom read the wrong time on the schedule :[ and I felt bad because my auntie T came from auburn to play and she didn't, but I got to see sammy and tayla, they're so cute!
yesterday, I had to work, it was ok, I don't think the girls there like me all that much. Then I went out with my aunts, my sis, and one of my cousins. I had an ok time.
And today Kevin and I were suppose to go skating this morning, but because of the lovely new england weather, we didn't.  Hopefully I'll get to see him as he makes his way to school.

maybe this weekend will be better.

Last night, after a terrible day at work, I went to Kevin's Family party.
I got a really cute, really cool funky sweater, but its too small :( hopefully I can get a bigger size
and I got a really cute, really pink sweat shirt, which was too small as well. These mediums, ain't no mediums.
BUT. I got a a really cute tinker bell fleece throw (which is very warm) and a mug that matches it.
a cook book?
and my favorite, Kevin made me a bear! and it says I Love You!

Today, I got some cool stuff. I got speakers, a couple of pocket books, a few cute sweaters, a cape cod necklace, gloves, a shovel and scraper, windshield washer fluid (YAYA!) antique ornaments, an italian charm bracelet, a tea pot ornament, a cute pink fun fur scarf, and a bunch of other stuff including mooola

tomorrow I have to work all day, ick ick ick, : after christmas sales + cheap old ladies = a truly crappy, awful, annoying, and everything you can imagine kind of day. But at least I'll be dressed in some cute clothes :) and lovely jewelry :]

and monday is 6 months :) and I shall be spending the entire day (weather permitted) with Kevin!

You know I love you! :)

it's just been a bad weekend.

My knee has been killing me, cuz of stupid work,  everything has revolved around my uncle's stupid wedding.  Which was depressing.  Spending my anniversary at a wedding without him, my pepe and meme telling me they wish he could have come.  No one to dance with, my aunt balling her eyes out, I just felt like shit.  And today I felt like shit, I still didn't get to see him, and that's all I wanted.  and who knows when I'll see him next seeing how I'm working 35 hours this week.  and of course it just has to be everyday, wednesday through sunday...

I'm working 3-9:30 tomorrow and Wednesday. Thursday will be a long day, Auburn, and then off to Wilberham (or however you spell it) which I probably won't get home from there until midnight. Then I'm working friday, 8-5, then I have to be in worcester by 7 for my uncle's wedding rehearsal. And then Saturday is the wedding.  Followed by Sunday, working 1-9.

Yup, I'll be tired.

at least I'll be getting a sweet pay check! :] unfortunately $150 will be going to my stupid insurance.

I really really really really want that cedar chest.  If I make a good amount of money in the next few weeks I think I'm going to buy it.  It's calling my name, I can't just simply pass it up!

I only have a handful of things left to pick up for christmas gifts.  I'm so excited. This is going to be the best christmas ever!

I'm on cookie duty Wednesday morning.  So stay out of my kitchen! :P

I love the Pepsi Holiday Spice stuff... It's so yummy!

bed time!

"event","Upon the subject of world threats, I find that Sin was not unique in this regard to Spira. It also seems that my eternally chirpy wife was also responsible for the irradication of said second threat. A large machina, I knew those would always amount to trouble, for this very reason, named Vegnagun. And, so I say to you, congratulations, Yuna. Not only have you exposed all of Olde Yevon's secrets, you have used said secrets to further your definition of 'hero'.

If you will excuse me, I believe that it is time to attempt to learn of this ""New"" Yevon. As I have heard, the old religion, as well as the Maesters who fueled such, are quite dead, and the Fayth continue to hold reluctance towards reaquainting themselves to the world of Spira. Which, brings me to ponder: What shall my new role be? I have been dutifully resurrected by the Fayth, and I hold guidance from my mother as honor to their intent.

I suppose, by extention, honor of my own intent, as my existance relies solely on upholding the word of the Fayth. I realise that some will be slow to trust me, but, in time, I do hope to prove my determination in doing good for the people of all Spira. Indeed, it was always my ambition to make her denizens, whether they be Guado, Human, or Al Bhed, content to live without fear or discomfort.

In time, my good people of Spira, I am certain that I shall atone and repent for my sins. I merely inquire that I can so such in the servitude of the public eye, assisting whatever equivalent we have to temples, or leaders, in this new Spira.

Respectfully,
The former Master Seymour Guado"

"event","So I was thinking about this after my friend brought this discussion up...

So lets say Jesus didn't come 2000 years ago and he still has to come.  If he came today and claimed he was The Messiah, would you believe him?  I was reading this article about this guy I guess named Jesus who claims he is the ""one"" and he has been traveling around and has followers and everything.  So that got me and my friend to thinking.  If Jesus still had to come, and someone claimed they were Jesus, would you believe him? Now after a while,I'm sure some of us would by the signs and wonders that he does.  But now, with technology and magic going around, people are able to walk on water like Chris Angel does when he performs for people in Las Vegas.  Chris Angel can perform miraculous signs that make you sit there and wonder how he does it.  How many of us would wonder if this guy Jesus was the real one that is to come.  I found my self answering this question and I honestly don't know.  Would I only believe it was Jesus by his miracles?  How do you have faith in a guy that so many other people claim they are as well.  

I just thought this was interesting.  Tell me what you think and what your views are on it.

Peace,

I took a little fall at Josh's house last night...well actually out of my car. lol.  My ankle is a little bit swollen so I'm delaying my packing. lol.  We have a wedding to go to today so we will see what I can do.

I decided to pack lightly for school.  After 2 years of going you kind of realize what you really need and what you really don't need.  I'm leaving a lot home.  We will see how that works out. ha ha. 

Well time to try and bring stuff downstairs...Hopefully I won't fall. lol.

I've been working a ton this summer already.  I'm ready for a break. lol.  Josh was talking about getting a bible study started again.  We were wondering if anyone would be interested in doing that.  If you are, sweet!

Nothing else is really new with me.  Just working and coaching and stuff.  I get to go to my lake house tomorrow and i'm sooooo incredibly thrilled! woot woot. Charlie is living with us this summer.  Hes going to be a senior at Carthage.  He is coaching with me and my bro. If you guys haven't met him, you should come over some time. he's a cool guy.  

but yeah thats about it.  Nothing going on with me.  Hope you guys are all having a good summer though.

Me and Emily were best friends since she moved next door to me when I was in 1st grade.  She left yesterday to go to her summer camp, then her family is moving in August because her dad got a call out to Indiana.  Hopefully we will be able to see each other during the school year since i will have a car and she is an hour away.  It just.....stinks.

The pool opened today.  it's been fun.  The people there are all really nice to hang out with.  I feel that work is my ""reach out"" zone. lol.  Hopefully I can continue doing that all summer.

"event","I sometimes wonder this...If someone asks you to hold them accountable for something, and you agree to it...and somewhere in there the person who wants accountability gives into something...and doesn't want to stop what he is doing.  Yeah it is their fault, but would the accountability person have any fault in the matter.  They were asked to do something which they tried to hold true and help them. Who would be at fault there?  The person who needs accountability, or the person that said they will hold them accountable?

I have recently been put on the executive board of christian ministry on campus and i am thrilled I am there...but there is this thought in my head that I don't feel like i'm ready for it.  I'm not sure if this is a thought from the devil to make me doubt myself, but I'm trying to figure that out.

As a leader now, I have soooo much work to do.  Everyday i have something new to plan for and to attend to.  It kind of sucks, but then again, I am meeting someone everyday.  

Thats kind of where I am at right now...Just trying to finish up the year without losing it.  

My small group had a discussion last night about verses and issues in the bible that are unclear.  I have a Catholic girl in my small group who does great things on campus for us.  She is amazing and such a role model. We all talked to her last night about what they believed in.  She prays to Mary and Saints and she is debating if she really truly believes in purgatory.  But she believes in mortal sins and all that stuff.  I'm just so confused as to where Catholics came up with some of these ideas.  They aren't biblical and if anyone has info on it, let me know.  She does remain strong in her beliefs but i respect her for them because she doesn't have to defend her beliefs.  She accepts people don't like her beliefs and still believes them anyways.  So if you guys know where some of this came from, let me know. i'm interested.


Time for me to go finish up some papers.

I feel so busy for the next 4 weeks. I have 33 pages of papers that have to be written soon, along with a movie i have to produce, direct, and make.  Oh and who can forget my summer job that is starting even before i get home so i have to worry about making up extra training. boo.

We had our water polo regionals last weekend. it was so intense. We make it to the championship game and we ended up going into double overtime in which Macalester beat us :(.  Everyone was really sad.  We were hoping to win and we beat the the day before so we were hoping to beat them again. But I'm kinda glad polo is over.  Just kinda adds to the stress.

I'm hoping to get a good roommate next year.  Her name is Randi.  I've been praying about whether or not i should room with a christian or a non christian.  I believe a christian would help me and keep me more accountable since I will be part of the Exec Board next year and I will be busy with the ministry on campus.  Which this situation adds to the high school drama since people on this floor feel it necessary to talk about anything and everything.  I dunno. people.

I had to watch my friend Ashley get told today that her brother committed suicide this morning. To see the look on her face and see her sister and her youth pastor on our floor telling her this.  What can you do?  I couldn't do anything other than stand there and watch her fall down screaming.  I've never been around  or known anyone who has committed suicide that I knew really well, but to watch someone who loved her brother dearly just cry her eyes out and scream just makes you want to fall down right next to her and cry.  I wish that none of you have to go through something like this.

I'm not really sure how to help her right now.  Other than being there for her and praying for her.  

I just want to ask you guys to keep Ashley and her family in your prayers for the next few weeks. It's going to be quite hard around here.

"event","Alright guys...Need your advice/opinion/what you think about this situation....

Alright, so here it is....Remember I was talking earlier in the year about Rebecca who was causing a little rumble in the way she practiced tongues and all that drama? Well,  Come to here that one of my friends Randi, was going to talk to her and have a ""meeting"" about the way Rebecca has been treating her and fix some problems.  So Randi starts out by saying a few things that were on her heart.  She said some stuff...and every time she finished saying something she felt, Rebecca would say, your heart is deceiving you and your thoughts are wrong.  She would say your heart is feeling like this because you are hanging out with the wrong people.  Or, God makes you feel those things in your heart because you fell away from him.  That brought up an interesting issue right there....

...Rebecca is a girl who considers herself always kinda right.  Randi came to her and said that Rebecca needs to stop convicting her and start encouraging her.  Rebecca said no and that she needs to be convicted because in Prov 19-21, thats what God says to do.  So rebecca told her once again that she is wrong and her heart is deceiving her...again...

...So here is the next problem with her...I found out that they (rebecca and her friends) are trying to hold a worship at the same time as a normal worship here at campus.  She told people that she doesn't believe God is present at the normal worship and is now making people decide between which worship to go to.  It's kinda weird.  I mean, Is she trying to build the body up or tear it down?  Not only that, but at the worships she leads, I found out that they speak in tongues ALOT.  I'm just so confused on what is going on here.

So Rebecca ends this meeting by saying God told me that I am right and that Randi that everything she said was pretty much wrong and twisted it to make Randi the bad person.  Rebecca even told Randi not to spend time with some non-christian friends and a non christian guy she likes because her motifs are wrong.  I'm telling you.....Rebecca has a few friends who WORSHIP her.  It's kinda scary.  One girl does her dishes every week because she feels God blessed her with doing dishes-which she loves doing-so she is going to use her gifts for Rebecca and do her dishes and laundry every week.  I don't know how I feel about that.  

So...

Does anyone have anything that I could do to help this situation??? I want to talk to Rebecca and try to straighten this out, but there is no way I can do that.  She knows where EVERYTHING in the bible is.  She tore Randi apart with the Bible, and honestly, I can't go against that.  I might have good knowledge of the Bible, but she will just tear you apart.  This is a big deal because it's definitely tearing the body apart.  The gossip of what they do at worships and what they say to non christians are going around.  

So I mean, they are christians.  I know that.  I know they are passionate about it, but what is going on???  How could a Christian like that claim they know everything and say that ""God tells me I am right and correct about what I believe""?  What should I do in this situation?  Go to authority???  I mean, she has her friends who practically worship her and they believe she is close to God.  

Any comments on what i should do or what should happen, let me know...This is really buggin me!!!!  

Thanks
Peace

"event","So....tonight....A hypnotist came to carthage.  Guess who decided to go up there to be one of his ""victims"".  Yep. Yours truly :)  It was quite interesting.  He put us all to sleep and after that I don't remember too much.  But I do remember waking up and going off stage.  Next thing you know, my friends are all up in my face saying ""you were so hilarious when you took the speakers microphone and broke out in song singing 'I'm a slave 4 u'""  I could not believe what i did.  I guess he had me break out in a song and act like i'm a singer everytime he said the word 'blue'.  It was crazy.  But for the most part other than that i guess it didn't work on me. i do remember funny parts where people were acting like dogs and doing cool stuff for a dog show.  it was crazy.  

So for the most part, I didn't believe that you could be hypnotized.  But I mean, I don't really agree with doing that stuff.  But I had to try it out to see it for myself.  But then I realized there was a lot of good stuff that you could do with being hypnotized.  The speaker who came is very famous in his work and has made cds that you can buy and you can hypnotize yourself to stop smoking or stop drinking or reduce stress.  There is even a cd that you can do for 20 minutes and when you wake up after it's over, you feel like you had a good night's rest for the full 8 hours.  There is even one to make you lose weight.  Its kinda crazy.  So i mean, it does help for other things other than someone making you do stupid things, which I learned tonight.  I guess I even started crying on stage cuz I thought a water bottle was floating in mid-air.  One experience was enough for me to realize what this really is.

Thought I would share it with you.
Oh, and add your thoughts on what you think about hypnotism.  I use to think that it was satanic. lol . but I mean, I think i was just looking at it the wrong way

"event","It has been a while since I have posted so here it goes...

I have been taking a psychology of stress class for the past 3 weeks.  And I have realized there seems to be a lot of things wrong with me. lol.  For example:  I have found out almost all of my fears.  I figure I would share a few with you.
1) of course I am afraid of flying.  I think it is more I am afraid of dying.  But flying just scares the pee right out of me.  
2) I am afraid of losing those I love.  I think a lot of people are afraid of that one too.
3) I am afraid of toilets.  I don't know why, but I just can't sit down on toilets anymore!  No offense if I don't sit on your toilet, but I have just turned into a germaphobe! It gets frustrating
4) Heights.  I am a little bit afraid of heights.  I don't feel safe and secure.  I think thats also why I'm afraid of planes
5) Claustrophobic.  Yep, I hate closed spots.  

It is really interesting.  I have too many fears.  I worry more about what is going to happen than enjoying my life.  I know that isn't healthy.  I want to try escaping from these fears, but I'm not too sure where to start. I have been reading up on things like, if you are afraid of planes, and you put the person in the plane, it will only make their phobia even worse. So I can't just get on a plane and be ok.  Any suggestions?

I was listening to Pastor Brians sermon online.  And I realized alot.  I realized that all of us have been pushing our limits.  We have been getting as close as we can to the edge without  ""sinning"".  We have been pushing limits saying that it is ok to do certain things.  We try to validate what we do.  We try to justify it saying that it is ok to do.  Until we realize, we don't have anymore limits.  Until we look pack and realized we pushed the limit, farther, and farther, and farther, until people just don't care anymore.  I hope that we can realize what we are doing.  I mean, I know what I am doing and I want to change.  But then, I know things are going on with other people, but I don't know if they want to change at all.  This last weekend, I got tricked into going to a party.  I brought Katie, Loreena, and my friend Brittany to this place.  I was hoping that their would be a bunch of people there not drinking.  Well we get there, and I didn't know this, but the reason my friends wanted me to bring them, was because they wanted to get drunk.  So as i am sitting there alone at this party, it just started really depressing me.  I was sitting there thinking, ""these people look like idiots"".  I didn't enjoy every single other person there drinking and being hit on and tackled by drunk people.  So I actually called my brother half an hour after I got there, and I begged him to come pick me up.  I was surprised that he actually would come and get me from a party, since I thought he would himself be out at a party.  Going to that party made me realize how stupid drinking really is.  I was sober and there were drunks who tried hitting on me and people who were flirting with me and other guys telling my friends to bend over so they can see a better view.  Idiots.


If you knew how long you would live, would that affect how you spend your life?  If you knew that you had 34 years, or 50 years, or 2 days left to live, do you think you would change what you are doing right now?  What would you do?  Would you ""live like you were dying"" or would you live it for God?  I'm just curious to see.  Would you be proud of the way you lived your life if you died in a year?  Or would you just be proud of the way you lived your life the last year?  

Grace and Peace,

2 weeks and I come home for christmas break.  That means, finals are in 1 week! I convinced 2 of my teachers to let us have our final earlier so I didn't have to stay here on a friday afternoon still taking the final.  One final includes making a video-Illegal Immigration.  This should be interesting.  I found an illegal immigrant the other day.  I wanted to interview him, but I didn't want him to get in trouble. haha.

For those who haven't visited me this year at school, you should come up.  There are some pretty good sledding hills around and plenty of places for you to sleep.  

Time to go videotape katie while she is sleeping. hehe. practical jokes....gotta love 'em.

p.s.  Ok so what do you think.  how about, we all get together around christmas and have a christmas party??? like have a white elephant gift and drink some eggnog (even though i hate it) and chill together??? if you are up for this let me know. I think it would be fun!"

"event","This has been by far the most interesting week of my life.  I don't know how many of you guys know this story, but I just got done talking with Jason Baker.  I know most of you guys are thinking so what, it's just baker.  Well 2 weekends ago he left Carthage to go to his girlfriends place in Iowa and never came back.  He contacted me last night and told me that he is coming back today to pick up his stuff and then he is leaving and never coming back.  This didn't hurt me as much as some other people...like his best friend and roommate.  I helped his roommate pack up all of his stuff last night and I was afraid that he was going to just break down and cry or something.  But it just made me sad all night.  So baker left.  Claims that he was being fake at Carthage, and says he has a job in iowa and wants to get married to his girlfriend and what not.  It's just wierd.  He left his leadership as a small group leader, intervarsity cordinator, and worship leader because he felt God calling him somewhere else.  I don't know what to think of that.  This whole situation just bothers me a little bit.  I just don't know.

I'm coming home this friday because I have a doctors appt about my jaw on saturday.  If any of you guys are open to hang out that would be wonderful for me.  I'm sick of being down in the dumps.  So if you guys are doing something friday night or if something is going on just let me know.  Thanks

"event","I am upset with myself.  My Aunt Jerry died yesterday.  Actually she was my great aunt.  She was my grandma's sister.  I don't know who my grandmother was since she died before i was born, but my aunt jerry was someone who I based my grandma off of since they were sisters.  I imagine they were close with the same close personality.  I saw my aunt jerry 3 times in the past 2 years.  before then, I would see her every month.  My family was soo incredibly close with her and everyone else.  But then last year we found out she was dying.  We all kinda stopped seeing her.  I saw her 1 time in the past year.  So she pretty much died alone.  No one could make it out to see her because we were always too busy.  It just saddens my heart to think that.  She died alone. I don't know what would be going through my head if I had to die alone.  

I'm having trouble with people at school.  Well mostly the leaders of intervarsity.  My roommate along with some other friends don't want to attend worship anymore because the whole tongues issue and it makes them feel uncomfortable.  I am trying my hardest to do what I can do about it but the other leaders are pretty much telling me to just shut my mouth and not make a big deal of it.  But it hurts because I know it's biblically wrong but no one will listen to me.  if it happens when I am there and no one wants to listen to me, then I am just going to have to leave and take myself away from that kind of group.  

Sorry theres a lot on my mind.  Alot of tests, midterms, a funeral, doctors appts and what not.  One good thing I guess would be that i played water polo yesterday.  It felt so good.  It felt good to let my frustration out on a ball.  We are going to have such a good team this year.  Our goal is to make it to nationals out in California.  I do not know if i will make the traveling team or not but I will try my hardest.  I just want to improve and do my best....now that I know how to play and everything.  

My mom told my coach that I was doing swimming next year.  That made me really mad.  It just makes me mad that people have to speak for me.  No one listens to me.  Whether it is dealing with Intervarsity or my mom.  They just don't listen.  I'm kinda just there....it makes me sad."

"event","I actually have 2 prayer requests to share with you tonight....first of all.  My friend Sarah.  most of you guys have met her.  She is 95% focused on swimming and 5% focused on God.  She has been having back problems and she just threw her back out again tonight.  She feels like her potential and swimming is going to be over.  She believes that all she has to make her who she is is swimming.  I just ask that you guys could pray that she kinds the strength she needs not only in medicine and therapy, but in God too.  God is stripping her of who she thinks she is showing her that that isn't really who she is.  She doesn't realize that though.  Just pray that she can open her eyes and see who she is in Him.

My second prayer request...its not really a prayer request...but...I went to go change some water out of my fish tank.  And well.  I looked in to notice my pink fish, Mystery, was not doing so well.  Laying on his side.   HIS EYES POPPED OUT!!!!  They are huge now.  probably close to the size of your pinky nail.  But he isn't doing so hot.  Floating on the top, but he is still alive.  Even though he is only a fish, I still love him and I just pray that he makes a quick transition soon.  I hope his pain goes away.  but then again, I have heard some fish don't feel pain, But i don't think he is one of them.  It makes me sad.  I am sad.  i hate when things i love die.  :(


I'm coming home this weekend.  I'm hoping to get together with a few of you guys to talk.  I've kinda been opening my eyes a lot while I am indulging in God up at school.  realized where i was going and what I need to be doing.  I was thinking the other night of who to call.  Who from home could I call and talk to.  I remember at one point I could call anyone from home.  any of the 30 people who were involved in 2:42 to talk.  But now...I think I can think of 3 people.  I wish we were closer.  I wish things did happen the way they did. But everything happens for a reason.  Maybe we fell apart only to meet new people and make a new group.  I don't really know.

I also asked her about my jaw problems and she said I do have to go to a doctor for that one.  And then she took my temperature and of course I have a fever.  I guess things do come in 3's

For those who don't know how I got a concussion...just ask printz or josh...or I guess Lee too.  Just a little bump on the head from hitting my fish tank and a hole in the tank which led to water pouring out of it which luckily the guys saved my fish.  For a better story, just ask josh.

And I sat there for 25 minutes while they played around with the needle trying to open my vain up.  It hurts.  I guess my vain collapsed cuz it didn't have enough fluids in it to keep it open.

I feel like I am where God wants to me to be. i mean for a while i didn't know if giving up swimming was what God wanted me to do but now I see that is exactly what he wanted me to do.  I have devoted a lot more of my time to intervarsity and my friends.  I am so happy to be leading a woman's small group and so far so good.  we are all really close and I try to be a good leader.  I've been getting closer and closer to these people here and I feel so much happier than i was last year.  i just need to stay focused on what really matters most to me. 

me and my mom have been doing pretty good.  We still talk probably every day but not as much.  She actually approves of my major surprisingly.  but we are getting along and talking a lot.  I call her up every now and then to ask her some stuff.  AND i think she likes Josh more :).  haha, yeah, for a while we wree convinced she disliked him, but they have been spending more time together playing games and what not and so i think she is liking him more.  And my dad already likes him, i mean come on, it's my dad.  Who doesn't he like.....Ohh, except hoskins...you still owe us $500 for the dent in the car (my dad won't let that die down. haha)

Me and Katie are doing good.  She is such a nice roommmate.  We just get along dandy...unless it's in the morning and she rolls out of bed 20 minutes before class starts.  thats kinda funny. haha. 

I get to go to great america on friday!  I'm so excited to see my family and a bunch of my friends that I haven't seen for like 2 years!!!  I couldn't be more excited!!!

The catcher for san fransisco got nailed right in the ...yea, use your imagination.  He was out for a few minutes.

Worship last night was AMAZING.  We had about 40 people in this little meditation chapel rocking out in music and prayer.  It was awesome.  i found out today that my friend Kelly who was suppose to help lead the women's bible study with me backed out today.  She has a lot of stuff on her mind and she needs a break from stuff right now. So it is now just me leading a women's small group and I have confidence in it that it will go good.  I know most of the people in there anyways so I'm excited.  I think I am going to start by doing a bible study on Philippians.  That was always a good book, so I might be asking some of you guys your opinion and interpretation on some stuff.  I hope I can do this.  Not only that but I am also in charge of prayer meetings every tuesday and thursday when we just get together between classes and pray for each other.  And I'm also leading worship next week.  I'm really nervous.  Hope it all goes good!!!

I can totally be myself and just relax and do some reading.  I'm pretty sore from tubing.  I strained my neck muscle from it.  The cousins are going out dancing tonight at this place on the lake.  I was going to go, but I decided to stay behind and play some cards with the grandparents.  I love being up here with everyone except they kinda drink a little way too much.  I'm the only one who is under 21 up here and it's hard watching everyone drink themselves stupid.  I've kinda been trying to stay away from them when they drink. Last time they did, I ended up in the lake in my pajamas with soap in my hair.  They can be so hilarious sometimes.  lol

It's 3 days until Josh and my 1 year anniversary.  Does it seem like it's been that long?  I'm still surprised he can put up with me for that long.  haha.  I was expecting him to leave after 2 weeks...you know, after he saw who I really was. haha.  But it's been a good year with him. :)

I'm going to church in the morning with my grandpa. It's been a long long time since I have gone to church up here.  Probably like 5 or 6 years.  I'm excited to go.  Hopefully I can get the rest of my family to wake up and get over their hangovers and come to church too.  I'll try.

I don't think thats going to be that much fun as I first thought.  25 cousins that are mostly all over 21 and all they think about is alcohol.  So...wish me luck with that.

I definitely haven't been feeling the greatest.  I must have ate something or did something cuz i broke out with a rash and have been a little sick.  I think I might have had some baby powder on my hands the other day (I'm allergic to that stuff).  If I wake up tomorrow and my body is red and rashy...that would be funny. haha.

You know what my biggest pet peve is...people who get hired to be a lifeguard and don't pay attention and put people's lives at risk.  You apply to be a lifeguard, so why don't you act like one.  So last night...swim meet...at SpringBrook Country Club...a little 6 year old starts to drown (yeah i know he's suppose to be a swimmer).  The lifeguard sits there and stares like he's not suppose to do anything.  I'm sitting there on the side ready to jump in with my clothes on.  Finally after about a minute the boy makes it to a lane rope and grabs hold of it.  He looked like he had fear in his eyes.  lol.  But, he just got out of the water and he was ok.  But seriously, I don't trust swimming at magic waters/anywhere else other than the belvidere park pool.  I guess magic water lifeguards fall asleep in their chairs and could care less if you start sinking.  Sheesh people...

"event","I have the rest of the day off :) thank you rain! hehe.  I haven't had a chance to hang with much of you guys lately. I work alot.  It stinks. but oh well.  

I was at the lake this past weekend.  Josh was with me.  It was fun.  We went tubing, I did some skiing and kneeboarding. My brother and myself went tubing together. Josh drove.  Yeah he will get it someday.  He killed us out there.  I am still sore from it.  haha.  Watch your back!

I was just seeing what everyone is up to.  If any of you guys aren't busy, give me a call. we can chill.  Have a good day

God Bless Ya'll

"event","So I'm sitting here tonight.  In my basement.  Ready to go to bed.  Doing some reading.  Doing some praying.  For some odd reason, I had this feeling. It was like this voice calling out, telling me 2 words. ""Youth Ministry"".  I don't know why those 2 words stuck out in my head, but they did.  I was reading a little bit tonight and it's been a week or 2 since I have picked the book up.  It just hit me.  I am at a fork in the road.  I feel led to go into the ministry.  But on the other hand, I feel I want to do something else with my life.  I think getting involved at First Baptist with the youth will help me with what I heard tonight, and I'm actually excited to start helping out.  I totally feel like God was listening to me tonight and I feel like he told me something.  Now the hard part...actually obeying Him...

I thought I would share what I was thinking tonight...

God Bless You All,
Jenna"

"event","It's been a while since I have updated...let alone, been on a computer.  I've been pretty busy between work and stuff.  

So I was home alone all weekend.  A few problems but not many.  1 - being a ""LEAK ALARM"" went off at 3 am and I freaked out cuz I didn't know what it was and because I didn't know what kind of leak it was.  But after calling my mom like 20 times I finally found out it was just a water leak and it was because of the humidity.  

The #2 problem was that Emily(next door neighbor and many of you guys know her), her house was broken into this weekend.  There was a lot of valuables taken including her computer and diamond rings and what not.  Kinda scary once I think about it because..well...I was home alone...windows opened....probably a door unlocked here or there.  When our house was broken into Emily's sister was home alone too.  Windows open.  Doors unlocked.  Kinda wierd once you think about it. lol.  But yeah, I haven't talked to emily about it yet but I guess her room was a mess and things were thrown around everywhere.  These robbers went through every room and closet and took what they could find and sell.  I hope her family is doing ok with it all.  I just saw her mom tonight and she didn't look very good.  Emily isn't home yet though. Still on vacation. Pray for her family.

One reminder to those who have not heard.  Bible Study-Thursday night-8p.m.-Shu's house.  Be there!  



Time for bed,
God bless,

"event","So it's been about a week since I have been home.  Wow have I been working like crazy.  I haven't seen too many of you, but we should try to get together more.  I'm home alone this weekend (which means no parties at my house cuz I live under Nazi control), but we should definitely get together.  I know Shu is having people get together at his house thursday night...Oh and by the way, if you are a girl, I think we should get together that night and spend the night at my house or something.  NO guys allowed of course. haha.  big loss there. Besides, my house is cooler than josh's.  hehe..and I have cuter dog. AND not ugly lion fish! lol


I start coaching next week for my swim team/diving team.  I'm also teaching water aerobics. that should be fun.  I will be a busy girl this summer.  I'm setting up my fish tank. So far i have the water and salt and a few shells in there.  No fish yet.  I wouldn't trust myself with fish yet anyways. haha.  

My dad is calling me.  GOtta go help him.  

God Bless

"event","I'm sitting in my room.  All of a sudden we hear something outside.  Like, a big bang or something.  Not long after that, me and heather can hear like 5 police cars, a few fire truck and an ambulance.  Someone was driving off campus and they were hit by a truck.  I don't believe the carthage student survived.  I know it was a student, but they aren't giving out any names yet.  The girl was going to turn left off of our campus and she was waiting till she could go.  A truck rear-ended another truck and it spinned out of control, hitting the girl and driving her car into a pole.  The whole campus is blocked off and you can't drive anywhere. It's really scary when you think about it. It was probably her last day of school and she was going home...scary...I dont know who it is yet...


I come home tomorrow.  I have a presentation to give in the morning and then my dad is coming up to get me.  I am going to have so much to unpack.  If you want to help, feel free to stop by. I'm suppose to set up my brother's piranha tank. yuck.  

It's kinda sad I'm going home.  Me and heather have been doing so well all week.  We've had so much fun this last week.  I'll miss her.  


Gotta go to work.  Please keep the girl in your prayers and her family.  
God Bless

Looking at pictures of once best friends, and remembering the adventures we had, and realizing we don't speak anymore always makes me a little sad. We had fun, didn't we?

Our situation makes me very sad.

I'm excited for Thanksgiving break. I'm dreading Thanksgiving break. 
I get to see good friends. I haven't found a job here yet.

Mike's birthday is on Sunday.
He's a goof. He's serious. He's perfect.
Not being 21 may pose a threat to New York plans.
Knowing he's around and there for me helps me be less stressed.

I'm so stressed.

I'm fine.

My mum's being really cool about last minute college stuff [like the fact I owe SMCC $1500 by 5:00pm tomorrow], she's not stressing out, which in turn, doesn't stress me out. I really need that right now.

I'm having a rough time dealing with some things. I have good/bad days. They usually start out alright but once the day goes on, I'm usually not in a good place. I don't know. My mind's conflicting with my heart, and it's just not fun. I try and keep busy the best I can.

I'm really looking forward to living in Portland, I don't think anyone really realizes how much I need this. I need to be in the city, surrounded by people and buildings and art and music and awwwwww, I need to be there now.

All and all, I'm doing alright.
Music is what's keeping my spirits up."

"event","Hello again.
It's been a while since I've used livejournal. I usually only use it when things have been bugging me, and up to this point things have been pretty good. But lately.

So I got into SMCC (not a very hard thing to do, I know) but I was still pleased, because that means I get away from the whole ""you live under my roof, you live by my rules"" deal. Seeing as I'm turning 19 soon, it's a little ridiculous that this still stands. My mum seems less thrilled. Understandable. Money money money. But lately I can stand her less and less. She's become insanely possessive and impractical. She tries to find ways of keeping me home when I want to go out. Nothing I do is ever good enough anymore, nitpicking everything. She's not even friendly towards me anymore. I'm starting to think that if this is the way it's going to be always, then it's not worth going. Most times after talking to her I just feel like crying. My mum means so much to me, and it's like she's turned into someone completely different. I'm hoping that once I get a job, things will cool down. I won't be able to live here the summer if they don't.
I also feel like I'm losing people. One person in particular (besides me mum). It makes me sadder than anything. We used to be so close. I'm sorry if I did something. I must have, because I'm getting these vibes like something fierce. I don't know what happened.
On a different note, there are people in my life right now that mean more to me than anything. I don't know what I'd do if I were without them. They are the ones that keep me sane. Time spent with them makes me happy beyond what anyone could understand. Especially right now.
The fun senior/graduation stuff needs to start soon. I'm so ready.

""I can't wait for you to move out.""
""Me either."""

Heidi comes home for about two weeks tomorrow, I'm very excited for that. Today she called about three times asking what CDs my sister and I wanted as Christmas gifts. She then called a fourth time after buying them, saying the guy who rang her up told her that she had great taste in music, and that he was very much my type. She promises to take me with her the next time she goes. Heh.

I'm anxious for friends to come home for the holidays. And I hope that I do get to hang out with most of them, at least once while they're home.

Lately, some things have been troubling me. I can't really talk about here, nor do I want to. It's just...I'm really not sure what to do anymore.

I hate that because I'm usually an upbeat and optimistic person, I can't be generally upset about something without someone thinking I'm PMSing. Geeeeeez.

I'm glad my dad gets in a really good mood around the holidays. It makes things a lot easier. I had Rilo Kiley playing the other day, and I caught him dancing to it. Yeah. It's that time of year. :)

This is more of a list than an entry.

Happy no school on Fridays in December."

Life's pretty good with the exception of some boring gaps...but I won't complain ;) I've been hanging out with some new people, who've turned out to be the thing I look forward to now. Trying to hang with them as much as one can before summer ends, which I try to not think about.  

Um...who's turning 18 in eleven days? I'll let you ponder that one. Mwhahaha!

So Wednesday should be fun. I'm pretty excited for that. Best friends, boys and randomness? HECK YES. [Boys, remember your water guns.]

"event","So The Fourth was pretty fun. I went there not expecting to spend the day with the people I did, but it was really nice seeing everyone again. I thought it might be awkward at first, but it wasn't, so that was lovely. A lot of walking and laughing. I met some new people, which was also nice. Exchanged smiles and waves with a pretty cool kid :D [I'm suuuuch a girl]. Watched the fireworks with a cool group of people, I must say. 

Once I got home I decided to go out and look at the stars. So as I was lying on the lawn, my headphones in place, just relaxing [and please don't think I'm crazy] I saw something. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I wasn't just staring off, but I saw something move in the sky. At first they looked like stars, because they weren't as bright as airplanes but two started to move...they were spaced out but moved together. They would go slowly, then stop, then move again. And they ended up moving up and over from where I was. They eventually faded out because I couldn't see them anymore. It was just weird. 

Anywho, summer's been treating me pretty well. :D"

"event","oh boy. the past few days have been a blast, much needed. wednesday i went to cell group at torri's house with anna, angelika and a bunch of other people i don't know very well. the best part was coming home. we were blasting mute math while anna and i screamed the words. i love doing that, especially at night.

thursday i went with sarrah to get my hair cut. the lady i had was really nice, she kept asking me questions about school. at some point we got on the topic of the edge; who she had when she was at EL. of course being at a hair salon we talked about the edge's mullet, oh my. i got all the icky ends cut off and my bangs cut shorter too. i'm pleased with it. once our hair was all pretty we were dropped off at dairy queen so we could get ice cream on such a nice day. as we were about to walk in, we ran into straw and rachael, said hi, then were on our way. we got our yummy ice cream and walked out the doors and into the parking lot where we see alex and nate ride up on their bikes. what makes it funny is the fact that nate was all decked out in his biking gear. we keep walking then we hear nate go ""look who it is! it's alex's ex girlfriend!"" but for some reason it was funny and not awkward, i had to laugh. nate's a funny kid. then aaron comes riding up behind them, so of course sarrah's all happy now. we talked with them for a bit and then were on our way back to my house. my sister had a friend over so sarrah and i walked to subway to get them food (also so sarrah could check for the boys). once we dropped the food off, we decided to walk around until it got dark, so we walked to AMS and hung out there for some time. we walked back home, only to just go out again and walk Back to dairy queen where we saw dustin; he gave sarrah free water. we rented love actually <3 and sarrah went home at about 11:00.

today i went to see the ring 2 with jesse, lindsey, ben, joe and ben's friend. it was an all around good time. i needed to sit next to someone who talks during movies, but they all said they didn't. pfft. i spent the whole time calling the movie with ben. at one time i got annoyed with the movie because the woman was walking down the stairs so slowly, so i yelled at her...hehe. fun group of people, must do it again sometime, eh?

I know I'm probably too chicken to do anything drastic, mostly out of fear that I will look even more like my younger sister, if it's cut short. If anyone has suggestions or ideas post them please! And if you have a picture or link to post, that would be great too. Thanks!

Friday should be fun too. I'm going to see The Ring 2 with a load of people, some I don't even know, but eh, I'm open to new things. Sarah, I'm sorry you can't make it :( but I'll make sure not to give anything away. If I'm able to, I'll see it again with you, okay? Okay. Good. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT! Pfft.

tomorrow is class color day, oh the excitement! drag day was practically one of the best things. ever. awwwwww man. hockey players in short skirts...nothing beats it. in the middle of sociology mr. B actually had to ask one of them to close their legs. poor boys, no knowledge on how to wear skirts. it showed, literally. some of them had better legs than most girls. who knew? yesterday sarrah and i were walking behind a small boy wearing a skirt. i tried my best not to laugh, but i just couldn't help it. i felt really bad after, but luckily he understood.

today wasn't that great. i can't wait for summer to come, today made it hard to look out and see snow on the ground. i'm not in the best mood, i hate feeling like this, i really do. i know it will pass. i think a big part of it had to do with the weather. oh well.

sometimes (ok, who are we kidding, most of the time) i have no idea how my sister comes to the conclusions she does. tonight i was trying to explain to her a book i wanted, and me being...well me, i said ""like"" and ""so"" a lot during this conversation. then my sister goes ""i can't believe how shallow you are!"" and when i asked her what she was talking about she met me with ""the way you talk"" ok? can someone please explain how me talking like a valley girl at home somehow equals being shallow. i just don't get sister, and maybe that's a good thing. i mean come on...do i want to know? i think not.

buh-bye"

"event","""Hold me closer tiny dancer 
Count the headlights on the highway 
Lay me down in sheets of linen 
you had a busy day today""

why yes, i did have a busy day today. it was so fun! today anna, laina, angelika, dandle, torri and myself went to portland to shop in old port. we also went and saw napoleon dynamite...easeally one of the funniest movies ever! ""tina, have some ham...eat the food tina!"" so so so funny! ahh...i love it :). we also went to this vintage/thrift store while we were there. we tried on a bunch of really cool hats and i tried on an extremely 80s prom dress. the only problem with the dress was that i was a bit small and pink...pink is surely not my color. it was good for a laugh tho. we got lunch at the portland public market, torri and i split a burrito. i got some ice cream too. mmmmm. when we were on the roof to get to the parking garage, the security guy yelled at us. at first i thought he was just kidding around but then after found out he was serious, it was pretty scary. so yeah...we did this and that but nothing else too exciting.

oh, i also got my hair cut...i really like it :D 

tata!"

"event","mmmm...yeah, 
today i was dragged to to craft fair with my family. (oh what fun!) it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, but none the less it was a tish bit boring. i ran into torri a few times, which lifted my spirits. she had just discovered the sample tent and was like ""that tent is my hero"". mine too torri, mine too :) if there is anything better then shopping it has to be eating...and i'm going to eat whatever i want while i'm young and the metabolism is high. i bought a picture...of a sink, it's just plain awesome. i also got a pair of earrings. ok now let me tell you something about these earrings: they had all kinds of single earrings which were of people and you could choose which two you wanted...to make a couple. so i got one that's a hairy fat guy, and the other is amish. it rocks! i have decided that they are gay lovers ;). on the way home my sister and i insisted on beating each other over the head with newspaper...it was pretty fun. i got her in the eye, w00t! 5 points! so that's my day thus far...
mmmk, bye."

"event","ok...so here's what went down. last night something happened that i found extremely hilarious. probably because it was like at one in the morning and i was sleepy, but oh well...here it goes

NOTE: everyone involved with this was at no time serious...we were all just being silly. lol.

ME: so it was jeremy in 1983...
JO-JO: shut up
ME: in his ocean pacific tee...who got a bloody knee, on his skate bored in the half pipe, in the back yard that tuesday night...
JO-JO: *sticks food she had been chewing in my face*
ME: stop!!!
JO-JO: *starts poking me*
ME: stop! dad!
DAD: do i need to come in there and kick some ass?
ME: yes! jo-jo's!
*dad walks in*
DAD: what's going on?
JO-JO: i didn't do anything!
DAD: yeah...
ME: she stuck food in my face and she won't leave me alone.
JO-JO: what? i didn't do anything!
ME: unplugs toaster, and uses knives to get toaster strudel out* (it was way down in there)
DAD: don't do that! you'll get electrocuted!
ME: it's unplugged *points*
JO-JO: i could have gotten it!
ME: are you kidding me? i don't want your grubby little hands touching my food.
JO-JO: *touches my arm*
ME: ahhhh...confusing touch!
JO-JO: *choking on juice, comes out nose, can't stop laughing*
ME: haha...ooooh, i'm good :D *walks in other room*

i don't know if anyone will find it as funny as my family did...but i don't care, it was great!"

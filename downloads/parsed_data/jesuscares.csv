"event","hey guys!!!

Havnt written or read in a while!!! Just been lat out busy, as some of you might no i got my Ps so i have rarely been seen out of my car!!! LOL! God i love the freedom of just driving around anywhere i want. Dan asked me if i ever just get sick of driving ppl arund and all that jazz... well no. Its like kind of soothing for me and just is like my therapy, an escape from being stuck in a place i hate, wherever it may be at the time... home, skool... wherever. So yeah.

BUT... my car is in the panel beaters right now and is going to be for like another week and a half... Argghhhh! What am i going to do??? I hate relying on ppl t take me out the places i want to go. Id rather just drive myself, but i cant anymore. I swear im going to die... and it the holidays. I wish i had never had had that smash in the first place, it was stupid and well.... just ucking stupid i guess. It just about perfectly reflects back on me... so i know the ppl who know the story are laughing at me behind my back... yeh yeh yeh. but you can have your laugh, i would! But yeah, so im a prisoner almost. cant just drive out to see Josh, or pick up Ali and Jedd and the gang. Its fuckd cos to tell you the tuth i rekon it will effect mine and jeddas closeness and my reconnection with some ppl i drive around. Im alredy been replaced by Daniel. Jeddas been driving around with him for the last 2 days, and probably tonight too. Grrrr. I hate my status sometimes!

Well, im actually 18 now too. God i dont feel that old in a way, but then in another i do. I was ment to go out city clubbing on Sunday, the day of my birthday, but then it didnt happen cos Aaron lost his money, then Tahnee and Sarah dogged me and everyne ended up bailing out. It was fucked up and i thought it completely fucked up my bday. I went to bed and like 10.00 crying, after an ok day with my aunty Kim, Uncle Frank, Aunty Cathy, Uncle John and my cousins coming over, which was a surprise! But yeh, Josh didnt ring to say HAppy bday and i truely felt like shit, and even worse concidering it was suposed to be my 18th, not exactly a day i thought i should be bawling my eyes out on.

I have not been that depressed in so long, since shit with Stacey when he started trying to ring me again i think. I wasnt even drunk, i felt like making myself throw up, then i thought how i promised Josh i wouldnt ever do it again from when Daniel found me trying to do it at Cortys, but that made me want to do it even more just in spite of him. I swear it was the only time i would have actually cut, as much as i think it is stupid. if that scalpul was still in my room, it would have blood on it now, but thank god it didnt. I hated everyone, Josh, everyone. Tahnee for fucking dogging me, i swore i would never rely on her again. Soryy but you only care about Daniel and noone else sometimes. Yeah... some family dinner you had to go to instead of going out to the city for my 18th.

When Jedda is sad or depressed, she always sends me lyrics of songs that express how she feels to me, so i wrote her some lyrics trying to say how i was feeling then...

CAtch you breath. Hit the wall. Scream out loud as you start to crawl back in the cage, the only place where they will leave you alone cos the weak seek the weaker untill they have broken them. Defence, they tore it down. Locked inside the only place where you felt safe. I lostmyself in my search to find something. Refuse to feel anything at all. Refuse toslip, refuse to fall, cant be weak, cant stand still. You watch your back cos nooone will. Taded your worth for these scars. Dont believe anthing they tell you because its all lies.

Then Jedda rang told me to go out thw front of my house. I seriously wasnt going to. I felt like shit, my eyes all puffy from crying for so long and so hard. I got outside and collapsed in the gutter. I felt so weak and small. I hated evrything for reducing me to feel like this again. I hate it and im sick off feeling like i dont matter.

God bless jedda and Daniel and i guess Tahnee and Sarah in the end, for rescuing me! We ended up back in my room with Breast milk and a marble cake... yummy... lol!!! oh and te fire allarm going off from extreme amounts of sparklers we lite!!!! LOL!!! It was extreme. My room ended up covered in extreme amounts of party poppers streamers and smoke!!! Lol! And the streamers are still drapped all over my fan guys!!! Then we decorated the cake a little bit. Noone was actualyl going to eat it, especially after dead sparklers and empty party poppers were stuck everywhere!!!

Lol!! Then we hit the street looking for somewhere to drop the cake off... Mallorys house!!! LOL!!! we did actually Annoy the shit out of mallory... Sorry Maz, you are such good entertainment thought. God love you cos i do!!! But then the cake got taken back... tried the windsor brothel... but it was closed cos it was 2 in the morning. I think we ended up leaving it on Camels step!!! LOL!!! Oh well it was a fun night in the end and i guess we will hit the city another time!!

Anyway. I would just like to say god bless Ali!! We have become good friends again like we used to be once upon a time. Yeah, but it is crap about my car cos now we cant put my system in till my car comes back!!!

Oh and my party is only A couple of days away now!!!Im so excited, we will all be getting trashed! I think heps of ppl are coming, im pretty sure they are!!! But yeah, I hope to see you all there dressed up in your best outfits and everything, ready to get trashed!!!  I still dnt even know what im going to wear. I wa going to go to Smik and see if there was anything there but now i have like no money! Ill c if i can get some for tomorrow... oh and shit, ill have to walk there cos i dont even have my fucking car... grrrrr it so fuckd! I keep fogetting, am going to go insane cos the whole hols i wnt have it, so no more road trip up to bathurst or yellow to get Tim and Mitch. God i hope they can still come down for my party.

Oh yeah, i did get my libret pierced from Josh for my birthday, Its pretty kool. Everyone says that it suits me, so thats good because i was really unsure. But yeah, it kool. My mum was really freaked about it and Lis didnt like it, but it better then getting a tat cos its not so permanent!! Well, i think ill still get  tat... i just dont want to get one for the sake of it. Im not going to untill i know exactly what i want and it has some meaning.

Im ment to be going out to see Josh this afternoon. I was ment to yesterday but my car went in so couldnt. i asked everyone if i could borrow their car, but yeah, nooone could or would, so its all good. Ill get out there somehow eventually so yeah. I do miss you Josh!

Oh yeah, Beau, I do hope you come to my party. Im not sure if you got my msg, but you are invited and i hope to see you there all sart and cute like you always are anyway!!! It was good to see you and David the other day in Penrith. I havnt seen David in age. hes so different But then hes not!! I remeber all the random city days!

Oh nd Bathurst is coming back from there for my party soon!!! Yay! Honey cant wait to see you back down here!!

Anyway, I think iv written too much so im gong to go. Im pretty much out anyway!!

"event","It was the gay and lesbian Mardi Gra on Saturday night!!! It was actually so so fun! Im not really sure why it was because it could have been alot better but anyway...

Thanx for everyone who was there with us that made my night so good.... Corty (I love you baby!), Tahnee (U r so fun girl!), Jedda (I cant stop loving u!!), Luke (how extreme), Dawn (it was good to catch up!!), Tim (i cant believe u played for Sarah Brightman!), Mitch(I love you boy, ur so gorgess and im so glad i met you!!), Alex (ur just extreme), oh and i have to say THANKYOU to Benny (e boy), thanx for your help in the night!!! LOL! 

Anyway, to explain, i went to Dawns house to get ready for the Mardi Gra! We actually went shopping to get a few bits and pieces, i had some money cos Man Ail gave me 50. I bought fake eyelashes and nails!!! Then we rushed getting ready... I wore suspenders and stockings (thanks Dawn), Mazs stilletos, Dawns bra and black pin stripped jacket. I did look very sexy with extreme makeup on!!! I loved it!!! Boobs showing a little bit but thats ok guys!!

Then we got dropped off at Cortys and Jedda and Tahnee were there!!! And i met Tim and Mitch (Ahh Mick!!!). God i fell in love with those boys and we hit it off straight away!!! Tim is gay and Mitch Bi, so im told. Well what can i say i love the both of them and me n corty ended up wanting a lil more of Mitch by the end of the night!!!

So we caught the rail bus to Blacktown and met up with Sarah Fairwether!! I love that girl, ho extreme she is i have missed going out with her! Then got the train into the city and pretty much got lost as soon as we got there!

But the night was all good. Luke saw cher!!! Im jealous! There were so many cross dressers!!! They reallyu are extreme! U gotta love them!!

And the amount of gay ppl walking around, that was a sight!!! LOL! Not a bad one though, kinda sweet!

We met up with this guy Benny, thats when we met Alex aswell. He could get us e cos me n sarah were going to take some, but then were having doubts about it... them he had all these frienbds and said we could get into a party, but it ended up being a club and we wouldnt have gotten in, so we decided to just go home to cortys cos the others were leaving anyway!!

So me n corty bought a pill and he bit half and i had the other... It was my first time ever!!! And i am goig to try it again 4 sure!!! 

It was awesome!!! I couldnt stop moving. Im so glad i remembered about eating gum with it and made corty eat some cos otherwise we would have fucked up, chewed in mouths right now!!! LOL! Its the maddest feeling though,like so high and happy. Everything just seemed to float around you and you cant stop mooving around!!! we were talking so fast about shit! It was so fun and everything went so fast!!!

God bless you Mitch. He sat next to me on the bus home and we were talking the whole time!!! He loves me and thinks im so funny!!! Its good cos i love him to cos hes funny!!! But god did i want to just kiss him that night, but i thought i better not!

My pupils were giant that night and i couldnt go to sleep cos i didnt feel tired, but i did eventually cos everyone else was going to sleep and i thought i better!!!

God i think im addicted already cos i cant wait to do e again! We were going to do it at my 18th, but now that i think about it, ill b drinking anod i wouldnt want to mix the 2 together, esp not cos i only done it once b4 2.

Oh well, all 4 now cos im at skool

love you all, thanx 4 such a great weekend!!!

"event","I dont understad the whole thing of Valentines day... well i do. Its just kinda annoying because when you have noone, like no boyfriend or noone special to send you anything, you feel so sad and left out. It can be like the most lonliest night of the year for you. And its even worse because you see all couples walking around the streets being all lovey dovey and having romantic dinners together and have to hear ab out all the girl gloating about how many roses they got or how many ppl sent them things, even worse. Then theres the ppl who say that its all a waste off money and a way 4 companies like florists and cadbury to make money (sorry Maz, but this is you). Then the stupid ppl who actually send themselves presents and roses so that other ppl think that they are popular or loved... these are the truely sad ppl ( I dont know any of them, but we have all seen something like that on a movie or tv!!) But this is my theory on these things. When you actually have someone who loves you and buys you roses on Valentines day, do you hear them talking about it all being a scam. Im sorry, Im not trying to be a bitch, I dont want anymore bitchy comments about wat i write here, like the 1s ppl like to write, but its just the feeling of being left out and feeling lonely. Like noone loves you.

Well, thats how i felt last night! Im so glad that i did work because i didnt even really have to think about it much, or worry about being at home by myself and feeling sad and alone! No actually it was so much fun at work last night. Tim Hands (Tim Hands) was on and after i gave up on trying to do everything so we could get out on time, we just bludged sooooo much!!! Its was sooo fun and we didnt get out till like 1130 when we were sposed 2 at 1030!!! Hehe! Oh well, i need the money anyway!!! I got free movie tickets tought, which was kool. I thought, it would be mad to take someone out to the movies and it being free. Then i thought, i better take Ben though, because when he won free tickets from work, he took me....

The night was so strange. We were 2 late 2 c any movies that i wanted to see, and we didnt know what anything was about or what we wanted to see. Sponge bob was only on in the day. Anyway, so why we were waitning he ended p paying for us to go do minture golf. I dint really want to do it. I was startin gto get that weird and uncomfortably vibe. Like a couple vibe and it was relly making me uncofortable. I think i really should back off heaps so that he doesnt get the wrong idea about us, again.

It just feels so wrong because right now i really realy like Matt angain.  think im going to have to do something about it soon, before Ka does and just because otherwise ill regret  not doing anything. I dont know what it is. He's so cute and it makes me feel so good being around him. Im just waiting for the chance to make my move and im scared of what his reaction will b 2....

Can i just ask... if any1 has any ideas for my 18th bday party, i would really LOVE  to hear about them. Im really lost about if i should have it here, at my house, or find someone elses hous r to have it at, like the place where Ben had his... or any ideas??? Fancy dress??? I dont know. I just dont want it to be ruined by stupid ppl who could rock up and start foghts or anything.

Anyway, im out of things to sy right now...

Love you all, like strawberries and cream!!

"event","OMg i cant believe my weekend. It has been so hecktic and strange. 

No 1 strange happening... I got with Ben on Friday night. I feel so weird about it now, but its strange because i dont fully regret it. I think it might have just been a thing of the time and it was ok when it lasted but the afetr effect was not so good. Lik ewaking up with a hang over, i guess. I do regret it now, in the fact that now he thinks that we are going out... well he thought that at Emmas party. I thought that i could try and make it so that it wasnt weird and make it mayb work, but then when we were in the pool at Emmas, with him trying to put his arms around my waist, it just felt wrong. Im not even going to try and pretend that it can work, because i just feel wrong about that. Its like playing wiht his emotions, its such a dog thing to do. Esp to someone i love so much. See i love him so much but only as a friend. Like i dont see anymorein it then that. Im sorry Ben. Im not trying to play around wiht you.

No 2 strange thing that happened... Mallory and me in the shower on Friday night, drunk as hell. Usually im like so self concious about all that and i havent been naked with anyone but the ppl i have gone out weith... Im so confusssed at how we got there in the first place, but anyway. Its all good. Just strange...

No 3 starnge thing that happened, the FUCKING HIKKIES ALL OVER MY BACK... O thanx MALLORY!!!!

Hmm anyway... im out... Man Ail is whingingabout needing to go 2 sleep"

"event","I guess ai betterstart off by first saying sorry to the ppl who deserve and should get 1. 

I know that my last journal pset Jedda... a lot. I dont know, i dont think that it hurt anyone else... so heres my apoogy to you...

I am sorry about the fights we had, they really were stupid and i know that they were really my fault. Im not quite sure why it happened... actually i do. It had something to do with just a whole heap of shit that was going on and i couldnt handle my life or myself anymore. I know it was not nice to take it out on you... trust me i took it out on my family too... but it was also shit that had happened with things that have happened in the past revolving aroud you. So I really am sorry about everything and i hope that we can forgive and... well i know we cant forget, so just forgive and move on. Im not sure if you have fully forgiven me about it. I kow we talked about it the other night but i was a little confused when we were at skool and it was hard to look at you, it might have been that you felt the same. It was like we never actually made up fully, and i guess we havnt. Then i read your journal just b4 and i kind of think i understand. You think that im one of those self-centred and/or backstabbing friends, i guess who you are ditching. If thats the way you feel about me then i guess theres not much i can do about it. So anyway, I am sorry.

Anyway... alot of shit has hapened in the last... oh, mayb couple of weeks, but now things are starting to come back together again. Maz n me have made up again, and im so thanking god for that because i realised how much i do love her and need her as a friend through our fight and period of not talking together. Craig also ame over the other day... and started explaining himself and what happened and what has been happening since our fight. It was the worst fighht we have ever had, EVER (he did almost punch me... but anyway) I guess that was his way of trying to appologise, I think, but it wasnt quite one. I think Ben arriving at my house rwally didnt help.

Its a strange thing... me and BEn. Everyone keeps saying that we should go out together, but i dont think that i like him like thAT. LIke Im not attracted to him like that, not like i like some other guys right now. Like sure i could see us being together but i cant imagine what it wuld feel like. It would be awkward and dissatisfying kind of thing, if you know what i mean. Its reall kind of pressuring when everyone keeps pushing and saying that we should hook up  and /or go out... I dont want to. And if i ever did it would be in ages, not anytime soon.

Daniel I still miss you heaps. I realised that you are still a good friend of mine, but i think the thing about you is that i miss the way we used to be alot more. Thats why i was so jealous and upset about us and thinking that you were not my friend the other night, Iv come to realise that i guess im just jealous of ppl, of everyone, who ou choose to tell stuff to and be close to ad hang around because ages ago it just used to be me and you and Elizabeth sometimes too. I guess it is my fault that i neglected you in the first place and chose a temporary boyfriend over a close friend that i had had and would have had for a lifetime.

Joshie... I love you as always!!! You are the funniest boy and you make my life so exciting! I cant help but feel happy whenever i am round you, except when you seem angry at me!!! LOL! Please dont flog me!! You cant not love that boy! Even when he does act gay and scared everyone but hugging other boys!!! Remember im the only girl you will marry!!! Love you Josh Mary May Magdaline!!! You are the bestest friend that i could ever ask 4!!

Kat... dont leave skool. I know that we will loose contact if you do. You wil move on to someone else so quickly, i dont stand a chance!!! YOu are gorgious and i get so jealous of you. You get every guy you want!!! I know that ppl say that you are easy and some even that you are a skank, but what ever they say and whatever i have said about you in the past, i hope you know that i love you truely and am so jealous of everything you have!!! Love you n Alyssa 2 xoxox

I made a new friend the other day 2. Undies, this 1s for you, i know you prob wont read this, but neither will most of the other ppl. You are so funny its funny!!! LOL!! Im so glad that we are getting to know each other and bond as friends so well. I hope i dont stuff up our friendship by trying to kiss you or anything, but who could help it anyway when you are such a gentleman and so adorable!!! Hehe! You might not be the hottest boy i have come accross but you sure are ne of the nicest and one of the most entertaining.

One for Natalie, the fucking bitch at my work. There are so many ppl who hate her at my work, its so funny because she ate soggy nuggets that were practically out of the bin and nooone said anything about it!!! HAHAHA suck shit bitch!!! What did i tell you???? Ha, its funny because i told her that things would happen that would make her not wNT to work at KFC anymore!!! I hope she gets food poisoning!!! Its such i pity that the fight between her and Jess is probably not going to happen anymore. It would have been so good!!! I would so jump in for i unch or two her way if it did happen. Hell I would love to have a crack at her someday!!! Or ill just make her cry at work again like i did the other night!!! Hahahaha. Thats what you get for messing with me bitch!!!!

Fuck I would just like to report that i feel really good right now!!! Im going to Mallorys house in a little while because theres a kind of gathering or not really party there, which hopefully will be realy good!!! I hope Kevin and Neville show up, just so we can go knoming!!! How fun!!! Then theres Emmas party tomorrow!!!

Just want to say that i love you all, esp you JeddA i hope we can sort things fully out...

I wouldnt be surprised, like anyone gives a flying fuck about me. My life right now.... ABSOLUTELY FUCKING GREAT. So thanks to everyone who has helped to make it like so (please not the extreme sarcasm when i say this)

Jedda... Thanx for destroying everything i might have has going for me... oh AGAIN. You just cant help it can you??? You have a way of destructing everything good everyone has. You feel the need to bring down everyone who tries to get close to you. Like Your fights with Corty and everything you say that cuts him so deep. You know that everything cuts so deep the room smells like blood and death, but you seem to take joy in this. Does it make you feel good about yourself, bringing other people down???

Mallory... I dont know what to say, if you want to believe Jedda, after all the shit she has dragged you through, then be my guest. Fucking be my guest. What more can happen to make my life crappier???

So I guess i know what ill be doing tonight... ill end up sitting in my room feeling empty and small.. like the other night, and the night before that, cry myself to the point where the only thing i can do to stop myself trying to kill myself is forcing to lie down and eventually cry myself to sleep.

"event","Today was the third day back to skool, as you all would know. Did anyone notice that i was there for most of the end or that i left after the first period and assembly. I HATE skool. I wish we didnt have to go. I wish i could have done the fucking HSC last time. I dont know if you think im exaggerating or what but i hate kool for sure after today. I wish i caould just leave.

Ail doesnt understand what im going through in my life. I feel like crying half the time and i just wish i had someone that i trust and that im close to that i could just break down and cry to. I dont have anyone though. I thought that mayb me and Daniel could be getting really close like we were once upon a time because of our chat at cortys house in the hols after the whole Stacy thing, him ringing me up... after everything that he did to me. But i guess not. He apparently and obviously has an obssession with Taryn... and why wouldnt you.

I felt so empty in Drama the other day. Sitting alone  in the drama room, when everyone else has someone close they love sitting and working with. I hate it when Cutler says we have to make pair or groups to do stuff in class because im always the last person, i just feel like noone wants me in their group. I hate DRama now. The only thing i like bout it is the monologues becasue i dont have to worry bout being with ppl or making up something that they dont like or will bitch about. I hate doing the group work because i have no confidence anymore, so i cant come up with shit. I hate music now because i dont know what to do and once again the onlt thing i can do is practice singing by myself.

I didnt think i wouls actually be serious when i said this but i really do hate skool.I wish i could leave.

Noone, noone of you actually give a shit about me. Its so fucked p because i care so much about everyone and noone gives a shit about me. Dont you understand how hard this is??? When people say they care but clearly just dont. You say it because you want me to feel good at the time, but its so superfishal. Im sick of being told bullshit.

IM really not sure whether to look forward to this stuid drama xcursion on Saturday. I wanted to go to MAzs n get drunk maybe hook up with a random guy Kat brings and forget the crap and my shitty life.

Skool is fucked up and i wish I could leave it and this fucked up life and world of mine."

Right now im looking at this kool Dahatsue Charade which is nice. Ill do it up a little bit though... ill have to because its looking pretty boring right now.

"event","tHe ohter night, when i first wrote a journal here, I have to write about the rest of the noght because it ended up being soooo good.

I guess i should start from basically the beginning. THers this girl at my work who started a couple of months ago... SHe thinks she is king shit and she bosses everyone around like she is the manager. Pretty much everyone hates her because she is a bitch and because even though ppl like me have been working for litterally 10 times longer then she has, she still feels the need to boss us around and tell us how to do our jobs. ONe of my friends from my work, Stacey came over after she finnished work. HEr and NAtalie are suposed to be friends but Nat is the biggest bitch to her and Stacey is always telling me the things that Nat does... and it pisses me off like nothing else because i dont see how she can say shes STaceys friend when shes the biggest bitch to her. Nothing she does is what i would say a good frined does.

SO any way, Stacey comes to my house and complains about how NAtalie wouldnt let her have any CHicken to take home because she took every last piece of it. IF you read my first journal, you would know how pissed off and upset i alredy was, so when Stac told me bout NAt I was not not goind to do something about it... SO i got her number off STac and i rang the bitch!!!!

NO joke i was on the phone to her for like half an hour and man, did she cop it!!! I went off at her something major. LIke about how noone likes her at work and shit and told her that if she keeps being a bitch then she wont like working there because everyone will make her life hell!!! YOU should have been there!!! It was so good!! Staey and everyone else were laughing so hard, and i was trying to be serious but i couldnt help laughing when it got too much. Stcaey was on the floor!!! OMG! IT was soooo good and i felt sooo good atfer that conversation!!! I got everything out that i have wanted to say for ages to her, and also got out all the shit i was feeling too!!!

I was kinda scared going to work last night cos i thought, i wouldnt be surprised if she went and told Terry, our head manager and i would get told off... or worse, terminated.... but i got to work and TIm was on and instead i got hi-fives and congrates!!!! LOL!!! Im a legend at work right now!! EVeryone who was working were laughing about it with me!!! IT was funny because NAtalie was there too... just finnishing her day shift!!! SHe would even look at me and she had the sourest look on her face when i walked into work!!! HUH!!! HOw funny! THe bitch deserved it though. Everyone who works at KFC would understand. Id like to see the bitch tell me to take all my earings out and tell me how to do my job now!!! HA!"

"event","Ok, this is my first ever journal online... i didnt think that i would ever get one because to be honest i thought it would be crazy to write stuff online that anyone could just read. But after everything tonight i had the hugest urge to get on here and write. I know that everyone can come on and read this but im over it and i think thats the thing that is actually attracting me to this online journal stuff right now. Maybe then ppl will actually read about how i feel and everything because noone seems to care about me. Its always me who is listening to everyone elses problems and although i really dont mind at all listening and helping, you just get so very sick of doing it all the time when ppl only want to talk about them. Every time i try talk about stuff they always fli it round so the topic is back on them again. Its almost like being selfcentred but not that severe.

I just dont get anyone really anymore. Is it just me or has everyone changed????

I have Josh May, Mallory and Ben over my house right now. We were just chilling and it was kool. Then Jedda randomly came upstairs and asked me if she could use my phone. Later i found out that Her mum took hers and they had a huge fight and she got kicked out. Its great when she just comes over and wont tell me anything at all. The only reason why she told me that is i guess i pushed it out of her.I just dont get Jedda anymore. Im sorry honey (If your reading this) But i dont understand you anymore, but your not the only one. YOu dont tell me anythng anymore, so i dont know what to believe. Im not trying to be a bitch, this is in a sad tone but, i dont know what to believe with half the stuff you go on about. It just confuses the shit out of me. THe shit other ppl say doesnt really help either, I guess.

Actually if you aked me t tell you exactly how i feel, i would say used. LIke Im not sure why ppl are coming over other then the fact that to use my resources nd what i have. Like Jedda coming over so she can use my phone, random ppl i dont even like from my skool came over to my house when i asked Tim Franco to come over with 3 of his mates. I really am not sure whether i want to get Ps now because I know that  ppl will just be ringing me up and once again using me... for my car this time. Fucking hell!!!!

MAllory, as much as i do love you, i hate the way we are such good friends and all but you never seem to care enough to listen to me or anything i really have to say. you always seem to have something better to say about your problems with all the boys you want and all the ones in your life. It drives me crazy and makes me feel so alone.

Hollie i fucking wish that i could still hate you, but i cant. I cant believe that i was the only who ended up ringing you and getting our friendship (can you call it that yet???)instead of how it should have been... you appoloising to me. Im not sure whether i belive her about not remembering about it all because of that accident. Once again not mening to be mean, but you never know. You could so pretend that you dont remember shit when you just regret it.

Oh, i hope my life gets better then its going now. Im tired of this shit, I thought that it was all going good for a change and that i got my life back together after everything that happened with Stacy, but i guess not..."

I lost my Virginity 1-29-05 with my Lovely Baylee and it was great! I've made love to my baby 5 times since then and that was less than a month ago. but it's not all about sex. She's amazing. She's cute, funny, witty, smart, adorable, and she's a dancer! So she's really flexible! I LOVE IT! I LOVE HER! Man, it's been a while. I'm just so happy that I'm in love and over Catherine who is always pissy and rude and mean to me. Deca League is my crew now and I love those guys. They got my back.

"event","Yeah, so I like a lot of people right now but so far my #1 is this really amazing girl Alexis. She's so sweet but she has a B/F. I have to wait for her. Then there is Brittney, she's this girl that's really cute and she has this really great attitude that is like ""I don't give a fuck."" That's sooo cool!!! She's really gonna be hard to get because she's a friend of my ex. Not a really good friend it's just awkward being around them both. But I don't mind because my ex obviously doesn't care about anything between us. So, I'm like so stressed out because Alexis has a b/f and I liked her before me and my ex g/f and I went out, but then I stopped and then it picked up after I found out my ex liked someone else right before we broke up. Actually it was before we went out. So now I like Alexis again but she's happy and I respect her too much to try anything but I'm so waiting for her to break up with her b/f. All I'm hoping is she's not heart broken when it happens because she's majorly sweet. But I'm never going to give up another opportunity with her again. So anyways I'm gonna go surf the web so I'll write in you later."

"event","So I thought I had it pretty bad right, Then I found out my friend had it even worse. Life is so full of fucking surprises. If you think you have it worse than someone else...you don't. The Grass is Greener on the Other Side is what everyone says.....It's bull shit and they know it. Of course people are gonna have it better than you, but people also have it a lot worse. People get on my fucking nerves talking about how they understand life and love at such a young age that it's scary...fuck you...you don't know shit!!!! God!!! Some people may understand love because they feel it. But no one is in any position to give other people advice on it. Cause if you think you are than obviously you don't know shit. I'm in love with a girl that I broke up with. I broke up with her because she was telling her friends that she still had a crush on this one guy a lot before we went out and now. She clams to love me too. She said it's nothing serious with this guy. I loved her enough to let her go....she came back. But I honestly don't want to deal with the fact that he never liked her in anyway but a friend and she realized that I'm all she's ever had...I stuck with her through thick and thin for five and a half months and she gave it all up for a crush. She probably did love me but who am I kidding she got bored of our relationship. Just because we hadn't seen each other for a while because it's summer. Which by the way wasn't even my fault because she kept going out of town to California and New york but mainly Cali. She was gone for most of summer and she has cheerleading. And every time I saw her she would pull away from my kisses. And then complain how I don't hold her or kiss her enough......But now she says she realized what she lost....What do I do? Anyone?"

"event","I like this one girl soooooooo much! I just found out from her friend that she likes me a lot, too! I mean....right after I left her from school to catch the bus, she told her friend that she likes me a lot. But, the down fall, she does't know if she wants to go out with me. I'm really not worried about that because I want to take it slow anyways. I like her so much, and I think she's just so cute. She's perfect....she loves football, cars, she's a cheerleader, she's funny, and she's a cute freshmen. But I don't care that she is a freshmen because she's special to me."

She said that GS is way better off without A. Yeah, she's right. So then she told me A's mom called her yesterday but her little sister picked up. Now GE thinks it's to talk about A. Oh the fuck well, why is A looking on this site anyways? To find shit about her on here that's really true. Hey, she knows that GS is better off without her and her without him, all they ever did was fight. She was always complaining about how annoying he was and never followed the rules and always cursed. You know what hun? Fuck cunt ass bitch pussy ball fucking faggot! That enough for you? Huh, is it, Huh?"

I just came on to say I feel a little better.

Eminem, white america

I never woulda neva dreamed in a million years id see
so many mutha fucken people who feel like me
Who share the same views
And the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed in no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio waves
It plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
who woulda thought standin in this mirror
Bleachin my hair wit some Peroxide
Reachin for a T shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the fore-front of rap like this
How could I predict my words
And have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz congress keeps tellin me
I ain't causin nuttin but problems
And now they sayin im in trouble wit the government
I'm lovin it
I shovelled shit all my life
And now i'm dumpin it on"

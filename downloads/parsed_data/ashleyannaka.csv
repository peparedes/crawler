Tonight was supposed to be fun, but Jackie decided not to go Trick-or-Treating with me the night b4 halloween. Even tho on the radio lots of ppl said thye were goin the 30th.. oh well. We would ahve been  the only ppl on the street, but again oh well. lol

"event","Only updating because I dont want to do my homework writing in here delays it. Tho its pointless since im pretty sure no one reads this but oh well.

Those three tests i mentioned in my last entry. I got a 94 on one of em. The other two, I dont know. Read my xanga for what i thought of them.

Sorry about the last post, but its truly how i feel and how i have felt. I guess its gettin better, no its not. OH well. I guess it will. Gina is slowly becoming one of my best friends, shes the one I talk to most, well ont he phone. I talk to xen most on the net. 

Ok enough of all that. 

Friday was good. I loved the pep rally theme, its just funny seeing guys dressed like that. lol I love it when we have Algebra tests, we get to have C lunch, i  like C better than B.. I likethe people in B, its just i dont ever getta see my frnds that are in C lunch, and i see my friends that are in B lunch ALL the time.. So.. C is better.. lol :) 

Saturday (yesterday) didnt do much (read xanga about it)
today didnt do really anything, still delaying doing my english thing ive known about for 3 weeks thats due tommorow, i know shame on me. but oh well. I'll do it, eventually. lol

Wow my throat hurts, i dont know why. oh well..

I dont want to go to school tommorow, lately ive been dreading school, I havent really done that EVERYDAY like this since. well 5th grade, well maybe 6th, only 'cause i hated English and the teacher (she was nice, i just didnt like what she taught therefore i didnt like her lol) But since 6th im pretty sure I mostly liked school.

I dont know why, lately, ive been dreading going. I dont have any tests or anything tommorow. oh wait nvm i just figured out why.. Chemistry- i'll prob find out what i got on that test and what i hve in that class.. and.. Med health- the horribly hard test, that everyone failed that the teacher wont curve. greaaaaat.. oh well, and english, presenting this project thign, that i havent done, that i dont want to do, that is to write a poem, prose, fiction or non-fiction short story, or drama. OR you can do some sorda art.. 

ah.. both im not very good at.. 

well I think ive written enough stuff that no one is going to read or comment on, so relaly theres no pt in typing all this anyway.. so i'll just stop now

"event","I feel like I annoy people...
No one looked at me funny or anything...
Its just.. I always seem to be the 3rd or 5th wheel.. 
Thats the bad part about starting life all over again.. (moving/changing schools-talkin about switching from private to public and moving back to houston from Sugar Land)

Ive noticed that more lately.. Everyone has their own lives that they sometimes try to include me in, but mostly.. They just want to hang out with those theyve known longer. It kinda.. I dont know.. 

I dont mind *THAT* much I suppose, but sometimes I wish I had what they had. A Best friend. One that I knew I could trust and hang out with all the time. Call at 4am. No matter what.

I had one at one time. WE've fallen apart now, We still talk, yes, but I feel like we no longer know eachother.

I had one before that, We also still talk, but we are TOTAL opposites now, so that is kinda well you can understand why that would be kinda weird.

I kinda hope no one will read this, I will probably be embarrassed or something about it later. Especially if you try to talk to me about this in person. I dont mind if you AIM, email or reply to this, just not in person, Unless i say so. 

I kinda wish I was back in middle school. 7th grade in particular. All my friends and I were together, we all were happy. LIfe was great then. :)

Or maybe.. ALl the way back to say 2nd grade. I was also happy then.

THings I woudlnt go back to.. 4th and 5th grade. those were the two worst years of my life in my 15.5 years of existence. 

I have no idea where I got all this from.. I dont know why I'm rambling on like this.

I feel liek typing and since to my knowledge, no one but dani, if she still reads this/if she did read this.. reads it. 

SO really theres no point except to type to myself. Ok now im talking to myself. I'll stop now

Life is actually ok right now, I dread school tommorow tho. 3 tests. I am afraid of my Chem grade. If i have a C im soo dead/grounded. Only because I lied and told my mom i was doing 'ok' in there, and didnt need help. THe truth is.. Im not doing 'ok' in there, and I do need help, well actually i dont, I understand how to do it, Its just i havent taken the time to memorize anything.. THats the whole class.. SO yeah.. NOT good

Well I guess I'll be quiet now. 

Even tho above I said I wished no one would read it, I really wish someone would comment/post whatever..

um.. Yeah. Tell me if you read it, tell me if you ever read it.. Please? Thanks.

Well enough of that.

HOw has your school year been going?

~Ash


ok well i do know why i feel like crying. Stupid PMS, but whatever."

I hate this.
Everytime those two kids from down the street come over I get in a bad mood or pissed off at no one in particular. They annoy me to DEATH.
Thats not the only thing contributing to this bad mood.
I have horrible cramps. Make it go away. Make the cramps and the non-stop bleeding and everything else that comes with it just go away. 

Ok wow, I dont think Ive ever said stuff like that on the net before, It feels kinda good, to let it all loose. Let it all go! :)

Well I feel alot better now, still aching, still annoyed by anything to moves, but I'll get over it :)

I wish I could drive. I hate having to be driven everywhere. It'd be nice to be able to drive myself somewhere, anywhere but stuck at home doing nothing.

Somewhere with friends I hardly see anymore. Somewhere exciting, somewhere but here.

Dont get me wrong, I like it here, but i hate being stuck doing absolutely nohting all weekend long, partially because I have no ride anywhere. My mom's new job, basically, requires her to work on weekends, She kinda has to if she wants to get enough people to participate in the thing she has to get them to do.

Oh well. 

Later I will probably get to go somewhere, I just hope my mom gets back before 6, well its 6 hours 'til then anyway, but I hope she does. 

Xenica's meeting thing is tonight at 6, so technically my mom hasta get back by 5:30, but whatever.

I also hope I can go to Xen's party tommorow as well, that will be fun :)!!

10.Am I shy or outgoing?
11.Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?
12.Can I sing?
13.Do I get along with my parents?
14.If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?

Went back and hung out by the car for awhile. Left after maybe 30 or so minutes of hanging out.

Went to this bay house that a former student has. Ate lunch and hung out there. 

Today was SOOO fun, I really had alot of fun, waaaaay more fun than ive had in a long time.. haha

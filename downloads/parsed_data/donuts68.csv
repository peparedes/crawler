"event","I would get rid of this but there are times when I get nostalgic and like remembering how I stupid I used to be. Funny to think how much has changed so I last posted on this lj.

But I guess the main thing is that I don&#39;t really care to talk about myself anymore. I&#39;m just not about that, not as much as I used to be. I used to have a lot to say about things but I generally keep it all to myself. I still write about film and what not but it&#39;s impersonal to me. I mean, films mean a lot to me but writing about them is an impersonal activity.

I try to channel my feelings into what I write in other areas like screenplays or short stories that I have come up with over the years. But lately, that well has been kind of try. It&#39;s moreso about me getting the motivation to write than anything else. I know the ideas are there, I just can&#39;t seem to get myself to go ahead with them.

I miss simpler times but I wouldn&#39;t trade where I am at now, obviously. I just feel a little too complacent sometimes. I&#39;m satisfied with where I am at right now, I love my wife, and I have a lot of hope for the future. Part of that includes getting my act together and pursuing filmmaking projects that I can ill-afford to put aside much longer. The good news is that I have a couple of film shoots that I&#39;ll be a part of this upcoming month and I plan to have a lot more going on for me in the near future. Main thing is, I just don&#39;t even plan on giving up on these dreams anytime soon. They&#39;re not dreams anymore, you know? I&#39;m a filmmaker and that&#39;s that. I wish I could do something more substantial and consistent to earn a paycheck but I have a feeling that I will get everything I want if I just keep doing what I&#39;m doing now. If I just keep plugging away, everything will be fine. Now&#39;s the time to do it before I start having kids and what not.

Anyway, I wrote way more than I intended. Nobody will read this."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a man who likes to put things into perspective, I come into the win that Penn State had against Ohio State with excitement and caution.&nbsp; Not that I don't believe PSU will be able to win out, I&nbsp;think that should be able to happen.&nbsp; It has to happen.&nbsp; This team is too disciplined to let a game against Iowa, Indiana, or Michigan State get out of hand.&nbsp; Besides, when you matchup our team against theirs, it seemed implausible for any of those team to have a clear advantage against us.&nbsp; That being said, we do have to get sexy on offense again, and fast.&nbsp; We did well in the 2nd half of the Michigan game, but we have to make sure we're able to come out firing like we did in the Wisconsin and Illinois games.&nbsp; We have to solidify our status as a well-balanced offensive team with great running backs, receivers, and a poised quarterback that has a great arm and the mobility to get out of pressure situations.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is.&nbsp; Penn State has a realistic chance to go 12-0 in the regular season right now and once again, like a few other undefeated teams that Joe Pa has coached... this team will face the same questions no matter what.&nbsp; Especially now.&nbsp; They beat Ohio State 13-6.&nbsp; So, I'm sure SEC or Big 12 fans are asking, &quot;So what?&quot;&nbsp; What's so great about PSU?&nbsp; Nevermind beating Michigan 46-17, Wisconsin 48-7, Illinois 38-24... that doesn't matter. &nbsp;Those teams are garbage anyway.&nbsp; It seems that PSU can't just beat the teams they play in the Big Ten. &nbsp;They have to REALLY beat them.&nbsp; I&nbsp;understand that clearly.&nbsp; Yet, that's so lame, isn't it?&nbsp; How does USC get anymore respect than PSU does when they lost to an Oregon State team that got manhandled earlier in the year by Penn State?&nbsp; USC beat a Beanie Wells-less Ohio State team lead by Todd Boeckman <em>in</em> LA.&nbsp; Penn State beat a Ohio State team that was lead by &quot;Freshmen phenom&quot; Terrelle Pryor and Beanie Wells.&nbsp; It was a hard fought defensive team, yet nobody wants to give Penn&nbsp;State's defense any credit&nbsp;(except the ones who actually know college football).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line is that Penn State fans will now have to endure criticism for the next 2 1/2 months.&nbsp; 2 1/2 months!&nbsp; Are you looking forward to it?&nbsp; I&nbsp;know I&nbsp;am!&nbsp; With every win:&nbsp; &quot;Oh so what?&nbsp; They beat Iowa!&nbsp; Big deal!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Michigan State?&nbsp; Who gives a shit?!&quot;&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; Then, when Penn State reaches the National Title game against either Alabama or&nbsp;Texas... leading up to that game will be Texas and Alabama fans who are absolutely sure that PSU will get crushed by their &quot;explosive offensives.&quot;&nbsp; Could that happen?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; And that's the thing.&nbsp; Penn State can't just win out in the regular season.&nbsp; They HAVE to win in the national championship game.&nbsp; They have to.&nbsp; If they don't, the Big Ten will be in terrible, terrible shape.&nbsp; Nobody will have any respect for the Big Ten.&nbsp; Pollsters won't want to let a Big Ten team into the national championship again because they fear another blowout.&nbsp; Penn State HAS to win every game they play this season.&nbsp; That's a lot of pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is assuming that Alabama or Texas will have at least one loss.&nbsp; And what if Texas Tech wins out?&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, Penn State has to withstand a lot in order to get to the BCS&nbsp;championship game.&nbsp; If both Alabama and Texas win out, then we can look forward to another undefeated PSU&nbsp;team that doesn't get awarded at least a share of the national championship game.&nbsp; That'll be the fourth time that has happened to Joe Paterno!&nbsp; 1968, 1969, 1973, 1994, 2008... wait... that's FIVE TIMES!&nbsp; Good God.&nbsp; C'mon, college football Gods.&nbsp; For the sake of <em>college football</em>, PSU has to win the national championship this year, or it'll never be the same.<br /><br />"

"event","In fact, it is probably my favorite year ever in the NFL.&nbsp; The ironic part is that the Steelers didn't even make the playoffs that year! &nbsp;But hey, I can accept that because what lead to them missing out on the playoffs was a meltdown by the Steelers of which I've never seen.&nbsp; That's not entirely their fault though.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially losing the Thanksgiving game against the Lions because of a botched coin flip could knock the wind out of any team.&nbsp; I remember how frustrated, confused, and angry I&nbsp;was about it and when I saw the Steelers go from 7-4 to 7-9, I wasn't even upset. &nbsp;I&nbsp;knew it wasn't entirely their fault.&nbsp; I felt their pain, so to speak. &nbsp;I think that was the first year I&nbsp;remember the Steelers not making the playoffs, I&nbsp;grew up watching the Steelers since Bill Cowher became coach. &nbsp;To me, Bill&nbsp;Cowher was synonymous with the Steelers so to see him go after the 2006 season was forcing me to accept change.&nbsp; It's ok though, I&nbsp;love Mike Tomlin.<br /><br />But that's beside the point.<br /><br />The first question you're going to ask me is, what's so bad about the NFL 1999-present?&nbsp; Well, nothing... not really.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, the Steelers won the Super Bowl in 2005, what's not to love about that?&nbsp; What a perfect way for Jerome Bettis to retire, right?&nbsp; The Steelers run in the latter part of the 2005 season was definitely fun to watch, but the whole season just wasn't that exciting to me.<br /><br />Let's go back to 1998 though.&nbsp; Look at who was still playing that year:<br /><br />John Elway<br />Dan Marino<br />Steve Young<br />Randall Cunningham<br />Warren Moon<br />Troy Aikman<br /><br />I say &quot;still&quot; because all of these quarterbacks were in their twilight of their legendary careers.&nbsp; 5/6 are already in the Hall of Fame, one of them will make it in eventually.&nbsp; And, it's not as if these guys were playing like old-timers.&nbsp; John Elway lead the Broncos to a Super Bowl victory.&nbsp; Dan Marino had a solid season and lead the Dolphins to the playoffs. &nbsp;Steve Young had one of his best years as a quarterback, statistically:&nbsp; 36 tds, 12 ints, 4,170 passing yards, 101.1 passer rating... did I&nbsp;mention all three of these quarterbacks were at least 37 years old?&nbsp; Don't forget Warren&nbsp;Moon, who didn't have such a hot season, but he still played pretty decent for being 42 years old... Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Troy Aikman had a great season too, but little did we know that this would be his last great season before he retired two seasons later at age 34.&nbsp; But the best story out of these six quarterbacks was Randall&nbsp;Cunningham.&nbsp; Cunningham had a career that was filled with amazing seasons and seasons where he was plagued by injury.&nbsp; Well, he came back this year on a friggin' mission.&nbsp; He had a bad injury the year before and came back putting up 34 touchdown passes and only 10 interceptions, and 3,704 passing yards.&nbsp; He was 35 years old, lead the Vikings to a 15-1 season, many people consider this one of the greatest teams to never win a Super Bowl.&nbsp; Ok, I consider them that.&nbsp; More on them later.<br /><br />We had more great stories with either up-and-coming quarterbacks and quarterbacks with a great comeback season.&nbsp; This includes:<br /><br />Brett Favre<br />Vinny&nbsp;Testaverde<br />Doug Flutie<br />Drew Bledsoe<br />Peyton Manning<br />Jake Plummer<br />Trent Green<br />Mark Brunell<br />Steve McNair<br />Chris Chandler<br />Rich Gannon<br /><br />If you're an NFL fan, you are bound to remember all of these guys.&nbsp; Some of these guys went on to have legendary careers, some of them went on to have solid careers, some... never could follow up their magical 1998 season.<br /><br />First, there's Brett Favre.&nbsp; He didn't have one of his best years this year, but he still threw for 4,212 yards and 31 td passes.&nbsp; It was the 5th year in a row that he threw for more than 30 touchdown passes.&nbsp; That is just sick and I don't think any quarterback will ever match that.&nbsp; Then, you have Vinny Testaverde!&nbsp; Come on, how great of a story is that?&nbsp; It's not some ridiculous &quot;where the hell did this guy come from?&quot; type of story either (like Kurt Warner in '99 or Tom Brady in '01)... this guy sucked in the NFL for over 10 seasons. &nbsp;Sure, he did go to the pro bowl in 1996 as a Raven... but who remembers that?&nbsp; No, 1998 was his true breakout year.&nbsp; Interceptions and Testaverde used to go together like peanut butter and jelly.&nbsp; Well, guess what bitches?&nbsp; This year, Vinny threw for 29 touchdown passes and 7 interceptions. He was awesome!&nbsp; According to pro-football-reference.com, his record with the Jets that season was 12-1.&nbsp; Vinny's overall QB&nbsp;record is 90-123-1... you see what I'm getting at?&nbsp; Who knows what was in his water this year, but he lead to Jets to a 12-4 record and all the way to the conference championship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />You know, that 12-1 record sounds pretty amazing, who can top that?&nbsp; Oh, I&nbsp;don't know, maybe Chris Chandler?&nbsp; He had a 13-1 record when he lead the 14-2 Falcons to the Super Bowl which we'll get to later. Chandler was pretty much a journeyman quarterback before he joined the Falcons in 1997 and he just exploded in 1998.&nbsp; Let's wrap this up quickly... Doug Flutie was a Heisman winner and later a CFL star, but he was considered too short to be an&nbsp;NFL QB.&nbsp; Well, he lead the Bills to a 10-6 record in 1998 and made the pro bowl.&nbsp; Did I&nbsp;mention he was 36 years old?&nbsp; I&nbsp;also wanna talk about Jake Plummer.&nbsp; Now when you look at his stats, they aren't spectacular, but he was playing for the CARDINALS.&nbsp; In his second season, he lead the Cardinals to their first playoff appearance since 1982 (which was a strike year so it doesn't really count so, 1975).&nbsp; He lead them to their first playoff victory since 1947!&nbsp; That is pretty amazing folks.<br /><br />Of course, we can talk about Peyton Manning breaking all kinds of rookie records in 1998, Drew Bledsoe leading the Pats to another playoff appearance, Trent Green and Rich Gannon finally showed the NFL that they deserve to be starters in the league... there are so many stories when it comes to quarterbacks, you could write a book about it.<br /><br />Now let's look at the rest of the players who played in 1998:<br /><br />Running backs - <br />Barry Sanders<br />Terrell Davis<br />Curtis Martin<br />Jerome Bettis<br />Marshall Faulk<br />Emmitt Smith<br />Eddie George<br />Jamal Anderson<br />Robert Smith<br />Ricky Watters<br /><br />You also had Warrick Dunn, Priest Holmes, Corey Dillon, and Fred Taylor who later went on to have solid careers in the NFL.<br /><br />Barry Sanders was in his last season, Terrell Davis and Jamal Anderson had such great seasons that they couldn't top. <br />Jerome Bettis, Curtis Martin, Marshall Faulk, and Eddie George were all in their prime.&nbsp; Robert Smith helped balance out the Vikings amazing offense.&nbsp; I feel you can't talk about the 1998 Vikings without talking about him.&nbsp; Emmitt Smith was still going strong and Ricky Watters had one last good season.<br /><br />Let's just go through other great players:<br />Jerry Rice, Tim&nbsp;Brown, Rod Smith, Keyshawn Johnson, Cris&nbsp;Carter, Jimmy Smith, Michael Irvin, Randy Moss, Eric Moulds, Terrell Owens, Herman Moore, Shannon Sharpe, Antonio Freeman, Larry Allen, Tony Boselli, Jonathan Ogden, Willie Roaf, Dermotti Dawson, Michael Strahan, Will&nbsp;Shields, Reggie White, Warren Sapp, John&nbsp;Randle, Bruce Smith, Mo Lewis, Ray Lewis, Bill Romanowski, Derrick Brooks, Chad Brown, Junior Seau, Ty Law, Charles Woodson, Deion Sanders, Rodney Harrison,&nbsp;Rod Woodson, Darren Woodson, LeRoy&nbsp;Butler<br /><br />Did I mention that kicker Gary Anderson had a perfect year?&nbsp; He missed no field goals or extra points and he kicked 35 field goals and 59 extra points.<br /><br />I know there are great players playing today, but just look at the combination of legendary players with young up-and-coming players that were soon to become great.&nbsp; I mean, you had Terrell Owens and Jerry Rice on the same team.&nbsp; You had Cris Carter and Randy Moss on the same team.&nbsp; <br /><br />You can't just say 1998 was a great year because of the players, obviously.&nbsp; I know that there are great players playing every year. &nbsp;I just wanted to point out the combination of all of them in the same year.&nbsp; And, yeah, to me, Barry Sanders and John Elway retiring this year... two of the greatest players to play in their position... that signaled a new era.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm going to finish this by going over the 1998 from a team standpoint.<br /><br />First we have to start off with the Super Bowl champs, the Denver Broncos.&nbsp; I think they were the last team, so far, to dominate in both offense and defense in a multiple year period while winning the Super Bowl.&nbsp; The '03-'04 Patriots had great defenses and of course... Tom Brady.&nbsp; But they didn't put up the kind of points that the Broncos did.&nbsp; I'm not denying that those Patriots teams were great teams, but I just think the '97-'98 Broncos had a better two year period regardless of the fact that the Patriots went 28-4 and Denver went 27-5. &nbsp;I'm talking from a purely statistical standpoint.&nbsp; Of course, what's even more fitting is that it was Elway's last two seasons as a Bronco.&nbsp; You know, we look at how Bettis and Strahan ended their careers with their teams while winning the Super Bowl and we think that those are great stories. &nbsp;They are.&nbsp; But, to have your team go 27-5, win two Super Bowls, and then retire?&nbsp; That's just insane.&nbsp; And you know, the Broncos had to beat the Jets and the Falcons to win the Super Bowl, both teams were on magical runs and we'll start with the Jets.<br /><br />Simply saying that the Jets went 12-4 is amazing, but the fact that they started off at 0-2 (and later, 2-3) to go on to 12-4, that's even more amazing.&nbsp; THEN, to say that Vinny&nbsp;Testaverde was the quarterback that lead them there... ok, what the hell?&nbsp; This is truly an awesome story right here.&nbsp; Bill Parcells improved the team noticeably the year before from 1-15 to 7-9.&nbsp; I'm sure Jets fans were just happy to see their team become competitive again.&nbsp; But to go 12-4 is just unbelievable.&nbsp; It wasn't a fluke either.&nbsp; This Jets team was ranked 4th in offense and 7th in defense.&nbsp; They had 5 pro-bowlers.&nbsp; Curtis Martin and Keyshawn Johnson had breakout years.&nbsp; They were 5th in scoring and 2nd in giving up points. &nbsp;The fact that the Broncos were able to beat this team so handily is very impressive.&nbsp; And, of course, this season makes you wonder what could've happened in 1999 if Vinny Testaverde didn't get hurt in week 1.<br /><br />The Atlanta Falcons were so fun to watch in 1998.&nbsp; While the Broncos and the Jets were going on their own runs, the Falcons decided to become good also.&nbsp; They went 14-2 and was lead by Chris Chandler who had a breakout year and Jamal Anderson... nobody could stop him that year.&nbsp; <br /><br />Did I&nbsp;mention that the Vikings went 15-1?&nbsp; They had Cunningham, Robert Smith, Cris Carter, and Randy Moss?&nbsp; That they held the record for most points scored in a season until the Patriots broke that in 2007?&nbsp; Yeah well guess what?&nbsp; The Falcons beat them in the Conference Championship.&nbsp; That's how fucking crazy this season was!&nbsp; The Minnesota Vikings looked unstoppable throughout the season until the Falcons... stopped them. &nbsp;And then, to top all that, the Broncos (remember them?) beat the Falcons in the Super Bowl!&nbsp; In my honest opinion, I&nbsp;think that in any other year, the Vikings and the Falcons could win the Super Bowl with their teams easily.&nbsp; The fact that all three of these teams were playing in the same year is just incredible.<br /><br />I also want to point out the fact that this was the last year that the Packers and 49ers faced in each other in the playoffs with Steve Young, Brett Favre, Mike Holmgren, Steve Mariucci, Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens, Reggie White... all inside the same stadium.&nbsp; And what followed was one of the greatest playoff games of all time.&nbsp; The 49ers had a great team that year, they were having a great team every year since the '80s at this point.&nbsp; Even though they would later make the playoffs with Jeff Garcia, it wasn't the same as it was when Joe Montana/Steve Young were the quarterbacks and Jerry Rice was the main receiver.&nbsp; That was something you expected to happen every year. &nbsp;You expected either the&nbsp;Packers, Cowboys, or 49ers to face each other at some point the playoffs during the '90s.&nbsp; Eventually all three of them won the Super Bowl in the '90s.&nbsp; This was the last year where the 49ers and the Cowboys still had most of the same players that made those teams so memorable.&nbsp; The Cowboys went 10-6 and lost to the Cardinals in the playoffs.&nbsp; This would signal the end of the Cowboys' era officially.&nbsp; It would take almost a decade until they were able to gather enough talent to be considered serious Super Bowl contenders.<br /><br />The Cardinals story is special because it's not like they went from a 4-12 season to a 13-3 season like the Rams did in '98-'99.&nbsp; Now, this was the same Cardinals team as always.&nbsp; They weren't that good in 1998... if you look at them on paper.&nbsp; But they found a way to win 9 games that year lead by 2nd year quarterback Jake Plummer.&nbsp; They somehow managed to pull it off and to beat the Cowboys, of all teams, in the playoffs is just... special.<br /><br />In summation, like I said before, there are a lot of great moments that happened since the 1998-99 season.&nbsp; The Rams-Titans super bowl is still probably the greatest super bowl I've ever seen.&nbsp; But think about it what the NFL&nbsp;was like in the 90s.&nbsp; Like I said, every year, the Cowboys, Niners, and Packers made the playoffs, it seemed.&nbsp; 1998 was the last year that this happened with all the same familiar faces that you saw every year.&nbsp; There's a lot of parity in the NFL now.&nbsp; A team that makes the Super Bowl this year, may not make it the next year.&nbsp; Sure, that makes things exciting because you don't know who to expect in the playoffs in any year.&nbsp; The fact that the Patriots and Colts are able to make the playoffs every year in this era is just astounding considering the amount of parity that happens.&nbsp; 1998 was the beginning of that parity happening, if you look at it.&nbsp; I mean, the Falcons?&nbsp; The Vikings?&nbsp; The Vikings had decent enough teams in the '90s, but they were never <em>that</em> good.&nbsp; 1998 was the year it all came together for them.&nbsp; Cardinals making the playoffs?&nbsp; Jets going 12-4?&nbsp; Yeah, parity definitely still existed in the 1998.&nbsp; But, it co-existed with the great dynasties that were the Packers, Cowboys, Broncos, and Niners.&nbsp; After this year, those dynasties broke down.&nbsp; Now we only really have the Colts and Patriots every year.&nbsp; The NFC is only finally starting to come together. &nbsp;The AFC has a lot of good teams, but only two great teams every year.&nbsp; It seems like any year a supposed other &quot;great&quot; team comes along, another team winds up surprising them.&nbsp; The Giants beating the 18-0 Patriots?&nbsp; Peyton&nbsp;Manning and the Colts finally won the Super Bowl in 2006, but they should've won it in 2005.&nbsp; I'm glad the Steelers beat the Colts that year to win the Super Bowl, but the Colts in 2005 had that feel of a historic-type team.&nbsp; The 2006 Chargers also had that feeling and they blew it too.&nbsp; The 2007 Patriots seemed to resemble the 1994 49ers in that they stocked up on talent and wound up dominating. &nbsp;But the fact that they lost in the Super Bowl just ruins the whole season; the whole historical factor of their team is just gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The past three years in the NFL seemed to signify that all you need to do is have a great late season run and you can win the Super Bowl.&nbsp; There's no sense of total domination throughout the season, there's no sense of truly great teams (except for the Colts and Patriots, once again) playing against each other annually and it means something.&nbsp; I will say this, as a sign of optimism, I&nbsp;think the NFL is on the verge of having stronger teams overall.&nbsp; We're starting to see more consistency at the quarterback position with multiple teams.&nbsp; Over the years, teams like the Broncos, Chargers, Steelers, Cowboys, Packers, and Giants should start to show some consistency every year with their young quarterbacks as all are showing signs of greatness.&nbsp; To me, it's more fun to watch great football teams play each other every year, then to have a surprise team come out of nowhere and make a run to the Super Bowl.&nbsp; Or, at least, win the damn Super Bowl if you're actually that good.&nbsp;

"event","It would be unreasonably pessimistic of me to call my life so far a bunch of missed opportunities.  After all, where I am right now isn't that bad of a situation.  Who knows where I'd be if I had been more of an active participant in my life, rather than a passive observer.  Sure it may seem like that at some point I took charge of my life and steered in a good direction.  I'm not denying that I am partly responsible.  But part of me feels that I was meant to end up where I am now anyway and I only did everything in my power not to be a total failure.  Well, congrats to that, right?  I mean, one should take pride in not making stupid decisions with their life, but sometimes I feel like there were decisions I could've made in the past that I didn't make, but I should've made.

Most of these cases are with women, too.  Is that really a surprise though?  You know I've come to the opinion that it really isn't that hard to pursue a woman or get one to like you.  It really isn't, and I've probably had my chances with women that I can name off the top of my head.  The problem is that it seems all those chances are way gone and if I were to even begin to try to pursue any of those women, I'd be thought of as a stalker.  Don't worry, wasn't thinking about going down that road.

But, looking back, there always seemed to be many different paths to relationships for me, and I kept going down the wrong one, or missing them completely.  One wonders if this will be a neverending thing for me.  I can't honestly go that much longer into my life without finding a woman that really means something to me, can I?  The problem is that there probably have been opportunities for this to happen before but I just didn't let myself make it happen.  Even now I feel this urge not to do anything when put in that situation.  And why?  What's the worst that can happen?  It makes no sense to be like that.  I realize this and yet I keep falling down that unfortunate path.  As I've mentioned before, when I do get involved in a relationship, it feels completely unnatural and something that I want to get out of.  I feel a large part of the reason for that is because it is something that I didn't go after.  What I need - I need to successfully go after someone who I feel has some interest in me.  I feel the satisfaction of getting to that point is something that I've been looking for all this time.  What's it gonna take for me to make a good move?  I'm not really sure, but I do know that as time goes on, I have less and less to lose when it comes to taking a chance.  And more to lose when it comes to not taking a chance.  So, why can't I fucking do it?"

"event","I have never understood the willingness to be dumb.  The one thing I learned in high school was that popular/cool kids can be in smart classes.  But, there is still this idea that being dumb is cool.  This has continued on through the internet where people have stopped learning how to type properly.  They use shorthand after shorthand and butcher the English language in the process.  It's really sad that this is what we have become.  You know, it's not very hard to type like this.  Now I don't mean to place myself above others of my age, in general, as I'm sure there are plenty out there like me who actually have a vocabulary that they can use extensively.  My problem is that there seems to be this push towards typing with shorthand and, to me, it would seem that it takes more time to remember what the shorthands are for longer words anyway.  So why not just type normally?  There's nothing cool about coming off like a retard.  I'm not asking people to type like geniuses; just type.  This really isn't hard.

I had somewhat understood why bullies picked on smart kids.  I think the main reason is that ""nerds"" or ""geeks"" really do it to themselves.  I managed to go throughout elementary, intermediate, and high school without getting my ass kicked, so why do other people have problems?  I'm not ""cool"" or anything but I managed to get by.  And you know, there wasn't really a ""bully"" that existed.  There wasn't anybody I knew who seemed to deliberately try to make a geek have a bad day.  It seemed to me that the kids that were bullied during those school years acted so dumb and had no sense of humor.  I managed to go through school with a sense of humor.  I was able to make fun of myself and laughed when people made fun of me.  The only time I took things seriously was when we were playing sports.  Yes, I cried when I lost a kickball game, but what's wrong with that?  Sports are serious shit, man.

But, you know what it is?  I felt so inferior when it came to almost all sports.  I don't know why I was so bad, maybe I just didn't have the right attitude.  I was just terrible at almost every sport out there, but I managed to get by.  At the same time, it is undeniable that I'd get upset whenever we lost a game in whatever sport that was being played because I'd always feel that it was directly my fault.  Sometimes it was.  There was just this overall feeling that'd go through me and it felt like I personally failed everytime I lost a game.  It didn't matter to me that the game meant nothing in general.  I wanted to prove that I was good at something.

I never really got picked on about that though.  I mean, I did.  However, it wasn't something that people really got on me for.  I did get picked on somewhat for sucking at a lot of sports, but that only lasts until the end of whatever game that's being played.  As I've grown up, I've learned to deal with losses more gracefully.  I've also grown my sense of humor.  I'd say high school was the best version of me because my main goal was just to make people laugh and be completely nonsensical at times.  I also made sure that I was doing it in a smart way.  I'd never call what I did back then ""dumb humor"" because I always had a point to whatever joke I was making.  There was always some ironic twist going on.  I wasn't always deliberately trying to do that.  As junior and senior year came along, it was just something that I did naturally.  I'm just glad most people caught along to it.

Anyway, so, I guess what I'm saying is that people should just lighten the hell up.  You can avoid many ass beatings that way."

"event","Maybe you are wondering what I have done in the past few years or months or however long it's been since you've heard from me last.  I don't know who reads this or if anybody reads this, but I like to pretend in my head that this is the most famous blog in all of livejournal.  

What Myspace and facebook are good for is the fact that I can look to see how many failures/screwups there were who graduated at the same time and place I did.  Is it a bit mean to think of it in that manner?  I suppose.  There are times when it's just weird, knowing that you used to see these people around everyday of your school life and now they are out doing whatever it is they're doing.  The people on facebook are generally in college and are doing well for themselves, the people on myspace (who aren't on facebook) are kind of in the opposite situation.  But, maybe, I have the wrong perspective.  I look and see a few who have had kids and a family; I think to myself ""wow, already?""  But am I supposed to laugh and feel sorry for them?  I guess not.  I guess that you can be happy by already having a kid and to be married... of course, if it's a single mother than the connotations surrounding that are much bleaker.  But, nonetheless, I am actually envious of those people in a way.  I look at my own life and find myself lacking that certain feeling that everyone else has in their life.  I mean, I've actually gone through a relationship this past winter/spring, but it is nothing worth talking about.  Trust me.  The bottom line is that I find myself right back where I started:  single.  I've had this lj for over four years and I've always lamented and complained about the same thing:  the fact that I'm single.  

I always wind up blaming myself and all that usual crybaby nonsense.  But, it's not that I'm depressed or upset about it because I am doing pretty well for myself otherwise.  I'm a year away from being a Penn State graduate.  Tomorrow I'm going to NYC to interview for an internship and if I get it that means I'll be interning for a production company in NYC.  How sweet is that?  I like it.

And yet, I still wonder what my life would be like if I didn't go to college, found someone locally, married them, had a kid, lived my life that way.  My personal philosophy is to go out there, experience the broad spectrum of life, then settle down and have kids.  But, people choose to just settle down and have kids.  I suppose it wouldn't be such a bad thing to have that.  But of course, then you'd have a low-paying job and may be struggling to pay bills.  I've seen how many parents manage and I don't think I'd want to be in that position exactly.

No, this is what I have to do.  I have to be a member of my family who succeeds and I can't hope for the possibility of walking into a successful situation at age 40.  I can't do that.  This is what needs to be done.  This is the path I have to go down.  I'm gonna do it too.  I am determined to do it.

So this is for anybody who stumbled upon my livejournal and wondered, ""What has Ken been doing lately?""  Well, here's a surprise for you, I am doing pretty damn well for myself.  I don't know what fellow classmates expected from me back in high school or intermediate school, but here I am.  Take it as you will."

"event","I'm undecided as to where I should blog these days, but I've decided to do a little stint back on livejournal just for awhile, anyway.  I wanted to be cool and hip by switching off to the cutting edge that is blogspot.com, but I can't help but dig the nostalgic aura that surrounds lj.  

A part of me kind of misses Toms River, NJ.  Don't get me wrong, I'm here.  I've been back in town for over a week now, but I hardly talk to anyone.  I hardly talk to any of my ""friends"" in Toms River.  I put friends in quotations because I'm undecided as to whether or not the people I talked to here were really my friends or not.  Hell, I'm still undecided as to whether or not the people I talk to in State College are my friends.

I seem to have a hard time opening up to people.  I have no problem with hanging out and partying, but I do not seem to do much of that anymore as well.  It feels like whenever I do becomes friends with someone, it usually lasts until they get sick of me.  I don't seem to make a lasting impression on people.  The people I used to talk to in Toms River don't want to give me the time of the day nowadays.  At least, not really.  Maybe that's my fault.  I just wish I knew where I could fix that.  I don't think of myself as a bad person, and it seems dumb people can hang onto friends longer than me.  So, I'm really kind of confused about it all.  I think of myself as a pretty normal, regular guy.  But, I don't know, something must've happened to me along the way that has turned me into a bit of a loner.  It's nothing that I actively seek towards doing, but alas, I often find myself in the midst of it.  I guess that's just me, a loner.  If only I was a cool loner, like a kind of rebel.  Then I can say that I'm rebelling on what society views as groups and cliques.  But, that's not the case here.  I'm just a loser.  That's all it is.  Whenever people try coming to me to have fun, I just push them away.  I push everyone away until I have nothing.  I live with my folks everyday and everyday I think about wanting to live by myself.  It's terrible and I don't know why I feel that way.  I wish that doesn't happen if and when I ever find a steady relationship.  I don't think it would go that far, but I'd have to get into one in the first place.  It's funny though because when I do find myself in a relationship, I always think to myself that I'm in an undesirable situation.  As soon as I'm in the relationship, I do not find the person I'm with to be that great.  

You can pinpoint the problem there on me, but you know, I never really allowed myself to think clearly when I got into those situations.  Really, it was the woman who wanted me, more than I wanted the woman.  The problem would often be that I didn't want the woman at all.  Then I wind up alone, again, then I complain to myself.  It's a vicious, stupid cycle.  

I don't even know if I'm complaining here.  I'm merely just stating what has come to be the truth.  I'm not afraid to admit any of this and I sure as hell am not afraid to tell everyone.  I just wish I could fix myself in this manner.  I wish I knew where to start.  I feel like I've burned every social bridge in Toms River and I'm in the process of burning them in State College.  I mean, there's nobody there I talk to on a regular basis, I don't keep in touch with anybody there when I'm home.  It's just strange.  I just don't feel close to anybody, not even my family.  There's nobody around that I could say for a fact that I really felt close to.  And everytime, I just know that it's my fault.  It has to be.  I don't make the efforts necessary to open myself up and be friendly with people.  Everytime I'm given the opportunity, I just don't go after it.  It's the same way with women, too.  I blow every possible opportunity I may have with a woman because I can't let my guard down and just let loose.  

These are all problems that I have to address within myself.  I hope I do one day, but until then I'll just be hanging out being the way I am.  I'm trying to find a job this summer.  It's like I'm in the same situation I was in last summer.  This time, however, I have to change the way I do things.  I have to get a job, I have to be productive.  I'm hoping that if everything turns out well, then I'll be in Los Angeles in the fall.  That would surely be a step in the right direction.  Maybe I shouldn't be so depressed, then.  Because, you know what?  I do have something coming up in the horizon and I just have to grab at it.  That's what I plan on doing.  Hopefully I can become less of a loner in the process.  I do want to be more open and more friendly, I hope I can become that."

"event","Every other blog I've made on here is just bullshit. You know it, I know it, anyone in the world who reads it knows that. It means nothing. It's oh so insignificant. I realize now that I've got a lot that I should appreciate and I shouldn't bitch and moan just because one slight thing doesn't go my way.

But, friends, what I'm about to talk about now is not bullshit. This is pure. This is something I won't regret reading in twenty years. It's something that I just can't bottle up for the rest of my life or keep away from other people. I don't want people to think that I think I have it worse than anyone else. There are people all over the world who has life one hundred times worse than me and I guess I should have no reason to complain about anything right?

This is not me complaining or moaning. This is me mourning and grieving. This is regret, pain, loss, and confusion. This is me calling out to everyone who reads to this and understands what I'm saying. Now I've talked to a few people before and they made feel better. They're not around all the time. My family is around more, but they're going through this worse than I am. That doesn't mean I don't feel as bad as them, but they're going through the same things I am and I just can't get a good perspective on things when I talk to them. I tried. But they're all thinking the same things I am, I'm sure. They're all wondering, or have wondered the things that I've wondered. And what I'm 100% positive with is that I'm sure they all have the same pain I do. That's what it is. It's pain. I feel a pain in my stomach and my heart pounds in my chest. I'm trying to just forget about it and think of something else, but it's impossible when I feel the pain that I do. I know that I can't just let it sit there so what can I do? How can I cope through my grandfather's death? How am I gonna feel when my own mother dies? Will I feel worse? Should I not feel so bad? I know I'm supposed to remember all the good times, but when I do I just feel like crying. It's gone. The memories will be there, but I'll never be able to make more memories with him. It'll all end the same way. We lost our bond at the end. We just weren't as close as I wish we were before he died. I haven't had a heartfelt talk with him in years. Even then, he was drunk. It's just I feel bad. And I can't help it. I just do. It won't let go no matter how hard I try to make it go away. What am I gonna do? I never felt this pain before. I never felt this grief before. Other people have dealt with this a countless number of times before, but I could never understand what they were going through because I never went through it. Now I'm going through it for the very first time and no matter how many people tell me that what I'm feeling is normal, my heart and stomach just don't receive that message. It's those things that make me feel this way. I just hate this feeling and I want it to go away, but I know I'll have to live with it. I'll be fine in the head. I think I'm strong enough mentally. I haven't broken down or cried, I just feel sad. But it's a prolonged sadness. It just doesn't go away no matter what. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm supposed to get help. It's normal to feel this way, right? Am I fine? I'm sorry if you're reading this and rolling your eyes, but I just don't know how to react. I figured this is the best way to let it out. Just tell everyone and let them come up with their own opinion. You don't have to say anything to me, but just read this. Take it in and reflect. Did you feel this way when someone close to you died? Did you feel different? I don't think about heaven or the afterlife. I don't believe in them. I'm selfish. I want to see my grandfather again one more time. Heaven doesn't comfort me. It just reminds me how little time we have on here. Nothing is guaranteed. At some point, some way, I'll never see somebody ever again. There's nothing I can do about it. Every memory I have will remind me of that. Can I just dwell in the memories? Sure it gives me a brief moment of happiness, but the sadness will soon follow. I just know I'm always going to feel this way whenever I think about my grandfather in the future. He lived a relatively long life, but he suffered through the end of it. He could barely walk. He was just well on his way. I should have known. I should've taken it into consideration. But I figured I'd see him one more time. I didn't think he would die for at least another few years. However, I was simply ignorant of it all. No matter how realistic you are, you're always still a bit naive. And I guess I am with my family. I always think they'll be there, but at some point they won't. In this case, this is it. I'll never see my grandfather, I'll never talk to him. This is just it. Get over it, right? I wish I could, but I can't. Hopefully, I will eventually, but for now I'm just gonna be like this for awhile. I don't want to be, but it's just how I feel. I can't help it. I'm sure most people understand that and I hope they take all this into serious consideration. I don't feel good. I don't feel good at all. No matter what, I don't. And I just have to get it out. I have to try to get this out of my system in every way I can. That is all I can do right now and, unfortunately, anyone who reads this will have to bear with it. I'm sure I'll be back to my normal self eventually, but for now this is me. I'll try to put a smile on my face, I'll try to occupy myself in other ways. But, it's going to be hard. There's no denying that. And for now, this is what I'll leave you with. When I do feel better, I'll let you know. I will. I know I will. This feeling won't last forever, but it exists now. I'm just trying to find anyway to get it out.

For those who want to know what happened in more detail:

My grandpa died on Wednesday. For the past year, he's been living in Whiting, NJ where there's a old folks community. He had his own house and stuff, but it was in a neighborhood with a bunch of old people. My mom and little sister would usually go there every Friday or Saturday to bring him groceries and take care of him or hang out with him. In the beginning, when I could, I'd tag along but they'd stay there so late and all he'd do was just sit there and drink til he got drunk that I just didn't like being there. For the whole summer, my mom and little sis would go see him on the weekend and I'd never go. Yesterday afternoon, my mom asked me if I wanted to go and I declined as usual. An hour or so later, I got a phone call from my mother but she wanted to speak to my stepdad. I gave him the phone outside, he shortly came inside in a panic and soon went over to Whiting where she was. I had no idea what happened and he didn't indicate anything so all I thought was maybe she got in a car accident. Two hours later, my older sister calls me and told me that grandpa died. He was found sitting on the toilet with his head leaning on the sink. He died peacefully. My mom and little sister came home a few hours later and they were both crying. My mom was able to keep her composure quite a bit, but my 9 year old sister was hysterical. Luckily, she didn't have to see him like he was and my mom told her that she found him on his bed. But it was just very painful. I felt especially bad because I hadn't seen him all summer. The last time I saw him was in March during Spring Break. I planned on seeing him at least once before I went back to school, now I regret procrastinating this whole time. But when my relatives came over after going coffin shopping with my mom, they were all talking about the last things he gave them before he passed. That's when I realized that the Guitar Hero II that I was playing on Wednesday all day was the last gift he gave to me. I don't know if I'll be able to play it ever again.

I'll miss him. I wish I could've said goodbye properly, but I won't dwell in that. That's not my fault. It'll just be hard to get over all this.

If you read this, thank you."

"event","What Miami and FIU displayed yesterday was probably one of the most disgusting and shameful acts in college football history.&nbsp; All hell broke loose.&nbsp; Now I know FIU started it, but that gives Miami the excuse to act completely barbaric and stupid?&nbsp; Some of the fighting was street fighting, probably things the players learned when they grew up in the streets.&nbsp; Seriously, Miami is one of the dirtiest football programs in the nation.&nbsp; No, the dirtiest.&nbsp; They recruit dirty, stupid players.&nbsp; When a classy football program doesn't want to sign a football player cause the guy can't get a 700 on his SATs, Miami will sign him with no problem.&nbsp; They are the worst program in sports and should be ashamed of themselves.&nbsp; See for yourself:&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CvKD8Wzm1I

"event","Yeah, yeah, it's my 19th birthday.&nbsp; Thanks to the 3 people besides my family who wished me a happy birthday.&nbsp; I guess I have no friends.

But whatever, it's college football Saturday, and what a weekend.&nbsp; I couldn't wait to configure my new top 25.&nbsp; So, let's have at it.

1.&nbsp; Ohio State (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 37-7 vs Cincinnati
2.&nbsp; USC (3-0)&nbsp; Last game:&nbsp; 28-10 vs Nebraska
3.&nbsp; Auburn&nbsp; (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 7-3 vs LSU (previous ranking:&nbsp; 4)
4.&nbsp; WVU (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 45-24 vs Maryland (previous ranking:&nbsp; 6)
5.&nbsp; Florida&nbsp; (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 21-20 @ Tennessee (previous ranking:&nbsp; 8)
6.&nbsp; Louisville (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 31-7 vs Miami (FL) (previous ranking:&nbsp; 10)
7.&nbsp; Michigan (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 47-21 @ Notre Dame (previous ranking:&nbsp; 13)
8.&nbsp; Georgia (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 34-0 vs UAB (previous ranking:&nbsp; 10)
9.&nbsp; Texas (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 52-7 @ Rice (previous ranking:&nbsp; 5)
10.&nbsp; LSU (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 3-7 @ Auburn (previous ranking:&nbsp; 3)
11.&nbsp; Virginia Tech (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 36-0 vs Duke (previous ranking:&nbsp; 12)
12.&nbsp; Clemson (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 27-20 @ FSU (previous ranking:&nbsp; 22)
13.&nbsp; Oregon (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 34-33 vs Oklahoma (previous ranking:&nbsp; 24)
14.&nbsp; Oklahoma&nbsp; (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 33-34 @ Oregon (previous ranking:&nbsp; 11)
15.&nbsp; Iowa&nbsp; (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 27-17 vs Iowa State (previous ranking:&nbsp; 18)
16.&nbsp; Notre Dame (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 21-47 vs Michigan (previous ranking:&nbsp; 9)
17.&nbsp; Boston College (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 30-23 vs BYU (previous ranking: 17)
18.&nbsp; Tennessee (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 20-21 vs Tennessee (prevoius ranking:&nbsp; 14)
19.&nbsp; TCU (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 12-3 vs Texas Tech (previous ranking:&nbsp; 21)
20.&nbsp; Penn State (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 37-3 vs Youngstown St. (previous ranking:&nbsp; 20)
21.&nbsp; Florida State (2-1) Last game:&nbsp; 20-27 vs Clemson (previous ranking:&nbsp; 15)
22.&nbsp; Arizona State (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 21-3 @ Colorado (previously unranked)
23.&nbsp; Boise State (3-0)&nbsp; Last game:&nbsp; 17-10 @ Wyoming (prevous ranking:&nbsp; 23)
24.&nbsp; California (2-1)&nbsp; Last game:&nbsp; 42-16 vs Portland State (previous ranking:&nbsp; 25)
25.&nbsp; Alabama (3-0) Last game:&nbsp; 41-7 vs Louisiana-Monroe (previously unranked)


Miami out of my top 25 by getting crushed to Louisville.&nbsp; They are 1-2 and they suck. Nebraska is also out of there because of their loss to USC although they would be 26, I'm not gonna forget them altogether.&nbsp; Alabama have been pretty impressive so far as have Arizona State, but I don't know how much I believe in them because they haven't been too consistent with their gameplay.&nbsp; Penn State kinda played average against a 1-AA team, I wasn't too impressed.&nbsp; TCU beat a better team and deserve to be above PSU.&nbsp; Lot of changes as you can see, Texas moves down because they played Rice and beat them while Michigan, Florida, and Louisville played much better teams and beat them convincingly.&nbsp; So many teams in the bottom of the top 25 won, meanwhile some teams in the middle there lost so that's why teams like Oregon and Clemson moved up so high since they beat those ranked teams.&nbsp; What a great weekend.&nbsp;"

"event","This year in music has been filled with disappointments and pleasant surprises so far.&nbsp; I can only hope that it continues to surprise.&nbsp; But the latest album to come out that has really caught my attention is the just released album by Yo La Tengo.&nbsp; It's fantastic.&nbsp; I thought Bob Dylan's ""Modern Times"" was by far the best record I've heard this year (I know, it's a critical favorite too, but goddamn it <em>is</em> amazing).&nbsp; But YLT's new album ""I am not afraid of you and I will beat your ass"" lives up to its title.&nbsp; The very first track on the record is near-11 minutes of pure bliss.&nbsp; An unrelenting and killer rhythm complemented by Ira Kaplan's ferocious guitar work.&nbsp; The thing about that is their last two albums were more atmospheric and hardly had much guitar at all and Ira Kaplan is an excellent and innovative guitarist.&nbsp; Well, he comes back with a vengeance on the very first track and doesn't let go until 11 minutes later when the even better, shorter, poppier ""Beanbag Chair"" plays.&nbsp; YLT is not afraid to make a complete 180 with their sound and they do it perfect here.&nbsp; After that, everything seems to flow together with a band that for awhile, seemed as if they were running out of ideas.&nbsp; Now it seems like they've been reborn and rocking out harder than ever before.&nbsp; Some of the songs are a challenge to listen to (at least 3 songs on here are over 8 minutes in length), but each song is a rewarding listen.&nbsp; It's a relief to have such a great album like this released this year especially since Mars Volta and Outkast's new albums are both disappointing.&nbsp; I applaud both for going into different directions with their experimentations, but not all experiments work.&nbsp; Mars Volta are too wild, they can't be pinned down.&nbsp; They try so many things and sometimes it works and other times it is just a mess.&nbsp; Yo La Tengo aren't afraid to experiment either, but they know how to experiment without going off track and losing focus on what they're trying to make.&nbsp; Too much of something is never good and the more you experiment the more sidetracked you get with different sounds and styles.&nbsp; You have to keep certain focus, have a focal point in each song.&nbsp; That's why Pink Floyd's experimental albums such as ""Animals"" worked so well.&nbsp; They never lost focus, and it just seems as if Mars Volta can't maintain focus on one sound.&nbsp; Some people might enjoy that, but there's a different between something that's challenging to listen to and something you can't even follow.&nbsp; So, while I applaud Mars Volta for their uncomprising experiment and their hard-as-balls work ethic, I just can't seem to <u>enjoy</u> what they're making.&nbsp; And, to me, that's at least the most important thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows, I only listened to the album once.&nbsp; I'll give it another chance. <br /><br />Other great albums this year so far:<br />Bob Dylan - <em>Modern Times<br /></em>Sonic Youth - <em>Rather Ripped</em><br />The Roots - <em>Game Theory</em><br />Neil Young - <em>Living with War</em><br />Built to Spill - <em>You In Reverse</em><br /><br />Albums I'm looking forward to this year:<br />Nas - <em>Hip-Hop Is Dead<br /></em>Beck - <em>The Information<br /></em>The Decemberists - <em>The Crane Wife<br /></em>Mos Def - <em>Tru3 Magic</em><br />Deftones - <em>Saturday Night Wrist </em>(although not entirely impressed with ""A Hole in the Earth"")<br />The Who - <em>Endless Wire<br /></em>Guns N Roses - <em>Chinese Democracy</em> (come on Axl, release the fucker already)<br />Kanye West - <em>Graduation<br /></em>Modest Mouse - <em>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank<br /></em>Jay-z - <em>Ten Years Later... </em>(ha, who actually believed he really retired?)<br /><br />- later"

"event","Well, as I'm certainly in no mood to go anywhere after that horrific loss Penn State had against Notre Dame, I decided to take the time to write about something that I wanted to talk about musically.<br /><br />Maybe the fact that today's music scene is particularly lacking, but here's what I've got to say...I miss blink-182.&nbsp; <br /><br />What?<br /><br />Yeah, that's right.&nbsp; I miss good ol' blink-182.&nbsp; A band I enjoyed briefly during my intermediate school years.&nbsp; However, I listened to Korn and Limp Bizkit back then too and you don't hear me missing them.&nbsp; But, here's the thing:&nbsp; I recently listened to ""Enema of the State"" for shits and giggles, and it still a damn catchy album.&nbsp; No filler, 12 catchy songs clocking in at about 30 minutes.&nbsp; It doesn't have the guttural punch of Rancid at their best or emotional depth like Green Day at their best, it's just pure fun.&nbsp; Catchy songwriting without getting too annoying.&nbsp; Even Tom DeLonge's voice isn't too annoying as it now has become in his new Angels &amp; Airwaves band.&nbsp; Yeah, I never liked his voice to begin with, but for some reason it works with blink-182's snotty, adolescent sound.&nbsp; I find, or have found Mark's voice to be a little more pleasant and it's a departure from a typical punk rock singer.&nbsp; He doesn't whine.&nbsp; I guess that's why I liked him.&nbsp; Especially when you got bands today such as Taking Back Sunday and Fall Out Boy who have singers with <em>incredibly</em> annoying voices.&nbsp; It's irritating.&nbsp; <br /><br />Out of the late 90s-early 00s pop-punk bands, blink-182 were the best and the most successful.&nbsp; They were catchier than the Offspring too, who relied too much on anthemic songs rather than tightning up their structure.&nbsp; Blink-182, however, by the third album had really tightened up their sound and the way they did that was with Travis Barker.&nbsp; This guy is a great drummer and he is what makes (or made) blink-182 a credible band.&nbsp; Looking behind their success during the TRL era, you see a band who took the immaturity and snottiness of punk rock (a la the Descendents and NOFX) and turned into incredibly successful, radio-friendly, and above-all catchy songs.&nbsp; Their fourth album was a bit half-and-half and that was when I started losing interest in them.&nbsp; I guess it's hard to maintain a certain level of immaturity (although NOFX did it for years...and now THEY'RE starting to become serious).&nbsp; There are some lesser successful pop-punk bands during this time that were just as good as blink-182.&nbsp; Guttermouth, Vandals, Lagwagon are all great bands in their own way, and I'm not trying to take anything away from them.&nbsp; But blink-182's ""Enema of the State"" is probably the most fun album out of them all.&nbsp; Sum 41 tries, but their album ""All Killer, No Filler"" is false advertising.&nbsp; It's almost all filler, trust me.&nbsp; They seemed to be trying to ride on the coattails of blink-182 too much and they just weren't as catchy.&nbsp; Blink-182's songwriting wasn't complex in the least, but it didn't need to be.&nbsp; If you can make short, poppy, catchy songs that rarely get old (listen to ""What's My Age Again?""&nbsp; one more time...it hasn't gotten old).<br /><br />I only made this entry because people think back at blink-182 and they dismiss them for some reason.&nbsp; Well, listen to the shit that's on the radio now.&nbsp; Blink-182 were miles better than them.&nbsp; Where's the fun, where's the explicit, potty-mouth lyrics?&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; Better yet, do any of today's bands have a drummer that is as talented as Travis?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; So fuck off."

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should it be my fault that I never wanted to get involved with somebody in the first place?&nbsp; Should I be to blame for not wanting to participate in certain social activities with a girl who was in need of a social life, desperately?&nbsp; A girl who has only experienced the college life for about one week, has yet gone to a party here, has yet experienced a football game here, and the first guy she meets here at first treats her with much respect, but then shoots her down cold after 3-4 days for no reason?&nbsp; Was there a reason?&nbsp; Is there a reason why I should feel bad?&nbsp; If not, then why do I?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met a girl on Sunday evening.&nbsp; I go to the Big Onion that night because I wanted to watch a college football game (louisville vs. kentucky) because I had (still don't at the moment) no tv in my room.&nbsp; I sit down with some food at my table and start eating.&nbsp; Two tables away, there is a girl sitting all alone and I guess she is staring at me I'm not sure because I'm not really paying attention.&nbsp; She walks over to my table, asks me if I'm eating alone to which I reply ""yes,"" then sits down across from me and introduces herself to me.&nbsp; Already I'm stuck in a situation.&nbsp; She tells me how she has attempted to talk to few other guys at this very place, but then saw them with a group of people, or one guy told her that he was going to meet a girl downtown.&nbsp; Then she came across me.&nbsp; A guy who just wanted to watch tv and eat some food because he has no tv in his room.&nbsp; Not a guy who is lacking in a social life and decided to go back to East Halls (aka Freshmenville) and converse with freshmen girls.&nbsp; However, this is what I am doing and I'm too nice of a guy (*cough*) to say no.&nbsp; So we talk and I really do not have anything to say which has been a problem of mine recently.&nbsp; For some reason I just have nothing to say to people after a five minute conversation.&nbsp; Everything I need to say to someone, I say it, then that's that.&nbsp; But she found ways to fill in moments of awkward silence and I just nodded along.&nbsp; We then went across the commons to talk alone since it was noisy at the Onion.&nbsp; Another to note is that it just happened to be karaoke night at the big onion.&nbsp; If it wasn't for that, I'd have sat down where the big screen tvs were, but I didn't and paid the price.&nbsp; Nevertheless, here I am talking to this girl and she tells me about her family and her personal life.&nbsp; She's new to Penn State and a lot of people, she doesn't know many people around campus.&nbsp; I tell her that it will change over time (and it has so far).&nbsp; We play a couple of games of billiards and then we go back to my place where my roommate is missing.&nbsp; We sit on my bed and talk some more then I get a little nervous because I realize...well I've been contemplating it in my head from when we started walking to my place til when we got there...that things might ""go down""...sexually?&nbsp; Maybe they could've, but for some reason I still don't think so and I'm glad I didn't act on that.&nbsp; I've had sex once before, but it happened so fast that I don't even think it counts.&nbsp; You should be in there for more than 30 seconds in order for it to count, don't you think?&nbsp; Well, nevertheless, I wasn't worried about performance or what it would be like the second time (or the real first time).&nbsp; I just didn't want to do anything remotely sexual with this girl because I was not attracted to her sexually.&nbsp; Regardless of the fact that I've gotten so little sexual attention from the opposite gender, I wasn't going to just act out on that fact by screwing a girl that may have some remote interest in me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, who is to say she even has remote interest in me?&nbsp; Does the fact that I was the first guy willing to talk to her mean that I'm suddenly the main interest in her life?&nbsp; Doubtful, and anyway, she was talking to this guy back home that has been trying to get with her but she didn't make him any promises since she was going away to college and that there were so many guys there.&nbsp; Well, that guy can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that she didn't have sex with the first guy she talked to in State College.&nbsp; Although, that is almost a scary though thinking as how...it COULD'VE happened.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; My utter refusal to do it did have an effect, but what if another guy came on stronger to her?&nbsp; You never know.&nbsp; Interesting to think about.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we buy our books for class together and later that day we take a walk around downtown together.&nbsp; The next day?&nbsp; Classes happened and I had no time to see her.&nbsp; The next day?&nbsp; Alright, here we go...so the next day I just come back from my last class at around 5:30.&nbsp; I'm chilling out in my dorm room when I get a phone call from her and she asks me to come down to the HUB where she will be waiting.&nbsp; I go down to the front of the HUB and she's not there.&nbsp; I call her, she's in the bookstore (right next to the HUB, but nevertheless) with some guy because she needed to get something and she was on her way out.&nbsp; So she comes out with some guy and he's a pre-med major, a sophomore like me, who probably just met this girl that day or the day before and now he thinks he has a shot at her or something.&nbsp; He probably does, he probably did because I haven't talked to her since and I'm not exactly wanting to talking to her.&nbsp; But, not to get ahead, she has nothing planned.&nbsp; Ok, she tells me to walk all the way down to the HUB, I wait there for 5 minutes, and she's with another guy who she didn't mention, and she doesn't know what she wants to do...she had dinner with this guy by the way.&nbsp; I don't know why I should care, but I do.&nbsp; Anyway, for some reason, I'm completely turned off by this situation and to make matters worse this retarded old lady comes up to us and asks us something and we don't know what she is saying...she looks right at me with this weird face and I turn my head in order to avoid laughter.&nbsp; I turn back and I just go ""yeah i'm not sure.""&nbsp; She walks away and this fucking asshole says to me ""you're horrible.""&nbsp; Fuck you, you piece of shit.&nbsp; I'm horrible?&nbsp; I didn't laugh in the woman's face, I just couldn't avoid it so I politely turned away.&nbsp; That makes me horrible?&nbsp; He kinda said it in a joking manner, but fuck that.&nbsp; I don't joke around with people I hardly know.&nbsp; And people who know me, you know I joke around a lot.&nbsp; But that's because I know that I trust those people.&nbsp; When I joke around with you, it's a sign of trust.&nbsp; Feel honored.&nbsp; But I don't joke around and laugh with people I hardly know and I wasn't going to start doing that then.&nbsp; I just said ""yeah, i'm a horrible person right?&nbsp; whatever.""&nbsp; Now, I'm completely turned off, disgusted, angered, and I just want to get the fuck out of there.&nbsp; Who the fuck is this guy, why the fuck am I standing here not doing anything, why the fuck was I asked to come down here in the first place?&nbsp; Then for some reason we start talking about the fact that he lives in West Halls and he has a suite-like room there with posters, decorated.&nbsp; She says ""ok I wanna see your room"" and we just started walking when I say ""you know what, I'm gonna go.""&nbsp; And she was like ""what?""&nbsp; and I said ""i got other plans.""&nbsp; She thought I was bullshitting and I was totally.&nbsp; I walk away and I turn my head a little and she is just standing there, surprised as that pre-med faggot is throwing something away in the garbage.&nbsp; I turn back and start walking back to my dorm and I pick up my phone and pretend to talk in it as I'm walking away because I wanted to make it look like I <u>had other plans</u>.&nbsp; I'm a crafty guy.&nbsp; So I'm walking back and she calls me.&nbsp; I lie and tell her I'm going to visit a friend's apartment, blah blah blah, none of that is true.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't talked her since then...that was Wednesday.&nbsp; I don't feel like talking to her.&nbsp; If she called me, maybe I'd talk to her.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But, like, I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know why I got angry when I saw her walking with another guy.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I wanted to make more of an impression on her before she started meeting other guys?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I just felt like I was getting in a situation I didn't want to be in.&nbsp; I just wanted to be her friend, but I just met this girl and now she wants to me to be friends with her and this other guy.&nbsp; Not to mention that she says things like ""that's why I'm talking to this guy...he's a premed major...he'll be making money"" and then later say ""that's why i like him...he's irish"" (referring to me).&nbsp; What's that about?&nbsp; Am I in competition?&nbsp; I don't want to be in competition.&nbsp; That guy can have her for all I care.&nbsp; I just wish I could've hung out with her a few more times with just me and her because that's the only way I could get comfortable.&nbsp; I don't know...maybe if I knew the other guy or maybe if I knew her better I would be comfortable.&nbsp; I just wasn't comfortable.&nbsp; You could say ""oh you liked her"" whatever, maybe I did.&nbsp; But maybe that has more to do with the fact that hardly any fucking girls out there do like me and when I finally find one that might, she turns out to be somebody that I don't like.&nbsp; Maybe it was all planned this way.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just don't fucking get why this all happened.&nbsp; So I go to the Big Onion, meet this girl, few days later I don't talk to her?&nbsp; Where's the life lesson here?&nbsp; No matter where you go, you'll be fucked?&nbsp; I mean, come on.&nbsp; There was no reason for me even to meet her.&nbsp; It was fucking bullshit.&nbsp; Life is fucking retarded."

but, Texas is still ranked number one in my book.

My TOP 25:

1.&nbsp; Texas
2.&nbsp; Ohio State
3.&nbsp; LSU
4.&nbsp; Auburn
5.&nbsp; USC
6.&nbsp; WVU
7.&nbsp; Oklahoma
8.&nbsp; Florida
9.&nbsp; Norte Dame
10.&nbsp; Louisville
11.&nbsp; Georgia
12.&nbsp; Virginia Tech
13.&nbsp; Penn State
14.&nbsp; Michigan
15.&nbsp; Cal
16.&nbsp; Clemson
17.&nbsp; Oregon
18.&nbsp; Miami
19.&nbsp; Georgia Tech
20.&nbsp; Iowa21.&nbsp; Florida State
22.&nbsp; Boston College
23.&nbsp; TCU
24.&nbsp; Nebraska
25.&nbsp; Boise State

Ohio State is going to be a great team this year and they will most likely kill Penn State this year since they're playing at home.&nbsp; Yeah, it doesn't look good.&nbsp; However, how can we rank them number one when most of their starters on defense are gone?&nbsp; Ohio State has depth, but Texas's defense looks like it might be the best in the nation. This is why I have to give Texas the edge.&nbsp; Sure, they don't have Vince Young anymore, but as long as their offensive line is so good that their rushing attack should be just as, if not more, ferocious as last year's.&nbsp; And, to quote Woody Paige, look at that schedule!&nbsp; They play Ohio State at home.&nbsp; It'll be a close game, but how could you not give Texas the edge?&nbsp; Now, they will play Oklahoma in Normal, OK, but that's the only possible loss on that schedule and personally, I think they'll win that game.&nbsp; Therefore, Texas is number 1 and Ohio State in number 2.&nbsp; Man, the media is overrating Troy Smith.&nbsp; Oh big deal, he lit up NORTE DAME'S defense at the Fiesta Bowl last year....OHHH MAN, Heisman!&nbsp; Give him the Heisman now!&nbsp; GIVE...ME...A....FUCKING...BREAK.&nbsp; He's good, but he's no Vince Young.&nbsp; Troy Smith has Ted Ginn and Antonio Pittman to support him.&nbsp; THAT'S why Ohio State will be good.&nbsp; They have a the whole offensive package, it's not just Troy Smith.&nbsp; Stop overrating him.&nbsp; 

LSU and Auburn can be interchangable really.&nbsp; I'm not sure why I give LSU the edge, but they had a strong team last year that could've gone all the way but they had some disappointing losses.&nbsp; What really turned me on to this team was how they demolished Miami in the Peach Bowl.&nbsp; I think this team will be better this year.&nbsp; We will see which team is better when they play each other in the third week.&nbsp; What has Auburn going this year is their running back Kenny Irons.&nbsp; Man, does this guy have Heisman potential.&nbsp; They lost some starters, but nobody crucial.&nbsp; They have the same team, essentially, as last year and they can only improve.

Finally, USC is USC.&nbsp; Pete Carroll is their coach.&nbsp; They will not have to worry about not having Bush, White, and Leinart.&nbsp; They will win the PAC-10 conference and they'll get to the BCS bowl.&nbsp; What more can you ask for?&nbsp; Why not have them in the top 5?

Overrated:&nbsp; Norte Dame shouldn't be in the fucking top 5 of the polls.&nbsp; Sure, Brady Quinn is a great quarterback and their offense is strong; however, nothing has changed for the better on the defense which was their problem last year.&nbsp; I'm predicting some shoot-outs this year and they have a tough schedule as well.&nbsp; How can they be in the top 5 when they have to play at Georgia Tech (do not write this team off, they are underrated), then they have Penn State and Michigan.&nbsp; Maybe if these games were spread out they'd have a chance, but do you expect them to go 3-0?&nbsp; If they do, then I've overrated Michigan and Penn State because I don't see both of them losing to Norte Dame.&nbsp; Especially since Michigan got embarrassed at home last year versus Norte Dame.&nbsp; I predict Norte Dame will have at least three losses once again this season.&nbsp; Maybe they can come out 10-2 if they manage to beat either PSU or Michigan.&nbsp; They won't beat USC at USC.&nbsp; I don't know how you could have ND in the top 5 when there are obviously at least two potential losses in their schedule and if they choke in the bowl game as usual, they'll wind up with three losses.&nbsp; 9-4 or 10-3 is worthy of top 5?&nbsp; I don't think so...but then again, I wouldn't be surprised considering how much fellatio they receive from the media.

That is all I have to say about that.&nbsp; I'll talk about some other teams at another time.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

I don't know, if I had a kid who didn't come out of his room throughout the day I think I'd check up on him at least once.  Maybe they left for the party at around 2 pm.

"event","I really wanted to bring my car up to State College, but I guess that is out of the question now.  I just dislike the fact that I really don't have any say in my own matters.  If I want to go to State College, PA by myself I should have the right, but am I still too young to make my own decisions?  I feel that I'm not.  I feel like I'm trapped when I live with my parents.  I'm almost 19 years old and yet I feel like dependence is being forced upon.  I have no real options besides co-dependency.  I hate how I can't stand up to my own stepfather.  He takes things too personally that even if I wanted to do so I would regret it in more ways than I can imagine.  It's not fair.  What happens is that he comes up with his own plan :  get tickets to the Akron game.  I tell him if he can get the tickets that I would go.  Fine.  But then he comes up with this plan suddenly to have us all go to State College to drop me off then stay at a hotel room for the night (they would, not me I would hope to assume) then we would go to the game together and they would go home.  Ok.  I guess.  

Here's the thing:  I was never able to get season student tickets because they sold out before I got a chance to pay for them.  I thought I had alternatives, but now I don't.  I am ok with having to watch the game on tv, I take responsibility for my actions, I'm ok with it.  But now I have to pay for my failure of getting those tickets by having to sit with my parents at the football game instead of my fellow student body.  Something tells me that I'm not going to enjoy that.  After spending seven games with the student body celebrating Penn State football, something about doing it on the other side just doesn't sit right with me.  And I want to party the first night of college and have fun, why do I feel like I'd be obligated to spend time with my family while we're up there.  I just don't like this at all really.  Unfortunately, I agreed to it because he was already giving me an attitude for not being 100% enthusiastic about the idea.  Why should I be?  I wanted to take my own car and he knows that.  I'd rather sit in a car for 4-5 hours in silence by myself than with my mom or stepdad.  Trying to come up with a decent conversation to fill in the silence.  Now it'll be all four of us in the car together.  I should've just said that I would rather not go at all.  I should've said that if I'm not with the student body, I don't want to go to the games at all.  But, I didn't.  I know I made a mistake.  And it probably won't turn out to be a big deal, but I really wanted to have fun on my first weekend back in college due to me not having as much fun this summer.  Now, I feel like that's not going to happen.  I just hate when plans are suddenly changed without me.  And there is no way I can try to change them or something because then he'll be offended personally.  Why?  I don't fucking know.  This is what I have to deal with.  I'll say it:  I hate spending time with my immediate family.  I just do.   I've spent too much time with them in the past and it drives me crazy.  I don't hate them, it's just that there are always petty little arguments that drive me insane.  Dorney Park actually turned out all alright, but that's because...well...it was a fluke.

I just feel like my opinion or voice just is NOT getting respected in this household.  I asked if I could drive myself up to college and I just get shut down.  I told them I was willing to pay for the additional costs and they still turn me down.  No, it's still you following our rules, Ken.  You're forever indebted to us because we pay for your college, Ken.  You had nothing to do with getting into Penn State, except for you being smart and all...yeah.  Apparently, I'm not smart enough to make my own decisions.  And this comes from the woman who didn't know what day the college football game would be on.  Saturday.  They're <b>always</b> on a fucking Saturday.  How dumb can you fucking be?  

That is all."

"event","Don't worry, I'll go to sleep right after I write this.  I feel that I should keep writing in the livejournal just for shits and giggles for now on.  That's what I've been doing anyway.  I'll just say whatever I want and if someone reads it, so be it.  I find stuff I said two years ago interesting for some reason.  Maybe two years from now I'll find the stuff I'm saying right now interesting.  Then again, who knows, maybe I'll be in a completely different mindset and find the stuff I'm currently saying actually quite boring and repetitive.  

I was watching episodes of ""Daria"" on youtube.com out of pure discovery and it was actually a really funny show.  The weird thing is that I didn't realize how many of those episodes I had watched when I was younger.  I never considered myself a fan of the show just to somewhat avid follower of it because of its relation to ""Beavis and Butthead.""  It is probably the best spin-off, or one of the best spin-off tv shows ever.  The reason being is because even though it's a spin-off of ""Beavis and Butthead"" they are hardly relative to each other.  Also, they took a semi-interesting character from the original show and made her actually pretty interesting and different on her own spin-off.  It was quite the unique perspective of high school from a not-so-popular girl.  The humorous elements were the exaggerated drawn-out characters surrounding her and no matter how exaggerated some of the character traits are, it's actually probably one of the most realistic high school related shows that have been on tv.  By this, I mean that even though there were exaggerations, the majority of the characters are well drawn-out and at times do display some depth to them.  Yeah, I think it was a pretty good, if underrated tv show.

I have two more days left of work and I have a week and a half vacation before school.  However, it shouldn't be much of a transition.  In fact, if it weren't for the drive it wouldn't seem so daunting as it does.  All I'm doing is going to a different place with fewer adults, more partying, and classes.  I have to study and do homework every now and then and I interact with more people.  I just hope my roommate turns out okay.  Meaning he's not my last roommate.  If he's anything better than my last roommate then he'll be just fine.  I think I might also get a little more involved in school too.  We'll see how it works out.  I gotta make more close friends there.  I don't have any, really.  I have friends, but none of whom I hang out with all the time...just some of the time.  The problem is that a lot of the people already have friends from high school who come to college with them.  I don't know, it probably isn't a problem at all.  It's actually not a big deal, I've just realized how I don't really have that many close friends at college.  This is not to say I don't have any friends...just none of whom I would talk to on a regular basis.  Regular basis meaning practically daily, I would say I talk to friends in college on a weekly basis.  We occasionally hang out and that's that.  There is no constant.  However, I blame it all on my last roommate.  Fuck it.  I say this because everything went fine in the Summer Sessions and then Fall came and I got my new roommate and he just completely made me not want to hang out with anybody.  I don't know what it was, I just hated him and that hate spread.  I regret it, but I can't say I couldn't help it.  I'm hoping this upcoming Fall semester is more successful to me both academically and socially.  My social life in Toms River is fucked up , I don't want my social life in college to be too.  Then again you don't see me actually making a conserted effort to bring up my social life here in TR and maybe that is the difference.

Well, I turned out to have more to say than what I thought I had.

That is all for now."

"event","I don't know what it was, but sitting and waiting for my name to be called at the Seaside Park Municipal Court had to be the most painful experience ever.  I didn't want to be there and I didn't feel I belonged there, especially among some people who had committed worse crimes than I.  I don't believe I went 39 mph on the 25 mph zone in Seaside Park because I was pulled over three blocks away from where I left a friend's house.  For the most part, I was behind a great deal of traffic and therefore couldn't go about 40 mph even if I wanted to (which I wouldn't, obviously).  I had no desire to go above the speed limit, no rush to get somewhere, and although I didn't look at my speedometer all the time, I'm pretty sure I didn't go past 27 mph.  But where's the proof?  I don't have any.  It's like you could be pulled over at any random time at any random moment.  They have that power.  I don't get that.  If I was driving at 39 mph it must have been for a second...tops. I say this because like I aleady mentioned, I was only three blocks away from the house I left.  For two of those blocks, I was behind traffic.  So for what...that one block I was going 39 mph?  The cop was following me for two blocks, I feel that any person with a brain would say ""ok, obviously this guy isn't speeding.""  I feel that I didn't drive far enough to be speeding.  There is no way.  But I can't argue with anybody.  You can't question a policeman's judgment.  You're just fucked.  I plead guilty to an amended charge, but I believe I was innocent.  But who could prove it?  It's unfair, I think I was just an unlucky person.  A cop said ""hmm...who should I pull over today"" which is what Seaside Park/Heights cops do all the time and that day I happened to be the victim.  I hate the police.  I really do.  I can't stand policemen.  I only got helped because my mom had a friend in the police department.  That's all it is.  That's so mob-esque.  You gotta know somebody in order to get off easier.  I never get in trouble for shit like that and it pisses me off when I feel like I was wrongfully summoned for something.  Maybe I'm denial, but I doubt it.  Seriously, I would admit it if I thought I was guilty, but I go over the situation over and over again and it all ends up the same way.  I'm sitting in the municipal court for three hours waiting for my name to be called.  You got people being sent to jail, people from the Ocean County Jail settling court cases via webcam, and people who look like they should be in jail.  Why the fuck am I sitting with these people?  Now, there were a few people who were in the same situation as I was, but nevertheless, I think it's fucked up.  Nobody should be $358 for going 39 mph in a 25 mph zone.  Nobody.  I don't care if points were taken off.  In the long run, it's good, but not if you feel you never did anything wrong in the first place.  I try to stay out of trouble, but what happens?  Trouble finds me.  I'm a victim of my own shitty environment.  I hate everybody."

"event","Unfortunately, my penis and I are at a disagreement.  It likes women.  Oh god, see, this is the type of thing I can't say to the public.  It's good to know nobody reads this.  One day, I'll get famous and somebody will discover this livejournal and will try to destroy me.  You know I will be worried about that when I get famous (which should be within 10 years).  

If it weren't for the fact that the women, in general, are from average to really good-looking, I'd have no use for them.  Maybe I'm being generous by calling the majority of women at least average.  However, I got to consider that I am no Prince William myself.  I seriously will see a woman and think to myself ""eh, she's not so great"" then, I will say ""well, then again, I'm not so great either...I should talk to her.""  Two not so great people coming together like that makes a pretty bland pair, does it not?  Regardless of that, I'm just so fucking tired of the whole game of it all.  Some men are worried about marriage and long-time commitment, if I could just find one woman, just one, I'd be satisfied.  What is this need to have sex with 50 women before we die?  Come on.  One vagina = 50 vaginas, really.  What, finally speaking as a man with a least some experience...I can tell you...I think I get it with the vagina ok?  I've had the experience once, but I think I get it.  Yeah, it's a great journey to the vagina, isn't it?  Oh boy, what a trip.  After the 29th trip, don't you get long-winded?  I just feel that if you don't settle for one, you will always be searching.  You think you got it then, but you don't.  You'll always want something that you don't have.  That's what it is.  And it's psychological, really.  You see your neighbor has a new big-screen plasma tv...you want that.  So then you buy the plasma tv and you see your other neighbor has a bigger plasma tv and you're like ""wow, that's a big tv...i'd rather have that.""  The plus side is that you can put that other plasma tv in your bedroom...but can you really afford two plasma tvs?  Wait, what are we talking about here?  Women.  Oh, ok.  

I'm not trying to compare women to plasma TVs (they can't be fixed as easily).  However, I think my general idea could get across by that analogy...if that's actually an analogy.  But nevertheless, what I'm trying to say is that the drive to be with other women is just that...a drive.  And I understand it because I see that drive.  I have that very same drive.  I'm attracted to all types of women and there's no doubt that I still would be even if the ""right"" woman came along.  So am I going to dump one girlfriend because another girl who has taken an attraction to me has bigger breasts?  So then I'm with this big-breasted woman when suddenly another woman comes along in my life who is...I don't know...easier to get to bed with?  The question is, what am I really looking for here?  Is there some be all end all woman that will satisfy my every need and make me unattracted to every other woman in the world?  Of course not. 

So what's the point?  The point is that this is too much for me.  I don't know anymore.  I've tried, I guess.  I probably didn't try hard enough, I don't try hard enough and I know so.  I try to impress and I fail.  I try the opposite and I fail as well.  Of course I would.  So what the fuck am I doing?  It's like I'm on stage trying to tell jokes and I'm bombing ever second.  I can't get off stage yet so I have to just stand there and take it.  Why am I doing this to myself, I wonder.  There's no real logical answer I can give myself because I don't really know an answer.  I see a guy with somebody and I say ""it's not that hard, it can't be if he's with someone.""  Fuck that, he got lucky.  That's all it is, it's luck.  I mean, let's face it.  How do men end up with women at the end of most romance movies?  Pure fucking luck.  Think about it.  The woman forgives him.  Why?  The woman decides not to get on that plane, or the men gets off the plane to find the woman waiting there.  Why?  A woman breaks a man's heart only to have that man find someone else...how?  By pure coincidence, by fate.  That's all it is.  So you meet a girl that you have a lot in common with, you share interests with and she seems to be pretty interested in you.  You ask her, she says ""yes.""  Suddenly, you're going out for months and you give her an engagement ring, you get married, you have two children.  It sounds great, but do you feel great?  No, it's your sixth year of marriage and the wife is nagging you.  She wants you to fix that sink.  You don't shit about fixing sinks, you're not a plumber.  The kids are crying about something.  You didn't change that diaper, or you weren't doing this.  It's a hassle.  It's not picture perfect, it's not what you dreamed of this type of life to be.  So, one night you go out drinking at a bar and you meet a woman who is going through a tough divorce.  She tells you that she was unhappy with her man and you tell her that you're unhappy with the woman you're with.  The woman tells you that she hasn't been with another man for years and you haven't been with another woman for years.  Is this leading to something?  Adultery?  But you have a wife and kids, why would you do that?  You're not thinking that, you're home situation sucks to you.  So you have sex with this woman you met at a bar, come home, deal with the same shit.  You say to yourself ""that woman I just fucked...I gotta see her again.""  You start seeing this other woman and the wife finds out, wants a divorce.  Split custody of kids.  You start seeing this other woman in the meantime and you think you got something going here.  A couple months go by and you get married to this woman.  You see your kids, or you try to, meanwhile, you try to start another family with this woman.  You have another kid or two, things seem great.  Then the same problems arrive, little problems.  Right?  This doesn't happen to everyone, but think about how high the divorce rate is in this country.  Is it because of the generation?  No.  All men would divorce their wives 200 years ago, they just didn't think they could.  Now that they can, they do it all time.   And this isn't to judge men.  This is to show that it happens all the time.  But why?  Because there's a hunt.  A search out there for this ideal woman in an ideal situation where everything is perfect.  You're 48 years old, you are to enter your third divorce, you have six kids.  For some people it takes that long to realize that they aren't going to find that perfect person so they finally settle down with someone.  And they live it out that way.  That's how it goes.  I think.  That's how I'm perceiving it.  I think.  I'm not sure about anything actually.  Let's just assume it's like that because it makes my point valid.  So is it luck?  It's twisted luck.  Why does one lead to another?  Why did that man marry that woman only to get divorced and marry another?  Wasn't the first ""the one""?  Wasn't that fate?  Wasn't that love?  What happened?  How did he wind up with that woman?  It was luck.  But good luck?  That's up for debate.  Oh fuck all this, it's too hard.

<div align=""center""><font size=""1""><em><a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0205000/"">""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</a> star <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0001705/"">Rob Schneider</a> is the first actor to publicly announce he will never work with <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0000154/"">Mel Gibson</a> due to the anti-Semitic remarks he made when he was arrested last Friday. Schneider took out an ad in Hollywood trade paper Variety slamming the star for his behavior in ""An Open Letter to the Hollywood Community."" The ad appeared yesterday and said, ""I, <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0001705/"">Rob Schneider</a>, a 1/2 Jew, pledge from this day forth to never work with Mel Gibson-actor-director-producer-and anti-Semite."" Schneider then went on to say even if he were offered the lead role in </em><em>Passion Of The Christ 2 or a ""juicy voice-over role in his new flick <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0472043/"">Apocalypto</a> and spoke ancient Mayan"" he would still turn them down. He also repeatedly praised Hollywood talent manager <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0109401/"">Bernie Brillstein</a> for publicly saying he would refuse to work with Gibson because ""I just don't like bigots."" The actor continued by saying he had recently directed a film called <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0490086/"">Big Stan</a> in which there was a part for a Nazi gang leader ""which apparently Mel would be perfect for."" Schneider said he would still not cast Gibson in that role and ended the letter by saying, ""Of course that would only be after I talked with my financial backers. Some of whom share Mr. Gibson's hankering for a good bottle of tequila. Because, after all...I don't get to call all the shots.""<br /><br /></em></font>
<div align=""left"">Yes, ROB SCHNEIDER.&nbsp; Thank you for this.&nbsp; We need more mediocre actors to vow never to work with Mel Gibson.&nbsp; Now, I hope Rob Schneider was going a little tongue-in-cheek knowing that everybody thinks he's a fucking horrible comedian/actor and is laughing about this.&nbsp; He's fucking slippin', fallin', can't get up like what DMX (dark man unknown for those not in the NOW) said.&nbsp; Now, fucky wuckies...what's the point of this?&nbsp; My point is that it seems to me that Rob Schneider is taking Mel Gibson's public, stupid drunkenness and using it to gain respect to the Jewish community or get more people to pay attention to him.&nbsp; In other words, he just wants attention.&nbsp; Because who the fuck cares what Rob Schneider thinks?&nbsp; So what if he's half-Jewish?&nbsp; Let Spielberg vow never to work with Gibson.&nbsp; Not you.&nbsp; Why would you make this public anyway?&nbsp; Who are you trying to prove?&nbsp; I just told Mel Gibson to rot in hell publicly...I never said I would never work with him.&nbsp; I wouldn't take out an ad in the paper in order to say that because who gives a shit what I think?&nbsp; Who gives a shit what Rob Schneider thinks?&nbsp; Nobody.&nbsp; You're starving for attention and also you're not taking this seriously, obviously.&nbsp; Mel Gibson is an anti-semite bigot who deserves to...<br /><br />WAIT WOO WOO WHAT JOO JOO BEANS FUCK DILLHOLE HOLD ON A SECOND<br /><br />What does Mel Gibson deserve?&nbsp; Ok, I don't like the fact that Mel Gibson said what he said and I hope he burns in hell for what he said.&nbsp; However, this country is about freedom of speech and sure he'll probably won't get a Hollywood role now that he fucked up and he shouldn't have said it.&nbsp; But this is being blown too much out of proportion.&nbsp; In America, you have the freedom to say whatever you want as long as it's not ""fire"" in a movie theater.&nbsp; Mel Gibson, no matter of how you view his opinion, is allowed to have that opinion.&nbsp; And I think we should not stoop to his level of bigotry by vowing not to work with him publicly.&nbsp; A.&nbsp; because it's people like Rob Schneider saying it and nobody gives a shit about him&nbsp; B.&nbsp; because you're basically spewing the same type of hate that Mel Gibson is spewing.&nbsp; You're spreading more hate around and you shouldn't do that.&nbsp; Tell Gibby to burn in hell and that's it.&nbsp; There's nothing else to say in the matter.&nbsp; He fucked up, he's a bigot anti-semite and that's that.&nbsp; Leave it at that.<br /><br /><strong>2.&nbsp; </strong>welllllllllllllllllllllll&nbsp; I checked my new roommate's facebook again because he messaged me and he changed his information.&nbsp; He took out a lot of references to God...weird right?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder why he did that.&nbsp; Does he know about me?&nbsp; What the fuck, that's weird is it not?&nbsp; Does anybody else think that's weird?&nbsp; The fact that I mentioned that he had all these God references in his profile and now that I've mentioned it...he doesn't?&nbsp; And he left me a message basically introducing himself and everything...so whoa, right?&nbsp; I just thought that was weird.&nbsp; Are you reading this right now Joe?&nbsp; What the fuck man?&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp; </div>

"event","My infatuation with the band Yeah Yeah Yeahs and their lead singer Karen O has grown over the past few years.&nbsp; At first I dismissed them as merely being a part of the fad of garage rock without even hearing them.&nbsp; However, ""Fever to Tell"" turns out to be the album I listened to the most throughout my senior year.&nbsp; It helps that it's raw, fast, and less than 40 minutes long.&nbsp; What fascinated me about the album was how Karen O turned from an all-out raunchy, sex-filled girl into a more vulnerable, human, introspective woman.&nbsp; While she never loses her swagger, she essentially pours her heart out in the album and it becomes something more than a stylistic, fast-paced rock album.&nbsp; The last three songs off ""Fever to Tell"" is what makes the album complete.&nbsp; While some may not like the fact that the slower, ballad-like songs are at the end, I think that's the genius of it.&nbsp; It doesn't work on all albums, but an album like this it does.&nbsp; I think the rawness of the first 6-7 songs wouldn't feel so powerful if they were split up by slower ballads.&nbsp; I think it's better to kind of split the album into two.&nbsp; 

YYY's latest album ""Show Your Bones"" picks off where the end of ""Fever to Tell"" left off.&nbsp; It's more emotional and while I was a little taken aback by how lackluster in energy it was compared to their first album, I've grown to love the album the more I listen to it.&nbsp; It's a grower.&nbsp; And it just might have proven to me that Karen O is one of the greatest frontwomen in the history of rock n roll.&nbsp; We'll see, of course.&nbsp; It's pretty hard to beat Debbie Harry.&nbsp; Debbie Harry was sexy and had a great voice, Pat Benatar had a lot of attitude and was also sexy.&nbsp; Karen O has a great voice, attitude, she's definitely more sexual than them, and she also has the ability to swing from raunchiness to vulnerability and never making it sound forced or out-of-place.&nbsp; She's also hot as hell.&nbsp; While her beauty may not stand out when you see her at first, it's when you see her on stage.&nbsp; She certainly has the greatest stage presence out of any other woman I've ever seen.&nbsp; This is not to put her bandmates in the shadows.&nbsp; But, let's face it, Yeah Yeah Yeahs main focus is Karen O.&nbsp; She could never be replaced.&nbsp; The other two band members are great at what they do and they definitely complement Karen very well.&nbsp; Nevertheless,&nbsp; this band has the ability to make more great albums and hopefully they could more seamlessly capture their rawness and softness in the future.&nbsp; It would seem more like a retreat if they went back to their earlier sound.&nbsp; The only step they can make now is to expand on their previous two records.&nbsp; As for Karen O, she's unpredictable.&nbsp; She has the ability to surprise and hypnotize.&nbsp; I have a feeling that this band, or at least Karen O will stick around for quite awhile."

"event","What emo is today and what Mineral started over 10 years ago are two totally different things.&nbsp; While Mineral didn't start the movement of emo, they definitely best exemplify what it's supposed to be all about...emotion.

You see, Mineral did it right.&nbsp; Many other bands did it right, but Mineral did it best.&nbsp; They created an atmosphere that allowed the lyrics to not sound cheesy and to make it sound powerful.&nbsp; Their music built up to a climax like our emotions do.&nbsp; Whining isn't an emotion.&nbsp; Sadness and happiness don't just happen, they build.&nbsp; And not many bands over the past 20 years put that to music better than Mineral.&nbsp; This is why I have a problem with bands like Taking Back Sunday.&nbsp; They don't bring out any true emotion.&nbsp; There's just a bunch of screaming and nonsense.&nbsp; This genre of music has become so formulaic and repetitive that many people forget what it was all about in the first place...emotion.&nbsp; All music has emotion, but bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate, and early Death Cab For Cutie all brought out emotion in an atmospheric way.&nbsp; It's the sound, the intensity, the climax, the lyrics that weren't just about heartache but about feelings.&nbsp; But about feelings of happiness and sadness themselves.&nbsp; Sure you can sing about love lost, unrequited love, broken heart...but you don't have to whine about it.&nbsp; Nobody likes a crybaby.&nbsp; Don't cry about love lost, reflect on it.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; That's what Mineral did.&nbsp; I wish more people would see it that way and realize that that's what ""emo"" is truly about.&nbsp; It's not about the clothes, your look...a sad face doesn't mean you're depressed.&nbsp; There's more to emotion than that, don't forget it.&nbsp; And goddamnit, stop being so miserable.&nbsp; It is possible to write about happiness too."

Someone told me that SWR was dark as hell.&nbsp; They may be graphic, but not dark.&nbsp; Singing a song about killing someone isn't dark.&nbsp; Singing a song about killing someone while laughing about it...that's dark.&nbsp; Big difference.&nbsp; ""I stuck a knife in his neck"" is just violent, not dark.&nbsp; It's like saying all violent movies are dark, Pulp Fiction isn't dark.&nbsp; The Shining is dark.&nbsp; Get my drift.&nbsp; I know some may scoff at what I say here, but I don't think having an opinion about something is pretentious.&nbsp; I can enjoy simple music if it has a good melody and it's fun to listen to.&nbsp; But a band trying to be goth...that's different to me.&nbsp; Maybe goth in the sense that those kids in the mall are goth, but it's nothing deeper than that.&nbsp; It's superficial.&nbsp; Everyone is different though.&nbsp; I don't care if you like SWR, but just know that I really hate them.&nbsp; Ok?&nbsp; Doesn't make me pretentious.&nbsp; Listing my top 100 albums of the 80s...THAT'S pretentious.&nbsp; Calling out She Wants Revenge?&nbsp; Notsomuch.&nbsp; &nbsp;"

"event","I only wish I never limited myself toward listening to one genre of music for a good part of my life.&nbsp; Over the past few years, I have found the good parts about hip hop, jazz, country, soul, funk, pop, etc...&nbsp; I think every genre has its bad and its good.&nbsp; I think that a lot of rock fans get disoriented over rap because they hear Nelly or Puff Daddy both of whom have dominated the airwaves over the past few years.&nbsp; However, that's like judging rock music because of Creed.&nbsp; There's so much more there.&nbsp; Why dismiss metal because of Papa Roach?&nbsp; You know?&nbsp; Every classification of music has its high points and low points.&nbsp; I think it's silly to dismiss something entirely because of a shit band/group you heard once on the radio.&nbsp; Once you fully immerse yourself into it, you will realize that there are some really good shit that you're missing.&nbsp; Country, for example, all the shit that's been released in the past 20 years hasn't been too good, but you listen to the old school Country music like Johnny Cash...there is good country.&nbsp; And there is Alternative Country which has less of that slide guitar which, I think, is what throws me off.&nbsp; That and the distinctive Southern accent.&nbsp; Somebody like Whiskeytown came around in the late 90s and were basically all about Country, but because Ryan Adams had a different type of voice...a very smooth, rock-like voice and he wrote meaningful, poignant lyrics...it really showed me a new way of making that kind of music.&nbsp; Same thing with blues and jazz.&nbsp; Although, Jazz I do have a hard time with even though I do enjoy it.&nbsp; I just can only enjoy it in small doses; however, Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" is a fantastic record.&nbsp; Well, fuck.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Even soul.&nbsp; I like soul.&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; I like Marvin Gaye.&nbsp; I'm not ashamed of it and I don't think anybody should.&nbsp; I'd like to make a compilation cd of Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, Johnny Cash, Public Enemy, Slayer, Sonic Youth, Michael Jackson, Funkadelic, and Fatboy Slim combined.&nbsp; It's all music.&nbsp; All music is enjoyable.&nbsp; Why limit yourself?&nbsp; There's so much out there?&nbsp; Why corner your musical tastes?&nbsp; I think that we only use 10% of our brain voluntarily.&nbsp; I think we can be open to other things if we tried to.&nbsp; There are things I've tried liking and didn't pan out, there are some thing that rubbed me the wrong way (Creed) from the beginning and I never wound up enjoying it.&nbsp; Some bands repulse me, some bands take me awhile to get into, some I love the first time I hear them.&nbsp; It all depends.&nbsp; I'm not saying I'm special because I am able to listen to Nas, Motorhead, Guns N Roses, and Rage Against the Machine interchangably...then add some Beatles and Sex Pistols in there...whatever.&nbsp; It may not be your bag.&nbsp; But don't dismiss it without opening up.&nbsp; ""I tried listening to Illmatic and I couldn't understand anything so I turned it off.""&nbsp; Yeah, ok.&nbsp; 

I'm starting to resent fashion being synonomous with music.&nbsp; You think of a band, you think of the fashion.&nbsp; I don't have to wear a Roc-A-Wear shirt in order to buy a Jay-Z album as I don't need to wear dark-rimmed glasses in order to appreciate (one of the better) emo bands.&nbsp; I think it's ok to follow a trend, as long as you are aware that it's a trend.&nbsp; However, I scoff at the idea of my fashion not being suitable enough for the type of music I listen to.&nbsp; I don't look like a guy who would like heavy metal?&nbsp; Because I don't wear a shirt with a heavy metal band on it?&nbsp; I don't think I need to express my tastes by merchandise except for cds.&nbsp; I do own shirts with band names on it, but I'd only wear it out of tribute or respect.&nbsp; Not because I want people to think I'm cool for listening to them.&nbsp; I just think Black Flag needs to be paid attention to sometimes.&nbsp; My point is that I'll wear what I want.&nbsp; And I do care about what people think sometimes so I won't go out of my way to dress like a jackass.&nbsp; I don't like drawing attention to myself.&nbsp; I don't like that unless I'm trying to make a statement which I rarely am.&nbsp; My statement is ""I'll wear whatever the fuck I want.""&nbsp; 

God I'm so cool.&nbsp; If I was ever in a band, I would encourage my fans not to buy the clothes that I wear because I'm wearing them.&nbsp; And I would only sell self-promoting merchandise at shows or something like that.&nbsp; I don't want some corporation handling my shit.&nbsp; If you like my band, you wanna wear a shirt that says so, come to a show.&nbsp; Or, order it exclusively off my website.&nbsp; I want ALL profit.&nbsp; MONEY IS GOD.&nbsp; Hahahahahahaha.&nbsp; And on that note, I'll end this here.&nbsp; Anyway, I hope all my points have been made."

None of that compares to the incredibly irritating monotone voice of the She Wants Revenge's lead singer.&nbsp; Dear god.&nbsp; What the fuck is the deal here?&nbsp; So, it's ok to rip off another band as long as you wait 20 years?&nbsp; It's not that they've been inspired by Joy Division, it's that they've completely ripped them off.&nbsp; From the beats to the Ian Curtis wannabe...the only difference is that Ian Curtis was legitimately depressed and suffered from epilepsy and he hated himself AND he was a fantastic songwriter.&nbsp; These guys (She Wants Revenge) do not have an ounce of creativity, originality, or ingenuity in their bones.&nbsp; One main difference is that while Joy Division's strength was Ian Curtis's highly literate and imaginative lyrics...She Wants Revenge seriously lacks that.&nbsp; Why settle for the imitators?&nbsp; If you seriously like She Wants Revenge, check out Joy Division and you'll feel like a fool.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but I'm just tired of the Joy Division imitators.&nbsp; I think the Editors, She Wants Revenge, The Killers (to some extent), and Interpol seriously owe their success to Joy Division and especially Ian Curtis.&nbsp; At least Interpol isn't a total ripoff, they actually know how to write good songs.&nbsp; The others?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I don't mean to rag on the fans of these bands, you can like them.&nbsp; But, dear god, She Wants Revenge is terrible.&nbsp; 

I'm not just ragging on mainstream radio, it's just that most of it is bad.&nbsp; Almost all of it is bad.&nbsp; I would tell you when I think it's good.&nbsp; I like Franz Ferdinand, I supported Modest Mouse when they crossed over, I just get offended when I hear bands ripping off artists who perfected that sound over 25 years ago.&nbsp; Imitation may be the high form of flattery, but it's also annoying and unoriginal.&nbsp;"

It is without a doubt, still, the greatest album I've ever heard.&nbsp; Keep in mind, I've listened to Revolver, Pet Sounds, Zeppelin's IV, all that shit man.&nbsp; I've heard all the classics.&nbsp; London Calling goes from one style to the other effortlessly.&nbsp; From rock to reggae to rockabilly to...anything you can think of....they cover it all in this record.&nbsp; If you don't like any of these songs, there is something wrong with you.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what you're a fan of, there is no denying the power of Joe Strummer's voice.&nbsp; It's not just the songwriting, the production is excellent too.&nbsp; The sound is full, every square inch covered with music.&nbsp; The sequence is perfect even with sticking the love song (or anti-love song) at the end.&nbsp; It's ingenius.&nbsp; Some bands have filler tracks on albums that only have about 10 or 11 songs, but London Calling has 18 brilliant tracks.&nbsp; It is perfection.&nbsp; It is the culmination of what is great about music and if you can't like, appreciate, or understand that, then there is something wrong with you.&nbsp; This album is important.&nbsp; It influenced so many with its message, its music, its diversity, its willingness to try anything.&nbsp; On top of all that, there are just great songs on here.&nbsp; The reason why the reggae/dub songs work so well with the straight-ahead rock or punk songs is because they're all...genuinely great songs.&nbsp; They're not just trying it for the hell of it, they've perfected every style they've tried.&nbsp; They were virtuosos.&nbsp; And they released the amazing failure of Sandinista! a year later.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; That's ridiculous.&nbsp; How do you top a 2 LP album?&nbsp; A 3 LP album.&nbsp; Is it better than London Calling?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; But its ambition, the willingness to take their music to the next step, to try anything makes Sandinista! so great and underappreciated.&nbsp; It's such a sprawling, long album.&nbsp; But after repeated listenings, it's a rewarding record.

Maybe releasing 4 great albums in a row containing over 100 songs wasn't such a great idea as far as durability goes.&nbsp; They could've just released a bunch of 8-10 song albums year after year and last much longer.&nbsp; But that would be missing the point, I guess.&nbsp; Listen to the album.&nbsp; If you hate it, you're stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple as that."

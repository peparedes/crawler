"event","I bought a single, red rose today at Kroger of all places. $2.99 plus tax. The little old man in front of me gave me a sorrowful, poignant look and let me go ahead of him in line. It was just for my re-telling of Beauty and the Beast in my Children's Literature class. They probably thought I was getting it for a friend, or being melancholy and cheering myself up. Turns out that I was the one that was wrong. It has cheered me up. I've been carrying around a crimson rose all day, for no reason other than necessity and for some silly reason I've loved doing so."

"event","Today is one of those sharp, bright, yet cold days. Driving home around noon, I saw a man walking down the side of the street. The street was one that led out of town, no where near the city or even the college. He was well-dressed with navy trousers, camel blazer, dress shoes, his hair a salt and pepper gray. His easy walk was accented by his hands being leisurely tucked into his pockets.  He didn't look from side to side, or even at my car as I turned just past him. He looked straight ahead, almost at the horizon above the trees. He was out of place in that setting with those clothes, walking down the street to nowhere. Yet, at the same time, the casual determination in his walk made him the perfect compliment to the picture. He wasn't an overdressed hiker heading into the mountains, neither was he a businessmen who's car had broke down. Just a man taking a walk on a clear, Sunday morning, nothing in his pockets but his hands and nothing in his mind but his thoughts."

"event","I love it when an old song that meant something else at one point in your life takes on a new meaning when heard under a different light. It's like hearing it for the first time. There are some songs that attach themselves to your life. You hear it and it takes you back to a moment, a smell, a touch. And hopefully, if the song rings true enough, it can shed the old meaning like a skin and find a new place in your memory."

"event","So it's odd, I realize, but I get along much better with my mom when I'm not at home. If I have to E-mail her, or even call her, for some reason I can actually say what I want to say instead of just sitting and talking to her face-to-face. That being said, an E-mail I sent to her a few days ago was blunt, to say the least, but probably the most honest I have been with her in awhile. It's a unique place to be when you're 21 and telling your 52 year old mother what she needs to do with the remainder of her life now that her children are basically on their own. I look up to my mom in many ways, mostly for how she didn't let her emotionally empty upbringing effect her treatment of her children (I don't remember a day when she didn't tell me she loved me --something I took for granted...). I also greatly respect, as I look back now, her choice in not sending us to public school and her encouragement for me to go to Hillsdale. She changed from her life and I want to change from mine. There's a book called An American Tragedy, and loosely it's about this man who shakes off his old life because he knows he sees something else for himself. I never thought I could relate to that, but as of late, the concept is becoming familiar to me. My family, extended as well as nuclear, is a series of heartbreaks, bad decisions, tragic endings, unhappy marriages, and unfulfilled dreams. Of course all families have those things to some extent, but I'm glad to say that I recognize that I want something different for myself. I may not know what direction I am going, but there will be a direction, just like I will have the life that I want. Never thought that I would say it, but I think that my mom had a lot to do with it."

I picked up the next magazine and it said ""Sex Tips He Wants You to Know"". Does he really want you to know? The next magazine said ""The Only Books You Need to Read"". There are only ten I need to read? Best movies of all time? ""This is the List to Top all Other Lists"". There is so much to know out there, but are we supposed to know it all? It's impossible. I always have this insatiable urge to sit there and actually read all the magazines I come across. ""The Secret to a Happy Career"". ""How to Retire at Forty"". ""Best Travel Locations"". ""How to Invest and Reap the Benefits Before You're 25"". ""What You Really Want in Bed""... the possibilities are endless. But do we really want to know it all? I read in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" that we should leave some things to be unknown. I don't want to know how men think. I have enough trouble knowing how I think. I don't want to know about the exotic locations from National Geographic that I'm never going to have the time to travel to. I know I want to go to Ireland. I don't want to know what the ""new black"" is. I like the old black just fine. Maybe I don't want to know why the sky is blue? I find it one of the most beautiful sights already. Honestly, the things we don't know are endless. What I'm struggling with is trying to find the few things I want to know. I want to know a few things well, but what are those things?"

"event","Now for a realistic post on what's new with me.

There's the class schedule. No english (shocking), but I'm enjoying what I have so far: Biology, American Art, American Religion (I'm an American girl, what can I say?), Children's Literature, Bowling and possibly Pilates. That Lit. class is going to be a lot of work... reason #500 that I am not an Education major is that the work is inane and pointless, teaching me no skills for future usage. That aside, I like reading Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss. 

My office is going well but that's only because I haven't actually sat down and gone through the papers. It's going to be a lot of work, but I need the responsibility (not to mention, it's amazing on a resume to say you're a Vice President of anything...). Speaking of resumes, I randomly applied to a company in Chicago the night I left home, and I've since had a phone interview which has now lead to a live video conference next Wednesday for the company. I guess they're coming out to interview myself and another girl from Hillsdale. I want the job so badly! It's perfect: just outside of Chicago, paid room and board, and $12.50/hour. Ohhh, I can't think about it... and another wierd sidenote of today, I got an invitation to the Lamplighters Junior Tea. Me? If they only knew ;).

I'm also still working at the library, but I cut back to 8 hours. And as of now, I'm still going to do the movie reviews... I just hope I'm not biting off more than I can chew. If I sit there and think about it all, I stress out, but when it comes down to it, I think I can handle it. I'm also hoping to pick-up a little this year. We'll see what happens.

And then there's this guy... :)"

"event","I remember the first time I told my mom that I had drank at college. It took me 35 minutes to squeeze the words out of my parched throat, and it took me 35 minutes to peel my shaking, clamy hands off the side off the seatbelt and fold them in my lap. But, I said them. And she was quiet for a moment. I waited. The actions were no longer little shameful memories in my heart, but they were floating in the air, and sinking into her mind. I waited still, and tears stung the back of my eyes. That familiar, pure sense of guilt weighed on me. A knowing, yet amused look came on her face. It's college everyone does things like that what did you drink You didn't drive did you?

I wanted her to say that it was wrong. Or even to say that it was perfectly right. She did neither. I knew in that moment that I had to decide for myself. And now, I can't remember the last time I felt guilt. When did I become so complacent?"

"event","Say you had a favorite pair of tennis shoes when you were young. They were comfortable and because you wore them almost every day, they were contoured to your foot. They took you to the places you wanted to go to see the people you wanted to see to talk about the things you wanted to talk about. Well, as the years rolled by, your tastes changed. The broken-in tennis shoes just weren't what you needed. You found a pair of leather, high-heeled boots with a tapered toe that fit your foot. At first, it hurt to walk in them, but with each time you slipped them on they conformed to the shape of your feet. Pretty soon, those boots took you on to different paths with different surfaces, to different places with different people. Those old tennis shoes are still in the back of your closet under some old sweatshirts. You know they still might slid on your feet, but there's no reason to put them back on. They don't go with the clothes you want to wear, neither are they appropriate for the places you want to go. They remind you of the person you once were with the persons you were once surrounded by, on a surface you no longer recognize."

Sure, I'm working a few days here and there, and I did get my shopping started and finished today, but now (before I wrote this and after I'm done typing this) I'm reading an essay by Virginia Woolf which is completely engrossing to me. My mom turned to me from wrapping presents and asked if that was for school. I told her surprised face 'no, just because' and she kind of chuckled. I haven't even gotten to the ""meat"" of it yet, but it doesn't matter because some of the passages are breathtaking. I wish I had the wherewithall during the school year to appreciate the things I read... being able to read again, on my own, makes me feel like myself.

"event","My mom E-mailed me today to let me know that a family friend of ours died over the weekend. Normally, I wouldn't be so bothered by it, but this person was engrained into my childhood. We were told that she had breast cancer a few months ago, but I had no idea it was so advanced. She lived across the street from the house I lived in from the ages of three till about eleven. She'd babysit for us or my mom would babysit for her two youngest boys when she couldn't make it. I remember almost drowning in their pond one day when my mom and I were over there, until they both ran into the water and pulled me out. When they went on vacations, we'd take care of their dog, and I also remember getting my first invitation to her son Randy's sixth birthday party in the mail. Everything we did was somehow linked to these people. My most vivid memory is of when my mom would go over for coffee. The minute I got in the door, I ran through their living room, down the hallway and climbed up on her bed to play with the little doll she had sitting near the pillows. I don't know why, but I adored that doll. A few years later, she sent a bag over to our house and on the top of it was the doll. She knew I loved it. When her sons grew too old to be babysat, they started babysitting us. I remember many hot afternoons playing catch with Joey and my brothers out in the front lawn. Times changed and we ended up moving a few towns away, but we still kept in contact. I'd see her in the grocery store or at softball games and I'd say 'hello'. I have no idea if she even remembers that doll she gave me or if she realizes that she was such a part of our lives, but she was. The hardest part is trying to realize that that person is gone. Someone that you took for granted--one of those faces from the past that played a seemingly small part in your life. It turns out that it was much bigger."

I drove a lot this week and it was a much needed break. Maybe I didn't do as much thinking as I should have, but it's hard to not have the radio blaring as you meander through the beautiful autumn Michigan country. I have been seeing the same road for a long time, hypothetically and literally, so my excursion to Temperance to see Jodi was a pleasant break. I took the backroads (using her written out directions) and I was in awe of there being such breathtaking scenery so close to Hillsdale. If you can, have some take you out towards E.Bacon Rd (you won't regret it). It was well worth the trip there :). I had a great time meeting and partying with my amazing Big and her friends from Toledo (I highly recommend Bootleggers to anyone looking for a club). The next morning I somehow made my way out to I-75 (insane stretch of freeway) and with the help of some Arab guy at a Red Roof Inn, I got to Silverwood a few hours later. It's funny to note that on the way to Toledo and through Detroit the next day, I had no idea which roads to take, just the little MI map in my hands and I also had limited cash with me as well as no cellphone. That 3 hour drive was so much more refreshing than the drive back to Hillsdale from my hometown, a drive on which I knew where I was going, had cash, and a cellphone. The not knowing and the element of risk are the things that make life worth living. Anyway, last semester I rarely went home, but I'm finding that it's really liberating to not make set plans and just say ""what the heck? I'll go home for the night."" So I did. And it was good to see my family (we went to dinner and a movie), but I was disappointed when I went to my brother Zack's room and saw that it was empty. I know he's in college, but seeing his room empty and not being able to burst in and talk to him was disheartening. Life is happening fast. Nevertheless, I got to see my family, and headed out the next day, did a little shopping on the way, and got back to Hillsdale by 3 or so. Homework didn't happen like I had planned, but did some cleaning and arranging, watched movies, got dinner with DeAnna and Caity, and then went to the Suites with Gray and Cindy to hang out with Carlos, Luke, and Kelly. It was a goodtime, and now I'm sad to get back into the old routine, but I'm glad to have had a break..."

"event","Have you ever wished that you could see yourself from someone else's view? Like step outside of your body, and actually watch yourself. Watch everything--the way you walk, how you stand when you talk with people, how your clothes look (and if they look like you perceive them), how you eat, what you look like when you are nodding off in class, how you look when you're booking it up the hill, how you look standing in Saga with your tray looking for people to sit with, how you look dancing, or even seeing how you look when you smile? I probably don't want to know what I look like, in all actuality, but it's just one of those things that crosses my mind from time to time. And now you're thinking ""Rachel, this is a lame post, so just give up now and go to bed!"".

It's something that I don't find with people from home, and it's something they would never understand. We all make mistakes, but we are all there to laugh at them afterwards :).

"event","I'm amazed by how often people beat around the bush to get what they're after (I am not exempt). While watching my brother's football game on Saturday, I couldn't help but be enthralled by the tiny but intricate interactions I could see in front of me (sadly more interesting than the game). The high schoolers in the stands were human nature on display. There was the short blonde girl sitting next to a boy with braces, though she wasn't sitting by him because she liked him. She would glance over at the tan, blonde guy (who was looking at the tall, thin, brunettes strutting past the stands in front of him) just beyond the other boy each time she'd toss her hair back. As she twirled her hair around her fingers and snapped her gum, a lanky brown-headed boy climbed up and sat in front of her and her friend. He would turn and make conversation with the guy in the middle, obviously his friend. When the girl was futiley straining to look at the blonde boy, the lanky boy in front of her would catch a glimpse of her out of the corner of his eye. She never saw it. And she probably never will. The blonde boy she's looking at may never know that she's looking at him, and the seemingly oblivious one sitting in the middle may know all of it and be jealous, but there's nothing he can do. In between those ""lines"" is so much thought and emotion that the ""other guy"" will never witness. How many times do we pull ourselves into situations that aren't what we really want in vain attempts at getting what we think we need? Even more, how many times do we ignore what's right in front of us?

I did actually watch my brother's game, p.s. They lost, but I was still proud of how well he did :). The weekend: I think it was pretty good."

Now, I'm stuck in a rut. Usually this doesn't happen until the second week of September, and then it doesn't appear again until second semester (the second semester blues, as I call them). But now it's hitting me... it's never one thing, just a lot of little things. As usual, the smallness of Hillsdale gets to me. There are times when it seems hopeful, and other days, it's not. I get into my routine, and little there is to pull me back out. I don't know if its the social scene which holds little variance, or if it's just how I look at things, but I need to change something."

"event","I tried practicing the piano yesterday afternoon. You would never have known that I've been playing since I was seven, and that I was actually good at one point. I was working on the fingering for a scale (a mere warmup exercise) and my hands kept stumbling over the notes. I took my fingers off the keys and leaned forward to look more closely at the sheet, and then I heard strains of music from the room next to me. 

It was perfect. This person seemed to have complete control of her fingers, racing them up and down the notes, diminishing when needed, and playing more forcefully when needed. The notes resounded in my head long after the piece ended. I couldn't bring myself to touch the keys anymore, so I picked up my books and left. It's strange to say that it drained me."

"event","My days feel entirely spent before I even get to them. Maybe I'm just sick of reading right now, but I'm trying to get on top of stuff before the weekend hits because I want to go out. I've only ""gone out"" once or twice since I've been back, so this weekend is sounding really good right about now.

While shelving the periodicals a few days ago, I flipped through a magazine called the Southern Review, and came across some artwork by Billy Solitario. I absolutely love it. I found it strange, but the art made me immediately think of The Awakening, a book that we're discussing in my American Literature now. What I also found strange was that some of his art is of New Orleans, the setting for part of the book. The paintings seem to evoke the same feelings I get from reading the novel, sort of a solitary desperation (although not nearly as fatalistic as Edna's in the book). Take a look, if you want:

"event","I always have something else in mind to write when I decide to update my journal, but as soon as my fingers hit the keys, my thoughts go a different direction. I'll try to stick to my original thoughts from earlier today...

While sitting in my Victorian Literature class today, I was just hit with a sense of gratitude. Mostly to my family for their sacrifices in letting me go to Hillsdale, but also for the priviledge to be at this college. Yes, I complain about it at times, but it's really the only place I would ever want to be for my first few years. Even listening to my professors speaking (namely Whalen and Kalhtoff) fills me with such an amazing sense of pride. It even pushes aside my feelings of inferiority (I know I'll never be a 4.0, but it won't kill me to try). No one else that I graduted with or any of the people from my hometown or even my family has or will ever have the opportunity that I've been given to study here. It's hard to explain if you haven't felt this, but I feel like I've been let in on a secret, one that will change my life. I'm sure that going away to any school will effect people in similar ways, but I honestly believe that the person I will be when I graduate will be greater because of being here."

I'm driving down to Grand Rapids to meet up with a few girls, then heading to Ludingtion area to play on a lake for a few days. I'm slightly stressed because I still have loose ends to tie up here (computer getting worked on, papers to sign, waiting for books to arrive, etc., etc.), but thankfully my mom is going to come down to Hillsdale this Sunday to take care of that stuff. For now I get to relax and catch up with people I haven't seen all summer and have some fun!

My past weekend was great. I went to Mackinaw area with my mom, and my two aunts (her older sisters). Once they stepped into the car, they all left their problems behind them (for the most part) and just relaxed and had a good time. We took a ferry to the island (GORGEOUS--I want to own property there someday), and we toured the mainland cities, went to a casino (which I was promptly removed from due to the ridiculous age limit which that particular casino has set for gambling--21 of all things...), ate out a lot, shopped and had an overall enjoyable time. It's nice to see your mom and authority figures as people sometimes. 

The next time I update or do anything internet-related probably won't be until after Sunday at some point, so I hope you all have a wonderful week of moving in or vacationing, whatever it is that you're filling your time with :)!"

It's impossible to choose the best songs on here, or the most vital to listen to because it's all just one all-encompassing song to me. I can listen to the CD from beginning to end and it just flows--one big piece. So, even if you're not a fan of Coldplay (how on earth you cannot be, I do not know... their previous recordings are just as breath-taking), this will make you one. Chris Martin's voice takes me to another place; it's ethereal, yet grounded, heart-breaking, yet hopeful, imperfect, yet... Oh, just go burn it, er, uh, I mean buy it.

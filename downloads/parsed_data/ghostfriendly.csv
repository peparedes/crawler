Fourth day of the sack of Holmhaven. Coming back to barrack and pallet after a trash shift. Lifting the spindly, hair-covered corpses of <i>Uuhlz</i> on a pitchfork and tossing them onto the bonfires in the plaza of their city. Hundreds of the creatures dead in the final assault&ndash;hundreds more being driven away chained, for slavery in the mills and mines. Other squads still in their black battle armour were collecting <i>Uuhlz </i>heads and stacked them around the gates. Piles of their hideous pale faces and pointed ears.</p><p>The boys sang the old work-songs as we worked, deep and spirited. They laughed out loud, simply from being alive after so much killing. A few <i>Uuhlz</i> (<i>Elves</i>, as they call themselves) sung out a high wailing song to mourn their city, tearing at their yellow manes. Some boys got fed up with the noise and beat them into silence with rough green fists.</p><p>The city smells of fear, overflowing middens and burning, like any city after a siege. The neatly planned wooden houses are half razed; stone buildings and spires are turned black from white by smoke. It&#39;ll be rebuilt, before Orcs settle here, with sewers, breweries, prisons and factories. The Elves crammed the balconies of many buildings with flowering plants, for their own alien reason. The Warlords have already set up command in the central keep. This morning, they ordered all the plants from the houses thrown down to the streets and burnt. I couldn&#39;t see the point of that.</p><p>I know no Orc soldier can keep a record like this, or not lawfully. But I can&#39;t talk to anyone; they&#39;d not understand if I tried. I spent the last two hours after my shift drinking five hundred-year Elven wine like cheap rotgut, with some boys from the unit. The longer it lasted, the more weary, silenced and angry with <i>something</i> I got.</p><p>The name&#39;s Gazza. Lieutenant in the Spear-Splitter army of the Orc Empire; been in the Spear-Splitters since my warrior-age. Born in the Western Lands, fought in the War of Return&ndash;the years it took to wrestle half the Great Land from the Elf nations had more killing in them together than a hundred sieges like this. The scar from my right eye-tusks to the bridge of my snout was from that too. But then there was the Peace, the first in Orc history. Two years without war, before an Elf army swept out of Rumahon, this eastern forest country. That&#39;s why we&#39;re here now, sitting on their gutted city.</p><p>They hadn&#39;t a hope of driving us back to the sea and the Western Lands&ndash;they just killed every Orc in every town they could sack, and freed their Elf slaves to kill more of us. Slave revolts flared up in districts all over the Empire. The Gutripper and Shield-Breaker armies put those down, with a few mass hangings&ndash;no point in wasting slaves without need. It only took the Spear-Splitter army to corner the Rumahon incursion and put it down. We trapped them in a bend of the Ox river, and took the desperate charge of their cavalry on our pikes. Then we pounded through the storm of arrows, trusting our armour until we reached their lines and cut them down. Rozzag, my comrade since both our Warrior-ages, was killed by a neck-cut. I cut down the Elf who got him a second later. As it bled out, I actually seized its neck, and ask why did his race hate us this much? Its teeth were horribly thin as it grinned, its eyes obscenely big and bright like an insect.</p><p>&quot;Because you hate the Light. And the Light hates everything you do, your malice, your pride&ndash;&quot;</p><p>&quot;What Light? Your God? I don&#39;t know your God!&quot; The creature gave a hacking laugh.</p><p>&quot;How could you know God&hellip;? You&#39;re monsters. It&#39;s our duty to wipe you all&ndash;&quot; Something filled me with rage, and I buried my sword in his head.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p>We&#39;d conquered all the Elves&#39; mudhole countries that we could reach. Made them slaves, but gave them industry, paved roads and proper laws&ndash;civilisation with <i>purpose</i>. The Rumahon incursion made the High Warchiefs decide that it wasn&#39;t enough; there had to be a final demonstration to bring the Empire a final peace. They sent the Spear-Splitter and Limb-lopper armies into Rumahon a few months later. We spent weeks tramping through those <i>guuing</i> forests, getting picked off by archers that vanished into the shadows, ambushes and traps. We kept burning down every town in our path, and herding all the Elves we found into prison camps. Finally the Rumahon Elves pulled all their people back into Holmhaven, their great city from the past age, with stone walls.</p><p>We spent a month blasting those walls with trebuchets and siege cannons, until we had practicable breaches. Then we charged up the hills of gravel in our heavy plate&ndash;the elves on the walls had ornamented armour and thin, delicate blades. Orc swords are dense folded steel with a shallow curve; ugly weapons for chopping torsos in half. The Orcs have only known war from our birth; the arms we forge are the best. The elves still fought hard; the weight of arrows and blades sent some of us tumbling back down the breach. But we threw the last defenders from walls running with blood, and streamed down to the city.</p><p>The War of Return had been a war to bring peace. Orders had always been to accept surrender and spare the unarmed (not that all the boys followed orders, or always got a flogging when they didn&#39;t). Orders for Holmhaven were to kill every Elf big enough to hold a weapon, and make final peace through fear. Us boys who lived to clear the top of that wall truly hated every Elf in the world, by the time we reached their city. We hated the High Warchiefs for sending us all this way to storm another dirthole monster-den. If the Elven God had even appeared to our faces, we&#39;d have hated him too. We were happy to follow our orders, and kill them all. Jacko and some other boys struck a war-song as they killed; a song of death and metal with few lyrics repeatable in cold blood.</p><p>Our squad was clearing the South-West plaza. We&#39;d broken into one of those wooden buildings they call churches, taken all the gold and silver things we could find and thrown down everything else. I was about to move out, when an old Elf in a white robe stepped out and stood before the door. He&#39;d been hiding in a cupboard; we wouldn&#39;t have found him, and he hadn&#39;t a chance of holding me back. He didn&#39;t even seem to be thinking of that; he was just standing, in my way, looking me in the eye. He really didn&#39;t seem afraid, as if there was nothing I could do to him, or he really expected me to stop.</p><p>I drove the butt of my sword into the creature&#39;s ugly head, throwing him aside, and rushed out. The squad followed me. It&#39;s certain that someone else killed that Elf before the dawn. But I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t. I broke the order to kill every adult. But it still doesn&#39;t feel wrong. When killing all those Elves and burning them is right, what<i> is</i> wrong? Can we even talk about that, when Orcs have killed Elves for hundreds of years and Elves have killed us, and none of us seem to have a choice about it anymore?</p><p>No, it is right. The Elves we killed died with honour, weapons in their hands. A final demonstration of what the Orc Empire will do for the cause of peace.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p>Eighteenth day of Sunmonth A week after we took Holmhaven, the Elves attacked the garrison in an outlying Rumahon village. Six Orcs killed; their bodies mutilated and hung from trees. Tunnels have been uncovered in Holmhaven; Elf fighters obviously escaped the sack to join up with however many more were left in the forests.</p><p>The armies were sent out from Holmhaven to set up strongpoints across Rumahon, and send out patrols in force. More troops were sent from the empire to seal the border. My unit was sent on a search-and destroy patrol in the area of the attack. We stumped through miles of soggy forests for days, waiting for someone to get an arrow in the neck. For forest work, we were in half-plate; less noise, less steel. The boys never stopped grumbling about the cold, the mud, and bad rations. A march five times as hard wouldn&#39;t have finished one of them, but they still grumbled, like always. A bitter, constant hum of enmity at this miserable country and world.</p><p>After a few days, Snagrot, the unit&#39;s best tracker, uncovered some traces of Elves heading in one direction; from the map, there was a hamlet over there. The next day was silent marching. Every soldier watched the darkness round the trees, waiting for branches to rustle with more than wind, or the softest noise to break the silence. Snagrot reported that the trail wasn&#39;t branching off. After a few hours even I could see that another Orc patrol was on the same trail ahead of us.</p><p>We finally reached that miserable cluster of wooden houses beside a river. For the first time in days, the sun was shining down from a clear sky. From the edge of the woods I could smell the burning and heard a thin Elven screech. The few boys that could muster a response snorted laughter.</p><p>I ran forward with a dozen others. Soldiers from another unit were moving around the huts, leisurely as sharks. There were Elf bodies laid out already. Small corpses and painfully skinny ones with long manes of hair. Elvish females and young only seem to exist for breeding adults&ndash;they almost never carry weapons.</p><p>An Elf youngling&ndash;he&#39;d have come up to my stomach&ndash;was standing between the huts, clutching a sword in shaking hands. There was another youngling behind him&ndash;a female. An Orc officer was facing him with a battle-axe. Most of the unit were just watching them; from their warpaint, they were from the limb-lopper army.</p><p>&quot;W-why? Why do you have to come here? Why do you&ndash;you orcs hate us like this?&quot;</p><p>The pale little creature had water coming out his huge eyes. He was shaking to the tips of his pointed ears. The officer&#39;s grin showed all the fangs behind his foretusks. There was a blue lightning tatoo across his face and bare scalp; his hairless arms were nearly thicker than the youngling&#39;s waist.</p><p>&quot;You&#39;re <i>Uurlz</i>&ndash;<i>Elves</i>. Puny, stinking little vermin. You can hardly hold that sword. That thing behind you is a useless burden of hair and meat! Don&#39;t need any reason to kill you, none at all.&quot;</p><p>I saw the young female Elf shut her eyes. The other youngling&#39;s eyes stopped making water. It almost looked as if he smiled.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s alright, sister,&quot; I heard him say to her; &quot;You&#39;re not a burden.&quot;</p><p>Then he rushed at the Orc officer without a sound. The battleaxe broke through his sword and chopped his body open without slowing. The boys watching laughed, almost wearily. The female Elf made another screech, and crawled towards her brother. The officer raised his axe again&ndash;but I was in front of him, sword out.</p><p>I didn&#39;t have a reason. Somehow, in an instant, I had seen that this pathetic creature was in <i>pain</i>. Not just fear of death, but something deep, alien and terrible. In lives of war, Orcs only feel for fighting comrades; we&#39;ve got nothing like a family unit. There&#39;s no reason I should ever be capable of feeling an elvish child&#39;s pain. But I had to do something in the instant I felt it.</p><p>&quot;No honour in killing unarmed females. These Elves should be taken to prison camps. No sense in killing good slaves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Who the <i>drek</i> are you? That little maggot is mine. I&#39;m going to kill her, and you&#39;re going to turn around and get the <i>drek</i> out of here.&quot; I shifted my grip on my sword, &quot;You&#39;re going to die for a stinking Elf? Don&#39;t that beat it all? A Elf-lover with milk in his veins&ndash;&quot;</p><p>&quot;<i>Say that again and I&#39;ll carve your guts like a pig!</i>&quot;</p><p>Fangs bared, we glowered into each other&#39;s eyes, searching for a movement that would bring down steel and death. I tried to bite down on my rage. He was bigger than me, but slow and arrogant&ndash;I could take him, but several of the other squad had crossbows trained on my head. I could only hear silence from my own squad&ndash;I supposed they were still digesting &#39;Elf-lover&#39;. I might survive if I backed down now, but I&#39;d never get or deserve another ounce of respect in my life. Also, the Elf youngling would be dead.</p><p>The sun glared mercilessly down. The officer&#39;s tatoo creased, as his glare blazed hotter; my foot shifted an inch. I heard a crossbow being cocked behind me, and wondered if it was aimed at my own neck. Slowly, the other officer relaxed, and waved a hand.</p><p>&quot;Have the maggot, do whatever you want with her. Don&#39;t say nothing about this, or I will have your nads for it.&quot;</p><p>I glanced round; Snagrot had aimed his crossbow at the officer. The other unit was backing down and moving out. The little Elf looked more terrified than ever; I&#39;ve heard that Orc language sounds something like a fight between a pig and a giant ape to Elven ears, though it sounds pleasant enough to us. She had a striking long yellow mane, the same colour as all the Rumahon Elves&ndash;though Elves from any place look just as shrunken and ugly to us, whatever.</p><p>I shoved her towards some of the boys, who were rounding up a few more surviving Elves from their huts. Then I threw an arm round Snagrot&#39;s shoulders.</p><p>&quot;Thanks for that, brother. We did good&ndash;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just don&#39;t try to report that git for killing slaves, Boss.&quot; He hissed at me through his fangs, &quot;And for <i>drek</i>&#39;s sake don&#39;t do nothing that stupid again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? You backed me up didn&#39;t you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I wanted to get out alive. I mean to get out of this dirthole country alive&ndash;meaning, I&#39;m not going to let a good officer get himsElf killed for an <i>Elf</i>. We&#39;ve been killing the maggots since we come here&ndash;saving a couple don&#39;t make us heroes, or different, or nothing. You think it makes a difference to that youngling? She&#39;s still looking at you like a great big monster.&quot;</p><p>I looked back at the little Elf. The boys had roped her in a line with the other prisoners; behind them; after searching the huts for weapon they were burning the rest of them. Her great eyes were fixed on me with all the Elves, shimmering weakly with loathing.</p><p>I&#39;d thought I had to do something, to prove what kind of Orc I was, and not back down from what I felt was right. But what was right, or good, about something I&#39;d done to pacify my own feelings and sElf-respect? These Elves would live, instead of getting cut down. But why did these ones deserve to live, when the hundreds in Holmhaven had been rightly slaughtered? If there was nothing else to goodness then it was a pathetic thing without meaning, in a universe ruled by war and necessity.</p><p>I think there aren&#39;t many Orcs that think like I do. Or maybe they all have these thoughts, but they never find anything to do with them either. My unit finished its patrol without any more trouble, and bunked down at one of the fortified camps to prepare for more search and destroys. I thought about that hamlet, and those Elf younglings for about two days. Then the High Warchiefs&#39; Order for Rumahon reached the camp, and I stopped thinking.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p>Wherever the Rumahon Elves still had weapons, they were still fighting us, none of them were surrendering. The numbers we had killed already had done nothing to show the wisdom of submitting to the Empire. The High Warchiefs had decided that the Elves of Rumahon weren&#39;t ever going to stop fighting us. So all of them would be killed. Every warrior, every old man, every yellow haired female and youngling; no new generation would trouble the Empire again. No other nation or slaves would dare to oppose us. Honour was to be thrown aside for necessity. All the Rumahon Elves in the slave camps would be slaughtered first. Any we found in the country had to be killed on sight. I even went to the prison camp and chopped down a few of them myself. Just like that hamlet by the river, it didn&#39;t feel like anything.</p><p>Our legends say that after the Elves&#39; god created them, the Dark One Maowrath created Orcs to show what life really was. He took some Elves, and changed their bodies and minds to make them strong, hard, free. Impossible to defeat, or to turn from anything they purposed to do. Maowrath vanished from the world centuries ago, after the age of gods. For some reason, nobody&#39;s ever worshipped him for creating us.</p><p>For centuries before the Empire, Orcs were nothing but a heap of feuding, barbarian tribes, always at war with the Elf kingdoms and always losing. We killed as many Elves as we could; we&#39;d even torture them or eat them, in those bad old days. The Elves never did anything like that&ndash;they simply killed Orcs by the thousands with their arrows and horses, more than we ever killed of them.</p><p>Those tribes were finally driven out of the Great Land and across the sea, to the Western Lands. The Elves we met there didn&#39;t live in cities like the ones in the great land. They lived in trees, used stone weapons, and spent most of their time singing about stars and rivers. Orcs wiped them out within years to take the mines and lumber they were living over, and spread over the whole land. Then they warred with each other, over the same mines and lumber&ndash;without honour, war and death, the existence of Orcs had no meaning.</p><p>The Prophet changed that. Seventy years ago, his message spread across the Western Lands like wildfire, leaving nothing the same where it had gone. He preached the incredible message that the purpose of war was final peace. All the Orc tribes had to unite, and fight until all of their enemies were subdued. Then they would discover a meaning in the absence of war that the most glorious struggle and victory could never touch.</p><p>The Orc Empire was born within a generation, and a giant armada was sailing back to the Great Land, and the War of Return. The war for revenge and eternal peace. And now we&#39;re killing an entire people, down to the last youngling, for eternal peace. The bad old days never really end; we run and never get anywhere.</p><br /><br /><br /><br /></lj-cut><br /><br /><br />"

"event","I&#39;ve never even thought&nbsp;before of raging at God, or questioning Him directly.&nbsp;I honestly find it hard to like the ideas that He may want me to completely drop&nbsp;comics, anime and athiest writers,&nbsp;that&nbsp;so many people in the world are&nbsp;going to hell, and that homosexuality is wrong. I&nbsp;can&nbsp;understand and argue why&nbsp;all these things are just. I just can&#39;t <i>like</i> them yet,&nbsp;and the reason can only be ego. As I said, I can&#39;t question God; by definition He&#39;s always right. But I can&#39;t&nbsp;kill the&nbsp;resentment, or stop despairing at my own nature. And I keep sinning, almost&nbsp;as much&nbsp;to hurt&nbsp;God&nbsp;as&nbsp;anything else.&nbsp;If I keep on sinning wilfully, I&#39;m sure&nbsp;I will justly go to hell. And its a sin in itself, but I&nbsp;find&nbsp;it hard to like that either.<br /><br />I&#39;ve hardly ever&nbsp;been truly punished&nbsp;for any wrongdoing with more than guilt, and that hasn&#39;t stopped me yet. The&nbsp;nearest thing to punishment was on a&nbsp;Scout camp when I bit&nbsp;a boy who was&nbsp;harrassing me in some way, and another&nbsp;boy hit me with a stick. I wasn&#39;t in the right, but I still don&#39;t think&nbsp;he was reasonable to do that.<br /><br />Since&nbsp;seriously giving my life to God I&#39;ve&nbsp;recieved the impression that I&#39;ve&nbsp;barely ever&nbsp;loved&nbsp;Him before, except&nbsp;on account of what He gives. I know that His Grace&nbsp;is what makes me acceptable, rather than my love or faith. But I&nbsp;don&#39;t think I could possibly be&nbsp;sinning as&nbsp;blatanly&nbsp;as&nbsp;I am, if I had any love or faith at all. &nbsp;<br />I haven&#39;t even loved my family or friends as humans; I&nbsp;learned by wrote that&nbsp;helping others&nbsp;is right, but&nbsp;hardly&nbsp;ever sacrificed for anybody, or did any more than they&nbsp;wanted from me.&nbsp;Empathy has always been a problem&nbsp;because of my Aspergers; fictional characters are more real to me than living people at times. And I&#39;m finally seeing myself as trapped in a prison of ego, barely able to love, sacrifice, or care about the views of anyone else. I have a choice to accept who I am, or try to change, but change like this could only come from God through faith, and I need more.<br /><br />I&#39;m curious how&nbsp;this&nbsp;perspective would change if I were to fail my PhD next month. I&nbsp;could finally put the will of my flesh to death for God,&nbsp;or get knocked down to a last state worse than my very first. At least&nbsp;God knows what&#39;s going to happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Listed more anime on ebay. I don&#39;t know how many will sell, but I want to get rid of some of them. I ended up destroying&nbsp;all the DVDs for <i>Baccano</i>,<i> Basilisk</i>, <i>Dead Leaves</i> and <i>Lone Wolf and Cub</i>&nbsp;this evening as well, because the content was so unholy, and to show that I could. It was suprisingly difficult; Terry Pratchett mentioned that any bookburning sems naturally wrong to most people because of a certain reverence for any written words.&nbsp;Of course he also wrote in Small Gods about the religious fanatic whose&nbsp;god was only an extension of himself, and an echo of his own voice inside his head. That&nbsp;picture&nbsp;may well&nbsp;haunt me until I die.<br /><br />&nbsp;With a churchgoing family&nbsp;didn&#39;t really have&nbsp;a dramatic conversion event so I couldn&#39;t&nbsp;definately say how God has changed me. In a sense, any good development in me at all is from Him, in&nbsp;another sense, the amount of persistent, serious sin in my life suggests inescapable that&nbsp;I&#39;ve kept Him from doing anything with me at all. Believing in God isn&#39;t ever enough; for my heart to really change I need to value nothing else. In order to really love God, I need to hate sin.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","I&#39;ve always thought that&nbsp;illustrating true pain and despair are&nbsp;some of the most important purposes of literature and storytelling.&nbsp;With my&nbsp;fairly comfortable life,&nbsp;I assumed that a picture of the world&#39;s grimness&nbsp;would be necessary for me to feel compassion and empathy for&nbsp;child soldiers and&nbsp;trapped bureaucrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;What message could be more vital than the way humans live with pain, struggle against it, and&nbsp;seek hope through it? And if the characters&nbsp;never overcome their&nbsp;flaws,&nbsp;and never truely save themselves in the end (they never do), doesn&#39;t that&nbsp;just show once again that humans need God?<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if the intervention of God in the present world can be written about convincingly in fiction; unless it&#39;s experienced, accepted and believed in, any miracle can be dismissed as &#39;unrealistic&#39;. Maybe the most convincing miracles are unexpected answers to prayer,but direct miracles have a certain something as well..<br /><br />The point is that I made a mistake in looking too deeply at survival in a world with a hidden&nbsp;God. Somewhere &#39;humans can&#39;t save themselves&#39; began to sound like &#39;humans can&#39;t be saved&#39;.&nbsp;Rather than&nbsp;disbeliving in God I&nbsp;grew a&nbsp;belief in&nbsp;human darkness, human&nbsp;struggle and in the picture of the ugly &#39;truth&#39; as an end in itself.&nbsp;I&nbsp;still think&nbsp;works like<i> 100 Bullets, Anno Dracula, Gunsllnger Girl, Battle Royale, </i><i>Berserk</i>, <i>Baccano </i>and<i> Scalped&nbsp;</i>are&nbsp;great works of imagination and writing, but all either ignore God or actively oppose both Him and the whole concept of goodness. What does this say about writing, or for that matter, imagination? What does it say about me that I even admit their good qualities, while&nbsp;hating their fatal ones?<br /><br />(<i>Preacher,</i> by the by, is both opposed to God and, in my opinion, a nasty, vicious&nbsp;heap of bile).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />My problem with&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;Christian fiction is that everyone knows the ending already. Even a genuine redemptive masterpiece like <i>Les Miserables </i>has as much darkness in it as light. If I keep&nbsp;reading or writing stories, I&nbsp;want them to have tension,&nbsp;real despair, and room for interpretation. They must have hope, and the hope can only be God; God&nbsp;does not admit&nbsp;multiple interpretations. Which is&nbsp;why I don&#39;t know&nbsp;if I&#39;ll ever be able to write about Him in a story until I understand a lot more about God and writing.<br /><br /><br />Does anyone know any good books or comics with a more positive outlook on the world?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Finally have comments on 1st draft of thesis back. There some large mistakes I could&#39;ve changed if I&#39;d spent more effort on it rather than getting the first draft in as quickly as possible&nbsp;4 months ago, and an underlying lack of professionalism and presentation I&#39;m not sure what I could have done about. This is the&nbsp;first PhD thesis I&#39;ve written, after all...but it should have been better.

When I was in secondary school, my teachers told me I wouldn&#39;t be good at science, and I was proud to get straight As (apart from a D in the module for organic synthesis, the subject in which I&#39;m aiming to get a PhD). In undergrad, I was told that I didn&#39;t have much potential to work in science, and&nbsp;went on to get a 2:1 and MSc with distinction. Now&nbsp;my co-workers are telling me I&#39;ve little chance of working in chemistry, and even my supervisor says I shouldn&#39;t work in the organic synthesis field I&#39;ve spent the last 3 years researching....3 years&nbsp;of self-directed research in which I&#39;ve become unmotivated,&nbsp;overfocused, uncreative and flaccid. 3 years I&#39;m increasingly worried that I&#39;ve misused, making myself less able to work in chemistry rather than more. I&#39;m&nbsp;really not sure what future my PhD and my work have; I&#39;m&nbsp;might even be starting to believe what I&#39;ve been told.&nbsp;"

I know&nbsp;that&nbsp;worring so much about what I write is&nbsp;a kind of idolatory, and&nbsp;don&#39;t feel close to God at all compared to last week, but I can&#39;t be indifferent&nbsp;if I&#39;ve&nbsp;posted something&nbsp;against God.

"event","Largely in order to escape from persistent sin I&#39;ve been&nbsp;focusing on prayer&nbsp;and watching a lot of sermons&nbsp;by&nbsp;well-known pastors recently (their points aren&#39;t generally new, indeed&nbsp;they&#39;d hardly be biblical if&nbsp;they were, but <i>are</i> put with such depth of feeling and insight as to really communicate the message). Today I watched a John Piper sermon&nbsp;on the theme that a Christian life must involve suffering, then a two minute clip on preordination. My immediate reaction was to thank God He had saved me completely through&nbsp;His own power,&nbsp;and my next was to&nbsp;consider all&nbsp;the other people, no&nbsp;worse in themselves than me, who weren&#39;t going to be saved.&nbsp;And I suffered&nbsp;at least as badly as any time I&#39;ve actually sinned. I could remember that &#39;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#39;, but&nbsp;how&nbsp;could anyone accept being saved while many more were condemned?<br /><br />&#39;My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters. I would be willing to be forever cursed--cut off from Christ!--if that would save them.&#39;-(Paul) Romans 9:2-3<br /><br />Otherwise,&nbsp;a Christian&#39;s goal would be&nbsp;merely to save himself rather than glorify God. Otherwise, any compassion&nbsp;they might feel for non-Christians would ring completely hollow. Of course, no human&nbsp;would be capable of consiously damning themselves, but the aspiration is part of emulating the sacrifice of Jesus. Even if they w<i>ere </i>capable, it would be dreadful for a human to give back the gift of salvation God had chosen to give him; and beyond&nbsp;any human to judge&nbsp;between heaven and hell for another; only God can judge.<br /><br />That verse was some help, anyway,&nbsp;as was a book by David Wilkerson&nbsp;I&#39;d&nbsp;had lying around for ages, that reminded readers in this situation to cast their burdens on God, and admit to some things being beyond&nbsp;understanding (though I&#39;ve thought up some objections to the preordination clip, I imagine there are counter-objections etc). I asked God for peace, and that he would let me focus on His&nbsp;mercy rather than His judgement, though I still wanted to remember the latter to appreciate what He&#39;d saved me from. After a&nbsp;time, I&nbsp;did feel peace,&nbsp;real gratitude, and&nbsp;the message that God really is&nbsp;saddened, more than I could imagine, by&nbsp;disbelief, Something Calvinism&nbsp;can often lead one to forget in my experience.<br /><br />This is just meant to show that, even if there are&nbsp;troubling things when considering God, there are cures for all of them. Or that,&nbsp;as my&nbsp;mother said, I need to find&nbsp;a job soon, and generally do rather than only think.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"

Every crisis of events I reach seems to be merely bumbled through without arresting destruction or resolution; but things are definately changing.<br /><br />The paper I mentioned in June has been accepted, my&nbsp;primary success; the practical side of my PhD has ended without disasters or significant further discoveries. The thesis I&#39;m beginning to seriously write rests on a simple idea handed to me in 1st year; an indisputably&nbsp;valuable, verified and developed idea, but only one. I&#39;m beginning to&nbsp;recieve interveiw invitations, but receiving advice for my supervisor to apply for less&nbsp;demanding instrumentation jobs rather than synthesis. I probably need to relearn&nbsp;four&nbsp;years of taught chemistry before&nbsp;my eventual Viva; my&nbsp;working efficiency and, consequently,&nbsp;engagement with God are almost as low as they&#39;ve been.<br /><br />Which isn&#39;t to say there aren&#39;t good sides to&nbsp;living at home in Bristol again while&nbsp;I write up.&nbsp;But&nbsp;I still have the feeling&nbsp;from the last three years of&nbsp;a falling man before&nbsp;he hits the ground. As I&#39;ve said before, things can&#39;t go on like this.&nbsp;I&#39;m well into the stage where I need to be making a lot more problems for myself.<br /><br />As well as the PhD, the endings of the comcs <i>Scalped</i>,<i> DMZ</i> and <i>Northlanders</i> have been announced. An independent comic shop within walking distance is something I&#39;m going to miss about Loughborough University, as well as the Well church and everyone there. I&#39;m quite content about the Drop-In Centre, old-people&#39;s reading group&nbsp;and Gaming Society&nbsp;continuing&nbsp;uninterrupted without me.<br /><br />&nbsp;I haven&#39;t taken a holiday this year, and&nbsp;should be going to Greece with Phil&nbsp;in a few weeks; as usual it was his idea.

I was unable to plan work, pray, make tea or even finish the Claymore story I'd unblocked that afternoon, but just had to write the wretched thing. Today I got into work late, wrote during my lunch break and very nearly broke the newly repaired NMR machine because I wasn't concentrating when I put my sample on. It was literally like the <a href=""http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheRedShoes_e.html"">Red Shoes</a>.<br /><br />(That I didn't actually break the NMR, despite forgetting about God and acting stupidly enough to deserve it, shows that He's faithful to the faithless, once again)<br /><br />I've managed to put both stories on hold so I can arrange things for Phil when he visits for the weekend, but I'm&nbsp;still a bit worried.&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;write full time&nbsp;if I wouldn't&nbsp;be as bad&nbsp;a writer as a chemist (I certainly don't feel a brilliant chemist at the moment).

If he was always fighting with his friends instead of forgiving them...you might be like Sarah Crewe in the story, with no Daddy at all.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Mmmph...!&rdquo; Mireille buried herself in her Mamma&rsquo;s side. Odette steadied her hand, as she touched her daughter&rsquo;s hair.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, Mireille. Think how Sarah always stayed true to herself. No matter where her Daddy was, she knew she was always his little princess.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Mmmph, but Sarah Crewe never had a Mama and Daddy like you! You&rsquo;ve looked after me so well...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;We always tried.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, they set off back to the mansion, hand in hand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to play piano in the evening aren&rsquo;t you, Mamma? I really want to play beautiful music like you when I grow up. Papa says I should be a writer because I&rsquo;m always reading, and Fabio says I should be an archaeologist, because he&rsquo;s crazy about dinosaurs...what do you think I&rsquo;ll be when I grow up, Mamma?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Odette gazed at Mireille&rsquo;s pink, bright-eyed face, &ldquo;I...almost want you to just stay a sweet little girl.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Ooo, you should read Peter Pan, Mamma; only boys like Fabio and Papa want to never grow up. I want to grow up soon, so I can be with you and Papa, even when you go to Ajacchio or France on difficult grown up business.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Odette&rsquo;s lips trembled, but the smile she finally gave her daughter was indomitable.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Evening came, and cars piled up in the Bouquet mansion&rsquo;s drive. The veranda filled with men who were drinking wine together rather than shooting each other in the streets, and perfectly happy about it. George Madeline brought out a crate of his homebrewed beverage; Fabio tried a sip and had to retire early. Odette, wearing a red gown and a diamond necklace Mireille couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes from, played several Chopin pieces on the piano to heartfelt applause. Mireille herself recited &lsquo;The Owl and the Pussycat&rsquo; with barely a tremble or slip; she saw the smiles around her, and flushed happily.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;A band naturally formed up, and dancing began; Odette pulled Larent Bouquet from his chair, and they swung about with the gusto of sixteen-year olds. Mireille was hampered by her partner&rsquo;s relative height, but a sedate tempo definitely suited her uncle&rsquo;s strong, grave face.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Is it allowed to be as happy as this?&rdquo; She called to him over the laughter and music. Uncle Claude smiled quietly, and squeezed her hands,</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, Mireille. Be as happy as you can be, in the times of happiness.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;But I thought we were going to France, not Spain...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;The place is between both countries.&rdquo; Mireille shied at the tightness of her Papa&rsquo;s words, and quickly looked out the car window. Some workers in a field were bowing down, as she rolled past them towards the queer-looking old village.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;In the village meeting hall, the Bouquets were joined by another couple and a thin, mousey girl, younger than Mireille. The Corsican Princess smiled at her confidently, but had no response. The little girl had her mother&rsquo;s dark hair and eyes, but didn&rsquo;t even seem sad, just not much of anything. The grown-ups sat down without exchanging a word.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Before a very important person arrived, Mireille and the other girl were turned out to play round the back. Moodily, she squatted beside the door.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; She finally broke the silence, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Mireille, of the Bouquet family. It&rsquo;s polite if someone smiles at you to give them one back.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry...I don&rsquo;t know any other girls, so I guess I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You must have friends! Or do you spend all the time at home with your parents?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Um...they&rsquo;re not hardly ever there, but I stay at home yeah. They say there&rsquo;s dangerous people outside, so they don&rsquo;t let me out alone.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t your Mamma and Papa love you at all?&rdquo; The girl stared as if she didn&rsquo;t know what Mireille was talking about. &ldquo;Oh, forget it.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Turning away from a companion she found plain and boring, Mireille idly watched the birds hop between branches in the forest. Chloe watched too, occasionally glancing at Mireille. The Corsican barely noticed (and would forget, until the day Chloe kicked her into a stone floor and brought a knife to her throat) a sharpness buried in her stare.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Finally giving in to temptation, Mireille stood on tiptoe to eavesdrop on her parent&rsquo;s important talk through the village hall keyhole. The French voice she heard was gentle, but somehow seeped into the heart so deeply, she only dared catch a few words;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;...Monsieur and Madame Bidarte. As true Soldats, your sacrifice will receive exquisite honour. Monsieur and Madame Bouquet...from all I hear, your daughter is a gentle girl. I suppose I will have to be very gentle with her. Sicily, I hear, is a beautiful country; an excellent place for children...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The Bouquets soon emerged from the village hall; her father silently scooped Mireille up in his arms. Back in the car, she sleepily noticed the Bidartes leaving as well, barely registering that their daughter was not with them.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Mireille never really found out what had been done to create Silvana Greone. Meeting other Mafia women, meek, grovelling homemakers equally blind to their husband&rsquo;s businesses and infidelities, was no great help. Maybe an absolute code like the <i>Omerta</i> simply required a few sociopaths each generation, of either gender.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;All Mireille saw when she was nine was that the Greone&rsquo;s daughter was unimaginably pretty, head as sleek as a falcon&rsquo;s, eyes shining with an unworldly joy. While her father talked with the Sicilian men over wine, the two girls stole off to the cliffs together without a word. Although the daughter of the Bouquets was naturally revered by children and teachers alike at her school, she realised the moment Silvana appeared that she had never really had a friend, and that getting to know the older girl was her most urgent wish. Silvana&rsquo;s quietly eager smile, she hoped, indicated a similar desire.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;They ran beside each other in the grass with equal vigour, knitted buttercup crowns for one princess to give to another. As easily as that, Mireille fell into the violet gaze of her first friend. Silvana&rsquo;s little eyes surrounded her like still waters, with an interest that made her happy to be Mireille Bouquet.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Thrilling with sudden nervousness, Mireille glanced over the cliff. She could feel something near to her shift, when the distant wave-crashes made her flinch back. But Silvana was smiling. Just as if they were playing together again, as she raised the knife from her waistband, with a practised grip.<br /><br />&nbsp;Mireille fell back, away from the cliff. Unpunishable by humanity, Silvana held death, like a toy. Mireille&rsquo;s soul was torn away by her glance. It didn&rsquo;t matter if she fought or forgave when her life would be gone in a heartbeat. And her friend would never forgive her, because there was nothing that she had done.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Alone on the clifftop, Silvana almost invited a suicidal rush to bear them both into the sea. Mireille never forgot the terror. Never forgot that she was the only one who could possibly have been her friend. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I know no fear. What about you, Mireille?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;After she had finished, Silvana hauled Mireille back to the lodge. Near-insensible, she heard her sobbing out how the Corsican girl had fallen on a rock and been cut. Her father&rsquo;s hands grasped her shoulders; Mireille flinched away with a moan, and collapsed on the gravel path.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;In Corsica, Mireille hid in a darkened bedroom, as if blinded by madness or cruel sunlight. It was a week before she looked at her face in the mirror and screamed out her tears.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;She stuck close to her Daddy after that; or when he was away, close to his friends with the bare forearms, and waistcoats that bulged at the shoulder. They were glad of her company, though all &nbsp;soon realised that even the lightest touch made her tremble, like a flower in bloom about to fall in pieces.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Odette finally sat Mireille down. She told her that there truly were horrible things in the world, but they could never be allowed to spoil the precious ones. It was the same world they had always laughed in together; happiness was in it, if you searched for the true light.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Will you protect me? Will nothing horrible ever happen again?&rdquo; Odette saw in Mireille eyes that she held out little hope.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Mireille...I will always, always love you. I would make a scar on my brow if it would heal yours.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Mamma, no!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Hush, Mireille. Please...however you can live on, keep smiling.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ndash;0&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Please. Look after Mireille.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;She had heard the first two gunshots, in the corridor leading to the veranda. Through the door, her mother looked away from her, smiling. There was a third shot; she could not shut her eyes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;When she stepped onto the veranda, no one was there. The smell from the bodies defiled what it touched. The tune still tinkling from her father&rsquo;s pocket watch sounded quite different, in the otherworld where precious voices were silent. The love and forgiveness of ten years poured from her heart, and vanished in the burning heat, but the pool of blood that almost reached her feet remained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;As silent as her family, Mireille lived on. She did not cry, because no one would hear her again.</p><br /></lj-cut>"

Mustang&rsquo;s grin kept circling her darkened brain, but there was nothing the girl who&rsquo;d gone to Ishbal would have called emotion. She couldn&rsquo;t even imagine what she could say to him.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Murderer. Two hundred red eyes opened up around her body. A hundred recoils struck her until she wept. From every rock and wall in the dreams that hid to kill, the little splashes of blood went on and on and wouldn&rsquo;t stop and the terror would never stop until she was dead.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;She could suppress; she&rsquo;d had to learn. But tonight, there was nothing left in her when the killing was gone. A cold abyss where love and anger and a reason for living had been.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Riza always believed she would have shot herself right then, if not for Roy. His fire filled the darkness. The fire she had nurtured and loved since they had been kids in a rickety wooden house, the fire that would burn up Roy and all the good of the world. He had always run further than her, when they were children, and always into trouble. It was her job, once again, to find him and save him from himself, so they could go back to that little house together at evening, and sleep forever.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;A figure, trudging nearer, from the direction of the officer&rsquo;s billets; thickset, hooded. Peering at Riza&ndash;she rose like a wooden soldier, and marched past the man, eyes front. He reeked of cheap whiskey; probably a black-marketeer leaving camp, no one who mattered&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Miss Hawkeye?&rdquo; Riza stopped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an...acquaintance of Major Mustang, I suppose. He mentioned you&ndash;and I&rsquo;ve heard from all over that you&rsquo;ve watched over him through the heaviest fighting. Probably saved him from death&ndash;so I&rsquo;d like to thank you. As I said, he&rsquo;s a friend. A good officer&ndash;the only one in Ishbal with no aim but protecting lives.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s lives. And I&rsquo;m afraid that I hate every soldier in the world.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Soldier&rsquo;s lives are the ones in danger, Miss Hawkeye; that&rsquo;s how it should be. And the ones that sell their souls, so everyone else has the choice of keeping theirs...like Equivalent Exchange, we pay for the country&rsquo;s peace and we pay for our sins. Mustang understands it; this massacre couldn&rsquo;t be paid by anything we can do right now, alone. If he were running this country&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Rockbells had a six year old daughter. All they did was keep saving Ishbalans when the Military told them to stop. &nbsp;What exactly could ever pay for that?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The hooded man sighed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I used to really believe it; that I could repay the ones my work had hurt with the lives I would save in the end. I&rsquo;m an old man now, and I can&rsquo;t believe it any more. You&rsquo;re still young, Miss Hawkeye, you and Major Mustang. I pray that your experience is different.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The man trudged on, looking warily around every few steps. Riza watched him go, then turned, and marched on.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt"">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Roy Mustang slept in a small room on the edge of a burnt out city. He raised his head as Riza walked in, blinking like a tousle-headed child, albeit one with a smell of whiskey detectable from outside the door. He stared into the mirror from his chair, as Riza raised her gun to the back of his head. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Good to see you again, Cadet. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it; shouldn&rsquo;t have done any of it. This is the way it should end&ndash;take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Riza fought not to look away; she would break down if she did. Guns had always been simple, never time to feel or think&ndash;she had to pull the trigger, save thousands of innocents from death.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were lost, and Roy was here. Her only Roy Mustang. If she didn&rsquo;t call to him now, he would remain for life or death, in the pit where he had fallen. They were soldiers. Whatever their sins, they left nobody behind.&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Is this your wish, Major?&rdquo; Riza spoke very softly. Mustang looked at her over his shoulder.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I...does it matter what I want?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Riza uncocked and holstered her gun, speaking quickly.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;At 0900 hrs tomorrow, 10<sup>th</sup> Division will attack the Ishbalan town, Jasparting. Get some sleep, right now. Take a shower in the morning and drink a pot of coffee; if you&rsquo;re hung-over or exhausted, men will die for it. Whatever state you&rsquo;re in, whatever you&rsquo;ve done, major...you&rsquo;re needed.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;...okay. Take care of yourself, Cadet. Please.&rdquo; Riza didn&rsquo;t look back, as she walked away through military tents in the night. Someone in the distance was playing the guitar very badly A window was lit in the Medical Research facility; two yawning orderlies were carrying out a burden toward the mass grave in the empty city.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;She could fight, to save these undeserving lives, and put off putting a gun in her mouth. Until a day no brighter than any other, when the fighting would end. Then she would have to find something else to cover the grave-pit in her head. Because Major Mustang had asked her to take care of herself; he had thought of her after all the years and deaths. It mattered more to her than all the murdered doctors in the world.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;At 0830 hrs the next day, Riza&rsquo;s bedroll was wet with tears. It was a selfish, stupid obsession. Just like her father, buried in his alchemy; careless of all the people it would end up killing. If God really looked down from the burning sky, as Riza marched on towards Jasparting, he should have condemned her. But the dust whistled around the town and the soldiers, and nothing happened.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt"">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Hours after the city had been cleared, Riza kicked open a bedroom door, and stood by the window, rifle at her side. The Armestrian sniper in the opposite house had been killed with a single shot; the hostiles were now exchanging fire with a patrol at the far end of the street. In the five minutes before Major Mustang arrived, they would have to escape the house where they were holed up, by the back door that Riza&rsquo;s gun was now fixed on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;A harsh call made her glance up; she smiled thinly at the shadow hovering over the sun. Another rifle crack from the house down the street returned her eye to her sights. In last year&rsquo;s failed attack on Jasparting, both sides had knocked through thin connecting walls to outflank their opponents in street battles, but Riza had checked her house already.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;It was definitely an Armestris rifle firing; of course the Ishbalans had captured scores. Then there were stories of soldiers who went mad with fear, and would shoot anything they saw within range. That would be a terrible way to go. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;They would flee away from the patrol, to her. She would hear them if they broke through the wall downstairs&ndash;there had been a wardrobe against the wall. She had checked it, but not carefully&ndash;outside the door to the room, someone breathed. Riza gasped.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;There was a second, and then both women moved. Riza saw it was a woman, and she didn&rsquo;t bring her gun round and fire, but the Ishbalan woman did. Something slammed in her chest; she fell back through the window behind her and hit the dust in the street below with a crack.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt"">*<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The sun filled Riza&rsquo;s eyes; her arm screamed when she tried to lift it. She moved her eyes, and stared at a scorpion resting in the wall&rsquo;s shadow, pulling a cricket apart with its claws. The hawk&rsquo;s shadow moved across her face; an old symbol of justice. When she drew a breath, she would feel her wound, and it would suck life out. Heaven and hell would devour her between them, like the scorpion and the hawk would.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Breath. Coughing, pain in her lungs and chest, no bullet in there. Nowhere in her body&ndash;in her rifle. The carefully polished side was rent where the shot had ricocheted off.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Her gun. Riza had cleaned and wrapped it for years, like a baby. Tried with her soul to understand all of what it did, even when she hated the burden. Now it had protected her, as if a flower had sprung up on a plain of death. No matter the weight, the world still made hope. She was alive.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The next back door along slammed open. The Ishbalan woman burst out and ran, to fire on other troops in another place. Riza drew her pistol, rolled over, sparing her fracture and rested the gun&rsquo;s butt on a rock as she aimed. With a cry the hawk dove on the scorpion; sometimes the war totally surprised, sometimes it was sickeningly predictable.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The woman turned to the sound, fumbled with her gun. Half the row of houses behind them exploded in flames, as Riza fired.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The woman fell, but she was breathing. Riza trudged to her side, gun aimed. The Ishbalan woman had the strong, fleshy body made for hard living in the desert; her hair was a torrent of white curls under her scarf. Riza saw her spit blood into the dirt as she prayed.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Why...why&rsquo;d you fight? Your religion doesn&rsquo;t let women fight.&rdquo; It was all Riza knew about Ishbalan religion, apart from the rubbish the Military had put out about facemasks on women and beatings to drive out demons, &ldquo;For your children?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh-uh&ndash;all dead,&rdquo; The woman gasped, &ldquo;Protect from you...anyone. Somewhere. Don&rsquo;t know. Fucked if I know,&rdquo; She grinned, and Hawkeye suddenly smiled with her.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;She choked out the last line of the prayer. It was the prayer all the Ishbalans said before they died, in Armestrian, and her eyes were fixed on Riza&rsquo;s all the time.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;<i>I am a mote of sin, on the great plain of Ishbala&rsquo;s mercy. Oh God of the universe, grant us peace and salvation. With love like the sky you take our sins from us; as far as the East from the West.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The woman breathed out, and was dead; as far from Riza as could be imagined. She stood over the woman for a time, looking up at the sky, before she left to find a medic.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The next day she buried a child&rsquo;s body that had been left where he&rsquo;d been shot, beside the road.

One boy, watching the young man like a father, as the orphan boys all watched men on the battlefield. Through her scope, Hawkeye saw the man cock his head. The child flushed, nudging his cloak over the canteen Riza had spotted glinting among the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;One week ago, (the last week before Fuhrer Directive 306) Riza had been attached to one of the Special Units formed early in the war. Their remit was to surpass the Ishbalans at their own guerilla tactics; by reputation, they even surpassed them in brutality. The rebels they had hunted that week through the Kanada hills might have been an exception. Riza had heard the stories of them using children. Now she was looking at one, from a hollow in the cliff above him.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebels had hidden themselves under the dust and rocks around a narrow gully. The Special Unit had taken stations surrounding the entire group. The air was still with heat, and the signal to attack had been given. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t make it hurt less, but Hawkeye shot the boy first. She'd heard no father should see their child die&ndash;but she remembered how&nbsp;helpless a child could be with that pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp; Firing again, Riza thought of the chilling hours waiting outside her father&rsquo;s study. His absorption that frightened when her voice couldn&rsquo;t break it. Those two fighters had probably shared more of their work and lives together, than she had with anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;Less than thirty minutes later, Riza moved closer to the broken ground where the last rebels had been pinned. Dropping into an entrenchment, she almost squashed Lieutenant Bulow, and stammered an apology. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Not a problem, Cadet.

Oh hell, I don&rsquo;t believe it. They teach children to kill, and the bastards think they can just surrender.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;Hawkeye and the Lieutenant walked forward, sidearms drawn, as half-a-dozen Ishbalans staggered into the open with their hands on their heads. They were aged thirteen to sixty-five, and all wounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;The Teacher must have treatment for his wounds.&rdquo; A skinny, good-looking boy kept speaking as he was pushed to his knees, &ldquo;You must help him&ndash;all of us swore to protect his life&ndash;&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weeping here. Smith and Kluckson would too if you hadn&rsquo;t fucking shot them.&rdquo; Three soldiers leveled their rifles at a bearded old priest, calmly dressing his leg wound. His crimson eyes moved quickly over them all with an intense abstraction. Somehow, even now, it frightened Riza&ndash;but she wouldn&rsquo;t look away.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Sir, these men should be taken for questioning. I didn&rsquo;t shoot to wound their leader so you could throw away an intelligence goldmine.&rdquo; Riza saw Lieutenant Bulow&rsquo;s teeth clench. A sergeant with tattooed arms and knives across his chest spat and started to speak, &ldquo;These are rebels, but they are prisoners! If you kill prisoners, how can you ever speak against the Ishbalans for doing the same?&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;She would remember her words years later, as one of the sickeningly stupid things she had done in Ishbal. At the time, she only felt tiredness, and the idea that after taking four lives she not only had a right not to put up with this, but a duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;The tattooed sergeant prodded the young Ishbalan, &ldquo;Hear that, you backstabbing fuck? We bring you civilization; we apparently bring you our women&ndash;what the hell do you have against us?&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Riza snapped, &ldquo;Tell this man why you are fighting.&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really beautiful, you know?&rdquo; The boy blurted out.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I had to say it.

Until she saw the eyes of a double amputee in Risenbool, Riza would not see such broken strength. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Kid, was that meant to be a love confession? Kinda obvious it&rsquo;s your first time.&rdquo; The soldiers laughed. Another, even younger child soldier spat on the sergeant&rsquo;s boots; he responded with a kick that audibly broke the&nbsp;boy's jawbone. <o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Sergeant, <i>stand down</i>!&rdquo; Riza breathed into a tight silence, staring at her raised handgun. She turned on the old priest, whose eyes were closed in prayer. &ldquo;Is that your religion? Your teaching? How do you send boys to their deaths for the sake of such <i>shit</i>, and think of living on?&rdquo; The priest spoke quietly in Ishbalan, voice rich and deep, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak Ishbalan! I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; His weary smile&nbsp;shocked Riza with its memory of her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;My children are entrusted to heaven.

Riza put her weapon on her forearm and shot him through the head; then he was much the same as any falling body. She sobbed out, once.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;How does it feel to be a war criminal, Miss Cadet?&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;Bulow must&rsquo;ve seen the threat in Riza&rsquo;s eyes&ndash;he snatched her rising gun and pushed her down on her face, as the single shots began.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 36pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;The captain&nbsp;had fish-eyes, and a tiny mustache&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You want to confess to murdering Ishbalans, Cadet?

The power of his vision was more than his teacher&rsquo;s had ever been; but when he talked about hurt, compassion was naked in the tension of his mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;He smiled at her, embarrassed by his own words, in a place like this. It was the smile from the time they had set the kitchen on fire together, the time she had bought a dog home that messed on her father&rsquo;s bed, the time Roy had accidently used her schoolbooks to prop up an alembic that exploded. The one time they had gone to the fields behind the house together when she had been sixteen. The smile meant that no matter how crazy things were now, he would make it alright.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;Riza reminded herself that she hadn&rsquo;t seen him for years. He might have someone else; she could see that he&rsquo;d gone through worse things than her. Whatever had changed, though, she could keep back a tiny pride in the bit of him that was hers.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;In the Ishbalan town the next day, Riza saw Roy blasting flame through streets full of human being. He gazed at the ring on his finger as if he hadn&rsquo;t understood what if meant. Sniffed the air, as the bodies in the fire sizzled like a million gunshots.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;She understood she would have to protect him too.

Behind a ruined wall that did nothing to conceal the familiar movement, they were raping her.&nbsp;There was no laughter; the toneless noises of man and woman only differed in that one was weakening. The two men waiting their turn were playing a game with dice.</span><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial""><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;The scene hung in her scope like a lantern show.

There would be no ballistics test; as if a crime could be committed here. The Ishbalans had crates of captured Armestrisian Mausers. She had gone to war with a gun to protect the weak. That mean putting a bullet in the soldiers. Or the woman, or all of them.</span><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial""><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;The Ishbalan woman was silently praying&ndash;from the lip movements, it was the same as the priest Riza had shot. She still didn&rsquo;t know what it meant, or how anyone could pray to any god in Ishbal. But with a gun in hand it was easier to be God yourself than just another sinner.</span><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial""><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;She had a choice.

She couldn&rsquo;t give up on him.</span><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial""><o:p></o:p></span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"">&nbsp;Riza wiped moisture from her scope, then sighted and fired a shot into the ruined wall. All three soldiers spread out, cursing and snatching their weapons up.

"event","<br />Got around to editing my tags and blurb; will snag some more icons sometime soon.<br /><br />&nbsp; The new tags&nbsp;are mainly anime fandoms; I've watched a lot more anime, some very, very foolish. There's always a new series to surprise you though, and an intoxicating mass of new worlds. There are&nbsp;many anime series I will be watched at the same time I read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (that is, not unless I'm compelled).&nbsp;But I really need to refrain from watching any more <em>Heroman</em>.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; With the amount of time, and reasonable effort, I've put into Taekwondo over the years, I could certainly put that as a tag; such a modern martial art hardly gets artistic recognition at all though. I'm still doing distressingly little reading these days (Going to Paris next week, so I should get a little further with<em> Ulysses</em>), but <em>Les Miserable </em>was wonderful for the heapings of beautiful description, and utterly sympathetic characters, and never more than a little hard to plough through.<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;You know, Monseiur Marius, I think I was a little bit in love with you.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; Man, that guy could cut straight to the nerve when he wanted to.<br /><br />&quot;So ferde another clerk with astromye; <div class=""linewrap""><div class=""line"" n=""3458"">He walked in the feeldes, for to prye</div></div><div class=""linewrap""><div class=""line"" n=""3459"">Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,</div></div><div class=""linewrap""><div class=""line"" n=""3460"">Til he was in a marle-pit yfalle;</div></div><div class=""linewrap""><div class=""line"" n=""3461"">He saugh nat that.&quot;<br /><br />Yes, <em>Cantebury Tales</em> is funny, as well as being one those stories where you go about repeating some parts just for the fun of it. Good thing to read, really.<br /><br />Hoping to have lunch with Bayan in the afternoon, who I haven't seen for ages.</div></div><br />"

Possible Sheshka/Furey and Sheshka/Winry<br />Rating: G<br />Summary: My chpt 104 fic. A piece of Sheshka's life<br />Warnings: spoilers for chpt 104<br />Chapter Length: 1500+<br />Crossposted to<lj comm=""fma_fiction""/>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><lj-cut><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;When every book she had clung to was its own proud world, Private Sheshka had little trouble accepting that the Hughes&rsquo; lived in a different world from her. A family saga full of comforting friends and unbreakable bonds. Still, they made her feel like they had no one else, she knew deep down she had no one like them, and if she had no proper place in their lives, neither did murder, or grief.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Of course, she wished General Hughes hadn&rsquo;t been shot. But if he had lived, Gracia would have been another vanishing acquaintance. There would still have been a storybook on Sheshka&rsquo;s lap&ndash;but never even another woman&rsquo;s child.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, erm....next Tuesday? I&rsquo;ll definitely watch; unless I forget or something! The last one we had was 1564&ndash;I mean, er, the last one visible in Central...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Bookworm lady remembers everything!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Haha, only sometimes I forget to! Elysia, how about some more painting? Maybe the knight and the hydra in the story&ndash;yes!&ndash;I&rsquo;ll come and see, then we&rsquo;ll read the last chapter.&rdquo; Elysia hopped down, and trotted to the kitchen.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Have you been well, Sheshka?&rdquo; Even prostrate on the sofa after a hard day at the flowershop, Gracia&rsquo;s easy manner inspired affectionate envy.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yes&ndash;uh, we&rsquo;ve had lots of paperwork after the Drachman and Cretan incursions, and I&rsquo;m reading this wonderful 12<sup>th</sup> century fantasy and, er, some other books...I started going out with the girls from work, sometimes, if I&rsquo;m not working too late&hellip;Um, so, I meant to ask, if you&rsquo;d heard anything of the Elric brothers...and their friend&ndash;wasn&rsquo;t it Winry&ndash;who visited with them...?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, Winry? Heavens, she wrote, but she always had her work in Rush Valley; I suppose she must still be there. I didn&rsquo;t know you were friends.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Not really, I only met her here once....I remember it perfectly. I mean, like I always remember...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d certainly love to see her again as well. Perhaps she&rsquo;ll finally have made Edward confess.&rdquo; Sheshka&rsquo;s eyes rested on the frames of her glasses. Gracia smiled impishly, &ldquo;How are you getting on with Sergeant Furey, Sheshka?&rdquo;</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Eh? No, no, we&rsquo;re only penpals because we chatted sometimes and I, we, we were worried about his posting to the South&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re waiting for him to come home safe. Just like Maes and I.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh, goodness! But, Mrs Gracia, I&rsquo;m in the army too.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Gracia implied with her eyes that female genre conventions weren&rsquo;t so easily reversed. Sheshka couldn&rsquo;t get out that Kain hadn&rsquo;t replied to her last letter. Her previous irregularly posted scrawls had all been answered within a week, and she couldn&rsquo;t imagine that he&rsquo;d been killed, so that probably just made it another untold story without the energy to conclude itself.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;He was a nice boy. Along with her willingness to listen to radio-talk, that had probably been the only reason he&rsquo;d kept sitting with her. He was organised, irreconcilably more so than her, and read the books she&rsquo;d lent him only very slowly. He was as different from Winry as a technical manual from a modern adventure.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Does Winry make Automail in Rush Valley? Her own proper work...I, um, feel like I can only dream about such confidence, Mrs Gracia.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Just hold your head up, darling. Don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re ashamed of your own breasts.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Sheshka&rsquo;s embarrassed splutter was cut off by a splat from the kitchen. As Sheshka peered in, Elysia buried herself in the young woman&rsquo;s skirt. Green paint dripped from a chair besides the paper-covered table.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Bookworm ladeee! Looks horrible, I messed up, Mummy&rsquo;s gonna be so <i>cross</i>...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Sheshka looked at the painting of the knight and the hydra. Elysia was a good draughtsgirl; the knight looked truly heroic with his thin black beard and unruffled smile. A stray pink smudge covered his chest, as if something had frightened the artist.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The hydra frightened Sheshka. The bulging limbs, tombstone teeth, the hair-like crest. All the flat, wailing faces. The alien intentions that clawed their share from the tiny life Sheshka had dared to hold. Thinking to grub her little share of warmth, without the courage to stand with a child against the dark otherworld</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;People can reach from other worlds, but not a picture by itself; Sheskha repeated it as she passed over a silent panic, and stroked Elysia&rsquo;s back.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Elysia...I believe you&rsquo;ve got a magical gate inside you. If you look through, you can see another world, that&rsquo;s just as you want it to be.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Uh...that&rsquo;s just imagining...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes, you can&rsquo;t go through the gate, Elysia. But you can always, always, look at the world you want to see, and not anything else. Um...should we finish reading the story, and see what happens?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; They sat under the table, and Sheshka finished telling how the knight stabbed the hydra through the heart, and rescued the princess. By the end, Elysia was making wet, hiccuppy laughs.</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like going through a magic gate when you read stories, Miss Sheshka!&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, your mother says I look through the gate, even when I could really walk through&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;&ndash;or when there&rsquo;s paint to clear up before it dries?&rdquo; Gracia, who had already snuck into the kitchen and cleaned most of the paint, put her arms around both girls&rsquo; necks. Sheshka&rsquo;s face almost burnt away.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, mummy.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry, Elysia, I love you too much.&rdquo; Her arm softly tightened around Sheshka, who let out a tiny sigh.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Elysia never said where her idea for the strange painting had come from. Sheshka and Gracia both wanted to throw the picture of the monster struggling with the knight away, but she decided herself to keep it.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p align=""center"" style=""text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">* <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The next week dissolved under work; until Sheshka could finally pull <em>Childe Harold </em>out of a stack, and read. Only her eyes and her breath moved; now slowly, then quickening.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;In paper-drowned nights, Sheshka sometimes believed she was living someone else&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;She&rsquo;d never expected to become a fileclerk&ndash;but it was a safe career where every choice naturally issued from every previous page, like a classic structuralist romance. After the pulp page of a murder tale had fallen between two leaves, however, Sheshka had imagined a girl who found and finished that other story. How the daily role of her life might appear to a Sheshka outside the books, in a role that excited and terrified.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Closing her book with a cat-like sigh, Sheshka hauled a pile of records onto her desk, calculating the reading time she would have after her work. She switched on the surplus military radio Kain had given her, for a more manageable distraction than her new Artugean playscript.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, Lieutenant Breda finished speaking.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;She was going to lose her job&ndash;where was Kain?&ndash;Colonel Mustang had killed Lieutenant Ross, and never visited the Hughes&rsquo; again&ndash;the government hadn&rsquo;t saved General Hughes from dying&ndash;if Kain had followed his hero, they would shoot him.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Sheshka kept writing.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;The High Command Meeting on the response to Ishbalan terrorism, Weds 16<sup>th</sup> March, 1915. Maybe the schedule she wrote would bear no relation to what was said. Maybe the meeting would never happen at all. Lieutenant Breda was frightened of dogs, Colonel Mustang dozed in his chair every warm afternoon&ndash;her pen was shaking&ndash;she could remember Kain&rsquo;s smile. Her memory cried out that the story she had been dreaming could not end with death.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><i>Dear Winry.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><i>&nbsp;What have you been doing? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been saving lives, or doing something heroic, or not just sitting at home. Elysia&rsquo;s well&ndash;she&rsquo;d love to see you again. Give my thanks again to the Elrics&ndash;they were really like wizards, magicking a timid bookworm like me among so many wonderful people. Wish you were here. We never even properly met, we&rsquo;re so different as well, but I know we could know each other, you could help me understand what to do with all my feelings, because I think everything that makes a woman good is in you, Winry&ndash;I can&rsquo;t write it, and nobody could.</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Sheshka stared at what she had written. It could be sent. She stared at her wall of books, the heaped worlds that roared in her perfect memory. From outside, every word was unchangeable, each story self-sufficient in its cover. It was easy to live like that, until there was red around Gracia&rsquo;s eyes or blood on your mother&rsquo;s sheets, until you had to know why General Hughes had been murdered, if Colonel Mustang had really been looking for that, and found it. You needed someone to hold you and be more than a stranger. Because stories could be scary, when you were alone, and people did things you didn&rsquo;t understand.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;How late was it&hellip;? No, the eclipse. Springing out of her chair&ndash;falling, books crashing down. The pressure.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Cuh..cuh...Kain.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;On the day Armestris would count its future years from, Sheshka felt nothing of Winry, the Hughes or Kain Furey in the howling mass of souls. But she would never regret the memory, because she knew that for an hour she had been one with all of them.</p></lj-cut><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;</p><br />"

The first character I first fell in love with <em>Mustang, the last Boy's Own Hero, the one and only</em><br /><br />2. The character I never expected to love as much as I do now <em>Alphonse. From a wishy-washy armoured wallflower, he just kept growing<br /></em><br />3. The character everyone else loves that I don't&nbsp;<em>Hughes. Just never&nbsp;that interested in him. Didn't find Greed especially cool either<br /></em><br />4. The character I love that everyone else hates <em>Who is there that everyone hates? I've heard Mei called a brat but surely no one could say that now, so Sheshka, who's not so popular, but a sweet character for what she is <br /></em><br />5. The character I used to love but don't any longer <em>Tringhams. Really not much to them<br /></em><br />6. The character I would shag anytime <em>Ahem...Riza has to be the nicest female character...</em><br /><br />7. The character I'd want to be like <em>Alphonse. Violence isn't his way, but he can use it; his best weapon is kindness<br /></em><br />8. The character I'd slap <em>Grumman, for continually acting like a twit<br /></em><br />9. A pairing that I love <em>Royai. The perfect couple, still seems so far away...<br /></em><br />10. A pairing that I despise <em>Roy and Winry. There's womanizing and there's...Allan Schezar<br /></em><br />11. Favorite character <em>Wrath. I'm a sucker for violent angry kids with cool hair, and he can be philosophical too&nbsp;<br /></em><br />12. My five favorite characters <em>After Wrath, Al (those two make a brilliant team), Roy, Ed (late mention, but the best charismatic, emotionally-akward lead), and Riza (ahem)<br /></em><br />13. My five least favorite characters <em>Grumman, Dante, Barry (Rather wierd, and as pathetic as most real world serial killers), Sloth, Greed<br /><br /></em>14. Which character I am most like <em>Probably Sheshka; book loving, easily distracted, but just trying to do my best<br /></em><br />15. My deep, dark fandom secret <em>I've written rather explicit WrathxWinry<br /><br /><br /></em><u>Wolf's Rain<br /></u><em><br /></em>1. The first character I first fell in love with <em>Hige. Even before the reveal, he was the coolest<br /></em><br />2. The character I never expected to love as much as I do now<em> Cher; from a plot functional scientist to a true woman. I don't need to say how much Quent grew over the series, and who knew Blue would even be a character?<br /></em><br />3. The character everyone else loves that I don't <em>Hubb. Someone had to be picked last, and its definately him. I don't like Tsume as much as some, he's a good character but just doesn't get so involved<br /></em><br />4. The character I love that everyone else hates <em>Who isn't hated by someone? I can see why some don't like Hige, but he's still himself<br /></em><br />5. The character I used to love but don't any longer <em>Darcia lost a lot as a character with his wolf transformation<br /></em><br />6. The character I would shag anytime <em>If I were a canine, I'm sure Blue would look/smell quite nice...</em><br /><br />7. The character I'd want to be like <em>Kiba. Evenwhen his faith gives out, he stays himself, and never, ever gives up<br /></em><br />8. The character I'd slap <em>Jagura, fairly easy choice there<br /></em><br />9. A pairing that I love <em>Hige and Blue, OTP. Similar to Royai with the straitlaced girl and the not-really-so-carefree guy, and the real emotional intimacy. Doesn't get any better.<br /></em><br />10. A pairing that I despise <em>Anyone else with Blue at all<br /></em><br />11. Favorite character <em>Hige, perfect sad clown<br /></em><br />12. My five favorite characters <em>Hige, Blue, Toboe, Kiba and Cheza<br /><br /></em>13. My five least favorite characters <em>Jagura, the soldiers, skateboarding guys, fallen wolves, daft owl<br /></em><br />14. Which character I am most like <em>Tsume, only with an apparently lighter exterior, and rather less toughness<br /></em><br />15. My deep, dark fandom secret <em>I haven't posted 9/10s of the Wolf's Rain stuff I've written<br /><br /></em><br /><u>Les Miserables</u><br /><em><br /></em>1. The first character I first fell in love with<em> The Bishop. I practically teared up reading through the first book, just from comparing it with the moral tone of most books I read<br /></em><br />2. The character I never expected to love as much as I do now<em> Gavrouche.&nbsp;The musical? Dickins?&nbsp;I've shat 'em, and made up a song about it</em>&nbsp;<br /><br />3. The character everyone else loves that I don't <em>Don't much like Marius, but is he even popular with anyone?<br /><br /></em>4. The character I love that everyone else hates <em>Not sure who's popular and who isn't...but I don't see that much fanfic about the Bishop<br /></em><br />5. The character I used to love but don't any longer <em>Felt some love for Cosette with all the gorgeous description of her emotions...but in the end, she was more a doll than a character<br /><br /></em>6. The character I would shag anytime&nbsp;<em>After all that description of their feelings for other people? Pass.<br /></em><br />7. The character I'd want to be like <em>Prouvaire. Love's going to save us.</em><br /><br />8. The character I'd slap <em>Colesqeous, for getting himself killed so stupidly, Mountparnesse for not listening&nbsp;to Jean, Marius' Grandad&nbsp;for being a&nbsp;wonderfully written daft git, everyone who did&nbsp;all that shit&nbsp;to Fantine, apart from Javert.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></em><br />9. A pairing that I love <em>Strictly as father and daughter, Jean and Cosette. Jean and Fantine if it has to be romantic<br /><br /></em>10. A pairing that I despise <em>EponinexMountparnesse, they clearly have no real feelings for each other<br /><br /></em>11. Favorite character <em>Eponine all the way. The finest two lines in the reams of text, the exquisite development, the perfect voice. Even in the musical and the anime, she's the best. But she just isn't going to get Marius.<br /></em><br />12. My five favorite characters <em>Eponine, Jean, Bishop Myriel, Gavrouche, Javert...I could really desend through the cast right now<br /></em><br />13. My five least favorite characters <em>Marius, Cosette's father, Bamboeis, the other two guys in the Patron-Minette gang&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></em><br />14. Which character I am most like <em>Jean's the everyman isn't he? His problem is everyone's problem, how to keep facing God in a shadowy world. Character-wise, I guess I'm more of a shy, earnest person like Mabuerf<br /></em><br />15.

I&rsquo;m never going to let you go.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;For a second Clare, did not advance, but her hand was on her sword, and the silver fire rising.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You might think I owe you everything, but I really don&rsquo;t. It was all from Teresa, even what I have with Raki. He&rsquo;ll forgive me, I know it...&rdquo; Clare&rsquo;s face appeared as calm and stark as the principle of revenge. &ldquo;You think because it&rsquo;s you, I&rsquo;ll show any mercy?&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;No. Joke? Ha...ha...ha&rdquo; Helen&rsquo;s whisper was only heard by Galatea.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Really didn&rsquo;t see this coming, kid?&rdquo; The nun watched the drifting hands, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve crossed a limit, inside their own heads. But neither one of them are wrong. And, dear oh dear, both stronger than m&ndash;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Miria was gone, Clare&rsquo;s cheek had burst. She turned, sword up. Stared at the lattice cut in Miria&rsquo;s face, her eyes and their shocking cold&ndash;she was gone and the force of their bodies rang.<br /><br /><br /><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal""><span lang=""EN-GB""><font face=""Calibri"">*<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp; </span><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>*<br /></font></span></i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;With every skill they held, or perhaps nothing but passion and limb-memory, the dark warriors flew over the ruins. Feet light as clouds, then twisting in the dust as the wall of steel thunder poured through. Their faces burned white, without tears.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Miria had the stronger yoki; even with her own released, Clare read it clearly. Miria&rsquo;s sword bounced back to smash a pillar; Clare&rsquo;s fell towards the place she would be, but she was through it, swinging at Clare&rsquo;s face, leaping above the quicksword to strike at Clare&rsquo;s head. She was taking cuts, if Miria had charged she&rsquo;d have been shredded, but Clare was tiring faster. &nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Sensing a burst of yoki, Clare twisted aside, sword weaving a rainstorm; Miria rolled beneath, firing a brutal kick into Clare&rsquo;s instep. Her face was monstrous, yoma-powered strikes batting the rapid dance of the quicksword aside&ndash;Clare had to block with full strength on the left, her back was open&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Clare wrenched her sword about, as Miria jumped back against a pillar and vanished. Clare&rsquo;s side exploded. She couldn&rsquo;t see Miria, she could sense the yoma, <i>coming&ndash;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Red dirt burst on Clare&rsquo;s face. She threw the quicksword around herself, until she slumped down, choking. A second wound had almost cut half-way through her chest.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You always had the techniques,&rdquo; Miria was saying, &ldquo;But your body cripples them. I can&rsquo;t read yoma like you do, but I&rsquo;ve fought for so long, I read nearly as much in your human soul. I know you, Clare&ndash;no one else better than you.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Nine years...and you think wounds make me give up? The pain doesn&rsquo;t compare.&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t give up. You never do...&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Yoma power blasted from Clare&rsquo;s body; batting Miria&rsquo;s sword aside as she leapt up&ndash;with control that made Miria catch her breath, she switched to a yoki-sensing level, dodging a phantom attack. Dodging another and swinging everything around like arc lightning.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust billowed from their feet, as they staggered back. Clare had another deep wound, but Miria&rsquo;s shoulder was carved away, her arm dead. Miria smiled faintly, as Clare turned, shining with the power of a death-or-victory strike.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re going to live,&rdquo; Miria&rsquo;s whisper was steel-clear, &ldquo;live for that boy&rsquo;s life, Clare....&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Clare snarled, dashed forward, tears shining in the roar of Yoki&ndash;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t die, Clare. You&rsquo;ll hear him over the ocean &lsquo;CLARE COME BACK!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Clare stopped. Miria&rsquo;s breath heaved in her ear, her Yoki was gone, her sword lying beside the arm Miria had silently cut away. Clare staggered back to the floor, breathing without air.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Yoki synchronisation. I could only ever have learnt it for you. You were...really, the strongest Warrior living. Just too human. Will you act as a human again, Clare? Or are you still not going to listen?&rdquo; Clare&rsquo;s lips were folded back like a mask, her tears were dumb. Somewhere, she was listening for a little girl that had never been able to scream. A thing that was not unyielding slipped through Miria&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Clare? You don&rsquo;t yield, I&rsquo;m leaving you here. I don&rsquo;t even want to say it, but it&rsquo;s needful. All I did for Deneve, for poor Tabitha, was what was needful; I never even tried to do anything else.&rdquo; Her voice was low, clear as iron, but not quite directed to any one person present, &ldquo;Cynthia, Queenie Hilda, Clare...I could fight, but I can&rsquo;t save you. Won&rsquo;t you come back?&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;Helen looked up at the white faces gathered in the ruins, above the courtyard where Miria was standing. The Phatom was black with dust and smoke, lost to triumph or any joy. Every Warrior left alive was watching, and all of them feared her. Galatea shifted her grip on her sword.</p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">&nbsp;<i>Miria. To this warrior, you were only a wall to overcome&ndash;but my wall, alone. Now you&rsquo;ve taken everything. I can&rsquo;t feel love or pain, in this silence. Just the fight...wounds don&rsquo;t end it, the girl crying inside doesn&rsquo;t make it stop. It&rsquo;ll end me. The prey creature who had life from Teresa and burnt it pathetically away, in weakness and pain. &nbsp;</i></p><p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><i>&nbsp;No. From the first time I fought Miria, I could feel something in me.&nbsp;Moving in the silence, fighting for my life...</i></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt""><span lang=""EN-GB""><font face=""Calibri""><em><br /></em></font></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt 14.2pt""><span lang=""EN-GB""><font size=""3""><em>*<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp; </span><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>*<o:p></o:p></em></font></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt""><span lang=""EN-GB""><font size=""3""><em>&ldquo;Clare.

"event","So there. Happy New Year to the world.

  2009 has been the PhD first year. I've taken a lot of skin off my hands, possibly made myself infertile, run miles of chromatography columns, poured out gallons of carginogenic solvent, learnt practically everything about running a Chemistry lab bench, become convinced that I know practically nothing about Chemistry, got an ambiguous go ahead for the second year against all expectations, and spent a whole conference writing the script for a Gunslinger Girl parody video. Overall, there've been more hard times than lighter ones, but under the circumstances things haven't been too bad.

  I'm starting to write in Livejournal again, practically from scratch, because I've wanted to write for some time, and feel like I can make a new start at this point, with a new way of living. Communication is a good thing to change."

"event","A week before the next exam, and no Uni activities yet, so I've had a little free time.<br /><br />&nbsp;Finally finished <em>Perditio Street Station</em>, and read through <em>The Great Gatsby;</em> the latter&nbsp;book really got through to me.&nbsp;It lost a bit of focus in places, but had all the famous sense of place, and the most satisfying tragedy. I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;tragedy appeals because&nbsp;bad things happen for a reason in it. I read this classic Sci-Fi novel called <em>Mockingbird</em> just today that&nbsp;I'd&nbsp;never even heard of,&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;Brave New World after the machines&nbsp;start breaking down. And where looking anybody in the eye is an obcesene invasion of privacy.<br /><br />&nbsp;On the Anime front, I've finally bought <em>Wolf's Rain</em>,&nbsp;because not owning my favourite series was getting stupid. And I managed to&nbsp;watch <em>Gunslinger Girl</em> as well;&nbsp;not as good or bad as the best or worse reports, but certainly&nbsp;a solid, appealling,&nbsp;outrageously short series. Next I want to watch a Samurai anime...and I'd like to invite some people to the Alpha course at Church, despite nearly everyone I know seeming to be Christian or Atheist, with no fence sitters to be seen.<br /><br />Organisation? None around here, mate...and hello to Almie again, missing you Exeter guys!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

Apparently we have a 'refreshers week' following, with more amateur sport,&nbsp;modified football chants and activities, and another Taekwondo grading three weeks after the start of term, just so&nbsp;the whole club can&nbsp;make Blackbelt inside three years.<br /><br />&nbsp;Two Taekwon-do guys also seem to be going on the 'tough guy' challenge for charity, an obstacle course involving flamethrowers and&nbsp;swimming pools. Just jingling a bucket would be enough fun for me;&nbsp;being the least&nbsp;fit person in the club and enjoying it just shows what charming people they all are.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Will restart that perenial Wrath fic soon, as well as any short stuff I get time for."

all three of us scared shitless about this competition.
first 7 questions we're tied with columbus east for first.
we miss question 8, we're second.
they miss question 9, we're tied.
tied until 15 -15
then we hit a slump
18-15. 
we start to get some of the harder questions right.
we tie.
19-19.
but because of tie breakers. we're in first.
last question.
lame lame lame ass question that none of us could answer confidently.
[now this is where i say we pulled it off, and we won and jumped up and screamed with joy....]
we missed it.
second place.
all three of us were devastated.
we cried.
it's still jazzy that we got second in state, but we all wanted first bad."

"event","Well if today wasn't the most interesting day of school for me then I just don't know what is. We had a bomb threat. That's something that I don't frequently speak about. Here's the story, well how I know it.

Yesterday, some fucktard called a bunch of random people and told them that a bomb was going to go off today at school. I guess he called trafficanti's mom who called the school and 911. And they also called mr. stewart. Which this is a funny story. Guess Stew was on the phone with his rents and the other line went off so he switched over and in a calm normal voice some kid said ""Tomorrow at 8:30 a bomb is going to go off with all the people in the school."" and stew thought it was one of his son's friends pulling a prank and said ""thanks"" and switched back over to his rents and didn't say anything to anyone. hah. so then what I hear from geo is that the school called the teachers and asked them to not come in until 7:00 am and Geo said the last time this happened was when they arrested Mr. Lindsey so he knew it was something serious but they wouldn't tell him what. So then the police came and searched the school... no bomb.

Well this morning I come to school. there's a ton of police. The bomb techs are there. the docta [alice neil] is there right in the entrance of the school. and they're checking all the students so that they have id's. Well I didn't know what the fuck was going on.. then I found out about 3 seconds later.. BOMB THREAT! AGH OMG! so I go to my first hour. nothing. second hour. naumo says this: ""i'm going to kill you if you cheat on the test. wait i can't joke like that. by the end of the day you might already get killed."" i thought it was hilarious. but still nothing happened. third hour. Kogs comes on the pa and annoucnes that they found the kid. that they researche dthe school and nothing was found.

Well now to the kid. It was Carey Ramey [sp?] supposedly the police handed him over to the FBI for questioning. He has 17 felanies charged against him. And he's going to jail if he's 18. Sucks man. 

Here's what I think. What a fuckin retard. did he honestly think he was going to get away with it? lame joke. no one thought it was funny. no one thinks your bad ass. you're just a fucking idiot. I hope the kid does go to jail. One less juvenile delinquent running amuk. Not to be mean, but seriously it's not like he wasn't bound for the big house anyways. I heard it cost fucking $10,000 to bring in all that security in today. what a waste. 

Another thing, what if this joker was for real? what if he really did have a bomb. No one personaly checked me. The kid could have had a pipe bomb in his damn baggy ghetto ass clothes and no one would have known. Why didn't we get school off? Why didn't they inform the teacher PRIOR to coming to school? If there was a bomb threat, i would imagine them freakin chekcing every damn person coming into that school for something. I mean christ, have you seen my purse? I'm not a crazy ass, but I could easily put weapons in there. And no one even LOOKED at my purse. Good thing I'm not psycho. 

anyways, that was pretty interesting.

 

Side note: My applications for the IU honors foreign studies program passed through the process.. so I now have an interview with Jacqline on the 20th. The final stage. I am so fucking happy and nervous bitches!"

"event","I woke up today at.. 10:15 and spent about an hour reading Chapter 11 for AP US. Last night Nic told me it was interesting, and I thought he was serious, but both him and Mike said that this chapter was probably the worst. As I was reading it today.. I liked it. I didn't finish it yet, but it actually is interesting. I think. I got a phone call from DQ asking if I was going to come in to work. I said yes. I didn't understand why they were asking me. Turns out I was scheduled to work at noon.. not the 6 pm that I had wrote down for some strange reason. Well it was 12:05 when they called. I was late. So I grabbed my uniform out of the hamper.. I didnt have time to wash it, so instead i wipped off all the blizzard crusties. I know pretty gross, and speed off the work. The whole way there I couldn't stop thinking about what Mrs. H was going to say to me. I was afraid to go into work. So I got there.. and it must have just been my day or something, but Mrs. H decided she wasn't coming in today. I had Alana and Toni as my managers [both like me a lot]. So we just shrugged it off and laughed about it. I got some good hours in today. I'm kind of happy I dont work that much in the winter because it allows me to focus on homework more, but I need the money. I worked 6 hours today so I was pretty happy. For"

1. You can press a button that will make any one person explode. Who would you blow up? George W. Bush. and then I would press the undo button and do it over and over again. bwahahahaha.

2. You can flip a switch that will wipe any band or musical artist out of existence. Which one will it be? Uncle Kracker OR Jessical Simpson.

3. Who would you really like to just punch in the face? Jayme Gaspar.

4. What is your favorite cheese? Munchie.

5. You can only have one kind of sandwich. Every sandwich ingredient known to humankind is at your immediate disposal. Bread: Italian Herb and Cheese from Subway. Meat: roast beef. Cheese: Provolone and Munchie. Vegies: Tomatoe, Lettuce, Onion, and a few Cumcumber slices. Condiments: Extra Mayo and light mustard. slighty toasted [enough to melt cheese]

6. You have the opportunity to sleep with the movie-celebrity of your choice. We are talking no-strings-attached sex and it can only happen once (they will never call you back). Who is it? Tom Cruise BEFORE the scientology. or Johnny Depp in his pirate gear. 
 
7. You have the opportunity to sleep with the music-celebrity of your choice. Same rules as above. Who is it? Scott Weiland or David Bowie [yes, i know they are old. ]

8. Now that you've slept with two different people in a row, you seem to be having an excellent day because you just came across a hundred-dollar bill on the sidewalk. Holy shit, a hundred bucks! How are you gonna spend it? CD's or books or a painting perhaps. 

9. You just got a free plane ticket to anywhere. You have to depart right now. Where are you gonna go? Italy. 

10. Upon arrival to the aforementioned location, you get off the plane and discover another hundred-dollar bill. Shit! Now that you are in the new location, where are you gonna go to spend that? something very vintagly italian and cheap.. because honestly just $100?

11. An angel appears out of Heaven and offers you a lifetime supply of the alcoholic beverage of your choice. ""Be brand-specific"" it says. Man! What are you gonna say about that? Even if you don't drink booze there's something you can figure out... so what's it gonna be? I don't know about brand specific... but I would go with some kind of nice wine that was more sweet rather than dry. High society right there bitches. 

12. Rufus appears out of nowhere with a time-traveling phone booth. You can go anytime in the PAST. What time are you traveling to and what are you going to do when you get there? Medieval Times so I can see men in shining armour OR the 70's. 

13. You discover a beautiful island upon which you may build your own society. You make the rules. What is the first rule you put into place? No prejudice of any kind. 

14. You have been given the opportunity to create the half-hour TV show of your own design. What is it called and what's the premise? Lei Unwraveled. It would be a reality show on my life. 

15. What is your favorite expletive? [while doing the 'suck it' gesture] and saying ""fuck it"". 

16. One night you wake up because you heard a noise. You turn on the light to find that you are surrounded by MUMMIES. The mummies aren't really doing anything, they're just standing around your bed. What do you do? Scream. Probably grab a pillow and attempt to break their brittle bones. 

17. Your house is on fire, holy shit! You have just enough time to run in there and grab ONE inanimate object. Don't worry, your loved ones and pets have already made it out safely. So what's the one thing you're going to save from that blazing inferno? My box of pictures. 

18. The Angel Of Death has descended upon you. Fortunately, the Angel Of Death is pretty cool and in a good mood, and it offers you a half-hour to do whatever you want before you bite it. Whatcha gonna do in that half-hour? Running around NYC seeing and doing as much as humanly possible with my closest family and friends. and then at the last minute.... free falling. 

19. You accidentally eat some radioactive vegetables. They were good, and what's even cooler is that they endow you with the super-power of your choice! What's it gonna be? Invisibility.

20. You can re-live any point of time in your life. The time-span can only be a half-hour, though. What half-hour of your past would you like to experience again? The last half and hour of the State Game with Nic Nik Dave Don and George. 

21. You can erase any horrible experience from your past. What will it be? (the answer ""nothing"" doesn't count. Hmm.. this is hard, I've never anything TOO horrible that I didn't learn a good lesson from. Well I guess the death of grampa, but then that would imply that he would never die. Which it is inevitable that he must, at one point die, so perhaps to prolong his death until I at least become someone amazing for him to be proud of me. 

22. You got kicked out of the country for being a time-traveling heathen who sleeps with celebrities and has super-powers. But check out this cool shit... you can move to anywhere else in the world! Italy. 

23. This question still counts, even for those of you who are under age. Check it out. You have been eternally banned from every single bar in the world except for ONE. Which one is it gonna be? I haven't to any [i'm 17 duh], nor do I know much about bars. So one that is fun and has lots of cool drinks and isn't a breeding ground for dirties. 

24. Hopefully you didn't mention this in the super-powers question.... If you did, then we'll just expand on that. Check it out... Suddenly, you have gained the ability to FLOAT!!! Whose house are you going to float to first, and be like ""Dude check it out I can fucking FLOAT!!"". like in air? Hell I would do a round trip of everyone I know. and the cloest person would probably be Nicole since she lives right over the railroad tracks.

25. The constant absorption of magical moonbeams mixed with the radioactive vegetables you consumed earlier have given you the ability to resurrect the dead famous-person of your choice. So which late celebrity will you bring back to life? Mr. Rogers. hands down.

26. The Celestial Gates Of Beyond have opened, much to your surprise because you didn't think such a thing existed. Death appears. As it turns out, Death is actually a pretty cool entity, and happens to be in a fantastic mood. Death offers to return the friend/family-member/person/etc. of your choice to the living world. Who will you bring back? Grampa. 

27. What's your theme song?
there is not one song. Perhaps instead a massive compilation of snippets of almost every song I own."

"event","Chapter 10 of AP US is quite boring. So what do I do to prevent myself from falling asleep?

I flip back to Chapter 9 and reread this passage:

""For the most part, the decline in the birthrate was accomplished by abstinence from sexual intercourse, by <i>coitus interruptus</i>(withdrawal of the penis before ejaculation),...""

Call me a child, but I find that rather comical. I mean here I was [this was last week] trying to cram in as much AP US history before I fell asleep and I stumble upon this passage and, i kid you not, laughed for a good 5 minutes. Needless to say, today as I reread this, it was still funny."

"event","Today officially starts the Christmas season and I am pretty much as happy as I can get. Driving to my gramma's we listened to 93.9... Christmas tuneski's 24/7 until January 2nd. :-)

Thanksgiving was hard. First major holday without the gramp. At first it didn't really seem so bad. Then we had dinner and all the turkey parts were on the big dish and every year.. Me and Gramma get the drumstick. My dad gets a thigh. My uncle and brother get the breast. and my mom and grampa get the wings. well we all had our food.. said grace. and there was a turkey wing left on the plate. My gramma offered it to us, but no one wanted to take it. So we ate and it was just quieter than usual. No yelling so that my deaf grampa can hear what we're saying. No jokes. No bickering between him and gramma becuase he sticks his finger in the gravy. So we ate and I did the dishes while my gramma ""cleaned"" the turkey. <i>well</i> while she wasnt looking, I snatched up that turkey wing, stuck it in ziplock, and put it in my jacket. Later on we went to the cemetary to put a wreath on his little plack thing and me and gramma started crying. Holidays are hard without the old man. Well, while we were standing there crying.. i got out that turkey wing and put it by his plack. I got the gram to start laughing. We went home and then put up my gramma's christmas decorations.. tree and all. I fell asleep on the couch watching Everybody Loves Raymond marathon.. then we came home. and here I am.

I'm excited for Christmas, but at the same time I don't want to have it without him. I'm ready for snow, and songs, and lights, and spirit. But i'm not ready for the empty chair, an extra turkey wing, the ham that we cooked just for him, and the slippers we wont buy for him this year [for every christmas as long as i can remember, we always got him slippers, the same kind too. and he like replaced his old ones with them]

I'm stuffed and that turkey chemical is starting to kick in again [had a turkey sandwich not too long ago] So i may go nap. 

Happy Thanksgiving guys.

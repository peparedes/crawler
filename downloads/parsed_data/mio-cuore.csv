Next weekened Im going into brooklyn and Jessica and I are going to get our nails and hair done... WOOO HOOOOO!!!!!! GIRLS DAY!&nbsp; I think im going to get layers again. who knows.&nbsp; But shhh im not telling too many people because then it wont be a suprise.. im one of those fcuktards that likes to go do stuff and have it be a suprise.&nbsp; I hope things keep moving smoothly they way they have been.&nbsp; I'm happy despite my emotional couple of days this past week.&nbsp;"

<center> I was just looking at a bunch of pictures and thinking about a lot of memories~ I was once in love and i no longer cry about it.  Then i have been sitting here thinking about my crazy cousin who i love so much.  Im so happy that shes having fun.  i think im changing.  i just cant believe im moving in august and its finally starting to hit me and i just want to cry because im nervous and im scared im going to lose the ties i have with Jessica, Andrea, Santiago and many more people.  I know i wont be able to get rid of lisa~ HAHA JK!  I miss Giuseppe and i havent talked to him in over a month and a half and it sucks because when hes here we chill and have fun then the second he leaves its all over AGAIN!  Io non ho capito perche io sono pazza~ i want so much outta life but the scary part is that all i really want is a husband and kids~  if a select few ppl were to get down on one knee and ask me to marry them i would say yes in a heart beat... then we would make beautiful italian babys~ lol~ im nuts i know~"

<marquee> these are the tears i cant fight back... <3 </marquee>
<center>And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cuz I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cuz sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

And I don't want the world to see me
Cuz I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am

"event","Well a chapter has ended and a new one is begining!  I am officially done with R.R. i wish no never see his face for as long as i live and i know its possible!  Im stronger than to allow him to screw up my life anymore than he has already!  I am so much stronger and better than to allow someone to rule my life when they do nothing but bring me down in every possible way.  true friends dont do that to eachother i dont care what you say. but anyways...

THATS RIGHT IM GOING DECEMBER 15th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   its such a rewarding feeling to know that you arent benig held back by anything LIFE IS GOOD!  all i gotta remember is both LIFE AND LOVE GO ON!!
<font color=""pink"">
And on and on and on and on 
and on and on and on and on 
and love goes on and on and on 
and life goes on and on and on 

When I was with you I was 
always happy and I 
Drempt of promises you made to me 
Now I see you holding hands 
with another girl and I 
I cannot understand why you 
Would ever leave our love behind 

Love can set you free, sometimes its meant to be 
and love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on 
Love can make you mine, sometimes its so unkind 
but life goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on 

And on and on and on and on 
and on and on and on and on 
and love goes on and on and on 
and life goes on and on and on 

Maybe we're not meant to be 
together now I see 
Never be the one I love...forever 
It was not okay for you 
to be untrue and lie to me 
Dont think that you'll get another chance 
Cuz you've already lost the key 

Love can set you free, sometimes its meant to be 
and love goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on 
Love can make you mine, sometimes its so unkind 
but life goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on 

And on and on and on and on 
and on and on and on and on 
and love goes on and on and on 
and life goes on and on and on

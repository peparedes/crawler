I don't know what to do..I'm confused.Lost pretty much.I just sit there in a damn chair and look into space with a pretty smile.No one can understand that I am forgotten.I seem to be a nothing when people don't want anything, and I'm actually a person when they want something.Only my family and my best friend Kayla are close to me.

I feel like putting labels on myself.Every circle would be something else.

Liar, faker, sad person, I tried to cut and I couldn't go through with it several times, bitch, unnoticed, nieve to my surroundings, nieve to me, blind, forgotten, people don't know me, and I don't know myself.

All of those labels cut my bones into my soul and they wrap around my heart.There's always room to change.I hope I can change.Make big steps in my future to happiness.I know I'm only a teenage drama queen, 15 at the best, but I know what I want to be and what direction I'll take.People keep saying I have a way with my words to.Just the hardest part is to change a one way process.I underestimate myself all the time.

My mind changes all the time.My judgements change, and I just follow what people say, but then all these other people say things.I don't know who to believe. :|I feel like I'm going to go crazy...

Well, I'm done blahing about stuff. :) Byeeee."

I don't know what to think anymore.Can you blaim me?I'm still finding myself, and some people just don't understand that.I hate it when people space out on me and misunderstand me.I see from two versions of a story, and I like to get facts from most things before I start blaming someone.Come on though, let me be a damn teenager.I want to make stupid decisions, except for having sex and doing drugs.But I do want to be regular old me, not have a chained soul and have someone expect me to grow up fast.I'm still a child at heart.I'm not ready for anything like that shit.

I'm tired and I feel like being buried in the ground.I feel so odd.Exhausted right now.I'm tired of pointing fingers, but I continue to do it anyways.My train of thought always tends to slide anyways.

Lies, lies, and more lies.Deception, we deny.There just might be a more world than us teenagers can ever know.Even adults.We all seem to want to go in the same direction, but ther's more answers that we don't see.Not just one way.Because of one person, all my friend lost his hope and I might as be the silent one who doesn't know a god damned thing, but he can't just sit there and say I know nothing of pain, and not knowing him.He didn't ever let me in, and I doubt he will now since I pointed out the damn truth to him.Even he needs someone, but he can't fully give out everything to one person.Does he even know how to branch out?Probably not.This is only my view, though.There's always two sides to ever story..

Will I ever get myself out of shit?I need a friend, and I thought he would be the one to save me from myself..I was wrong.I was so totally wrong.I decieve myself so much, and it makes me so aggravated.It sucks that I had to go through anything, and it sucks he puts himself through that as well.We all lie, but he reached a breaking point where it just made me snap.I got angry and was yelling at him, he doesn't understand me either.I'm human and I do have emotions to.Guess I'm just another person to him.It's also my fault of my own pain and I see it clearly.I'm trying to change it, but my effort goes unnoticed.Should I fall down and grieve?Should I let myself fall into my own hell and give in? No.I'm too stubborn, but I am in a lot of pain...

The sweet masses of dead bodies I see.Interesting dreams I have.All the time, sad and painful.Lonely.Like a desert with nothing in it.Only an endless waltz of death and blood.

I can't seem to smile truly anymore, I can't seem to walk anymore on my own two feet and be dependent of myself.Shall I say I'm not a very happy camper right now?

God, saying camping like that reminds me of that hot boy that kept staring at me. *blushes* I swear I've seen him from somewhere...>_< I just can't put my finger on it..D: I would love to meet him ago.He sparks my curiosity.There's cute boys and there's hot boys who spark my curiosity.The ones that spark my curiosity make me feel better to be with. :D Really, it does.It's better to go with someone who I'm curious about and get to know them better.If they are just cute, I'd just go out with them and it probably wouldn't even last a week.

I feel odd talking about that.Now I feel like a giggling school girl.A bubble head.Everyone in there life goes through the girls and guys stages though. ^_^ It's a part of life that will never go away.It stays.I know things change, but I don't think teenage years of finding boyfriends and girlfriends ever went away. ^_^

I need a bath.I'm so tense and worked up. :( I don't like feeling like this at all.I don't think anyone likes being stressed out a lot.It's why little things push me off the edge, I'm not good under pressure at all."

I don't want love, I told my friends I wanted a baby and crap, but I realized I wanted something more for myself, like loving myself.Not having someone baby feed the love to me like everyone else has.

I need to stop being such a negative person, but it's kind of hard not to be like that since I've been so negative for such a long period of time.If only I could make myself take a break...

I'm so selfish, aren't I?I'm blind, selfish, and stripped from my soul.Everyone is at one time or another, right now is my time to bitch.Be angry, selfish.I've been trying to make everyone else happy, everyone else see me as perfect.I'm done with that.I'm done with everything.

More teenage angst and bitching.Yey, the likes of completely nothing.It'll all be gone when I grow up, but I have the right to say anything I want.It's called freedom of speech, and I think I'll use that to my advantage...*nods*

Again, I am having problems eating.I can't sleep and I'm up all night, swallowing myself in the pain of loneliness.Maybe I should write another poem and post it on scopie again.Aren't I just another regular teenage girl with a stupid silly crush?

I know I have huge dreams of being something when I grow up, but the problem is I'm stupid as hell and I must be smart to get into a college like Saint Francis.I'm striving to be a poet and artist.I'm spacey like that, and I'm outcasted in the social life for being a weirdo.

I miss Kayla, I love her so much.More than the eye can see, since me being bisexual doesn't help me at all.I am never going to tell a single soul in real life that, for they will stare at me strangely.Nothing wrong in having a little secret here and there.It's actually quite nice to keep something to myself, instead of being used by my cousin Jennifer some more.Or maybe I'm just to, what do you call it, overly dramatic about things?Runs in the family if I am.

Today is odd.I hate myself for some odd reason.I just want to scream, cry my eyes out, and just fall over and die.Dying isn't the right thing though, and I know that.I'm also tired of living though, I'm tired of it...

Go around and talk to people about these illnesses while looking like I'm an ass.Perfect job choice for me.

"event","She walked around coldy,
without a care,
every few minutes,
getting a stare.

All she could think of,
was being alone,
all she could feel of,
was feeling so cold.

Her thoughts smeared with dismissel,
tainted by the lights of mere missels,
only to fear,
of beginning to tear.

All she could do,
was happily scream I love you,
all she could see,
was what she turned into.

The beauty of ice she was,
only to begin the life of another,
seeing as she could do nothing more,
just fall to the floor."

"event","Wow, awesome.Sad again today.Once, again.I see the blood on the windows.I think I may finally be going crazy.Kind of scares me.Well, not really.Seems to me that people don't notice I'm not myself anymore.All I have to do is sweetly smile and then I get away with everything.Sad really.

I did nothing today, again.I just sat and stared at the computer for more hours.Eyes hurt now and I have a headache.What else am I supposed to do when I have no life?I don't know what to do; so I just listen to more sad songs, stare at screens all day, and hope that someone I don't really know gets on and chats with me.Oooh, maybe play video games?

I'm sinking myself in some deep crap that I don't even know.The other day Kayla made me call random boys, since I've never had a boyfriend before.I don't think she knows it really, but that really boosted my self confidence somewhat.I have slim to zill self confidence, ya know.I'm not a very pretty face to die for.I'm just another average girl.Must I always be this weird?

Well, I'm going to go.Maybe I'll rant tomorrow.Or if I stop being lazy, maybe I'll finally get a life and never come back.Wouldn't that be great, huh?"

For one my grammar is such ""wow"" makes me look stupid and for two I don't even go to that school any more. But any ways. Allot has happened sense then. New School. New friends. New life style. Yep, things took a turn for the worse but then gradually got better. But any ways. I  think I'm gonna go update this thing."

While you<br>have always had extreme potential, a recent or<br>not so recent crisis has given you a taste of<br>dark magick-and you love it. The rush is<br>addicting to you and you just can't seem to<br>stop. Whatever reason you had before is not<br>important, and the only important thing now is<br>the drawing of power. Whether it takes the<br>deaths of plants, animals, humans- it just<br>doesn't matter to you anymore. They mean<br>nothing to you now. The moon as always held<br>special signifigance for you and it is eveen<br>more so now- especially the full moon. Although<br>you have that unhealthy attraction to human<br>sacrifice, people seem drawn to the dark vibes<br>that resonate from you. You are feared and<br>hated, loved and worshiped by all- and that's<br>just fine with you.

I guess it's a good thing<br>that you have so many. You are very popular and<br>very loved. You will put your friends first and<br>yourself last. You are friendly and loyal to<br>your friends.

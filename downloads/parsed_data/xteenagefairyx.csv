Or that I could just change all the bad things about me to make myself perfect. 

I guess the reality of it is I'm just not perfect, I'll never be and I can't always make everyone happy."

"event","I've been told by a lot of people that I should write a book of rules for dating. I know I'll never write a book, but I'm going to start my list right here. It's going to be ongoing, so keep checking this post for updates. 

Sara's Dating 101

1. You should almost always make the first move when sexual activities are involved. I say almost because sometimes girls want to be vixnes and prove that we like sex too, but if you start it, it makes the girl feel so much more special. It makes her feel like she's wanted.

2. When a girl says she loves you, don't respond with 'whatever'. 

3. No matter how tired you or her are, a phone call to say goodnight and I love you should always be a must. Seeing it typed over AIM is not very meaningful. 

4. Opening a car door or holding a door open whenever you two enter a building should be a frequent act. Sometimes even pulling out her chair at dinner is called for. 

5. Buy her cards. Birthday, Valentine's Day, anniversaries, even just to say you care about her. 

6. A single flower of her favorite one is more romantic than a dozen of a kind that's not her favorite. 

7. If you know there's an event -- concert, movie, play -- that means a lot to her, go with her. Even if it's not something you'd enjoy, it'd mean a lot to her and making her happy should make you happy.

8. Mention her in your profile. It may seem stupid to you, but it means something to her. And if you're doing something with her, have it in your away message. Instead of just 'Dinner' have 'Dinner with *insert name here*'. 

9. Offer to drive when you go out on dates.

10. Call her. It doesn't have to be lengthy conversations, just call to say hi or that you were thinking about her. And by all means, when you say you'll call, actually CALL HER.  

11. If you promise something, try your hardest not to break it.

12. When you say I love you, always make sure you say 'I' love you, not just 'love you'. That one letter means so much more to a girl then you will ever know.

13. At a restaurant, always tell the hostess your name, number and seating preference. Don't make her do it. 

14. If there's something that she likes a lot, like a certain flavor of a candy, make her a bag of just that flavor. For instance, she likes orange Runts better than any other kind. Go through boxes of Runts until you get enough orange ones to fill a box or sandwich bag. You don't have to do this often, once would be enough. But, it would really show how much you care. 

15. The little things always matter, always. 

16. Stay in with her at least one night every few weeks. Cuddle, watch movies, make dinner, do anything you want. Just show her you enjoy spending time with her alone.

17. If she likes bubble baths, make one for her. If she's had stressful day or week, buy her bubble bath, light a few candles in the bathroom and let her relax in the tub. If you can get in there with her, do it. If not, be waiting for her after and give her a massage or just lay with her. 

18. Even if you aren't the best cook in the world, cook her a meal every now and then. 

(From Tiffany)

19. If you're having a fight and she walks out/drives off/goes to hide in another room, FOLLOW HER. 

20. If you're having a bad day, don't keep the bad stuff from her--she tells you, she wants to know in return.

(Me Again)

21. If you're mad for some reason, no matter if its because of something she did -- tell her. Even if its something stupid, she'll still want to know. Whenever you're mad girls automatically think it's their fault, so clearing up her worries would make things better.


Ok, that's all I got right now. Trust me, there will be more. If you have anything you want added, just comment. <3"

"event","I am so in love with that quote. *The title to this post.* There's more to it, but I just don't remember. It's from Peter Pan the book so, now I really want to read it. :)

Well, hi hi! I'm alive, I promise. I know I disappeared for almost 2 months. It's been crazy with school starting and moving and all. I don't really have much to say. I need to start updating regularly and I promise I will soon. 

Ok, for the highlights of what's happened the past 2 months...

-- My birthday was August 19th and it was a great day! Pictures shall be posted soon so I'll let you all know.
-- Chad took me to see Green Day for my birthday....fun, fun time. I <3 him.
-- I took Chad to see The Bloodhound Gang and CKY this past weekend for his birthday. It was a lot of fun and a good trip for us. CKY was absolutely amazing! It was definitely the best show I've ever been to in my whole life. We were right in the front, like I was leaning on he barrier the whole show. Phil, Ape, and Pop Pop were there. Chad caught one of Jess's drumsticks, I shook hands with Jess and Matt, and a few guys from The Knives were videotaping the whole show and Chad and I are definitely on this thing a good 20 times. I am really curious as to what they are doing with it because I really want to see this tape. haha I was looking completely sweaty and gross but, I had the time of my life so I know I looked happy on this thing. ;)

That's about it other than school starting and doing rush events for ZTA. Our last party is Thursday and Bid Day is Monday so, we'll have new girls soon. We got Big Brothers last night which was awesome. I'm excited because we got some really great guys and I love all of them. :) But, I gotta run and get to class. School sucks and it's running my life. 

<3

P.S. -- April, I've finished the 3rd chapter, I just have to type it up. I've been sitting in class writing it in my notebooks for the past week. I'll email it to you with the rest of it as soon as I get it typed. *hugs*"

Three random things people don't know about me...
[1] I dream in color.
[2] When I get bored or am concentrating really hard, I chew on the inside of my mouth. 
[3] I want to spend the 6 months after college living somewhere where I've never been on my own. Taking a friend would be the ideal situation, but if I have to go alone, then I will. 

And following the tradition...

"event","I was just looking back on old entries and I found this quote from a book I read last summer...

""If you were happy all the time, how would you know you were happy? You have to have unhappiness to know what happiness is."" -- Moi 

I never realized how true that is. 

I just don't know what to say anymore. I have all these emotions and they are all fighting to get out, so many words to say and I don't know where to even start. I feel like I could explode any minute into a mix of laughter, tears, and screams. I can't even pick a mood right now because I don't know. There's too many inside of me and no single one is winning over the other. 

I just want to escape to my own little fantasy world to get away from it all... 

Or cuddle up in my bed with a can of frosting, my bear, and my blanket. <3"

Since you disabled comments, I saw what <lj user= ""requiemoflove""> did and I copied her. hehe I know you said you didn't want answers, but it's a bad feeling to just sit and wonder all the time. I just wanted to let you know. I knew you'd see this so yes, you would be terribly missed if you weren't here!

List five songs that you are currently digging. it doesn't matter what genre they are from, whether they have words, or even if they're not any good. but they must be songs you're really enjoying right now. post these instructions in your blog along with your five songs. then tag five other people to see what they're listening to. 
01. ""Guilty"" -- The Rasmus
02. ""Familiar Realm"" -- CKY
03. ""Heartache Every Moment"" -- HIM
04. ""Lost Boys"" -- The 69 Eyes
05. ""Beautiful Disaster"" -- Kelly Clarkson

Anyone notice that three out of five of those songs are from the Viva la Bands cd? I am so obsessed with that cd right now.

So, how's everyone doing? I've been a little lazy in updating lately, so I figured it was time for a real one. My last few days of work for the summer are closing in. I'm going on leave from the 20th of July to the end of August sometime. I have to go home since I won't have a place to live because of the apartment move-out and move-in dates. Mom and dad moved in their house yesterday so, I'm excited to go home to a real home. It's the first time I've had a real home since last August and I'm looking forward to it. Class will be over on the 29th and I have my midterm tomorrow, a paper due Monday on a book I haven't finished, another book to read and write another paper and another test before the final. Summer classes are good in the sense that you only have one class to work on, but they move so fast and you have a test every week and so much to do. I don't like that they are so busy, but I guess it can have it's perks. 

Chad was supposed to come down this weekend, but the chances of him coming are starting to look slim. I'm not happy. I know I can't expect him to come whenever I want him to, but I'd been planning on him coming this weekend since before he left after Summer I. This was supposed to be my best weekend of the summer...Chad coming to visit, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' comes out on Friday, the new Harry Potter book on Saturday...but, now I might not have my boyfriend to make my weekend fun. At least Meg's birthday is tomorrow and she's having a party on Friday night so, I'll get to celebrate with her. That should be fun. :) 

Speaking of Chad, I've planned out his birthday present. I found out that CKY is doing a show at The NorVa in Norfolk on Sept. 11th. Even though it's on a Sunday, I decided that Chad and I can go do to Norfolk on Friday after class and spend the whole weekend. If it's warm, we can go to the beach or go to Busch Gardens and just spend the weekend together. Then on Sunday, we can meet Joey and hang out all day then go to the concert and then drive back to Radford after the show. I asked him about it last night and he sounded excited. He said it was a great idea and it'd be a good birthday present. I'm sure by then I will have enough money to go and besides, two tickets for the CKY show are cheaper than one of our tickets for Green Day. Which our Green Day tickets for August are Chad's birthday present to me and he says he's getting me something else, but I really don't want him to. Those tickets were $90 and that's more than enough for him to spend on my birthday. I'm already making my list for my parents though. So far, I'm only concerned about getting a laptop. They said it would be joint Christmas and birthday which is perfect. I just need a new computer. I really want a satellite radio subscription or an IPod, but I guess I'll just have to see. I hate the radio because of commercials and stuff and I figure that either one would be great investments/gifts for me. Just hopefully I can talk my parents or my brother into helping me out with it. There's also about a million cds/dvds that I want for my birthday....Laguna Beach Season One *I'm a dork, I know*, Love Metal Archives Vol. One *I'll just have to suffer and watch it on my computer*, all of The 69 Eyes cds, The Rasmus' new cd, CKY3 since it's the only one I'm missing now, and many, many more. The only way I'll ever get all the music and movies I want is if I win a shopping spree to Amazon.com or something. haha Which will never happen.

It's time for me to go study for my midterm before work. I close tonight and tomorrow night so, I'll only have a few hours to study after work tonight. Love you all! <3"

I know very little about some of the people on my friends list. Some people I know relatively well. Some of you I hardly know at all. Perhaps you lurk, for whatever reason. But you friended me and I thank you.

But here's a thought: why not take this opportunity to tell me a little something about yourself. Any old thing at all. Just so the next time I see your name I can say: ""Ah, there's so and so...she likes office supplies.""

I'd love it if every single person who friended me would do this. Yes, even you people who I know really well. Then post this in your own journal.

"event","I feel so bad for what happened in London today. It's really shocking and I feel like this should tell us something. I just feel so unsafe anymore. I mean, the incident in London heightened our terror alert in all the big cities and I just feel like you can't go anywhere anymore without having to be worried that there's going to be some terror attack. 9/11 caused this same sense of fear in me, I didn't want to leave my house. But, then it was different because I was in West Virginia and I didn't know anyone who lived in any big cities or near any big cities. Now that I have so many friends that live in the D.C. area...to think that an attack may happen there and someone I know, a friend or even my boyfriend, could get hurt, it's really scary. I just hate all this. All this fighting and war and terrorism...it's scary. 

My thoughts are with all the people of London."

But, we love each other and I know we can make it through not being around each other for awhile. Even though it's planned to where we're seeing each other almost every other weekend which really isn't all that bad, but it still feels like forever. Ugh, listen to me complaining. I really shouldn't complain so much...there are people out there is way worse relationship situations who have to go longer without seeing their significant other. I should just be glad that I have such a wonderful boyfriend who loves me. I love saying that, he does love me. He really does. :D This past weekend was awesome! I met some of Chad's family, we went out to eat, went to the Great Falls Park, spent lots of time in his pool, and just had quality time with each other. We both really needed to see each other so the whole weekend just made things better.

Well, today has been rather uneventful. Mom and I went to Beckley to get vanity tops for the new house and we went to the new house like 3 times. It's coming along really nice. It's the total opposite of anything my mom's ever had in a house except for the red dining room. I really like the style though, especially the black wrought iron lights. It's the closest thing to gothic anything my mom will ever have in her house and the are gorgeous. I talked her into letting me bring all my bedroom furniture to the new house when I move to my new apartment. She's going to give me her antique iron bed and let me spary paint it black and buy some old dressers and stuff and fix them up how I want. I can't wait! My room will be even more awesomely pink and black. *giggle* I just can't decide what I want to do behind my bed in the new apartment. I really want to buy these canopy rods to hang on the ceiling at the four corners of my bed and they make it look like a canopy bed. I think it would look really awesome since I don't have slopped ceilings like I have in my apartment now. Speaking of my apartment, I am so excited for my new apartment and the things I am getting for my walls! hehe I am buying a bunch of black frames and turing a lot of pictures into black and white to match the whole decor. Plus, I have my Moulin Rouge picture, my black and white Audrey Hepburn calender, and I hope to get a couple really cool architecture posters to hang up like the Eiffel Tower or a castle or something. But, I finally got a frame for my pink Razorblade Romance album and it looks awesome! I can't wait to hang it up and see how it's going to look! Plus, I might do this idea I got off Trading Spaces on the bottom half of my walls. You take ribbon and make stripes to where it looks like stripes painted or wallpapered on the walls. I think it would look awesome with black satin ribbon creating the stripes and a polka dot around the middle of the wall to create the divider. I don't know yet, that's a lot of ribbon and a lot of money I don't have. 

Wow, I talked a lot about my room...sorry for those of you who didn't want to read that. :P

You guys want to know something I realized today? I really want to tape a bunch of music videos and learn the dances. Like Green Day's ""Holiday"" and MCR's ""I'm Not Ok""...not to mention the many rap videos that have good dance sequences like 50 Cent's ""Candy Shop"" and the new Missy Elliott video to the song that I don't remember the name. I guess I'll just have to get a blank tape and then have <lj user=""hippiechick13""> to learn the Holiday dance with me. We'd both love to know it all and I know she'd do it with me. And to anyone who's seen both...aren't there parts in the ""I'm Not Ok"" video that are very much alike some parts in the ""Time Warp"" sequence from Rocky Horror?? I get reminded of RHPS everytime I see that video and I want to to go watch it immediately. hahaha Gotta love cult musicals about transvestites....I do! :D And Tim Curry, he was so hot back then. And he's not bad for a gray-haired man now. 

Ok, enough mindless babbling from me. Love you! *muah!*"

<lj-cut text=""50 Things to Know About Me"">

3. When I get stressed out, I sing at the top of my lungs.
4. If past lives are real, I think I must have been a kitty. Or a fairy.
5. Even though I doubt it will ever happen, my dream job is to be a wedding planner.
6. I love the stars and the way it feels to be outside at night, but I'm secretly scared of it. I hate to be alone when it's dark and I hate to go outside alone at night.
7. I think I'm a closet OCD freak. I don't do things in odd numbers or anything like that, but I have certain ways of doing things and I have to do it the same way all the time...like how I fold towels and the order of how I get ready and what I do in the shower.
8. I love Cher and have since I was like 2. 
9. My feet are my favorite body part.
10. I have an obsession with the male back and male hip bones.
11. I cry at least once a week, if not more.
12. I secretly wish I was one of those Park Avenue Princess-type girls that wears all designer clothing and goes to all the swanky New York clubs and parties. Except I wouldn't be stuck up and mean to everyone.
13. I love photography and wish I had the money to buy a really nice camera so I could take pictures of everything that I see.
14. If I go outside in the sun sometime during the day I'm automatically in a good mood.
15. I chew on the inside of my mouth when I'm bored or deep in thought.
16. Even though it's one of the hardest subjects in the world for me, I'm actually kind of interested in science.
17. I want to learn how to do things in Photo Shop. Really good things.
18. I have somewhere around 10 journals that I've kept over the years. I save them all and sometimes I go back and read them just to see how much I've grown and changed.
19. I have practically every single note that has been given to me since the 5th grade. I have three big storage containers full...there's notes, movie tickets, everything and anything that holds a memory for me. And I remember what every little thing stands for.
20. When I was in 7th grade, me and three of my friends wrote possibly one of the best stories in the world. If it hadn't of went missing, I would have probably submitted it as a screenplay.
21. My dad has had a motorcycle since I was in elementary school and I've rode it once and it was less than a mile. It scares me.
22. I'm almost always worrying about something.
23. I want a little kitten so bad that I can't stand it.
24. I would love to do a lingerie photo shoot one day. Even if it's just playing around.
25. Fried pickles are one of my favorite snack foods and I can only get them in Richmond.
26. I met Vitamin C and she did a special concert at my high school when I was in 10th grade.
27. When I was in high school, I used to skip school but I never left school. I just hid in the music room.
28. I have a fear that I'm losing one of my best friends. 
29. There is one person that knows me more than anyone and she is also the one person that I feel the most comfortable around.
30. For once, I feel like I've finally found real and lasting love.
31. I sometimes wonder how my life would be different if I grew up somewhere else, or if I had different parents. Not that I don't love my parents because I do. <3
32. One day I want to drive across the country. I want to start out and drive through the north, go from Washington state down to the end of California, then drive back through the south. I want to go to as many states as possible.
33. My other dream trip is to backpack through Europe. I have a list a mile long of all the things I want to see and do.
34. Most people want to spend their honeymoon on some exotic island...I want to spend mine in a castle in Ireland. In a room with big floor-to-ceiling windows, a king size canopy bed with velvet drapes to close everything out, rose petals and candles everywhere, and 'Kissing You' from Romeo + Juliet on repeat.
35. I will also walk down the aisle to 'Kissing You' instead of 'Here Comes the Bride'.
36. I have almost every detail planned of how I want me wedding...even down to who I want as my photographer.
37. I have an affinity for gothic design and architecture.
38. I've been planning a photo project in a cemetary for years. I just can't find a cemetary around here that speaks to me and gives me the feeling that I want my pictures to convey.
39. My model for this cemetary project when I find the right one will be Tiffany. <3
40. I wish that all my friends will always be happy and I would do anything in my power to make them happy.
41. Most people know this, but I love country music. It just makes me feel so connected to where I'm from and the southern culture I grew up in.
42. I love vintage and retro clothing...the 20's, 50's, 60's, and 80's are my favorite generations.
43. My favorite poet is Edgar Allan Poe and I could read his work for hours on end. And I love imaginative writers like Francesca Lia Block. Reading is one of my biggest passions and I love being able to sit down and read something and be transported to another place; especially places that seem like a fantasy.
44. I love food and am always hungry. I can eat more than my boyfriend sometimes. 
45. When I have my own house, each room will be a different color and more than likely, a different style. I have a secret room planned for my house that will completely be a mattress...covered with pillows, silk and other fabric on the walls, and a ceiling that will be like a planetarium.
46. I regret quitting ballet when I was younger. And never taking gymnastics until 8th grade.
47. I love show tunes and songs from Broadway musicals.
48. When I step on a stage, I feel at home. And my dream is to be on Broadway one day.
49. Even though people make fun of it, I love West Virginia. It's so beautiful and natural here.
50. A good friend in high school once called me a 'Closet Goth'. I believe him. 
</lj-cut> 

Wow, that took longer than I thought. There's so much more...maybe I should do one of these a month. But, a little mystery is never a bad thing. hehe ;)"

Stolen from <lj user= ""obsidianslasher"">

Step 1: Pick 10 movies you like.
Step 2: Find a quote you like from each.
Step 3: Post and let everyone you know guess what movie the quotes come from.
Step 4: Cross out the quotes when someone guesses correctly.
Step 5: DON'T GOOGLE THEM


1. ""Who knows where thoughts come from, they just appear.""
2. ""I love you."" ""Say that again."" ""I love you."" 
3. ""Let us in, let us in!"" ""Let us out, let us out!""
4. ""Maybe this is some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.""
5. ""And even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that I'm forever changed because of who you are and what you've meant to me, which -while I do appreciate it- I'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.""
6. ""Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.""
7. ""That's why I'm here. That's why I'm going to let fate take me anywhere it wants to go, because when all of this is over, atleast I'll never have to think of him ever again. Let's just pray he's a bald Fascist who picks his nose and wipes it under the car seat.""
8. ""There's nothing like a woman's scorn for Sega.""
9. ""But why is the rum gone?""
10. "" 'Anarchy in the UK', what the f*ck is that? What good is that to those of us in Utah, America? It was a Sex Pistol thing. They were from England, they were British, that's what they did. They were allowed to go on about anarchy in the UK. You dont live your life by lyrics.""

Ok, a lot of these will probably not be guessed, but oh well. Good luck! :)

"event","Finals were invented to make our lives hell. Enough said.

All I want to do is sit down and have a good cry. Unfortunately my nose is so stuffed up that I might suffocate to death if I cry too hard. 

I have two finals tomorrow. Religion at 9 and Biology at 2. I have a 62.7 or something like that in Biology right now. My teacher lost my extra credit assignment and when I actually think that I did decently on a WebCT assignment, I get a 60%. I thought that I might do ok on this final, but now I just feel completely worthless and am scared to death that I'm going to fail the final and the class. Religion is like learning a completely new language in two weeks. I get so confused that I don't know what words mean what and what weird names go with what religion. I think my brain is on overload. My Media Writing final is Tuesday at 8 p.m. That's the only one I think I'm going to do pretty well on. Writing's always been my strong point and it always turns out that the stories I think are crap are the one's I get the best grades on. I turned in an extra credit story on the Green Day concert that I wrote in seriously, 15 minutes. Several people read it before I turned it in and said it was absolutely amazing and I should submit it to a real magazine instead of just as an extra credit assignment. I hope I get the full 25 points on it though. That would make my life. I have Media History on Wednesday if I even decide to take it. If I have a B or C in the class then I'm not taking it because some people took it early and said it's the hardest, most bullshit final they've ever taken in their lives. So, needless to say, I'm a little stressed about it if I do have to end up taking it. Oh well. Enough complaining.

I'm just ready for summer. Even though I'm taking two classes, they aren't difficult and they will totally help boost my GPA. Plus, they are the two classes to start my minor and I am super excited for Intro to PR. I think it will be fun. 

But, I'm just ready for really warm weather. Flip flops, tank tops, bikinis. Booze cruises and tubing down the river, porch sitting, tanning at Bissett, *hopefully* going to the beach, and *really hoping* going to NYC. Not to mention seeing Revenge of the Sith and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I just need to relax. 

Tiffy, come visit me before I go insane!!!! You always make things better. I love you! <3

Ok, time for more studying. Religion here I come. Byebye loves. <3"

Not to mention that it's with Tiffy <lj user=""hippiechick13""> and Zac and Chad and I am sooooo excited I can't stand it! :D

Sorry I for the lack of real updates lately. I know you all probably hate me but I promise a HUGE update when things slow down a little. But, for now...I'm leaving you all with a little something to do...

If you want to play...
1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me.""
2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions and leave the answers as comments on my LJ.
4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post. 

<lj-cut text=""My Interview from Tiffany> 1. I remember a whole lot but one memory that really sticks out is when we first moved in our first house in Abingdon *I was like 3 or 4*, we only had plywood floors and when dad came home from work I was playing on the floor acting like I was a kitty *hehe that's so me* and I got splinters all in my knees. My mom and dad both had to hold me down while I bawled my eyes out so they get them all out. 

2. I love the freedom. It sounds bad, but I really do. And I love that I keep meeting new people who have so much in common with me...it's like going somewhere where you are guaranteed to meet at least 5 people who have something in common with you.

3. Viva la Bam and The O.C.! :D Oh, and of course American Idol! 

4. I love wearing flip flops and denim skirts. hehe Oh, and now that I can, I love wearing ZTA letters!

5. More than you will ever know, sweetie! But, you'll be here in August!!!!! I can't wait!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D </lj-cut>

For now, I'm off to take a nap before work...<3!!"

Yup, I'm sitting in class right now. We're not really doing anything besides writing a couple news stories and they are really easy ones so, it's not a big deal. But, other than sitting in class, being back to school hasn't been that bad. The weather has been B-E-A-utiful! Flip-flops and my jean jacket so make my day! We've officially started Kidnapping Week but, so far, I haven't been got. Unless it happens tonight since I am sitting in my class with a Sigma Chi and he did get my Big last night, so who knows. My pledge class got Brett on Sunday night when we got back so, that was fun. I felt bad though because he ended up getting more wasted than we expected. And completely covered in sharpie and dry erase marker. Not to mention we painted his fingernails and colored in his toenails. hehehe We're evil little Alpha Taus! Our payback will be bad, I can feel it. lol 

Ugh, I want to go to bed but I have another hour and 15 minutes left in here. I'm going to go busy myself with some other things <3!

P.S. -- I think I've finally figured out what to do with my life...I'm going to go into Public Relations. I can make it my minor and be in something that's fun and high profile. Most of it involves planning things, so it could potentially lead into wedding planning. :)"

"event","Spring Break is officially over tomorrow. :( Part of me is sad because I honestly don't want to leave my mommy or go back and have to do work. haha But, the next month is going to be so busy and I have so many awesome things to look forward to. I honestly I have something almost every weekend until the end of the semester. And it's not like just one night/day out of the weekend, it's like everyday. Let's look at the schedule...

- Starting Monday is Kidnapping Week with Sigma Chi ending with a mixer on Friday night. 
- April 2nd is Zeta Day in Roanoke. I'll be there all day long for a convention with all the ZTA Chapters in VA and the night before we are hosting these ZTAs in Radford so I could possibly have 3 or 4 girls that I don't know staying at my apartment. When I get back from Zeta Day, Chad and I have to leave to drive to Abingdon for the race on Sunday, the 3rd. Go to the race, come back to Radford that night.
- On Monday, April 4th, Greek Week stuff starts. I will have to go to games and performances and stuff every single night.
- April 9th is Initiation.
- April 16th is Quadfest...not to mention the alumni coming in the night before and the Shindig concert that I might go to at Longwood is on the 15th.
- April 22nd is the Green Day concert in Norfolk with Tiffany and Zac. CAN'T WAIT!!!! Like Tiffany said, there's nothing better than your best friend, your boyfriend, and Green Day. hehe We'll leave Norfolk on the 23rd coming home and as soon as I get back I have to rush to get ready for banquet which is that night. 
- Week after that...last week of classes. That weekend is Relay for Life. 
- First week of May...FINALS! :\

That's just my schedule minus homework, classes, and work. Not to mention anything else for ZTA that gets added in in chapter, new member meetings, and being Ashley's Rush Assistant. Plus, I still have to work on memorizing the Creed for Initiation...I've only got two lines out of 12 memorized so far...NOT GOOD! I am seriously going to have the busiest last part of the semester of anyone that I know. It's going to be insane! Not gonna lie, most of it will be fun, but I will be ready for a break by the time finals are over. And then it will be time to start Summer I. Oh well, I'm going to Bike Week in Myrtle Beach with my parents *hopefully, Chad will go too! :D* and that will be my vacation to rest up from the last part of the semester. 

Anyway, today was an interesting day. Mom, dad, and I went to Charleston and got some shopping done, etc. I definately saw a lot of people that I hadn't seen in awhile. I saw Jesse, Hilary Hardman and her mom, Justin Allen, Steve McGlothlin, Julie Atkins and Justin, Ashley Jarrett, a few people I knew from Teen Board, Kristen Bryan, and I think that's about it. haha There were definately a lot of people there. Oh yea...I saw Casey. I walked past Game Stop and glanced in and he was working...he didn't see me I don't think and I didn't go in and say hi. I figured it might not have been a good idea and plus, mom would not have been happy. haha Jesse seemed to be doing really well and of course he helped me out at AE and gave me his discount, which I love him for! <3 And I finally found the BAM hoodie I have been obsessing over since Christmas!! I was so excited and it was on sale and it was perfect!! :D I can't wait to wear it when I get back. hehehe  

Wow, this has gotten pretty long and I should probably get some sleep since I have to get up early tomorrow to pack and drive back to Radford. I'll try to update during these crazy weeks that are about to become my life. Love you all! <3

P.S. -- WVU beat Wake Forest!"

"event","I love when my favorite movies randomly come on weird channels on tv. hehe Empire Records is on right now and it's just put me in the best mood! <3 Not to mention that I'm talking to CHAD!!!! :D He just got home today from Panama and we'll all be back together at Radford on Sunday. I wish I could have went up and spent the rest of break with him, but I knew mom wouldn't let me drive alone. I'll get to see him Sunday though, so I'm happy! :D

I went shopping with mom today. Yea, I know, I go shopping all the time but I really did get some cute things today. It's about that time for me to go through clothes and get rid of them again so, I'll be starting that when I get back to my apartment. If any of you want some clothes, let me know! lol I am seriously going to have to downsize because of my room size next year compared to how huge it is this year. So, lots of things will get either given away or packed away in boxes for awhile. I hate having to keep things in storage. It really feels like a part of you is missing because your personal belongings are packed in boxes somewhere. Like say if I wanted to run and look at my yearbook from 7th grade to read something that Tiffany wrote in the back, I couldn't because it's packed away in a storage building in Abingdon. I think that's really sad that I can't have those things with me. I'll have it all with me someday.

Ok, I'm going to go search the internet for a white dress. That's all I lack in the clothes that I need for sorority stuff and they seem to be nonexistant in any store out there. So, internet shopping, here I come! <3!"

A few entries back, you all may have noticed how excited I was for Valentine's Day. Well, let's just say it wasn't anything special. Chad and I did go out to a really nice dinner and then hung out all night but neither of us really had the money for good presents or the time to organize something really good. So, we decided that we are going to make up our own Valentine's Day. A day that is only for us that we celebrate like the normal V-Day. Only, it's going to be more special because it's something that we make up, a day unique to us, a day that the whole world isn't celebrating on, and a less commercialized version of a day that you're supposed to show love to your significant other. We haven't picked the day yet, but it's going to be sometime in the next part of the semester. I just need to know what to do on this day. I know it's the purpose is so it's all stuff unique to us but, I need a little input here. Some hints, cute ideas, just stuff like that. I want to put some major planning into it so it's something that neither of us will ever forget. And we're going to celebrate on this day every year so I want to start something. Like a little tradition that we can continue every year...I just don't know what to do. So, this post is made strictly for comments on what I should do. I need your help, people! hehe <3! 

P.S. -- Check out the icon I used for this post...I thought it was appropriate considering that Chad has this shirt. hehehe :P"

"event","1.What does your LJ nickname mean?
  - It's related to one of my favorite books by Francesca Lia Block and I absolutely love fairies! 

2. Elaborate on your icon photo?
  - It's a combination of two of the most beautiful men *in my opinion* and I am a fangirl of both. 

3. Did you lie about your age anywhere on the net?
  - hmmmm...maybe back when I was like 12 or something. lol

4. How many LJ friends do you have?
  - not really sure, never counted

5. What is your current status?
  - taken by the most wonderful boyfriend in the world! *giggle!* And I love him! 

6. What are you wearing right now?
  - A striped t-shirt polo thing and jeans

7. What is life to you?
  - A wonderful experience that just keeps getting better. :)

8. What is love to you?
  - Pure, untouched beauty. 

9. What kind of people do you hate most?
  - Fake people who try to pretend to be something they're not or people that intentionally cause harm to others or people who judge too quickly.

10. What type of people do you like most?
  - People who are genuinely good and honestly care about people and the type of person that will listen and not judge and just be there for you to make you feel like you are special no matter what.

11. What makes you happy?
  - Friends, family, love, being with Chad, writing, a good poem, a good picture, music, singing, dancing....ok, wow, a lot of things makes me happy. hehe

12. Are you musically inclined?
  - I guess after 2 years of plain chorus and 3 years of Show Choir I could say I'm a decent singer....I love singing and I love to listen to music so, I guess that helps too. 

13. What would you do if you woke up one morning and found out that the person you love most didn't exist or was killed?
  - Thinking of things like this scares me....I don't know what I would do. That's a shock that most people don't ever want to have to live through. 

14. If you could go back in time and change ONE thing, what would you change?
  - There are a lot of things I regret, but most of them made me who I am today and overall a better person. Although, if I had to choose, then I would probably say a certain situation my junior year in high school would have ended differently.

15. If you MUST be an animal for ONE day, what will you be?
  - A kitty. :)

16. Ever had a near death experience?
  - Thankfully, I can say no to this.

17. Name ONE obvious personality quality you have.
  - I'm usually always happy.

18. What's the name of the song that's stuck in your head right now?
  - Actually, none right now which is hard to believe.

19. Are you happy today?
  - Yes. It's been an overall relaxing day and that's what I needed the first day of spring break.

20. Who will cut and paste this first?
  - hahaha Probably no one."

"event","As everyone else packes and gets ready for awesome Spring Break trips to beaches and warm weather, what am I doing?? Packing for go spend seven days in the coldest place on earth. Yea, I'm stuck going home for break so, I'll be in ""Little Alaska"" for the whole week watching it snow and be freezing cold. Can anyone sense how pissed off I am?! Well, not really because I'm not incredibly pissed but, it would be nice to be going somewhere different. Everyone else is so excited for break and I'm actually dreading it. I don't get to start break until Saturday night because I have to work an 8 hour shift on Saturday but, then I'll be going home. I want to think that maybe mom is feeling bad and has planned a trip for just me and her but, I honestly doubt that'll happen. She has a hair appointment next week *so, I'll probably be in Abingdon for one day, Tiffy* and stuff so she won't want to cancel any of her plans to do something with me. 

Oh well. I'll stop ranting. I feel totally selfish after saying all that. I'll just have to make the most of my week and at least I get to hang out with my mommy. :)"

We got our big sisters yesterday and I got Lindsay Clark! Sooooo happy about it! I'm in the Fish family too so, it rocks! hahaha I'm sure none of you care but, I'm totally happy about it so I just wanted to share. I was rereading my list entry and completely forgot to mention what I'm doing in April. I'M GOING TO SEE GREEN DAY!!!! April 22nd I'm going to Norfolk to see them with Tiffany, Zac and Chad. I am soooo excited about it! It's Tiffany's first Green Day concert and I can't wait to be there with her for it. It's going to be awesome. hehe :) Ok, this is a short entry because I really don't have much to say. <3!


P.S. -- I thought I was going crazy today when I was walking across campus because I thought I saw Ville Valo...yea, that's right. It wasn't really him but some kid that obviously goes to school here and looks EXACTLY like him. Very, very creepy."

"event","hehehe I told you guys I'd update eventually....well, I finally have the time. Things have been very hectic lately to say the least. With classes and ZTA, ok mostly ZTA, I've been busy 24/7. Work has kinda sucked in general considering my hours have been dwindling from week to week. Last week, I had only 8 hours. This week, only 4. Four measly little hours for a whole week is not even enough to pay for the gas that it takes me to get to work and back. Do you think that's fair?? I don't. Oh well. The search for a new job will be put into full effect this weekend before I even consider quitting Target or giving my notice. I would like at least a good prospect or even a new job before I quit there. Even though a job is the last thing I really have time for right now. Zeta is taking up soooo much time! I mean, I'm not complaining or anything....I absolutely LOVE every minute of it but, it's just a lot more than I expected. Every week my planner is full of things to do....meetings, mixers, sisterhoods, service projects, rituals, intramural games....but, it's the most amazing thing that I've done here at Radford. The acceptance that I have received, the friendships, the fabulous girls, it's all so fantastic that I will recommend it to everyone! I know, sorority life isn't for everyone but, there is also a typical stereotype that people think of and ZTA is not that at all! Yea, we have our fun but there's not that stereotype of ""you're a pledge so you have to get completely wasted or you're kicked out"". There's no hazing, no belittling and making us feel like less of a person because we're ""pledges"", no slave duty, nothing like that at all. It really is just an amazing group of girls that are purely in it to gain friendship and sisterhood and it's fabulous! :D

Ok, I'm off my soapbox now. I didn't really mean it to be like a rant or anything, I just really wanted to stress that my organization is not the typical thing you think about when you hear the word 'sorority'. We are a social organization but, still....it's different. 

Anyway....I think that's about all that's really going on right now. I did have plans for Spring Break, but those got cancelled unfortunately. Chad, Hoey, Jesse, and I were all going to Daytona but, transportation was a huge problem so we all just decided not to go. Instead, I think I'm going to visit Chad the first half of break and then going home for the last half. Visit mom and dad and maybe get to Charleston for a day, who knows. I wish I could go to Abingdon but I don't know what mom is doing. It's snowing so much up there in West Virginig right now that I don't know if I want to stay there or not. lol 

Well, it's past 1 a.m. and I do have an 11 o'clock class in the morning and a whole day at the library to look forward to. So, I think my bed is calling my name. Plus, Chad will be home soon....and I'm in the mood for some :x or :X. hehehe I promise to try to update more frequently. Now that I have to have 5 study hours a week, I'm in the library a little more and I do tend to get really bored so I could start updating every day in there. Just remember I love you all! <3"

"event","SNOW!!!! Finally, it snowed around here and it wasn't just stupid little snow, this was good snow. Excpet now snow day was involved, but I don't really care for snow days anytime in the following ten days. Why you ask? Spring Recruitment '05 officially started last night which means I can't drink for 10 days. Not like it's that big of a deal or anything, I would just have an extremely boring snow day compared to my friends. lol But, I'm soooo excited about rush! :) I just have a feeling about spring going so much better than fall did. Fall is just so disorganzied compared to spring and I think spring gives you such a better chance at actually getting to know the girls in the organizations and finding where you really want to be. I'm just going to be VERY busy from now until the 30th and VERY stressed! We don't get bids until Sunday the 30th and these next ten days are so intense that I will be ready to scream come Saturday night. It's like one thing after another and they aren't short things, they are like 9:30 in the morning until like 10 at night. It's going to be fun though and the outcome of all this will be something so awesome that I can't even imagine it. :) Honestly though, how many of you would have pictured me being a sorority girl? lol Oh well, this is something that I really want to do and I'm extremely excited about it. 

Classes are starting to pile up. Thankfully, this no drinking means I probably won't go out and I'll actually be so bored that I'll have nothing else to do but homework. hahaha My Media History class is really irking me though. It's the same professor that I had for Media Law but, he seems so much more disorganized this semester. *I've really noticed lately that I have a complex with disorganization.* He never explains anything and he rambles and rambles all through class. Nothing he talks about has anything to do with media history and it's just so annoying. I actually make the effort to go to class and then I sit and wonder why I came the entire time. I've done good with attendence so far this semester. I've only missed one class so far. I'm very proud of myself! :) I'm definately going to try to go to more classes this semester because I really want to make the Dean's List. I know I can do it, it's just actually doing it that's the problem. lol I know my parents would be really happy if I did so, I might work extra hard just for them. They deserve a little something to be proud of me for. 

I'm getting excited for Valentine's Day! Anyone else?? hehe I'm planning a dinner for Chad and I even went so far and corny as buying dinner plates that are pink and red with a heart design on them just for us to eat on. *I know, I know...don't make fun of me!* I'm just really looking forward to this holiday this year for some reason. I think it's because Chad and I are so awesome together. I honestly have never had a boyfriend that I enjoy spending time with as much as him. I never get tired of him, no matter how long we spend with each. It's really great and I know I talk about him a lot, but hey! I have a right! lol I FINALLY have a good, healthy, pleasurable relationship and I can talk about it whenever I want! Ok, enough of a rant. :P Back to V-Day, I just need to come up with some cute ideas for some things I can do for him. Looks like I'll be getting creative once again! ;) Doing stuff like this is what I enjoy though, so I just hope he appreciates it. I'm extremely romantic and I guess it can be a flaw but, Chad hasn't complained so far. 
 
This has gotten pretty long and I need to go get ready to go to Roanoke and shop. :D My favorite activity! lol Much love, byebye! <3"

"event","Well, second semester has started. I honestly don't think it's going to be that bad. Bio will, without a doubt, stress me beyond belief and I will want to kill myself, but my other classes don't seem too horrible. Media History will probably be a lot of work but, most of it will be busy-like work and not anything too stressful or hard. Religion seems like it will be fun. *I know, I know...a class, fun??* My teacher is hilarious and really laid-back, so I'm sure it will be the least boring of all my classes. I don't have Media Writing until tonight at 7 so, I've yet to know anything about it. I am not looking forward to it though. It's from 7-10 on Tuesday nights and it's really not going to be on my list of favorite classes. True, it's only one night a week and I'll get it over with but there's just something about being in class at 7 o'clock at night that I am really not excited about. Hopefully, since it is taught by staff we'll never be in there the whole three hours though. That will make it better. haha 

The last part of my break was a lot of fun. I haven't got to fill you all in on it yet so, here goes. As you know, I was at Chad's for 6 days! :) It was a lot of fun! I swear, that's the most time I've ever spent in the presence of someone and A. never fought and B. didn't get tired of each other. I could have honestly spent the entire break with him and been completely happy. It was really weird coming home afterwards and not having him around, but HE'S HERE NOW!!!! Yup, he got to come back! Things worked out well and his parents gave him a second chance and he's back with me at Radford. I couldn't be happier! It just really made things better coming back and knowing that he was going to be here. :D He just makes me really happy, I can't even begin to describe it! 

Ok, it's time for me to go and clean....I've been here since Saturday and never really finished unpacking. I have clothes EVERYWHERE! Much love everyone! <3"

"event","Ok, boredom got the better of me and so I decided to go ahead and make a real update. It's really been awhile and now, here I am sitting in a freezing cold house in Summersville, West Virginia. My parents are all moved in and I've been here since the beginning of break. Only a week now and I'll be back at Radford starting classes and getting a whole new batch of stress. I'm really not looking forward to this semester. To start with, I have a pretty hard schedule and my classes are going to be so time consuming that I doubt I'll even have time for work. I'm going to try to work and I'm even still considering sorority, actually I really want to do it, just the time constraints are finally starting to settle in. Earlier I wasn't so worried about the stress because I knew I would have someone to help me deal with it all, to comfort me but, Chad's not coming back this semester. It still hasn't sunk in and I haven't really thought about all the times I'm not going to have him around. I just don't know what I'm going to do when I start missing him and I could normally just call and he'd be there in five minutes. But, her I am being the selfish one. He's going to have to be at home, going to school there when I'm pretty sure he'd much rather be at Radford. I'm sure there will be times when I'll be around all the guys and they will help keep my mind off the fact that he's not there but, he won't have that. I'm sure he's hurting just as much so, I can't honestly put myself before him. Luckily though, I might be going to see him tomorrow. All I have to do is wait for my dad to say yes and I'll be meeting Chad tomorrow in Friendsville, MD and going home with him for a few days. I'm really more excited than I am can say. I can't wait to be able to see him tomorrow, cuddling and kissing and just being happy with each other. There's a certain comfort I get from cuddling up next to him that I don't really get anywhere else. I'm comfortable in places, but it's a different kind of feeling. A much better feeling than any I've found with anyone else. I just hope this semester apart doesn't take some kind of bad toll on our relationship. It's so new and so great right now that I don't want to risk messing it up. It's just some bad kind of fate I guess that we are being put through this test of sorts so soon. Ok now I'm getting mushy and sentimental...but, I just don't want things to go wrong. I'm just going to stop thinking about it...it upsets me. 

How was everyone's Christmas? Mine was pretty good actually. I spend some time with most of my family and got tons of presents. hehe I have so many movies now that I think I'll be watching them for months. The O.C. Box set *yes, I got it! :D* will keep me busy for two days almost. Not to mention the Friends Season One Box Set. Plus, I got Tony Hawk Underground 2 and that will be very addicting, I have a feeling. I'll probably start playing that and give up Kingdom Hearts for awhile. Even though the second one comes out this spring I think so, I need to hurry up and beat the first one. I didn't get a white Christmas, but that's fine considering the amount of travel we did in such a short time. We had to make all the regular stops at the respective families and it really did make it feel a little more like Christmas. But, actually this Christmas felt different. We didn't have the big family thing at my house and we didn't have the Christmas Day huge dinner. And with moving it just felt.....different. Not real, not like a normal Christmas. Christmas is all about family though and I did have my family, but it wasn't like it usually was. Hopefully next year will be better.

Ok, what is it with all this sad stuff? I'm being so down when I really shouldn't be. haha I think I'm going to go watch some tv and be lazy as normal. ;) <3 and kisses!"

"event","Hey everyone! I know it's been awhile, ok a LONG time since I've updated but I really haven't been using this prized little journal as much as I should. With school and now work I barely have time for anything. I work at Target now for the sheer reason that I needed a job and I needed the money but, it's not the most unpleasant job in the world. The people are nice and the atmosphere is a little hectic at times, but not insanely unbearable and the pay is good. Well, not excellent but better than I could get at most places. I have pretty good hours and they actually give you the breaks that you are promised so I guess it's about as good of a job as I could ask for right now. I get my first pay check on Friday so, we'll see how good it's going to be. haha 

First semester is almost over...it went by so fast! I can't believe that I am getting ready to be a second semester sophomore, almost a junior. People weren't lying when they told me that college goes by extremely fast. The sad thing is, I don't know what I want to do anymore. I went into college so sure of myself and what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and now I'm starting to question it all. Don't get me wrong, I love writing and I love the idea of my working at a magazine someday but...that someday is a long way off. It takes so long to get where you want to be in the world of journalism and I don't know if I want to wait 10 or 15 years to make a comfortable living. Yes, I know every job takes time and you don't just start out at the top but, other jobs are easier to work your way up in. I have so many ideas in front of me...law school, possibly pharmacy or even being a wedding planner. I would love to be a wedding planner...or maybe an all around event planner. But, again I run into my parents and family not thinking that that profession will provide a comfortable enough living for me. I know money isn't everything and they say that too...but I want a profession where I don't have to worry every month if I can make ends meet and that I have enough money to pay all my bills plus do things that I want to do. I don't want to have to scrape just to be able to buy a new shirt when I want to. Sadly though, this is what happens to a lot of people once they get out of college. They end up getting a degree in biology and working as the manager of a Denny's. I want to be able to get a job that actually relates to what I go to school for and allows me to live comfortably. It's so strange to have to think about these things...think that you'll have to support yourself instead of being able to rely on your parents for most things. It's scary in a way. I'm so scared that I'll make the wrong decisions or end up in the wrong job. I just wish there was some test I could take that would say ""This is your job and this is what you would be good at"". But, you have to figure it out for yourself and no one can tell you...and I've never been good at making important decisions. I just want to make my parents proud of me in the end of all this. After they pay so much for my schooling, I just want them to know that I made something out of myself. I'm going to start researching things. Jobs, professions, where I can get with certain degrees, etc. There's so many things out there that you don't even think about until it's too late and I want to know all of my options and possibilities before I make a serious decision. 

Ok, enough of that. It's Thanksgiving and we're supposed to be happy and thankful for all that we have. I am definately thankful for my parents and all they have done for me. I'm here in Roanoke right now at my brother's. My parents are in between moving again...yup, another move...what's new? This time they are going to Summersville. At least they'll be closer to me and I'll be closer to my friends from high school over the summer and stuff. I just wish they would settle somewhere. This is starting to become ridiculous. lol I have to work tomorrow and Saturday which will not be fun. Can you imagine the craziness that will be Target the day after Thanksgiving?! haha Someone pray for me! 

I've done a little Christmas shopping but I haven't gotten all of it done yet. I still have a couple more people to shop for and a few more things to pick up for a few more people. Including Chad. I'm almost clueless as to what to get him. I've already gotten him a couple things but I want to do something extremely special for me. Something that will make this Christmas together really memorable. If anyone has any ideas, please help me out! Casey was so easy to shop for...you bought him anything that had anything to do with Nirvana, The Crow, superheros or guitars and he was happy. I'm not saying that Chad's not easy to shop for it's just that we really haven't been together that long and I don't know what to get him that would be special yet something that he would really love. I could always go the route of making him a cd for my sentimental gift but, then again that's not exactly original anymore. Everyone makes cds for people now. I guess I'll have to put a good amount of thinking into this. lol 

Well, I'm going to go and help mom out a little with dinner. I can't wait to have good home cooked food! :D I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving! <3

"event","I am lacking in commitment right now. I am a sack of homework and writing, and yet when I&nbsp;get inspired by the art of the path I left behind I'm so quick to throw it all to the way side and muse and obsess over the beauty that I&nbsp;used to be able to create, long to create it again. Maybe I&nbsp;need to include that in my life, but maybe I need to commit somehow. Otherwise the ideas are half assed and get no where. Maybe I&nbsp;need to turn away from performance-based works, but find something that still exploratory and progressive.

I'm thinking site specific photography/short film:&nbsp;Bodies and Landscapes."

"event","This Summer will be intense!&nbsp;I am going to be doing a full course load, one distance, one intersession, one summer session, and one regular. <ul><li>EDUC&nbsp;315 - Individual Differences in&nbsp;Language Acquisition</li><li>PSYC&nbsp;388 - Biological Rhythms and Sleep</li><li>PSYC&nbsp;354 - Development of Children's Thinking</li><li>CRIM&nbsp;104 - Something about criminal behaviour (it's a breadth credit)</li></ul>And I&nbsp;have two classes with the lovely miss sophie, hopefully we'll be able to pool our studying efforts and get maximal grades with minimal work. <br /><br />I'll also be taking one of the children I&nbsp;work with to some preschool programs for a month, which should be cool. I also dropped two of my commitments, and am taking on another family for different experience/more pay. It's a no lose (except for the families that I left)&nbsp;situation. <br /><br />I'm at odds at what to do about the rest of my degree:&nbsp;Douglas college is offering a citation in ABA/Disability which can be transferred to SFU&nbsp;and count towards my degree.&nbsp;In the fall it starts and goes year-round for 3 semesters. I could do that concurrently with my remaining SFU&nbsp;coursework and have one semester left in fall 2011 to finish up my degree. The only downside to that, is that I&nbsp;will be very busy and won't have a ton of time to work, which means that I won't be able to acrue many certification hours and will have to wait longer between finishing my coursework and writing the board exam to be a BCABA (associate behavour analyst). If I&nbsp;delay the douglas coursework, I&nbsp;could probably finish off all of my SFU&nbsp;courses by Fall 2011 and then start the coursework while working a little more intensively. So basically I have to decide if I want to have no life and be done sooner but get less supervision, or if I&nbsp;want to take a little longer but work more. Honestly I&nbsp;think the first one is better, because once I&nbsp;graduate even if I'm still gaining the supervision hours I&nbsp;can work as a b-level consultant anyways. Besides, maybe I&nbsp;wont even want the certification then after all. <br /><br />ok. end rant, back to studies."

I&nbsp;will be 21 in three days, excitiiinnggg!!! Although&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I've been cheating because in all the research participation I've had to do for my psyc class I've been writing 21 instead of 20 on the questionnaires. Just feels more accurate! Come on year 21, I am ready for yooouz!

At any rate, today I decided to see if turning on the light would activate the heat and, lo and behold!&nbsp;Warmth.

"event","I don't even try writing about life anymore. I feel like since I can't do it justice, writing about it just makes it seem bleak. 

I went to my second contact improv class. I was very nervous and timid at first. It's hard for me to be in such an unfamiliar environment, when I am much more inexperienced in the skill being practiced than everyone else. Especially since it involves interacting with others by means of that skill set. But if felt so good to listen to my body and move how my body wanted to move, and slow dooown. I was hesitant to move into contact with the others, and the first few attempts were feeble and awkward. But later on I&nbsp;saw an interesting opportunity. A man was moving towards me, along the edge of the marley and making a play on the linear line with his body. I&nbsp;actively did the opposite; swirling, swooping and low motions. And when we met, while still awkward at times and in need of negotiation, it flowed beautifully in moments. Instead of trying to get &quot;on&quot;, we were actually dancing together, rarely breaking contact. we started slow, my hands in his, making shapes, moving into and out of the floor. There were pauses when we were stuck, but by listening we could flow through. We picked up speed, arms making more intricate shapes, legs moving more quickly, taking up space in the room. I&nbsp;began to grow tired, and eventually broke away to go sit with the experience. It was intimate, and yet with a total stranger. I&nbsp;have never spoken a word to him, except for one &quot;sorry&quot;&nbsp;and one&nbsp;&quot;it's okay&quot;. I don't even know his name. And yet what we created was so painfully beautiful, the memory of it is still dancing in my head. 

This is what I've been searching for; dancing for dancing's sake, and dancing in a way that calls for surrender."

I&nbsp;needed nailpolish remover so we hit up the london drugs then went down to the skate park with builder, les and joel. Pretty uneventful but it was fun to skate again.&nbsp;Apparently&nbsp;I can still kind of ollie. wuuutt! 
Then they went for dinner, but we had just had breakfast, so we went grocery shopping and met up at their place later on for some beer and foosball. 
Came home at 9:30 ish to find alexx had made dinner!&nbsp;Watched skins, drank some wine, went to sleep.

Pretty good as far as v-days go. Although we did have an intense what is the meaning of love?&nbsp;convo in the morning and talked about OUR&nbsp;FUTURES!&nbsp;ffft. 

Saturday night we went to see the national ballet and royal winnipeg ballet as an early b-day present from my rents. Pretty crazy there, we couldn't find anywhere to have a beer after that didn't have coveerrr. Tons of people, and they have some crazy pavilion type thingies set up (like the aboriginal pavillion and the irish pavilion) which have huuge lineups and supposedly 25$&nbsp;cover bleck. 

And I think I should mention that saying bye to bradem was super sad :(&nbsp;I'm going to miss that crazy guy! But we have turned his room into an office, which I am currently sitting in, and now we have a closet for our vacuum and for guests to put their coats in."

Last night we went for all you can eat fish'n'chips at the cockney kings (and forgot to invite john b.). Soph and Jase came with, then we went back to our place and played cranium. We had to make play doh since the shit we had was all rotten.

Turns out Bradem is leaving next Saturday. It will be sad to see him go, but we are most deffinitly looking forward to actually having somewhere to sit and work in our house. &quot;On the bed&quot;&nbsp;isn't really cutting it for me.

hopefully tripple-o's is still serving b-fast. All I've had today is a banana and a cup of tea. I'm going to get some sustenance, then some coffee, and then study. We will see how that goes."

"event","I randomly quit journaling, so I guess it's nice to throw something in here every once in a while. <br /><br />Last week was nuts. I had a midterm, an assignment, two rehearsals and a show. And I was sick. But I managed. I think I am officially no longer a dancer. It was kind of our last shot at performing with SFU, anyways, so now anything I want to do will be with the professional community and take some actual effort. We re-did &quot;its rather dark in here&quot; and Bradem mixed the music. Didn't get picked for the mainstage though. Boo. At least my mother darling got to see it when she was in town.<br /><br />Afterwards we went to <a href=""http://www.nuevotangovancouver.com/"">Santi and Deborah'</a>s. Their house is beautiful! Their little rug-rat was asleep, but they have another one on the way! They did a total re-mod on this run down place near Nanaimo and 6th. It's exactly where I hope I can live in the future. Emilio and I are talking about how poor we are, where we'd like to be etc if we don't hate each other in another 2 months. We were discussing putting ourselves on a wait-list for some buildings in the Main st. area, and then maybe in two years... bah. It's all speculation anyways.&nbsp;<br /><br />I sent off my application yesterday... fingers crossed."

On the plus side, since I jumped out of the shower in fear, I didn't get a chance to rinse to shampoo out of my hair. So I rinsed in the kitchen sink sans conditioner and I kind of like the effect. Maybe I will quit conditioner."

I had two exams yesterday. it was bruuuutal. I wrote my math exam in a tiny little room with one window and I kept getting eraser crumbs everywhere and then I had to blow them off the table, but then I had to erase more stuff. It was quite annoying. I hope my prof got the exam, I left it with the woman across the hall. 

My padre is officially retired, and the district put on a little presentation. It was nice to see some of my sibblings for once. We went to Milestone's after, apparently just missing phoenix. Them Emilio and I had to make it up to the uni to babysit the two little guys.

"event","Upcoming Show:

Friday, December 4th 2009 at the SFU Theatre. Time, TBA. 

I will be performing in a ~4min duet that Sophie and I choreographed, (loosely) based on the poems and drawing of Shel Silverstein. Its kind of dark and quirky, but so are the poems. Come if you can!

This was a last minute affair, we decided we were going to do a piece on Tuesday, had our first rehearsal yesterday, and just made it for the sign-up. On the plus side, after being depressed for the past month and losing my motivation entirely last week to the point where I didn't even try and do my math assignment (and it wasn't hard) I'm noticing that maybe this whole ""science"" thing really isn't for me. I think the balance I'm looking for means keeping dance, physicality and creative expression in my life.

I took my first ""meditation"" walk between classes today. I was noticing that when I walk slowly, I pretty much lose my balance very slightly with every step. I was determined to do the equivalent of a lap around the AQ very slowly. I got a lot of strange looks, but the funny part was when I ran into Jason and he was all ""wow, you're walking really slow"" and then I had to explain to him what I was doing and of course sounded a little off the deep end, so to speak. I'm ok with that. 

It feels good to be a dancer again.

A tree house, a free house,
A secret you and me house,
A high up in the leafy branches
Cozy as can be house.
 
A street house, a neat house,
Be sure and wipe your feet house
Is not my kind of house at all~
Let's go live in a tree house.

"event","So I actually did half dec on my math/phys midterms. Above average in both! 71% in physics and 74% in math. I'm happy with that, considering I landed a whopping 48% of math midterm one, which believe it or not was one above average. 

School poo! I'm planning my life for the next three years, at which point I should finally be able to say I have a degree. I'm taking nothing but 3 psyc courses next semester. I am so happy about it! I will have time! And a life! 

On the downside I think I've come down with some chronic fatigue and mild depression. Called up my daddy on thursday balling, talk about embarrassing. 3 breaks downs in one week, someone should get me in the bath more often. And tell me to chill the fuck out. Emilio has been fantastic, unfortunately now he's got a cold and I will have to make my own damn licorice tea.

Oh, and I finally got up off my fat ex dancer's ass and did some yoga yesterday, and of course I strained my shoulder. Then when I got home I was so tired I had to curl up into a ball for an hour. Getting back into shape is going to be a little harder than I originally imagined.

Ok this is officially considered rambling, I have nothing of importance to say."

I&nbsp;had a bath today and went out with soph for some tea. The starbucks guy was blatantly and shamelessly hitting on me, and it was strange because a. I&nbsp;never get hit on and b.

"event","I dont know with my relationship with dance is anymore. My school life has turned entirely academic, which I enjoy. I'm maintaining my physicality through swimming, yoga and capoeira. My work life has become dedicated to the four children I work with, which makes it incredibly difficult to cut back on work hours (working 40 hour a week plus full time school equals no life). But what am I? A dancer? An autism support worker? A Biological Psych student? A hermit? A social flake? A workoholic? 

Last night I went to my first dance show in roughly a year. Made me cry to see the way those women move.

Anyways, Nat and I are working on a costume-specific/site specific piece. We had one rehearsal where I was in heels on the SFU roof, but we eventually got kicked off by security due to my yelling too loudly. Does this allow for my integrity as a dancer to remain?

I don't know if I'm even ""Maria"" anymore, whatever that means.

Maybe if I just focus on the intercellular spaces in my body, think about how the world actually moves through me, I can forget about this idea of ""who"". Dance will find me if its meant to be."

So that, and I've been in an awful mood for the past while because my roommates (excl. Emilio) are hella messy. bleck.

And I got my textbooks fucking $420 later. Fuck school! And what is with me shopping for my texbooks directly across from Emilio's textbooks? Usually I'm in the Fine and Performing Arts section at the other side of the store but not this time!! MATH!? CHEM!???!!! I'm bracing myself......"

We went to the point tonight and I saw 10 separate people that I knew from High school. Fucking weird. You do all this random partying with people you actually talk to and then running into people is the weirdest thing. Especially when you remember who you were when you knew them but how different you are now from who you were then.

Bradem is going to fill a bedroom cause the economic downturn means downsizing in lots of places such as the one of his employment and he has to study for his MCAT anyways.

My eyes are tired already, they've been itchy itchy all day. I've been sneezy sneezy. Stoopid spring. When can it be May??

My mom's going to live with us for two months. I can't comment on that yet.

If I don't get a raise I'm going to get a new (fourth) job.

I don't know why &quot;8&quot; is all of a sudden a magic number, but now that it's been 8 months I feel my attitude has changed. I woke up annoyed. I've been putting my thoughts on the things that annoy me, when in fact nothing has actually changed about the nature of our relationship--it's just as innocent, loving, and beautiful as it always was. But putting all of this emphasis in my own mind about 8 months, all the expectations that I&nbsp;had kept at bay about &quot;THE&nbsp;FUTURE&quot; now seem ...appropriate. How absurd! Why can't I just see a beautiful, sleeping creature?&nbsp;Why do I see my own laziness and faults? <br /><br />In a sense, I've always combatted my own fear of failure with a strategy to prove how untrue it is, instead of just disregarding the absurdity of it completely. I used to be gung-ho about dancing, now I'm gung-ho about waking up at the same time every day and getting good grades. Maybe its like how we shield our eyes when someone is embarrassed and utterly humiliated, or somehow deeply injured. We <em>know</em> the pain on some level, and the threat to <em>who we think we are</em> is so great that we would rather not have to think about it. Is it guilt?&nbsp;Maybe it's guilt about your own &quot;sins,&quot; needlessly trying to protect someone else, because you wern't able to avoid those same &quot;mistakes&quot;.&nbsp;Trying to save the world from pain and suffering. <br /><br />What a typical Maria story. Thats not love, thats what the ego tries to say is love, so that we can hold on to the misperceptions that led us to believe in failure in the first place. It's comfortable because it's what you know, but its really not what I want.<br /><br />What is that quote? &quot;Change your mind and the world will follow?&quot; something along those lines..<br /><br />"

"event","Well I finally did it.

After 3 years I got me hair cut. And I got 80s hair. Whats it compareable too? At first I thought recent Paul Stanley...but they I discover probably more of a Glenn Tipton only with thicker hair.

I like it, its just different and of course I started shaking while they were cutting it..seeing all the hair on the floor made me freak. They cut like 10 inches off my bangs so yeah.

Anyways...set up a cross trainer yesterday and spent a half hour trying to figure out how to turn it on before I noticed the big red switch in the front >_< 

And I seriously want to get rid of this thing...for a chinchilla its reall unfriendly and that sucks...

"event","I guess scientists are trying to create a robot to do house chores...as nice as that would be its a little scary.

Robots right now are being created for convience..but what if it goes beyond that? They start to fight our wars and make life altering decisions.  Will robots eventually have judgement like a humans?

If there is another disaster in America and a robot is sent in to clean up...will they eventually get to the point where they see a dead human that they will feel sick and turn away not able to perform their job?

Just wondering where this whole robotics thing will advance to...so Im done now.

Note: Im sure Im not the only one who looks at random tiny pic images for laughs...so Im going to post some of the good ones I find...people are really messed up sometimes but sometimes you find something really cool. 

Nevermind. Tinypic is being really retarded.

EDIT: On fuse.com they have a Taste of Chaos fighting game with the lead singers fighting...I cant believe I played it haha its amusing..its like shitty artists beating the crap out of each other...

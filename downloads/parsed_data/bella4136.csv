"event","Hey everyone its been quite a while since ive written in here, so i thought that i would catch ya'll up on a bit. I started school a while ago, and i haven't been able to see lance in forever it sux really bad i hope that things change cuz its really hard. School's a lot rite now, and i'm in all honors so i get a lot of hmwk and yet i have high expectations.

Well heres my schedule:

1st hour - Rubio...honors World History
2nd hour - Pierce...1/2 Spanish
3rd hour - Lil Herner...Aid Gym

LUNCH (this is considered 4th hour...weird i kno)

5th hour - Mrs. Farell/Mr. Kus...Honors World Lit (GAYYY)
6th hour - Mr. Farell...Physics
7th hour - Phifer...FST

I normally have hmwk everyday, but lunch is a lot of fun. I thought that going bak to school wouldn't be any fun, but i really am enjoying it a lot. I love it for some reason, i get to see all my friends that i used to hang out with that got jobs over the summer or went on vacation again..WEOOO! The only thing i don't like it American lit, cuz ive never ever liked english, even tho i like my teachers a lot this year.

Like last week, me and Kelly hung out with some friends, and we took Jim's jeep. They left us at Beaners so we had to walk to the mall, and when we got there they told us to meet them at (somewhere im drawin a blank lol) so then we went to the bathroom and came out and found Jim's car. Me and Kelly started unzipping it, and then i jumped in and unlocked the door for her. She got in and we THOUGHT...we locked em' out but we forgot that they had tha keys...DOOOPPE lol! That was a lot of fun tho!

Ive had a really bad headache for like the past couple days and i think that im PMS'n and it sux i jus wis that it would start and end!!!!!! lol

Yesterday was Lee's 19th Birthday, and Sam Hallenbecks 17th birthday (girl u needa get yo licence haha). 

When i was at school yesterday at lunch some things were bothering me and some people that i don't wanna open up 2 the entire world in here were gettin on my nerves. I didn't kno what to do nemore, and i felt like shit and couldn't consintrate. I proceeded to go to class and i layed my head down. I came out to get a tissue and when i was walkin down the hall i ignored everyone when they said something to me, so they all knew that something was the matter. On my way bak from the bathroom, Kyle was walking down the hall and hit me with him hat and i jus glared at him lol. When i got bak in class, Spence came ova to me and asked me if i was okay and i shook my head and told him i didn't wanna talk about it. Then Kelly came over and she looked and me and was like aww dani whats the matter and i tried to explain but i couldn't and i started cryin so i ran outta the door and Spearman was out there and so he gave me a hug and tried to cheer me up. Nothing work so my teacher gave me a hug and got my stuff and i went down to the clinic and my mom came and got me and i came home and slept. When i woke up i had a lot of text messages and Missed calls. 
-~- Thank you to all my friends that were there for me, it means a lot that you guys care so much :) I'll always be there for you guys, and it puts a smile on my face jus thinkin bout how happy u guys make me! idk what id do witout ppl like you!!!!!! I'm so greatful! :)

Lance and Lance came into town on wednesday, and we all hung out. I got my hair cut, and it looks good, Lance thinks so too!!! WEOOO! lol. Its layered and like maybe 2 inches past my shoulder. I didn't get highlights tho, because all my old highlights r coming bak through, lol so i said forget it. After that we all came home and watched 13 going on 30, that was really cute. Lance W. didn't get to pay much attention to it tho, because he was in my brothers room playing all diff. sorts of things lol!! Finaly i went in there and saved him. We all got done, played some cards...and then the guys left ;) haha. They came bak tho, and lance and i went upstairs and had a very important and needed converstaion. i really like those kinda of converstaions...we need them more often...lol.

Me and Linz wanna go to Homecoming or at least one formal dance this year together, and so in my dream my mom took us shoppin for prom, and we like were jus tryin on like EVER dress we saw, tryin on shoes, and jus having a lot of fun. We finaly found our dresses and i called Lance and i was like....""LANCE I FOUND MY PROM DRESS! IM SO EXCITED WILL YOU GO TO PROM WITH ME!!!!!"" and he goes..""Oh i don't wanna go to prom with you...plus its a waste of money"" i was like wuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lol i was so confused, so i said ""fine"" and hung up lol.
Then Linz called Joey (her dumass ex lol) and she tells him the same thing i told lance...and hes like...""No i dno't wanna go to prom with you...its a waste of time and money, and its jus not worth it"" and she got pissed off and was like....fine me and Danielle will go together haha. We ended up going together and we had a blast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","<font face=""Lucida Calligraphy"" color=""#000000"">Today really hasn't been the best day of my life, and it hasn't been the best day for some other ppl as well. Rite now i dont feel good, and i haven't aten in a very long time, and im hungry...but i can't eat because i dont feel good :(. OHH and i was outside on the phone, and i got bit by this really big mosquito, and its big and hurts :(.

Last nite Lance spent the nite at Linz house and his mom told him no and he did neways because he wanted to spend some time with her, which it totally understandable, and so when he got home today...his mom and him got into a very big fight and they aren't gettin along rite now :'(. I don't wanna tel you the details because...well its not really my business to tell. I jus really wish that things could get better. She kept asking for his cell phone, and now she finally got it so i can't talk to him nemore :'( i miss him MORE THEN ever now. 
*baby, i really hope that things get better between you guys....i hate seein it like this...I jus don't want things to get ne worse then what they r now:(. I can't wait to see you on Friday, and spend some time with you, that will be a lot of fun. I'm glad that our one month is on saturday, and i really hope that we share millions more. I hope that things get better, ill always be here for you, and ill be by ur side throughout this whole situation. I'm really sorry once again, i love you so much, and u will never loose me. i promise. Thank you for everything hun. I'm glad that i have someone as special as you in my life.*

NEXT THING....

Lindsey and Joey broke up....:( I really wish that they would have lasted...butttttttttttttt hes an ass to her and NEVER once treated her rite. She deserves WAY more than him, she deserves a gentlemen, a guy that can treat her with respect, someone that will put everything he can into the relationship and make sure that everything between them works out. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR hes such a dickface, i hate his guts!!!!!! When i takl about him i jus get so wound up because i kno that he meant a lot to Linz but he treated her like shit, and didn't really even act like he cared...which really hurts a person and he didn't realize that! 
He told her the wrong things on the phone, and was never nice. Hes a fag face, and i hope that he rots in helll!!!!!!! Were going to torture the hell outta him now!!! i cant wait it will be lots of fun!!! I'm going to come to one of your Football games...ill try to make it to all of them, and im going to make a sign that says JOEY SUCKS!!!! hehe!!!!!! that would be so fun :), hes a lil shit head, and he defenately doesn't deserve someone as awesome as you! 
Girl i love ya so much! your so funny, and a blast to hang out with, even tho weve only hung out once...that was enough to kno that your a great person. Your sucha wonderful friend to me, and you actually care. Your one of my best friends and like a sister that ive never had, i want you to kno that i will always be here for you, NO matter what. I'll be by your side through nething, i got your bak! I can't wait to hang out on friday, it will be so much fun! I think that i found u a guy too! I already told you about him tho, but i have more. Ill see if he wants to hang out!!! I'm sure he will! I can't wait to see you again!!!!! Love ya so much girlie, take care! If you ever need nething don't hesitate to call me :) OHH and gettin ur haircute was a good idea! im sure that it looks darlin on ya!!!!!!

NEXT THING.......

Lauren called me when i was on the phone with Kelly, and she told me that she wanted to talk to me so i called her house. We talked for a bit, and since i spent a lot of time with her, and shes like my sister...i could tell by her voice that something was the matter. I finally got it out of her, and i guess Josh told her today that his parents don't like her......WAT THE HELL! When i went over there to pee one time, his parents were being really nice to her. OHH and they told Josh that he can get better then her!!! CAN YOU FUCKIN BELIEVE THAT!!!! I was so pissed off! i can't believe the way some parents act...its soo....ridiculous. neways she asked me to come to her band recital next saturday, and then go tubing with her, if Josh doesn't go. I'm excited and i hope that i have nothing planned.
*Girlie i miss you so much!, im glad that i got to talk to you today, because i havent in a while. Sorry that i didn't pick up my phone tha past couple days :(, idk why i was busy. Anyways, i think that you deserve better then Josh too, especially if your not feelin the sparks nemore. You'll find that person sooner or later :) and no matter what ill love you, i don't care what neones says!!!!! I'll always be here for you, got it! i love ya bunches and i love spending time with you. We'll have to do a week thing either here or at your house in the winter over break :) that would be fun! i miss you a lot, and im still tryin to adjust to you not being here with me...ICH LIEBE DICH FUR IMMER!!!*

I can't wait till Kelly comes bak home i miss her a lot! I haven't seen her in a while either so that sucks!!!! hehe!
lets see what did danielle do today...hmmmmm.......i woke up at like 10:30 watched the nanny till 11:30 then the golden girls. I called Lance around 12:00 to talk to him for bit :), i wanted to wake him up but he was already awake...damn lol jp! I helped him look up the number for drivers training at Sears...so that he can come and see me, but i wasn't ne help lol...what new? It was really nice outside so i thought that i would go lay in the sun for a bit, and i did jus that. I was supposed to go shopping to get some new bras, cuz it hurts wearing actually ones cuz of my burn lol, so yea but when i was taking&nbsp; a shower my brother came in and told me that i was supposed to babysit one of the kids over there till like 10:00 tanite, so i coudln't go shoppin nemore. Anyways i was online for a lil bit, and i was being a mean gf cuz i was in a bad mood, cuz i couldn't go shoppin, i hate last min. plans grr lol. 
*Lance im sorry if i was being mean to you :( i really hope that your not mad, ikno that you i have my moments, sorry. I love you so much!*
After that i called him and we talked for a bit, and he cheered me up, he makes me so happy :). I'm glad that i have someone as special as him in my life. 
LINDSEY CAME HOME FROM CAMP!!!! YAYAYAYAYAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i missed her!!!!! WEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Anyways i talked to her for a bit, and she told me that Joey (GRRRRRRRR, he makes me mad when i talk bout him haha) went to see the Village with the two chicks that he told he canceled going to see with. It mad me really upset and i wanted to shoot his ass lol! and she told me there was more. I feel so bad for her, i jus wish that there was a guy out there that would treat her the rite way. Shes such a goregous, nice, and fun girl that deserves someone WAY more matture then him. We need to put him though boot camp, and teach him how to treat her, shes a lady and his girlfriend, not a friend and a piece of crap!!!! lol
After i talked to her i pretty much jus lounged around. I talked to Verizon about my bill and everything is going to be taken care of :) YAY!!! that made me happy. I got to talk to Kelly too! We talked about my week and everything that happened. She told me about how she missed me, and we made plans for thursday and friday. I'm going to stay the nite with her on Thursday nite, YAY!!!!!!!!!!! low key im kinda scrared of her dog tho haha!
We ate dinner....then i got bak on the phone with lance he was busy with Lindsey and Ashley, so i told him that i would call him later. Sam gotta job at L&L so durning her break she came over and said hi, and i walked her bak up to work, and picked up some milk....MILK HAS TAX isn't that crazy! I walked home, and then sat outside on the porch and talked to my mom for a bit. I tried callin Lauren too but she never picked up :( i miss her, and its diff. not being wit her everyday, its hard gettin used to. Then again when kelly stayed with me it was the same way lol, cept i can c kelly all the time lol cuz she only lives seconds away, haha. 
I layed down on the couch and called Lindsey, we talked about Joey, and i gave her some advice, i think that lance is going to call im tomorrow and talk to him about the whole hes a jerk situation, jus not be as harsh. Hes a jackass to her and she deserves better. i suggest that he shape up soon!!! lol I let her go tho beacuse her lance n her sister were hanging out and i didn't wanna bother em'. 
I came in got online and now im writing in my journal!!! lol Lance wrote me bak :) YAY that made my day! now im happy lol.

At aboubt 4:30 mom and i went to verizon wireless, to fix my bill that it an outstanding cost of one million dollars (exageration lol). I fought with the lady for about an hour till i got fed up with it, and i walked out on her cuz i was ready for a vacation. We met Mamma (what i call laurens mom) and Lauren at Carter's and we then left and headed to the Cabin. We got up there at about 9:00, and got wendys (MMMM...SEX) haha and then played cards all nite!!!! lance called me and he told me that he gotta new cell phone :) a.k.a i can call him all tha time now weooooO! I talked to him on the phone for a while, and Lauren Kept having to leave the room to talk to him (secrets r bad!!! lol jp), then we got tired and went to bed.

Friday, July 23rd~ We woke up kinda late, and had planned on going to the beach, but it was really cold, and so we jus went shopping...yay! we went to the bear store and got some candy n stuff, and then went to this others store and i got lance a suprize, i got him a red hearted stuffed anmial that i said he should sleep with, and then this orangeish heart that he HAS to hang in his car when he gets it! We got some chicken, and then went bak to the cabin watched tv got a pizza and watched movies and played cards. Lindsey called me that nite, and we planned something for this week. Joey and her went a movie and i wished them good luck :) and then we were jus talkin bout lance and the fair and wishing and then tryin to plan something. Then i went out and finished watchin ""On the Ropes"". Lauren and i went to our bedroom when it was done played cards read magazines...josh was being an ass..like usual and then went to bed. 

When me and lauren were playin cards that nite, she told me that whenever u drink a water at the bottom of the bottle is always ur spit, and so like whenever i drank a water i would grossed out, and like not drink the rest and my mom was like, danielle seriously u have like 5 not finished bottles of water what is wrong with them haha!!!

We watched some movies, ate some food, and then watched some more tv lol. we were being really lazy and for some reason we were really tired. We finally decided to go for a walk, so we walked down this road and up to the store. On our way bak from the store, this lil 4 year old was like...""awww, your cute"" lol it was really funny. Later on we got home played some more cards then watched tv again lol. We talked on the phone with friends for a bit, had dinner...brats i think, and then took another walk.

When we got there i took a shower, had dinner, and then met josh, he was outside when i got outta the shower. Him and Lauren were messin around, you could somewhat tell they missed eachother, lol. Later on Lance acted really depressed and he wouldn't tell me what was wrong. Finally at like 12:00 he told me what was the matter and i was shocked lol. I realy dont want him to think what he did. i love you so much hun, and i dont have feelings for him ne more okay!!! i promise! ur the one i care about. Lauren went to bed because she had volleyball in the morning, and then i finally went to bed.

Jason (her bf) and Kyle went with us too. Judy, Jason and Kyle, went shoppin and me and lauren went shopping, we met up at Mervyns at about 4:30 cuz mamma was coming to pick us up. When we were in Marshall Fields, i saw these two really really pretty rings, one was a purple heart with a silver band, and then the other one was a pastel bluish color ring with a silver band (it also had diamonds on the side. We went home and relaxed for a bit. Lauren had band, and so me and mamma watched The Last Samari and then we went to get lauren. We actually went to Sandys house this time, and got the top to the computer desk they got the previous morning. We got a pizza on the way home, and then relaxed. We were jus on the computer and stuff and jus chattin, listenin to music and such, then we called Lance and Lance and they brought us shakes lol! After that we threw em' in the freezer and went to bed.

I went there to see her, and this was the day that i got to spend the most time with her, so i really enjoyed myself. We watched a lot of Jerry Springer lol, and then we went by the pool and layed in the sun for about an hour and a half. Also some bitch told Matt (aubreys boyfriend) that she cheated on him. WHICH SHE DID, but she didn't want it to get out, so when we find out who it is, imma cuss her ass out :) YAY!!!!!!! When we got bak she took a shower and got ready for band. We took her to bad, and i talked on the phone,talked to mom about her new job and ate Spaghetti. When she got done we went and rented EuroTrip and Dickie Roberts. Eurotrip was really good. Durnin the movie, lance called me and told me that he was coming, over i gave the phone to Lauren cuz if he was going to come over it shouldn't be up to me.i guess she said that he said he was drunk and so she told me i asked him he promised me he wasn't then i gave the phone bak to her and i guess that Lance O. was.i was pissed cuz i don't drink cuz of him and for tha fact that hes had so much problems with his family. I hung up on him and then he called me bak and was like me and Lance were driving and we fishtailed into a tree, when the cops get here were going to be in so much trouble, beacuse of when they test our breath. I started crying because i was so worried. I hung up cuz i was so scared, and then he called me bak telin me that he lied to me, which pissed me off even more, so i cried even more. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRrrr (can someone give me an ""R"") haha jp. We lost signals and Lance called me from Lance O's house. He told me that he was really sorry and i jus told him how i felt and i was really upset with himl He asked me if him and Lance could come over to appoligize, and we said yea, and we had to promise that we wouldn't yell at them or throw nething at em when they were there. They came over, and Lance brought me and Flower, Shake and some candy. He appoligized to me, and it was all good again. I LOVE YOU. we got into the house and i started drinkin my shake and i realized that it was CHOCOLATE!!!!!!! i was so mad! beacuse i hate chocolate.

They got it and went there and complained. they told them that i was allergic to chocolate, and that i could have gotten seriously injured from them screwing up my order! lol!!! They brought it bak and then we told em good nite and i went to bed, Lauren stayed up.

Thursday, July 29th~ Today was the day where i had planned to go Putt-Putting with lindsey Joey me and Lance. Lindsey was supposed to pick us up at 1:30 but got delayed because she was going to camp on friday morning for about a week or so, and we wanted to hang out b4 she left. She didn't get there till a lil bit later so Lauren and Josh couldn't go but they were going to come with us tonite so things were fine. We all Putt-Putted, and it was really funny, cuz i hit one of my balls on the other side of the property, but Lance being the wonderful gentlemen he is went and got it for me, i swear i don't kno what i would do without him, i mean hell i didn't wanna go to the other side of the fence!! lol thats why i got him :) hehe!!!!! i love you babe! Then when we were done her mom took us to this coffee shop where she insisted that i get this smoothie for like 3.00. it was really good!! (mmmmm sex haha) Then we went to A&W and had lunch or dinner or w/e lol. After taht we went for a walk down the river walk it was fun we all jus talked and then split up and said we were going to meet at Her cousins work. Me and Lance walked and talked and it was nice to spend a lil bit of time together. We got there, and then her mom dropped me off at Laurens house. We told them that we would meet them at Showcase Cinema's at 10:30 so that at midnite, we could watch The Village. When Lindseys mom took me home i gotta talk to her for a bit, she was really really nice, and she was very pretty! When Josh, Lauren and I got there we noticed that no one else was there and that the show wasn't showing so i called Linz and told her, she was really upset and so we didn't kno what we could do. We drove around for a while, and we went to a bowling alley. At the Bowling Alley i did pretty shitty haha but it was fun while it lasted, all of us had a lot of fun, and everyone did really well!!! lol and they also had really good music, after that we didn't kno what to do, but we knew that we wanted to bed out later then that. so we went to Capitol Coney Island. Lance and his blonde self dumped a full shaker of salf and pepper, into his water, and then drank it for 2.00. He was sneezin for hoursssssssssss trust me haha!!!! Then they gave him another 1.00 to do it again. Poor baby was sneezin for hours lol. Then we went home and my shoulder was kiling me because i have a bad shoulder as it is so it hurt even more. I iced it for a bit, and then went to bed. Both of us did.

I jus wanted to say Linz ur a great girl, your so much fun, and your gorgeous. Your so nice to everyone and you make sure that everyones happy! your awesome and i can't wait to hang out again!!! good luck with Joey!!! things will get better, and if hes not that one for you, then i kno ull find the rite one.

Friday, July 30th~ Me and Lauren were jus relaxing and didn't have much of anything planned. so we jus lounged around. when her mom got home we were going to plan on having the guys over but josh couldn't come and lance didn't have a ride home. So we called Judy and she came over with her friend, we watched Eurotrip again, and ate some popcorn. When it was done, we read magazines, and jus talked online. Lance, and Lance brought us wendys and some candy later that nite and it was YUMMYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol i had a lot of fun at Laurens and unfortuneatley, that was my last nite :(. My mom called me earlier and told me that i had a proposison and it was to go to Cedar Point with my dad, trent, marce and lindsey (not from flushing) lol. I didn't want to go at first because i missed kelly and watned her to stay the nite and go to the corn roast and then go to see Trajan the next day at her family reunion, i didn't go tho, because i knew that i hadn't seen him since like last week thursday...and i missed him and i kno that he missed me and he would be sad if ididn't go. So i missed out on seein my russian buddy, but ill get to see him b4 he leaves or he said that i would be dead lol!!!!!!! weoooooooo hahah!!! Later that nite my shoulder was really hurting me so i put ice on it. I met Bia and Danni, they wre really nice and they told me that i was pretty lol. They were really pretty themselves.

"event","Hey Amigos (kelly taught me that word) lol. Whatcha up 2? well not a WHOLE lot has happened recently but i mean its not like nothing has happened at all because things have a happened..WOW thats confusin, and for you blondes out there...i won't mention any names COUGHCOUGHLANCEANDLAURENCOUGHCOUGH...im sure it confused you :)

Lets see...tha lst day i wrote in here lemme check ;) *pause*...
well on thursday....Kelly came home (YAY) and i didn't do nething but sit around, Justin and Jimmy came over, and we all played football for a bit, and then we got ice cream, and i went inside. Dad got some pizza from Pachzzis and everyone was kinda on there own. I went over to Lee's that nite to say hi to tha family, and then i went home around 10:00. My knee was really bothering me, so my mom made me ice it for a while and take some meds. It hurt all nite, and im still wondering what is wrong with it. HMMM....*ponder*. I really didn't get to talk to Lance to much *boohoo* until i got home, and got rested up. I finally got on tha phone wit him later that nite, and we talked till about 2:00. I love him so much!....its so fun talkin to him cuz he likes to joke around and most of the time we can keep a conversation goin.

On friday........Kelly came over WEOOO missed her!...Lauren left for Pennsylvania :( and...........i didn't get to talk to Lance that much once again. All of us went to Cayden's concert. We got to see a lot of old friends, and meet some new ppl. There band sounded REALLY GREAT...i was SUPER suprised. We stayed there for like an hour, and i got hungry, so we went to Wendy's, and got some food. Justin bought me and Kelly dinner...YUMM....thank you justin :). Then they took us to Hooters...and wouldn't buy us shirts so we locked em  outta tha car ;). Finally we let em in and went to Target, then to Meijers. I guess Kelly and Justin made out in an aisle, which they thought was pretty cool..haha. Beans called us for a ride, we went and picked him up...took him home, and then went to Q.D for some ice cream and pop to make floats. We came home, i gotta talk to my baby until like 2:00 or so and then went to bed. BTW my shakes were freakin of tha hezzie haha...a.k.a. REAL good! When i woke up...i got an e-mail from Lance :) HES SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SWEET! i love you sooooo much baby!!! u always no how to make me *smile* hehe :)

That morning, i got ready, and hadda get up at 8:30. We started takin Kelly home, cuz me and my brother were going to our Omas i was going to Oma Hamilton, and he was going to Oma Snow. On our way droppin of Kelly...Jesse said that he felt sick so we took him home and Kelly watched him while my mom and i went to ""Everlasting"" a flower place with a BUNCHA flowers! I'm not that good wit flowers cuz i can't really grow em' so........i jus helped them pick some out. My mom Left and My Oma and Opa took me to my otha Omas house lol. Wow this sounds confusin lol. Anyways i got there and she made me Grilled cheese, and salad. MMM it was good. OHh yea she made me a batch of Cookies too! YUM i couldn't eat em all tho lol. Later on......We played cards for like 4 hrs then went to Subway for Dinner. It was really good. We got home played Yahtzee, and Scrabble, UNO and Skip-Bo...lol well those were tha games that we had been playin earlier, and we came bak home and played more until like 10:00. I was freakin on a ROLL in UNO...im tha MASTA weooooooooooo! haha neone wanna try and beat me BRING IT ON......UHHHHHHHHHHHH what now!!! haha! My Oma and her sista talked on tha phone for like 3  hrs. over that period of time....i wrote Lance a letter, called a few ppl, saw a UFO, sang songs to myself, and watched tv. Me and Lindsey talked on tha phone for quite a while. Shes soooooooooooo nice!!!!!! lol im really jealous of her cuz she lives rite across tha road from Lance :( haha. We were plannin on going to the mall today at 1:00, but my phone died so i couldn't getta hold of her, and i hadn't written her number down newhere *DOPE*. hehe! Oh well hopefullly next time, i hope she isn't mad at me :(. Lance texted me later and my phone was dyin, but i talked on it until i fully died haha. We had a funny conversation and i got mad at him for ruinin his cell cuz i cant talk to him as much ne more :'( VERY SADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD! You wouldn't understand lol. I went to bed and that was the end of that day.

Today........i woke up n ate a donut. Got ready for church and saw a buncha family there. I felt sick durin tha middle of mass so i went downstairs and sat down for a bit. Tha bathrooms were near the bench where i was sitting, and i heard this kid like SCREAMIN lol so i went to tha door, and he was cryin...that he was stuck in tha bathroom. I couldn't get tha door open so me and this pregant women hadda like push really hard and we finally got him out. HAHA!!! that was soooo interesting. I felt so bad for tha poor kid. I felt a lil better so i went bak up and had communion. I made it through and then My aunt Kathy, Oma, and I went to Nick's for quick Lunch. I was supposed to be going to the mall, but my dumb phone...GRR! oh well. We had lunch then went bak to Oma's got my stuff and went to my otha Oma's...she wasn't home but all tha doors were unlocked so i assumed she was down at tha lake wit Uncle Jim and Aunt Pauline...i miss them :(. I didn't wanna stay there alone, so  i went bak ova to Oma's hosue and we played more cards until my mom got there. I finally got home around 4:00ish. Its nice to be home, i guess. I  got on the computer, and changed a lot of my picture frames pictures. One is of Lance, One is of me n lauren, and one if of Lindsey. They look really good :). My mom is makin dinner but im not really that hungry, my omas fed me so much i don't see house someone could be hungry haha.

"event","Hmm....on tuesday tha Lance's came into town, n got to my house around two o'clock. When they got here i was still babysitting, so we all jus layed around for a bit, and me an Lance cuddled on the couch. We wanted to have some time alone, to talk and have some fun ;) if ya kno what i mean. So we went downstairs. But of course everyone else followed us. So then.......we quickly ran upstairs, and we were alone for a lil' while, when all of the sudden my brother comes up. Hes botherin tha crap outta us, n im telllin him to go and turn kelly into a frog and lance o. into a princess or ballerina, n stuff like ill PAY you if you leave, ill take him for a bike ride later, and all this crap if he'll jus leave us alone for alil bit. So finally, he leaves and rite when we start talkin my PHONE rings!!!! grrr! lol. So then i get bak and my brother comes bak. Then he leaves and my phone rings, it was like a never ending process!!! lol. THENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN Lance o. and Aubrey came up! lol. WOW lance DON'T roll over ;-) haha. Lance O. and Lance had a competition to see who could fit the most Sour Patch kids in thir mouth at once lol. It was sick when they hadda spit em out, but it wasn't as bad as the Swedish Fish....THAT WAS SICKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!! My mom got home and we all were tryin to decide what we were going to do. I guess Marcus n David gave Lance O. n Lance a nasty look, and they got upset, cuz marcus still likes me, so i kissed Lance and he got mad..WEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! lol. Then my mom gave money to Lane O. to get a pizza. So they got us pizza and a movie. We started watchin it and Lance's phone rang, sooooooo.............. it was Lance's mom, he wanted him home. He got really upset because she kept hangin up on him, and then he threw his phone and it broke in half!!!! So they left but i'm somewat glad that he left because there was a bad storm and if they would have stayed longer then it would have been harder to drive threw. It was a lot of fun, and i always have fun when were together.

"event","Yesterday was a really fun day, Me, Kelly, my mom, and Jesse, when to Benton Harbor to see my sister Katie. Shes HILARIOUS, and she looks like Jessica Simpson...literally. We got there, hugged and then left for tha beach. There was an art fair goin on so there was a lot of really neat stuff! I was pushin my baby nephews Jo Jo and Nikky, there soooo adorable!!! B4 we left Katie was like rushin around tryin to get stuff, and she ran bak into tha house to get Nikky's suckie (pacifier) and she came out, and was like, ""sometimes i think that us adults need one of these cuz i could really use one...isn't a suckie for an adult called beer tho?"", haha it was sooo funny! So we got ta tha beach and me and Kelly took our clothes off and went in tha water, it felt SOOOO good because tha water was cold and it was SUPER hott out. We played in there for a bit, then came up to tha beach n layed in tha sun for a bit, lie 10 mins lata Katie came up and was like...so do you gurls have bfs? and i was like YEA!!!!!! wanna see a pic? and shes like OMG of course i doooooo lemme see!!!!! so i showed her a pic, and shes like wats his name and like put me through a quiz lol. She then was like...""AWWWWWWWWW bella hes sooooooo adorable...hes really hott!!!!!"" hahah, then she put tha pic up to my face, and was like, ""bella u guys look so cute together""...hahah!!!!!!!!!!! Then all tha sudden ther was this BIG boom, and they made everyone get out of tha water, we quickly packed up our stuff, and patrick (her hubbie) picked us up and took us to our cars. I was so mad cuz i wanted to get tan, cuz im SOOOOOOOOOOO WHITE :(. We all decided to go out to Applebees for dinner, and tha whole time we were there they told stories bout me when i was lil, and i played wit tha baby. He was jumpin up and down and screamin haha! it was so fun! i wanted to take him home soooooooooooo bad! We left there and went bak to Katies, and we hung out there until like 9:00. I taught Nikky how to crawl, by gettin down and racin him. He got really good, and when Katie saw she like freaked out! Then i fed him dinner, and cuddled wit him. We hada get going because it takes two hours to get home, and so i gave kt a hug, and told her that i loved her a lot and got in tha care wit Nikky haha, she grabbed me and was like BELLA U CAN'T take my baby home!!! lol so yea i gave her a hug and told me that ill always be here bella and that i am beautiful lol, and we went home. Shes like in love wit kelly too! lol Kellys so nice :-) I talked to lance like half of tha way home, i quizzed him from my cosmopolitan mag. cuz it had like tha 6 sexiest games to play wit men...i learned sum things ;-) hhaha!!!! He was like when i get my car, are you gunna want me to come and visit you all tha time? and i was like HELL YEA!!!!!!!!! lol and hes like we'll have a lot of fun but won't ur parents get sick of me always being over? and i was like NOOOOOO lol and lemme tell you ill never get sick of it ;-)!!!!!!...i even asked my mom and she said that she'd love to have him over all tha time :) lol! YAYAY WEOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Neways i got home talked on tha comp then on tha phone till like 2:00 and went to bed cuz i hadda get up for golf lessons tha next morning at 6:30...BLAH :-P

I got ready, and my dad took me and Jes to tha golf course. Stephanie, Amie and I golfed pretty well, but it was really sticky and hott outside, so it got tirin after a while. Were doing A LOT better tho now, and we can actually hit tha ball, and understand what clubs we should use n stuff! It was fun, when we got done, my dad made me some chicken, and i hadda go out and golf wit tha lil kids unda 7...was that hell. For a person wit no patience i would say that i did pretty damn well. They got really annoyin, but i couldn't do nething about it so i jus beared wit it, i only hadda help em play half of a hole, and it was a scramble neways so it went by pretty fast u could say. I went inside, and I worked tha Counter and sold a buncha stuff to all tha kids cuz Jenna was doin sumthin else. It was fun, and i always have fun doing it lol. I was really tired so when i got home, i came rite downstairs and went to bed, i took my annual monday nap lol. I woke up around 2:30 called my bf but he was busy and he went sumwhere so im waiting for him to get bak so i can talk to him.

"event","Yesterday was a really stressful day. My brother had one of his friends stay that nite, and i was in charge of them...HELL!!!!!! It was difficult tryin to get em' to go to bed and when i finally did my parents got home, and tha dog started barking, and it woke em' up again. Finally at like 1:00 i called Lance, and turned on tha Nanny, layed on tha couch and tried to relax. Joey (jesse's friend) was still up but tha tv mad him fall asleep. I started gettin tired around 2:00 or so, and i decided to go to bed. I always enjoy talkin on tha phone ta my baby at nite, cuz then i always sleep better :).

I woke up to tha sound of two kids screaming, lol and Breanne and her cousin Ellen came over, and babysat Jesse and Joey from 10-12 for me. Lisa (Jordan Spearman's mom), Jordan, and Nicholas came and picked me up and took me to Sexton, because Mrs. Herner told me that she would be there to fix tha check that my slow self screwed up bad lol. Anyways we got there, and none of tha doors were unlocked, so i called Lil' Herners cell and she told me that she wasn't there cuz Weight Trainin had been canceled for today, and that she was really sorry she hadn't called me to tell me. We left and went to Meijers to give tha owners or w/e Lisa's slip sayin that she could go bak to work again, because she had been on Vacation time from knee surgrey. We left and stopped at tha new dolla store..WEOO and then i went home. When i got there tha kids seemed happy and tha girls left, and i put tha boys in tha pool. 

Later on Marcus and David came over, he now has his car, and i was sittin in tha passanger seat. I asked him if i could drive and he told me that i could bak up, so i did and David was like Danielle jus take off down the road. So i did, i took off going 40, lol we flew ova the speed bumps and went around tha block, it was fun!!! i got bak, and Marcus said that i could drive again, so we all got in tha car and i took em all for a notha drive! WEOO!!!!! lol neways he left to go get his check, and i went in my bakyard and relaxed. Later on i went in tha house cleaned it really well, and then Joey's dad came to tha rescue and took him home!!!!!!!!

Jesse and i watched some Tv for a bit, and then his friend Micheal DUN DUN DUN came over. HES SOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!! i didnt want them to play, but i let em' and they had fun...i think. After like an hour, Jesse came inside, and we layed down. Lance called me and he was realy frustrated, and unhappy. It really hurts me when hes not happy, cuz i feel like its my job, and im failing at it. I kno that it was jus some common sibilin and family problems but still, i jus want to see a smile on his face, even if i cant see it, its a feeilng that ill have.

I walked up ta tha store to buy new tampons cuz i HATE tha cardboard ones my mom bought, and i came home and watched, ""about adam"" while talkin on tha phone. Jesse fell asleep really easy :-D and i went and got on the computer. I talked to Lindsey for a bit, and appoligized for tha otha nite. Shes really nice, and shes really funny, i wish her and Joey tha best of luck, and i hope that their relationship gets stronger and she has the courage to talk to him :). I also talked to lauren, to whom i haven't talked to in a while :( i miss her. We were talking about where she was going to Live in the future, and both of us r going to go to Germany for a bit, and also to tell them that she is going to be an American citizen, also we discussed when we were going to hang out again, i miss her a lot, and i hope that its soon, im lackin that otha part of me ;-)! OHH yea i also talked to Cayden, i haven't seen him in a WHILE, his band is playin on tha 17th and he asked me to come and watch them. It should be fun, and ill get to see all my old friends!!! WEOO!

Lance should be comin into town soon..i hope, i really miss him. I hope that today when i talk to my mom she understands and will drive me out there somtimes to see him so that we aren't makin Lance O. feel used, and jus so that i can spend a lil bit more time with him. I kno that long distance relationships are sometimes difficult, but i really care about him, and i kno that we'll make it work! I'll put everything i got into it! I love you babe!

Lauren i hope can sweet talk her mom into drivin her down here cuz that would put a smile on my face, i havent seen her in like over a week :( oh no!!!! lol well u mean a lot to me chick, i kno u kno that, and ill always be by ur side! i love ya babe! ICH LIEBE DICH FUR IMMER!!! GERMAN RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHAH!

Kelly should be coming over this afternoon, and we'll be going golfing at 4:00 and then out to dinner at Finleys....YUM GOOD CHICKEN CEASER SALADS! lol and then tomorrow were planning on going to my sisters house in Benton Harbor, going to tha art show, n then to tha beach to get a tan!!!

I still have a smile on my face from last nite, and im sure that i will for an extremely LONG time...and may i really Accentuate <font size=""+1""><b><u>LONG TIME</u></b></font>!!!! 

KELLY GOTTA NEW PICTURE/VIDEO CELL PHONE...its REALLY COOOOOOOLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Kelly came to my house at about 11:00 while me bein tha bum i am was jus lyin in bed watchin tha Nanny, but ask my close friends, thats not unusual haha. Anyways....I started gettin ready round 12:00 because Lance W. and Lance O. were comin into town. We didn't have ne plans for tha day, which always happens, so when they got here we sat on my porch for like an hour jus thinkin of sumthin to do...SLOW PPL!!!!!! haha. Finally sumone mentioned us jus going to tha park and pondering there. So thats what we did. I took them all on a long trip...through tha woods and on tha paths and finally to ""tha circle stone"". I guess tha guys felt like bein monkeys and tried to tear down trees in tha lil forest thing, so me and Kelly ventured off to tha water. The guys came down later, and throw a lot of rocks in tha water, pretending to be there normal age...4, haha jp! Anyways me and Kelly got hungry so we went to Wendy's (YUMM) to eat. I found a table in tha bak corner that we all sat and ate at. Lets jus say...there were a lot of interestin pictures takin, and Lance really enjoys Wendy's now, more then he used to ;-) HAHA! We left there and went....to tha mall. We helped lance o. pick out sum new shoes, and he bought me and Kelly new shirts!!! I gotta blue one and Kelly gotta black and pink one with lil cherries on it!! BTW...i won tha bet w/ Lance in this store, without havin to do nuthin..WAHOOOOO GO ME :). We Left there walked around ran into Erica n Beth, got sum sox, discussed clothing, and then went bak to tha park :). Me and Lance wanted some time alone and i wanted my prize....So Kelly and Lance O. went bak to my house and got some sweatshirts, blankets, and snacks. Me and Lance had a good time at tha park. I can tell you that i enjoyed myself, and i had fun ;-) A LOT OF FUN!!!! They got bak, and tha lances left to go to tha store to get some candy :). When they got bak we all jus chilled talked, and the guys had a contest to see how many swedish fish could be fit into their mouths. It was gross when it was over, and there was a shit load of swedish fish layin on tha woodchips...even in clumps..BLAH!!!!!!!! Sam H. called me earlier that day tellin me that she wanted to meet Lance W. and that her and Casey would be chillin at her house tanite and to stop by. So we all went to Sam's house and watched T.V., It was good to see her again i hadn't seen her in a while, missed her! I learned about a lot of stuff that i didn't kno, and Joey even came out to play! Later on we left there and started to Leave but i really hadda pee, so i quickly ran inside, and pissed...and SHIT tha ungodly and Loving Aunt Polly decided to visit me...lol. If ya kno what i mean if not i started my period. My tampons were in tha car to. So Lance O. took us to tha River and we all jus chilled there. kelly and i walked to tha middle of tha parkin lot, and she held tha blanket up while i shoved tha tampon in, haha, Luckly i had a skirt on, Easy access. BTW the river was the best part of tha nite. All of us were sittin on a stone talkin, and Lance told me that he wanted to talk to me. I went over there, and we talked for a bit, and then he popped tha ?!!!!!!!!! i shoudln't have even had to answer that one!!! lol i mean its an obvious answer rite? lol. I was soooooooo happy! Kelly and Lance O. were fighting about Cuss words, so we took a walk over to tha river bridge thingy. We were jus talkin, and i told him that this was tha begginin of a LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG LONG...and may i repeat myself <u><font size=""+1"">LONG</font></u>...relationship, but <b>not</b> in a bad way at

"event","Today i jus kinda relaxed all day, ive been very weak, and my sickness seems to jus be gettin worse everyday. I really was hoping that tomorrow when Lance comes into town i wouldn't be sick, but i dont think that i can change nething. I bought Sudafeed Severe Cold, and its takin away tha boby aches and head aches and some sneezin. I kept loosin my voice earlier too, oh well what can ya do?

Lets see, i woke up around 10:20 called Lance to say good morning, cuz he said he was gunna be up and to call him.....BUT he wasn't up so i felt bad for wakin him up...OPPS!!! lol! i layed around on tha couch till about 1:00, then walked up to Rite Aid to get my meds and some candy for tha kids i was watchin. I came home took a shower, feel asleep on tha couch from 6:30-8:30, and now im on tha computer!!! lol, sounds like fun eh? I'm supposed to be babysittin all day until 11:00 or so, cuz my mom and dad went golfin at Hawk Hollow..Oh tha jealousy, i wish i could go!

OMG i forgot to tell you, yesterday i wasn't feeling well either, and so my mom told me to get ready because we were going shoppin for a pool, after we got tha pool, she took me across tha road to tha mall, and she let me get my ears pierced again! Its my third hole, it looks really cool!!! lol. There were these 3 older teenage girls there and they were all like, ""Are you even nervous, cuz u don't even look it!"" and i was like, ""No after gettin this done three times now, i have nothing to worry bout, lol!"" It only took about 15-20 mins and i was outta there! I'm so happy now all i need is my fourth, my left cart. and my belly button and ill be happy!!! lol

Lance is comin into town tomorrow, i hope that everything goes okay, i don't think that ill be such a nervous break-down, lol i thought about it, and i have nothing to worry bout i love tha boy and he loves me!!! What can go wrong? rite? hehe! Other than bein really excited my days goin really slow, and tha more and more i think about it, i jus wish that tomorrow would hurry up and get here, so that i can get a huge hug!!!! I never thought that i could meet sumone on tha internet fall in love, and now all tha sudden get to see him as often as i hope i will get too! i love you babe!

I miss my twin so much! Ich Liebe Dich Fur Immer! i really hope that she will be able to make it into town next week that would be so kick ass!!! If anyone wants to go to common ground as a big group hit me up, and we'll set a date! that would be sweet!

Kelly...were going up north...*wink wink* GET IT hahah!!!!!!!!! man oh man! i can't wait to see ya tomorrow!

"event","Wow...a lot has happened in tha past couple days, and ive been slackin real bad to keep up wit my journal entries. We'll put it this way...Tuesday, was ultimatley tha best day of my ENTIRE life, cuz i gotta mean Lance!

Well lets see i was rushed around 11:00 to hurry up and get ready so that i wouldn't be behind when they got here. Lance O. drove Lance W. down here to hang out for tha day! Lauren got here at about...12:30-1 ish and she helped me get ready, along wit kelly...cept her stank ass got here at 8:30!!!!!! haha i still love ya! We all got prettified. We got outside, and i was seriously panicing, all these thoughts where goin through my head...""wat if he doesnt like me?"" ""hes gunna think im ugly!"" and so on. So they pulled in my drive way, and i was like OMG what do i do, so i ran up and i was like...""Can i have a hug, cuz im really nervous rite now, and that would make me feel better!!"" lol so yea we went up to tha store, and i got a flower...WEOO! lol then we went bak to my house, chilled took pictures, and poor Lauren fell outta her chair :(...its okay tho cuz everyone does! Me and Lauren road bikes, and Kelly Lance and Lance drove in tha truck to frances park! When we got their lance o. started cookin, and me and lance w. went for a nice walk. we walked through tha rose garden, and we went to tha ""circle stone thingy"" and talked for like a half an hour!...BTW hes an EXCELLENT KISSER ;-) thought i would add that one! lol. So we got bak and we ate steak, and i noticed that my earrin was gone. Me n Lance went bak to trace our steps and see if we could find it...*wink wink*, i swear tha WHOLE time we were lookin for my earring.....NOT!!!!!!!!!!!! lol. Anyways.......We left tha park and went to my house, played baseball, hackey sack(i didn't), football, and jus chilled for a bit, and decided on what we wanted to do. Kellys mom made her go home...GRR! that was sad. Lance Lance Lauren and Me all went to Eastwood Towncenter, and watched a movie..White Chicks....good movie, extremely funny! The best part of tha movie was gettin to cuddle wit Lance! We got home, and this was tha hardest part of tha day, sayin good bye :(. I gave him a hug and a kiss, and i jus quickly left cuz i knew tha longer i stayed tha harder it would be for me to leave. Tha whole time we were together it felt like a dream...but now i realize its a dream come true. Life serioulsy would not be tha same wit out Lance in my life. Hes so speical to me, and even tho we live quite a distance, we can make it work. Like Lauren says...""something worth while, is never easy to get""....and thats fo damn sho tha truth ;-). I love you...i still have a smile on my face!

Lauren i swear life wouldn't be tha same wit out you!

HAHAH!!!!!!! ur rite without ppl like that tha world would be DULL haha! i love ya chick never forget that!

"event","How can i be scared?...idk why i am, im even nervous, yet have this put excitement. Today was a very LONG day. I was talkin to Lance on tha phone until like 3:30, i really enjoyed it, but thats not unusual. I had to be up at 6:30 to be able to leave and be at tha golf course by 8:00 for golf lessons. Chloe, Stephanie, Amie and me were all in a group, we had a lot of fun, and i think...may i add that we did A LOT better than last week, and i actually understood how to pull tha lil cart thingy! :) YAY! GO ME HEHE! Every Monday me and Chloe come home afta tha lessons extremely tired, so when we got home we took our...""Weekly Nap"" lol. We slept from 1:30-5:00, WEOOOOO lol im re-energized now!!! We had dinner, watched tha Nanny and then rode our bikes up 2 Q.D and got ice cream!

Well your probably wondering what i meant by tha first sentence. Lance is coming into town to see me! Well i'm overly excited and i really can't wait until i actually get to give him tha BIGGEST hug ever! He means a lot to me, i jus have this nervous feeling, that he won't like what he sees. I really hope that everything goes well. He is really special to me, and i am so happy that i have him in my life. I really wish that we lived closer tho, because tha distance thing is unconvenient, but like they say...""love will find a way""...lets jus hope. 

This weekend was so much fun! I got to see Lauren..WEOOOOOOOOOOO shes a trip, and is funny as hell! We went to Coldwater Lake for a couple days and boy, did we have tha time of our life. We had a lot of blond moments, and theres so many memories that will never be forgotten. When we got togetha for tha first time, we went to Meijers, that was so much fun, i love meijers! they have everything! normally when i meet sumone for tha first time im really shy and quiet, but not this time, i was non-stop talk!!! lol we got coloring books, colored pencils, candy, a lot of junk food, pencil sharpener, and curlin iron. lol oh and a camera! We colored like tha hole way to tha place, when we got there we went to this place across tha road and like got ice, but as i was leavin i like sat at tha door tryin to open it for like seriously 5 minustes when lauren finally came up to me and said ""danielle you have to PULL tha door to get it open lol not push u dork!!!"" haha we got our ice and went to give them their key bak and i did it again!!! on my way out! haha.  Lance called me and we teased him about how i got to see her b4 him, he was quite tha jealous one, hehe! We went to bed kinda late, and woke up tha next morning, and got ready to meet tha family! We took pictures and colored once again haha. We then went up to tha cottage and messed around there for a bit. It was tha funniest thing ever, we kept eatin NON stop and we coudln't stop. Then later that nite my mom gave us more money too go get ice cream, we came bak sick lol from so much food and we hadda lay down for like an hour haha. Then i got up to go get a water, and of course i spot tha food, and i was like mmm......food and all tha sudden, us and our dumb selves start eatin again! lol. as if we hadn't had enough already! tha funny thang was that we kept sayin mmmmm....and it both reminded us of sex, haha it was tha funniest thing ever and both of us were talkin really loud and i think that tha neighbors could here it all haha! All tha sudden i really hadda pee, so i was sittin there like shaking, and like sayin ""Lauren i gotta pee really bad"" lol and she was like ""then go pee"" and all tha sudden i stopped shakin, and she looks at me and says, ""Oh NO!, Danielle...are you peeing?"" HAHAHA i was like NO!!!!!!! haha!

"event","<font size=""+1"">:'(</font> <--- does this explain anything? for some odd reason, today i haven't been myself. I've had this weird feeling, it's hard to explain...like emptiness, Loneliness. I may be over reacting, but i can't help my feelings. 

For like tha past 3 days, ive been hangin out wit Kelly and Justin. Wednesday we babysat, and then went bike ridin like all day long. Justin went on strike, cuz his mom wouldn't let him do nething...lol so he wouldn't leave his room. We hadda talk to him through his window lol, and there was a lot of bugs, i got eaten up bad. He then got thristy and didn't want to leave him room...so he gave us money and we went to tha store and got him 2 RC's. We took it bak to him, and i threw them up to his window...Then his dad came up to me (hes AWESOME lol i love his dad) and i went on tha porch and we were both talkin, and finally Justin came out of his room. We sat on his porch for a while, and then me and Kelly went home to eat dinner. We then went for a bike ride later that night wit Lee and we stopped by to see David S. and Some of his family and friends. It was fun...i guess. Later that nite Andy has tha truck so he stopped by to say hi, Haven't seen him in a while. On thursday Me and Lee went bike riding (hes fun to hang with, and he doesn't take advantage of me :)) hes a nice friend! and Kelly and Justin went sumwhere lol. We got home at like 10:15, and me and kelly talked to Andy V. (from Charlotte), Chris and Justin. They were drunk lol and there was a couple interesting converstation haha. Me and Kelly then went out to look at tha stars and so yea, we came bak inside and went to bed. Today...seemed different. my feelings felt all mixed up and i felt empty like their was nothing to me. I felt odd, and i didn't feel like being around and buncha ppl, i wanted to jus got to Elmhurst be outside and swing. Today was Chloe's suprise party i guess, and i feel bad for not going, but my mom didn't get home till late, and i wasn't feelings right, so yea. ""SUPRISE CHLOE"" plz don't be mad. I went up to Elmhurst and Lee came up there and tried to Cheer me up, he noticed rite away that i wasn't actin like myself and so did my family and sum friends online. I had that feelings where i needed to be alone and not around a lot of ppl, and jus think, it was nice ill admit to have sumone to talk to. I was jus really depressed. I wanted to call Lance, but i remembered he was at a friends...so i thought about callin Andy V. but i remembered that he was gunna be gone all day, Andy L. worked and im sure that he didn't wanna listen to me bitch about my day, Chloe and Erica and Kt im sure were either together or else didn't wanan hear it. Idk i guess i shouldn't assume. I'm not that happy rite now so im jus kinda rambling on about non-sense. I got a really bad sun burn on my legs stomach and shoulders earlier today, so im kinda hurting too.

"event","Hey everyone, it's 7:25 A.M. on Sunday, and i was told to be ready for work by 7:30...amazingly i am...but my dad isn't and he decided to sleep till 8:15 so now were forced to be to work by 9:00. I guess that i have to work wit the beverage cart, and then i have to help wit a couple of the banquets that r going on. I have more hours now because my dad fired this kid named Dan, CUZ HE WAS A LOSER, and he put me in all his places :). Every monday now, i have golf lessons, so sooner or later ill be able to kick Ya'll ASSES :-P

Lately ive been really stressed out. Seein as house school is out now, i have to babysit my brother EVERYDAY, and some days it seems like it NEVER ends, and i jus feel like shit, n he makes me undescribably miserable. All week i babysat him till at least 7:00, somedays i was responsible for gettin him to bed on time. It bearly gives me a life, and i feel like hes my own kid. I better be gettin paid well!

Well on thursday the Pistons won, that was a SWEET game. I was here all on my lonesome, but once and a while thats whats needed, i jus needed to chill and relax! It was a lot of fun watchin it tho, cuz the lakers got their asses WHOOPED. <font size=""+1"">IN YOUR FACE JARRETT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</font> haha!

Friday morning, i got up at 6:00 and had to be next door to babysit 15 kids by 7:00. Well i got their and i played a couple games, and then all the kids were all over me all day long. I got to meet Jesse's ex girlfriend Dana, shes ADORABLE!!!! lol Anyways i was their until 5:00, and i made 50.00. Which was definatley, some needed cash haha. I'm hopin that me and Lauren will be able to go shoppin soon :)

Saturday....HAPPY 15TH BIRTHDAY CHLOE :). lol yesterday was Chloe's birthday, and i called her to tell her happy birthday and we ended up talkin for a bit, that was nice, i haven't talked to her in a while. Joey got outta work at 3:15, lol and was supposed to call her at 3:30. He was going to take her to dinner, and then possibly to the mall. Erica and Katie are usin her once again, not unusal, and i feel bad cuz i hate it when ppl do that, it puts u in a BAD situation. Since Chloe had plans, Kelly came over, and we made puppy chow, shaved our legs, rented movies (BTW when we were at the store we ran into Kristen Jenks...haven't seen her in a while :)) Andy came over, and Justin was supposed to but he didn't cuz him mom is being gay, and put him on lock down sayin that he can only go one place a week, even tho, he didn't go NEWHERE yesterday. Idk its kinda confusin, lol but oh well. I guess we'll have to plan better next time so that Kelly can see her man. My mom and dad weren't home that nite so me and Kelly were kinda scared that sumthin was gunna happen, lol. Justin told us that he was gunna come over at 2:30 this morning, but never called. lol ass hole...jp! lol Then ppl kept callin my freakin celly ALL nite long, and it DROVE US INSANE!!!! OMIGOSH!!! lol it was sooooooooooooo annoying!

"event","Today has been like the WORST and LONGEST day EVER...some of it was fun, ill admit, and then it all went down hill. I think that some of it has to do wit PMS and those damn cryin spells, but not all of it is. Today was a half day, and i was in a pretty good mood, and then my dad jus started yellin at me, cuz of some stupid miscomunication on sat. and i got bitched out bout it, i jus wanted to yell, ""ASS HOLE ON MY MY PERIOD AND YOUR NOT HELPING, STOP FUCKIN YELLIN AT ME"" but i didn't and cried all the way to school and until i hadda take a final.

Then i came home, really excited that im FINALLY DONE WIT SCHOOL..HAY'LL YEA :). When i got here me and Beans dropped our stuff off, and walked up to see our fellow teachers from Rich. Then Andy called me and him and Jimmy came and picked us up. We went to my house, i changed and then we went to the mall. I tried on sum clothes, yet im kinda skinny, so when i put on these white Small shorts they fell rite off of me :(. So yea i was gettin frustrated and we left, and dropped Andy off at his Dentist Appt. later, me and Jimmy went and go Wendys and gas, then went bak and got Andy. Then we went over to Justin's house, and i played wit Mandie and Kylie (i think her name was) that was fun :) cuz the guys were bein dicks and kept raisin their voices at me. But then they appoligized and i went home. 

When i got here my dad and i left rite away and went to the chiropractor, was i ever sore. We came home ate, and then were off again, to take Jesse (my brother) to Tee-Ball. He's REALLY good, and im sure that with a lil bit more practice he'll be the star of the team. Came home, and now im here.

For sum reason i feel as if im loosin Chloe, but i don't wanna talk about it on here. I jus feel like Erica and kt are more important. Even tho she thinks that shes loosin me to Kelly and the Sophies, ive always been friends wit em, and theyre AWESOME, and i love bein wit em all, I can't help who i chill wit im sorry :(.

Things for Trajan seem to be sailing quite smoothly. I told you that if you be patient that things will ripen up! (well not those exact same words lol, but ya get the gist). You kno that im always here for you. It's been forever since ive talked to you, where have you been? Well you come to the U.S. soon, and we betta hang out at least once, cuz its hard talkin to ya and not actually gettin to see ya! Kelly asked me to go to ur family reunion, and so i hope that we'll get to all chill there :) WEOOOOOOOO!

Lauren, i jus want to take the time out to tell you that u mean a lot to me, and i don't kno what word descibes you except Perfect, and an AWESOME friend! I love havin you there to talk to about my problems, cuz u always understand, and your exactly like me lol. I can't wait for this summer, it'll be a blast!!! shopping, cookin, movies, junk food, swimmin, amusement parks, parties, dancin, and more. Many memories in the future chick, u kno i love ya!!! take care and dont forget that im always here for you! Thank you for being there for me :) i won't let it bring me down, ill be stronger than that:)

This weekend was fun, on friday Kelly, Andy, Justin, Jimmy, And me all were chillin here at my house, messin around playin basketball...holdin signs out to cars...""GET A MAMOGRAM""...""CHECK YOUR BREASTS MONTHLY"" lol left over signs from this lil Breast cancer walk. Then we all rented movies and watched sum. Andy and Justin left and went to see Harry Potter wit the Sophies and me and Kelly chilled here and watched Love in Basketball, and my lazy self fall asleep lol.

Then on sat. Me, Sam, Mom, Dad, Trent, Scott, Jesse all went golfin, i gotta par on one of the wholes. Sam was tellin me that next year when im playin soccer, imma try and play golf too, mite be hard but i wanna, lol but when i do, at practice for soccer if i walk, coach says ""stop walkin, walkins for golf so join them if you wanna walk"" and i can say, ""i AM playin golf haha"" it mite have had to be one of those HTBT (Had to be there) moments lol. Anyways so yea, wen we got done Dawn and Randy picked me sam and scott up, and we went bak to his house, and he had a lil bonfire thingy wit some friends, i knew most of em which was nice. I got to see Mike...hadn't seen him in a while, missed him, and i got to see Spinosh...lol oh YAY! lol hes a HoOt! lol. I realized that i serioulsy have NO feelings for Scott at all, jus as a friend, that happened about 4 months ago, i  began to realize it, and now its fo sho. I guess that i really seriously only have feelings for one person...u kno who u r :) Neways we came home, and ate a lot of Death by Chocolate Ice cream and then went to bed. I woke up and cleaned the whole house and studied for my final that i had today, which im prayin that i Aced it was REALLY easy so i think i did well.

"event","Today, has been a very boring/depressing day. I really wish that some things in my life could be changed for the good, yet some of them are quite IMPOSSIBLE :'(. 

As most of you kno, i have a really great friend named Lance. He lives in Flushing, and their lays one of my MAIN problems. He means a lot to me, and i really wish that i could be wit him, cuz i kno thats one person that wouldn't hurt me, and that i could be happy with. Most of you guys are probably reading my journal, saying..WOW this girl is confused, and somewhat boy crazy. One of those two are true. Yes i am very confused. and No im not boy crazy, i jus want to find the right person. Lance would be that Perfect person, but the distance, is really wat is hurting me and makin things impossible. 

Lance, i jus want to tell you, all i want is for you to be happy. If looking, and being with another girl is what will do it, then thats what you should do, i want the best for you. I'm always here for you, and i always will be. I love ya bunches, and nothing will EVER change that. Your always there for me when im down, and I thank you for that so much. I'm going to be here for you every step of the way. Take care hun :(.

I was supposed to work but, i woke up sick. Last night, i was feeling like a cold was coming on, but i figured that it was allergies, and this morning, i woke up not being able to breath, and a super sore throat :(.  I'm always sick and it sucks a lot of ass!

On thursday i invited Chloe and Joey to get chinese with us. Then in class she told me that she wasn't going to go. This really made me sad, because i miss her a lot. I seem to never see her ne more. Shes my best friend, and im afraid that im losing her. Maybe im jus worrying to much, but i guess i jus really wish things were better. I jus hope that we get to hang out a lot this summer.

I really have nothing planned today. I wanted to go golfing but i don't foresee that, and im really not that happy and energized rite now. 

I guess i jus feel like a small person in a big world, and its really hard for me to cope wit cuz, i jus want to be happy. One day i will be tho, and nothing will stop me. I jus need to be more confident in myself, and less consious.  Thank you all for everything, means a lot to have such special ppl in my life.

Take care everyone :(,
Danielle

I'm sorry Lance... :("

"event","<font color=""#ff00ff"">Hey </font>my <u>lovely</u> friends. How are you all doing this lovely evening? Today when i was at school i decided to read my journal...lol, and i discovered, wat a shitty writer i am lol. Oh well i can't do nething about that, its jus not my ""<font color=""#00ff00"">thing</font>"" i guess, hehe. 

<font color=""#0000ff"">Yesterday</font>...i got my hair cut, and my highlights were gettin a lil extreme, lookin like i had grey hair. So my mom told my hair stylist to color my hair. He deciced on this Golden Brown, and it was REALLY shiny. Yet, he didn't think that it would turn my hair practically RED :(. Idk wat happened but now its like a shiny, golden brown/red. I came home and cried cuz i thought that it looked really ugly. A lot of ppl told me today at school that it looked good, i jus am really missin my blondeness. I mean my Blonde mind didn't leave me, haha. Idk wat to do,im jus hopin that i can get highlights in it again, that are like a light brown/blonde so that it wont make it as blonde, if ya kno what i mean. I guess that ya'll will have too jus see it for urself, im warning you tho...i look like a reflector in the sun! haha...

We were all playin hacky sack, and they kept hittin my ass wit it, and sayin ""watch it jiggles"", and then Jimmy through the ball REALLY hard, and it hit me really hard in the boob :( it hurt very bad.

"event","Wow, its been a while .For some reason a lot lately i have been depressed, and i haven't been happy.I've been going through a lot of confusin lately, mostly about...the dreadful word..BOYS!

Well on friday...Sam Olsen, Justin Deason, Kelly Blakeslee, Andrew Barclay, Jimmy Garvey, and me, were all jus hanging out in Herner's room at lunch. It was ""senior skip day"" so sam mentioned us skippin to, yet none of us are seniors. So we all decided to leave 5 mins. before lunch ends, and go do the mall. We were wondering aournd, and as we were coming outta the Disney Store, Justin's phone rang, and it was Mrs. Farrell (shes their english teacher), because Shane said that we were skippin so he game her the phone to call us. So Justin told her that we all god food poisoning. She told us to lay in the tub, and take imodium lol. Me and kelly decided to go into Charlotte Russe. We agreed to model clothes for the guys, so they all sat on that lil pink sofa thing in the middle of the store jus watchin us try on clothes. It was the funniest thing EVER..because i mean the least thing u would expect to see in a total girls store...is 4 guys lol. So finally the guys couldn't handle the music nemore, and made us leave. We then went to Hat World and talked to the guys there. Oh and then we went to Old Navy, and i was modeling bathing suits. The guys told me that i looked really good in a bathing suit, and told a buncha ppl at school that, so ppl kept tellin me how they heard and wanted to see for themselves. As we were walkin down the hall, Mall ppl were goin up 2 a lot of ppl, and then they came to us, and were like...""Theres a tornado warning, and we want you to take shelter, you may leave the building if you want, but if not we will let you kno when all is clear"". So we were all freakin out that oh the schools guna find out, we should go bak and...so on and so fourth haha. So we decided to stay there, and we got put in this lil hall way about 1 foot wide. It was CrAzY, lol the funny this is, that we Justin yelled, ""Who ever from Sexton, raise your hand"" and like more then half raised their hand. Then we went exploring and went out this door that led us to the middle of the mall, and there was more ppl from sexton. Then suddenly...Matt Peckhams mom comes up to us and is like...""should you guys be in school?""...all thats going through my head...(FUCK WERE SCREWED) haha. His mom was like, ""well everythings all clear, you guys should get bak to school. because security is taking down names of kids that are skipping."" So we dipped outta there, and went loitering Ponderosa and talked wit Tim Nault. Finally we left there, and then ventured to my house, and stayed here until like 3:00 then half of them went bak to school. It was awesome i had sooooo much fun, i can't wait to tell my kids about it in the future lol. I'll be like ""the first time i skipped we got stuck in a tornado haha""

On to the subject of <b>BOYS :(</b>
Well, as everyone has seen, there has been a few entries in here about Kyle. Well......When i was out friday, Andrew B. told me that sumone that kyle told, said that he was using me for sex. I didnt kno what to do, because when we first started talkin he said that he wouldn't do that, and he wouldn't pressure me into anything. So i didn't even kno wat to think. I talked to Lee about it (his brother) and he told me sum things that i neglect to put in my journal. Later on i talked to Kyle and he told me that, he never would do that, and that he didnt say it, it was prolly jus a guy that was jealous of him cuz we were talkin...hmm, idk tho. So thats kinda hittin me hard, but Lee told me that he doesn't think that Kyle is treatin me the best, and that i should jus be careful.

Then i kinda realized that i still have feelings for Andy. I don't kno wat to do about that, seein as how last time we broke up because he had feelings for me and Gina. I really shouldn't be talkin about this on here tho, cuz some of the stuff i don't want gettin out, seein as how things get spread around quickly.

Then this weekend i had like 8-9 friends over this weekend, and we were all jus hangin out, and there was this dare to kiss Jimmy, i didn't tho cuz i had feelings for other ppl, and it jus wasn't rite, yea hes cute i admit that, but hes jus not my type i guess. So i told sam that, and somehow things got all mixed up, and it got around that i liked Jimmy. So many of ppl were askin me about it today, and now somehow i have to tell him that i don't feel the same way he does for me. So wish me luck. That kinda depressed me today tho, because i was jus mad that everyone new, when ididn't even want it to get that deep. i jus said he was cute. GRRR...im still upset about it, but im not going to go into detail nemore, cuz then ill really get depressed so ill stop.

So yea i really havent been happy lately...and theres more that i can add to all of this, but i won't cuz it kinda gets boring hearing about ones continuous problems. Especially if you don't understand half the stuff/people im referring too.

One person that im really happy for is, Chloe. She's my best friend, and she was going through a really difficult time, letting go of her past relationship, with mr. justin. Finally she has met a new guy...Joe Daniels, and i approve, i met him once and hes a cutie. He has a car, and i believe hes a junior. He makes her <b>EXTREMELY</b> happy, and that means that hes doing his job well! I want to wish you two the best of luck, i'm glad that you found somebody, that your happy with. I love you soooooooooo much chicky NEVER forget that! BTW..ur new hair cut is adorable! <u>ur so beautiful :)</u> 
I wanted to thank Lance, once again, for being there for me through everything. I really enjoy talking to you, and u always no how to turn my frown upside down! :-P im stickin my tounge out at you...haha GRRR thats wat giraffes say ;-), aren't you scared of my knife...hahah! good times good times. You have been through a lot for me, even tornados haha. Thank you for everything that you have done for me, means a lot :). Your very special to me, i love ya!

Next is Trajan. I kno that you have a real difficulty wit consious. We need to work on that haha. Don't worry about things wit Olya, they'll work out trust me ;-). Things will get better, you jus have to remember one thing...Life has its ups and down, don't let that affect you to much, ppl get busy, but sooner or later things will calm down, jus take it easy and hope for the best hun :-D u kno i love ya!

and Lee, thank you for listenin to me bitch about my problems and concerns wit your brother. I love havin u to talk to. We need to hang out again, and remember that ill always be here for you, and maybe one day, ull see me witout my make up haha ;-) jus be patient (something that i don't have)...patients is  a VIRTUE! lol

"event","hey everyone!!!! how are you guys doing lately? i've been doing awesome...a lot better then i was doing over the weekend. I got my new cell phone today, its awesome so call me anytime you want!!! i love talking on the phone as most of you guys should know.  School was <u>boring,</u> but it wasn't like a horrible day or nething i mean schools school rite?

I wasn't havin the best morning ever, because i got a really really runny nose and i got very flustered, and through my water at my pool table. Yes i kno i am a VERY impatient person...as some of you may kno lol. I guess im jus the kind of person that knows wat she wants and will try her hardest until she gets it, or else im bout to start PMSing haha, who knows. So yea, i couldn't get in the shower rite away cuz it was so runny, causing me to have to lye down once again and jus relax, all i wanted to do was get in the shower and use the new Shampoo and Conditioner that came in the mail the day before (YAY Arbonnes here, were bak in business, silky smoooth clean hair.....ahhhhh :-D) but i couldn't cuz of my damn nose...RGGG, lol. So, i finally got in the shower, it delayed me by like 30 mins and so finally i was ready, and then my dad tells me to walk my brother to school. <b>DAMN I WISH I COULD DRIVE!</b> i thought to myself...hair+humidity=FRIZZ (not good at ALL) i had no choice neways so i jus walked and sang to myself. When i got home i ran rite down stairs and fixed my hair lol, Wat can i say, imma girly girl!

As i was walking home today from the bus stop, i was crossing the road, and Jimmy almost hit me. I stood in the road for about 5 mins and talked wit him and Andy, then finished my escapade home! When i got home i found a sticky thingy on my door, it read: ""Sorry we missed you, you can come and pick up your package at FEDex after 6:30 P.M."" So i ran inside and i called my mom and told her!!! In complete excitement, i counted down the minutes till we could go and get it :-D. I got my phone got it all set up and now i am bak in business...oh ya!!!!!)

I talked to Trajan today, he helped me to understand everything that has been going on, and he showed me some points that i never realized before. Thank you for your help. I am glad that i have you to talk to :) i love ya!

Also seeing as how i have my cell i can call Lance as much as i want lol. Hes so much fun to talk to on the phone, and one of the many guys that likes/enjoys doing it! Thank you for all that you have done, i love that i have you there to talk to whenever i need NETHING! I can't wait till you fix my comp. lol! Take care im always here for you! love ya bunches!

One more person i wanted to make a shout out to is Andy. I kno that you and i have been through a lot, and it's been hard on both of us. I jus want you to understand that i am always here for you, and that no matter wat u will always have a place in my heart. You always make me laugh, and for sum reason i always fall for you simple yet very modest jokes. What can i say imma gullable person haha. Well good luck wit everything, and always remember to be happy :) Keep a smle on that face of yours! love ya :)

"event","I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that <b>I-love-you</b> I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby
I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might ruin you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

"event","<b><font color=""#00ffff"">Hey everyone</font></b>...its been quite a while since i have updated my journal, since then quite a bit has happened :). I had a lotta tests this week, and a lot of human interaction/social life you could say. I've become to really enjoy the song ""<font color=""#ff0000"">burn</font>"" -Usher...When kelly came over once she brought his new cd, and i have to admit that i wasn't to fond of it. But the more and more that i have heard that song, the more and more i have grown to enjoy it, so currently that is my favorite song. It always reminds me of Kyle, because whenever im in the car wit him, that song is always playin lol. 

Yesterday (Thursday) mom and i had quite a bit of errons to run, go to Sears, then Meijers, then meet grandpa in Perry (Jesse was going up north so we hadda drop him off), then the best part...going to get <b>my new cell phone</b> :). I had been callin verizon over the past couple of days, and Sha'Lean was his name lol. He was really funny, and he told me that i was beautiful, and to watch out for guys like him, lol. We were just talking about my phone and the new plan, and finally it was time to go, so im walkin to the door, and the guys followin me, and i go to like leave real quick...and *<font size=""+1""><b><u><font color=""#0000ff"">BAM</font></u></b></font>*, i run into the door. (<font color=""#00ff00"">Blonde Moment haha</font>). The door was locked...smart eh?

Anyways, today was a overall pretty good day, it had its ups and downs, and rite now its on its way down. At lunch Andy and a couple of his friends told the security guard that i was a prostitute and he freakin believed them lol. Then i called him a fagget, and he pulled me down the hall by my legs. I got home, chilled i was kinda bored and it was really really hott.

This is where things begin to become bad. Lee and i were talkin, and he said that he wanted to go to taco bell, and i said idk if its smart seein as how im talkin to your brother, he told me that things would be fine, and that he shouldn't care that much, seein as how we both liked diff. ppl and only understood eachother to be JUST strictly friends. So we went to taco bell, we got home, we hung out wit my mom...<u><font size=""+1""><font color=""#ffff00"">WE DID NOTHING</font></font></u>...then the Pistons were on so of course we had to watch them (they deserve their own paragraph, so i will put that one down a lil bit farther). Then he went home. I felt really bad about not doing nething wit kyle and i had this feeling...like i missed him. I asked Lee a couple of ?'s about Kyle, and he proceeded to tell me. After the game was over Lee went home, and i got online...here i am! Kyle was on and we kinda got into it about the whole situation between me and Lee, and now i feel really horrible for even considering the offer. All i want Kyle to kno is that i DON'T see Lee like that, wat so ever, i really care about him, and i hope that this little hill can be resolved, and there are better things to come in the future. *hoping/praying*

Now for the Pistons, it was a <b><font color=""#ff0000"">SUPER</font></b> awesome game, unfrotuneatley they lost tho...final score was 127-120, Pistons down by 7. The reason why it was such an excellent game was because, they pistons were behind like 3 points, and at the buzzer Chauncey Billups shot a 3 pter!!! it was freakin awesome, which tied the game taking them into over time. Neither of the teams were really scoring, and ended up in a tie again, takin them into Double Over Time. once again, neither of the teams were scoring, and there were a lot of fouls, and again, they were tied, takin them into Triple Over Time...rite about now i was gettin frustrated cuz the pistons were ahead so they began to slack off thinkin that they were going to win, then wen they were below they started tryin to hard. Tension was really building up, and my heart was pounding extremely fast. Finally the Nets were continusley shooting, and ended up ending the game ahead 7 points.
<font color=""#ff0000""><font size=""+1"">*<font color=""#00ff00"">VERY VERY VERY...EXTREMELY DEPRESSING</font>*</font></font>

I wanted to take out the time to also tell Lance, thank you for everything, <b>u do mean a lot to me</b>, and im so glad that i have sumone to lean on whenever im depressed and no one is there. I love ya and it really means a lot to me that i have ya with me. Danke' :-D 

Next i wanted to say sumthin thats very needed. Chloe i just want you to kno, that you are my best friend, im here for you throught anything, thick or thin. I want you to kno that you can call me whenever u need <u>ANYTHING</u>!!! cuz all i want is to be there for you, and make you happy. I really hope that u find the right guy, jus make sure that you take things slowly, and don't rush into anything to quickly. I love ya bunches and PLZ never forget that! thank you for everything :-D

Also, i wanted to say <font size=""+1""><b><font color=""#00ffff"">HAPPY BIRTHDAY ERICA</font></b></font>...

Lotta good memories, and i hope that you have an excellent birthday...be safe chicky, and don't ever forget that i love ya!. Thank you for everything!

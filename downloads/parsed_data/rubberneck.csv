And the pictures are pretty, but having been through a bunch of fandom formats, I&rsquo;m well aware of the pros and cons of this one even as I&rsquo;m still learning how this one plays out.<br /><br />The format of Tumblr is incredible for visuals, which is great for artists as well as folks who like to work with graphics or make gifsets and such.  I still have a photobucket account I only got to upload graphics to LJ--an assache I&rsquo;m glad to be rid of.<br /><br />I like how music mixes are a thing now, easily cross-platformed with 8tracks.  I&rsquo;ve always made mixes, and there&rsquo;s an easier channel to share them now.<br /><br />I find attribution difficult to track, which I think is one thing that feeds into the feeling that content just appears magically.  <strong>Posts don&rsquo;t have a home, by design.</strong><br /><br />I regret the ephemeral nature of the tumblr medium, it&rsquo;s curation of a stream of consciousness; blogs and journals accumulated more readily visible character in the way of links to fic/deviant art/websites, memory posts, people&rsquo;s accustomed icons, etc.<br /><br />Reading pages and threaded comments are social networks in action, it&rsquo;s space for conversation and getting to know people.  <br /><br />I think exploring how we can cross-pollinate and get the best of what each has to offer is WHAT FANDOM DOES!  It doesn&rsquo;t die, but it does break apart and scatter and find more fertile ground for what it wants to do--which is why tumblr took off in the first place, for the benefits above.  But it&rsquo;s a rocky salty environment for meta and fic.<br /><br />Tumblr is like trying to have a salon discussion by way of the game of telephone.<br /><br /><a href=""http://handypolymath.tumblr.com/post/127432129064/all-this-talk-about-unpopular-writers-reminds-me"">Cross-posted to my Tumblr</a>

Is my rec totally subjective because Thassalia <span style=""line-height: 1.4;"">wrote this for me, channeling pure plasma electricity like a lightning rod? Eh, perhaps.</span>

It&#39;s also amazing, spot-on, complicated and hot, gorgeous and lush and makes me so glad I not only get to read her, but floored i get to write with her, and honored to get to spend time with her brains, beyond tasty and off into ambrosia.

Summary:<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s truly a fantasy, and one she could spin, for him, but spies don&rsquo;t work like that -- in breathless, charged teams. They need steady hands, even heart rates. And if she were somewhere she thought she&rsquo;d get caught she&rsquo;d just leave, or lie. Eliminate the threat one way or another.&quot;</p>
~*~

Spycraft and control and letting someone peek behind the curtain...and monsters playing high-stakes hide and seek with their hearts.

Also Mr. F came home, so it's a natural stopping point.

I did find some things to try on Mr. F's hip, which will hopefully help until we can get him into some real physical therapy. &nbsp;Nerve flossing! &nbsp;Pin and stretch techniques! &nbsp;Massaging perpendicular to the muscle and connective fibers to provide shear forces! &nbsp;How awesome to find videos that not only address the anatomy involved but also have captions of study references!

In other news, the kittens are fucking bonkers tonight.

On skin it takes a turn toward Irish Spring, and ultimately the experience is less like smelling the soap and more like getting your mouth washed out with it. &nbsp;I may be biased against aldehydes.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://www.bpal.org/topic/9477-mantis/"">Mantis</a> <em>[discontinued]&nbsp;Crushed herbs and sweet amber resin with a streak of patchouli, neroli and golden musk&nbsp;</em><br />The patchouli and amber keep it interesting, but the majority of the scent quickly goes powdery soft, which is okay but not my beautiful cake--possibly the neroli or the golden musk is what's going powdery? &nbsp;I'm still trying to pin these notes down, and figure out how they tend to behave.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://www.bpal.org/topic/763-psyche/"">Psyche</a>&nbsp;<em>[discontinued]&nbsp;Bulgar rose, Chinese white musk, lavender, orchid and frankincense&nbsp;</em><br />Shouts rose for five minutes, then turns to lavender and something floral joined by a soft musk that is sneeze-inducing. &nbsp;I washed it off within fifteen minutes. Both sneezing and washing are rare for me, but given my reluctance to go down the laundry aisle as a child (and even now), I'm pretty sure it's the white musk and/or lavender to blame.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/godfather-death/the-lights-of-mens-lives/"">The Light of Men's Lives</a>&nbsp;<em>The wax and smoke of millions upon millions of candles illuminating the walls of Death's shadowy cave: some tall, straight, and strong, blazing with the fire of life, others dim and guttering.</em><br />I like the idea of this, and in the vial it's a malty honey scent. &nbsp;But BPAL's beeswax/honey notes often turn into a high-pitched dissonant screech on me, and sadly, if I don't swap this I'll keep trying it and giving myself a headache when it shatters into olfactory reverb.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/mad-tea-party/against-idleness-and-mischief/"">Against Idleness &amp; Mischief</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Pollen-dusted honey, diligent tonka, steadfast chamomile, and goodly hyssop</em>&nbsp;<br />In this case the screechy honey is tugged to a sweetly herbal place by the hyssop; unfortunately the chamomile adds its dried pee funk. &nbsp;The extreme drydown was tolerable, but that could just be relief at it ending.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/halloween-2014/fog-machine-juice/"">Fog Machine Juice</a>&nbsp;<em> ['single note' no description on site]</em><br />I get where this is supposed to go, very lightweight but with an edge that calls to mind the catch in the throat that machine fog gives. &nbsp;But it goes completely chemical on me, best described by the family comments: <br />(kid): &nbsp;It smells soapy.<br />(spouse): &nbsp;'I just bought a pallet of deodorant candles for my hotel'.</lj-cut>

"event","It's been ten years since I read The Big Sleep for the first time. &nbsp;What strikes me is the anachronisms--not in the original story, but in my recollections of the story vs. how it hits me now.

I became politically aware in the Reagan era, and I used to think that the 80's would be looked back on as a decade where the culture changed as much as in the 60's. &nbsp;This was so wrong. &nbsp;There were no watershed lines where deep ideas fundamentally changed in the 80's. &nbsp;In fact, I've grown to appreciate how much things were still in flux when I was an anklebiter in the 70's, that a healthy portion of the truths I cut my teeth on were in fact revolutionary for many of the humans who were already here.

We're in the midst of that kind of cultural change right now. &nbsp;I know, because when I read this 1939 novel in 2004, some of the lenses I was looking through have been discarded, updated, rotated and flipped like a fucking optometrist's been rearranging the optics. &nbsp;Some of it is that I have ten more years of life under my belt, and some of that's been spent writing. &nbsp;But culturally, I'm looking across the valley from a different hill.

I'm seeing more of what's going on in the story. &nbsp;I'm also seeing some of the deep beliefs and truths in that culture that pen the story in, give it shape, compel the characters, and are also, in nascent cynical breezy form, being sketched and examined by Chandler. &nbsp;There are seeds in this of the time I'm in now, ideas either timeless or back in fashion, but on the main it feels more like a historical piece at age 75 than it did at 65.

It sounds ridiculous to say, but I can't help thinking about how the Kiddo views her world, at almost eight years in, and realizing how many assumptions and broken truths are in this novel that you'd have to explain to fully grok character motivation.

Maybe I'm just floored to realize that stories I used to take in without noticing now require mental stretching to process, because the culture of my childhood &nbsp;has become dated to the point of needing footnotes. &nbsp;It's like when I realized that 'adulthood' no longer carried the pervasive note of cigarette smoke it did when even nonsmokers had to waft through clouds of it in every public space and most private ones. &nbsp;The day comes closer when I too will mortally embarrass my descendants with anachronistic biases and neon flashing signs that I grew up in the last fucking century.

And so, I toddle off to bed.

"event","So I saw the tail end of Spielberg's &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; on a high-def television the other day, and aside from the bad pacing, Cruise's dated acting, and the fact they pulled the whole damned punch of the story (I don't care how anti-science this culture has gotten, microbes are not a fucking epilogue tag, they're the goddamned punchline!), what really struck me was this: <strong>crisp high-def screens break the fourth wall for me.</strong><br /><br />Maybe it's an artifact of being horrifically nearsighted, preferring the world with some of the rough edges filed down. &nbsp;Maybe it's that the visuals are so present it only emphasizes the things that aren't real, the missing textures or wear and grit, the hollowness underneath the cliche suggestions of reality. &nbsp;I'm there on the set, and I can tally up each feckless effort put into trying to convince me otherwise. &nbsp;Or perhaps because it's shoved in my face, I expect it to carry more storytelling weight, and it often tells me more about the Industry than the Story.<br /><br />Thing is, I don't demand visual realism. &nbsp;Babylon 5, aside from the writing and acting which is uneven but has moments of aplomb, is very clearly happening on a sound stage: the costumes are not lived-in pieces, the lighting is straightforward, and the sound simplistic. &nbsp;The walls don't have weight, the spaces don't have the proper echo, but it very rarely throws me out of the story. &nbsp;Because it's not pretending to any deep layers of texture or depth, it aims for, and reads as, space opera theater.<br /><br />Hell, I rewatched Star Trek TOS last fall and adored all the funky delightful ways they were using fabrics, found objects, and gels on the lights to make a handful of severe gunmetal grey rooms interestingly'spacey'. &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/MyImmortalWebSeries"">(My) Immortal: The Web Series</a>&nbsp;clearly happens on a relative shoestring in a handful of borrowed locations and is chockablock with visual characterization and commentary.<br /><br />I like to pick out things like lighting, make-up, set design, mise en scene and atmosphere. &nbsp;I notice when the make-up takes character into account, and it warms the very cockles of my heart. &nbsp;On the flip side, I notice with disdain when every woman on a show sports the same make-up; it's as creepy and repulsive as eating in a restaurant where you can see every waitress is the manager's type. &nbsp;I appreciate it when the bruising and blood after a fight are not ruggedly placed to bring out blue eyes or white teeth, but instead are the raw smeared mess that makes a person look like a snotty bawling toddler crying blood tears. &nbsp;I love it when a rainy scene is followed by a scene where it's stopped raining, but the tires make a wet hiss on the street. &nbsp;I notice the implied space described by the echo or lack thereof in a room. &nbsp;I like seeing dust motes. &nbsp;I notice depth of field and how it's applied.<br /><br />There is so much more to visual storytelling than dialing up the contrast so the actor's very pores are screaming for attention underneath a trite swab of grease paint.&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" /><br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" /><br />

On skin, there's a spicy sweetness which the spouse identifies as, &quot;smells vegetal&quot;, and reminds me a bit of allspice.  A pleasant musk wafts in and out, but the main effect is a spiced rum and bar coke with the syrup mix a bit off (sans ethanol).  Enjoyable, actually.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/bewitching-brews/kill-devil/"">Kill-Devil</a>  <em>sugar cane, molasses, oak wood, and honey</em><br />In the vial it's molasses and watermelon.  Watermelon? Yes, oddly, my brain keeps labeling part of this as watermelon.  On the skin it becomes warm sweet potato pie deliciousness.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/mad-tea-party/jabberwocky/"">Jabberwocky</a>  <em>pine, eucalyptus and orange</em><br />This scent is clearly mentholated and piney, but is not cold.  On the skin it's eucalyptical pine with a vapor of mineral orange, and I like it.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.luckyscent.com/product/15293/explosions-d-emotions-amour-nocturne-by-l-artisan-parfumeur"">L'Artisan Parfumeur: Amour Nocturne</a>   <em>cedar, milk accord, caramel, gun powder, orchid </em><br />Caramel anchored by gunpowder, with cedar at the edge.  The scent sticks very close to skin, like I've become a warm old cedar chest filled with wax-wrapped candies and black powder.  Dolce de fireworks.<br /><br /><a href=""http://theperfumedcourt.com/Products/Kerosene-Black-Vines__KEROVINES.aspx"">Kerosene: Black Vines</a> <em> ivy, fig, star anise, cinnamon, Canadian fir, balsam of Peru, tonka, incense, vanilla</em><br />In the vial it smells like the baby Tylenol drops my little brother was dosed with in the early 80's.  On skin the licorice is intense and edgy, but mellows away from black jellybeans and into something dark and delightful.  The fir comes in like a savory spearmint, there's a gloss of sweetness, and the whole effect is like a fine metal fleck paint in a black that frosts deep purple in the sun.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/wanderlust/amsterdam/"">Amsterdam</a>  <em>tulips, peony, fresh flowing water and crisp green grasses</em><br />In the vial it's a post-shower scent of humidity and Olay soap.   On skin it slides into a soapy floral, but remains fresh, as if the condensation is dissipating off the bathroom mirror and the scent is clean skin and the breeze off the peony bushes just outside.  Not sure if I want to smell like my mom coming out of the shower, but it certainly paints a picture in my brain.<br /><br />BPAL The Schoolhouse (discontinued) <em>dandelion, white clover, balsam fir logs and birchwood switches </em><br />Clover and fir with some whiff of dandelion but no discernible birch in the vial.  On skin the scent is well-blended and hard to part out into notes, but delightful all the way through the drydown.  Clover and/or dandelion smell awesome on me.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalogue/umbra/"">Umbra</a>  <em>East African black patchouli, </em><em>cedarwood, vetiver and a dribble of cinnamon</em><br />In the vial it's fluffy black rain-soaked soil. On skin it unfolds a bit.  I think I recognize the partnership of patchouli and vertiver from Jicky, and the cedar and cinnamon harmonize warmly in the drydown.  The cinnamon is very faint, but it's like the white dot highlight on a painted eye, it nails the scent.  This is warm air caught under enveloping tree branches during a pelty rain, like a bubble of summer under a capsized boat.<br /><br />BPAL <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalogue/delphi/"">Delphi</a>  <em>The smoke of sacred incense of Apollo twined through laurel branches, bay, and honey wine</em><br />In the vial I'm tentatively identifying laurel, with honey and a thrum of bay.  The incense is nimble instead of ponderous, like when the resinous grains don't combust but simply vaporize as soon as they hit the charcoal--yet the tree herbs keep the scent kind of raw.  The tangy honey and resin create a hologram of rose, an olfactory illusion where close up the honey and incense are both themselves, but a few feet from the skin they create an interference pattern that reads 'rose'.  It's weird and enjoyable, but also lingers for at least ten hours and is therefore a commitment. <br /><br />BPAL Psyche (discontinued) <em>Bulgar rose, Chinese white musk, lavender, orchid and frankincense </em> <br />Rants ROSEGODDAMNIT!! for about five minutes, then keels over into lavender and something floral, shrouded by a soft musk that is sneeze-inducing.  I think this scent just went &quot;Psych!&quot; to me.  Or it had a delusional break and is now languishing unto death in a locked attic.  I washed it off within fifteen minutes. Very rare for me to get the sneezes.  Even rarer to me to bail on a scent no matter how weird or funky.</lj-cut>

"event","Twenty and a half years ago, I adopted a kitten with a strange sense of humor.

She'd turn off the bathroom light when you were pooping.

She'd wait until you were drifting to sleep, and press a cold wet nose against the middle of your back--and when you'd startle, &quot;Gah!&quot; she'd hop away with a tribble-like burble.

She'd stand on your chest and after a thorough petting, look right at you and go, &quot;Woof.&quot;

The cat has had health issues and then rallied several times over the last four years. &nbsp;She's been okay lately: affectionate, good appetite, mainly using her box. &nbsp;We've been bathing her, most recently last weekend, and while she'd been normally feisty, she did pant for a few minutes afterward when I had her wrapped in the towel.

She rebounded quickly, and even gave herself some token licks in the offended manner of a affronted cat.

She was in good spirits last night, and ate with her usual gusto. &nbsp;She woke me up at 5am with nuzzly kisses and a request for food, and I gave her petting and told her she'd be fed a little later. &nbsp;We offer wet food twice a day, and there's always a bowl of kibble available. &nbsp;At 10am, I realized that was the last I'd seen of her.

We've turned the house inside out several times, and also the yard and the neighbor's bushes. &nbsp;She's exclusively indoor, but just in case she slipped out somehow. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;The wet food we set out is untouched. &nbsp;Dusk is coming, and I'll give it another round of calling in case she rouses or rallies.

If the box never opens, the waveform will never collapse.

"event","&nbsp;Things I've done so far in 2014 instead of working on the novel:<br /><br />1. spent many hours fiddling with my <a href=""http://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/"">BPAL </a>spreadsheet wherein I review the twenty-seven imps I have (analysis tab), filter and sort my wishlist (survey tab), and compile my next parsimonious order of imps (specimens tab).<br /><br />2. knit two slouchy hats and a <a href=""http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEw11/PATTjoanie.php"">sweater</a>, crocheted the components of a small afghan, and a net bag to hold the pieces until they're put together.<br /><br />3. read &quot;The Fourth Turning&quot; by Howe and Strauss, which is an intriguing narrative. &nbsp;I can see how seasonal generational temperaments could be a thing, but it's also a precious time capsule of a retro-future envisioned before 9/11. &nbsp;I want to put the book into a cage match with Taleb's &quot;The Black Swan&quot;. &nbsp;I think their angry-sex lovechild spawn could be the closest we come to Asimov's impossible 'psychohistory'.&nbsp;<br /><br />4. watched a fair amount of &quot;Good Eats&quot;, &quot;Parks &amp; Recreation&quot; and Sophia Loren movies.<br /><br />One the plus side, I have a sweater and I smell interesting. &nbsp;Also, I've made it once again through the depths of winter without going off the rails or losing steam entirely. &nbsp;And I've mostly avoided the head trip of guilt and recrimination about the Important Shit I Should Be Doing. &nbsp;So I'm calling it a win and deciding to move on.<br /><br />Things I need to change wrt writing:<br /><br />1. thinking about the hot mess of a first draft I have so far (with occasional forays into the other first drafts also moldering on the shelf), which only engenders a daunting despair.<br />Solution: Don't look down.<br /><br />2. expecting quality to come without making the effort of quantity.<br />Solution: Shut up and climb.<br /><br />Sometimes the first step is simply owning the fact that you haven't been walking lately, and that's okay, and then getting on with it.<br type=""_moz"" />

"event","But it will take forever for her to drink. &nbsp;Belated thanks to those who recommended I start with the second season, though for me it didn't really click until three or four episodes in--now I'm trying my best not to inhale it all in a week.<br /><br />Of course, my love for Amy Poehler began with the Upright Citizens Brigade, so it always felt wrong when I bounced off the first season of Parks &amp; Rec. &nbsp;So all is right with the world except for one damned thing:<br /><br />Ron Swanson.<br /><br />I have a very strict &quot;no moustaches&quot; rule, as my dad has sported a classic Magnum P.I. moustache since the Nixon administration. &nbsp;I can kiss nearly every other permutation of van dyke or beard, just not that. &nbsp;It's not a daddy issue per se, simply the fact that the brush of upper fuzziness is both comforting and very distinctly platonic. &nbsp;It's like someone wearing your beloved grandma's perfume.<br /><br />And yet, the compelling attraction to Nick Offerman. &nbsp;<br /><br />Anyhoo--I'm just finishing up season two, and am very happy indeed that I gave it another chance.<br /><br />Thank you, fandom!<br type=""_moz"" />

"event","As a generally composed and easy-going person, there tends to come a moment when someone who is getting to know me realizes that, yes, as a matter of fact I <strong>can </strong>manage confrontation pretty well. &nbsp;In most instances without breaking my veneer of detached calm. &nbsp;It's a mental martial art I learned in my thirties, this ability to pick my battles instead of letting others do so, and then following through ruthlessly. &nbsp;The more I practice it, the less stress I have in my life.<br /><br />It's a virtuous circle. &nbsp;When life hands you shit, don't eat the shit. &nbsp;You may have to use it build a fucking cob house to live in for a while, and burn it for fuel, but just don't eat the damned stuff. &nbsp;So the next time you're handed a steaming pile, you're at least dry and kinda warm and you aren't poisoned by a bellyful of someone else's crap.<br /><br />Because yes, there's always a next time. &nbsp;But I'm learning, as I did crossing the flyer-infested quad back in college, that someone trying to hand you X does not equate to you taking X into your hand.<br /><br />It always gives me a perverse satisfaction when someone who's mistaken easy-going for passive goes down the wrong path of the decision tree, is brought up short, and then fucking loses it to no effect whatsoever. &nbsp;Their rage is just so much sunlight trying to move a mountain.<br /><br />I used to be the sunlight in such situations, blazing away and only blistering off a layer of lichen. &nbsp;It's delightful to be solid granite in the shape of my choosing.<br type=""_moz"" />

"event","Semi-deep thoughts as I coddle my weary bones on a day off. &nbsp;Snow shoveling with proper technique can save you from injury, because it spreads all that soreness around equally.<br /><br />I'm wired with both eidetic and state-dependent memory, but I also merciless dump things out of cache, purging and archiving so deep it might as well be gone. &nbsp;So memories are sometimes like time-capsules I'd forgotten were buried until I tour a neglected patch of earth or spelunker a mental basement for an unrelated reason. &nbsp;With the bone-chilling weather lately, I'm walking through a sea of childhood nostalgia as well. &nbsp;It seems to me the cars should be bigger and more square than they are, like a part of my brain is traveling in time because I'm integrating sense memories I haven't accessed in a very long while.<br /><br />The crunch of tires on snow, compressing it under tonnage into an undulating layer of ice, (the metal rattle of lunchboxes on an iced driveway in an improvised bocci-style game), the wrench of icicles catching just enough sunlight to detach and shatter on the porch, (the echoed waveforms of each of my parents stomping their boots clean on the landing between side door and basement stairs, an aural fingerprint of only that person in only that place). &nbsp;Sound takes on a brittleness and contrast in a cold dry atmosphere, like stripped branches inked against colorless sky, and the behaviour of sound changes again when it begins to snow.<br /><br />I hadn't forgotten these things after all. &nbsp;I just hadn't remembered that I'd remembered.<br /><br />I need to brew more tea, and perhaps knit myself a hat.<br type=""_moz"" />

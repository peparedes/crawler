"event","Things have been wierd for me lately. Trying to change my life up, do something different, move back home, get back to being happy, because lets face it, ive been pretty miserable the past 8 months or so.

Throughout all of this, one thing, one plan, one agreement remained constant. No matter how horrible things got i could rely on that. Well now that has been dissolved, which very much upsets me.

Im not mad, im not even the slightest bit pissed. Depressed; a little, not as much as i thought i would be. Disappointed; very. Its sad that something can just be dismissed so easily. Anywho, things/my relationships with certain people will never be the same. I wish it werent like that but thats what its looking like.

Anywho, noone in the world will understand what im talking about, but just wanted to let everyone know that Im kinda feeling a little down right now, and just bear with me, ill be ok again very soon. just need to collect my thoughts and figure out a plan of attack. Im not goin anywhere, ill still be doin my thing and still be in touch with everyone so dont go thinking im gonna run off into my hole like i used to. i just may not be as chipper and helpful as usual. just give it a couple days and ill be makin everyone smile again."

"event","So I've been working a lot lately, in more ways than one. 

I've been working in the classic sense of the word, just keeping my nose to the grindstone and such. Really just trying to keep my head above water. I'm doing alright at my job, making enough money, getting all my stuff done. I just really don't like it. I kinda get the feeling I've been getting treated unfairly because I am my father's son. Not by the employees,&nbsp; but by him. I tend to be the &quot;dog that gets kicked&quot; in a sense.

I've also been working on a couple other things. Firstly, moving back to Houston. I'm a fish out of water here. I don't get along with most of the people, I don't have anything to do, and I tend to be a little dark and twisted for most of the folks here. I really miss all my miscreant friends. I've been working on some new music as well, kinda messing around on the bass as well as the usual lyric writing I always do.

Plus I'm really trying to figure out a way to go to college. I wanna go to a school where i can get a music business degree or something comparable but specialized toward the music industry. I don't wanna go to a 4 year school and get a business degree with a minor in music because that really does nothing to help me in the industry. I've looked into Full Sail University. It really looks like a bad ass school and I would really like to go there, but just the Associates program is 48 grand. The bachelors would be an additional 33 grand. Sorry but i just dont have that kinda scratch.

Idk. I'm well on my way to moving back home. I have the better part of my savings goal met for moving home. Now I just need to line up a place to live, as well as a job, and I'll be ready to go. 

Well that's all I can think of at the moment. Laters."

"event","life, a collection of random events and circumstances that we deal with on a day to day basis. 

meaning, having definition, purpouse or point

does your life have meaning? most people's lives dont, they work a job that they hate so they can pay the bills, when in reality, there are more importanat things than doing what youre told, and following the norm.

theres individuality, happiness, love, family, and fun. 

if you spend your whole life following a set example of what you should do and who you should be, and simply strive to be normal, you will never be happy. and in turn will never understand life nor give the life you've been given any meaning. 

you must strive to be an individual, break the mold and not be part of the collective, because how will anyone tell you apart if you do the same things and look just like everyone else. you will forever simply be a sheep just like everyone else.

happiness, love, and fun are all related. they are all things that are essential to leading a successful and meaningful life. i try and get the three, but i can only seem to have 2 at a time. 

family is something that is also essential to a meaningful life. you need family, whether it be biological, or just people that you are close with and consider family. either way you need people you can talk to and trust and rely on to help you through hard times.

So the question is simple...do you lead a meaningful life? do you surround yourself with the things and people that give you the afore mentioned things? and if not, do you have desire to make your life meaningful? these are things we all ponder at times. we all want to have meaning to our lives, so my advice to you is simply be yourself, and sont forget that any day could be your last. will the people you knew, loved and trusted see your life as meaningful? if your life ended, would you be able to look back and say it was meaningful?

Live every day like it were your last. Hold onto the ones you love because you may never get to hold them again, and most importantly, dont forget that you are who you are, dont try and be anyone else, make yourself someone you want to be no matter the costs."

things have gotten better, i can admit my weaknesses and attempt to improve them, i have accepted defeat, and i have prioritzed so that now i no longer sweat the bullshit.

but things have also taken a downward turn and i pray he spiral does not go much further. i have regained an old aquaintance, one that i do not much like, and unlike most people or things, has and will be with me the rest of my life. depression. 

just when i thought i had it in remission, it rears its ugly head once again. and for just about the same reason, lonliness. i have been and will probably be bitterly alone for some time now. after being single for 5 months, the longest period in about 3 years, i had almost kicked the codependency, but then everything got messed up by a movie, and excellent movie, but a movie nonetheless. 

Garden State. i saw it for the first time, and it made me want to feel the breath of someone dear to me, it made me miss the smile of someone you love, it made me wish i could feel that energy of a deep passionate kiss, things that until now, i had forgotten that i loved. things that i used to be so farmiliar with and now am without and have no conception of how to ever recieve them again. 

i am utterly alone. i miss my friends, i miss my fun life, and most of all i miss love. the most painfully euphoric thing ive ever felt."

"event","You never knew 
well i never told you... 
Everything I know about breaking hearts 
I learned from you, it's true 
I've never done it with the style and grace you have 
But I've made long term plans 
based on these mistakes 

Tell all the English boys you meet 
about the American boy back in the states 
The American boy you used to date 
who would do anything you say 
Tell all the English boys you meet 
about the American boy back in the states 
The American boy you used to date 
who would do anything you say 

And even if her plane crashes tonight 
she'll find some way to disappoint me, 
by not burning in the wreckage, 
or drowning at the bottom of the sea 
Jess, I still taste you, and thus reserve my right to hate you 
And all this empty space that you create 
does nothing for my flawless sense of style 
It's 8:45 (it's 8:45), the weather is getting better by the hour (rains all the time) 
I hope it rains there all the time 
And if you ever said you miss me then don't say you never lied 
I'm without you 


So is that what you call a getaway? 
Tell me what you got away with 
Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish 
I've seen more guts in eleven-year-old kids 
Have another drink and drive yourself home 
I hope there's ice on all the roads 
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt 
and again when your head goes through the windshield 
Is that what you call tact? 
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back 
So let's end this call and end this conversation 
And is that what you call a getaway? 
Tell me what you got away with 
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed 
when you say ""best friends"" means friends forever 

theres so much more that i want you to hear, there is so much more that i need to say, but i dont have the heart to break you like youve broken me."

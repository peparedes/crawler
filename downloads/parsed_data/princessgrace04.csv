"event","This is the first time in a long time that I have gotten to look back upon my life.  Not that my life has come to an end, but it has taken some strange turns.  As I reflect, it is hard to imagine how depressed I actually was.  I think that my mental state has come a long way.  I wonder if it is because I am really better, or is it because I just got good at telling myself I am better.  Does one ever really recover?  I feel like I fight food and depression like a tired superhero.  Sometimes it gets too much but, by page 25, I have fought it all away.  

Do you want to hear something funny?  As time progressed MF became like a little brother to me.  HA!  All of those tears and all of the pain progressed into complete platonic feelings.  I really am slightly repulsed by the thought of hooking up with him.  He is so not my type.  What did I ever see in him?  Why did I put myself through all of that for so many years?  How did I lose 16 lbs in two weeks!?!  I saw that I wrote that.  I wouldn't mind doing that again!  

So kids, where does that leave me?  Happy?  Don't know yet.  I think that I will always battle the ""mean reds"".  I doubt that I can or will ever be able to be 100%.  Hopefully I play the part so well that no one ever notices.  I doubt it but there is still help.  Still time.  Time seems to heal everything.  Right?"

"event","So here it goes.  I have been avoiding my lj due to the plain fact that I didn't want to talk about MF.  I really really want something better to talk about after 3+ years of spilling my raw emotions over someone who clearly doesn't know what he wants.  BUT after avoiding talking about MF the situation got even worse.  I just kept sucking in my feelings into this abyss which turned out to be already full with work crap.  

OK did I mention that I take my test for the last time tomorrow?  I want to be this positive creature and I keep pretending to be, but I think it only works if you are really positive inside.  Is it because this is not really what I want?  Do I just want to run back to the security of home and be with the people that ran away from (by the way that is none of you).  I just don't want to let my family down.  I know it shouldn't be about that but it is.  It is this heavy burden of being their only child and I was suppose to be this big success.  I was suppose to shine.  Granted, I did very well in college but they just expected me to know my path and didn't give a dame about helping me find it.  I reached out to them so many times and all they would say is that I didn't want to be a loser back in Pawleys.  And now when I am flailing all they can say is that they offered me the opportunity to go to graduate school and I chose my path.  I keep telling them that I didn't really want this path but they left me no choice.  When I said that I wanted to stay in Charleston for a little bit and figure it out they said no way.  Now they are blaming me for waisting their money.  It isn't totally my fault and talking to them is like talking to a wall.  It is like sticking a pin into a balloon.  If you do it slowly it will still stay together but the min that you fuck up it pops.  

Well, this balloon is about to pop.

Well, no I can handle this but it is just so much stuff.  Should I even tell you about MF?  I mean not that you can't already guess.  He loves me and then he doesn't.  He wants to work things out but then he doesn't.  I tell him to go away and he doesn't.  I tell him to stay and he doesn't.  Do you see a pattern here?  There is always something new.  

So here are my fears that I can't seem to get rid of...
Failure.  What is going to happen if I fail.  I am not going to fail right?  I wish I wasn't such a realist.  I feel as if I must have a plan incase of failure.  I just can't let myself fall.  Oh man...this is only child syndrome to the max.  I just need to get a handle on it all.  I am sure I will.  I always do right?  Well, don't use MF as an example.  I am already tired of chasing that mirage...every time I get close it is a let-down.  

I just don't want my life to be like that."

God I am ridiculous.  The thing is how dare he tell me how much he loves and needs me yet isn't supportive of my love.  He just doesn't want to be there to receive my love.  Just knowing that I do is enough for him.  Why am I so tortured by this.  I am so disturbed that I had to run out at 2 AM to buy a box of Mallomars and a cheep bottle of crappy wine (the only kind they carry in food store in nyc).  I mean I am three glasses in and I still want to forget my pain though sugar and booze.  Why is it never enough?  Why can't I just be ok?  I called this stupid boy three times and finally left a message saying, ""I guess you are out doing whatever or whomever but I just needed to talk to you....""  yadda yadda yadda.  I am just crazy or a little drunk.  Or both.  This is suck crap.  What a bad idea it was to have him here.  It didn't help it just made it more crazy.  This was my Brian free zone.  My ""I am a strong woman"" zone.  Now I am back to square one.  I think I just need to move to a different country or change my phone number.  God this sucks."

"event","So I thought that the big MF visit would only make me feel like I am doing the right thing.  Well, it did but there are also strong undertones of ""Why won't he marry me?""  I just can't come to terms with all of this.  I think that is partly why I ran so far away.  We spent most of our time switching between boyfriend and girlfriend to disjointed friends.  It was all so disquieting.  I just can't deal with this.  He tells me he loves me and can't live without me yet then he talks about how he is never going to come around yet I should not give up on him.  WHAT THE FUCK COULD HE WANT FROM ME.  Wanna top this cake off with some ice cream?...so he tells me that he is ""hanging out"" with this nice little girl who thinks that she is ""dating"" him yet he can't get over the girl he was just seeing.  So my question is...WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME?  Why do I have to be his forever pawn.  I know that I let it happen but I just don't understand why I am never going to be good enough.  Why is it that I, who would give him everything I have, is not good enough to marry.  I know I deserve SO much better and I know that I can do better but he kills me.  He just rips my heart to pieces and then steps all over it.  

So I send him home to go fuck some old friend of mine.  How can he do this to me?  How can he be so inconsiderate?  Oh wait...it is MF we are talking about here.  He has been the same for years now.  He is NEVER going to change yet he is always saying how hard he is working on it.  He is a lost little puppy and he is playing with some real emotions.  He pulls me apart. 

So here is some other things that are filling my world...

I am still trying to get on NYPD.  I find out tomorrow or the day after if I passed my oral crazy exam.  It took ten minutes where others were in there for over and hour.  This is either because they think I am really sane or really insane.  Hopefully it is more sane then anything else.  Now if everything goes smoothly I will just have to pass my agility.  Back to the gym with me then.  I NEED to tone up.  

In the man dept there is nothing new to report.  I couldn't deal with dating someone's exboyfriend so he is out of the picture.  Now I am back to being MF upset.  I will get over that soon though.  I think the only man, besides my father, who I want in my life is Weazer.  I don't know what I would do withouth that little white furball.  He is the most supportive man who is ALWAYS happy to see me and give me kisses.  

Well, that's about it.  Off to eat and go to a haunted house tonight.  That should put me in a better mood although going out in freezing rain doesn't sound so fun."

So lets get to the point of what's on my mind...MF is going to be here on Sunday.  Yes I have no clue how it happened but he is on his way.  Thinking about this makes me wonder why he would want to.  Is it just to fuck my head up?  It isn't as if he isn't busy up in some young cooter.  So...does he need to make it worse for me?  He says that he ""misses me"".  OK get it together...

"event","So should I tell you about the Will Farrow type guy or the sketch men that we met?

Well, I guess I should tell you that my roommate and I went out downstairs (it is nyc we don't have to travel far).  There we bought some drinks (actually 40 bucks worth which gave us two drinks a piece) and we went to dance.  While we were there, we met some sketchy men.  Somehow I ended up with two men's numbers in my bag.  One who promised that he would buy a designer bags for both of us.  What a nice offer.  I think I might call him and ask him what the deal was.  Who knows...worse comes to worse I get a hand-bag out of it.  I mean what is the WORST that can happen?  He hangs up on me?  Yea not a big deal.  He said he would buy us purse.  I want a handbag and a dog carrier for Weazer.  I am a bitch.

The other guy we met was cute but a player and a half.  I mean he kept feeling us both up.  I told him that I don't call boys so he would have to call me.  Don't think that it is going to happen but we will see.  Again what is the worst that can happen.  He doesn't call? Ummmmm...who cares. 

Anyway, I am a sucker and called MF.  I have NO clue what kind of message that I left on his answering machine but I know I left something.  To top this off guy called me.  I was REALLY happy to hear from him.  I think if my family liked him I would TOTALLY be with him.  I really fell for him hard.  I think I loved him...no I did love him.  I suck because of it.  

Do you really think you can love two men at once?  I really think you can.  I think I have and still part of me does."

"event","Ok I can't tell you how excited I am. Not ONLY am I going to be on the VIP list of the hottest club in nyc BUT I have a possible plan for lunch with the GREATEST guy.  Yes, I know I have a have a habit of falling for guys BUT this one is a great one.  On Sunday night we had plans to go out and I must say we WENT out.  We actually went to Atlantic City.  This is the MOST random trip I have ever went on.  

I guess you guys are wanting to know how this date went SO I guess I will have to tell.  So we were sitting having drinks up-townish and I had mentioned that I had never been to Atlantic City.  Jokingly we were talking about going and then it turned into...lets go.  So I got a AC outfit on and we drove the hour and a half to south jersey.  It was so neat.  Once we were there we ended up with this GREAT suit that ovrelooked not only the ocean BUT the boardwalk!  It was a corner room so it was the best of both worlds.  Oh did I not mention that it had a separt living room and TWO bathrooms!  I was great.  So we gambled and walked on the beach.  It was great.  To make it EVEN better he as a gentalmen the WHOLE time.  EVEN when the night was over (granted the sun was up by then) but he was totally respectful.  

So all in all it was a great time.  I don't want to jump the gun with this one because it is a sort of weird situation but I like him.  By weird situation I mean that he is a friend's exboyfriend and I hooked up with his friend (not he exgirlfriend but another guy).  It is strange but he and I have so much in common.  NOT to mention that he is shy just like me.  It just works so nicely."

"event","OK so get this...I have a crush.  This is odd for me because I don't normally crush.  Now here is the problem...the guy is an ex of a friend of mine (which isn't THAT big of a deal) but we went on a double date and I hooked up with his friend.  Now his friend turns out to be a pornographer.  So this was ALL before I realized that I had a crush.  

To explain more...porno guy went overseas to take care of some busniess and I started hangout with ""other guy"".  Now OG, or ""other guy"", and I had an AWESOME time hanging out and he is SUCH the type of guy I would like to be with.  The problem stands in the fact that he didn't make ANY sort of move on me.  Most likely because of the reasons listed above.  So porno guy came back into town today and wanted to go out to dinner.  I turned him down.  I feel ok about this but if you know me it is REALLY rare that I turn down a date.  Just simply for the fact that I find people interesting and dates are a great way to understand different types of people.  So this is the basis for my story.  

Now...how do I get OG to let go of these other things and realize that I am into him?  He called today and we made plans to hang out on Sat.  Hopefully he won't come into trouble with porno guy.  This could be a mess.  I hope not though.  I like this guy."

I couldn't help rubbing it in his face about what a shitty person he is.  I don't know how to stop doing that.  I took his number off my phone and I still find myself calling him to make him feel bad.  I need to quit that or the karma is going to turn on me.  So today is my last abuse to MF day.

"event","So I am finally almost moved.  

I got the welcome mat layed out for me as the car breaks down with my things abord.  Yes, welcome to me.  So after it was towed, we somehow got our stuff upstairs and then unpacked a few things.  Did I tell you how high a fourth floor walk-up actually is?  Well think of it like this, all the apts have 10 foot cealings and there are no apts on the ground floor.  This translates to having to climb one extra set of stairs.  This would not be too bad if the building wasn't over 100 years old and it had air-conditioning.

So the next few days went about the same...moving a few things up and unpacking. UNTIL...today.  Today we moved the stuff in the truck.  I acually just watched the truck and orgainized the inside while two members of the FDNY as well as two of my father's friends moved my stuff ALL the way up the stairs.  Now here is the catch, TODAY was the HOTTEST day on record (or at least that is what the news said).  I am gald that no one had a heartatack.  I felt terrible for my father having to do all that.  He is SUCH a trooper. 

Something that I NEED to tell you about...my neighbor.  I think that I am bound to always have strange neighbors.  This one invited, well actually her cat invited me, to tea next week.  I think this is the first invite from a cat I have ever gotten.  I am sure there will be more.  I started to feel like the cat and I would get to know each other very well after the 16th time my neighbor knocked in one day.  NO KIDDING.  I will fill you in on more later.  OK nough for now..."

Yes someone actually referred to frozen matter as ""unborn children.""  I have a big problem with someone filling people with this idea.  It is just that I look at it from a somewhat different perspective.  If I had an illness that we could potentially find the cure for it I would want them to do everything they can to find a cure.  Now I think there is a difference from dragging a baby out of a very pregnant woman and doing experiments on it and just using donated frozen things that are just going to be disposed of.  Why should they rot in a dump when we could be using them for cures?

After watching the classic St. Elmo's Fire I have realized that the great thing about such a movie is that you can find a little part of yourself in each of the characters.  So, it used to be interesting to watch the 20-somethings whine their lives away and wonder, ""what could that be like.""  I mean even look at the early ""Friends"" episodes.  They are all twenty-somethings trying to find their way though life. 

How did we get to be this old?  And where did the time go?

I have yet to figure these things out.  For example, I hung out with this really nice guy who was 29 and it didn't phase me at all.  It shouldn't phase me at all.  This whole thought confuses me.  I guess inside I sometimes feel like a child and this in-between stage is just so confusing.

But then there is this thought...

What if the pain doesn't doesn't go away?  What if I don't stop hurting?  What if I just can't move on?  I really want it to stop but then again, I am the one perpetuating the situation.  I keep egging it all on.  I think if I just blocked the number on my phone it would be better.  

Then why can't I do it?  What keeps me checking to see if he called?  He won't call now though.  I honestly think he got the leave me alone message.  I do think however that the ""leave me alone message"" was also a part of a screaming cry to not leave me alone.  It was a cry that said, ""Go away and want me more so I can reject you.""  Does that make ANY sense?  I doubt it.  It is hopeless at this point...it was the ""adult"" thing to do."

Had to steal this from mel.

Look what they said...

Stability results were moderately low which suggests you are worrying, insecure, emotional, and anxious. 

Orderliness results were low which suggests you are overly flexible, improvised, and fun seeking at the expense too often of reliability, work ethic, and long term accomplishment. 

Extraversion results were high which suggests you are overly talkative, outgoing, sociable and interacting at the expense too often of developing your own individual interests and internally based identity. 
 
trait snapshot:
craves attention, messy, open, rash, irritable, likes large parties, low self control, weird, fragile, does not like to be alone, emotionally sensitive, worrying, depressed, heart over mind, does not respect authority, dependent, not rule conscious, not good at saving money, more interested in relationships than intellectual pursuits, likes to fit in, very social, frequently second guesses self, phobic, suspicious, not careful, outgoing, vain, compassionate, aggressive, likes to make fun, hates to lose 

Not too untrue..."

I seem ok  but I feel like I am about to erupt.  It is so awlful.  I feel so gross and sad.  If I think about her I cry and break down.  Death is so strange.  I don't know if it is something that I can honestly handle.  I just need to break down and get it over with.  I think it would make me feel better."

"event","So graduated with honors from the College of Charleston this weekend.  MF came and spent time with my family to celebrate.  It was so wonderful to have him there.  I knew that we wern't together but it was like he was such a part of me.  My nosey aunt asked him if he loved me and he said, ""I love her, but I am not IN LOVE with her.""  She said that she did not believe him.  Sometimes I don't know if I believe that.  We fall in and out of love all of the time.  I think it is because we will always love each other.  I think I am just going to go with the flow of it all for now.  I just can't worry about it.  I have A LOT more important things to worry about...like getting a job.  Anyone want to help with that?"

I don't want my family to bother me yet I feel guity for not wanting them.  I hate life.  I don't want to do this anymore.  I guess this is why I am running way.

Is it because you are not around?  Is it because my world is crubling down?  People think I am so stable...I think you do to.  Do you know that I am pushing it to the edge?  Do you know that everyday i kick the pebbles off and get a little closer to falling...to jumping.  Then I stop.  I am loved...I am held...I am confused.  I am everything to everyone...but who am I to you?  I am ignored and then longed for.  You need me when the sheets are cold but reject me by the light of day.  I understand but I don't want to.  I want to hate you; fear you; hurt you.  But why?  Why can't I walk away...start a new life?  I am haunted by a memory...or is it that a piece of my heart is missing and you have that piece...did you lose it?  Was it lost in a tist with a young piece of ass?  Can it be mended?  Can it be fixed?  Can I get over this and give someone a chance?  Why am I so alone when everyone is around?  Why am I getting upset?  Why am I hurting?  Why do I care?"

"event","It is amazing the thoughts that go through my head in a couple of hours...let alone a whole day.  I go from happy to sad...from sad to angry...from angry to scared...from scared to violent.  There is no constant.  I don't always understand why I am so turbulant.  MF is gone and I just can't work out anything with him.  I can't be his friend...I can't be with him...he hates me.  He hates me because I found someone that I am crazy about.  
     When I am with Guy it is like no one else in the world exists.  It is as if time stops all together.  Just he and I.  It is beautiful...but can it be like that?  I don't know if I have ever had something like this happen to me before.  
Is it real?  
Can it be real?
     There was mention of true love.  Does true love exist or is it only a fariy tale?  Well...I know that I didn't deserve the treatment from MF.  He still doesn't even think he did anything wrong.  Like all the times I cried and felt my soul burning.  Everytime I saw another girl's number on his desk...everytime I caught the look...you know the look that guys give when they are flirting.  That look was always given to other women.  I guess in the beginning I didn't notice it as much because he was giving the look to me as well.  Once things were comfortable and love was set in place, the look stopped.  It was just cut dead and replaced with anger.  Anger on his part because he knew that he was doing something that he wasn't suppose to do, and anger from me because I knew it all along.  Guy never makes me feel like he is looking at anyone else.  I feel like I am the only girl in the room.  Even when I see a hot girl walk by his eyes are always one me...and you know...my eyes haven't wandered or doubted his intentions.
     Still there is this ache for redemtion.  I don't know if redemtion is the right word.  I think I just want to find peace.  I want it solved.  I miss MF but when I am with him I remember why we didn't mesh.  Just 15 mins in his company and he was pointing out the hot young girls around him.  I was never in his sight.  I don't know...he said it was the boobs.  I am a boob."

Which means that even though I am saying this, you are thinking...yea right they will be back together.  Not this time kids.  We split up our belongings and the baby (yes i mean Weazer).  I don't know if I am ok yet but it is for the best.  I know many of you are thinking...THANK GOD it is about time.  I agree but it doesn't mean that I will bounce back right away.  Time is what I need.  Time and Sleep."

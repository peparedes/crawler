its coming out way. its only 3 hours away

i went to the doctors today. they drew my blood. thats not good. im really hoping its not what i think it is, because ill be making a phone call to someone and they wont be too happy to hear from me.
bens mom is coming down the same time that isaac is, and she doesnt want isaac to stay at bens because she wants ""quality time"" with her son. or something like that. and if my dad says that isaac cant stay with us, its going to be really shitty and hes either gonna have to stay in a hotel, or not come down.

i didnt get to go to the red chord and converge, but derek said he didnt have that good of a time anyways and he was the only reason i was going, i mean, i wanted to go to dance my ass off, but mostly, it was because of him.
cody and i finally had it out. and now we have nothing to do with eachother. its much better this way anyways. i mean, i dont know. i wish we could have ended everything on better terms, but maybe this is just how its suppose to be.
ive been having dreams about mikey. i dont know where the fuck they're coming from. or why im getting them. the past two nights. mikey mikey mikey. its too weird. i dont know.
i miss northampton. it hit me today. real bad.
im uber excited about meg coming down, even if she doesnt think so. i am. its going to make everything so much better. although im worried ill get depressed once she goes away again. but spending a week with her, will be well worth it.
im happy over all

<P>living with cody, is so blah.<BR>i was kinda bummed abouth im moving in, but at the same time i was happy about it. <BR>because i got to go to sleep cuddling with him. but we havent done that once.<BR>because i got to have someone come home and be happy to see me. but that hasnt happen. he comes home and goes to bed basically.<BR>because i thought it would be all sweet and loving. but basically, he's been so mean to me. <BR>i dont know. he told me today that he's just been pissed about everything that's happened. not sad about it. just pissed.<BR>i kinda feel like hes taking it out on me.</P>
<P>im going to be starting Primavera. a new school. that i dont ever actually have to go to.<BR>2 classes for 6 weeks. 10 hours a week in both classes. anytime. anywhere.<BR>its more my thing.<BR>i havent gone to school since tuesday of last week, and moms totally off my ass about it.</P>
<P>i wish i had something to do though. i sleep till like noon.<BR>get up, take a piss, get something to eat, sit on the couch for awhile and then i get stoned and sit on the couch some more.<BR>its so boring. i never do anything.</P>
<P>dad said he sent out my check, but i knew i couldnt count on it. should have been here sunday, but since they dont do mail on sunday, it should have been here on monday, but it wasnt, and it wasnt here today either. i kinda expected that. but i guess i just got my hopes up.. i was expecting alittle more from him this time.</P>
<P>i could have my permit right now, but i dont. and now that i know i can get it whenever i want too, im not too.. eager, or excited about getting it, as i was when i was anticipating it.</P>
<P>im sending another poem in for another book. that used to be excited. but now its boring, and takes up time in my life, not like im doing anything else with me.</P>
<P>im thinking that my life is going to end up beign shit. and im gonna look back on this and think that i should have just gone to school. but whatever. i dont want too. and im not going too. and im getting away with it. and right now, im perfectly fine with sleeping and eating and smoking whenever i want too.</P>
<P>one of megs friends told me i was pretty over a comment today.<BR>it made me smile, and it kinda made me feel alittle better.</P>
<P>i rented <STRONG>alot like love</STRONG> and i watched it while cody was gone, because i knew he wouldnt want to watch it. it was good. i liked it alot.</P>
<P>cody isnt smoking pot anymore. and its weird. now he's all like.. DONT SMOKE POT. and its weird. i just dont understand him. we're soooo different, and im not sure whats going to happen. and i feel like i need to be going out with him, because he lievs with me. but i havent been thinking about breaking up with him, but what if i do sometime before he moves out. cody told me that if i dropped out, that he would break up with me, because he doesnt want to date a drop out, but lately, its seemed like he doesnt want to be dating me.. period. i dont know. things are weird.</P>
<P>i moved my room around today, because i got sick of cody stepping all over the bed and ontop of me to get to the closet, so i moved the bed farther from the closest so he can walk between the bed and the closet, which he couldnt do before, and he had no choice but to step on the bed. i also put his nightstand on his side, so my shit was on my nightstand, and his shit is on his. its better this way. hopefully. </P>
<P>he'll probably bitch about it. like he does everything else. i feel like i walk on eggshells in my own house.</P>"

<P>Id love to sit here and just update on everything thats happened, and all the things i feel. and all the confusion. but i feel like every word i say is being judged by someone who has no right to judge. i hate livejournal. and im pretty sure im done with it. ill keep it for the sake of being able to read everyone elses.. and people can comment if they need to talk to me and im not on.. kinda like a message i guess. but im not going to update anything.</P>
<P>i need to find somewhere where i can just say anything and everything. but i have no idea where i could do that. i dont want to keep a paper kinda journal because mom would find it. its time to search for a new undiscovered blogging site.</P>
<P>speaking of which, what the <STRONG>fuck</STRONG> is with the myspace fad. why do all these random stupid people have them. i could probably name about 20 people who dont even belong on myspace. i hate how everything becomes&nbsp;a fad. and im sick of everyone trying to be like everyone else. just fucking get over it and be yourself.</P>
<P>theres alot going on, and i want to write about it, and i want to talk about it. but i cant even talk about it to my best friends, because im so fucking.. i dont know.. im worried about what they might think of me. and i dont want to assume they are thinking the worst. so im going to bottle it up inside, and just not tell anyone. im going to go find another blogging site.</P>
<P>this is my last livejournal entry.</P>"

except.. everything is going wrong to everyone but devon and i.
its like we're invinsible when were together.. 
we live in a bubble and everything just bounces off and we dont care.

ive smoking massive amounts of bud.
devon and i bought a bong..
which will be staying here with me, when devon goes home.
i bought myself the cutest piece. its dandy.. very small. petite almost.
and devon bought herself 2. 
shes bringing home the one she hasnt smoked out of.
and i will be mailing her the other one
unless she decides to clean it out and then take it home with her. 
either way.

we've been having like.. the best time.

i feel no need to make this a cut.
or a friends only entry.

maybe because my mind isnt functioning the way i wish it was.
or maybe just because im lazy
and i couldnt care less."

<P>written on 4/27.<BR>i got it on 6/24</P>
<P>saying..<BR><BR>My dearest Kristen, <BR>I know there will come a day, where I decide I can't handle it anymore. Things are too much for me to handle right now, and they only seem to be getting worse everyday I live. My drug problem is getting out of control. My addiction to coke and heroine are greatly effecting my way of living. I find myself unable to help myself and everyone claims im unreachable. I need you here more than ever. I feel as if you're my only hope, and the only one that can help me, but you're not here. And I can't bring myself to admit to you that I've got a problem. For I only wish that you could be proud of me. If you're reading this letter, than I've failed to make my life make any sense. I want you to know that I love you. In my life, there has been only one person I could look up too. And it was you. Than you moved away and you left me here with nothing but myself and chemicals to alter everything I am. Part of me feels anger towards you. But I wont leave this world with anger in my heart for someone that means so much to me. You always said you'd be there for me... but you're not here and I need you. I feel helpless in a world so full of ugly, a world such as this. I think you're amazing. You brightened up my world and I think you're one of the most amazing, wonderful, loving people I know, and you were always the one to put yourself last, and everyone that meant something to you was more important to you than yourself. I want to apologize. I know that I've made mistakes when it comes to our friendship and I hope oh so much that you'll forgive me for the things I've done to you. And I want to apologize for leaving the world in such a distasteful manner. I know you'll go on without me, but I love you endlessly, and nothing will ever change that. And when I decide to leave this world, I'll watch over you, and I will love you even after death. You're my best friend and I only wish you could be here for me when I need you so badly.<BR>All my love<BR>and my most sincere apologys<BR>maryann.</P>
<P>mom got it today, but she didnt give it to me till about 20 minutes ago. im crying so hard i almost cant breathe.<BR>i was a bad friend.</P>"

"event","michael took me out for dinner at macayos.
some stupid bitch started myspace drama. i hate that. immaturity. ick.
i found out that cody was talking shit about me behind my back.
im out of cigarettes and my mom wont buy me another pack till sunday. because i only get a pack a week and shes being bitchy.
my head hurts.
and mikey and i were suppose to go out, but i dont know where he is right now.

so overall my day has pretty much sucked.
dinner with mikey makes up for pretty much all the bad shit that happened today

although i did something bad. and i did it pretty bad too. ick."

"event","i really need someone to talk to right now.
so badly.
i just, need someone to listen to me. and NOT pretend like they fucking understand. because they dont. they have no fucking clue and everyone wants me to fucking talk to them when something is upsetting me, and all they ever fucking do is baby me, and tell me that they fucking understand. when they dont. fuck that.
all i want, is someone to talk to. 
listen to me. let me say what i want to say.
and not tell me that they think what im doing is fucking wrong. 
just fucking listen to me.
please.
but i have no one to talk too.
and i have no one to listen to me. 
and thats all i really need right now.
my mind is going completely insane.
and i need something. someone. anything to fucking calm me down. anything to help me think.
i dont know if im angry, or if im upset. im overwhelmed with these fucking feelings and i just DONT know what to do. 
im not going to sleep tonight.
im just going to stay up all night.
no. ill sleep.
im waking up at 915 in the morning. i have reasons. and id tell them to someone. if they asked. but there is no one to talk too and there is no one to ask me.
FUCK.
why is it, that when i need someone to talk too, no one is ever around?
fuck. im so fucking.. i dont even know.
why does this always fucking happen to me.
i just wait until i cant handle it anymore and all of my thoughts just explode inside my head and im left.. alone.. with all of them. and i just dont want to be alone with them. i dont want to be alone. at all. i want someone. i need someone. and im completely alone. 
always.
always alone."

"event","this is getting way too much for me to handle.
first, i have to deal with all this bullshit with my mom trying to send me away again.
and then, mikey goes home, to his empty apartment, with a girl. they didnt do anything, i know this for a fact. but its the fact of the matter. and it just.. makes me go insane. he's fucking with my head so fucking badly that i dont even know what to do with myself.
and then, i end up at cody's house and mikey ends up coming over. and everything was going to great. and i love when we all hang out because then mikey and i go and we have our alone time and we just sit, and watch a movie. and everything is okay then.
but then, mark has to go and talk about my personal shit. about mikey and i. infront of everyone. and its none of his business. and i just blow up. completely. i yelled at him. and i feel terrible. i told him to mind his own fucking business and to stay the fuck out of mine. and that what mikey and i do and dont do, is our business and he should stay the fuck out of it and leave it alone. and let my life, and my mistakes, be my life, and my mistakes. gosh, i got so fucking mad.


i hate everything right now."

If any of my RP friends are reading this, I just want to let you know that I've been thinking about you all a lot lately. I miss you guys so much! I know we're all super busy, but I wish we could have found a way to keep in touch. I've been reading our old threads and it got me wishing we could go back to those times again. *sigh* I live in the past way too much.

Anywho, I don't know if anyone is even going to read this, but please let me know if you're lurking out there! I want to catch up. <33

I can't remember the url to Acid Pop for the life of me. I want to reminisce so bad, but I can't remember it! Grrrrr."

"event","I went to take the test for my permit this morning. One word: 

FAIL.

I'm so sad. I was doing really well at the beginning of the test and I thought for sure I would pass with flying colors. It wasn't even that hard. I have no idea how I got seven wrong. Sara's taking me back tomorrow to try again. I'm hoping now that I have an idea what what the test will be like I'll be able to pass. It would've been nice to do it in one go, though."

"event","Blefgh. I've been feeling so gross lately. I've been on this steroid for a little over a month now for my Crohn's disease and the side effects are really starting to get to me. The moonface has started to settle in and I look like a chipmunk. Seriously, my face was already pretty round, but now I look like a freak. Plus, I'm starting to get more a pouch belly. Everytime I eat I look like I'm pregnant, haha!

I'm hoping that my doctor will start to decrease my doseage at my next appointment. He was supposed to last time I went, but because I had an allergic reaction to another medication I was taking, he wanted to keep me on the steroid for longer. Grrrr. I just want to be back to normal again. I suppose I'll just have to wait it out. 

Oh, last weekend I went garage sale-ing with my dad and my sister and I found these amazing vintage cameras. I have no idea if they work or not because I don't have any film, but they're sooooo pretty. They're Argus C3's, which really aren't worth anything but pshhhh. Who cares? I'm going to try to figure out how they work...Although, I know NOTHING about film cameras.

Anywho, that's about it for now. I've missed posting on here. I hope to do it more often! <3"

"event","Moo. I need a job so badly. I just have no idea where to apply. But my bank account is slowly emptying and dyingggg. I haven't been babysitting very much lately and I no longer get an allowance, so I have absolutely no money coming in. And yet..I keep spending. Gahhhhh.

On a brighter note, I just found out that I only have two more semesters left of community college before I can get my associates degree. It's kind of weird because I'll only have had one semester of full-time classes. I'm sooo not looking forward to the fall semester. I'll be taking statistics, developmental psychology, finite math, and a computer class. I'm reallllyyy not looking forward to statistics. Developmental psych is the only one I'm semi-looking forward to. Summer should be fun, though, because I've decided to take a digital photography class. I've been kind of trying to get into photography lately, but it's sooo confusing. Aperture, shutter speeds, exposure--BLAH. Too complicated for my mind. Hopefully a class will help me to understand everything. As a plus, it counts a an arts class. Whooo!

Oh oh, and I've recently taken up sewing. I made my girls a little toy named Hildeguard. She's a purple patchwork owl who squeaks. They love her, but I'm sure she won't last long. I doubt that my sewing skills are durable enough to keep her together. I'm guessing she last two weeks at the most? Hehe. That's okay, I'll just make more. My next project is going to be a pig I think. I have some awesome pink fabric that will work awesomely."

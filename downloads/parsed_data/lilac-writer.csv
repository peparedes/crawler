"event","Today was a good day to be a Cubs fan. &nbsp;The Cubs played the Milwaukee Brewers, division rivals who are currently leading the division. &nbsp;With the win today they took 3 out of 4 from the Brewers. &nbsp;The Brewers were having trouble today because the wind was blowing out at Wrigley Field.... one of it's little quirks. &nbsp;Depending on which way the wind is blowing it can be a hitter's or a batter's ballpark. &nbsp;That's one of the things I love about Wrigley, how this wind adds to the personality of this old ballpark. &nbsp;Today it was a hitter's ballpark, and the Cubs definitely took advantage of that. &nbsp;The Brewers did too, with a homer by Ryan Braun early, and the Brewers jumped out to an early 4-0 lead. &nbsp;But the Cubs came back with a homer and six rbi's of their own, and then in the sixth there were runners on second and third and Kosuke Fukudome came up to bat. &nbsp;Fukudome has had a good year... but it was still a nerve-wracking situation because there was only one out; if he out Castro would be up and probably be walked, and then they would face Carlos Pena. &nbsp;So it was really important for Fukudome to get a solid hit, and he did.... and placed the ball in the outfield stands. &nbsp;A 3-run homer! &nbsp;Then in the top of the seventh the first two batters struck out and then Ricky Weeks got a solid hit, a single that he tried to stretch into a double. &nbsp;That was a bad idea; Fukudome threw strong and weeks was out by about ten feet. &nbsp;That was an interesting situation, especially since it was the second time in the game it had happened, with the same runner and outfielder! &nbsp;The situations were different though; the first time Weeks did it the Brewers were up by four and it behooved him to be aggressive. &nbsp;The second time it happened his team was down by four runs and the biggest hitters were coming up behind him-- it behooved him to be cautious. &nbsp;But for whatever reason he wasn't, and he was out at second to end the inning. &nbsp;As Pat Hues said when discussing the play, &quot;his head just wasn't in the game.&quot; &nbsp;That is key. &nbsp;<br />In the bottom of the inning Alfonso Soriano, who had been spending some time on the DL and was activated today, hit a two-run homer. &nbsp;I love hearing Pat Hues' voice going &quot;It's got a chaaaance.... gone!&quot; &nbsp;He gets so excited, it's beautiful to hear. &nbsp;That was the second time in two innings. &nbsp;Gotta love that. &nbsp;Like I said, hitter's ballpark. &nbsp;<br />And then the next batter, Campano, almost got a single in his at-bat which came after Soriano. &nbsp;He was hustling down the line, and to quote Pat Hues, &quot;he almost had a collision with Fielder there at first base-- and I do NOT like Campano's chances if that had happened. &nbsp;In some head-to-head matchups you don't know who will come out ahead, but in this case there isn't any doubt. &nbsp;Fielder weighs a good hundred pounds more than Campano...&quot;<div>Prince Fielder is known for his large frame, and his ability to hit homers. &nbsp;Those two things define him, so I found that quote pretty funny. &nbsp;Although it wouldn't have been funny if it had happened-- I am so glad it didn't! &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Challenge tomorrow: Yankees come to Wrigley! &nbsp;Go Cubs! &nbsp;</div>"

"event","Well folks, the Cubs blog is back. &nbsp;I apologize for the absence of posts last season. &nbsp;I was so busy with getting married and finishing up my senior year of college that I didn't really have time to follow the games in-depth as has been my habit. &nbsp;However, I am hoping to get back into the loop this season and will make an effort to keep up with this blog again. &nbsp;
Starting off, my impressions of the team so far. &nbsp;It has a very different look from last season. &nbsp;Lou Piniella, &quot;sweet Lou&quot;, has retired as manager after three-and-a-half successful seasons. &nbsp;Mike Quade is the new manager. &nbsp;Mixed feelings about this. &nbsp;Mike Quade certainly deserves the spot after filling in so successfully the latter half of last season, and also at sundry other times when needed. &nbsp;But I had been hoping Ryne&nbsp;Sandburg&nbsp;would get the position, and so had a lot of other fans. &nbsp;Sandburg&nbsp;has left the Cubs organization... probably for this reason. &nbsp;It does seem a little insulting to keep him at the minor league levels, and have him manage the Iowa Cubs, and do so well, and be so tied to the Cubs organization, only to disappoint him in this way. &nbsp;But, that is how things stand. &nbsp;
Another big change is the Cubs have lost their gold-glove first baseman Derrek Lee; he was traded to the Atlanta Braves last season. &nbsp;As you may guess, &nbsp;I am very disappointed with this decision-- as I have been by many of Jim Hendry's decisions in the last two or three years. &nbsp;There are a lot of reasons. &nbsp;He had been my favorite Cubs player for a number of reasons. &nbsp;He was a steady, dependable player who could generally give a low .300 or high .200 batting average every season. &nbsp;He worked through his slumps with poise and they usually didn't last long. &nbsp;His defense at first base was incredible. &nbsp;Balls that would have gotten by most other first basemen never got by him. &nbsp;And he was a team leader, both by precept and example. &nbsp;He was the one who would step in when there was friction between players. &nbsp;He was the one whom the other players looked up to. &nbsp;He had an even temper, he was always kind and courteous. &nbsp;Now that he's gone I feel like the Cubs don't have the same team structure as before, because of D. Lee's quiet leadership. &nbsp;
So various players are being tried out at first base with marginal success. &nbsp;Alfonso Soriano still patrols left field.... of course.... and will do so for the next few years, due to the no-trade clause in his contract. &nbsp;I am pretty happy with the pitching, and I am also very happy that Ryan Dempster has been chosen as the opening day starter over Carlos Zambrano. &nbsp;I felt he should have been chosen last year, but Piniella went with Zambrano, even though his numbers weren't as good as Dempster's the season before and it was really Dempster who held the pitching staff together while Zambrano worked on controlling his temper. &nbsp;Dempster is currently the ace of this pitching staff, and I feel he deserves the opening day start. &nbsp;So good for him!
And of course, one of the biggest changes for me, is that the Cubs beloved radio announcer, Ron Santo, died. &nbsp;He was seventy, and his death was rather sudden. &nbsp;I felt this loss keenly. &nbsp;I have listened to him on the radio with his partner Pat Hues the past few years and loved it. &nbsp;Pat Hues is good at giving the play-by-play details, but Santo was just a good, loyal Cubs fan like myself. &nbsp;He would get so excited when the Cubs would win, so frustrated when they made mistakes. &nbsp;It was so good to hear him. &nbsp;He will be deeply missed. &nbsp;

And so there are many changes heading into this season, some perhaps good, some I think not so good. &nbsp;There are several rookies who made promising starts last season-- Starlin Casrto, Tyler Colvin, and Darwin Barney among them-- and the absence of Lee gives them more of a chance to show what they can do. &nbsp;It will be interesting to see them make more starts and really develop their skills at the major league level this season. &nbsp;

However the Cubs have made 14 errors so far in 4 games, and yesterday's starting pitcher, Carlos Silva, and Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez had a little skirmish in the dugout after a miserable first inning in which Silva gave up two homers and Ramirez made an error--one of three committed in the inning. &nbsp;Ramirez has never been involved in a skirmish before in my recollection, he is another very even-keeled guy, so this surprised me very much and&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;give me a good feeling for the future. &nbsp;I think Ramirez is not happy about some of the changes... probably chief among them being the absence of D. Lee at first base. &nbsp;He and Ramirez seemed very comfortable with each other and made a really good corner platoon. &nbsp;Ramirez himself is a great first baseman and we're lucky to have him. &nbsp;
Today there was a team-meeting before the game this afternoon, perhaps that'll help iron out some issues. &nbsp;Fourteen errors is just not acceptable. &nbsp;But it is only day 5 of spring training and this &quot;new&quot; team is still getting used to each other. &nbsp;So I am not without hope that come opening day in April, things will be looking much better. &nbsp;I don't think this is a playoff team... but we should win some games, have some fun, learn some things, and hopefully do better next year. &nbsp;We'll see. &nbsp;

And after all, I might be surprised. &nbsp;That is one thing I've learned about the Cubs... no matter if you think you have them figured out, they are always surprising you. &nbsp;

Keep a good thought... and go Cubs!"

A revelation.
A light in the darkness, offering reprieve from the research and writing.
A thought that takes us far away from present circumstances.

&quot;Haagen-Dazs is on sale at Sunflower Market!&quot;

All virtuous and industrious thoughts fly from our head, as though they never existed; with lightening speed we don hats, scarves, coats and gloves.&nbsp; Flying out the door to be met by an angry gust of north wind.&nbsp; I&nbsp;always wonder why George McDonald wrote that delightful tale &quot;At the Back of the North Wind&quot;-- why the north wind?&nbsp; Every north wind I've encountered in Albuquerque has been an angry, biting, savage wind, not at all like the wind personified in that book.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would far rather personify the west wind-- that delightful wind of adventure.&nbsp; But my thoughts have only one object in them now.&nbsp; Bravely venturing out beneath the blustry sky, the wind at our backs, we race to the shelter of the car.&nbsp; My roommate passes us-- we call out to her.&nbsp; &quot;Ice cream?&quot;&nbsp; She politely declines.&nbsp; Several others pass us by, and I&nbsp;realize, as I&nbsp;open the door and hop in, and tell Havah so-- &quot;we are like a walking advertisement for the Sunflower Market!&quot;&nbsp; And then we laugh together.

Down to Girard, across to Lomas; cars everywhere; waiting for the green light; it's not too far now.&nbsp; We have forgotten the gloomy night and lashing wind.&nbsp; Dashing across the parking lot with a voluminous Bed, Bath and Beyond bag, we hurry, picking up various fruits, making our way across the store, until we reach the object of our desire-- the freezer section.&nbsp; Staring longingly at the multitude of flavors; it doesn't take me long to decide.&nbsp; Havah stands, indecisively for a time, before picking the White Raspberry Truffle.&nbsp; Putting it beside my chocolate, we wend our way to the front.&nbsp; As the items disappeared into the black recesses of the bag, I took my Synergy drink-- which had also been on sale-- and eagerly turned the lid.&nbsp; A pop, a fizzle, and liquid came pouring down the sides, eager to escape the bounds of the glass bottle that held it.&nbsp; And then the carbonated flavor, strong of raspberry, slid down my throat.&nbsp; 

We were in the car again; our mission nearly done.&nbsp; As I pulled into the right hand lane, on our way to travel the dark streets back to campus, our talk fell into old, familiar lines.&nbsp; Laughter rang freely as we waited for the light; I pulled into the bus lane, and then the parking lot.&nbsp; Lugging the bag up to my dorm, we agreed, multiple bags would be better.&nbsp; My roommate sat on the sofa as we came in, astonished by our winter gear.&nbsp; &quot;What's this, Santa Claus?&quot;&nbsp; She asked with a smile, and we laughed.&nbsp; I&nbsp;pulled off my scarf and explained, &quot;Well... you see.. um... it's like this...&quot; I coughed into my glove while I&nbsp;quickly finished, &quot;ice-cream-was-on-sale-at-Sunflower-Market.&quot; &nbsp;

I took off my jacket and dived into the bag as though indeed it were a bag carried by Jolly St. Nick.&nbsp; Haagen-Dazs chocolate ice cream was, after all, as good as Christmas."

"event","From &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot; by Harold Bell Wright:

&quot;...I never understood until the past months why the Master so often withdrew alone into the wilderness. There is not only food and medicine for one's body; there is also healing for the heart and strength for the soul in nature. One gets very close to God...in these temples of God's own building.&quot;
&quot;'Here and there among men, there are those who pause in the hurried rush to listen to the call of a life that is more real... He who sees and hears too much is cursed for a dreamer, a fanatic, or a fool, by the mad mob who, having eyes, see not, ears and hear not, and refuse to understand... Only when we can no longer strive in the battle for earthly honors or material wealth, do we turn to the unseen but more enduring things of life; and.. we strive to hear and see the things we have so long refused to consider. Pete knew a world unseen by us, and we, therefore, fancied ourselves wiser than he. The wind in the pines, the rustle of the leaves, the murmur of the brook, the growl of thunder, and the voices of the night were all understood and answered by him. The flowers, the trees, the rocks, the hills, the clouds were to him, not lifeless things, but living friends, who laughed and wept with him as he was gay or sorrowful. 'Poor Pete,' we said. Was he in truth, poorer or richer than we?'&quot;"

"event","&ldquo;To my way of thinking and working, the greatest service a piece of fiction can do any reader is to leave him with a higher ideal of life than he had when he began. If in one small degree it shows him where he can be&hellip;gentler, saner, cleaner, kindlier&hellip;it is a wonder-working book. If it opens his eyes to one beauty in nature he never saw for himself and leads him one step toward the God of the Universe, it is a beneficial book&hellip;&rdquo;

Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove.

That looks on tempests and is never shaken...&quot;

"event","&quot;She forgot...all the problems of her girlish existence. In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of 'faery lands forlorn' where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart's Desire. And she was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal.&quot;
-LM Montgomery
From the book, &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;, part of the Anne of Green Gables series.  Some of my favorite books all time."

after school: happy birthday Aaron
i went to Chelsea's house to hang out and to celebrate Aaron  Longs 17th birthday. Mitch, Colby, Lamar, Melissa, and Brittany all came over too. after everyone showed up, we all went swimming. Mitch was kind enough to wear his cheetah speedo thong, and Brittany took very nice promo pictures. after all this, we decided to have some cake. we didnt cut the cake into slice's, we just grabbed at it. for  some reason  Chelsea shoved cake all over Aarons face, then Aaron got Chelsea back, then someone got Brittany, while Mitch, Colby, Lamar, and I just watched and ate cake... the normal way... after that Aaron and I decided that we wanted to go and jump on their trampoline, so we did. as we were jumping, Aaron and I heard a rip, we looked around to find it, but we couldnt at first, then with my sharp and stunning 20/20 vision, i found the huge tare, near a few of the springs. we looked at each other and kinda walked away slowly... then it was time for goodbye. Aaron and i listened to music in my car, then i left...
 today was freaking awesome, could it get any better!?

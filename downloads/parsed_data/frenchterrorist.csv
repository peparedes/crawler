"event","well peoples' it seems like i am a bit bored at matts house. well, chowder sale was good, and alsothere was a lot of drama going on there last night. like a big thing between kristen matt and lauren because kristen got really jealous of lauren and started talking crap and then lauren was like hey, you had your chance bitch, leave him alone, and then matt was like ahhhhhhhh..... i don't like this, but i'm pretty sure that matt likes lauren and they are going to date soon, it seems like it is inevitable. and andy likes jena and jena likes andy and stuff so they were like together on the weekend and jena kept bugging me and sam was bugging me about matt and andy on how hey this and that, what about that about him or blah blah blah, so now secretly sam and jena are my best friends, it's kind of wierd but i am not to concerned. i think they just like talking to me on how jena likes andy and matt likes lauren, so they get information from me or something, it's cool, people like me for some reason. so thats basically it for youth group stuff, nat, you seem to be out of touch a little bit because you weren't there at all, but hey thats alright, it was fun i had andy to talk to and TJ came in the morning so it was all good, me and andy waere kicked out of eckerdx or however you spell it and then we like were kicked out of collosso taco for playing the arcade games. it was bad, then ummmmmmm..... i am a bit worried that you are really mad at something and kind of hoping it has nothing to do with me, so have a nice day and hope you enjoyed your trip......what else.... oh yeah, 5 page short storie due monday, but i'm not worried, maybe i'll tell the ideas of it later, and hope to see you in church tomorrow, and then like alos i was worried becasue i haven't talkied to you in about 3 days and i don't like that, i forgot that you went on a trip so i was confused somewhat on the whole why you weren't at the chowder sale? but yeah this was an interesting LJ entry, and sorry if you took anything offensively but i think i was pretty good in choosing my words........ bye

"event","well, since i said i would update this when natalie was a away, i am updating it, and it's from my house too. I almost forgot to update but i just remembered. Well, Saturday sucked mostly, i did half my chores and jaimie and everyone else wanted to go see the movie ""The Island"", but right when i was leaving my stepdad got really mad and was like, ""House comes before friends and dates"" and then my whole family got into an argument. Also i think everyone was a litle sad because they went to the movies because Jaimie was like ""this is your b-day present, i am taking you to the movies"" so that kind of sucked, today was okay, went to church all by myself, it was a lonley service, went to my dads, helped do a quick job that i was hoping to get paid for but i had to spend that on a new phone that my dad had to buy, meh... saw like 2 movies today at my dads, N.D. (Napolean) and also one that was a wierd title that i can't remember, i fell asleep half way through anyways... went driving and on my walk home some wierd guy with his cat talked to me, that was a bit un comfortable. Well, tomorrow should be fun, don't know what i am doing just yet but it should be fun. Bye...."

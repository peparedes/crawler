"event","The retreat was good.  (Before I go off on a metaphorical tangent, I got along with them and everything (we're talking the people from my church).  And we played capture the flag in this huge field.  And I got to make fun of Bruce a lot, which is always a plus.)  The whole theme was ""time-out"" and, well, I obviously kind of needed it.  It's not like I stopped anything, or feel different (a better word for me would be indifferent), it just made me slow down.  It felt like so much, and it feels weird to be home.  I don't know if it was fast or slow, it just, Was, and not many things have been that way for a while.  It's sunny now and winter is gone, I hate it, but I miss it a lot.  Everything is changing, including me, I don't know what's happening or what will happen or what to do.  Geo came over and talked to me while we were sitting outside at McDonalds today.  She had probably noticed something, or maybe I just look like the sad girl you should go over and talk to.  It feels surreal to be saying these things that I never thought I could.  I still don't think I can, but I am.  It's getting me to the point where I honestly don't really know what's real and I have no grasp of the concept of amount, only that this year is almost gone.

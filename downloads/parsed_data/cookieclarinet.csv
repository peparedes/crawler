Anyone else that i CARE about.........how the HELl are you?

it is called
YOU FUCKING DESTROYED ME

I want you to stand the fuck up
Stand up with all your pride
so teh world can see the fucking face
The fucking face that destroyed me!

You pushed me to fucking far
while everyone looks at your ugly face
I will be looking in the other direction
Cause if i look into ur Fucking face
I just might Fucking kill myself
Cause you fucking destroyed me.

Im not completely angry
cause i did sometihng to make me feel better
in fact i got you a present!

last night 
we went to the bar
told them to give us all the alcohol in the joint
We went outside and set the alcohol on fire
i let it get so big
so big that it burned
Burned my broken heart
and turned it into ashes
I picked up those ashes
put them in a jar
so here is ur fucking present!
a jar full of ashes
from my fucking broken heart
THAT U FUCKING BROKE

NOW you can always remember
how you fucking destroyed me
just remember to look at the jar of ashes
from my fucking broken heart that you broke"

"event","the truth may be coming out
the truth will set you free. 
Life has taken its tole
But life has not taken my soul
away from me.

Fragile and delecate 
handle with care
for one wrong touch
can damage it 
Forever

there is only one thing so...
pure,
true,
and clean.
that even if an angel touched it
it would shatter into a million pieces upon the floor infront of you

It has experienced pain
Love
Lust 
and deception
but yet it has remained incontact through almost everything.

My soul
controls everything 

My life expectances

My minds dreams

My ability to Love

im afraid that the angel will touch it and shatter it 
the same way u did 
when you said 
it was the end
I am moving on 
and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

that's when my soul shattered into a million pieces on the floor infront of you

i picked up those pieces and mended them back together 

but because of you 
i will always have 
a half mended soul.

and i don't think i will be able to love again."

"event","Every year in videography we have to make a documentary to make people understand the importance of a certain topic. 
This year i decided to choose a topic that i thought was something that really needed to be said. 
Stereotypes

Teenagers are always walking down the hallway and looking at other people saying oh look it's a punk or a goth or a prep. And honestly i have to say i have done it to but ever since i have thought about this topic i have really tried to stop myself and just think about people as themselves. I took a survey and i found that when it comes down to it teens classify themselves mostly into a clique called the individualists. 
Being placed into a stereotypical clique has caused a women personal harm. 
Not that long ago a women entered a local ""hang out"" place to buy some things that she needed becuase she had just moved in.
Since she had just moved to the town she didn't know that the place she had just entered had a bad reputation. 
When she entered a group of men grabed her and raped her over and over again. 
They threw her against a pool table and raped her.
The men around the pool table acted like cheerleaders. 
A witness said why should i care? he was obliviously one of the cheerleaders. 
The only reason that this young women was raped was because of the way she looked. becuase of the way she was dressed. Suposidly she was dressed as if she was a whore as if she was wanting to be raped they said it was something she desirved for looking the way she did. But does the way a person look make it right. NO. Her rapping was going to go down in history as the worst raping they have ever seen. 
But unfortunatly the women died 2 yrs later fue to a drunk driver.
A local citizen said, ""i like spectator sports, football, basketball, hockey, but that, that is jsut sick, to cheer as aonther women is being rapped.""
TO many things that shouldn't happen are happening simply becuase of the way we dress and because people place people into stereotypes. 
I can't change everything, all i can do is to strongly suggest that you stop and understand the issue at hand as i have already realized the problem and i know im going to try and stop it.

                                                              *thank you* ~shannon carson~







oh and by the way Jenna and Brian are finally going out FINALLY AFTER AN ENTIRE SEMESTER THEY DO IT THE NIGHT OF THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.!"

How can people lecture us on life... I mean how do people actually know what the true meaning of life really is expesially if they lecture me on my life...they don't have my life cause you know it is MY LIFE>

but what does make my life seperate from anyone elses? 

IF you ask me we are all the same. Friends, family, and meaning of oneself a meaning of where we want to be and where we want to go in the future. 

Exactly the same 

for everyone...i proved my point i can break a stereotype.


which is the point of my documentary. 

anyway
go watch it at the reglina on monday the 13 i hope it will rock and prove my point.

Now i know how inspirational i tend to be and smart and well may i say drop dead crazy.....(hahah you thought i was going to say beautiful)

anyway..My inspiration kind of ran out after the third to the most recent entry i put in but i can try it again.

alright here it goes


People, they can be strange things, crazy and unique
each person needs one thing that keeps them living 
each person needs one thing that keeps them intersting

people are like the stars that shine above us in the night
Each burning with an intense flame.
that yes will one day burn out.
But when eahc one goes out
they may just vanish 
but their legacy will live on

Then one day everything will explode
everything will be dead that 

that will go out with a big bang




i don't know if that was inspirational enough for you but it worked for me


alright im done now

"event","have you ever been so alone
that you felt that the only way to feel like your not is to casue pain to someone else
have you ever wanted something so bad that you just went numb
you went numb for reaching so far to get that one little thing
experiance can be the most satyisfying thing that you can ever recieve 
Experiance can cause the most amount of pain that you have ever felt
Experiance can make you alone and numb 

Have you ever trusted someone you don't know?
Once you take one step to their trust you take one step forward in your self confidence

Have you ever forgotten someone cause they did something you didn't like
but they were only doing to protect someone and that someone wound up being you
Once you forget you can never get that memory back

Have your friends ever reminded you of something you just want to forget?
They do that cause once you forget you have just lost the best things you've ever had.

Have you ever had that one special person that had spaces in their figners that were made perfectly for your fingers to fit into.
But then you lost them like..that
Lucky...i haven't hold on to that memory for as long as you can 
Cause once you lose it 
You can never have it back
And once you lose it 
You just cant bring yourself to ever move on.

Have you ever fallen and had no one to help you back up
Good, cause if you don't have anyone to help you 
You'll become a stronger human being.
Once you have ..you'll be persuaded to meet a person that will always be their to help you back up

have you ever meet a person/ or had a friend that did something unthinkable and you just let it pass?
Once you've done that you might as well hold the gun to their head
Stop them
I have experianced this many times
Stop them
I hate myself
Stop them
I stopped them
they didn't want to listen
Just

STOP THEM







i hope this hasn't freaked you out

but it was something i was thinking about


So 


STOP THEM


people in this world are stupid if you see someone...someone you don't even know hurting themselves...physically or emotionally
 simple answer

STOP THEM
save a life and 

prove to people that their is a good reason for life.

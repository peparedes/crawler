I have no ride to Bury Your Dead as of yet.

And my guy problems SUCK.
They're just getting worse.

So, hopefully maybe I'll tell the guy that I'm NOT over that I'm not over him at Bury Your Dead...or after Bury Your Dead. Did that make sence?

HMMMMMMMMMM...

Watch the guy that I'm not over read this and be like ""I wonder who that's about..""  retards...



ANYWAY...this shit is boring.
so, bye."

"event","So it has been a very long time since I have updated this thing.
I think I'm going to start updating it regularly.


But anyways, I'm at Veronica's party. Its very early in the morning. And I didn't sleep. But I'm sure that's no surprise to anyone. I never sleep.

I make no sense right now...

I need a ciggerate.

A spider is crawling down the wall. Its one of those daddy-long-legs..or whatever. I would kill it if I didn't believe in karma.

SOOOOOoooo...new FATA album August 30th..I think that's a Tuesday. Why do CDs and shit only come out on Tuesdays?! WTF?!?!?!

So anyways..We're playing board games. And you're not cuz you suck. And the cat has really big poofy cheeks. I really want one of those goldfish with the poofy cheeks. You know, the ones that look like they're falling apart? Or one of those kissy fish.

Ok I think I'm done.

No, wait. I saw Party Monster the other day.

The End."

"event","I turned my face to him. He looked so uncomfortable. But the worst thing was when he stared back at me. There was something hard and set in his eyes, and it made me realize that I wasn't anything to him anymore. Maybe he'd liked me once. Or maybe not. Maybe I'd wanted to believe it so badly that I thought it was true.

His face was cold and calm. It didn't matter what I did or said. I was nothing to him.

<I>So this is what it feels like to have your heart break</I>, I thought. I don't know why I was thinking that. Because I couldn't feel anything...

"event","When you left, it was like there was this huge gap to fill.
But instead of speading wide enough to fill it myself,
I just fell right in.
and sometimes I feel like I'm still falling.
Like I'm half asleep and I can't wake up.
I was worn out, <b>broken</b>:
You had taken almost everything.
But you had been all I had, all this time.
And when you drove away on the the last night
I was with you,
I pulled open my blinds and
pressed my hand to the glass of my window-
hoping you would see me.
And hoping it would make you stay...

<i>I miss holing your hands.
I miss the rhythm of your kiss...</i>

<b>I know that you're reading this
And I know what you're thinking.
And if you would come around,
I would say it to your face.
If you could just only see
all that you've forced upon me.
If you could only feel 
the plastic you said was real.</b>"

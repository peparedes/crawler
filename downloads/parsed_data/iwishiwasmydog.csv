That said,  I only seem to blog when I am upset, bored, or in a negative mood...  and after someone reads it, if it depresses them, there is nothing that I can do.  What is worse, all of the best parts of my life go undocumented.  I am having a wonderful time right now!  I should be writing all of this down!  

This blog is already tarnished.  I'm going to start a new one.  I'm going to put a link to it on here so that those that want to refriend me (Haha... I'm going to pretend that other people read this besides you, Genevieve!) can.  

It'll be completely new!  I noticed that every time I'm significantly different or too much time has passed to really pick up where I left off, I start a new blog.  Oh, well...  I don't think the internet will run out of space.  PS.  This new blog isn't going to be secret like this one...  maybe I should keep this one for when crappy stuff happens, like a sour and sweet blog, the new one being sweet. 

Here is the brand new one:

"event","Hhhhhh-OOOoooook...  lots to catch up on...  I originally logged on to rant about how much I hate my job and the book I'm embarrassed to be illustrating, but I might as well catch you up.

I fell in love :):)  ...again.  I hope it doesn't mess up this time, but I don't think it will because this time, I have a hostage:  Chuck.

His name is Jason.  He's my brother's best friend from the Marines and he just got out of the Marines a month ago.  He's extremely honest, verbal, opinionated, reasonable, and I can talk to him for hours every single day.  He's into outdoor sports and astrology.  He came over two weeks ago and stayed at my house.  I love him so much already <3 
When he came over we hung out in Oakland.  I meant to take him to Mount Washington, but I couldn't figure out how to get there.  I figured that I didn't need directions because I had gone there by accident a few times.  We watched Grease in the lawn of the library for free on a blanket under the stars.  That was really sweet.  We also saw Tropic Thunder.  I literally laughed the entire time!  It was SO funny!!!!  

This weekend I'm flying to Kentucky.  Jason's getting half of my ticket, then he and I are driving back together and he's going to spend the week over my house and I'll hang out with him every day after I get home from prison...  I mean work.  

This is where I can rant about work.  I'm kind of scared to rant about work, but they won't know it's me.  I am slowly starting to hate work.  Because Communications is so subjunctive, everyone thinks that they're an expert.  Everyone from the accountant to the IT guy comes to my cubicle, looks over my shoulder, and gives their two sense.  I ignore it my nodding my head and thinking ""shut the hell up"" in my head.  I'm half-worried that I might accidentally say it one of these days.  The IT guy never went to school for computers and is extremely slow when there is a problem.  He's the boss's son and so he acts like he's my boss.  He refers to me by my last name and sounds condescending in everything he says.  My actual boss, the owner, is so pushy about what she wants things to say that she might as well write them herself...  but she can barely read, so whatever.  She's very nice, but I feel like a parrot.  I'm looking for other jobs in Pittsburgh.  

All I'm going to say about the book is that Monet's ""Lilies"" is impressionist and will not look good as a line drawing no matter what.  ""Copy Monet better"" is not good advice.  Fuck you, Chris, you're not funny."

Today was my first day of my new job.  I was given a ""To Do"" list and it worried me because I thought it was all for that day...  turns out it's indefinite, general...   I can theoretically take as long as I want...  but I can't.  From 3 to 5 today I decided to not do anything and LOOK busy and decided that that behavior is what will make me hate my job.  I hate being bored.  

I got off work and Stephie called me and invited me out with her ""friend.""  It was a new boyfriend from Israel, and his friend...  neither of them spoke English very well.  They taught me how to say ""Move"" (zoot) and ""Thank You"" (tadaaa!) in Hebrew.  They told me I looked Jewish.  I really tried hard to talk to the guy who just started speaking English...  like Dora the Explorer would if she didn't know any Spanish.  We got Chinese food and watched The Dark Knight.  I didn't mind watching it again.  It's a great movie. 
Her boyfriend is really, really hot and goofy and funny.  Steph plans to learn Hebrew...  I think that it would be extremely difficult!  I heard them talking to each other and all their words kind of sound the same.  When you think about it, it's kind of perfect... he speaks English at the same grade level that she thinks!  I missed Steph.  I had not seen her in a long time.

For those of you with a bad connection, it's a video of two idiots that took a part that is supposed to reduce emissions out of the car that they were working on and setting it on fire, laughing, saying stupid comments short of, ""Take that, Environment!"" They laughed like Beavis and Butthead as they joked about fucking with the Earth.  Fuck them.

It is hard for me to believe that that's who I missed for almost five months.

I saw him a few weeks ago and it was just like Casablanca.  It was raining, I had an umbrella and turned the corner to see him standing there, smoking.  He told me what he'd been up to and I told him that I missed him.  I don't right now.  

I hate it when people ask me what I'm doing anymore, because I'm going to graduate...  that is the only absolute that I can think if at the moment.  Everything else is up in the air.  I should know by around next week if I got a job that I really, really wanted.  It's a Communications DIRECTOR at a church... it pays 35-40K and all they asked for were minimal experience and a degree!!!!  I was supposed to go watch the game with the people from the station, but the place they wanted to go was too far away, so I'm going to watch the game with Jerome instead in Sq. Hill."

He asked what I would say if he ""asked me out"" right now.
I said that I didn't want him to do it via text because it's the most unromantic way to do it.  I also said that it wasn't grade school and we didn't need to declare that we're boyfriend and girlfriend.

Here is what has been going on with me:
I am almost done with everything college-wise.  On Wednesday, I'm doing a presentation about what I had done/learned this semester, and then all I have to do is walk down an aisle with a funny hat.  

On Friday, I did three talk shows in a row as a side-kick and comic relief for a show called Golfin' Around on 660AM. I don't know anything about golf, but Randy, the host, said that was fine.  He put me in charge of promotions with the Patriot Girls.  I'm not going to say what I think of them, but I will say that I recognize Brandy C. from the first season of the Rock of Love, and some of our events are going to be sunblock wrestling and ice cream eating contests.  I feel like I sold my soul.  It had better be worth it.  It is definitely not rocket science.  I'm still looking for a normal job, because this is a baby station and it doesn't pay... yet.  

I saw the Tamborizans with Gen's mom!  It was really cool.  I especially liked the guy who plays the accordion. I met some of your family, and I missed you, Gen! 

I've been hanging out with Barto a lot, I found Kevin's trumpet, and this weekend I went to the CMU Carnival with Jerome...  Yes, Jerome who played bells in band.  He's so nice!  He's a Pisces.  We had a lot of fun, and hopefully I get to hang out with him more before he moves to California in August...  with all the cement ponds and movie stars.  There are guys everywhere and I am in no hurry to pick one."

I told her all kinds of stuff, as being with her tends to make me want to do, and we talked about all kinds of things, from the military to dating.
I went to confession and mass this Saturday...  the first of many Jesus Weekends, hopefully, because it makes me feel good and because, as Gen's mom says, ""Everything you have did not come from the world.""  
I signed up for this Catholic singles site and there must not be very many girls on it because within hours of being on it, I was already getting lots of attention.  One of the ones that poked (their version of poking) me...  I wrote him a message and I really hope that he wants to hang out because his profile sounded almost like a direct reaction to mine, even though it's most likely not.  
I gave Gen's mom two pictures and a book.  The pictures were the one I drew Gen for X-Mas, ""Hollywood Moms,"" and the other is one that I drew for [Insert the Ch-word here] that I did not want to keep, give to him or burn.  (I knew that YOU would appreciate it, Gen, because I think you like my pictures more than anyone does!!)"

"event","Josh is definitely my soul mate.  I know this because I've loved him since my freshman year in high school, when I asked him to the luau, and because he said the sweetest thing ever to me yesterday.  I used to think, ""too bad he is gay,"" but now I think of that as a blessing.  At least sex will never have an effect on us.
He said that he was running in the rain, he saw the dirt mix with the rain, which reminded him of himself and me because he is a Capricorn (an earth sign) and I am a Pisces (a water sign) and that when the sun comes and I'm gone, he's just dry and boring.  I replied that without him, I would have nowhere to land, and I'd be stuck in the clouds...  
Awww :)  That is like chicken soup for the best friend's soul.

On other fronts, boys suck.  I texted Chaz (last time I ever talk about him, I think) that I missed him and such,and he actually texted me back, saying, ""I don't know why you like me.  Ever wonder why my exes cheat on me and I have no friends?  It's 'cause I'm a selfish, manipulative prick.""  I stupidly texted him back saying why I liked him...  but I was reading this book that I started a billion years ago and just picked up again, ""The Great American Detox Diet"" and decided that he is a poisonous person and that I am hurting myself by wasting energy on him.

Kevin Adams told me that he wants to start dating me when he comes back to Pittsburgh :)  he is very hot and super fun...   probably a good match for me :)
I told Justin that Kev and I might end up together sometime soon, and he congratulated me, which was amazingly mature of him.  He and I watched Donnie Darko and dyed Easter eggs today.  We made a pig, a watermelon, the statue of liberty, Mr. Yuck, and others, but those were my favorites.  

I set a date to do my very FIRST open-mic night because without deadlines, I would never get out of my pajamas.  It's going to be on April 4th at the Skibo Cafe near CMU.  I've only told a few people yet.  I'm afraid to tell a lot of people in case I suck...  but I'm super excited about it, and I have to start somewhere, at some time."

I must have forgotten how fun he is...  because I had a blast.
I'd never been to Dave & Buster's before.  The place is like a carnival!  There were so many games...  and the fact that it was a bar as well was almost a side note.  He must have been pumping iron like crazy because when he came in to pick me up, I thought he was wearing pads under his hockey jersey.
He's cuddly, hilarious, studious and loves to watch movies.  He's super busy and lives in State College, which is the headquarters for slutty Barbie dolls, but still talks to me... 
I think that's pretty cool."

"event","There is no such thing as romantic love.  
There would be a lot less babies and marriages (and divorces) in the world if this truth were honored.  Movies should stop centering the plot of the story on ""boy meets girl"" scenarios...  the media should stop talking about who is dating who...  women's magazines should stop writing articles in which the titles start with, ""Is your man....?""  because people's lives have been centered around the opposite sex.  It's very easy to forget about all the friends/ family/ animals that care about you when you lose ONE person.  
I feel like my CHAZlessness can be compared to the Patriots losing the Super Bowl.  Everything was going great for them.  They were undefeated, they had already won a few Super Bowls.  It was a sure thing for them to win again, but when they lost, it was a worse blow than anyone else losing because there is nothing they can do to change people's minds, except win like, 4 Super Bowls in a row...  
However, unlike Chaz and I, when the Patriots lost, they didn't disband, they started training for the next season.
because like Lincoln Park said, "" tried so hard/ And got so far/ But in the end/ It doesn't even matter""  All of the stars were aligned, and then it got fucked up for some reason, so when all the stars line up again, no one is going to get excited.  
I have no idea what went wrong, and when another great opportunity comes along, I will probably ignore it, and I'm better off because it's an illusion anyway.  It's something that I've been trained to look for since Saturday morning cartoons.
My whole life could revolve around a Hollywood plot devise.  
I'm better off alone.
On an unrelated note, I got involved with this e-business...  I don't know whether to feel like a sucker or a pioneer.
It's a really good idea, and you can make a lot of money doing it, but my aunt got mad because it's hard to do...  and the douche from the company that was supposed to be helping me hung up on my aunt.  What an asshole.   
On yet another note, I GOT A CAR!!!  It's a 96' Chevy Cavalier with 70,000 miles on it for $300.  It's good, but one of the tires sits low, the back door on the driver's side doesn't work, I heard a ""pop"" and smelled gas, and the ass hole spilled pop in the center console, and didn't clean anything, but other than that, it's like butter.  It gets me from Point A to Point Aaaaaaaaaah!"

"event","Hey!
I keep forgetting to call Genevieve's mom!!!!  I really want to, but I wanted to do it on a Saturday, and I was busy all this weekend, and next Saturday is already taken.  
I went to a bar with my grandma this Saturday!!  I know that's weird.  We went to see my aunt's husband's band.
I don't like Ryan very much, but his band is really good...  and he was being nice...  he's not that bad, I guess.  I had fun!  
Justin B. has been hanging out with me and taking me out a bit.  It's fun.    We went to the aviary this Sunday.  a week or so ago, we went to Phipp's conservatory and saw the glass exhibit.  Those sound like sites for grade-school field trips, but they were really cool.  
He gave me a present.  It wasn't my birthday.  They're tarot cards.  I like them a lot.  The pictures on the cards are truly beautiful.  The faces look real, and everything around them is colorful and dreamlike.  When you come home, I can give you a tarot card reading.  I have been messing around with Justin.  We're just friends ...with benefits... and that's how I think it has to stay because he's not really my type (he's a bit stubborn) and my gram doesn't like him...  we're having tons of fun, though, and we're on the same page.  I actually think we're becoming best friends.
 
Richard called me!  I thought that was weird. He said he still loved me!  I thought that was weirder.  I remembered a time when every time the phone rang, I wished that it was him calling to tell me exactly that.  In the nicest way that I could think of, I told him that I didn't love him back.  It made me really glad.  I think about Chaz calling me up to say that every single day.  Richard doing that gave me hope that that will happen at some point...  whether I am at the point where I politely redirect the conversation or not is a different story.  I also felt bad because Richard has a girlfriend.  I'm so glad that almost no one reads my journal.

I don't want to muck up my journal by talking about Chaz too much.  I will just say that after everything he did, I finally said something overdue and mean to him about it because he needed to be taken down a few notches, in my opinion, and apparently, that is the end of the world.  He then said that he has ""nothing to say"" to me.  I think, ""I have nothing to say to you"" is one of the meanest things you can say to someone.  It also doesn't make sense, because that in itself was saying something.  Being ignored was driving me nuts.

I've been playing with my tarot cards a lot.  My favorite card is the Nine of Pentacles.  I hate trying to shuffle them because they are bigger and thicker than playing cards, and won't slide through each other.  I've already started to ruin the edges a bit while trying to shuffle them, so I have to be more careful.  I don't want to do my midterm portfolio.  

I taught my grandma how to use the internet...  it's nice because it's a baby-step to getting her back into socialization.  The bad thing is that now she reads my e-mails.  The good thing is that some of those e-mails I don't feel like reading, so she just tells me what they say.  We've been getting along really well lately.  I'm not sure if I said that before. I decided to start treating her like she's someone else's grandma.  It forces me to be nicer to her.   

I'm so tired.  I feel like a zombie."

I didn't ask for it back because if he didn't burn it, he'll probably see it sooner or later and think of me...  but that aside, Genevieve, the only person who reads this, you have probably noticed that my horoscope often corresponds with what is actually going on in my life.  
Today on astrology.com it says, 
""Dear Missy,
Here is your horoscope
for Sunday, February 3:
You're getting a big boost from an unseen supporter -- one who has more influence than you realize. If it seems that things just happen to go your way, you can thank your hidden benefactor.""

It's true when ""they"" say that ""the best way to get over one guy is to get under another"" because I feel a lot better now that I'm talking to that guy, *Kev, from State College.  He lives too far away and I would be too busy to see him if he DID live closer, but sending him dirty text-messages makes me feel so much better.  The thing that really gets me is that he has two jobs and is going to school for pre-law and is still talking to me...  in contrast to my bf who ""doesn't have AAANY time""  He also forgave me for being a bitch to him when I got together with Chaz because our relationship had always been on the sexual side, and he wanted to hang out when I was with Chaz, so I told him that we couldn't hang out, and he said, ""you have a boyfriend, but we can still be friends"" and I said something to the effect of ""we were never really friends like that""  ...  it was bitchy, I know. 
Chaz said he would hang out with me before he goes away in the beginning of the month and he didn't, and he's still not answering anything.  I will probably never trust him again.  

My baby cousin is becoming SO funny!!  She just turned three and is starting to sleep in a ""big girl bed"" ... or would sleep there, if she didn't like the couch so much.  She won't sleep in her bed, so she came over yesterday and we were talking about it, and Gram joked, ""Why don't we just put the couch in your room?""  Payton thought about it for a second, her eyes lit up, and she half-whispered, ""Yeah!""  She seriously thought it was a good idea!  Mmmmmm!  I'm going to spoil her so much when she gets a little older!  She's so cute!

I looooove where I work, still.  I was looking up some things online to get a little better at it because the company relies heavily on verbal learning, and I'm more visual.  While I was looking up info through companies with the same model/ ways of working, I found a whole bunch of negative stuff on the internet about people that have been ""victimized"" by the system and how they think that the operations are shady.  I read them and most of those people had no idea what they were talking about.  I could have written a rebuttal for each one, but that takes so long...  it would be easier if there were just less stupid people.  

I've been having lots of fun and time has been zooming faster and faster.  My weeks feel like two or three days... Do you feel like this?  It feels like the older I get, the faster and faster time seems to move.  By the time I'm 30 I'll wonder where all my time went.

I was going absolutely insane trying to understand what happened.
He said we'd get together in a year and a half and that he only dumped me because he didn't have time for me,
We hung out once this break and it was just long enough to fuck me...
but he won't return my calls or texts and I saw a picture of him with his face in another girl's chest...
I didn't do anything wrong to him... 
I loved him SO much and I was an awesome girlfriend.
I'm just going to assume that he's mentally unstable.
It pisses me off to think how much of the things he said were probably lies.
He said so many things that he couldn't have possibly meant if he would do this to me.

It actually took Shirley calling me up for it to really sink in that it doesn't matter that Chaz is leaving me.  She's much older and has kids... etc., and I could hear her fight with her boyfriend in the background of her phone call.  It's so much more to break up when you have as much as she does at stake...  
I'm still young... 
and even after a few embarrassing weeks of stalking him online and crying all day, 
I'm STILL walking away from the relationship looking five times more classy than he does.

We drank Red Death, danced around, and made a new friend (who I think is named John...  he looks like the lead singer of Zeromancer).  
Danielle jumped off of a big step and I tried to catch her, and we're officially bestest friends.  
I told her how much I loved her, and how glad I was that we are friends.
She dances like no one is around!!!  I love that!
I'm really glad that she and Andrew get along...  because I think I like him.
Danielle was talking about her how her friends were kind of like her family, like how Mark was like that cousin that you can't make out with, but you want to...  Andrew was like that new neighbor, and I'm the friend that you can do anything with, say anything in front of, and that I'll always tell you the truth.  That was such a nice complement!  It made me happy.  I'm so blessed to have the people that I have in my life.  I have so many good friends!  I have an amazingly supportive family, and good health...  so on...  it's ridiculously great!  I am so happy."

The skits were literally perfect!!  
They could not have been better.  
It was the best audience.  People were yelling things and laughing so hard, I thought there was going to be a riot (even though the building was built in the Nixon era and is ""riot-proof"").
I never thought I would be so ecstatic to hear hecklers.  It was the most excited and happy that I've been in a very long time.

ONE:  Josh, even though he was partly right, and kind of still means what he said (he said he'd explain some other time) apologized today!  It took a month, but it's better than us never apologizing at all.  There will be a slumber party with Josh at my appt. at some point this semester.  Yay!  

TWO:  I was super worried about skits.  Three people quit last minute, we didn't rehearse, most of them have never acted before, the content is some of the most risque content that the skits committee has ever seen... and we practiced each skit a few times today... and the end result is something that everyone involved is excited about!  That is a miracle.

"event","I got my wisdom teeth taken out yesterday...
I had a mouth full of gauze and a stomach full of vikes...
but today I look fine, I feel fine, and I'm even wearing my retainer.

Since I can't really go out I've been super popular... acquaintances who haven't talked to me all Summer were suddenly asking me to go out.
Danielle wanted to go out drinking, but we settled for coming over my house and watching Hot Fuzz with my gram.  Hot Fuzz is really great!!  It's scary and hilarious, and I think I might even say it was better than Shaun of the Dead.

My Great Gram called and asked me if I put my wisdom teeth under my pillow.
I thought that was cute, but made no sense.  I had those teeth TAKEN out.  That's like going up to someone who had some liposuction and asking them if they put their fat under their pillow.  Actually, it's nothing like that.  It was meant to be funny.  Everyone is my family is kind of funny.  I decided that I should try to write down as many funny thoughts that I can because I want to try my hand at stand up comedy.  So far I only have a bunch of unrelated, half-brainstormed sentences and a rap that was going to go in my new remix of Hurt So Good
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSHGT9bATdc
I want my new one to be about funny sexual fetishes.  

What is making me paranoid is that so many people are having babies!!!  omg!!!
Nicci from OC choir is preggers ( http://www.myspace.com/blueicee  to jog your memory)
and June from NK ( http://www.myspace.com/jll989 )
That is horribly scary.  I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.



Here's my rap for Hurt So Good:


Stomp your stilettos into my balls
I'll bring my weedwacker you wear those overalls
I wanna stick a two-way dildo into your ear
We can do it to Madonna right here
Don't call me queer
I would look up sex positions for the morbidly obese
We can do it on breadcrumbs while feeding angry geese
Dirty Sanchez, Golden Showers, Ima do it all
You can lock your knees and elbows, do it like a Barbie doll

(Refrain)
Hurt so good
Come on baby make it hurt so good
Sometimes love don't feel like it should
Make it 
Hurt so good

When a spanking aint enough a push says everything
Throw me down a well for seven days I wanna see that ring
Round kick me like Chuck Norris and spit on me like a camel
I wanna feel like I'm on the Lifetime Channel
Forget leather, forget latex, forget stalkings and gloves
Forget Brett Michaels... meet my Pet Rock of Love
I'll throw it at you really hard.  You like that?  Say my name!
'Cuz we all know that you like that shit!  What you want is some pain!!

I'm getting my wisdom teeth taken out this Thursday.  I was meeting with the dental surgeon that is going to remove the wisdom teeth.  He looked at my x-rays, and pointed out that I didn't have any wisdom teeth on the bottom.  He asked, ""Did you get them removed, or did they not form?""  I told him that they didn't form, and he made a joke about me being evolutionarily advanced.  
He couldn't have been more wrong.  I'm so against my genes being passed on that I want to sterilize myself.  I told my brother that I'm not dating again until I'm in my early 30s.  I think that's the way to go.  

I haven't had sex since April 20.  AAAAAAH!!!  
What's worse (and unrelated), Josh and I haven't conversed since July 4... technically July 26, but I don't know if I would count that time, because we literally didn't say anything.

Danielle and I named a drink after Mark:  it's vodka and protein shake.  We call it, ""The Mark.""
That would be so cool if Danielle, Mark and I started a band.  Danielle SERIOUSLY wants to start one.  I would sing/dance in the background and play the tambourine; Mark would play guitar; Danielle is a DJ... so I guess she would record Mark, and then play him over himself.  J/k I'm actually not sure what she does; I didn't ask. 

I failed my permit test three times this summer.  The stupidest question on the test was, ""What  is the color of the canes blind pedestrians carry?""  I answered, ""blue.""  I was wrong."

During boot camp we was worried that the whole family would forget about him.
When he heard that Vicky and Andy were both pregnant, his reply was, ""Great.  Two kids that will never know me.""  
I never thought I would miss him so much.
We used to almost never talk.  We would bond over complaining about Gram and video games we both liked.  I would watch him play video games as if they were little interactive movies, and when I missed him slay a big boss, he would save right before it so I could watch him fight it again.  I didn't mind that ""my turn"" on the game was always ""yesterday"".  I preferred to watch.  He loved Lucy so much.  Steph was kind of pissed that he didn't send her a Valentine's day present, like he did for me and Gram, but she doesn't even call him.  He reminds me so much of Pap.  Pap used to get everyone a chocolate rose every Valentines day.  He always smelled good and looked good.  When Richard saw my picture of Pap and said, ""That's HIM?  I expected someone more manly!""

I had one of the best times ever.

Amber (whom I only like a little bit), Josh's roommate, was turning 21.
It was also the Pride Day.
I was supposed to get downtown early and see the parade, and go to the (SHORT-ASS) festival, but my baby cousin came over, so I was way late.  (She wanted to come to Pride, too!  Cute!!!  Her parents would kill me... and I wouldn't really want to.)

I got there, and I had trouble finding Josh.  I walked so much!  I was stupid, and decided to wear my polka-dotted high heels...  which equaled blisters within the first couple hours of walking!  Ah!

We went out to eat at Harris Grill.  Josh and I sang Happy Birthday to Amber (no one else did, for fear of death, but Josh and I don't care, so WE did).  

Then we went back to Josh's apartment and pre-gamed a little bit.
We went to an outdoor dance on Liberty Ave. called ""Pride in the Streets""  and it was ONE OF THE BEST, BEST, BEST times ever.
The DJ was sweet.  All of my favorite 'mos were there, like Phil, Johnny, Vinny, Beth Elder and her sister (surprise).  

Tiffany was there and she sang ""I Think We're Alone Now""
I freaked out.  I really like that song.
When she sang it, they released these rainbow beach balls, and everyone was freaking out.
It was the gayest.
It kind of reminded me of Thon.  Thon is amazing.

I danced on a pedestal sans my shirt (that pedestal was the ""no-shirt pedestal,"" but I still kind of required coaxing... besides, it was really hot out).
Phil started it...  he must have been REALLY drunk.
I don't know if I mentioned that Josh and Vinny had a falling out last week, 
but they're ok now, and they were talking and dancing during the dance.
Vinny was early, so he got a VIP pass for free, 
and could get as many free drinks as he wanted.  He's just slick like that.

Josh is soooooooooooo sweet!!!
After the bus back to his apartment, he gave me a piggy-back ride;
He waited for the bus with me, and he paid for my fare  :)
Josh is crazy-awesome.  I can't believe he's gay.

"event","My horoscope is:
Ever eaten an unripe piece of fruit? Gross! Now remember that feeling before you try and make a situation happen before all the elements are in place. Bide your time and keep testing for ripeness and you'll be a happy camper.

I think that that pertains to today."

"event","I hung out with Danielle today, saw ""Knocked Up"" and had a great time.
In the movie, there was at least one big, uncontrollable laugh every five to ten minutes.  It was great, but it made me never want to have children... ever... and especially not have any one-night-stands.
Danielle is really fun.  We didn't get to hang out long today, but we're hanging out next week when Mark gets back in town. (he's in NY with his band, playing at the place called the Knitting Factory...  hahaha  sounds like a meeting place for old ladies.)

The Gun Bash is tomorrow...  I don't really wanna go, but whatever.
Andy makes me mad sometimes...  I just hope that she doesn't put the same pressure (to look a certain way) on Payton as she does on me.

I heard that 
GENEVIEVE (<----yes, you!)
was in town.  She had better call me.    :)"

"event","I went to Dominique and Abby's apartment today, Josh didn't move in yet.
I waited at a bus stop for an hour because I took the wrong one...  and I kept calling people because I was so bored.  I played ""I spy""  by myself...  I won.
Gram kept giving me shit for riding the bus...  when she gets like that, she makes me want to move so far away that she has to pay $10 every time she calls me.  

We were talking about Josh's love triangle, and 
I realized that the only reason that I want Josh to date Vinny is because I really want to date Vinny...  and he's gay...  so I think that means that I need to meet some straight boys.
I know SOOOOOOOOO many gay guys right now...  I am like, two guys away from being acquainted to the entire Pittsburgh gay scene.  

So far, in the last month... I have only talked to TEN straight men, and that's being lenient.
I think that I'm just a booty call to Kevin, so he's out...  he didn't talk to me at all since April, when we hooked up, and text messaged me last week to tell me that he was in Pittsburgh for one night.  What a douche!  A guy at the party was shooting down some stuff I said, and Josh thinks he's my nemesis...  I think that's funny.  What is funnier is that he thinks that it's a good sign that I have a nemesis, because that means that I have a counterpart somewhere.
I just told him that I need to find a straight man that is like him or Vinny.
Josh joked that Vinny acts just like me.  Josh wants to take me to a lesbian bar.  That is the last place I want to go...  seriously.
All the guys that I meet when I'm with my cousin are losers...  haha  they're losers that would rather get with my cuz.  This makes me sad."

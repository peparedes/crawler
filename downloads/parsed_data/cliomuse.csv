Do not believe everything you read on the internet. Most of the &quot;scary facts&quot; you post can be debunked with a very tiny bit of research.

I am sure many of you will be relieved to hear this but I am going to stop debunking all the wrong stuff I see. I will just hide the posts. I don&#39;t have time to educate people how to be critical thinkers.

"event","It is really hard to relate to any being that doesn&#39;t love food. Personally, I live for the tastes and textures I find in every meal. I love to cook and I love to eat.

The men in my life couldn&#39;t be more different.

Mr. Muse can&#39;t follow a recipe to save his life, has no creativity nor desire to learn the first thing about what goes on in the kitchen. He only eats to fuel himself and I am sure the subtle tastes I try to infuse in my cooking are completely lost on him. If it isn&#39;t super-strong flavoured or drowned in black pepper he doesn&#39;t even notice. I have to fish for his reaction to Every. Single. Meal. He hasn&#39;t even learned in 7 years of being with me that he needs to take a bite and give me his reaction right away or I get seriously antsy.

Babymuse acts like a prisoner of war being handed maggoty mould-covered chunks of unidentifiable substances every time I hand him something to eat. If it isn&#39;t something that he recognizes immediately like fruit he won&#39;t let it near his mouth. I have to literally force food into his mouth so he can taste it and realize it isn&#39;t poison and may actually be something he wants to ingest. This seriously interferes with my self-worth (cooking being one thing I can do right now with any skill) so I freak out at the poor thing sometimes, which doesn&#39;t help matters at all.

Also - he will eat something fine one day and I think to myself &quot;Yay! Something he will eat.&quot; And then he will never touch it again. Or he will do his new favourite thing of chewing it up and spitting it out back into the centre of his plate or on the floor or wherever.

The kid doesn&#39;t consume enough during the course of a day to keep a fly going, let alone getting enough nutrition. I am glad I am still nursing so at least he gets nutrition from me.

But there is hope on the horizon. I discovered by accident that Babymuse will eat savoury pancakes when I threw some ham and cheese in my batter one day and he stole a good portion of it from my plate. So now I am working with that and trying to find ways to make the pancakes pack more nutritional punch. Today I substituted 1/2 cup of pureed veggie soup for some of the milk (I also used his homogenized milk), subbed 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white and added 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese. And lo and behold! They are actually really tasty and he is eating it. Time to make a huge batch and freeze them up for meals.

Phew. Rant over. I feel better."

"event","Today I got to hear my baby's heartbeat. 

It was a very relieving and reassuring feeling. I tend to think in worse case scenarios so I had some irrational fears as to whether baby was ok in there.

There was a very amusing moment when the doctor was trying to put the conductive gel on my stomach and it was a bit clogged so instead of coming out the tip it forced its way out the side of the lid and i ended up with a large clump of blue (and cold) gel on me. It was really really amusing and the doctor was very apologetic.

After we got most of the gel wiped off he went at me with a doppler device. Looks like a pocket radio with a microphone attached. After much prodding and poking and discovering that there is a lot of stuff in me to pick up on doppler (I crackle and whine like a transistor radio) we finally located the swift wooosh-woosh of my baby quietly growing.

Of course then when we brought my hubby in to have a listen baby moved around and it took a long time to pick up any sign of the beat again. He did get to have a bit of a listen though. 

Of course when I got home I had another attack of fatigue and tTika joined me for a long nap."

"event","So my first batch of jelly came out quite tasty but much too sweet for my preference. It does have a lovely apple cider flavour and a pretty red gold colour and I am sure lots of people will like it. I think it may go very well as a pancake topping or on those crepes Pipkin makes for tea. Would also be excellent on scones with some clotted cream. (mmm scones)

A few things I learned in the process - 

1. None of my pots are anywhere close to big enough. I have now remedied this with a trip to Home Hardware (anyone looking for canning supplies would do well going there or Canadian Tire - cheaper jars than at Safeway too.) I now own a lovely large stockpot and canning pot with jar rack as well as a set of jar tongs (much easier to use than my cooking tongs).

2. The recipe that comes with the regular Certo package makes jelly that is way too sweet for my liking so my next batch (regular apple jelly) will be made with the Certo Light product since that will set jellies with less sugar.

3. I really need a jelly bag. Cheesecloth does the job but is really messy and annoying to work with. Of course everywhere either doesn't carry them or are sold out.

4. Canning is quite fun and a lot easier than I thought. I expect to make back the price of my initial investment within a few months. I have toast with jelly almost every morning for breakfast anyways so the amount I will save on buying jelly will no doubt add up. Plus this will help me save a bit on my Christmas shopping. 

Lovely jar of jelly anyone?"

"event","My darling MIL was kind enough to give me a large box of lovely apples from her very own tree. After freezing 3 large freezer bags worth for pies later in the winter I still have a lot of apples. So I am making several things with them.

First! Apple cider from this recipe http://www.recipezaar.com/Moms-Homemade-Apple-Cider-Non-Alchoholic-253224 I will freeze the cider in convenient cup size portions for reheating whenever I feel like. 

Second! I will reserve some of the apple cider juice to make apple cider jelly with.

Then! If the leftovers of the apple cider are at all pleasing they will become applesauce. (Though I believe they may not be that suitable. 3 hours of simmering may be too much.)

Since that doesn't even remotely finish off the box of apples I will be making some plain apple jelly as well. I may need more jars."

"event","I finally finished watching both seasons of Carnivale and some have asked for my review of the way the series ends -<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""Here be spoilers"">This was exactly the ending this series should have had. We know from the first season that Ben's mission to stop the atomic bomb (though they didn't talk about it after first season) will fail. We know the bomb was dropped and we know that no one could stop it. We can hope and dream of such a world where it never existed but we would be fooling ourselves. History goes on no matter what happens to the players.<br /><br />As for the individual conflict between Ben and Justin - They are just the next in a line of antagonists going back millennia. They are equally matched and nothing about either of them leads one to think they are the ultimate avatar of good or evil. Justin has passed his status to Sophie (whether he is resurrected or not he would likely end up a behind the scenes player like management while Sophie becomes the focal point of the power) and soon another will come along that Ben can teach. The point of this is that no matter what happens, the struggle between these two forces is unchanged. Yes Ben has stopped (or only slowed) the particular evil that Justin represents but it will be back.<br /><br />Some theories - the two sides have now received some of each other's powers. Justin took his Boon from Scutter grabbing Ben's resurrection powers and Ben took his from Justin's father - curious intermingling suggesting the two sides are more interconnected than one thinks. And when Sophie came into her power she borrowed from a power that is now accessible to both sides. Would make future conflicts play out very interesting and I am sorry that there will be no more from this series.<br /><br />This was not a feel good ending. Frankly if a series this dark and gritty had a happy ending I would have felt like the writers were being condescending. I only wish that this could have gone the full five seasons the writers originally planned for and not the crammed together second season we got which left so may stories unresolved (Lodz? Hello? He possessed Ruth and that's the last we see of him.)</lj-cut><br /><br /><lj-cut text=""And here be tigers"">Ok - no actual tigers but some exciting personal news. My darling hubby and I are expecting our first child. He or she is due on April 5th and things are going pretty well so far other than the fact that I had no idea early pregnancy was really this uncomfortable. Bleh - tired all the time, some nausea (not too bad fortunately), gas to rival any frat house and mood swings worse than PMS could ever be. It's not all bad though, I don't have to watch what I eat so closely any more (I do some though) and I have a blanket excuse for just about everything.</lj-cut>"

The most popular option I have found so far is candied ginger. Make sure you dice the ginger into really really fine little chunks - the smaller the better since biting into a big piece of ginger isn't all that pleasant. Dried cranberries cut up a bit is also a nice option. You could put almost anything in at this stage - fresh fruit (may need a bit extra flour), chopped herbs, Spices (cinnamon etc.)&nbsp;chopped meat (reduce sugar to 1 teaspoon) The key is to add wet things with the wet ingredients and dry with the dry ingredients. Experimenting with flavour is really easy in this recipe.<br /><br />On to the instructions!<br /><br />1. Preheat oven to 450C<br />2. Mix all dry ingredients<br />3. Use pastry blender, food processor or your hands to cut butter into flour mix, try and get it thoroughly blended<br />4. Beat eggs and cream together<br />5. Combine egg mix into butter and flour mix with as few strokes as possible - this is one dough you don't want to overwork.<br />6. Stir in ginger (or other addition) with a couple more strokes<br />7. Turn onto floured surface and knead no more than 10&nbsp;times, add a bit of extra flour if it is too sticky. It should be a bit sticky but not&nbsp;too wet<br />8.&nbsp;Roll to 3/4 inch and cut out 2 inch rounds (or slice into 2 inch squares)<br /><br />8.5 If desired - Beat together 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water, brush on tops of biscuits and then sprinkle with sugar<br /><br />9. Bake 7-9 minutes<br /><br />These don't last all that&nbsp;well so try not to make too many at once. <br /><br />Whip up some cream and enjoy with a pot of tea.<br /><br />(The ginger ones are especially good with Chai.)</p>"

I am not so much upset over losing my job (though I do hate job-hunting) as I am that they are throwing away thousands of dollars worth of resources that benefit the whole district and distributing them so that only a few schools will benefit.

I guess I am one of those weird people that get invested in their jobs and come to really care about and believe in the service they are providing.&nbsp;

But apparently the district doesn't.


I will start posting about my trip this weekend.

It is a very warm scent, and it evokes the feeling of sharing secrets over hot chocolate with a friend late at night. <br /><br />I call this one a pretty good and would probably wear it&nbsp;when I am feeling a bit dark and mysterious.</p></div>"

First the ones that <div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://marz.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://marz.livejournal.com/""><b>marz</b></a></div>&nbsp;so kindly sent to me.<br /><br />Kinmokusei - A nice floral type smell with some darker scent underlying, perhaps a type of wood. This is also a fairly green smelling perfume. Maybe a bit too dark for me but we shall see.<br /><br />Coeli - Flowers and only a bit sweet. I can't put a name to the floral but it smells like growing things.<br /><br />I also received a perfume sample from Black Phoenix Alchemical Laboratory called The bow and crown of conquest but I should have read the description better, there is lavender in it and I don't want to risk my allergies.<br /><br />On to today's acquisitions!<br /><br />Les nuages des joie jaunes - Lovely delicate floral scent, reminds me of spring flowers.<br /><br />ArbitRary - Citrus yumminess with lemon, something also reminds me of evergreens. Maybe my nose is confused.<br /><br />Finjan - Yum, sweet almost mapley (but not quite), hint of coffee. This one almost smells good enough to drink. Reminds me of the top notes of Immortelle l'amour.<br /><br />InCarnation - Spicey with carnations. Bit of a smell I associate with Chai.&nbsp;Carnations are my favourite flower so I am holding hope that this one works for me.<br /><br />Next up - My full review of Guilt.<br /><br />Plus! I will be offering up samples to any who want them of the scents that didn't quite work for me.<br /><br />"

"event","<p>I am about halfway through Gregory Maquire's Mirror Mirror and I am torn what to think about it.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful and the sense of mood and place is very evocative.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is a bit dry and slow in parts. The wicked stepmother is being played by Lucrezia Borgia and the focus is on her rather than ""Snow White"". THe author is putting in a lot of the history of the Borgia family&nbsp;and that makes parts of this read like a biography of her life. As well, the story starts out quite non-magical and about a third of the way through just throws in some very fantastical (and somewhat jarring) elements. The dwarves particularly are hard to wrap one's mind around. The magic and mundane don't seem to blend very well so far. <br /><br />On the whole the book is hard to put down but I am not sure I am actually <u>enjoying</u> the story. It seems to skim across the surface of events and doesn't go into the detail that I enjoy from the more typical fantasy writers.&nbsp;<br /><br />It may be something about the stilted dialogue or the focus on the historical setting but I just can't seem to connect to these people. Perhaps the last part of the book will make me care about them a bit more.</p>"

"event","The American election is way more interesting to me than&nbsp;anything that comes out of Canadian politics these days. Sure we have scandals and all that but I just can't bring myself to care. Hell I can't&nbsp;even bring myself to look at half the politicians out there. Especially Harper&nbsp;*shudder*

It just seems there are no really charismatic people in federal Canadian politics (some of the provincial ones seem to have a bit of personality) and I dread the fact that an election&nbsp;gets closer every&nbsp;day. None of the parties seem&nbsp;very distinct from&nbsp;each other and there is no one party that I can agree with on all of their stances let alone trust to actually follow through on their promises or the positions they take up when trying to get elected.

This time though I am going to do research and find out exactly what each person and party really stands for instead of just voting with the same old party as I always do."

The contrast between day and night, cool fresh notes and warm, sensual notes projects an interesting charismatic personality. </p><p>Famlies: <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=FamiliesDetails&amp;FamilyID=32"">Floral Ambery (Floriental)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=FamiliesDetails&amp;FamilyID=30"">Floral Fresh</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=FamiliesDetails&amp;FamilyID=29"">Floral Green</a> </p><p>Notes: <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=1"">Agarwood (Oud)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=6"">Ambrette (Musk) Seed </a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=104"">Attar Kewda</a> <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=85"">Grapefruit</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=89"">Green Tea</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=99"">Jasmine Sambac</a> <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=150"">Osmanthus</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=171"">Sandalwood</a>, <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=175"">Spearmint</a> <a href=""http://www.ayalamoriel.com/index.cfm?PageName=Scents&amp;View=IngredientsDetails&amp;IngredientID=184"">Tonka Bean</a>,&nbsp;<br /><br />The grapefruit and spearmint smelled quite intriguing as a top note but that faded into a smell almost like patchouli (yuck) then it changed again and I think that is when the jasmine scent started to come out, it was quite nice for a while but then the jasmine went away and left just a hint of a wood type smell.<br /><br />T didn't get a chance to smell this but a good friend sniffed it and agreed it isn't quite me.<br /><br />I will wear the rest of this sample when I am feeling mysterious and moody and want to keep T guessing. :)<br /><br />My Rating - Not bad with moments of pretty good.</p>"

"event","<p>I got my sample set in the mail today and the bottles are impossibly cute and tiny.&nbsp;<br /><br />The envelope smells like an intriguing mix of citrus and flowers with a hint of vanilla.&nbsp;Not too bad but it made one of my cats squinch her eyes up funny. :)<br /><br />I will not be doing skin tests until my hubby ges back from out of town so I can get his reaction too. I will however open each bottle and tell my initial reaction.&nbsp;<br /><br />( I will put links and website descriptions in my skin test posts. I don't want to clutter what I think I smell with what I am supposed to be smelling.)<br /><br />Charisma - Very citrusy on first sniff, some underlying florals, slightly sweet, quite fresh, almost hits my nose the way mint does with that touch of ice but without the minty smell (does that make sense?) Not too bad so far.<br /><br />Fetish - citrus again but with a hint of eucalyptus, reminds me of buckleys cough syrup (not a bad thing, I like that stuff), something else in there I can't describe but I keep picking it up to smell it again, quite intriguing actually.<br /><br />Guilt - Chocolate. Very obviously chocolate. Hint of orange. Making me hungry darn it. So far very christmas-nostalgic - smells like Terry's chocolate oranges. I would definitely put this scent in an oil burner at Christmas. Hopefully it gets more like a perfume once on my skin. Yummy scent though.<br /><br />Immortelle l'amour - Toffee, maple syrup, candy. Yum! This one is making my mouth water. I can detect a bit of something almost citrusy but not quite. Perhaps a floral I am unfamiliar with. Can't wait to try this one on.<br /><br />L'ecume des jours - Bit of apples, bit of spice, but not in an apple pie kind of way, cedar wood, and something that is trying to evoke memories of where I grew up but I can't quite place it. Maybe it is a bit of ocean smell buried in the rest of them. Might even be a touch of carnation. <br /><br />Zohar - There's that scent that reminds me of eucalyptus again. Kind of sweet and flowery. Reminds me a little bit of some of the things I smell in Gucci Rush. Makes me want to keep smelling it to figure it out.</p>"

""Yeah, you know that book you are writing? Well, I am afraid it isn't going to be a sequel to last years book. You can stick with the plot idea you have but the main character is me.""

Flabbergasted, I replied - 

""But, I have no idea how to write a guy character! And why is there a cat on your shoulder? At least tell me a bit about yourself!""

He just smiled without giving me any good idea of what he actually looked like and said - 

""You'll figure it out.""

And then he disappeared without giving me any more hints about what happens to him. I am going to have to get a better look at him next time so I can at least describe him for a&nbsp;few hundred words or so.&nbsp;"

"event","<p>Thoughts for a grey, drizzly fall morning:<br /><br />Everyone spends too much time looking ahead - &nbsp;""I can't wait until the weekend"", ""I wish 'insert season' would end"", or ""I wish I was older"". No one seems very happy in the here and now.<br /><br />Every moment of every day there is an opportunity to smile, to think, to help someone or make the world a better place. Everywhere there are moments of beauty, or power or sadness that make us happier, better or just a little wiser for having experienced them.<br /><br />Right now the leaves are starting to turn on the trees outside my office- beautiful shades of orange and red among the green, there are adorable little birds poking around on the lawn, my feet are nice and toasty and I enjoy my work. Yet I sit here thinking that I wish the day was over and I was at home.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am tired of regretting all of my time. I don't know if I can live any moment to its ""true potential"" or ever live up to my ""true potential"" but I am going to make a more concerted effort to live my life in the present.<br /><br />Everyone who reads this - tell me one thing you can see or do around you that, at the very least, makes you smile or glad you were where you are in that moment.<br /><br />Go.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","There are a bunch of odd posts on my <a href=""http://myelvesaredifferent.blogspot.com/2007/05/blog-like-its-end-of-world-bliteotw.html"">friends list</a> today. Seems like things are going to hell in a handbasket down in the states. Glad I'm Canadian. <br /><br />I just wish the phones would quit cutting out here.<br /><br />Well they are back on again now. Half an hour and I can go home!&nbsp;<br /><br />Odd that I am seeing so many police and firetrucks today. ah well, they are heading away from my house so no worries.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Retroactively cut. Zombie attack inside!"">Edit: This whole day has been weird, no phone, no traffic except for the sirens. I wonder if I will be able to get home, the buses haven't seemed to come by and there is nothing on the Transit website about delays.<br /><br />I'll post again&nbsp;when and if I get home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Should I be glad I work out in farmland if something bad is happening in the city?<br /><br />Edit - 5:28pm<br /><br />I made it home, I am not sure how or what kind of luck I had to do it but I did. I have taken a few minutes to calm down so now I think I can describe what happened without freaking out too much.<br /><br />It started getting really hairy just before I left work. I was looking out my window and I saw something really weird in the farmer's field next door. At first I thought it was birds or even a rabbit but as I watched it I realized it was actually a person, or I guess what used to be a person clawing its way out of the field. (I knew there was something sketchy about that farm)<br /><br />Luckily it wandered in another direction. I hid in the building and couldn't believe when a bus actually pulled up. The driver was looking for people who might be hiding from whatever it was that was happening.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well the people on the bus told me.<br /><br />Zombies, Freaking undead. I didn't really fully believe it until we got closer to the houses and they started trying to come after the bus.<br /><br />You wouldn't believe how well a city bus will plow down attacking zombie hordes.<br /><br />Anyways, the driver went along the main road here, dropping people off when they asked. Surreal. There were a lot of barricaded up streets and the driver would only let people off close to those. I don't even know if this guy was a bus driver, he seemed to be handling it ok anyways. The streets all around my house are completely barricaded and there are people with guns everywhere (I knew there were gang members living on this street!). I almost got shot six times making it from the main road to my house.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I am home now and there is still power but I am not sure for how long. I have all the exterior lights on and every time I hear gunshots I wonder if they will be at our door next.<br /><br />Thank goodness my husband is home. Also thank goodness he is paranoid and we have a good stock of water and food. The kitty litter may not hold out but we just bought cat food so that is all right.&nbsp;<br /><br />I just wish we had some weapons. I guess clubs made from our dining table legs will have to do.<br /><br />More updates later. I am going to try and see if I can find a radio station with local news.<br /><br />Edit - 9:17pm<br />Well the power has been flickering. I don't know how much longer I can keep updating.<br /><br />The radio hasn't been much help, this&nbsp; - whatever it is - seems pretty widespread.&nbsp;<br /><br />And it appears time may be shorter than I thought. I haven't heard any gunshots in a while and I am starting to see&nbsp;running figures out on the street. T and I have barricaded the front windows the best we can and have turned out all lights inside but it is only a matter of time before they find us in here. We have made arrangements with the landlord downstairs to escape out his door if needed, or even just hole up there so we can't be seen.<br /><br />The kittens are freaking out. I guess they can smell or sense the horrible things happening. I have them in their cage ready to go in case we need to get out of here quick. I am not leaving them to become those horrible freaks like the dog next door.&nbsp;<br /><br />The weapon situation has gotten a bit better, I found an old bow and arrow set and hubby dug a couple of swords out of storage. Our dining room table has now become weapons and barricades, same with the bed. (I feel bad for ever laughing at all of T's tools.)<br /><br />Huh, reading back on this I seem so calm and collected. I'm really not friends and relations, I really am falling to pieces here. Hubby has had to almost shake me to get me to stop from hysterical laughter a couple of times. Writing this blog is helping a bit. Keeping me sane. At the very least it is assuring me that if anyone survives, they will know I was here and may have survived the attack. Maybe it will help us get rescued? I am going to keep monitoring the net as long as I have the power to. It may be a better source of news than the tv and the radio.<br /><br />OH NO. There is a bunch of noise out in front of the house.&nbsp;I checked and it looks like the people from the barricade have been forced back and are retreating up the street towards one of the bigger houses. I wonder if there is any way I can help them?<br /><br />I guess the next post will have to come tomorrow. It is time for me to see if I learned anything from all those not-so-stupid-in-retrospect movies I like to watch.<br /><br />I've been lucky so far. I hope that I can do what's needed and forget that these things were once my friends and neighbors. Should I be glad I never made many friends in this neighbourhood? Will that make it easier to bash their heads in?<br /><br />If I don't post tomorrow, expect the worst. I will leave this post up on my screen.&nbsp;<br /><br />If someone finds this, please feed my cats.&nbsp;<br /><br />9:45 pm - Out. Good luck out there, whoever you are. Goodnight, sleep tight, don't let the zombies bite. </div><br /><br />"

"event","<p align=""left"">(Warning, this post is laden with descriptions of food. If you are at all hungry, do not read this.)</p><p align=""left"">Wow what a weekend that was.</p><p align=""left"">The trip over was fine, we saw one of T's friends on the ferry and chatted to him a bit.&nbsp;<br /><br />We found our way to the hotel fairly easily and the room was beautiful! Huge four poster bed, gauze bed curtains with gold flowers and vines embroidered on them, burgundy bedcovers and pillows, green tile in the bathroom (huge jacuzzi tub!) and around the fireplace, leather loveseat in front of the fireplace. Dark wood blinds and quite a few windows. There was a balcony too but the weather wasn't nice enough to really appreciate it. So we hung around the hotel a bit until it was time to go for dinner.</p><p align=""left"">Dinner, oh my goodness. It was so fabulous. We went to a french restaurant called Matisse. The owner was wandering around cracking jokes and the waiter was really friendly. Everything was described very lovingly (the owner is an irish catholic man who just loves food) We had Kir Royale for an aperitif, I had lobster bisque (a little salty but utterly tasty) and T had salad (probably the most boring thing on the menu), I had duck and&nbsp;T had venison. Both were tasty. they came with some ultra tasty mashed potatos and veggies that were perfect, we had some very nice chardonnay with dinner and then dessert came. I wish I had taken a picture it was so pretty. ) It was a small dish of creme brulee with a tent over it of golden caramelized sugar lace with a little cookie butterfly stuck in the side. I didn't want to break it. (but I found a picture online. I only had one butterfly and the laciness was thicker but you get the idea <a href=""http://restaurantmatisse.com/newsite/largefoodpics/cremebrule.htm"">http://restaurantmatisse.com/newsite/largefoodpics/cremebrule.htm</a>&nbsp; )&nbsp;And the Creme brulee itself! The waiter said it was the best creme brulee on the planet and I believe him. It was a very light custard, probably made with devonshire cream (everything was devonshire cream it seemed) and the crust of sugar on top was utterly perfect. So damn good! Sorry I can't rave about it enough. T had some very nice looking truffles for dessert. They had cocoa powder on them and when he popped one in his mouth he choked on the dust. Poor guy.</p><p align=""left"">We finished just in time for our ride to arrive. I looked out the door and the horse of the carriage was there. I said to the owner that our ride was here and he looked out and asked T if he couldn't afford a car. The carriage ride was lovely, we went through a bit of beacon hill park and the driver was a nice young woman from england. We spent a bit of the trip just chatting with her about the horse and the area. </p><p align=""left"">We got back to the hotel and part of the package we requested included appetizers and wine in our room. We didn't eat the oysters or the potato quiche and the wine was a bit dry for us. So we just relaxed in front of the fire and went to sleep relatively early.</p><p align=""left"">In the morning we had breakfast delivered to our door. It was so good. They made french toast out of croissants and loaded them with honey and bananas, there was bacon and fruit salad and tea and juice and a regular croissant and these chocolate cookie things. Mmm..</p><p align=""left"">Then we played with the jets in the tub for a while (I turned them on too soon and caused a bit of a splash) and get all packed up to go for 11.</p><p align=""left"">We had time to kill so we looked around in a couple of shops. I found an irish store and got a bookmark and a pin with my family name on it. (Not sure if these are the moores I am descended from but close enough) I got T a&nbsp;celtic astrology necklace. We looked around in a toy store that specializes in illusion and trick toys, that was kind of disappointing.</p><p align=""left"">Then we went to tea at the empress!&nbsp;Elegant does not even begin to describe it. The room is gorgeous, there was someone playing piano somewhere, the maitre'd got me a pillow for my back and we were on really comfy couches and chairs. The tea itself didn't have as much bergamot as I liked but they bring it in huge carafes and the sandwiches and pastries were all fabulous. They wouldn't let us pour our own tea, the lady kept coming around and doing it for us. It is amazing how quick one gets used to that.</p><p align=""left"">The only disappointing thing was that they didn't have much of a dress code. The sweatshirts and track pants on people at various tables were a bit jarring.</p><p align=""left"">After that we went to the butterfly gardens. That was really neat, there were hundreds of butterflies and thousands of flowers. There were flamingoes and ducks and a bird I thought was a kiwi. I have since looked it up and found out it was an ibis. A butterfly landed on my backside and wouldn't let go.</p><p align=""left"">T gave me the anniversary band to match my rings so I have the complete set now. He spoils me.<br /><br />The trip back was fine, we got on an earlier sailing than we planned (by about a minute).&nbsp;</p><p align=""left"">Monday we did nothing, It was very nice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=""left"">Now my system needs to recover from all the rich food. I plan on a lot of veggies and maybe some light soups this week.</p>"

It was there when I did my inventory in July, no one has requested it and no one else has even inquired about it.&nbsp;

Why is it not on my shelf! Why can't I trust schoolteachers?

Grr, I am going to request that my collection be locked up at night. Who knows what else is missing."

"event","<p>Whenever I do something screws up.<br /><br />I was supposed to pick up the kittens today. That would have given us a good long weekend for them to get used to the house and to us. Now, I can't. The kittens have been sneezing so they need to keep them for a few more days in order to see if they need medicine. The moment we decided to adopt them we undertook responsibility for them in our minds so I don't know why they can't just let us take them and take care of them.<br /><br />So now I don't need to take any time off work so I have to work a full day today. (On second thought, screw that, I am going to leave early as planned.)&nbsp;Now T will have to miss his trip next weekend. Now I will have to arrange more time off work. Now I don't know whether to go ahead with my get-together next week since it may well be the kittens first day here.&nbsp;<br /><br />I am seriously not happy about this.&nbsp;<br /><br />I really hope the kittens are ok.<br /><br /></p>"

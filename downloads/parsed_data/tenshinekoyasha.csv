"event","Sometimes things just really suck. I had a pretty bad weekend, i mean it would have been good if i hadn't been ditched for a castle. I mean is it really that hard to say ""i can't because i've got something else planned"" when someone askes to to come over?

In case you aren't understanding this let me explain. My parents are out of town for the week with my little sister. So, being the college kids that we are, my sister and i decided to throw a little get together. since we didn't want a lot of people we were picky about who was invited. It ended up being 6 people that were invited. Out of this 6, 2 showed up. these were Chet, my boyfriend, and Matt, a friend of my sister and i that is from saginaw. I called Will at like 6:30 asking if he was going to come over and he said he would. Chet came over at like 7:oopm and we sat around doing nothing untill about 10 when I called Will again asking where he was. This is the first time I heard about the castle. They (Will, Geoff, Rachel, and Armaan) were all at Armaan's building the castle for their Dungeons and Dragons game. I was told that they might stop by. This is where I would have expected them to say ""Oh, I am sorry, but we got involved with this and we aren't going to be coming over tonight"" rather than ""we might stop by"". At about 10:30 Matt finally got to our house and we decided to go rent movies. When we got back and were about half way into the first movie, Armaan and Will decide to stop in. They came inside for about 3 mins and then left to go get somethings to use to build the castle, and never returned. 

And to sum up how I felt about all of that I will share my feelings and thoughts on the matter. I was insulted and hurt by these actions. I felt (and still do feel) that my friends would rather spend their free time building a castle than spending the time with me. I took this as an insult because it was like they were saying that I wasn't worth their time, and that the castle was more important than me. 

That is all I have to say on that matter for now. If you want to contest what I said feel free because I am allowing all comments on this entry. and pretty much everyone, only they are screened."

I don't think it is a big deal it's just that I don't like it when no one is around here, expecialy Chet. He is just wonderful, and that reason is another story for another day. 

Today was pretty good, for a school day. Crappy as a Friday. It's yet another friday where I sit alone in my basement. It's not Chet's fault that I am here, because he has other things going on on Friday nights. If I had thought of this earlier, I might have called someone, but it is to late now. I am bored now too. I think I might go watch Nightmatre Before Christmas again, but i am not sure. I just want this ass f-ing cold weather to go away. It is supposed to warm up tomorrow, but i highlydoubt that it will make the snow go away. I wonder what Armaan is up to tonight... I might go call him. If I can't think of anything else to do. 

Maybe I'll play some FF-X2. I haven't played in a while. AND I'll not use the book. It's kinda late and Armaan wouldn't be allowed over now anyway. So I guess I'll go and play some video games.

But other than that school looks pretty good, i think my math class will be okay, even with a 50% passing ratio. I have to go return my soc. book to buy a more expensive one. Armaan has decided that counterstrike is a lot more important than me. the only peron to really ever call me is chet, not that i mind it because i love talking to him, but still it is depressing to theink that the only one who wants to talk to me is the one person i am dating. it's like no one else likes me. and then you have to people in the basement that act like they hate me. it's just not fair. everyone else is going out and hanging out with people and i am not. I always am at home alone when i am not with chet, but i mean he goes out with his freinds and that is good, i mean i don't want him to lose his friends like i have lost mine... well enough depressing thoughts for now, i think...

That is all true for my life right now. I mean it seems that i can't do anything right at times. I come home from school and i get told what to do by karen and then i tell my mom what happened at my meeting, and she tells me she doesn't care when she is the one that told me to go to the meeting in the first place. Then my my dad comes home and yells at me. 

Not to mention i got yelled at for being at school all day, and not doing work. This is a normal action so what do i do? I go and clean my room. When i am done i ask my mom if i can go to Butterfly tonight, and she says no. So i ask her if i can go if i get my work done and she says that it'll never happen so i just go eat dinner. After dinner,  Armaan calles and i say he can come over cause i still wanted to go to butterfly, but i knew i had to clean the basement before i could go. so i was going to clean the basement while he was here. Well my dad decided again that it would be good to yell at me and this all ended up with me getting a 5 inch long scrach on my shoulder blade. so anyway i am here and i am going to go lock myself in my room yet again and hide there till chet calls me back. good night

"event","I know that i may seem weird to some but i have a wonderfull time just watching movies in my basement with Chet. I also think that tonight is one of the best nights i've had in a while. The only reason i am saying that tonight was better than most other nights (most of them spent with chet) is that i got to sit and watch a movie in my basement with both my boyfriend and my best friend. It was really great. I haven't seen Armaan in such a long time so it was great that he and Chet came over. It was great, but i hope it wasn't weird to much for Armaan, cause Chet and  i we are cuddly and what not...I just hope he didn't feel out of place. 

Reguardless, i went out for chinese food with Chet tonight and it was good. After wards i took Chet out for ice cream, and i still owe him a doller, but it was good stuff! and we went to go get sarah and i got to see colin and mike so that was all good. Well that's all for now,

I mean it's great when you can have a great time just sitting on the couch playing mario sunshine, but when the person you are with has to go home because your parents make him, why is it then that you don't want him to go and feel so alone afterwards?

   -Everyone else- I am sorry you didn't get mentioned by name, but there are so many of you that this entry would be like 10 pages long if i mentioned everyone. 

*my boyfriend- Yeah, you get mentioned on your own. you put up with me and my crazy antics, well the ones you have seen. and you make my ""down time"" at school a lot more enjoiable. :) 

*My puppy <G>

*My Computer (Even tho it is like dead now)

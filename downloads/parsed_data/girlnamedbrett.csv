"event","Sooooo let's see.. Since my last update, I've been going to gym like for a billion hours a day.  Adee has been gone for FAR TOO LONG! AHHHHH I miss the girl! hehe but she comes back soon so YAY. and I'm going to get her a pretty bday/grad present! =)

I kinda want the year to start because I'm anxious to leave for college. haha I talked to the Gymnastics coach from Cornell today. She called me and I was like OMG! I'm excited cause she sounds sorta interested and really nice. Anyway, I'm not getting my hopes up just yet or anything I'm just excited to start and finish this process. haha.

It almost feels like summer is over. I don't probably when Adee (and shelly for like a week) get back and the people who are still here get together, it'll be more like summer. I've spent the last like 10 nights with Kerri, since her parents have been in Europe. We had a lot of fun. =) Anyways, I am pretty bored and I just thought that I would post on lj since it's been like forever since. Mm Hmm 

My Amandita is away in Orroville... having fun in the sun. God damn her! not really because i miss her!!! haha I can't wait to go to Hawaii though, that is going to be SO FUN! AH! haha her big sis is turning 21 so partay.. I get to fly to Maui with her and i'm deathly afraid of flying. maybe she'll hook me up. hahah doubtful. hehe whatever. Anyway, that's that so peace out. byebye

But hey, im going to use it bitch. Well Yeah . I'm sad. I loved this winter break. It felt WAY long but WAY short at the same time. Just... how is that possible. Many memories made. Thanks guys I love you all. And i miss you mother fuckers who left already. Pej. You left Sunday. Come back in May for me please. K thanks =(. Pat you left tonight and it was sad saying goodbye yet AGAIN. sigh. Shelly tho, well shell came back tonigh and she stopped by for a minute and said hello. I will see her tomorrow. You can't go back i won't let you. Im SO not ready to start the whole school schedule thing again. Gr. Like not at ALL! And next new years I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING! GRRRR but thats okay, its kinda really amusing watching drunk people. But when there are like thousands of bottles of alcohol within ur reach, really good junk food, you kinda forget how amusing it is and just want to cry. Then its like you get a call from another friend who isn't there with u and he's totally hammered too.. just fuck man. Happy 2005. And I don't have a resolution. Actually, I have a goal that I want achieved. Actually I have like 5. Maybe Ill tell you one day. Yesh. Yes. M-oh yes. Blah now I'm just saying nothing. But yeah. Next year at this time its going to be like 2359948579348793487 times worse. Cause I have my girlfriends who won't be here. because yeah. PLUS the ones who are already gone THIS year. FUCK. UGH. Just yeah. Id like to jump ahead 2 years from this very moment...sorta.. sorta not really tho. That's cool. So Im going to go now. This is one of the most journal-ish types of entries I've done in a while. And if you don't like any of it, well...well you can fuck off because this is my journal and yeah dude. YEA haha. Wow. I guess its time for me to go back to reading the bible. Man, i wish i went to church this Christmas. I do feel bad Jesus, I promis! haha look at me go. I love you all. And I hope all who drank themselves silly last night have recovered and no evidence of any of it was found. haha 

Peace the fuck out.

LA LA LA! =) BUT i still have to go and take my cousin and her darlin lil 8th grader friends to school.. so technically i have to wake up at like 6:30 anyways. but shit man its better than having to go and STAY there. hmm yeahhh pretty fast week. yeah actually really fast week. yay woaahh. dude christmas is in exactly........ 62 days... that would be 1488 hours eeee.. which means my birthdat is in about 54 days. im pretty sure. 17. hmm yes. cool dude. Very cool! getting quite sick of my user picture. but its okay. i dont really care. haha. hoping for a fun weekend.. dono. lol we'll see. next weekend im home alone. parrtty.. haha yeah right. i would never do that. im not that stupid. tee hee. 
and for all you who make abortion the number one deciding factor in the presidential eletion. I would have to say you need to do a hell of a lot more research and see what bush is NOT against.. oh yeah killing innocent people in Iraq. yes sending troops there.. by the way these people ARE born and have esablished families.. but oh no... god forbid hes prolife.. MY ASS.. whatever im not saying abortion is right. because i think its totally relative to the situation. kay. but ya know. if you really dont like it, you really need not surround yourself with people who would get abortions anyways. like really. and gay marriages too. mmkay so like the people down the street.. if they are gay. does that REALLY affect YOUR PERSONAL LIFE???? yes maybe you dont agree and it doesnt corresond with your values.. but hey they obviously have an entirely different set of values. so yeah. let peole be happy. but i think sending people to Iraq and having loved ones killed in a war that we are almost positively not going to win might definitely affect your personal lives. but oh my god. two men in the same house who love each other. shiiiit. and this is stricly my opinion. not trying to start debates or anything. but im just saying i mean damn. people who call kerry and edwards ""baby killers"".... i have no respect. i mean seriously fuck off. and this is my lj so if u have a problem with anything im saying. haha i dont even give the slightest shit. 
i got IN N OUT today with megababe. it was good. and i totally stared at these guys cause he made a weid noise.. and i totally felt retarded because he was staring right back at me. haha awkward....."

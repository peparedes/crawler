"event","This has turned out to be a really bad day. I was talking with some of my friends and they were talking about their plans for prom and I want to go but if i go i would have to pay for everything. So I asked my mom a couple of weeks ago to find my social security card so i can go get a job and she hasn't been looking for it and then Eddie not helping with any of the plans. so i'm starting to think maybe i just shouldn't go. i mean i can't plan this by myself and no one else wants to help me plan it. so i guess no prom for me. =("

"event","Eddie has really screwed up this time. He had been drinking tonight and he wanted to go somewhere i guess. but my mom wouldn't let him go b/c he didn't need to go anywhere since he had been drinking so he made it look like he was coming downstairs and he snuck out the window and took my mom's car and what made it worse he got stop by the cops and now i'm waiting for him to get back"

"event","since i think either thursday or friday i've had a cold and it has only gotten worse over the weekend. well its a little better now other than the fact when i cough it sounds like and organ is trying to come out. i didn't go to school today and i have to go see the doctor wed. i should be in school tomorrow but i know i won't be able to play in gym b/c if i start coughing like i've been doing while out of breathe it probably won't be pretty. jessiy thinks i have a mixture of her cold and strep. fun. *rolls eyes*

Other than that eddie isn't feeling good either. my poor baby. he had applied for this job and this guy keeps jerking him around which is making him frustrated. there is a lot of shit going on right now for him. and he hasn't had the easiest time in the past. i really hope things get better for him soon. i love him so much and i don't like seeing the ones i love sad. i really wish there was something i could do for him. but i've done probably about as much as i can. all i can really do for him now is to stay with him and help him get through this the best i can.

My mom came back from Iowa on thursday and i'm glad for that i missed her a lot while she was gone. everything is still hectic here. but what else is new for this family. Karen's pissed at one of her boyfriend's, Colin, b/c he hasn't called her. she is probably pissed b/c he is doing to her what she was doing to him. but oh well. maybe one day she'll learn that she can't keep treating guys the way she does. she'll sit there and tell a guy that she loves him and cares for him and go and tell another the same thing. she has two kids one is 5 and one is 2 and instead of staying here and taking care of her kids most of the time she is off with one of her boyfriends. she shouldn't have kids if she doesn't want to be the one taking care of them. i better get offline before fred gets up and starts flipping. around this time is part of his ""quiet time."""

"event","I can't wait to move out of this house. My stepdad is an asshole. He gets mad at everyone else in this house so he bitches at me. I can't wait til mom gets home. I've never liked him and now he is just making me dislike him even more. I'm sure if it was up to him I would be out of this house as soon as possible. He pisses me off so much.

On a better note I get to get out of this house tonight so me and Eddie can do something for Valentines Day. I'm sure me and him will have fun. I'll probably write about that later tonight. Well I pretty much just had to vent."

"event","Turns out Eddie decided to go see his mom at work. And he was going to call, he knows he should've call but he didn't. I don't know what to think anymore. I feel like maybe he doesn't want to be with me anymore so he is trying to upset me so that i'll break up with him but thats probably just me being paranoid. Eddie is the longest relationship I've been in. It will be 5 months Feb. 11. I know that might not seem like a long time but I love him so much and I don't want to lose him especially over some stupid little thing like this but he keeps doing it over and over again. He'll tell me he is going to call or be here at a certian time and he either doesn't call or he doesn't come home when he says he will. I don't know what to do. I don't want him to keep doing this to me and he knows it gets me upset but I don't want to lose him either. Any advice is welcome just post a comment."

"event","I hate it when Eddie does this. He tells me he'll call before he leaves work and doesn't and he says he'll be home after work and he doesn't. I called his work to see if he was still there and they said he left around 10:15-10:30 and its now 11:40. So I don't know where he is and it worries me. rewjes and jessy should know why. And when he gets home I'll say something about and he'll tell me where he was and I'll ask why didn't he call and he'll say I don't know and that he is sorry and being the person that I am I'll say its alright. He always says he sorry for doing but if he is really sorry then why does he do it? He just confuses me sometimes. I really wish he would do what he says he is going to do."

"event","Turns out Eddie only had to go to his job for like 5 minutes to talk to the guy there. Then he went over to his friend Aaron's house. I'm kinda pissed though but not alot. I bought Eddie this Dragon Ball Z lighter for our anniversary and he says that he let Aaron use and Aaron didn't give it back but now Aaron's saying he gave it back so now the lighter has just seem to disappear. And it seems like Eddie doesn't care that he lost it but I know he probably does just isn't showing it. Well I'm going to go to sleep now. nightnight"

"event","Today was better than yesterday. Eddie started his new job today. I'm not sure when he will be home but oh well. I was alone in my 9th hour gym class because rewjes wasn't there. I've started telling people that I have a live journal. I'm so tired. Well I'm going to go get some sleep. I'll probably write more after Eddie gets home."

"event","hey my name is Annie. Most people at my school know me as Charlie only my family and my boyfriend call me Annie. I live with my Mom, my step dad - Fred, my cousin- Karen, her two kids- Victoria and William, and my boyfriend- Eddie. 

Today was a really crappy day. It started out good but then just went bad. First I forgot my birth control at home so I called Eddie up to bring it to me and then I guess he talked to the security guard at school and the security guard brought Eddie to the nurse and she told him I couldn't take them during school. Then I saw Eddie driving pass the entrance doors so I went out there to get him and I got my pills but the security guard saw me and took me to the nurse and then she told me I couldn't take them in school so I should change what time I take them and wait another month before having sex and she did actually say that. Pretty much I kept saying that i had to take them then and then she sent me to the dean and he pretty much told i couldn't take the pills in school and all this other stuff and I could pick my pills up at the end of the day. And that really pissed me off. So at the end of the day I went and got my pills and then Eddie was suppose to pick me up and he wasn't there he was at home sleeping and my cousin wouldn't come pick me up so me and rewjes had to walk home. When I got home I tried to wake Eddie up and he wouldn't wake up so my friend Natalie came over and we talked and I was in a pissed off mood  so I guess I said something about Eddie and later on he told me that he heard what I said and pretty much he was mad at me. But then me and him talked about it and now everything is ok between me and him. And now I'm watching my cousin's kids Victoria is 5 and William is 2. William is in bed and Victoria is being a pain but what else is new. Well thats all I have to write about right now."

"event","Alright... So it is summer! I want summer to be over right now because I want to go to college so bad!!! I am completely pumped to be an MT at BW. I've heard that my MT class is supposed to be 'fierce' and I can't wait! OH and I got an email saying that B-W was one of 2 colleges given the rights to Phantom of the Opera!! So we are doing that in the fall... It's like a trial to see if they want to open up the rights to everyone, so the producers or something will come see ours!
One of the girls put this together (you've probably seen it on fb).

<img src=""http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y229/mykylestyle/bwmt.jpg"">

I leave on Thursday to go to Orientation and there will be 5 of us there. Can't wait to meet them. I hope I like them and vice versa (Sp).

Tonight I work at 5. I think I've decided that I am going to stop working at Bruster's and tell them that I want a break before I go to college. I worked on Saturday and I was completely miserable - I liked who I was working with, but I just didnt want/need to be there. I think 3 years of it is enough and I think i'm too old for it lol. I'm ready for college.

NEWSFLASH I found a song to sing (Sainty, the top-left girl in the pic, suggested it). I love it and I kind of have to belt my ass of at one point, which sounds good 85% of the time. I'm a little nervous but completely pumped and ready to perform it. It was cut from the musical ""A New Brain"" so no one has heard it :) :) :) :) I still need a monologue--I might just use one of my college ones.

ANYWAY

"event","for all who have had ms weitekamper: I organize my post based on her criteria.

Topic: I can't wait until I am done with high school.
Position: I want to be done now and I feel that all of these days up until graduation are unnecessary.
Reason 1: I am accepted into college.
Reason 2: I got into NYU (hahaha).
Reason 3: high school should be done now. :(
Specific Examples 1: I am tired. If it were summer I would ahve time to sleep!

ok thats enough of that


anyway, the past few days have been sluggish and bodily miserable. I am basically done with everything for school (AP Finals, good grades, etc etc) so I have nor eason to go to school. So i just sit there and wait for the bell to ring. All 4 blocks. And, for the past 4 days, my left ear has been blocked. This is horrible and i hope it happens to no one! Today, I actually had a lot of trouble hearing stuff. and it will randomly decide to be in pain throughout the day. When I got home, i laid on the coach and Dr. Mom put ear drops in and this stuff that gets wax out. I used to get tons of ear infections as a kid - apparently they were almost going to put tubes in my ears (news to me!)... anyway i was stuck on that coach until 430 when i had a slice of pizza and headed off to Bruster's for the night. Basically the only girl that I genuinely like to work with there, is quitting in 2 weeks. work was alright though - but to the one guy who insisted that he was NOT served chocolate chip cookie dough, it WAS fucking chocolate chip cookie dough.

anyway, to top off my miserable-ness, my sprained ankle is a good actor. it is fine to walk on (most of the time) without any trouble at all actually. But stairs take a while and I can't play volleyball 100% yet - i have a tournamnet in virginia next weekend! ahh lol. it is still swollen, i hope its getting better.



sorry for being negative. life's not all that bad right now actually - i just want school to be done! highlights of my week included completing 2 AP tests, looking at the yearbooks (that were awesome), realizing that I might have done a good job on my psych test @ moes with hillary, Weds night dinner and Fiddler w/ Lili & Casey, and my tennis ball fight (with 30 tennis balls hahahaha) w/ shante and erica inside the concession stand.

gotta wake up in a bit to go to applebee's to serve pancakes... lol?"

Bad news: I didn't get into Elon for Musical Theatre. ..

Good news: I got a letter in the mail saying I got the ""Heritage Scholarship"" which is $4,500/yr!!!! I am quite ecstatic about this,.. but you know, it would be nice to have a place to use this at (cough, NYU or Baldwin-Wallace).



So now I have Baldwin-Wallace, NYU, and Syracuse left to hear final decisions from. Syracuse doesn't really matter because I don't want to go there (I probably won't get in anyway). I have a good feeling about NYU, and Baldwin-Wallace is my #1, so i really want to get in there!


so i worked at bruster's this afternoon and it was nice, after the first hour, i was all by myself and it was beautiful and easy. $10/hr and $17 in tips. wooooooooooooooo. and i also sang for mercer this morning (and I did horribly lol) but i'm just rollin in the money this weekend. lol.

"event","Dear lj- where have you been?

Sorry i havent updated in a few millenia.

Life is crazy lately. Senior year = I can't wait until it is done! AP Psychology and Kyle Szen do not get along. I seem to understand the material (sometimes) and it is interesting, but I just am not a fan of the Weitekamper class routine. We do soooo much (yesterday was the 1st day all semester when I actually breathed because we just sat and chilled) and never have a second to waste. But umm I just got a 93 on a test which I am crazy happy about.

Today we had a bake sale for yearbook and one of the lunch ladies came out and was really uncalled for and immature and made us leave becasue we were taking all of their business. I was pissed. But we made $140 just from A lunch & from walking aorund!

COLLEGE. I am going insane. Normal College admissions is basically stressful by itself. Since I am going (trying to) for Musical Theatre, it is even harder - and I don't think anyone realizes it. Everyone thinks Im crazy fro applying at 7 schools, but little do they know it is so hard to get into for musical theatre. I've auditioned at 6 schools and here's the breakdown:

In order of my liking- #1=best:
1. Baldwin-Wallace: 200 audition for 12 spots
2. Elon: I think around 300 audition for 16 spots??
5. Penn State: 300+ audition for 14 spots
4. NYU: 1200 audition for 60 spots
5. Lees-McRae: Basically if you audition and you can breathe you get in.
6. Syracuse: 350-400 audition for 30 spots

OK so now you have somewhat of an idea - but everyone I tell is like ""who cares kyle, you are amazing you'll get into them"" i'm like ARE YOU CRAZY! That is so hard. I'd like to think I'm talented but so are the other people auditioning! I actually wish that I had auditioned at MORE schools - I am flipping out because I'm so nervous. Even if I am good, I may just not be what one school is looking for. Anyway...


-of course I got accepted to Lees-McRae, with a generous scholarship offer and everything - but the kids in their program are not nearly as talented as the others... and its such a small school, most of the people are kinda weird.
-I got a rejection from Penn State already. I was accepted for Education, but not for Musical Theatre (they sent 2 different rejection letters FYI - thanks PSU).
-For my #1 school, Baldwin-Wallace (in Ohio), I am on the waiting list. So Now I just wait and hope that one of the 6 guys that was accepted decides not to attend. PLEEEEASEEEEEEE! This would be perrrrrfect! :)
-That's all I've heard so far. I've heard rumors that Elon sent out phone calls to the accepted musical theatre kids... Yeah I didn't get one - Sucks for me. 

Still have to hear from SYRACUSE and NYU (the 2 ""most prestigious"" schools on my list). So it's not looking too promising for me.

So basically I am feeling pretty sucky and like a failure. I really wish I had auditioned at more schoolsssssssss ... I just want to know where I will be accepted - I wanted to be accepted to a bunch of places just to feel confident and to have OPTIONS. I don't want to go somewhere by default...

I could always become an accountant or architecht. But my dream is to be a performer (even though they make jack-shit for money). WTF!

Alright. That's my ranting.

Wish me luck that I get in to other places, and best of luck to everyone else in the search... I guess we'll all end up in the right place!

The first episode of Season 3 of LOST was yet again confusing (of course) and I kept like yelling questions at the screen (in my head) because it is so confusing... but INTERESTING since I'm ""attached"" to the other characters.

Then I watched ""The NINE"" and HOLY CRAP it was good!!! It got so intense within like 10 minutes and the whoel thing was sad. BUT wow something they showed at the very end was like ""WHOA"" .. anyway.. it was good.


This weekend (on Friday) I leave to visit my brother at USC (for a quick hour or 2) on my way to a college visit to Lees-McRae (small school in NC). On Saturday I have a scheduled audition for enrollment in the musical theatre program (aka ""performing arts studies"" is what their degree is called) and after that I try out for their Division 2 Volleyball team. So i have a pretty exciting/nervewracking weekend planned.

No bookbag for me, BUT i did however wander into the men's section (where they had TONS of awesome american eagle stuff) and find myself way too many shirts. $71 later, I left, and went to Fiesta Fresh with the Hollands and Spencer. Then I went to Dana's house with the Hollands, Cory M, Big Nick V, Nick O, Anna B, Carson, and Mike Goode.

so i ahve the 25th annual putnam county spelling bee CD and it is great :) The music is awesome/cool harmonies & voices, and funny plot.

I couldn't find KK's ( i didnt look very hard though).

"event","ooo wow, i forgot that i didnt write about this

So guys i think @ maggies bday bash, mellow mushroom put a lil somethin somethin in my food. AKA food poisioning maybe? I don't exactly kno how/wat food poisioning is passed on, and no i'm not completely sure but:

i went to fiesta fresh with laura waller and got my usual coke, beans, n quesadilla. i was feeling real crappy (also a sign of me different) had one small bite and couldnt eat any more. This was more than 5 hours after lunch. so i feel crappy all night while i am watching Cuckoo's Nest (which was great). it was really wierd, the whole time i was concentrating on deep breaths and stuff, because i felt like i was going to throw up but we werne't near the exit. So intermission i went in the ~unisex~ bathroom and tried to throw up, but i couldnt. that felt wierd.. i felt like i was a victim of bulimia or something and that felt stupid, but i wanted to get it out so i could enjoy act 2. Ya so that didnt happen.
when i got home i threw up like a mother! SIDE NOTE, this is i believe the 2nd night out of many years that both of my parents were out of town, so ya.. i kept throwing up and it was nasty. then when i slept i couldnt sleep bc i woke up eveyr hour and tried to throw up again, bc i could still feel it coming, but wasn't successful every time. 

Yesterday i had a salad @ applebees (i didnt want to bail bc i hadnt seen every1 in a long time... and this was the first time i had made plans with tori, like,..ever)

ANYWAY IT SUCKED AND Now i feel mostly better... stomach still feels wierd at times.. but i am eating :)

LOL I still have the leftover calzone in my fridge... perhaps i should throw it away... although it might nto be the calzone (im guessing it is tho)... lol i should put skull-face poision sign on the mellow mushroom box. WARNING: MAY CONTAIN FOOD POISIONING

OK ANYWAY, that night trying to sleep and the throw-up thing SUCKED. I hope it never happens to any of u (anyone else fo rthat matter) and i especially hope everyone can have a healthy summer and be sick-free so they can enjoy summer.

if u HAVE to be sick, perhaps its better during school, where u can enjoy a day off w/ mom and chicken noodle soup watching disney movies on the pull-out bed in the living room... well thats what we do"

Why you'll love a Gemini:

Witty and sharp, a Gemini can keep up with your fast (and ever changing) mind.
You're both fun loving and free spirits. You and a Gemini can enjoy each other without expectations.

Why a Gemini will love you:

Not only can you keep up with a Gemini's sharp tongue, you can introduce a challenge or two...
You're appetite for fun and novelty will keep a Gemini interested - at least for a bit longer than usual!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsignisyourtruelovequiz/"">What Sign Is Your True Love?</a></div>

TUESDAY- My volleyball thing. In case anyone is wondering what this is I go to (because everyone always says ""HAVE FUN AT UR VOLLEYBALL THING""... lol.. here is what the ""THING"" is). This is a big ""THING"" for me! It is the Boys Junior Olympic Nationals for Indoor volleyball. (6-person teams) All of the best clubs from around the country earn their way into the tournament to play (of course it is a little easier for Southern teams because there isn't as much competition). It is in Minnesota. It is where all of the college scouts go to recruit because it is the best of the best! (NYU and Lees-McRae already told me they will be ther) The California and Hawaii teams are supposedly AMAZING. Our team is entered as an 18s (age) team because we have one kid that is 18, so the rest of us have to play ""up"" (""up"" as in ""in an older division""). I'm veryyy excited, although I don't have many expectations because my team is not great. We have about 3-4 really good people, and the rest are not very good at all. A few kids are 13! BUT I CANT WAIT>>>><<<
Also LATER in July i am going to BEACH Volleyball nationals (in Virginia) with Sean (teams of 2), who is also on this Atlanta team (he's from New Orleans, though). He's really good, and we should do really well as a team I think.

So now (i hope u read) u know about my trip this week :) :) :) wish me luck

~~~~~~~~~~Venting on audition process for colleges~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
so i've been doing a lot of reading/research of SEVERAL schools with the top MT (musical theater) programs, and YIKES... this winter/spring is going to be stressful! You have to audition for each one you are interested in (aka go to their campus for a day or 2) and first you have to apply to their college and get accepted academically. AND you need to pick several schools because they are all so very selective (AKA around 15-25 students tops in each program out of hundreds that audition). AND considering they are all mainly far away... so lots of traveling..which means lots of gas/flight/food/hotel $$ and my parents (especially my mom) gets so stressed whenever traveling, plus she hates spending money and is going to (understandably) make this process even more hectic b/c of that. 
I'm really excited to get started but also REALLY nervous! And the auditions (for most) you have to have 2 contrasting MT songs, 1 (sometimes 2) monologues, and they teach u a dance and you audition with it. yiiikes lol.
I'm also skeptical about this, just because performing as a career is so unreliable and difficult, where I could just be a teacher or boring accountant or something and be stable.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
POSSIBILITIES (good programs im thinking about)
<b>NYU</b> (bigger program, but still selective and the colelge is hard to get into as well)
<b>University of Michigan</b> (EXTREMELY selective -- one of the best in the nation!)
<b>Penn State</b> (This is looking like a good possibility. Big school so it would have a cool college environment, yet still a strong, top MT degree)
<b>Lees-McRae</b> (Not one of the top programs, but its a small school where you get a lotttt of attention and its degree is in Performing Arts, so you get to do all aspects of it: performing, technical theater, costuming/design, marketing, etc).
<b>Syracuse</b> (its in NY but in the middle of nowhere... don't know too much about it)
<b>Baldwin-Wallace College</b> very small, 12-14 people. concentrates in the music aspect
<b>University of Cincinnati - College Conservatory of Music</b>- good program.. dont kno 2 much"

i also have been doing LOADS of yearbook work ALREADY. But when I say ""yrbk work"", its fun work.. but takes up time. I basically flip through differne't school's yearbooks w/ postits of things i like, coverage ideas, modules, etc. I have to meet with J Sul and go over some stuff, and gotta meet with all of the section editors (eh) and design their grids by Jul 6 or something..

O >> FYI :) I started working out again today! No one was home so I blasted some music and lifted weights (many exercises), jump-roped, situps, etc... Probably about 45 minutes or so? I'm doing this for several reasons: Volleyball (Stronger the better, obviously), Track (ditto the volleyball reason), Musical Theater (no one in the real world wants skinny guy to have a lead role), personal satisfaction AKA so i can look/feel better/stronger.

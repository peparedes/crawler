"event","Ok, so this is the first time I'm emo for a pretty damn long time. People still suck, and I have three people who I wish I would never see, or talk to again, and be perfectly ok with it. One of the persons' mother just contacted me the other day, and I feel really badly about it, because she's such a beautiful woman, and sill likes me reguardless of what happened. Honestly I'm pissed about how that ended, but I believe that I said my piece and said person flaked out.

Next, the other person moved thousands of miles away, and I couldn't be happier with that. Honestly I wish he would just leave me alone and stop trying to figure out what I'm doing with my life, and figure out what he's doing with his. Stay out of my shit, and mind your biz. 

The third, fucked up this summer too. He is the one who doesn't know how to show a friend, emotion is necessary, and he has none. Heartless and detached from humanity never ends well for anyone. Then he tries to turn people on me, and it backfires, because hmmm, they love me. Boom biatch.

Then of course there are relationship issues, no I'm not over him, no I probably wont be for a while, but do I want to see him or think about him? Hell no. 

I drink wayyyyy too much, so I've stopped that. I had a pretty chief friend, but he turned stale when he began seeing someone and thought he was better than everyone else. He wasnt better than everyone else when he needed someone this summer and called me looking for advise or how to help him stop doing what he was, but it was ok for him, and not for me. Be human.

I'm lifting more than ever, which is good for a change. Hopefully some type of normalcy will come from that.

I've gotten a tattoo of those very important to me, tha fam. 

I went to Connecticut this summer with a friend, I should have realized the first time that any time you take a trip with friends they're trouble. I will never take a trip with a friend again, I will go with family, or by myself.

I have been talking to a couple of guys, though I'm not really all that interested in anyone, either they talk awkwardly, they are too needy, or they have some other type of quark that annoys the shiit out of me.

I've been taking some classes which are very important to graduation, I've changed a little, I'm going to class more, and studying a little more, but other than that, not much has changed. I'm hoping to graduate in may.

When I finish I'm moving up to my house and job in Connecticut, so good by Florida, hello mountains and snow.

All in all that has been my life. Like it or not, that is me, peace."

"event","Heh, I don't know what to say, where to start, where to go, or how to end, so I'm just going to start typing till everything I feel is on paper, or screen, minor technicality. I feel hurt, sad, depressed, betrayed, changed, hardened, but worst of all, lost. I don't know where to go, who to turn to, where I should pull my inspiration from, who I have to lean on, what is going to happen to me, or why it is that I still feel like shit. I've put up with stupid shit from one person for a year and a half, it's left me an empty shell of the original Sean. I don't want to fight anymore, I don't want to battle, I don't want any of the grief that comes along with what the person brings. I want to gain my power, my respect, my ambition, my sense of worth fullness, my friends, and most importantly my life. My relationship with one person has caused so much turmoil in my life that I have betrayed some of the best people in the world, I have neglected them and I have caused them all to run. So, where do I look for new friends? To money, which is the wrong answer, I should not have compromised my values, I should not have given into the pressure of resorting to that, and I should have just tried to glue together the shattered remains. I feel sad and depressed because I knew what was happening, and I let it continue, I didn't even try to stop it because I was blinded by something bigger than myself, I know, no excuse and I should have been able to control it, but now the hope and longing is gone, and I need to try to salvage what I can from the burning smolder that is my friendship.

I feel betrayal because one of the people who I hold dearest, the strongest people I know, cracked under the pressure of peers, fell under the weight of words. I don't think I've ever felt as hurt by someone who I've considered a friend. What has this done to me? It's hardened me, it's changed the way that I see people, it's changed the friendship dynamic completely. It's not that everyone is out for the good of society, no they're out for their own pleasure and to make themselves better, even at the sacrifice of someone else's feelings, and well being. It's made me become more hardened, because I feel as if I now have to protect myself instead of looking out for this person, and that no matter what I say or they say, it's not ever going to be the same.

At the same time as all of this, I feel lost, not having any sense of direction, I cannot simply live for an organization, I cannot simply live for the sake of living, what do I have to look forward to, what do I have to stand for? The only thing I wake up in the morning to do is go to class, the gym, and eat, that isn't a life for a KID, I stress again, a KID who was once vibrant, outgoing, and maybe nice (I stress maybe.). What do I have to do to get back on the path, grab the hors by the reins, and take control of my life again? Why am I stressing about something a year and a half long, which has been over for months? When am I going to feel like myself? Who can cause such turmoil to another human life? How do I just going to get back to ME?"

All I want for Christmas is love. I'm afraid that I wont find it when I leave college because of my chosen career path, and I'm worried that I'm not good enough for anyone of the people whom I've dated. I'd gladly give up everything I've asked for, and all the money I make in the year if I could find the right person. I'm sure you've gotten a billion of these, and I dont even know why I'm writing this to a forum, but hey, something is better than nothing. I guess I'll continue praying."

"event","What would you do if...?

1.  Some one spread a rumor about you? What if this person was an asshat to boot?
I would rise above them, ignore it for a while, if it kept on, I'd probably just go back to my old self.
2.  You could choose what work you could do. What would be your ideal job/position?
Police officer.
3.  You were driving through the endless fields of nothing in Kansas (it's a six hour drive from one side to the other on I-70)...and you came across a hitchhiker?
I'd have to leave them there, because you dont know what kind of a person it is, unless it's a nun or a priest, I'm not stoppin.
4.  You stepped into an elevator with your favorite porn star?
Well, the obvious would happen.
5.  You had to make a choice between dying or never having an orgasm ever again. Which would you choose?
Never having an orgasm again, because I get just as much joy seeing others do it as myself doing it.
6.  You could fly anywhere in the world for free tomorrow only. Where would you go, and who (or what) would you see?
I would fly to Meriden, CT, to see my big sister.
7.  You woke up in the middle of the night and you realized someone was breaking into your house/apartment? Fight or flight?
Fight of course, govt. issue glock says a lot in the face of an intruder.
8.  You could have either fame OR fortune, but not both? Would you be famous (possibly infamous) and not wealthy...or filthy rich and unknown?
Filty rich, because I wouldnt want to be smothered too much by people, at least if I'm rich I could spend it on a select few.
9.  Mobile phones were suddenly outlawed by the government because of risk of picking up government intelligence over the airwaves?
I dont think I would go crazy, I think I would have to go to the fbi so I could keep using one.
10.  You were a little tired of work at work and needed to waste time?
I would probably just sing a song to myself."

"event","I just got done thinking to myself, ""self, isnt it funny how life deals it's cards?""

All this stemmed from a wonderful day the other day:
I was driving down interstate 44 minding my own business in the middle of no where cruising in the company suburban at about 75 in a 55. Then, BAM MOTHER FUCKER, BAM! From the fucking opposite side of the road a cop flips the fuck around, and turns his lights on, I think oh, SHIT! I get the worst feeling I've ever gotten when being stopped by a cop, and I've had my fair share. It wasnt because I was scared, but because one day earlier I'd gotten my concealed weapons permit, and I was now carrying a gun in my company truck. I told him about it, showed him my permit took the gun out and gave it to him, he wrote my ticket and I was on my way home. A beautiful 186.00 ticket that I wanted was now in my posession.

Next day, I'm on my way down veteran's expressway in the middle of no where, cruising the speed limmit this time, and I get a call. ""Who the fuck could this be?"" I said. I answer it, ""this is so and so from Home Depot."" Nice! They wanna interview me for a managerial position at Home Depot. I'm like, fuckin awesome, now I can pay for my ticket and for the driver's class so they dont suspend my liscense. THANK YOU GOD for this blessed opportunity I think to myself.

Anyway, that's the extent of my excitement here in Crystal River, hope everything is going well for everyone else."

"event","Yea well, I've done about 60 hours worth of work in 6 days, son of a bitch making money is hard. I really need a vaca already. I'm trying to figure out when I can come to MIA and see all my bitches and hoes. 

Having fun spending time with my pops' this is the most time I've spent with him in well over three years, I honestly missed it.

Also catching up on some diving, which is especially excellente now that I have my new diving partner Matt. Former Coast Guard worker, he's awesome, down to Earth, just like me, and married. Josh is the one I work with the most, and he's really cool, he's like me a lot, but he has more of a country accent. Greg is the office lazy ass, all he does is make sure the fucking internet works all day. Wayne is the office dumb fuck, he knows nothing about nothing. Phill is the trainee, he's cool, but he's a little slow, I think he's the first person I've worked with like that. 

Finally, I miss all of the people from USF, hope you're having a good summer. Have to send a special shout out to the girls in E-Town."

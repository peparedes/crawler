"event","So I just finished my exams a few days ago, I can relax a bit now, at least until the time my grades are released XDD

Anyway, I seem to have missed a lot during the time I was absent from LJ, especially since so much has happened in the KKM fandom. The newest novel was released, two (I think) out of the five OVA's are now out, and there's now a third series of KKM due next year! And all this happened when I was absent.. o_o 

Also, I'm going back home to Malaysia this Saturday, it's been nearly half a year since I last went back. But I do hate taking the train to go back, it just eats up so much of my time... Oh well, at least it's taking me home ^^"

"event","I really don't want to do this, but my schedule this semester is pretty heavy, as of now I have two quizzes, a project report and an assignment all due next week. I'm finding it rather difficult to keep up with my workload and LJ at the same time, so I'll have to take a short hiatus from LJ until the beginning of December, when my exams will be over.. 

To everyone on my f-list, I'm sorry, I won't be able to keep up to date with all of you. I'll pop back into LJ whenever I have time, though. 

To anyone reading the translations of the KKM novels, gomen, I'll go back to translating the next chapter after my exams, I promise..

"event","Just read a post by a member on <lj comm=""death_note""> who brought attention to a website that's making profit out of fanfic while compensating the writers with t-shirts, prizes and gift certificates. 
The writers are also in danger of being charged of copyright violation since the owners of the website are apparently shunting all risks of copyright violation to the writers themselves.

I'm not an experienced fanfic writer, but something about the whole affair doesn't seem quite right to me. 

2222 fandoms are involved, including Harry Potter, KKM, Death Note etc. 
Anyone interested can check out the links below. They probably explain the whole situation much better than I can:

<img src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/vivarina/5243300.jpg"" />
I think it looks a bit scary, but it really emanates the mood of the manga, which is pretty dark sometimes....

This shows the whole cast for the movie

Okay, I think Light and 'L' look really cool here, plus I like the contrast of black and white as in 'darkness' versus 'light'"

"event","I just found out today that somebody erased all Wolfram's profiles on KKM pages on Wikipedia. In EVERY SINGLE LANGUAGE. This is beyond my comprehension.

That 'genius' fan is supposedly from Hong Kong, based on his/her IP address.

I understand that some fans might feel that they get too much of one chara sometimes, especially since novel version of Wolfram is loved a lot by Chinese KKM fans. However, what was she/he trying to do by erasing his profile from ALL pages of Wikipedia?? Trying to deny his existence? This is taking stupidity to a whole new level.

That fan certainly succeeded in annoying/angering me, though. A lot. 

I later found out that this 'genius' has been deleting Wolfram's profile repreatedly on the Japanese page. The Jap KKM fans have added his name back in again everytime that idiot deleted it. 

This is so embarassing. If the Japanese fans can cooperate despite their pairing preferences, why is it that fans outside Japan are acting in such an immature way??"

"event","Just found out today that the first OVA will be featuring Saralegui, king of Shou Shimaron. Wonder what plot the OVA will have about him.

He's a really attractive bishounen, based on Yuuri's description of him. Yuuri compared Saralegui to moonlight, as opposed to Wolfram as sunlight. I keep feeling that it may also be due to the hair color (white-ish blonde vs. gold).

However, despite how he looks, I can't really say that I like him ^^;
I haven't even gotten to the part of the novels where he tortures Yuuri, but after what he said about the Shinzoku... 
 
Am REALLY looking forward to the OVA's  *fangirl cheer*"

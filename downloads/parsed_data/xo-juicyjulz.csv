OH MY GOSH, don't worry about this next comment, I'm not anorexic or anything, but I haven't eaten in like three days because my reflux is getting really bad, and my pills are expired, so my tummy's all messed up, and my pants don't fit. =( I'm sad about thar. But let me tell you, Sarah is a very good tummy-rubber-person, haha physics. I guess everything's worked out with the Carolyn and Sarah thing, which makes me feel better, I guess we'll see where it goes, and it will take time no matter what the outcome is. &lt;3 I still have to think about going to east next year or not, right now, my <STRONG>dad </STRONG>actually, said that it will <STRONG>""take a lot for me to stay at sem""</STRONG> which was suprising because I thought that he was all gung-ho about sem. The only thing that worries me now is that I made such a big deal about needing to go to sem, that if I want to stay at sem, I might not be able to.

"event","OKAY, so I thought I was doing okay with handling the whole ""depression"" thing, if you want to call it that, but then I keep thinking, I have no one to talk to, like no one who's really there for me, and that sucks because I can't like keep everything in all the time. Like i have Caitlin, who I can pick up a conversation with at any moment, but it's not the same because she's not here. And Lexi, I have her too, but there's not much to talk about. Like, I just wish it was last year again, it was so much better. And I think I'm going to call Caitlin and Lexi tonight, and see if they want to do something this weekend. I miss them too much. They've always been there for me, and they would never not be there for me, I know it for a fact, and I just wish there were people like that here at sem, I'm sure there are, but I'm having such a hard time finding them. IF YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON AND YOU WANNA BE MY BESTEST FRIEND FOREVER AND EVER, COME FIND ME!!  :(

OMFG how I miss last year and my Caitlin and Lex-us <33 :( It makes me sad! I talked to Lex-us during Ski club yesterday. It was so sad. All we talk about now-a-days is Eric, and East because we don't have much to talk about anymore. It's so depressing.

But look on the brightside, I got to talk on the phone with three of my bestest friends who I don't see anymore, that's a plus if you ask me :)

Then we went to the movies..it was Me, Christine, Mike, Matt, and Vinny. We saw 'White Noise' and it was soooo scary, but I didn't really understand it because I was talking to Matt the whole movie, about random things. We all def. changed hoodies about 10x because I was cold, it was like this massive hot potatoe game, only with hoodies. Wow. Then I practically JUMPED on Matt for the scarrry part, and I almost died. Me and Christine were grabbing on to eachother the whole time, and I almost like ripped her knee off. Before we went to the movies, inbetween the mall and movies, we went to Taco Bell, and the scary greasy man gave Christine her drink for free...it was ackward..

So, I went to Caitlin's around two, and Lexi was over. We had some fun, and ate sooooooo much it's not even funny. We had popcorn, Ramen noodle soup [my first time ever having those noodly-things] some tostidos pizza things, and I had two packs of gushers, and a pack of spongebob gummies  :]

I had so much fun, then Lexi left around four to go to church, and me and Caitlin went online and looked up random things, then we watched GOTHICA, scariest thing I've ever seen! Although, not as bad as Identity..Caitlin knows better than to let me watch these horrible movies! She should be making sure I don't get too scared, because god knows that show ""Hey Arnold"" on Nickelodeon scares the bageebers out of me [ I get scared VERY easily].

But anyways, that's it Mr. Malcolm is changing our exam to three days earlier..stinks. Oh well, good thing I've been studying!  :D

I kinda feel bad, I haven't talked to Carolyn and Sarah, ro anyone for that matter in about three days, and I should call them, but I call too much and I always feel super annoying. Our whole little ""group"" if you wanna call it that, probably hung out without me, I wouldnt be suprised, BUT THEN AGAIN I'M JUST PARANOID, AREN'T I!!

We had fun! We went sledding and got yelled at by some guy who told us the park was closed, I definatly told him that I was deaf and he was being predjudice for not using sign language, of course I had to translate to him with my hands. Stupid Hicks. Anyways then we watched Thirteen, scariest movie I've ever seen, I'm so freaked out now. I swear it didn't influence me..NOT. Then in the morning me, hovel, carolyn and emily went skiing. It was my first time ever going skiing! I was really bad. They took me on the ""main hill"" which I like to call ""Never go on if it's your first day skiing, you're better off on the bunny hill"" and well, let's just say I ran into a tree, got fed up, and def. walked halfway down the hill.

But anyways, I'm not excited for Christmas at all. It's really weird, like I haven't even wrapped presents yet, and I refused to put any ornaments on the tree, because it's a fake tree, and I only like the real ones. :]  I know, I'm such a brat. Anyways, break has been amazing..not.


I've been having spaz attacks A LOT lately, like I've been flipping out on people non-stop. I think the whole depression things coming back. Speaking of that, Sarah I'm sorry I made you like..die. :(  I love you! Sorry!!

KiSSMAS BASH 2004- Wow! This was by far the most amazing concert I've ever been to in my whole entire life! I can't even like explain half of it, because I'm still in such shock! So, I'll start from the very beginning.

I went to Carolyn's aunt's house with her and Sarah because we were getting ready there with everyone later. So, we got there, and her mom had to go get some stuff so we were just hanging out. Carolyn took a shower and practically flashed us..it was bad! Sarah washed her hair in the sink while I was sitting on her back trying to see how long I could balance. Anyways, we got ready then Emma came over, then Abi, Zoe, Allie, Michele, Lauren, and finally Emily. We ate pizza and dolled-up even more and then we left.

We had seats in the 300s level ($17 tickets..LMAO) So of course, we went seat hopping! We got kicked out of a few rows, but finally Emily found her Ski friend, Lindsay, and we sat with her because she -for some reandom reason- had like 10 extra tickets..but anyways we were FOURTH ROW! AND WE WERE RIGHT NEXT TO BACK STAGE! WE GOT ALL THESE AUTOGRAPHS IT WAS AMAZING!!

SWITCHFOOT- My favorite band of all times..okay, they got out there and I was like bawling because I was so excited to see them, I couldn't believe I was actually seeing them, I was about to die of happiness. It was bad. Then Sarah got to go back stage to see them with her OP friends, and I made her hug my fav. guy for me. Ahhhhh..and then he ran into the aud. and I like touched him..ahhhhhhh....

GAVIN DEGRAW, GOOD CHARLOTTE, SIMPLE PLAN, AVRIL LAVIGNE, JOJO, 7 DAY FAITH, SKY SWEEDNAM, SWITCHFOOT AND VANESSA CARLTON WERE AMAZING!
So anywways, The concert was amazing for our measly $17


Then we went back to Emma's and we slept over. I love how you can totally be 100% NOT (I repeat, NOT) a lesbian and if you're at a school with all girls you can't get out of spooning. It's bad guys. Spooning wars. Wow. What fun times, it was amazing, and we had a great time. BAHh..ERRKHAHHA. Sarah and Carolyn Raped me like 20 times, it was sooooo bad, and Sarah had a massive obsession with my belly-button because it's an outie. Heehee.


So anyways, that was my amazing Friday, I know you're all jealous,..you know you love me mucho!

I've been working so hard! I'm about to make a picturetrail thing so I can post the pictures I just got!

I'm getting better with the whle depressed thing. I guess it comes and goes, and I just need to know when to control things so they don't get out of hand again. Sarah and Carolyn, sorry for the scare, it won't happen again.

"event","Well. Let me see. Gym was crazy! I was extra beastly, I don't think I ever worked that hard in gym at Heim, but I guess it's different when you are at an all girls school, and no one cares if you get sweaty..Rachel had a shadow today, and then she threw-up so she went home, I kind of felt bad for her shadow! Then Sarah had a shadow, and Sarah being the massive druggie we know she is, drugged her shadow with candy! What she was thinking, I don't know, but her shadow was, let's say ""extra perky"" from then on. Ay. Then me and Sarah were suppost to both ""get the flu/a cold"" tomorrow so we didn't have to go to school, but that didn't work out too well, because I actually DO feel sick, and I'm going to go to school tomorrow anyways, because I'd feel way too guilty! So, that's that. The Canisus dance was better than the other ones, I personally thought, except for the lack of guys. I danced with a lot of the guys though, which is weird, I think it's the fact that my braces were off :) but most of my friends didn't have fun because they didn't dance with a lot of guys, but it's usually me without the guys, and them with the guys, so I kind of had my glory moment! Let's see, what else has been going on? I hear rumors are being spread about me randomly in North. Good riddance, they can say whatever they want about me, because, thank god I don't have to put up with thouse people anymore! I'm almost out of proctored, and I'm so excited! I've been working really hard, and it's finally working out! FREE PERIODS HERE I COME! We're doing this complete BS report in Physics ans Spanish where we have to pick a topic related to Physics, and do the poster and present it in Spanish, or French. HOW RETARDED IS THAT!? Just be happy you don't have to do it (unless you're a freshman at sem). So, that's pretty much it, except the fact that I have to have to responsibility for doing secret santas for my group, and I've never done those before, we're getting out of hand of people though, we might as well have to whole freshman class do it, but I just can't say no to people who ask me if they can be included! Carolyn, on the other hand, has NO PROBLEM saying ""No"" to people. Poor Ellen, her grandpa died, and I FELT HORRIBLE! Whatcha gonna do though? All you can do is say your sorry. I feel terrible. Well, this has been WAY too long, and I have a lot more homework to do, and my arms are killing! LOL! Leave some love!

The Canisus dance is tomorrow I can't wait! OMG! I just got my period like 3 minutes into walking into the school building. This sucks so much. I'm going to cry. I have had mine for every Canisus, and St.Joes dance so far! ERRR! I need tampons, but my mom will only buy the cardboard ones, and they hurt :[

I don't have much to say lately..Let's see, date dance was retarded, there's a canisus dance coming up on friday, and I'm not sure if I want to go or not. Who knows? Sarah and I were talking about how there is no drama at school at all, not that I want any, but it's ackward. Who knows. I'm like failing out of school, and I'll probably end up at south in January. I don't really know what I think about that. I'm so confused lately. I haven't updated in a long time, because I don't have frees anymore because I'm on academic probation. Oh yess! I didn't have school today, and me and Sarah need boyfriends! So, I'm going to go, and if I still have ANY lj friends anymore maybe I'll get some comments.

Anyways, I went to church today and I had fun, I helped the little kids, and I was told that I have to be ""Batgirl"" or ""Tinkerbell"" for halloween, but how do you tell a four year old that you're not allowed to go out? And then I went to my class and we talked about abortion. That was pretty one sided though, because we all pretty much agree with eachother. I know I haven't updated in a long time, and I feel bad about that but I've been in proctored studyhall for the past three weeks, which means that I don't have free periods anymore. It's absolutly horrible. So, now, no one comments me anymore. Anyways, I want to see what else I need to post. I need a date for my date dance! I really need one really badly! I am getting my braces off three days before date dance, and I have my dress, so now all I need is my date!

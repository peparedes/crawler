<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is associated with Venus, the feminine planet, so it represents, 
beauty, charm, pleasure, luxury, and delight. You&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;good&nbsp;at&nbsp;home 
decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.</font></p>
<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is a creator, be it creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.</font></p>

I finished this book about a month back. I have too lazy to put this entry up. I blame it on the festive season, the booze and all the dramas.

Anyway, Jodi Picoult has to be my new most respected American writer , to date. I read her bestseller - Sister's keeper, a few years back. This is the second of hers that I picked up. This has been such a compelling read, if not better than my previous read.

"event","And so it is, the last entry of the year. I try to recollect if I have changed over the span of 365 days. Or any strong urge to accomplish a certain task before the year comes to a close.

***************************
I am more diligent at work this year than the previous. I worked towards my goal. And it seems to be in positive light.

I have few regrets this year. More blessings to count in fact. 
Jon found a job in Sg and got promoted sooner than we got to celebrate New year. Kian and I cleared our misunderstanding this year. We became closer than ever. Babe and j grew stronger. Cris opened her first salon and matured quite a bit. All my friends were very encouraging in times of need and also gave me the space when needed. In a nutshell, it has been a very smooth-sailing year. It became quite a worry of mine if the next year will be better ever.

I guess the best way of embracing 2008 is with absolutely no expectations for anything or anyone, except myself. 

In 2008, I want to better myself, better my life. Let that be my 2008 resolution."

Though I am a massive fan of Haruki, I have to admit that his latest book - After Dark , was hardly palatable. I couldnt stop when I started on her new book , THe Devil's Whisper. She is rather unique in her way of writing, i have to say. What sufaces to be a detective novel reveals so much more of social issues faced in the current. I like it a lot. In fact, I have been teling everyone about it.

I went with Jon to watch this play at Waterloo street yesterday. We didnt expect it to be anything more than some abstract plot. It turn out to be really good and engaging. Both of us walked out , agreeing that it was one of the better local production that we have watched.

I love the analogy about crows in relation to Singapore's penal code especially. It was very interesting how they describe queers as crows -We are inevitable in the presence of humans. How humans ignore their general presence and never wanting to hear them sing. They are the ones that seems alright to be culled and shot."

I pondered for the last two weeks. I even dreamt of it. 
I do not know how I could resolve this issue.
I tried, early this year. But it was really tough.

I know it sounds very unfilial to be shooting this out : But sometimes, I feel that she is just like a black hole. She literally sucks every emotion and soul out of it. She never fails to make me feel bad about not giving enough to the family. Not being as good as my brother. Not being as docile as I should have been. And perhaps, for the very fact that I love men. Year after year, she refused to admit or talk about my sexuality , even though I have been transparent to all my folks about it. 

I pop her a text back finally: : "" After all these years, have you ever asked me how I have been surviving on my own ? Or asked me if I have been happy? Its not that I do not want to tell you mum. You never asked. You never really bother.""

I am concerned about everyone. From my inner circle of friends to the people who are born in brothels.
I will think about the spending time with each and all my loved ones. making sure that I will be there to catch them when they are down. I want to be there, literally, for all my loved ones. Making sure that I pay my dues to the charity that I believe etc.
So I told myself that instead of lettin it pass like the previous time, I am going to chuck my big ego aside and talk to him about it.
Dodging the issue is the big issue. 
Or so I can say , its one big hurdle behind us now. :=)

I appreciate all of you who had shown so much concern for the past week and have given me the space taht I needed to sort things out."

I started to watch my fave sitcom Will & Grace. 
Jon recommended it to me and I was hooked since.
I bought Season 2 to 5 off amazon.

I was watching season two like night.
It was unfortunately aptly for the episode I watched was Will finding out that Grace was called by Mike, Will's ex, to do up his townhouse in Manhatten. As Grace lived next door to Will, it was a chanced meet-up that they met on the doorway leading to the lift. Mike flattered Will looking as good as before. And before you know it, Will starts to think that he finally could revive and continue the seven years relationship that he had with Mike. Bingo, Will initiated going over to mike's new place and found out that he has been attached two months since they broke up.

There was one scene that reminds myself of me. Mike was eating some cakes and walking at the same time. It irks Will to have the carpet witth crumbs and it goes on for seven years and finally, the messy mike left the clean freak Will saying that he is too controlling.. 

Its a comedy series. I wonder why i tear."

The trip was very good. We had a very good driver. Every night was candlelight dinner on the beach. Seafood felt so much nicer having sea breeze keeping you cosy.

We tried a lot of different cusine in Bali/Lombok this round. I guess there are a lot of travellers opening restaurant(s) there. The italian food/french food is great and at a very reasonable price.

The only compaint Jon had was DAVA restaurant in Ritz. But I didnt agree to that . Perhaps I wasnt usint my credit card that day, that's why. :=) DAVA restaurant is reputed to be one of the best in Bali. It was awesome. We were chaffeured there. The reception area of the restaurant was a pavillion in the middle of a water terrace. There did such a good job that it was like the exact scene in ""Winter, summer and spring again"" - like a pavillion floating in the middle of a lake in wilderness. When we entered the dining place, it was just as impressive. It was a restaurant on top of water terraces, facing the Indian Ocean. We were in our Sunday's best that night, we did not bring camera that night. It was a bit of a waste though. But still, company was really good. They had a variety of 50 martinis by the bar at the right of the restaurant. We ordered three. We loved the lemongrass martini. It was very good. Ya, we drank ourselves silly almost  everynight. And i really love Bintang beer there. Though Jon prefers our homegrown Tiger beer still.

Food was too exotic and tiny in protion for jon's liking. I love my raspberry scouffle! it was yummylicious.

Here are bits of the photos that I fancy:

This man loves his children.

I was completely zoned out after work on saturaday afternoon. Tried this massage place in Upper Thomson Road and I am really satisfied with the entire experience. Firstly, I only paid forty bucks for an hour. THe place was clean. The auntie masseur is really skilled. Mister Birch says I looked much relaxed after the massage. The only issue , or two, is that I have to wear a disposable underwear - which turn me off completely. Second - A female masseur. Call me a true blue queer or whatever. I am never comfortable with females having close contact. But I am going for it this weekend again. 

This afternoon, I tried a very good , and yet again affordable, high tea. Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I detest going for buffet. Its so uncontrollable and that two hours meal is gonna kill my two weeks gym regime. But this is really a blast. Even Mister Birch attest to it! It's Peranakan buffet at Goodwood park hotel. Its $22 inclusive of everthing. I love Perankan food. Yummylicious! I was just telling Shaun and Crist that I will bring them there to try after dave's exam. 

The last part of the night was rather wasted though. Even though Birch paid for the tickets, I find it a complete waste of time to watch Summer Palace. Its not a love story, not a revolutionary film. Its just plain, mindless sex and lust. I got into an argument with a bunch of PRCs who hoarded our seats, shoving us to another. Knowing Birch, he just stood there almost obliging. And knowing myself even better, I stood up and told them to get off, when the movie has just started rolling. They were embarassed and moved off. I cant believe how disconnected these folks are. Geez. Just dun get into my path.

I have a thousand and one worries yet only a hundred and one wishes.
Like what I told Mister lee just now, we are not poles apart. It is just that we manage our fears differently.

Perhaps it runs in the blood, but I have a very obstinate approach in dealing with fear.
Whenever I am frightful or insecure and sad about something, I will find all means to find something to smile or laugh about. Most of the time, I will not even mind making a fool of myself, just to make myself and people around me laugh. Just to make sure that the fear/sorrow doesnt linger enough to destroy your day. Indeed, at the end of the day, you may still feel sad. But after a while, the battle will definitely be won.

Laugh the sorrows again.
Its not easy. Its something you have to wake up and tell yourself it's a little something you need to do for just yourself.

It's not the stillness of the dark that will eventually kill us. 
But the lingering prick gnawing in our mind that - ""this is it"". 
This is darkness at the end. Not even a gleam of light at sight.

There is nothing we can do. We have to turn back. 
However, we can choose if we wanna walk back in dignity or scurry back in despair . No one says walkng away from a dead end is cheating and having frivolous faith in life. 
It just have to dawn upon us that we have turn back and look for alternatives in the labyrinth.

"event","An Interview with Haruki Murakami
<i>
What made you want to retell the Oedipus myth? Did you have a plan to do this when you started Kafka On The Shore or did it come about during the writing? </i>
The Oedipus myth is just one of several motifs and isn't necessarily the central element in the novel. From the start I planned to write about about a fifteen-year-old boy who runs away from his sinister father and sets off on a journey in search of his mother. This naturally linked up with the Oedipus myth. But as I recall, I didn't have that myth in mind at the beginning. Myths are the prototype for all stories. When we write a story on our own it can't help but link up with all sorts of myths. Myths are like a reservoir containing every story there is. 
<i>
With the exception of Norwegian Wood, your novels, especially this new one, have a very dreamlike fantasy element to them. What is it that drives you into this realm? </i>
Norwegian Wood is, as you've said, the only one written in a realistic style. I did this intentionally, of course. I wanted to prove to myself that I could write a 100% realistic novel. And I think this experiment proved helpful later on. I gained the confidence I could write this way; otherwise it would have been pretty hard to complete the work that came afterwards. For me, writing a novel is like having a dream. Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I'm still awake. I can continue yesterday's dream today, something you can't normally do in everyday life. It's also a way of descending deep into my own consciousness. So while I see it as dreamlike, it's not fantasy. For me the dreamlike is very real. 
<i>
A quick Google search shows off the many fans you have in America, all eagerly awaiting your next novel. As a Japanese novelist, why do you think your fiction resonates so strongly with this audience? </i>
I think people who share my dreams can enjoy reading my novels. And that's a wonderful thing. I said that myths are like a reservoir of stories, and if I can act as a similar kind of ""reservoir,"" albeit a modest one, that would make me very happy. 
<i>
What are some aspects of Japanese culture that you think a reader can glean from your novels? Are there other characteristics that you wish we Americans understood before we even picked up the books? </i>
When I write a novel I put into play all the information inside me. It might be Japanese information or it might be Western; I don't draw a distinction between the two. I can't imagine how American readers will react to this, but in a novel if the story is appealing it doesn't matter much if you don't catch all the detail. I'm not too familiar with the geography of nineteenth century London, for instance, but I still enjoy reading Dickens. 

Before ""postmodernism"" became a buzzword, Franz Kafka explored that particular condition of isolation associated with a post-nuclear, new-millennium world. Did you name your protagonist after him to draw out these themes, or were there other reasons?
It goes without saying that Kafka is one of my very favorite writers. But I don't think my novels or characters are directly influenced by him. What I mean is, Kafka's fictional world is already so complete that trying to follow in his steps is not just pointless, but quite risky, too. What I see myself doing, rather, is writing novels where, in my own way, I dismantle the fictional world of Kafka that itself dismantled the existing novelistic system. One could view this as a kind of homage to Kafka, I suppose. To tell the truth, I don't really have a firm grasp of what's meant by postmodernism, but I do have the sense that what I'm trying to do is slightly different. At any rate, what I'd like to be is a unique writer who's different from everybody else. I want to be a writer who tells stories unlike other writers'. 
<i>
Throughout this book, you reference the ""Rice Bowl Hill incident,"" in which a group of children lost consciousness during a school outing in the hills. Do the fictional investigations of this incident have a basis in real historical events or news stories? Did your experience as a journalist inform this part of the novel? </i>
I'd rather not go into that. 
<i>
Nakata, the other main character, is a lovable victim of the school disaster who is unlike everyone around him. What led you to create this sort of character? </i>
I'm always interested in people who've dropped out of society, those who've withdrawn from it. Most of the people in Kafka on the Shore are, in one sense or another, outside the mainstream. Nakata is most definitely one of them. Why did I create a character like him? It must be because I like him. It's a long novel, and the author has to have at least one character he loves unconditionally. 
<i>
Cats appear frequently in your fiction, and in this book they play a particularly memorable role, what with the detailed description of how a deranged sculptor preys on cats. Why are cats so important to your characters and your stories? </i>
It must be because I'm personally fond of cats. I've always had them around since I was little. But I don't know whether they have any other significance. 
<i>
Your protagonist Kafka discovers a song, ""Kafka on the Shore,"" and wonders if the woman who wrote it knew what the lyrics meant. Another character says, ""Not necessarily. Symbolism and meaning are two separate things."" Since your novel and the song share a title, how much does this statement say about the the novel itself? Do its symbols point to a larger meaning? </i>
I don't know a whole lot about symbolism. There seems to me to be a potential danger in symbolism. I feel more comfortable with metaphors and similes. I don't really know what the lyrics of the song mean, or whether they even have any meaning in the first place. It might be much easier to understand if someone set the lyrics to music and sang it. 
<i>
We hear that your Japanese publisher has actually produced a website to help readers understand the meaning of this book. Since we won't be able to read the site, can you tell us in your own words what some of the ""secrets"" of the book are? </i>
On this website in the space of three months I received over 8,000 questions from readers, and personally responded to over 1,200 of them. It was a lot of work, but I really enjoyed it. What I concluded from this exchange was that the key to understanding the novel lies in reading it multiple times. This may sound self-serving, but it's true. I know people are busy and it depends, too, on whether they feel like doing it, but if you have the time, I suggest reading the novel more than once. Things should be clearer the second time around. I've read it, of course, dozens of times as I rewrote it, and each time I did, slowly but surely the whole started to come into sharper focus. 

Kafka on the Shore contains several riddles, but there aren't any solutions provided. Instead several of these riddles combine, and through their interaction the possibility of a solution takes shape. And the form this solution takes will be different for each reader. To put it another way, the riddles function as part of the solution. It's hard to explain, but that's the kind of novel I set out to write. 
<i>
All of your characters, both in this book and in previous novels, display a really interesting appreciation for jazz, classical, and rock music. What musical pieces would you include on a Murakami playlist of sorts that would represent the range of music in your books? </i>
Music is an indispensable part of my life. Whenever I write a novel, music just sort of naturally slips in (much like cats do, I suppose.) When I was writing my newest novel, After Dark, the melody of Curtis Fuller's ""Five Spot After Dark"" kept running through my head. Music always stimulates my imagination. When I'm writing I usually have some Baroque music on low in the background chamber music by Bach, Telemann, and the like. 
<i>
Being an author who is read in translation, could you talk a little bit about what you think makes a good translation? </i>
I've translated a lot of American literature into Japanese, and I think that what makes a good translator is, above all, a feel for language (a pretty obvious point) and also a great affection for the work you're translating. If one of those elements is missing the translation won't be worth much. Unless I have to for some reason, I seldom reread my previous books (in Japanese), but I do sometimes reread the English translations. I find it enjoyable precisely because of the distance from the original text. In most cases I really enjoy reading these. 
<i>
What's next for you? </i>
In the fall of 2004 I brought out a new novel, After Dark. And in the U.S. in 2006 we'll publish my second short story collection in English, my first since The Elephant Vanishes. So in anticipation of that, I'll be working on some new short stories this fall and winter. On the translation side, I'm presently translating a collection of Grace Paley's short stories. I really like her work. Translating her stories is very difficult, but I always do my very best.

"event","Its an overdue post. I have been so busy with squeezing work , an extra hour at gym and a bit of combat and running, after the birthday weekend.

I have gained 10 pounds over the last 2 months . All my dearies , thanks to Patrick's unprofessional photography who cast me in the worst light, have been mortified by the Sentosa pics. I was cleaved by literally everyone on the knight's table on saturaday.

Naturally, I take such in stride. Constructive comments call for immediate actions. Time to get my butt off to gain back my abs. Honey, we dun need to wait for Xmas to shed that extra pounds. *wink David*

On a more serious note, I received two 18 years old birthday card this year. Thanks to all my very sensitive frens and Mister Birch. 

I hope this year brings me 
1. More regional exposure at work. 
2. More tolerance to incompetence
3. Better acceptance to changes around me
4. Not hate anyone
5. Love and treasure my loved ones more
6. Shed that extra pound

======
 Yes. I want to thank Babe, Mister Birch , The Ugly Dolls and the rest for making my very first bithday celebration in Sg, for the last six years, so joyous and warm.

I do appreciate all the arrangements etc. 

Kisses xxx"

I was ranting to Christina over yoga today how I have gained weight over the past few months. I was getting over paranoid that it may be the arrival of metabolism retardation. I am extremely particular of the love handles that I have amassed over the past months. 

How nic it will be a day where I will stop passing judgement on myself. On others.

Simply having expectations without judgement.

That will be one swell day."

 I came home just now to find my first birthday present this year on my desk. Coincidentally, Dorothy called just about the same time as I was opening the present. It was super sweet talking to her while I opened the gift of luck and blessings from Janet and her.

Time flies. Other than EH, she is one of the longest pal that I still kept in contact with. It has been six years. I am grateful for her friendship and I know my pals in HK will always accept me for however I act and , though miles apart, be there for me as much as they can when i am feeling down.

When I broke up with Dez a year plus back, I was in HK for quite a fair bit of time. I dragged Dorothy and Miss Hau to visit this tarot reader to ask about the entire romance. I was given a very negative reading and was really fighting back tears at that moment. I was relieved they were all there with me through the Asahi beers and sushi.

So this entry is to extend my heartfelt gratitude to friends like all you people. [Including my ugly-dolls gang in sg]. For just doting on me the way I am.

P.S Dorothy and Janet, see you both in HK in June!"

Marjorie Dawes from the fats-fighter club. She is demeaning. Has an absolute wicked sense of humor. And she encourages everyone to literally ""eat dust"" to lose weight. She is my number one fave in the show!

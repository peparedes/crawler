My mom gave me the OK to dropout but im not gonna do that, yet anyways.  Tryin to atleast stick around until next year when I go for a fall course at CFCC.  Until then im probably still gonna have an on-off schedule at ashley, which is pretty good considering in the beg of the year i was waiting to turn 16 JUST to drop out.  I fucking hate it at that school, but friends and nicci have made it better than usual :)

Although whenever i have any fun at ashley theres usually a 50% of me getting in trouble for something lol
